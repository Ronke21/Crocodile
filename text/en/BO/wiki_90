<text>Air Berlin plc &amp; Co. Luftverkehrs KG (), branded as airberlin or airberlin.com, was a major German airline. At its peak, it was Germany&#x27;s second-largest airline after Lufthansa, as well as Europe&#x27;s tenth-largest airline in terms of passengers carried. It was headquartered in Berlin and had hubs at Berlin Tegel Airport and Düsseldorf Airport. At the time of its insolvency, it was a member of the Oneworld airline alliance, having joined in 2012.

The airline was originally founded by American interests in 1978 to provide airline service to West Berlin, a territory that could not legally be served by West German airlines such as Lufthansa due to political restrictions on East German airspace. In 1991, shortly after German reunification, Air Berlin became a German-owned company and shifted its core business to compete more directly with Lufthansa, eventually becoming one of Germany&#x27;s biggest airlines. After years of losses, however, Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August 2017 and ceased operations two months later.

==History==
===1978–1990: American charter airline in West Berlin===


Originally registered as Air Berlin USA, the company was founded in 1978 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lelco, an American agricultural enterprise headquartered in Oregon, to operate charter flights on behalf of German tour operators from Berlin Tegel Airport, mostly to Mediterranean holiday resorts.

The co-founders of Air Berlin USA were:
* Kim Lundgren, a former Berlin-based flight engineer of Pan American World Airways;
* John MacDonald, a former station manager of United States supplemental and charter airline Saturn Airways at Berlin Tempelhof Airport in the 1960s and subsequent general manager Europe and vice president at the Berlin Tegel Airport base of the former United States supplemental carrier and charter airline Modern Air from 1968 until 1974;
* Mort Beyer, Modern Air&#x27;s executive vice president from 1967 until 1971 as well as the airline&#x27;s president and vice president of the National Air Carrier Association in 1971 and founder of United States aviation consultancy Avmark.

Lelco was the agriculture business of Kim Lundgren&#x27;s family in the United States.

As a United States airline, Air Berlin was able to access the West Berlin airline market. During the Cold War, Berlin&#x27;s special political status meant that the air corridors into and out of Tegel Airport could only be used by airlines registered in France, the United Kingdom or the United States. The airline&#x27;s headquarters were initially at Tegel Airport. Leonard Lundgren was the first chairman.

After the company was issued an airline licence and acquired two Boeing 707 jet airliners previously owned by Trans World Airlines, Air Berlin USA commenced revenue services on 28 April 1979 with a flight from Berlin-Tegel to Palma de Mallorca. Plans were made to start long-haul flights on West Berlin-Brussels-Florida routes, in cooperation with Air Florida (an agreement to that effect had been signed in February 1979).

In 1980, two Boeing 737-200s were leased from Air Florida. In 1981, Air Berlin USA continued its weekly scheduled Boeing 707 service on the Berlin Tegel Airport - Brussels - Orlando route; however, by 1982, the 707s had been phased out, and during most of the 1980s, Air Berlin USA operated only a single 737-200 or (from 1986) a 737-300. In 1990 and 1991, two Boeing 737-400s were also placed into service.

===1990–2000: New investors and expansion===

German reunification led to significant changes to the European aviation market, and in particular in Berlin: German airlines now gained access to the city. In 1991, Air Berlin (which had 90 employees at the time) was restructured as Air Berlin GmbH &amp; Co. Luftverkehrs KG, a German-registered company, with several German investors joining Kim Lundgren, the original founder, thereby bringing the ownership in line with German foreign-control requirements. Joachim Hunold (de), a former sales and marketing director with LTU International, now led the company.

Following an order for ten Boeing 737-800s, Air Berlin grew and by 1999, the fleet grew to twelve aircraft. In 2001, Air Berlin and Hapag-Lloyd Flug became the first airlines in the world to have their Boeing 737-800s fitted with blended winglets, wingtip devices that are intended to improve fuel efficiency.

Air Berlin introduced scheduled flights (which could be booked directly with the airline rather than via a tour operator) in 1997, initially linking a number of secondary German airports to Mallorca. By 2002, 35 percent of Air Berlin&#x27;s tickets were sold directly. In the same year, the airline expanded beyond holiday destinations as low-fare flights marketed as &quot;City Shuttle&quot; to London, Barcelona, Milan and Vienna started. Besides Berlin-Tegel, these routes were opened at six German airports (Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Münster/Osnabrück, Nuremberg, and Paderborn/Lippstadt) that until then had not been served by one of the rising European low-cost carriers. In what later became a hallmark for Air Berlin as a &quot;semi-low cost carrier&quot;, the airline offered complimentary meals and seat reservations, in contrast to its competitors Buzz, Hapag-Lloyd Express, Ryanair and Virgin Express.

===2000–2006: Becoming Germany’s second-largest airline===
In November 2001, the delivery flight of a Boeing 737-800 fitted with winglets set a record: the aircraft with the registration code D-ABBC flew 8,345 kilometres non-stop from Seattle (Boeing Field), USA to Berlin (TXL), Germany in 9 hours, 10 minutes.

In January 2004, Air Berlin announced it would cooperate with Niki, a Vienna-based airline. As part of the deal, Air Berlin took a 24% stake in Niki.

In 2005, the Group reorganised its corporate structure. It established Air Berlin plc (registered in England) into which it reversed Air Berlin GmbH &amp; Co. Luftverkehrs KG and subsidiaries. It was suggested that the reason for the group to establish a UK-based PLC instead of a German-based AG was to avoid the need to have a supervisory board and employee representation as required by the German law of &quot;Mitbestimmung&quot; or co-determination.

In 2006, Air Berlin went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Originally scheduled for 5 May 2006, the IPO was postponed to 11 May 2006. The company said the delay was due to rises in fuel costs and other market pressures limiting investor demand. It reduced the initial share-price range from 15.0 to 17.5 euros to 11.5–14.5 euros. The stock opened at €12.0, selling a total of 42.5 million shares. Of these, 19.6 million were new shares increasing capital in the company, and the remainder to repay loans extended by the original shareholders and invested in the company earlier in 2006. After the IPO, the company claimed to have over 400 million euros in cash to fund further expansion, including aircraft purchases.

In August 2006, Air Berlin acquired German domestic airline dba. Flight operations at dba were continued as a fully owned subsidiary of Air Berlin until 14 November 2008, when the dba brand was discontinued due to staff strikes (dba staff were subsequently offered positions with Air Berlin).

On 28 November 2006, Air Berlin ordered 60 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and 15 smaller Boeing 737-700 aircraft. The value of the 75 aircraft was 5.1 billion US dollars (based on list prices at the time.) Delivery of the aircraft started in 2007. All of these aircraft were equipped with blended winglets, to improve fuel efficiency.

===2007–2012: Takeovers, expansion and new alliances===
In March 2007, Air Berlin took over German leisure airline LTU, gaining access to the long-haul market and becoming the fourth-largest airline group in Europe in terms of passenger traffic. This deal led to the introduction of Airbus A321 and Airbus A330 aircraft into Air Berlin&#x27;s fleet. On 1 May 2009, the LTU brand was discontinued.

On 7 July 2007, Air Berlin announced an order for 25 Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner long-haul aircraft, with further options and purchase rights. Three additional aircraft of this type were to be leased from International Lease Finance Corporation.

On 21 August 2007, Air Berlin acquired a 49 percent shareholding in Swiss charter airline Belair, the remainder being owned by tour operator Hotelplan. Following the deal, Belair&#x27;s long-haul business was terminated, and the fleet was replaced by Airbus A320 family aircraft operating scheduled flights on behalf of Air Berlin as well as charter flights for Hotelplan. On 20 September 2007, Air Berlin announced it intended to buy its competitor Condor in a deal that envisaged Condor&#x27;s owner, Thomas Cook Group, taking a 30% stake in Air Berlin. However, the rapidly increasing price of jet fuel and other considerations led to the abandonment of the deal in July 2008.

In January 2008 Air Berlin introduced a new logo and corporate design. The logo is a white oval shape on a red background (suggesting an aircraft window) where the letter &quot;a&quot; is a white circle and two white stylised wings. The text &quot;Air Berlin&quot; was in lower case and written as one word. Sometimes the slogan &quot;Your Airline&quot; was featured as part of the logo. In June 2008, CEO Joachim Hunold offended Catalan language speakers, when he claimed in an article included in Air Berlin&#x27;s in-flight magazine that the government of the Balearic Islands was trying to impose the use of Catalan on Air Berlin flights from and to Majorca. He claimed that Air Berlin was an international airline and was not obliged to use Catalan. Hunold went on to criticise the language policy in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, claiming that at the time many children could not speak any Spanish. The Balearic Islands&#x27; president, Francesc Antich, explained that his government had simply sent a letter to encourage airlines operating in the Balearic Islands to include Catalan among the languages used for onboard announcements.

On 18 June of the same year, Air Berlin announced that it would reduce its long-haul services by 13 percent and its domestic services by 10 percent to increase profitability. In September 2008, Air Berlin confirmed merger talks with competitor TUIfly, but added it was speaking with all parties. Air Berlin had, until 2007, been flying many code-share TUI flights. At the end of March 2009, Air Berlin PLC and TUI Travel PLC signed a deal by which their German flight businesses were to operate a long-term strategic alliance. Originally, each company was to take a 19.9% stake in the other and the German cartel authorities were petitioned for approval. After the Bundeskartellamt expressed concerns, the cross-ownership plan was not implemented. Instead, TUI Travel PLC purchased a 9.9% stake in Air Berlin PLC using a capital increase at a subsidiary to do so.

At the end of March 2009, a strategic partnership agreement with TUI Travel was signed, with Air Berlin and its competitor TUIfly purchasing 19.9 percent of the other&#x27;s shares. Following the deal, Air Berlin took over all German domestic TUIfly routes, as well as those to Italy, Croatia and Austria. Also, all of Tuifly&#x27;s Boeing 737-700 aircraft were added to Air Berlin&#x27;s fleet. TUIfly was to abandon all scheduled flights and rely exclusively on the charter business.

In March 2009, ESAS Holding A.S., a Turkish company, bought approximately 15 per cent of the voting shares in Air Berlin. Also in 2009, Air Berlin added Hartmut Mehdorn to the board of directors after his retirement at Deutsche Bahn.

In April 2010 Air Berlin expanded its codeshare arrangements with Russia&#x27;s S7 Airlines. Air Berlin and S7 Airlines had cooperated since October 2008. New services included codeshare flights via Moscow to Irkutsk, Perm and Rostov.

In July 2010, Air Berlin announced an increase in its shareholding in the Austrian airline Niki. Air Berlin indirectly acquired 25.9% of the shares in Niki from Privatstiftung Lauda (private Lauda foundation) and in doing so increased its shareholding in Niki from 24% to 49.9%. In connection with the increase of its shareholding, Air Berlin was to grant the private Lauda foundation a 40.5 million-euro loan. The private foundation had the options to repay the loan in three years with cash or through the transfer of the remaining 50.1% of Niki&#x27;s shares.
In July 2010, it was also announced that Air Berlin would join Oneworld, the global airline alliance. In preparation for joining the alliance, Air Berlin made codeshare agreements with Finnair and American Airlines starting with the 2010/2011 winter schedule. Air Berlin planned to operate an airline hub at Berlin Brandenburg Airport together with its Oneworld partners from the originally planned opening in 2012. The delayed opening of the new airport made it difficult to operate a hub, as the infrastructure at Tegel was not designed for a hub.

Air Berlin founded Follow Me Entertainment GmbH in September 2010 as a joint venture with kick-media ag. This joint-venture company markets image and sound media, books, games as well as events, concerts, tournaments and sponsoring.

On 1 April 2011 Air Berlin completed the integration of LTU. All Air Berlin Group technical services were consolidated in a new company called airberlin technik GmbH. It also added new routes, more frequent flights and additional long-haul flights from Düsseldorf. On 15 June 2011, Air Berlin and British Airways reached a codeshare agreement covering some flights within Europe, starting from 5 July 2011. The agreement applied to flights to over 40 European destinations served by the two airlines. CEO Joachim Hunold resigned from his position on 1 September 2011 and was succeeded by the former CEO of Deutsche Bahn AG, Hartmut Mehdorn, who led the company on an interim basis until January 2013.

In November 2011 Air Berlin and Pegasus Airlines (Turkey&#x27;s largest private airline) launched &quot;Air Berlin Turkey&quot;, aiming at the charter market between Germany and Turkey. Pegasus Airlines is 16.5% owned by ESAS Holding AS. The new airline was absorbed into Pegasus Airlines on 31 March 2013. In the third quarter of 2011, the turnover of the company amounted to 1.4 billion euros, an increase of 11%. However, operating profit decreased by almost 50% to around 97 million euros. As a result, a new bond to raise additional capital was issued. In November 2011 Air Berlin took over the remaining 50.1% stake in NIKI as repayment of a loan and became its sole owner. The brand name was retained and Niki Lauda was given a position on the board of Air Berlin.

Air Berlin announced on 19 December 2011 that Etihad Airways had increased its share of Air Berlin from 2.99% to 29.1%, for a sum of 73 million euros, making Etihad the company&#x27;s largest shareholder. The deal supplied more cash to Air Berlin, and provided Etihad access to Air Berlin&#x27;s European network.

===2012–2015: Restructuring amid continuing losses===

The cooperation of the frequent-flyer programs topbonus and Etihad Guest was announced in March 2012. In June 2012, the collaboration concluded with the bonus programs airberlin business points and Etihad Airways Business Connect for SMBs.

On 20 March 2012, the entry into Oneworld was officially completed. The Oneworld network offered over 800 destinations in 150 countries. At the same time, the airline introduced the Platinum status for its frequent-flyer program topbonus. In May 2012 Air Berlin presented its new fare structure &quot;Your Fare&quot; including &quot;Just Fly&quot;, &quot;Fly Classic&quot; and &quot;FlyFlex&quot; for flights from 1 July 2012. On 11 May 2012 Air Berlin opened its triweekly non-stop flight from Berlin to Los Angeles in the summer schedule, a destination which until then had only been served from Düsseldorf. On 18 December 2012 Air Berlin announced that &quot;topbonus&quot;, its frequent flyer program, would be sold to Etihad Airways; only a 30-percent minority share would be retained. Air Berlin also announced the expansion of the existing codeshare agreement with Etihad Airways on 20 December 2012.

In January 2013, the first Airbus A330-200 was introduced with a new business class which enabled a fully flat position for the first time. On 7 January 2013 Air Berlin appointed Austrian Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, former Chief Strategy and Planning Officer, as the company&#x27;s CEO, replacing Hartmut Mehdorn.

Air Berlin started flights between Berlin and Chicago on 23 March 2013. It cancelled the seasonal non-stop flights to Las Vegas, San Francisco and Vancouver. In March 2013 Air Berlin announced the closure of its seasonal hub for leisure destinations at Nuremberg Airport. Only ten year-round direct routes remained.

On 24 September 2014, Air Berlin cancelled the remaining 15 orders for their Boeing 787s as well as 18 remaining orders for Boeing 737-800s as part of their restructuring programme. In October 2014, the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt denied Air Berlin authorization to operate 34 routes as a codeshare with co-owner Etihad from the 2014/2015 winter schedule as they would contravene the bilateral traffic rights between Germany and the UAE.
Also in October 2014, Air Berlin announced the termination of flights to Palma de Mallorca from both Bremen Airport and Dortmund Airport, therefore withdrawing entirely from these two German airports.

Air Berlin announced a net loss for 2014 of €376m (€316m loss in 2013). The airline&#x27;s revenues in 2014 stagnated at €4.16 billion.

In September 2015, Air Berlin phased out the last Boeing 737-700s owned by the company. The remaining aircraft of this type would operate on a wet lease basis from TUIfly until 2019. All Boeing 737-800s were to be phased out by 2016 as Air Berlin plans to focus their short- and medium-haul fleet on the Airbus A320 family to cut costs. In November 2015, Air Berlin announced the closure of its Palma de Mallorca Airport hub by ceasing all of the hub&#x27;s seven Spanish domestic routes by 3 April 2016. Some days earlier, the airline announced plans to add flights from Düsseldorf to Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, San Francisco and Havana by spring 2016. However, the planned route to Dallas/Fort Worth was cancelled a few weeks later due to low demand. On 30 December 2015, the administrative court in Braunschweig ruled in favour of the German civil aviation authority (the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt) and against Air Berlin regarding some of their codeshare operations with Etihad Airways. The shared sale and advertising of 31 out of 83 routes which were marketed by both were declared illegal and ordered stopped by 15 January 2016 as they were not covered by the bilateral air-traffic agreement between Germany and the UAE. The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt had allowed these flights until a definite legal ruling was made.

===2016–2017: Restructuring efforts===
In April 2016, Air Berlin announced a record loss of €446 million for 2015; the airline&#x27;s revenues had decreased to €4.08 billion. Amongst the reasons considered for Air Berlin&#x27;s poor performance were: crippling debt of over €800m; unclear and rapid strategy changes on routes and advertising; several CEOs over recent years; a five-year-plus delay to the new hub Berlin Brandenburg Airport; failed negotiations to profit from lower fuel prices and the overall harsh competition in the airline industry. In July 2016, Air Berlin confirmed that it no longer owned any of the aircraft it operates, having sold and leased back the last of the aircraft it had previously owned. A few weeks later it was reported that Air Berlin and Etihad Airways were in talks with Lufthansa regarding the latter&#x27;s acquisition of some of Air Berlin&#x27;s routes outside of the Berlin and Düsseldorf hubs as well as some staff and aircraft leases. Also in July 2016, Air Berlin announced the increase of flights to the United States from 55 to 78 nonstops per week for 2017. Besides some frequency increases, Los Angeles and San Francisco were to be served from Berlin as well as by the then existing Düsseldorf routes. And a new Düsseldorf-Orlando route was announced. A few days later, the airline announced the introduction of a business class on its short- and medium-haul flights.

In December 2016, Air Berlin announced Stefan Pichler&#x27;s departure after serving two years as CEO and replacement by former head of Germanwings, Thomas Winkelmann on 1 February.

====The &quot;new Air Berlin&quot; project====
On 28 September 2016, Air Berlin announced &quot;The new airberlin&quot;, a restructuring project including the reduction of its destinations from around 140 to 70, the focus on the Berlin and Düsseldorf hubs and on the smaller bases in Stuttgart and Munich, the closure of six other bases, the targeting of business travellers, focus on domestic German flights and on flights to Italy, Scandinavia and eastern Europe, the expansion of its long-haul network, and the loss of up to 1,200 jobs.

Air Berlin, including its subsidiaries Belair and Niki, planned to cut 40 of its fleet of 118 narrowbody jets, leaving Air Berlin with its own fleet of 75 aircraft. The new fleet would be 17 Airbus A330-200 for long-haul operations and 40 Airbus A320 family aircraft and 18 Bombardier Q400 aircraft for European routes. A separate, tourist-destination-oriented unit with 35 aircraft was to be formed, perhaps operating with a partner (TUIfly was the assumed partner as they already operate several aircraft for Air Berlin) – or sold altogether. Plans to wet lease the remaining aircraft were realised with the December 2016 announcement that 38 Airbus A319/A320 aircraft would be wet leased to Lufthansa Group&#x27;s Eurowings (33 aircraft) and Austrian Airlines (five), effective February 2017 for a period of six years.

In October 2016, Air Berlin announced plans to close four of its seven &quot;airberlin Technik&quot; maintenance facilities and lay off 500 of their staff. On 5 December 2016, Air Berlin announced plans to sell its entire 49-percent stake in its Austrian subsidiary Niki to its own minority owner, Etihad Airways. It was also announced that Niki will take over several routes to southern European, north African and Turkish leisure destinations from Air Berlin as part of the new joint-venture. Also in December 2016, Air Berlin announced the transfer of its entire fleet of 21 A321-200s to Niki and Niki&#x27;s transfer of all its 5 A319-100s and 13 A320-200s to Air Berlin. Air Berlin would discontinue its wet lease with TUIfly.

In January 2017, Air Berlin announced that for summer 2017, most leisure routes were to be either transferred to Niki or cancelled altogether and that some domestic and European city routes were to be dropped, leaving little more than the Berlin-Tegel and Düsseldorf hub operations. On 28 April 2017, a loss of € −781.9 million was announced for 2016, from a revenue of €3.79 billion. Also in late April 2017, Air Berlin confirmed the creation of &quot;Air Berlin Aeronautics GmbH&quot;, a new subsidiary which was to have its own operational licence (AOC) to take over the wet lease operations handled by Air Berlin on behalf of Eurowings and Austrian Airlines. Therefore, the &quot;actual&quot; Air Berlin would focus on operations under its own brand name. In May 2017, Air Berlin announced it would buy Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter entirely, in which it had a controlling stake since 2009.

====Bankruptcy====
After Etihad stopped financial support, Air Berlin entered insolvency procedures on 15 August 2017. On 9 October 2017, Air Berlin told its staff that it would cease all remaining operations under its own &quot;AB&quot; flight numbers due to its negative financial outlook and bankruptcy proceedings. On 12 October 2017, Lufthansa agreed to buy 81 aircraft and employ 3,000 Air Berlin employees for €210 million, taking over the subsidiaries Niki and Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter with a total of 1700 employees. On 24 October 2017, the Berliner &quot;Zeitfracht Group&quot; confirmed it would take over the &quot;Leisure Cargo&quot; Düsseldorf company and its 60 employees. The creditors&#x27; committee approved a corresponding submission. Leisure Cargo conveys freight space on passenger flights. On 27 October 2017, it was announced that a &#x27;consortium&#x27; of maintenance, repair, and operations provider &quot;Nayak Aircraft Services GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; and Berliner &quot;Zeitfracht Group&quot; would purchase airberlin Technik, keeping over 300 employees.

The final long-haul flight, from Miami to Düsseldorf, was operated on 15 October 2017. On 27 October 2017, Air Berlin&#x27;s final flight was operated by Airbus A320 D-ABNW. It departed from Munich at 21:36 and landed at Berlin Tegel at 22:45. On 28 October 2017, it was announced that EasyJet would absorb 1,000 employees and lease 25 Airbus A320 aircraft for flights from Berlin Tegel for €40 million.

Just over six years after filing for bankruptcy and ceasing all flight operations, Air Berlin&#x27;s trademark rights were sold to Marcos Rossello, noting that he does not plan on mixing Air Berlin into a new branding for his own existing Sundair.

==Corporate affairs==
===Head office===

The airline was headquartered at the Airport Bureau Center in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Berlin.

===Flight school===
Air Berlin trained its own pilots since 2007 in a joint venture with the TFC Käufer flight school. Commercial pilot training lasted around 24 months. The Air Berlin flight school was the first flight school in Germany to be awarded a training licence by the German Department of Aviation for the new Multi-Crew Pilot Licence concept in February 2009.

===Technical services===
Air Berlin had its own maintenance and overhaul branch, &quot;airberlin technik&quot; with facilities in Berlin, Düsseldorf, Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Nuremberg, which employed 1300 staff as of October 2016. The technical branch was a certified EASA Part-145 maintenance organization with approximately 1200 employees providing services to both Air Berlin group aircraft and customers throughout Europe. airberlin technik was recognized and approved by various National Airworthiness Authorities such as USA FAA-145, Canadian CAA-145, Aruba EASA-145, Federal Aviation Authority of Russia, GCAA, United Arab Emirates. In October 2016, Air Berlin announced it would close the technical bases in Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Nuremberg while laying off 500 staff due to restructuring measures.

===Ownership===
Air Berlin PLC shares were publicly traded on Xetra and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the regulated market. Trading in the regulated unofficial market occurred at the exchanges in Berlin, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart. Since December 2011, Etihad Airways was the largest shareholder in Air Berlin. As of December 2015, the major shareholders (over 5%) were:

===Historic fleet===
During its 40 years of operation, Air Berlin operated the following aircraft types:

==Services==

===Aircraft cabins===

====Long-haul flights====
Air Berlin long-haul aircraft featured business and economy class sections. At the beginning of 2012, Air Berlin started the renewal of its long-haul cabin, equipping both economy class and business class with new seats and a new in-flight entertainment system. Fully automatic seats that could tilt up to 170 degrees were provided in business class, along with an anti-thrombosis edition and an adjustable headrest, and more legroom and a narrower seat back in economy class. All seats have an 8.9-inch monitor with a touch screen and offer movies, series, music, audiobooks and games. In January 2013 the airline again presented a new business class which replaced the one introduced a year earlier. The new business class had single seats, offering travellers even more privacy. The new seats had a full-flat function, a massage function, and featured a 15-inch monitor.

====Short- and medium-haul flights====
Business class was not offered on its short- and medium-haul flights until Air Berlin announced its introduction in August 2016. All short- and medium-haul aircraft began to feature business class in row 1 with expanded services including an empty middle seat.

===Passenger services===

In contrast to European pure low-cost carriers, Air Berlin offered free in-flight snacks and drinks until September 2016. Newspapers and magazines were available on domestic German flights. Full hot meals were complimentary on long-haul flights. On all Air Berlin routes with a flight time of 60 minutes or longer, gourmet meals were offered, which were, according to the airline, created by chefs at &quot;Sansibar&quot;, a famous restaurant on the island of Sylt. The airline also offered in-flight entertainment, assigned seating and guaranteed flight connections.
Air Berlin&#x27;s basic fares were nonrefundable and not changeable, so unused flights were a complete loss for the purchaser.

===Frequent flyer program===
Air Berlin&#x27;s frequent flyer program was called &quot;topbonus&quot;. Points, known as miles, could be collected on flights operated by Air Berlin, Niki, Oneworld airline partners, and selected other airlines. Accrued miles could be redeemed for award flights, or for an upgrade to business class. In addition to the entry-level &quot;topbonus Card Classic&quot; there were cards with Silver, Gold, and Platinum status, corresponding to Oneworld Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald statuses. A Service Card and a Credit Card, for which a charge was made, were also available. Etihad Airways purchased a 70% stake in topbonus for €184 million in 2012. Following the insolvency of Air Berlin, topbonus also filed for insolvency on 25 August 2017.

* It is either of the two sets of three stumps and two bails at each end of the pitch. The fielding team&#x27;s players can hit the wicket with the ball in a number of ways to get a batter out. 
** The wicket is guarded by a batter who, with their bat (and sometimes with their pads, but see the laws on LBW, leg before wicket), attempts to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket (if it does, he is bowled out) and to score runs where possible. 
* Through metonymic usage, the dismissal of a batter is known as the &quot;taking of a wicket&quot;,
* The cricket pitch itself is sometimes referred to as &quot;the wicket&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;In the sport of croquet, wooden or plastic balls are hit with a mallet through hoops embedded in a grass playing court. A croquet hoop is commonly referred to as a wicket in North American English. (Note: the remainder of this page is about the wicket in cricket, not in croquet.)

==History==
The origin of the word is from wicket gate, a small gate. Originally, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate, much like the wicket used in the North American game of wicket. The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775, after Lumpy Stevens bowled three successive deliveries to John Small that went straight through the two stumps rather than hitting them.

==Stumps and bails==

The size and shape of the wicket has changed several times during the last 300 years; its dimensions and placing is now determined by Law 8 in the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;, thus:

* Law 8: The wickets. The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are tall. The stumps are placed along the batting crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so they are wide. Two wooden bails are placed in shallow grooves on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than above the stumps, and must, for cricket, be long.

There are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (e.g., if it is windy they might fall off by themselves). Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix D to the laws.

===Putting down a wicket===

The wicket can be thought of as a target for the fielding team, as the bowler and fielders can dismiss a batter by hitting the wicket with the ball, in certain circumstances, and can prevent run-scoring by threatening to do so.

For a batter to be dismissed by being bowled, run out, stumped or hit wicket, their wicket needs to be put down. For run out and stumped, this has to be when neither batter is in the ground of the wicket. This generally occurs when a fielder throws the ball at the wicket, or hits it with ball in hand. 

What &#x27;putting down a wicket&#x27; means is defined by Law 29. A wicket is put down if:

* A bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps
* A stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker&#x27;s bat, the striker&#x27;s person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a fielder (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). 
* A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance. 
The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.

Special situations:

*If one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any stump out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batter.
*If both bails are off, a fielder must strike or pull any stump out of the ground with the ball, or pull it out of the ground with a hand or arm, provided that the ball is held in the hand(s) so used, or in the hand of the arm so used.

If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker&#x27;s bat, person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball.

===Modern innovations===

As per the ICC Playing Conditions, when using the LED wickets, &quot;the moment at which the wicket has been put down [...] shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are illuminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps.&quot; The manufacturer is reviewing the LED wicket&#x27;s performance after a number of international cricketers criticized the Zing bails during the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
==Dismissal of a batter==
The dismissal of a batter is known as the &quot;taking of a wicket&quot;. The batter is said to have &quot;lost their wicket&quot;, the batting side is said to have &quot;lost a wicket&quot;, the fielding side to have &quot;taken a wicket&quot;, and the bowler is also said to have &quot;taken their&quot; (i.e. the batter&#x27;s) &quot;wicket&quot;, if the dismissal is one of the types for which the bowler receives credit. This language is used even if the dismissal did not actually involve the stumps and bails in any way (for example, a catch). The other four of the five most common methods of dismissal (bowled, LBW, run out, and stumped) involve the stumps and bails being put down (in the case of LBW, theoretically).

The word &quot;wicket&quot; has this meaning in the following contexts:

===Scoring===
A team&#x27;s score is described in terms of the total number of runs scored and the total number of wickets lost.

===Bowling analyses===
The number of wickets taken is a primary measure of an individual bowler&#x27;s ability, and a key part of a bowling analysis.

===Batting partnerships===
The sequence of time over which two particular batters bat together, a partnership, is referred to as a specifically numbered wicket when discriminating it from other partnerships in the innings. This can be thought of as saying &quot;this was the number of runs scored while this team had lost [&quot;n&quot;-1] wickets and had yet to lose their &quot;n&quot;th wicket.&quot;
*The first wicket partnership is from the start of the innings until the team loses its first wicket, i.e. one of the first two batters is dismissed.
* The second wicket partnership is from when the third batter starts batting until the team loses its second wicket, i.e. the time from when they have lost one wicket until the time they have lost a second wicket, which happens when a second batter is dismissed.
* etc...
* The tenth wicket or last wicket partnership is from when the eleventh (last) batter starts batting until the team loses its tenth (last) wicket, i.e. a tenth (last) batter is dismissed.

===Winning by number of wickets===
A team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. For example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batters dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets (as a team&#x27;s innings ends when ten batters are dismissed).

==The pitch==
The word &quot;wicket&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket pitch itself. According to the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers.
The term &quot;sticky wicket&quot; refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp, typically due to rain or high humidity. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult. The full phrase is thought to have originally been &quot;to bat on a sticky wicket.&quot; Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game (i.e. up to Test match level) until the late 1950s.

==In other sports==
Even though it is a cricket term, the arches used in croquet and roque are sometimes referred to as &quot;wickets&quot;, especially in American English. These arches descend from the ancestral game of ground billiards (which may also be related to cricket), and were formerly called the &quot;hoop&quot;, &quot;arch&quot; or &quot;port&quot;. The port remained a prominent feature of indoor table billiards until well into the 18th century.

In baseball, the strike zone is similar to the wicket, in that a batter who fails to hit a ball that is going towards the strike zone is at risk of being out.

<doc id="463708" wikidata="Q739728" url="?curid=463708" title="China Youth Daily">
<text>The China Youth Daily () has been the newspaper of the Communist Youth League of China since 1951. It has occasionally published articles critical of the Chinese government.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the &quot;China Youth Daily&quot; to be &quot;State Controlled Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==Background==
The &quot;China Youth Daily&quot; was established in 1951, six years before the Chinese Socialist Youth League decided to change its name to the Communist Youth League of China (CYL).

The Pan Xiao debate (1980) refers to a published letter sent by a young female reader titled &quot;Why is the life path getting narrower and narrower&quot; which generated 60 thousand response letters in 7 months. It provoked discussion about the meaning of life in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution.

The newspaper had a circulation of 800,000 in 2006&quot;. Freezing Point&quot; (冰点 pinyin: Bing diǎn), a four-page weekly supplement of China Youth Daily was temporarily shut down by the Chinese government in early 2006, due to an anti-censorship letter posted by columnist Li Datong. According to &quot;The&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot;, government censors accused the section of &quot;&#x27;viciously attacking the socialist system&#x27; and condemned a recent article in it that criticized the history textbooks used in Chinese middle schools.&quot; Pressure from retired high-level party officials and senior scholars forced the government to allow publication again, but without its former editor and top investigative reporter, according to &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot;.

In March 2018, &quot;China Youth Daily&quot; won the Third National Top 100 Publications in China.

<doc id="463709" wikidata="Q651256" url="?curid=463709" title="Issachar">
<text>Issachar () was, according to the Book of Genesis, the fifth of the six sons of Jacob and Leah (Jacob&#x27;s ninth son), and the founder of the Israelite Tribe of Issachar. However, some Biblical scholars view this as an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe to others in the Israelite confederation.

==Name==
Two different etymologies for the name of &quot;Issachar&quot; have been proposed based on the text of the Torah, which some textual scholars attribute to different sources—one to the Yahwist and the other to the Elohist. The first derives it from &quot;ish sakar&quot;, meaning &quot;man of hire&quot;, in reference to Leah&#x27;s hire of Jacob&#x27;s sexual favours for the price of some mandrakes. The second derives it from &quot;yesh sakar&quot;, meaning &quot;there is a reward&quot;, in reference to Leah&#x27;s opinion that the birth of Issachar was a divine reward for giving her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob as a concubine. Scholars suspect the former explanation to be the more likely name for a tribe, though some scholars have proposed a third etymology—that it derives from &quot;ish Sokar&quot;, meaning &quot;man of Sokar&quot;, in reference to the tribe&#x27;s perhaps originally worshipping Sokar, an Egyptian deity.

==Historical theories==
In the Biblical account, Leah&#x27;s status as the first wife of Jacob is regarded by biblical scholars as indicating that the authors saw the tribe of Issachar as being one of the original Israelite groups; however, this may have been the result of a scribal error, as the names of &quot;Issachar&quot; and &quot;Naphtali&quot; appear to have changed places elsewhere in the text, and the birth narrative of Issachar and Naphtali is regarded by textual scholars as having been spliced together from its sources in a manner which has highly corrupted the narrative. A number of scholars think that the tribe of Issachar actually originated as the Shekelesh group of Sea Peoples - the name &quot;Shekelesh&quot; can be decomposed as &quot;men of the Shekel&quot; in Hebrew, a meaning synonymous with &quot;man of hire&quot; (&quot;ish sakar&quot;); scholars believe that the memory of such non-Israelite origin would have led to the Torah&#x27;s authors having given Issachar a &quot;handmaiden&quot; as a matriarch.

==Rabbinical interpretations==
In classical rabbinical literature, it is stated that Issachar was born on the fourth of Av, and lived 122 years. According to the midrashic Book of Jasher, Issachar married &quot;Aridah&quot;, the younger daughter of Jobab, a son of Joktan; the Torah states that Issachar had four sons, who were born in Canaan and migrated with him to Egypt, with their descendants remaining there until the Exodus. The midrashic Book of Jasher portrays Issachar as somewhat pragmatic, due to his strong effort in being more learned, less involved with other matters which led him to such actions like taking a feeble part in military campaigns involving his brothers, and generally residing in strongly fortified cities and, depending on his brother Zebulun&#x27;s financial support in return for a share in the spiritual reward he gains.

The Talmud argues that Issachar&#x27;s description in the Blessing of Jacob - &quot;Issachar is a strong ass lying down between two burdens: and he saw that settled life was good, and the land was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute&quot; - is a reference to the religious scholarship of the tribe of Issachar, though scholars feel that it may more simply be a literal interpretation of Issachar&#x27;s name.

==In Islam==
Some Muslim genealogists link Shuayb to Abraham through both Sarah and Keturah by making Shuayb&#x27;s genealogy to be Shuayb b. Isaachar b. Midian b. Abraham.

== Tomb ==
A Samaritan tradition recorded in the late 19th century considered Neby Hazkil near Rameh to be the burial place of Issachar.

<doc id="463715" wikidata="Q2403422" url="?curid=463715" title="Carolyn Bennett">
<text>Carolyn Ann Bennett (born December 20, 1950) is a Canadian ambassador and retired politician. A member of the Liberal Party, she represented Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s in the House of Commons from 1997 to 2024, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Paul Martin and Justin Trudeau. She was the minister of State for Public Health from 2003 to 2006, the minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations from 2015 to 2021 and the minister of Mental Health and Addictions from 2021 to 2023. In 2024, she became the Ambassador of Canada to the Kingdom of Denmark. Prior to entering politics, Bennett worked as a family physician for 20 years.

== Early life, education and career ==
Carolyn Ann Bennett was born in Toronto on December 20, 1950. She attended Havergal College. She graduated with a degree in medicine from the University of Toronto in 1974 and received her certification in family medicine in 1976. In 2004, she was awarded an honorary fellowship from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada for her contributions to medicine, especially women&#x27;s health.

=== Professional career ===
Bennett was a family physician for 20 years before entering politics.

Bennett worked as a family physician at Wellesley Hospital and Women&#x27;s College Hospital in Toronto from 1977 to 1997 and was a founding partner in Bedford Medical Associates. She was also president of the medical staff association of Women&#x27;s College Hospital and has a clinical adjunct appointment as an assistant professor in the department of family and community medicine at the University of Toronto. Bennett served on the boards of Havergal College, Women&#x27;s College Hospital, the Ontario Medical Association, and the Medico-Legal Society of Toronto.

Bennett co-authored &quot;Kill or Cure? How Canadians Can Remake their Health Care System&quot; with Rick Archbold, published in October 2000.

== Political career ==
Bennett ran for public office in the 1995 Ontario provincial election as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party. Running in the riding of St. Andrew—St. Patrick, she lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Isabel Bassett by about 3,500 votes.

Bennett was more successful in the 1997 federal election, defeating her closest opponent in St. Paul&#x27;s Peter Atkins by almost 15,000 votes. She was re-elected by increased margins in the elections of 2000 and 2004.

On December 12, 2003, after Paul Martin became Prime Minister, he appointed Bennett as his Minister of State for Public Health. In her two years as Minister, she set up the Public Health Agency of Canada, appointed the first chief public health officer for Canada, and established the Public Health Network.

She was chair of the Canada-Israel Friendship Group from 1999 to 2003 and is a member of Liberal Parliamentarians for Israel.

In the 2006 election, Bennett defeated two main challengers who were both touted as star candidates, Peter Kent of the Conservatives and Paul Summerville of the New Democratic Party. Bennett was re-elected, but lost her cabinet position as the Liberals were defeated. She became only the third opposition MP in the history of St. Paul&#x27;s. The riding had once been a noted bellwether, but swung heavily to the Liberals along with most other central Toronto ridings.

She announced on April 24, 2006 that she would pursue the leadership of the party. On September 15, 2006, she withdrew from the leadership race and threw her support behind former Ontario Premier Bob Rae.

In the 39th Parliament, Bennett was the Official Opposition critic for social development, social economy, seniors, persons with disabilities, and public health.

She was re-elected in 2008. In the 40th Parliament, Bennett was the Official Opposition critic for health.

She was re-elected in 2011. In the 41st Parliament, Bennett was the Liberal critic for Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development, and the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency.

On November 4, 2015, Bennett was appointed the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, which was later renamed the position of Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations. She was re-elected in 2019.

On June 24, 2021, Bennett was forced to apologize to Jody Wilson-Raybould for her response to a tweet by Wilson-Raybould concerning Justin Trudeau and his government&#x27;s response to the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan. Referencing her tweet, Bennett texted Wilson-Raybould the single-word message &quot;Pension?&quot;. Wilson-Raybould called it &quot;racist and misogynistic&quot;, posting a screenshot of the message on Twitter. 

On October 26, 2021, Bennett was sworn in as Canada&#x27;s first ever Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, with Marc Miller taking her place as Minister for Crown-Indigenous Relations. 

On July 24, 2023, Bennett announced she would not be running in the next general election, and in the Cabinet shuffle two days later, she was demoted from her position as Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. She resigned her seat on January 16, 2024, the same day it was reported she would be appointed Canada&#x27;s Ambassador to Denmark. The federal by-election to replace her was held on June 24, 2024. The riding was succeeded by Conservative Party candidate Don Stewart.

== Personal life ==
She is married to Canadian film producer Peter O&#x27;Brian. They have two sons.

== Awards ==
* Royal Life Saving Society Service Cross (1986)
* EVE Award for Contributing to the Advancement of Women in Politics (2002)

<doc id="463721" wikidata="Q899033" url="?curid=463721" title="Space group">
<text>In mathematics, physics and chemistry, a space group is the symmetry group of a repeating pattern in space, usually in three dimensions. The elements of a space group (its symmetry operations) are the rigid transformations of the pattern that leave it unchanged. In three dimensions, space groups are classified into 219 distinct types, or 230 types if chiral copies are considered distinct. Space groups are discrete cocompact groups of isometries of an oriented Euclidean space in any number of dimensions. In dimensions other than 3, they are sometimes called [[#In_other_dimensions|Bieberbach groups]].

In crystallography, space groups are also called the crystallographic or [[Evgraf Fedorov|Fedorov]] groups, and represent a description of the symmetry of the crystal. A definitive source regarding 3-dimensional space groups is the &quot;International Tables for Crystallography&quot; .

==History==
Space groups in 2 dimensions are the 17 wallpaper groups which have been known for several centuries, though the proof that the list was complete was only given in 1891, after the much more difficult classification of space groups had largely been completed.

In 1879 the German mathematician Leonhard Sohncke listed the 65 space groups (called Sohncke groups) whose elements preserve the chirality. More accurately, he listed 66 groups, but both the Russian mathematician and crystallographer Evgraf Fedorov and the German mathematician Arthur Moritz Schoenflies noticed that two of them were really the same. The space groups in three dimensions were first enumerated in 1891 by Fedorov (whose list had two omissions (I3d and Fdd2) and one duplication (Fmm2)), and shortly afterwards in 1891 were independently enumerated by Schönflies (whose list had four omissions (I3d, Pc, Cc, ?) and one duplication (P21m)). The correct list of 230 space groups was found by 1892 during correspondence between Fedorov and Schönflies. later enumerated the groups with a different method, but omitted four groups (Fdd2, I2d, P21d, and P21c) even though he already had the correct list of 230 groups from Fedorov and Schönflies; the common claim that Barlow was unaware of their work is incorrect. describes the history of the discovery of the space groups in detail.

==Elements==
The space groups in three dimensions are made from combinations of the 32 crystallographic point groups with the 14 Bravais lattices, each of the latter belonging to one of 7 lattice systems. What this means is that the action of any element of a given space group can be expressed as the action of an element of the appropriate point group followed optionally by a translation. A space group is thus some combination of the translational symmetry of a unit cell (including lattice centering), the point group symmetry operations of reflection, rotation and improper rotation (also called rotoinversion), and the screw axis and glide plane symmetry operations. The combination of all these symmetry operations results in a total of 230 different space groups describing all possible crystal symmetries.

The number of replicates of the asymmetric unit in a unit cell is thus the number of lattice points in the cell times the order of the point group. This ranges from 1 in the case of space group P1 to 192 for a space group like Fmm, the NaCl structure.

===Elements fixing a point===
The elements of the space group fixing a point of space are the identity element, reflections, rotations and improper rotations, including inversion points.

===Translations===
The translations form a normal abelian subgroup of rank 3, called the Bravais lattice (so named after French physicist Auguste Bravais). There are 14 possible types of Bravais lattice. The quotient of the space group by the Bravais lattice is a finite group which is one of the 32 possible point groups.

===Glide planes===
A glide plane is a reflection in a plane, followed by a translation parallel with that plane. This is noted by formula_1, formula_2, or formula_3, depending on which axis the glide is along. There is also the formula_4 glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the formula_5 glide, which is a fourth of the way along either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell. The latter is called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure. In 17 space groups, due to the centering of the cell, the glides occur in two perpendicular directions simultaneously, &quot;i.e.&quot; the same glide plane can be called &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot; or &quot;c&quot;. For example, group Abm2 could be also called Acm2, group Ccca could be called Cccb. In 1992, it was suggested to use symbol &quot;e&quot; for such planes. The symbols for five space groups have been modified:
===Screw axes===
A screw axis is a rotation about an axis, followed by a translation along the direction of the axis. These are noted by a number, &quot;n&quot;, to describe the degree of rotation, where the number is how many operations must be applied to complete a full rotation (e.g., 3 would mean a rotation one third of the way around the axis each time). The degree of translation is then added as a subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of the parallel lattice vector. So, 21 is a twofold rotation followed by a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector.

=== General formula ===
The general formula for the action of an element of a space group is

: &quot;y&quot; = &quot;M&quot;.&quot;x&quot; + &quot;D&quot;

where &quot;M&quot; is its matrix, &quot;D&quot; is its vector, and where the element transforms point &quot;x&quot; into point &quot;y&quot;. In general, &quot;D&quot; = &quot;D&quot; (lattice) + , where is a unique function of &quot;M&quot; that is zero for &quot;M&quot; being the identity. The matrices &quot;M&quot; form a point group that is a basis of the space group; the lattice must be symmetric under that point group, but the crystal structure itself may not be symmetric under that point group as applied to any particular point (that is, without a translation). For example, the diamond cubic structure does not have any point where the cubic point group applies.

The lattice dimension can be less than the overall dimension, resulting in a &quot;subperiodic&quot; space group. For (overall dimension, lattice dimension):
* (1,1): One-dimensional line groups
* (2,1): Two-dimensional line groups: frieze groups
* (2,2): Wallpaper groups
* (3,1): Three-dimensional line groups; with the 3D crystallographic point groups, the rod groups
* (3,2): Layer groups
* (3,3): The space groups discussed in this article

===Chirality===
The 65 &quot;Sohncke&quot; space groups, not containing any mirrors, inversion points, improper rotations or glide planes, yield chiral crystals, not identical to their mirror image; whereas space groups that do include at least one of those give achiral crystals. Achiral molecules sometimes form chiral crystals, but chiral molecules always form chiral crystals, in one of the space groups that permit this.

Among the 65 Sohncke groups are 22 that come in 11 enantiomorphic pairs.

===Combinations===
Only certain combinations of symmetry elements are possible in a space group. Translations are always present, and the space group P1 has only translations and the identity element. The presence of mirrors implies glide planes as well, and the presence of rotation axes implies screw axes as well, but the converses are not true. An inversion and a mirror implies two-fold screw axes, and so on.

==Notation==

There are at least ten methods of naming space groups. Some of these methods can assign several different names to the same space group, so altogether there are many thousands of different names.

; Number: The International Union of Crystallography publishes tables of all space group types, and assigns each a unique number from 1 to 230. The numbering is arbitrary, except that groups with the same crystal system or point group are given consecutive numbers.
; Hall notation
: Space group notation with an explicit origin. Rotation, translation and axis-direction symbols are clearly separated and inversion centers are explicitly defined. The construction and format of the notation make it particularly suited to computer generation of symmetry information. For example, group number 3 has three Hall symbols: P 2y (P 1 2 1), P 2 (P 1 1 2), P 2x (P 2 1 1).
; Schönflies notation: The space groups with given point group are numbered by 1, 2, 3, ... (in the same order as their international number) and this number is added as a superscript to the Schönflies symbol for the point group. For example, groups numbers 3 to 5 whose point group is &quot;C&quot;2 have Schönflies symbols &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;.

==Classification systems==
There are (at least) 10 different ways to classify space groups into classes. The relations between some of these are described in the following table. Each classification system is a refinement of the ones below it. To understand an explanation given here it may be necessary to understand the next one down.

 gave another classification of the space groups, called a fibrifold notation, according to the fibrifold structures on the corresponding orbifold. They divided the 219 affine space groups into reducible and irreducible groups. The reducible groups fall into 17 classes corresponding to the 17 wallpaper groups, and the remaining 35 irreducible groups are the same as the cubic groups and are classified separately.

==In other dimensions==

===Bieberbach&#x27;s theorems===
In &quot;n&quot; dimensions, an affine space group, or Bieberbach group, is a discrete subgroup of isometries of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space with a compact fundamental domain. proved that the subgroup of translations of any such group contains &quot;n&quot; linearly independent translations, and is a free abelian subgroup of finite index, and is also the unique maximal normal abelian subgroup. He also showed that in any dimension &quot;n&quot; there are only a finite number of possibilities for the isomorphism class of the underlying group of a space group, and moreover the action of the group on Euclidean space is unique up to conjugation by affine transformations. This answers part of Hilbert&#x27;s eighteenth problem. showed that conversely any group that is the extension of Z&quot;n&quot; by a finite group acting faithfully is an affine space group. Combining these results shows that classifying space groups in &quot;n&quot; dimensions up to conjugation by affine transformations is essentially the same as classifying isomorphism classes for groups that are extensions of Z&quot;n&quot; by a finite group acting faithfully.

It is essential in Bieberbach&#x27;s theorems to assume that the group acts as isometries; the theorems do not generalize to discrete cocompact groups of affine transformations of Euclidean space. A counter-example is given by the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group of the integers acting by translations on the Heisenberg group of the reals, identified with 3-dimensional Euclidean space. This is a discrete cocompact group of affine transformations of space, but does not contain a subgroup Z3.

===Classification in small dimensions===
This table gives the number of space group types in small dimensions, including the numbers of various classes of space group. The numbers of enantiomorphic pairs are given in parentheses.

===Magnetic groups and time reversal===
In addition to crystallographic space groups there are also magnetic space groups (also called two-color (black and white) crystallographic groups or Shubnikov groups). These symmetries contain an element known as time reversal. They treat time as an additional dimension, and the group elements can include time reversal as reflection in it. They are of importance in magnetic structures that contain ordered unpaired spins, i.e. ferro-, ferri- or antiferromagnetic structures as studied by neutron diffraction. The time reversal element flips a magnetic spin while leaving all other structure the same and it can be combined with a number of other symmetry elements. Including time reversal there are 1651 magnetic space groups in 3D . It has also been possible to construct magnetic versions for other overall and lattice dimensions (Daniel Litvin&#x27;s papers, , ). Frieze groups are magnetic 1D line groups and layer groups are magnetic wallpaper groups, and the axial 3D point groups are magnetic 2D point groups. Number of original and magnetic groups by (overall, lattice) dimension:

==Table of space groups in 2 dimensions (wallpaper groups)==

Table of the wallpaper groups using the classification of the 2-dimensional space groups:

For each geometric class, the possible arithmetic classes are
* None: no reflection lines
* Along: reflection lines along lattice directions
* Between: reflection lines halfway in between lattice directions
* Both: reflection lines both along and between lattice directions

==Table of space groups in 3 dimensions==


Note: An &quot;e&quot; plane is a double glide plane, one having glides in two different directions. They are found in seven orthorhombic, five tetragonal and five cubic space groups, all with centered lattice. The use of the symbol &quot;e&quot; became official with .

The lattice system can be found as follows. If the crystal system is not trigonal then the lattice system is of the same type. If the crystal system is trigonal, then the lattice system is hexagonal unless the space group is one of the seven in the rhombohedral lattice system consisting of the 7 trigonal space groups in the table above whose name begins with R. (The term rhombohedral system is also sometimes used as an alternative name for the whole trigonal system.) The hexagonal lattice system is larger than the hexagonal crystal system, and consists of the hexagonal crystal system together with the 18 groups of the trigonal crystal system other than the seven whose names begin with R.

The Bravais lattice of the space group is determined by the lattice system together with the initial letter of its name, which for the non-rhombohedral groups is P, I, F, A or C, standing for the principal, body centered, face centered, A-face centered or C-face centered lattices. There are seven rhombohedral space groups, with initial letter R.

== Derivation of the crystal class from the space group ==
# Leave out the Bravais type
# Convert all symmetry elements with translational components into their respective symmetry elements without translation symmetry (Glide planes are converted into simple mirror planes; Screw axes are converted into simple axes of rotation)
# Axes of rotation, rotoinversion axes and mirror planes remain unchanged.

<text>The [[Mexico City Metro]] is the largest and busiest heavy-rail rapid transit system in Mexico and second in North America, only behind the New York City Subway.

, the system is composed of 12 lines denominated 1 through 9, 12, A and B, totalling of track length and 195 stations. Of all stations, 115 are underground (either in shallow box-tunnels or deep circular tunnels), 54 are at street-level and 26 are elevated.

==Line 1: Observatorio – Pantitlán==


Line 1&#x27;s Chapultepec - Zaragoza section was the first of the system to be opened, on September 4, 1969. The line was brought to its current length on August 22, 1984 with its final extension from Zaragoza to Pantitlán.

Line 1 runs mostly in a shallow box-tunnel just a few meters below the street, except for its initial stretch from Observatorio to Tacubaya, where it starts at street-level and progressively goes down to a deep circular tunnel through Tacubaya, where the box-tunnel begins. Line 1 is served by MP-68, NM-83 and NE-92 trains, built in France, Mexico and Spain in 1968, 1983 and 1992, respectively.

Transfer with other Metro lines is available at Tacubaya (lines 7 &amp; 9), Balderas (line 3), Salto del Agua (Line 8), Pino Suárez (line 2), Candelaria (line 4), San Lázaro (line B) and Pantitlán (lines 5, 9 &amp; A). Transfer to the Metrobús bus rapid transit (BRT) system is available at Tacubaya (line 2), Insurgentes (line 1), Cuauhtémoc (line 3), Balderas (line 3), Pino Suárez (line 4) and San Lázaro (lines 4 &amp; 5).

==Line 2: Cuatro Caminos – Tasqueña==


Line 2 was the second line in the system to open, in 1970. After two expansions, the line has 24 stations, (the most number of stations on a line in the entire metro network), over a total track length of , of which are passenger track. The line has a general northwest–south direction passing through the city center and its color is blue. It starts at the border of the Federal District and the State of Mexico and ends in the city south.

It commutes with line 7 at Tacuba, line 3 at Hidalgo, line 8 at Bellas Artes, line 1 at Pino Suárez, lines 8 and 9 at Chabacano and line 12 at Ermita. At Tasqueña it links with the Mexico City Light Rail to Xochimilco. It used to be served by NC-82 and some NM-83 trains.

Line 2 was the scene of the worst accident in the Mexico City Metro&#x27;s history on October 20, 1975, when a crash occurred between two trains at Viaducto Station. One train was parked at the station picking up passengers when it was hit by another train that did not stop in time. Twenty people were killed and several wounded. After that accident, automatic traffic lights were installed in all the lines.

Thirteen stations run underground while the remaining ten are surface stations. The line is currently served by NM-02 trains built in Mexico in 2004.

==Line 3: Indios Verdes – Universidad==


The first section of line 3 was opened in 1970. It has been expanded five times to comprise 21 stations over a total track length of , of which are passenger track, making it the second longest of the system. The line has a general north–south direction passing through the western end of downtown Mexico City and its color is olive green.

It is built under Insurgentes, Guerrero, Zarco, Balderas, Cuauhtémoc, Universidad, Copilco and Delfín Madrigal avenues. It commutes with line 6 at Deportivo 18 de Marzo, line 5 at La Raza, line B at Guerrero, line 2 at Hidalgo, line 1 at Balderas, line 9 at Centro Médico and line 12 at Zapata.

Most of the stations (17) run underground with the remaining four, including both terminals, being surface stations.


==Line 4: Santa Anita – Martín Carrera==


The first section of line 4 was opened in 1981, and it was expanded once to bring the total extension of this line to ten stations over of track, of which are passenger track. The line has a general north–south direction and is located east of the city center and its color is aqua. It is also the line with the lowest passenger flow, which is why the STC introduced modified 6-wagon trains. In the original blueprint, this line was planned to extend to the north all the way to Ecatepec, Mexico State.

Line 4 is the only one in the system that does not have underground sections. Eight of the ten stations are built on an elevated viaduct and the remaining two are surface stations.

Line 4 connects with line 1 at Candelaria, line 6 at Martín Carrera, line 5 at Consulado, line 8 at Santa Anita, line 9 at Jamaica and line B at Morelos.


==Line 5: Politécnico – Pantitlán==


The first section of line 5 was opened in 1981, and it has been expanded twice to bring the total extension of this line to 13 stations over of track, of which are passenger track. The line has a general north-west to south-east direction relative to the city center and its color is yellow. This line previously had the NM73 trains but due to the introduction of the NM-02 trains in Line 2 now it is served by NC-82 Canadian trains made by Bombardier. Line 5 runs to Mexico City International Airport (Terminal Aérea station).

Line 5 has four underground and nine surface stations. Five stations connect with other metro lines.
==Line 6: El Rosario – Martín Carrera==


Line 6 had its first section inaugurated in 1983. It has been expanded once to bring the total extension of the line to 11 stations over of track, of which are passenger track. This line has a west–east direction running north of the city center and its color is scarlet red.

The line has only one surface station, the El Rosario terminal, while the rest of the line runs underground. Four stations connect with other metro lines. Line 6, like line 4, is also served by customized six-car trains.

==Line 7: El Rosario – Barranca del Muerto==

The first section of line 7 was opened to the public in 1984. It has been expanded three times to bring the total length of the line to 14 stations over of track, of which are passenger track. Line 7 has a north–south direction running west of the city center and its color is orange.

The line has its only surface station in the El Rosario terminal. The rest of the line runs underground, with some sections being located more than 20 m below street level, making it the deepest line in the system at a maximum of 36 meters. Three stations connect with other metro lines.

This line used MP-68 trains and a small number of NM-73, after the rehabilitation of some MP-68. They kept circulating on this line although there is a slightly bigger number of NM-79 and NM-83 in this line. Today there are only retro adapted NM-73 and NM-83 models and some trains from the first model due to the introduction of the NM-02 in the Line 2. Currently the MP-68 trains from Line 9 are being reintroduced.

==Line 8: Garibaldi / Lagunilla – Constitución de 1917==

Line 8 was the next to last route of the network to be opened, on July 20, 1994 by then President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and then regent of the city, Manuel Aguilera Gómez. Construction plans for the line date back to much earlier, but they were put on hold due to significant redevelopment. It has 19 stations over a total track length of , of which are passenger track. Line 8 runs in a general south-east direction, beginning near the city center, and its color is bright green.
The line has 14 underground stations and five surface stations, including the southern terminal Constitución de 1917. Six stations connect line 8 with other metro lines.
According to the Sistema de Transporte Colectivo, the volume of people moved in this line was 117,386,342 persons in 2006.

==Line 9: Tacubaya – Pantitlán==


The first section of line 9 was opened to the public in 1987. It has been expanded once to a length of 12 stations over of track, of which are passenger track. The line was opened to relieve passenger traffic from line 1, to which it runs parallel south of the city center. The color of the line is dark brown.

Line 9 has eight underground stations with the remaining being elevated stations similar to those in line 4, including the terminal Pantitlán. It is the only line in the system in which no section of the track runs at street-level. Additionally, five stations connect with other metro lines. The trains of this line are made up from MP68 trains rehabilitated with fans and intelligent control systems and some NM-79 rolling stock.

Some of the stations were the set for the 1990 film Total Recall.

==Line A: Pantitlán – La Paz==


Line A was the second metro line that extended into the suburbs of Mexico City outside the Mexican Federal District. Opened in its entirety in 1991, it comprises ten stations over of track, of which are passenger track. Line A runs in a general south-east direction, east of the city center, and its color is purple.

Line A has only one underground station, the terminal Pantitlán, while the rest of the line runs at street-level, sometimes going underground between stations. Only one station makes connections with other metro lines.

Until Line 12&#x27;s opening, 21 years later (in 2012), line A was unique within the system in its use of traditional rail traction (steel-wheeled rolling stock) as opposed to pneumatic traction (rubber-tyred rolling stock). Because it was the first line of this type in the metro system, it was called the &quot;Metro Férreo&quot; and sometimes continues to be referred to by that name. The line is served by FM-86 trains, built in Mexico by Concarril in 1986, and FM-95A trains, also built in Mexico (by Bombardier) between 1998 and 1999, which draw electricity through a pantograph. And also FE-07 CAF trains that were made in 2009.

==Line B: Buenavista – Ciudad Azteca==


Line B became the third line to extend into the suburbs of Mexico City, and into the State of Mexico. The first section of the line was opened in 1999 and was expanded once to comprise a total of 21 stations over of track, of which are passenger track. Line B starts north of the city center and runs in a general north-east direction relative to it. Its color is green on silver.

Six stations of line B run under ground, four are elevated and 11 run at street-level. Five stations connect with other metro lines.

All the trains are MP68 modified and equipped with GPS and intelligent control system, the trains in this line were the leftovers from Line 1 that were rehabilitated by Bombardier-Concarril.

==Line 12; &quot;línea del Bicentenario&quot;: Mixcoac – Tláhuac==


Construction of line 12 began after a public consultation, on August 8, 2007, and inaugurated on October 30, 2012. Although the line offered full service during the first 16 months of operation (Mixcoac - Tláhuac), the service over the eleven easternmost stations was suspended indefinitely due to structural failures, with provisional terminal being Atlalilco as of October 2014. For the 18 months of the repair works, Line 12 ran from Mixcoac to Atlalilco, (9 stations), 4 of them linking with other lines, as well as with the Mexico City Metrobús.

According to the Mexico City Metro website, line 12 trains use traditional rail traction (as line A). Government nicknamed it the &quot;línea del Bicentenario&quot;, commemorating the 200th anniversary of the beginning of Mexican War of Independence on September 16, 1810 and promising to deliver all twenty stations by April 30, 2012. However, delays on train deliveries and construction caused full operation was delayed to October 30, 2012. At that date, President Calderón and Mayor Marcelo Ebrard opened the line to service.

In March 2014, 11 stations had to be closed because of security risks for the passengers because of rail corrugation. An investigation determined rails were incompatible with the trains, accusations of corruption arose. After 18 months line was repaired and resumed service.

On the night of May 3, 2021, an elevated portion collapsed causing 26 deaths and 70 injuries.

<doc id="463731" wikidata="Q463449" url="?curid=463731" title="American Austin Car Company">
<text>The American Austin Car Company Inc. was an American automobile manufacturing corporation incorporated in the state of Delaware. The company was founded on February 23, 1929, and produced motorcars licensed from the British Austin Motor Company from 1930 through 1934, after it had filed for bankruptcy protection. The company was liquidated in 1935 and the assets were acquired by Evans Operations, Inc. and a new company American Bantam Car Company was incorporated in June 1936.

==History==
American Austin Car Company set up manufacturing operations in Butler, Pennsylvania, in premises that had belonged to the Standard Steel Car Company. Their intention was to assemble and sell in the United States a version of the Austin 7 car, called American Austin. After some initial success the Great Depression set in, and sales fell off to the point that production was suspended. In 1934 the company filed for bankruptcy protection and in 1935 the company was liquidated.

The Austin automobile was designed in the hopes of creating a market for small-car enthusiasts in the United States. The cars had inline-four engines, enabling the car to return , and travel per fill of oil. It was capable of in high gear. Styling resembled small Chevrolets, with Stutz- and Marmon-style horizontal hood louvres. The bodies were designed by Alexis de Sakhnoffsky and made by the Hayes Body Company of Detroit. The coupe was billed as a sedan, and sold for $445, slightly less than a Ford V8 roadster. The Great Depression made the cheaper secondhand cars more appealing, so sales dropped off.

American Austin produced 8,448 cars were sold during 1930, the company&#x27;s first (and best) year of sales but only 1,279 vehicles were built in 1931. Sales fell off to the point that production was suspended in the spring of 1932. American Austin was reorganized, and Reuben O. Gill was appointed as president and general manager. Gill established a relationship with Roy Evans, owner of a large chain of dealerships in the southeast United States. By August production rose to an average of 600 vehicles per month with 3,846 cars being manufactured in 1932, with 80% of the cars sold to Evans. In 1933 American Austin domestic sales topped out at 4,726 units, still far short of the &quot;180,000 firm orders&quot; American Austin was supposed to have in 1929, before the crash. 

In 1934, running out of inventory for metal stamped body parts, American Austin started to produce small scale pickup trucks, making the bodies now in-house. But production slowed down and during the summer American Austin filed a petition in federal court to plan for reorganization. Production of vehicles finally stopped on December 1, 1934. By the end of 1934 about 20,000 American Austin cars had been produced.

On July 19, 1934 American Austin was ordered to show cause why an order for its liquidation should not be granted. The following week the federal court ordered the liquidation of American Austin and appointed Gill as trustee. When Evans heard that American Austin was about to be auctioned off, he quickly sent his good friend and lawyer Bill Ward Jr. to Butler to see if he might negotiate a favorable acquisition. Ward negotiated a deal to acquire the American Austin land, buildings, equipment and inventory for $5,000 cash in addition to assuming $214,099.83 in debt. On August 21, 1935, the liquidating trustee sold the assets of Austin to Roy S. Evans, Martin Tow and William A. Ward, Jr.

The day Evans&#x27; bid was accepted, a company called Industrial Improvement Company, of Indianapolis, Indiana, filed a bill of equity to block the sale of American Austin assets to Evans&#x27; syndicate. Industrial Improvement had made a competing bid, increasing the total offer by $5,000, but their bid had been rejected. When the presiding judge learned that 80% of the creditors supported Roy Evans&#x27; acquisition and had authorized the court to accept only Evans&#x27; bid he threw out the challenge and the sale of American Austin&#x27;s assets was final. 

A month after the sale of the assets, the factory was back in operation, now owned by Evans&#x27; syndicate and doing business as Evans Operations, Inc.

Beginning in the 1960s, the car gained a following with hot rodders, as well as among drag racers. The wheelbase made it attractive, even compared to the Anglia.

<doc id="463732" wikidata="Q14405936" url="?curid=463732" title="Slip (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, a slip fielder (collectively, a &quot;slip cordon&quot; or &quot;the slips&quot;) is placed behind the batsman on the off side of the field. They are placed with the aim of catching an edged ball which is beyond the wicket-keeper&#x27;s reach. Many teams employ two or three slips (numbered from the slip fielder closest to the wicket-keeper: first slip, second slip, etc.). A &quot;floating slip&quot; is sometimes employed, usually in limited over games, who patrols an area in the slip cordon that would ordinarily be occupied by more than one fielder. The slip cordon&#x27;s distance from the batsman increases with the pace of the bowler; generally they will be marginally further away from the batsman than the wicket-keeper is. Because of the resulting geometry, spin bowlers generally have fewer slips in the cordon than a fast bowler would in an equivalent game situation. 
As fielding in the slips requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept catchers in the team will make up the slip cordon. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen. Specialist slip fielders are sometimes called &quot;slippers&quot;.

The term &quot;slips&quot; is also used to refer to the area of the field where the slip cordon stands, or nth slip used specifically to refer to one slip fielder&#x27;s position—e.g., a ball may be described as being edged through third slip if it goes where a third slip would otherwise have been.

==Famous slip fielders==
With the most catches in test cricket, former Indian captain Rahul Dravid is considered one of the greatest slip fielders of all time. Mark Waugh would probably be considered the best of all time, with other brilliant exponents of the craft including Wally Hammond, Brian Lara, Mohammad Azharuddin, Sunil Gavaskar, Shane Warne, Michael Clarke, Sir Garfield Sobers, Bobby Simpson, Ian Chappell, Jacques Kallis, Brian McMillan, Mark Taylor, Ricky Ponting, VVS Laxman, Mahela Jayawardene, Stephen Fleming, Younis Khan, Matthew Hayden, Sir Ian Botham and Steve Smith.

==Gully==
The gully fielder is an extension of the line of slips and fields almost square to the batsman; gully is also the name given to that area of the field. A fielder standing at gully would be standing on the imaginary straight line that extends from the on-side corner of batsman&#x27;s popping crease to middle stump towards the slip cordon. The position of &quot;gully&quot; was invented in the 1880s by Arthur Jones, who later became England captain, at Bedford Modern School in Bedford. It was quickly adopted by EHD Sewell at Bedford School and then gained in popularity thereafter.

==Off theory==
Enticing the batsman to edge and hit a catch to the wicket-keeper or slips is the standard wicket-taking tactic in off theory. To do so, the bowler tries to make the ball deviate off its expected line away from the batsman&#x27;s body on the off-side. Outswingers or leg cutters, or the standard leg spinner are delivery types that have this effect. Unsurprisingly, bowlers bowling these deliveries effectively generally have larger slip cordons than those who are not.

On occasion, four or five slips are called for. England used seven slips in the first Test against West Indies in Jamaica in 2004; Australia went further and used the maximum of nine slips against Zimbabwe&#x27;s lower order batsmen in a One Day International in 2001 (the two non-slips fieldsmen in this example were the wicket-keeper and the bowler).

==Leg slip==
A fielder in the equivalent position on the on side of the wicket-keeper is known as a leg slip; this is considerably less common than the off-side slip, and for a team to employ more than one leg slip is highly unusual. It is illegal, under Law 41.5, to have more than two fielders in the area between square leg and long stop, to prevent the fielding team from making use of bodyline tactics.

Writing in &quot;The Cricketers of My Time&quot; (1833), John Nyren of Hambledon hints at the origin of the word &quot;slips&quot; when he describes the function of a long stop as a fielder who is required to cover any slips from the bat, both to the leg and the off-side.

<text>The fiddler crab or calling crab can be one of the hundred species of semiterrestrial marine crabs in the family Ocypodidae. These crabs are well known for their extreme sexual dimorphism, where the male crabs have a major claw significantly larger than their minor claw, whilst females claws are both the same size. The name fiddler crab comes from the appearance of their small and large claw together, looking similar to a fiddle.

A smaller number of ghost crab and mangrove crab species are also found in the family Ocypodidae. This entire group is composed of small crabs, the largest being &quot;Afruca tangeri&quot; which is slightly over two inches (5 cm) across. Fiddler crabs are found along sea beaches and brackish intertidal mud flats, lagoons, swamps, and various other types of brackish or salt-water wetlands. Whilst fiddler crabs are currently split into two subfamilies of Gelasiminae and Ucinae, there is still phylogenetic and taxonomical debate as to whether the movement from the overall genus of ‘’Uca’’ to these subfamilies and the separate 11 genera

Like all crabs, fiddler crabs shed their shells as they grow. If they have lost legs or claws during their present growth cycle, a new one will be present when they molt. If the major claw is lost, males will regenerate one on the same side after their next molt. Newly molted crabs are very vulnerable because of their soft shells. They are reclusive and hide until the new shell hardens.

In a controlled laboratory setting, fiddler crabs exhibit a constant circadian rhythm that mimics the ebb and flow of the tides: they turn dark during the day and light at night.

==Ecology and life cycle ==
Fiddler crabs primarily exist upon mudflats, sandy or muddy beaches as well as salt marshes within mangroves. Fiddler crabs are found in West Africa, the Western Atlantic, the Eastern Pacific, Indo-Pacific and Algarve region of Portugal. 

Whilst the fiddler crab is classified as an omnivore, it does present itself as an opportunist and will consume anything with nutritional value. The crab will feed through bringing a chunk of sediment to its mouth and sifting through it to extract organic material. This crab will filter out algae, microbes, fungus or any form of detritus. Once finished consuming all the organic matter from the sediment, these crabs will then deposit them as small sand balls near their burrow. 

Fiddler crabs are thought to potentially act as ecosystem engineers within their habitat due to the way they rework the sediment during feeding. Whilst these crabs do rework the sediment around them, upturning the very top layer and depositing it nearby, there is still debate that exists as to whether this turnover of sediment has any proven difference regarding nutrients and aeration of the sediment.

Fiddler crabs are a burrowing species, where within their territory they may possess several burrows. There are two types of burrows that the fiddler crabs can build, either breeding burrows or temporary burrows. Temporary burrows are constructed by both males and females during high tide periods. These burrows are also constructed at night time when the crabs are no longer feeding and are hiding from predators. Breeding burrows are constructed by solely males, and will be constructed within the area that they have deemed their territory. These breeding burrows are constructed by male crabs so that the female and male crabs may copulate within the burrow, and the female may deposit and incubate her eggs within this area. Larger males who can more easily defend their territory will often have multiple suitable breeding burrows within their territory to enable them to mate with multiple female crabs. Female crabs are found to prefer to mate with males that have the widest burrows, however, carapace width and claw size does correlate with the width of the burrow, so could be a potential size bias. 

Two types of fiddler crabs are found to exist within a given territory, a wandering female or male, and territory-holding male or females. When in a wandering state, this means crabs do not currently occupy a burrow. They will wander in order to look for territory which contains a burrow, or to look for a mate. Wandering females will look for a mate to copulate with, usually preferring to mate with a male that currently possesses a burrow. The female fiddler carries her eggs in a mass on the underside of her body. She remains in her burrow during a two-week gestation period, after which she ventures out to release her eggs into the receding tide. The larvae remain planktonic for a further two weeks.

The mating system of fiddler crabs is thought to be mainly polygynous, where the male crabs will mate with multiple females if they have the opportunity to, however, female fiddler crabs such as the &quot;Austruca lactea&quot; are known to also mate with multiple males. 

As they are a species of crustacean, they perform ecdysis, which is the process of moulting. When crabs moult, they produce hormones which trigger the shedding of their exoskeleton and regeneration of limbs. Moulting is already an extremely stressful time for fiddler crabs, as their shell becomes extremely soft, leaving them vulnerable to predation. When undergoing this moulting cycle, crabs will frequently hide within their burrows to avoid harm. When male crabs are undergoing the moulting process, if they are exposed to other male crabs in high grouping with consistent light, their ability to regenerate limbs will be impaired.

Whilst the crabs major claw does function as a tool for fighting and competition, it also plays a role in thermoregulation. As the claw is so large, and these crabs live in generally hot territory, so require strategies to keep themselves cool, particularly for wandering males without burrows. The presence of the major claw upon the male helps them keep their body temperature regulated, and decreases the chance of them losing or gaining too much heat in a given time period. The large claw draws away excess body heat from the core of the fiddler crab and allows it to dissipate. Heat is found to dissipate significantly faster when male crabs are performing waving at the same time. 

Fiddler crabs come in many different colourations and patterns, and are known to be able to change their colour over time. Fiddler crabs such as the &quot;Tubuca capricornis&quot; are capable of changing their colour rapidly when placed under significant stress. When fiddler crabs undergo moulting, they are seen to have reduced colouration after each sequential moult. Female fiddler crabs are traditionally more colourful than male fiddler crabs. Conspicuous colouring in fiddler crabs is dangerous as it increases predation rate, however, sexual selection argues for brightly coloured crabs. Fiddler crabs have finely tuned visual systems that aid in detecting colours of importance, which aid in selecting coloured mates. When given the choice, females prefer to pick males that are more brightly coloured in comparison to dull males.

==Behaviour, competition, and courtship==

Fiddler crabs live rather brief lives of no more than two years (up to three years in captivity). Male fiddler crabs use many signalling techniques and performances towards females to win over a female to mate. Females choose their mate based on claw size and also quality of the waving display. 

It is very common for male fiddler crabs to be viewed fighting against one another. Male fiddler crabs fight primarily over females and territory. Whilst fights within fiddler crabs are commonly male against male fights, male fiddler crabs will also fight against female fiddler crabs when there is suitable territory with a burrow that the male wishes to obtain. When fighting, male fiddler crabs can often have their major claw ripped off, or have it harmed to the point where male fiddler crabs must autotomize this claw. Whilst this claw can regrow when the crab next moults, the properties of the claw will not be the same as they were previously. Whilst the size of the claw will be the same or similar to how it was before, the claw will become significantly weaker. Whilst this claw is now significantly weaker, other crabs cannot tell that this claw is weaker, so will assume the claw is at full size and strength. This is a form of dishonest signalling, where the appearance of the claw displayed to other fiddler crabs does not represent the true mechanics of the claw.

In order for a male fiddler crab to help produce offspring, he must first attract a mate and convince her to mate with him. To win over females, male crabs will performed a waving display towards females. This waving display consists of raising the major claw upwards and then dropping it down towards itself in what appears as a &#x27;come here&#x27; motion, like a beckoning sign. Male crabs will exhibit two forms of waving towards females to attempt to court them. Broadcast waving is a general wave the male crabs perform when a female crab is not within their field of view. This wave is at a slower pace, as to not use up energy reserves. Directed waving is performed by male crabs when they have spotted a female they wish to mate with. This wave is performed through the male crab facing towards the female, and increasing the pace of the wave towards the female. 
When males are waving at females, this is usually done in synchrony with other male crabs in the neighbouring area. Synchronous waving does provide a general positive benefit for male crabs attempting to attract wandering females, as a form of cooperative behaviour. Synchrony however, does not provide an individual benefit, as females prefer to mate with the male that is leading the synchronous wave. Therefore, synchronous waving is thought to have evolved as an incidental byproduct of males competing to lead the wave.

Fiddler crabs are also known to build sedimentary pillars around their burrows out of mud and sand. 49 of the total species under the family Ocypodidae will construct sedimentary pillars outside of their burrows for the purposes of courtship and defense from other crabs. These structures can be built by either male or female crabs and will be one of the six known structures constructed by fiddler crabs. Fiddler crabs can build either a chimney, hood, pillar, semidome, mudball or rim. These mud pillars have correlations with sediment type, genus and sex. Females are more likely to be attracted to a male if he has a sedimentary pillar outside of his burrow in comparison to a male crab without a pillar. When females are not actively being courted, they are more likely to move to an empty burrow which has a pillar present in comparison to an empty burrow without a pillar present. Fiddler crabs with any hood or dome formed pillar above their burrow are more likely to be shy crabs that take less risks. 

Female crabs will choose their mate based upon the claw size of the male, as well as the quality of the waving display, if he was the leader of the synchronous waving, and if the male currently possesses territory with a burrow for them to copulate within. Females will also prefer to mate with males who have the widest and largest burrows. 

Fiddler crabs such as &quot;Austruca mjoebergi&quot; have been shown to bluff about their fighting ability. Upon regrowing a lost claw, a crab will occasionally regrow a weaker claw that nevertheless intimidates crabs with smaller but stronger claws. This is an example of dishonest signalling.

The dual functionality of the major claw of fiddler crabs has presented an evolutionary conundrum in that the claw mechanics best suited for fighting do not match up with the mechanics best suited for a waving display.

==Genera and species==
More than 100 species of fiddler crabs make up 11 of the 13 genera in the crab family Ocypodidae. These were formerly members of the genus &quot;Uca&quot;. In 2016, most of the subgenera of &quot;Uca&quot; were elevated to genus rank, and the fiddler crabs now occupy 11 genera making up the subfamilies Gelasiminae and Ucinae.

==Captivity==
Fiddler crabs are occasionally kept as pets. The fiddler crabs sold in pet stores generally come from brackish water lagoons. Because they live in lower salinity water, pet stores may call them fresh-water crabs, but they cannot survive indefinitely in fresh water. Fiddler crabs have been known to attack small fish in captivity, as opposed to their natural feeding habits.

<text>Public health is &quot;the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals&quot;. Analyzing the determinants of health of a population and the threats it faces is the basis for public health. The &quot;public&quot; can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city; in the case of a pandemic it may encompass several continents. The concept of &quot;health&quot; takes into account physical, psychological, and social well-being, among other factors.

Public health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, oral health, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health. Public health, together with primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, is part of a country&#x27;s overall healthcare system. Public health is implemented through the surveillance of cases and health indicators, and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promotion of hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, promoting ventilation and improved air quality both indoors and outdoors, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity education, increasing healthcare accessibility and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

There is a significant disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed countries and developing countries, as well as within developing countries. In developing countries, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained healthcare workers, monetary resources, or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. A major public health concern in developing countries is poor maternal and child health, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty coupled with governments&#x27; reluctance in implementing public health policies. Developed nations are at greater risk of certain public health crises, including childhood obesity, although overweight populations in low- and middle-income countries are catching up.

From the beginnings of human civilization, communities promoted health and fought disease at the population level. In complex, pre-industrialized societies, interventions designed to reduce health risks could be the initiative of different stakeholders, such as army generals, the clergy or rulers. Great Britain became a leader in the development of public health initiatives, beginning in the 19th century, due to the fact that it was the first modern urban nation worldwide. The public health initiatives that began to emerge initially focused on sanitation (for example, the Liverpool and London sewerage systems), control of infectious diseases (including vaccination and quarantine) and an evolving infrastructure of various sciences, e.g. statistics, microbiology, epidemiology, sciences of engineering.

== Definition ==

Public health has been defined as &quot;the science and art of preventing disease&quot;, prolonging life and improving quality of life through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations (public and private), communities and individuals. The &quot;public&quot; can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city. The concept of &quot;health&quot; takes into account physical, psychological, and social well-being. As such, according to the World Health Organization, &quot;health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity&quot;.

=== Related terms ===

Public health is related to global health which is the health of populations in the worldwide context. It has been defined as &quot;the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in &quot;Health for all&quot; people worldwide&quot;. International health is a field of health care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries. Public health is not the same as public healthcare (publicly funded health care).

The term preventive medicine is related to public health. The American Board of Preventive Medicine separates three categories of preventive medicine: aerospace health, occupational health, and public health and general preventative medicine. Jung, Boris and Lushniak argue that preventive medicine should be considered the medical specialty for public health but note that the American College of Preventive Medicine and American Board of Preventive Medicine do not prominently use the term &quot;public health&quot;. Preventive medicine specialists are trained as clinicians and address complex health needs of a population such as by assessing the need for disease prevention programs, using the best methods to implement them, and assessing their effectiveness.

Since the 1990s many scholars in public health have been using the term population health. There are no medical specialties directly related to population health. Valles argues that consideration of health equity is a fundamental part of population health. Scholars such as Coggon and Pielke express concerns about bringing general issues of wealth distribution into population health. Pielke worries about &quot;stealth issue advocacy&quot; in population health. Jung, Boris and Lushniak consider population health to be a concept that is the goal of an activity called public health practiced through the specialty preventive medicine.

Lifestyle medicine uses individual lifestyle modification to prevent or revert disease and can be considered a component of preventive medicine and public health. It is implemented as part of primary care rather than a specialty in its own right. Valles argues that the term social medicine has a narrower and more biomedical focus than the term population health.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of a public health intervention is to prevent and mitigate diseases, injuries, and other health conditions. The overall goal is to improve the health of individuals and populations, and to increase life expectancy.

== Components ==
Public health is a complex term, composed of many elements and different practices. It is a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health.

Modern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include epidemiologists, biostatisticians, physician assistants, public health nurses, midwives, medical microbiologists, pharmacists, economists, sociologists, geneticists, data managers, environmental health officers (public health inspectors), bioethicists, gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists, physicians, and veterinarians.

The elements and priorities of public health have evolved over time, and are continuing to evolve. Common public health initiatives include promotion of hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity education, increasing healthcare accessibility and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

== Methods ==

Public health aims are achieved through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors, communities and environments. Analyzing the determinants of health of a population and the threats it faces is the basis for public health.

Many diseases are preventable through simple, nonmedical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of handwashing with soap can prevent the spread of many contagious diseases. In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing its spread to others, either during an outbreak of infectious disease or through contamination of food or water supplies.

Public health, together with primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, is part of a country&#x27;s overall health care system. Many interventions of public health interest are delivered outside of health facilities, such as food safety surveillance, distribution of condoms and needle-exchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseases.

Public health requires Geographic Information Systems (GIS) because risk, vulnerability and exposure involve geographic aspects.

== Ethics ==

A dilemma in public health ethics is dealing with the conflict between individual rights and maximizing right to health. Public health is justified by consequentialist utilitarian ideas, but is constrained and critiqued by liberal, deontological, principlist and libertarian philosophies Stephen Holland argues that it can be easy to find a particular framework to justify any viewpoint on public health issues, but that the correct approach is to find a framework that best describes a situation and see what it implies about public health policy.

The definition of health is vague and there are many conceptualizations. Public health practitioners definition of health can different markedly from members of the public or clinicians. This can mean that members of the public view the values behind public health interventions as alien which can cause resentment amongst the public towards certain interventions. Such vagueness can be a problem for health promotion. Critics have argued that public health tends to place more focus on individual factors associated with health at the expense of factors operating at the population level.

Historically, public health campaigns have been criticized as a form of &quot;healthism&quot;, as moralistic in nature rather than being focused on health. Medical doctors, Petr Shkrabanek and James McCormick wrote a series of publications on this topic in the late 1980s and early 1990s criticizing the UK&#x27;s &quot;the Health of The Nation&quot; campaign. These publications exposed abuse of epidemiology and statistics by the public health movement to support lifestyle interventions and screening programs. A combination of inculcating a fear of ill-health and a strong notion of individual responsibility has been criticized as a form of &quot;health fascism&quot; by a number of scholars, objectifying the individual with no considerations of emotional or social factors.

== Priority areas ==
=== Original focal areas ===

When public health initiatives began to emerge in England in modern times (18th century onwards) there were three core strands of public health which were all related to statecraft: Supply of clean water and sanitation (for example London sewerage system); control of infectious diseases (including vaccination and quarantine); an evolving infrastructure of various sciences, e.g. statistics, microbiology, epidemiology, sciences of engineering. Great Britain was a leader in the development of public health during that time period out of necessity: Great Britain was the first modern urban nation (by 1851 more than half of the population lived in settlements of more than 2000 people). This led to a certain type of distress which then led to public health initiatives. Later that particular concern faded away.

=== Changing focal areas and expanding scope ===

With the onset of the epidemiological transition and as the prevalence of infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century, public health began to put more focus on chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the infant mortality rate using preventive methods. In Britain, the infant mortality rate fell from over 15% in 1870 to 7% by 1930.

A major public health concern in developing countries is poor maternal and child health, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty. The WHO reports that a lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year.

Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including HIV/AIDS, diabetes, waterborne diseases, zoonotic diseases, and antibiotic resistance leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Antibiotic resistance, also known as drug resistance, was the theme of World Health Day 2011.

For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide have diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by 2030. In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;, the authors opined that &quot;The fact that type 2 diabetes, a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation.&quot; The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of obesity. The WHO&#x27;s latest estimates highlighted that globally approximately 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2014, and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2014. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low-income countries, especially in urban settings.

Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including healthy diet and physical exercise. The National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) has published a review of research on what local authorities can do to tackle obesity. The review covers interventions in the food environment (what people buy and eat), the built and natural environments, schools, and the community, as well as those focussing on active travel, leisure services and public sports, weight management programmes, and system-wide approaches.

Health inequalities, driven by the social determinants of health, are also a growing area of concern in public health. A central challenge to securing health equity is that the same social structures that contribute to health inequities also operate and are reproduced by public health organizations. In other words, public health organizations have evolved to better meet the needs of some groups more than others. The result is often that those most in need of preventative interventions are least likely to receive them and interventions can actually aggravate inequities as they are often inadvertently tailored to the needs of the normative group. Identifying bias within public health research and practice is essential to ensuring public health efforts mitigate and don&#x27;t aggravate health inequities.

=== Organizations ===

==== World Health Organization (WHO) ====
The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. The WHO Constitution, which establishes the agency&#x27;s governing structure and principles, states its main objective as &quot;the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health&quot;. The WHO&#x27;s broad mandate includes advocating for universal healthcare, monitoring public health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting human health and well-being. The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse.

==== Others ====
Most countries have their own governmental public health agency, often called the ministry of health, with responsibility for domestic health issues.

For example, in the United States, state and local health departments are on the front line of public health initiatives. In addition to their national duties, the United States Public Health Service (PHS), led by the Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, headquartered in Atlanta, are also involved with international health activities.

=== Public health programs ===

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions. However, public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. Although the collaboration of local health and government agencies is considered best practice to improve public health, the pieces of evidence available to support this is limited. Public health programs providing vaccinations have made major progress in promoting health, including substantially reducing the occurrence of cholera and polio and eradicating smallpox, diseases that have plagued humanity for thousands of years.

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies core functions of public health programs including:
* providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping a research agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge;
* setting a norms 
and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options;
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.

In particular, public health surveillance programs can:
* serve as an early warning system for impending public health emergencies;
* document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and
* monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform health policy and strategies.
* diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community

The &quot;Truth&quot; campaign, launched by the American Legacy Foundation in 2000. This campaign aimed to educate and discourage young people from smoking by exposing the tobacco industry&#x27;s deceptive practices. Through a combination of powerful visuals, persuasive storytelling, and relatable messaging, the &quot;Truth&quot; campaign successfully reduced smoking rates among teenagers and young adults. 

=== Behavior change ===

Many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved reward system for substances such as drugs, tobacco, alcohol, refined salt, fat, and carbohydrates. New technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity. Research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects. The marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others. Films are increasingly being recognized as a public health tool, with the Harvard University&#x27;s T.H. Chan School of Public Health categorizing such films as &quot;impact filmmaking.&quot; In fact, film festivals and competitions have been established to specifically promote films about health. Conversely, it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking. Public libraries can also be beneficial tools for public health changes. They provide access to healthcare information, link people to healthcare services, and even can provide direct care in certain situations.

===Applications in health care===
As well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions, public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for health care services, including:
* Assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the health care system
* Ascertaining requirements as expressed by health professionals, the public and other stakeholders
* Identifying the most appropriate interventions
* Considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their cost-effectiveness
* Supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes.
* Informing, educating, and empowering people about health issues

=== Conflicting aims ===
Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of HIV transmission through safe sex campaigns and needle-exchange programs. Another is the control of tobacco smoking. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Supporters argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting passive (second-hand) smoking and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be encouraged to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall.

Psychological research confirms this tension between concerns about public health and concerns about personal liberty: (i) the best predictor of complying with public health recommendations such as hand-washing, mask-wearing, and staying at home (except for essential activity) during the COVID-19 pandemic was people&#x27;s perceived duties to prevent harm but (ii) the best predictor of flouting such public health recommendations was valuing liberty more than equality.

Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a global health priority, non-communicable diseases and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing, however, as illustrated by the United Nations hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011.

== Global perspectives ==
=== Disparities in service and access ===
There is a significant disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed countries and developing countries, as well as within developing countries. In developing countries, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained health workers, monetary resources or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in developing countries results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than $100 USD per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the federal government spent approximately $10,600 USD per capita in 2019. However, expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health. Public health measures may not generally be considered &quot;health care&quot; in the strictest sense. For example, mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population, but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care.

Large parts of the world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases. In addition to this however, many developing countries are also experiencing an epidemiological shift and polarization in which populations are now experiencing more of the effects of chronic diseases as life expectancy increases, the poorer communities being heavily affected by both chronic and infectious diseases. Another major public health concern in the developing world is poor maternal and child health, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty. The WHO reports that a lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year. Intermittent preventive therapy aimed at treating and preventing malaria episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in endemic countries.

Since the 1980s, the growing field of population health has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that health is affected by many factors including class, race, income, educational status, region of residence, and social relationships; these are known as &quot;social determinants of health&quot;. The upstream drivers such as environment, education, employment, income, food security, housing, social inclusion and many others effect the distribution of health between and within populations and are often shaped by policy. A social gradient in health runs through society. The poorest generally have the worst health, but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social level. The new public health advocates for population-based policies that improve health in an equitable manner.

The health sector is one of Europe&#x27;s most labor-intensive industries. In late 2020, it accounted for more than 21 million employment in the European Union when combined with social work. According to the WHO, several countries began the COVID-19 pandemic with insufficient health and care professionals, inappropriate skill mixtures, and unequal geographical distributions. These issues were worsened by the pandemic, reiterating the importance of public health. In the United States, a history of underinvestment in public health undermined the public health workforce and support for population health, long before the pandemic added to stress, mental distress, job dissatisfaction, and accelerated departures among public health workers.

=== Health aid in developing countries ===
Health aid to developing countries is an important source of public health funding for many developing countries. Health aid to developing countries has shown a significant increase after World War II as concerns over the spread of disease as a result of globalization increased and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa surfaced. From 1990 to 2010, total health aid from developed countries increased from 5.5 billion to 26.87 billion with wealthy countries continuously donating billions of dollars every year with the goal of improving population health. Some efforts, however, receive a significantly larger proportion of funds such as HIV which received an increase in funds of over $6 billion between 2000 and 2010 which was more than twice the increase seen in any other sector during those years. Health aid has seen an expansion through multiple channels including private philanthropy, non-governmental organizations, private foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation or the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, bilateral donors, and multilateral donors such as the World Bank or UNICEF. The result has been a sharp rise in uncoordinated and fragmented funding of an ever-increasing number of initiatives and projects. To promote better strategic cooperation and coordination between partners, particularly among bilateral development agencies and funding organizations, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) spearheaded the establishment of ESSENCE, an initiative to facilitate dialogue between donors/funders, allowing them to identify synergies. ESSENCE brings together a wide range of funding agencies to coordinate funding efforts.

In 2009 health aid from the OECD amounted to $12.47 billion which amounted to 11.4% of its total bilateral aid. In 2009, Multilateral donors were found to spend 15.3% of their total aid on bettering public healthcare.

==== International health aid debates ====
Debates exist questioning the efficacy of international health aid. Supporters of aid claim that health aid from wealthy countries is necessary in order for developing countries to escape the poverty trap. Opponents of health aid claim that international health aid actually disrupts developing countries&#x27; course of development, causes dependence on aid, and in many cases the aid fails to reach its recipients. For example, recently, health aid was funneled towards initiatives such as financing new technologies like antiretroviral medication, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and new vaccines. The positive impacts of these initiatives can be seen in the eradication of smallpox and polio; however, critics claim that misuse or misplacement of funds may cause many of these efforts to never come into achievement.

Economic modeling based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the World Health Organization has shown a link between international health aid in developing countries and a reduction in adult mortality rates. However, a 2014–2016 study suggests that a potential confounding variable for this outcome is the possibility that aid was directed at countries once they were already on track for improvement. That same study, however, also suggests that 1 billion dollars in health aid was associated with 364,000 fewer deaths occurring between ages 0 and 5 in 2011.

=== Sustainable development goals for 2030 ===

To address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world, the United Nations have developed the Sustainable Development Goals to be completed by 2030. These goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations, however Goals 1–6 directly address health disparities, primarily in developing countries. These six goals address key issues in global public health, poverty, hunger and food security, health, education, gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment, and water and sanitation. Public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations. These goals are designed to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future. The links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established.

==History==
===Until the 18th century===
From the beginnings of human civilization, communities promoted health and fought disease at the population level. Definitions of health as well as methods to pursue it differed according to the medical, religious and natural-philosophical ideas groups held, the resources they had, and the changing circumstances in which they lived. Yet few early societies displayed the hygienic stagnation or even apathy often attributed to them. The latter reputation is mainly based on the absence of present-day bioindicators, especially immunological and statistical tools developed in light of the germ theory of disease transmission.

Public health was born neither in Europe nor as a response to the Industrial Revolution. Preventive health interventions are attested almost anywhere historical communities have left their mark. In Southeast Asia, for instance, Ayurvedic medicine and subsequently Buddhism fostered occupational, dietary and sexual regimens that promised balanced bodies, lives and communities, a notion strongly present in Traditional Chinese Medicine as well. Among the Mayans, Aztecs and other early civilizations in the Americas, population centers pursued hygienic programs, including by holding medicinal herbal markets. And among Aboriginal Australians, techniques for preserving and protecting water and food sources, micro-zoning to reduce pollution and fire risks, and screens to protect people against flies were common, even in temporary camps.

Western European, Byzantine and Islamicate civilizations, which generally adopted a Hippocratic, Galenic or humoral medical system, fostered preventive programs as well. These were developed on the basis of evaluating the quality of local climates, including topography, wind conditions and exposure to the sun, and the properties and availability of water and food, for both humans and nonhuman animals. Diverse authors of medical, architectural, engineering and military manuals explained how to apply such theories to groups of different origins and under different circumstances. This was crucial, since under Galenism bodily constitutions were thought to be heavily shaped by their material environments, so their balance required specific regimens as they traveled during different seasons and between climate zones.

In complex, pre-industrialized societies, interventions designed to reduce health risks could be the initiative of different stakeholders. For instance, in Greek and Roman antiquity, army generals learned to provide for soldiers&#x27; wellbeing, including off the battlefield, where most combatants died prior to the twentieth century. In Christian monasteries across the Eastern Mediterranean and western Europe since at least the fifth century CE, monks and nuns pursued strict but balanced regimens, including nutritious diets, developed explicitly to extend their lives. And royal, princely and papal courts, which were often mobile as well, likewise adapted their behavior to suit environmental conditions in the sites they occupied. They could also choose sites they considered salubrious for their members and sometimes had them modified.

In cities, residents and rulers developed measures to benefit the general population, which faced a broad array of recognized health risks. These provide some of the most sustained evidence for preventive measures in earlier civilizations. In numerous sites the upkeep of infrastructures, including roads, canals and marketplaces, as well as zoning policies, were introduced explicitly to preserve residents&#x27; health. Officials such as the muhtasib in the Middle East and the Road master in Italy, fought the combined threats of pollution through sin, ocular intromission and miasma. Craft guilds were important agents of waste disposal and promoted harm reduction through honesty and labor safety among their members. Medical practitioners, including public physicians, collaborated with urban governments in predicting and preparing for calamities and identifying and isolating people perceived as lepers, a disease with strong moral connotations. Neighborhoods were also active in safeguarding local people&#x27;s health, by monitoring at-risk sites near them and taking appropriate social and legal action against artisanal polluters and neglectful owners of animals. Religious institutions, individuals and charitable organizations in both Islam and Christianity likewise promoted moral and physical wellbeing by endowing urban amenities such as wells, fountains, schools and bridges, also in the service of pilgrims. In western Europe and Byzantium, religious processions commonly took place, which purported to act as both preventive and curative measures for the entire community.

Urban residents and other groups also developed preventive measures in response to calamities such as war, famine, floods and widespread disease. During and after the Black Death (1346–53), for instance, inhabitants of the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Europe reacted to massive population decline in part on the basis of existing medical theories and protocols, for instance concerning meat consumption and burial, and in part by developing new ones. The latter included the establishment of quarantine facilities and health boards, some of which eventually became regular urban (and later national) offices. Subsequent measures for protecting cities and their regions included issuing health passports for travelers, deploying guards to create sanitary cordons for protecting local inhabitants, and gathering morbidity and mortality statistics. Such measures relied in turn on better transportation and communication networks, through which news on human and animal disease was efficiently spread.

===After the 18th century===
With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, living standards amongst the working population began to worsen, with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions. In the first four decades of the 19th century alone, London&#x27;s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns, such as Leeds and Manchester. This rapid urbanization exacerbated the spread of disease in the large conurbations that built up around the workhouses and factories. These settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized sanitation. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants. Unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of slums and the per capita death rate began to rise alarmingly, almost doubling in Birmingham and Liverpool. Thomas Malthus warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798. His ideas, as well as those of Jeremy Bentham, became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century. The latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries: a social evil was identified, private philanthropists brought attention to it, and changing public opinion led to government action. The 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in England.

The practice of vaccination began in the 1800s, following the pioneering work of Edward Jenner in treating smallpox. James Lind&#x27;s discovery of the causes of scurvy amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of fruit on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the Royal Navy. Efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public; in 1752 the British physician Sir John Pringle published &quot;Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison&quot;, in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the military barracks and the provision of latrines for the soldiers.

====Public health legislation in England====
The first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s. Thomas Southwood Smith, physician at the London Fever Hospital, began to write papers on the importance of public health, and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the Poor Law Commission in the 1830s, along with Neil Arnott and James Phillips Kay. Smith advised the government on the importance of quarantine and sanitary improvement for limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and yellow fever.

The Poor Law Commission reported in 1838 that &quot;the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered&quot;. It recommended the implementation of large scale government engineering projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease. The Health of Towns Association was formed at Exeter Hall London on 11 December 1844, and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the United Kingdom. Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir Edwin Chadwick, which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities.

These national and local movements led to the Public Health Act, finally passed in 1848. It aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing the supply of water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing and paving under a single local body with the General Board of Health as a central authority. The Act was passed by the Liberal government of Lord John Russell, in response to the urging of Edwin Chadwick. Chadwick&#x27;s seminal report on &quot;The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population&quot; was published in 1842 and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later. During this time, James Newlands (appointed following the passing of the 1846 Liverpool Sanatory Act championed by the Borough of Liverpool Health of Towns Committee) designed the world&#x27;s first integrated sewerage system, in Liverpool (1848–1869), with Joseph Bazalgette later creating London&#x27;s sewerage system (1858–1875).

The Vaccination Act 1853 introduced compulsory smallpox vaccination in England and Wales. By 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers.

Further interventions were made by a series of subsequent Public Health Acts, notably the 1875 Act. Reforms included the building of sewers, the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a landfill, the provision of clean water and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

The Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 72) mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority, which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties.

==== Public health legislation in other countries ====

In the United States, the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in New York City in 1866.

During The Weimar Republic, Germany faced many public health catastrophes. The Nazi Party had a goal of modernizing health care with &quot;Volksgesundheit&quot;, German for &quot;people&#x27;s public health&quot;; this modernization was based on the growing field of eugenics and measures prioritizing group health over any care for the health of individuals. The end of World War 2 led to the Nuremberg Code, a set of research ethics concerning human experimentation.

====Epidemiology====

The science of epidemiology was founded by John Snow&#x27;s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in London. Snow believed in the germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing miasma theory. By talking to local residents (with the help of Reverend Henry Whitehead), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now Broadwick Street). Although Snow&#x27;s chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the Broad Street pump did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to close the well pump by removing its handle.

Snow later used a dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow&#x27;s study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology.

====Control of infectious diseases====
With the pioneering work in bacteriology of French chemist Louis Pasteur and German scientist Robert Koch, methods for isolating the bacteria responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century. British physician Ronald Ross identified the mosquito as the carrier of malaria and laid the foundations for combating the disease. Joseph Lister revolutionized surgery by the introduction of antiseptic surgery to eliminate infection. French epidemiologist Paul-Louis Simond proved that plague was carried by fleas on the back of rats, and Cuban scientist Carlos J. Finlay and U.S. Americans Walter Reed and James Carroll demonstrated that mosquitoes carry the virus responsible for yellow fever. Brazilian scientist Carlos Chagas identified a tropical disease and its vector.

== Society and culture ==

===Education and training===
Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Schools of Public Health, Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a university degree with a focus on core disciplines of biostatistics, epidemiology, health services administration, health policy, health education, behavioral science, gender issues, sexual and reproductive health, public health nutrition, and occupational and environmental health.

In the global context, the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades, supported by institutions such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank, among others. Operational structures are formulated by strategic principles, with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks, all requiring modulation according to local, national and global realities. Moreover, integrating technology or digital platforms to connect to low health literacy LHL groups could be a way to increase health literacy. It is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity, and not depend on other countries to supply it. 

====Schools of public health: a US perspective====
In the United States, the Welch-Rose Report of 1915 has been viewed as the basis for the critical movement in the history of the institutional schism between public health and medicine because it led to the establishment of schools of public health supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The report was authored by William Welch, founding dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Wickliffe Rose of the Rockefeller Foundation. The report focused more on research than practical education. Some have blamed the Rockefeller Foundation&#x27;s 1916 decision to support the establishment of schools of public health for creating the schism between public health and medicine and legitimizing the rift between medicine&#x27;s laboratory investigation of the mechanisms of disease and public health&#x27;s nonclinical concern with environmental and social influences on health and wellness.

Even though schools of public health had already been established in Canada, Europe and North Africa, the United States had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions. A $25,000 donation from businessman Samuel Zemurray instituted the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914. The Yale School of Public Health was founded by Charles-Edward Amory Winslow in 1915. The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health was founded in 1916 and became an independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States. By 1922, schools of public health were established at Columbia and Harvard on the Hopkins model. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students.

Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for medical professionals. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

====Degrees in public health====
Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees generally fall into two categories: professional or academic. The two major postgraduate degrees are the Master of Public Health (MPH) or the Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in a subspecialty of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional degree and PhD as more of an academic degree.

Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The Master of Public Health, Doctor of Public Health, Doctor of Health Science (DHSc/DHS) and the Master of Health Care Administration are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms, among others. Master of Public Health degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more wide range of methodologies. A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research. The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc: The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree.

Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and preventive medicine who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Science (ScD), and Doctor of Health Science (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a dissertation research project.

=== Notable people ===
* John Graunt (1620–1674) was a British citizen scientist who laid the foundations for epidemiology.
* Edward Jenner (1749–1823) created the smallpox vaccine, the first vaccine in the world. He is often known as &quot;the father of immunology&quot;.
* Benjamin Waterhouse (1753–1846) introduced the smallpox vaccine in the United States.
* Lemuel Shattuck (1793–1859) has been described as an &quot;architect&quot; and &quot;prophet&quot; of American public health
* John Snow (1813–1858) was &#x27;the father of modern epidemiology&#x27;.
* Sir Joseph William Bazalgette (1819–1891) created a sewer network for central London in response to the Great Stink of 1858. This proved instrumental in relieving the city from cholera epidemics.
* Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) conducted research that laid the foundation for our understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases.
* Robert Koch (1843–1910) used his discoveries to establish that germs &quot;could cause a specific disease&quot;and directly provided proofs for that germ theory of diseases, therefore creating the scientific basis of public health, saving millions of lives.
* Charles V. Chapin (1856–1941) public health advocate and researcher credited with planting &quot;the roots of quality in public health&quot; in the United States
* Sara Josephine Baker (1873–1945) was an &quot;instrumental force in child and maternal health&quot;
* Nora Wattie (1900–1994) led the development of public health services and sanitation, and education in improving women and child health in the poorest slums of Glasgow, for which she received the OBE.
* Jonas Salk (1914–1995) developed one of the first polio vaccines and campaigned vigorously for mandatory vaccinations.
* Ruth Huenemann (1910–2005) She became a pioneer in the study of childhood obesity in the 1960s studying the diet and exercise habits of Berkeley teenagers.
* Edmond Fernandes ( 1990-) Demonstrated proof of concept to end the burden of Malnutrition in India and around the world.
* Dilip Mahalanabis - Credited to have evolved and utilized ORS to save thousands of lives during the liberation war.

== Country examples ==

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention.

=== Cuba ===
Since the 1959 Cuban Revolution, the Cuban government has devoted extensive resources to the improvement of health conditions for its entire population via universal access to health care. Infant mortality has plummeted. Cuban medical internationalism as a policy has seen the Cuban government sent doctors as a form of aid and export to countries in need in Latin America, especially Venezuela, as well as Oceania and Africa countries.

===Colombia and Bolivia===
Public health was important elsewhere in Latin America in consolidating state power and integrating marginalized populations into the nation-state. In Colombia, public health was a means for creating and implementing ideas of citizenship. In Bolivia, a similar push came after their 1952 revolution.

=== Ghana ===

Though curable and preventive, malaria remains a major public health issue and is the third leading cause of death in Ghana. In the absence of a vaccine, mosquito control, or access to anti-malaria medication, public health methods become the main strategy for reducing the prevalence and severity of malaria. These methods include reducing breeding sites, screening doors and windows, insecticide sprays, prompt treatment following infection, and usage of insecticide treated mosquito nets. Distribution and sale of insecticide-treated mosquito nets is a common, cost-effective anti-malaria public health intervention; however, barriers to use exist including cost, household and family organization, access to resources, and social and behavioral determinants which have not only been shown to affect malaria prevalence rates but also mosquito net use.

=== France ===
===Mexico===
=== United States ===

Led by Massachusetts, the states developed public health programs in the late 19th century. 

The United States lacks a coherent system for the governmental funding of public health, relying on a variety of agencies and programs at the federal, state and local levels.
Between 1960 and 2001, public health spending in the United States tended to grow,
based on increasing expenditures by state and local government, which made up 80–90% of
total public health spending. Spending in support of public health in the United States peaked in 2002 and declined in the following decade. State cuts to public health funding during the Great Recession of 2007–2008 were not restored in subsequent years.
As of 2012, a panel for the U.S. Institute of Medicine panel warned that the United States spends disproportionately far more on clinical care than it does on public health, neglecting &quot;population-based activities that offer efficient and effective approaches to improving the nation&#x27;s health.&quot; , about 3% of government health spending was directed to public health and prevention. This situation has been described as an &quot;uneven patchwork&quot; and &quot;chronic underfunding&quot;.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been seen as drawing attention to problems in the public health system in the United States and to a lack of understanding of public health and its important role as a common good.

<text>In Canada, a First Ministers&#x27; conference is a meeting of the provincial and territorial premiers and the Prime Minister. These events are held at the call of the prime minister. They are usually held in Ottawa.

Though known as &quot;First Ministers&#x27; conferences&quot; only since the 1960s, they ultimately trace their origin to the initial constitutional convention held in the mid-1860s at Charlottetown, PEI, then-capital of the British Province of Prince Edward Island. After confederation, two conferences of provincial premiers were held, in 1887 and 1902, in which the federal government was not represented.

Altogether, 76 First Ministers&#x27; conferences have been held since the first was convened by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1906, at the request of the provinces. Some important First Ministers&#x27; conferences were those leading up to the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords. The failed Charlottetown Accord contained a provision that would have made annual First Ministers&#x27; conferences obligatory.

The conferences are important for a number of reasons. A sizable portion of provincial funding (referred to as transfer payments) comes from the federal government, the conferences are an opportunity for the premiers to lobby for more money. Today it is common for the Premiers to meet beforehand to present a common front to the federal government. They are also important in that Canada&#x27;s federal system leaves a fair amount of overlap between federal and provincial jurisdictions and most large initiatives require some provincial support.

The vast majority of the activity at a First Ministers&#x27; conference takes place behind closed doors. A public statement is issued after the conference.

Formerly, the government leaders of the territories were only occasionally invited to these conferences, depending on whether issues especially relevant to the north are being discussed. Today, these leaders normally attend the meetings. The national chief of the Assembly of First Nations may also be invited to attend when issues especially relevant to First Nations communities are on the agenda; the group has lobbied for greater inclusion.

<text>Farbrausch, or Farb-rausch, is a German group of demomakers.

==Group==
The group became well known in the demoscene in December 2000 with a 64k intro called &quot;fr-08: .the .product&quot;. The demo achieved its small size through the use of procedural textures, a custom MIDI-based software synthesizer V2 (controlled through a sequencer called Logic Audio), and a modified version of UPX executable compressor, &quot;.the .product&quot; is an 11-minute 3-D show featuring complex scenes of computer generated imagery.

The name &quot;Farbrausch&quot; translates literally to &quot;color rush&quot;, where rush means variously &quot;intoxication, drunkenness, high, ecstasy, and state of euphoria.&quot; This serves as a core theme across the otherwise multifaceted topics in Farbrausch demos, which cover futuristic or abstract technology, dystopian cityscapes and even quantum mechanics.

Their work has won numerous awards. In 2004, a subdivision of farbrausch called &quot;.theprodukkt&quot; released a 96 kB first-person shooter game named &quot;.kkrieger&quot;, and an earlier version of the tool they currently use to produce some of their demos, named &quot;.werkkzeug&quot;, or &quot;Tool&quot;.

Farbrausch give their releases a &quot;product code&quot;, in the format &quot;fr-0#&quot;. The numbers do not specify the order of release — the members have stated that they allocate the numbers as they start working on the project, not when they finish it. Non-serious releases receive negative numbers.

The group has periodically released improved compositions such as &quot;fr-019: Poem to a Horse&quot;, &quot;fr-030: Candytron&quot; or &quot;fr-025: The.Popular.Demo&quot;. &quot;The.Popular.Demo&quot; and &quot;debris.&quot; are among the most highly favored demos on the demoscene index, Pouet. The.Popular.Demo also received the &quot;Public Choice Award&quot; from the 2003 scene.org awards, and &quot;debris.&quot; won the 2007 scene.org award for best direction.

In 2009, Farbrausch released &quot;.detuned&quot;, an interactive demo for the PlayStation 3, again under the name .theprodukkt.

In 2012 Farbrausch released the source code of many of their demo tools on GitHub.

<text>In cricket, an over consists of six legal deliveries bowled from one end of a cricket pitch to the player batting at the other end, almost always by a single bowler.

A maiden over is an over in which no runs are scored that count against the bowler (so leg byes and byes may be scored as they are not counted against the bowler). A wicket maiden is a maiden over in which a wicket is also taken. Similarly, double and triple wicket maidens are when two and three wickets are taken in a maiden over.

After six deliveries the umpire calls &#x27;over&#x27;; the fielding team switches ends, and a different bowler is selected to bowl from the opposite end. The captain of the fielding team decides which bowler will bowl any given over, and no bowler may bowl two overs in succession.

==Overview==
An over consists of six legal deliveries (although overs of different lengths have been used in the past, including four and eight). If the bowler bowls a wide or a no-ball, those deliveries are not counted towards the six-ball tally, and additional delivery must be bowled.

Because a bowler may not bowl consecutive overs, the usual tactic is for the captain to appoint two bowlers to bowl alternate overs from opposite ends. When a bowler tires or becomes ineffective, the captain will replace that bowler with another. The period of time during which a bowler bowls every alternate over is known as a &quot;spell&quot;.

If, during the middle of an over, a bowler is injured or is removed from the attack by the umpire for disciplinary reasons (such as bowling beamers), another bowler completes the remaining deliveries.

In limited overs cricket, bowlers are usually restricted in the total number of overs they may bowl in a match. The general rule is that no bowler can bowl more than 20% of the total overs in an innings; thus in a 50-over match each bowler can bowl a maximum of 10 overs.

In Test cricket and first-class cricket, there is no limit to the number of overs in a team&#x27;s innings, nor is there any limit to how many may be bowled by a single bowler. In these matches, there is a requirement to bowl a minimum of 90 overs in a day&#x27;s play, to ensure a good spectacle, and to prevent the fielding team from wasting time for tactical reasons.

==Tactical considerations==
===Tactical considerations in bowling overs===
The over is a fundamental consideration in the tactical planning of the fielding side. Since a single bowler has only six legal balls to bowl before they must hand the ball to another bowler, the bowler typically plans to use those six balls to set up a pattern of play designed to get a batting player out. For example, they may bowl the first few balls with the same line, length, or spin. The bowler intends to tempt the batting player into scoring runs by providing balls that are relatively easy to hit. If the batting player takes the bait, the bowler can then follow up with a variation designed to hit the wicket, or a ball that is intended to induce a mistake from a batting player who is still in aggressive run-scoring mode, which will result in the batting player being caught out.

Cricket imposes penalties if a team bowls its overs at a very slow over rate, such as fines, loss of competition points, and match bans. If a team is proceeding slowly, some captains will choose to use slow/spin bowlers. Such bowlers have a shorter run up so they complete their overs more quickly. Often this means choosing an inferior strategy by employing a less skilful bowler to avoid penalties that are perceived to be greater, such as being banned or losing points.

Bowling a maiden over in ODI and T20 forms of cricket can be difficult as the batting players seek to maximise their scoring opportunities and the rules have restricted field placements that help batters score more easily. If a 0 run over is achieved it can have significant impact on the tactical state of the game. The final overs in an innings are often described as the &quot;death overs&quot; or &quot;bowling at the death&quot;, with bowlers who are said to be particularly skilful at restricting scoring toward the end of an innings often called &quot;death bowlers&quot; in a similar fashion to closing pitchers in baseball. Players who are said to excel in this role include Indian Jasprit Bumrah, Australian Ian Harvey, South African Andrew Hall and New Zealand&#x27;s Daniel Vettori.

===Tactical considerations in batting===
If the two batting players are not similar, tactical considerations may affect their play. If one batting player is stronger than the other, they may attempt to engineer their scoring so that the stronger batting player faces the bowling more often. This is known as &quot;farming the strike&quot;. It may take the form of the stronger batting player trying to score an even number of runs on early balls in the over and an odd number on the last ball; the weaker batting player will attempt the reverse, and the bowler will try to disrupt this pattern.

If one batting player is right-handed and the other left-handed, they may try to score odd numbers of runs to disrupt the bowling pattern and tire the fielders by making them reposition themselves frequently.

==Historical number of balls per over in Test cricket==
Since 1979/80, all Test cricket has been played with six balls per over. However, overs in Test cricket originally had four balls per over, and there have been varying numbers of balls per over around the world up to 1979/80, generally the same as the number of balls per over in force in other first-class cricket in that country.

Prior to the Laws of Cricket (1980 Code), law 17.1 - Number of balls (in the over), did not explicitly specify the number of balls to be bowled in an over, but merely stated that the number of balls should be agreed by the two captains prior to the toss. In practice, the number of balls was usually stipulated in the playing regulations governing the match being played. Although six was the usual number of balls, it was not always the case. From the 1980 code onwards, law 17.1 was amended to read, &quot;The ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls&quot;.

<text>The Essex was a brand of automobile produced by the Essex Motor Company between 1918 and 1922, and by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan between 1922 and 1933.

==Corporate strategy==
During its production run, the Essex was considered a small car and was affordably priced. The Essex is generally credited with starting a trend away from open touring cars design toward enclosed passenger compartments.

Originally, the Essex was to be a product of the &quot;Essex Motor Company,&quot; which was a wholly owned entity of Hudson. Essex enjoyed immediate popularity following its 1919 introduction. Essex Motors went so far as to lease the Studebaker auto factory in Detroit for the production of the car. More than 1.13 million Essex automobiles were sold by the time the Essex name was retired in 1932 and replaced by the Terraplane. That year the Essex Motor Company was dissolved and the cars officially became a product of Hudson.

==Essex cars==
Essex cars were designed to be moderately priced cars which would be affordable to the average family. Proving durable, their capabilities were checked upon and confirmed by AAA and the United States Post Office. In 1919, an Essex completed a 50-hour, endurance test in Cincinnati, Ohio, at an average speed of . The early Essex cars also captured many hill climb records. In a special Essex race car, Glen Shultz won the 1923 Pikes Peak Hill Climb. It had a wheelbase.

Initially, Essex marketed a line of touring cars (open four-door cars with canvas tops), which was the most popular body style of cars in production at the time. While Essex added an enclosed sedan in 1920, it was the introduction of the 1922 closed coach, priced at $1,495 (US$ in dollars ), $300 above that of the touring car. By 1925, the coach was priced below the touring car. While Henry Ford is credited with inventing the affordable car, it was Essex that made the enclosed car affordable.

In 1928, the big news was the use of four-wheel mechanical brakes. Essex boasted &quot;piano hinge doors&quot; which were exceptionally strong. An advertisement shows a man fully supported by an open door to demonstrate the strength of the hinge.

1926 Specs
* Wheelbase = 
* Length = 
* Turning Radius = 
* Road Clearance = 
* Brakes = drums 

By 1929, the Essex was third in U.S. sales, behind Ford and Chevrolet.

Essex sales remained strong into 1931 before sales began to trend downward. For 1932 a redesigned Essex debuted and was named the Essex-Terraplane, a play on the word aeroplane. For 1934 the Essex name was dropped and the car was marketed as the Terraplane.

The instrument panel of the 1932 Hudson and Essex automobiles featured the first use of &quot;warning lights&quot; instead of gauges.

==International production==
Essex motor vehicles were either exported as complete cars or locally built from knock-down kits in many countries, making the Essex marque well known internationally as well as domestically. Essex vehicles were locally built in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

<doc id="463797" wikidata="Q594993" url="?curid=463797" title="Pinus flexilis">
<text>Pinus flexilis, the limber pine, is a species of pine tree in the family Pinaceae that occurs in the mountains of the Western United States, Mexico, and Canada. It is also called Rocky Mountain white pine.

A limber pine in Eagle Cap Wilderness, Oregon, has been documented as over 2,000 years old, and another one was confirmed at 1,140 years old. Another candidate for the oldest limber pine was identified in 2006 near the Alta Ski Area in Utah; called &quot;Twister&quot;, the tree was confirmed to be at least 1,700 years old and thought to be even older.

== Description ==
Its pliant branches gives it the common name &quot;limber&quot; and specific epithet &quot;flexilis&quot;. Its needles are about long and a dark, blueish green. Its bark is heavily creased and dark grey. Its pale wood is lightweight and soft.

&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot; is typically a high-elevation pine, often marking the tree line either on its own, or with whitebark pine (&quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot;), either of the bristlecone pines, or lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;). In favorable conditions, it makes a tree to , rarely tall. On exposed tree line sites, mature trees are much smaller, reaching heights of only . In steeply-sloping, rocky, and windswept terrain in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, limber pine is even more stunted, occurring in old stands where mature trees are consistently less than in height.

One of the world&#x27;s oldest living limber pine trees grows on the banks of the upper North Saskatchewan River at Whirlpool Point in Alberta.
Recent measurements give a maximum girth of 185&quot;. In 1986, a core sample 10 cm was retrieved by two researchers who counted 400 rings.
Extrapolating this data gives an age close to 3,000 years.

=== Similar species ===
&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot; is a member of the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, and like all members of that group, the leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. This distinguishes it from the lodgepole pine, with two needles per fascicle, and the bristlecone pines, which share five needles per fascicle but have a semi-persistent sheath.

==== &quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot; ====
Distinguishing limber pine from the related whitebark pine (&quot;P. albicaulis&quot;), also a white pine, is very much more difficult, and can only easily be done by the cones. In limber pine, the cones are long where the species overlap, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile. In whitebark pine, the cones are long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but are fragile and are pulled apart by birds to release the seeds. A useful clue is that whitebark pines almost never have intact old cones lying under them, whereas limber pines usually do.
==== &quot;Pinus monticola&quot; ====
In the absence of cones, limber pine can also be hard to tell from Western white pine (&quot;P. monticola&quot;) where they occur together in the northern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada east slope. The most useful clue here is that limber pine needles are entire (smooth when rubbed gently in both directions), whereas Western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Limber pine needles are also usually shorter, long, while western white pine needles are , though the ranges overlap.

== Distribution ==
The largest part of the limber pine&#x27;s range is in the Rocky Mountains, from southwest Alberta and southeastern British Columbia south through Colorado and New Mexico into the northern states of Mexico. It is also found through the Great Basin states of Nevada and Utah, in the eastern Sierra Nevada and White Mountains of Northern California, and in the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California. Continuing south the species is found in the San Jacinto Mountains, Santa Rosa Mountains, and Hot Springs Mountain of the Peninsular Ranges. There are small disjunct populations in eastern Oregon, in western North Dakota and Nebraska, and in the Black Hills of South Dakota. It is found at a wide range of altitudes depending on the latitude, from . In the northern half of its range, it grows in the montane zone near the lower tree line; in the middle of its range between the 45th and 40th parallels, it grows on windswept sites in the montane and subalpine zones; and in the southern part of its range, it grows mainly at high elevations in the subalpine zone near the upper tree line. It can more often be found at the outer fringes of a forest than in the forest itself.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot; is an important source of food for several species, including red squirrels and Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, the latter being an important distributor of seeds. There is evidence that limber pines co-evolved with Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, which are the primary dispersers of the seeds. In a relic, low elevation population, seeds are also dispersed by small rodents. American black bears and grizzly bears may raid squirrel caches for limber pine nuts. Squirrels, Northern flickers, and mountain bluebirds often nest in the trees. There is some evidence that &quot;P. flexilis&quot; has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that inhabit the needles.

The species is generally shade tolerant and resistant to fire, but does not thrive in dense habitats, instead occurring in areas relatively hostile to other species.

=== Threats ===
Limber pine is susceptible to white pine blister rust, caused by &quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;, a fungus that was introduced accidentally from Europe. Limber pine mortality is high in many areas throughout its range, except Arizona, where it has not yet been found. However, there is little hope of controlling the blister rust in existing trees. Research is under way, locating and breeding from the occasional naturally resistant limber pines, and by studying the resistance mechanisms of the European and Asian white pines (e.g. Swiss pine, Macedonian pine), which are strongly resistant to the disease.

The tree has also been damaged by bark beetle epidemics, particularly at drought-affected low elevations.

== Cultivation ==
The popular cultivar &quot;P. flexilis&quot; &#x27;Vanderwolf&#x27;s Pyramid&#x27; is widely available as an ornamental tree for gardens. &#x27;Vanderwolf&#x27;s Pyramid&#x27; derives from &quot;P. reflexa&quot;, though it is usually listed in nursery catalogs under &quot;P. flexilis&quot;.

The Southwestern white pine is popular as a windbreak tree or an ornamental tree due to its drought tolerance. It is also grown as a Christmas tree, liked for the soft needles but with stiffer branches than an Eastern white pine.

==Uses==
The large seeds are edible, and were reportedly consumed by Native Americans in Montana.

<doc id="463803" wikidata="Q1943396" url="?curid=463803" title="Isshin-ryū">
<text>is a style of Okinawan karate created by Tatsuo Shimabuku (島袋 龍夫) in approximately 1947/1948 (and named its present name on January 15, 1956). Isshin-Ryū karate is largely a synthesis of Shorin-ryū karate, Gojū-ryū karate, and kobudō. The name means, literally, &quot;one heart method&quot; (as in &quot;wholehearted&quot; or &quot;complete&quot;). In 1989 there were 336 branches of Isshin-ryū throughout the world (as recorded by the IWKA), most of which were concentrated in the United States.
== Kata ==
The system is summarized in its kata, and the specific techniques used to punch (vertical fist) and kick (snapping kicks) presented as upper and lower &#x27;charts&#x27;, most of which are thrown from natural stances and body posture. In many of the various forms of the system, sixteen kata (eight empty-hand, three bo, two sai, a bo-bo kumite kata, a bo-sai kumite kata and one tuifa kata) are agreed upon as composing Isshin-ryu. These kata include original developments of the Master, and inherited kata from the parent styles.

=== Empty-Hand Kata ===

==== Seisan ====
Tatsuo Shimabuku learned Seisan from his primary instructor, Chotoku Kyan. Previous to Kyan&#x27;s instruction, the Seisan form was a staple of local traditions.

This kata is sometimes the first introduced to students after the First and Second Charts of basics have been learned. This is in contrast to other Shorin systems where this kata is learned after other fundamental kata.

The Gojū-ryū curriculum includes a related version of Seisan, but Isshin-ryū Seisan was learned from Kyan, not Miyagi.

==== Seiunchin (制引戦) ====
The Seiunchin kata was brought into Isshin-ryū from Shimabuku&#x27;s studies with the Gojū-ryū founder, Chojun Miyagi. It is theorized by some Isshin-ryu researchers that this kata is an original composed by Miyagi, based on his experiences in Fuzhou, China. However, since this kata was also taught by Miyagi&#x27;s teacher, Kanryo Higaonna (1853-1915), and is included in other naha-te descended styles such as Shito-ryu, it is more likely that it was Higaonna who brought the kata back to Okinawa after his earlier studies in Fuzhou.

The kata focuses on the stance &quot;shiko-dachi&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;seiunchin-dachi&quot;), a low horse stance at which the knees are bent at obtuse angles and the feet are angled away from the direction the body is facing at 45-degree angles. The kata is broken into segments, each utilizing a specific breathing and muscle-tensing method. The kata has no obvious kicks, but one section contains hints of a rising knee strike.

==== Naihanchi (ナイハンチ) ====
Naihanchi [Shodan] comes to Isshin Ryu from studies with both Chotoku Kyan and Choki Motobu (a cousin of Kyan). It is also considered one of the staples of Ryukyu Ti, and is prevalent in most forms of Karate. The Isshin Ryu version is influenced heavily by the kumite of Motobu, with the exception of the turned-in toes (Motobu preferred the horse-riding stance with the toes in a neutral position).

The kata is also noted for its use of the &quot;Nami ashi&quot;, the returning wave kick. The kick has many different potentials for application, including the sweeping or redirecting of a low kick, a kick or knee to the inside of an opponent&#x27;s thigh, knee, tibia, and ankle. It also has the movement training potential for the basics of the sequential summation of movement. Some interpret the move as a low &quot;yoko-geri&quot; (side kick) from naihanchi-dachi to the opponent&#x27;s farthest ankle, inside-calf, or knee, and returning the kick to the body around the opponent&#x27;s nearest leg across one&#x27;s body to the hip and back down to naihanchi-stance.

A popular interpretation of the kata concerns its position: the entire sequence of moves in the kata is to be executed as if one is standing up against a wall and one&#x27;s opponents are to his left, right, and straight ahead. It is because of this that the kata is usually taught with the back straight and the heels and back placed firmly either on a straight edge such as a board or a wall, or on top of a long piece of tape.

The main stance of naihanchi is a slight variant from the Isshin Ryu stance &quot;kiba-dachi&quot;, in which both feet are shoulder-width apart facing forward. &quot;Naihanchi-dachi,&quot; as it&#x27;s called, takes kiba-dachi and turns the balls of the feet (area of foot just behind the toes) and turns them inward and accentuates the continuous bend at the knees Isshin Ryu Karateka are taught from initiation.

====Wansū (ワンシュー)====
Also coming from Kyan, Wanshū (also known as Wansu) has several iterations on the island of Ryukyu. Popular history has the kata coming from a Chinese political visitor who, during his duties, taught his fighting method in the open.

Isshin Ryu&#x27;s version of this form is unique for its inclusion of two side kicks - techniques seen in the system previously only in the Chart Two exercises. Current research hints at this change being made by Shimabuku Tatsuo himself.

For technical content, the form tends to focus on the slipping and in-close evasion and redirection of attack. It also contains a unique movement often described as a fireman&#x27;s carry throw, or dump. Because of this, many schools during the 1960s and 1970s nicknamed this kata &quot;the dumping form&quot;. Also, depending on the lineage, Wansu is one of two kata in Isshin Ryu which use the &quot;zenkutsu dachi&quot;, the longer front stance seen in other forms of karate.

==== Chinto ====
As with most of the kata in Isshin Ryu, Chinto comes from the teaching of Kyan.

The kata differs from others in that its embusen is a line placed on a 45-degree angle from the starting position, in the Kyan-style tradition. The footwork is indicative of a slipping, deflecting, and a whipping, relaxed body motion. Some karate instructors consider the previously learned forms of the system, Naihanchi and Wansu, to be preparatory and basic training forms, culminating in the kata Chinto.

====Kusanku (クーシャンク)====
Of the eight weaponless kata in Isshin-Ryu, five come from the teaching of Chotoku Kyan. Kusanku is one of these.

Kusanku is often referred to as a &quot;night-fighting&quot; kata, or a form which teaches fighting at night. The kata is set up in such a manner as to allow continual study of application potential from basic standing grappling and close striking in the beginning, to more aggressive and proactive techniques near the end. Its techniques may be utilized in places with low levels of light but is not exclusively a night fighting form.

Depending on the lineage, Kusanku is the second of two kata which contain the zenkutsu-dachi in Isshin-Ryu.

==== Sunsu ====
This kata was designed by the founder of Isshin-Ryu, Shimabuku Tatsuo, in approximately 1947. It incorporates several movements from other kata in the Isshin-Ryu syllabus, as well as from kata from other instructors, in addition to techniques and concepts Shimabuku favored. It was used as a dojo kata and as a personal project of the founder, prior to the naming of Isshin Ryu in 1956. Sunsu is rarely found outside of Isshin Ryu dojo. (Only the Shorin-ryu dojo of Nagamine Kojun in Uruma City, Okinawa is known to retain Sunsu to this day.)

The Okinawa Prefecture Karate Kobudo Rengokai has recognized Sunsu as a kata of Okinawa. This represents an acceptance of Isshin-Ryu as a traditional Ryukyu martial art.

====Sanchin (三戦)====
Coming from Miyagi Chojun, Sanchin has its origins in the Gojū-ryū system. Along with Seiunchin, this is one of two Gojū-ryū katas in Isshin-ryū. Previous to the instruction of Miyagi, the kata was practiced with open hands, turns, and natural breathing methods. With the founding of Gojū-ryū, this form was practiced with closed fists (a more traditional method on Okinawa), no turns, and a controlled, almost hard inhalation and exhalation.

Touted primarily for its physical training aspects, Sanchin also contains many applicable martial techniques.

Shimabuku also thought very highly of the form, saying once, &quot;Sanchin is for health. Without health, how can one have karate?&quot;

=== Bō Kata ===

==== Tokumine no Kun (sometimes referred to as Tokumeni no Kun)====
This bō form comes to the Isshin Ryu system from Shimabuku&#x27;s time with Chōtoku Kyan. Kyan is to have learned the form either from Tokumine himself, or from Tokumine&#x27;s landlord after the aforementioned had passed on. Shimabuku Tatsuo also commented that this was his favorite kata. Different isshin -ryu schools spell the name differently by changing the &quot;e&quot; and the &quot;i&quot;. Research thus far has shown that the kata was named after someone (Shitsunen Tokumine). However, at this time, no genealogical findings have been found for the spelling &quot;Tokumine&quot; while several are noted for &quot;Tokumeni&quot;. (Incorrect. The kanji and the katakana on the 1966 film of Tatsuo Shimabuku clearing shows it is TOKU MINE (pronounced Toe-koo-mee-nei)).

The spelling changes, and pronunciation conflicts, may have indeed come from the 1966 film of Tatsuo Shimabuku and which is readily viewable on YouTube at the time of this update. At timeline 12:38 there is a sign indicating the name of this staff kata. It is not written in kanji (the preferred method when writing a native Japanese name). It is written in both Romaji (romanized spelling for Japanese writing) and in Katakana (a simplified form of Kanji also used for foreign words and non-Japanese names). The Romaji is shown as &quot;TOKOMENI&quot; (noting the &quot;KO&quot; on the sign and the common replacement as &quot;KU&quot; throughout most Isshin-Ryu schools). Yet the Katakana below it was not consistent with how the romanized spelling should have been done. It should have been written in Romaji as &quot;TOKUMINE&quot;. The first katakana is definitely &quot;TO&quot;, the second &quot;KU&quot;, the third &quot;MI&quot;, the fourth is not clear but reasonably &quot;NE&quot; and together &quot;TOKUMINE&quot;.

==== Urashi no Kun (sometimes referred to as Urasoe no Kun) ====
The form Urashi no Kun was taught to Shimabuku by his kobudō instructor, Shinken Taira. Taira is the founder of the Ryūkyū Kobudō Hozon Shinkokai, whose goal is the preservation of Okinawa&#x27;s weapons forms.

==== Shishi no Kun (sometimes referred to as Sueyoshi no Kun) ====
Shimabuku learned this form from Shinken Taira who learned it from Kenwa Mabuni.

The kata itself uses the bo in a horizontal manner, different from other cudgel traditions.

=== Sai Kata ===

==== Kusanku Sai ====
This form is a product of Shimabuku&#x27;s own research into the art of kobudō, the coverall for Okinawa&#x27;s weapons studies.

The kata was built as an introduction to Sai practice, with the weapon movements replacing the empty-hand applications.

The form is taught one of two ways: with or without kicks. Initially, the kata was taught with kicks as it is a karate-based kata. Later, after 1960, the kicks were removed because Shimabuku wished to emphasize the weapon more so.

==== Chatan Yara no Sai ====
Chatan Yara is taught as the second Sai kata in the Isshin Ryu system, coming from Shimabuku&#x27;s instruction with Shinken Taira.

The form focuses on the development of the &quot;sequential summation of movement&quot;, which is the scientific term for full-body whipping motion. This is exemplified by the emphasis on whipping strikes, which make up a vast majority of the offensive movements in the form.

==== Kyan no Sai ====
This form comes either from Shimabuku&#x27;s studies of Sai methodology with Kyan, his primary karate instructor, or was possibly a form taught in its entirety. Shimabuku was teaching this kata in 1951 but by 1959 he had dropped in favor of Kusanku.

=== Tonfa Kata ===

==== Hamahiga no Tuifa ====
This form is from Shimabuku&#x27;s studies with Shinken Taira. It is the only Tonfa kata in the Isshinryu system. As do many Okinawans, Shimabuku always referred to the weapon, and thus the kata also, as tuifa.

Some Isshin-Ryu schools teach the kata in a different order. However, Shimabuku Tatsuo taught the kata in the above order.

== Other curriculum ==

=== Upper Body Basics ===
Developed by Tatsuo Shimabuku and one of his Okinawan students Eiko Kaneshi, the first chart (though some first-generation students learned this chart after the lower-body chart) of basic techniques is unique to the Isshin Ryu system.

Though the technical content and number of techniques varies by lineage, the first Chart One was simply a collection of 15 upper-body dominant techniques Shimabuku felt were necessary for proper development.

=== Lower Body Basics ===

Developed at the same time as the first chart, the second set of techniques are, largely, the basic kicking techniques of the Isshin Ryu system. As with the first chart, the number of techniques, as well as actual technical content, vary by lineage. The initial chart contained eight kicking techniques and six stretching and calisthenic exercises. A ninth kick was informally added to the chart in the late 1960s.

=== Kote-kitai ===

Kote-kitai is the Okinawan term for arm conditioning. Karada-kitai is the term for body conditioning with ashi-kitai for the feet, fukubu-kitai for the stomach, etc. It is not unique to Isshin Ryu, and is also used by other Okinawan styles such as Uechi-ryu.

===Makiwara (巻藁)===

As with the Kotekitai, the makiwara is a rather universal tool in Okinawan martial arts. It is made from an immovable punching post constructed of wood or some firm material, wrapped in straw or other soft padding.

The Makiwara is used primarily in the development of the striking surfaces utilized in karate. Unlike a hanging bag, timing, cadence, and footwork are rarely utilized with this implement, instead using it almost solely as a resistance training aide.

Striking of the makiwara tends to develop the muscles around the joints, strengthening them for the sometimes awkward or unorthodox strikes found in the various types of Ryukyu martial arts. The most common strikes used are straight punches using various hand formations and single, two, and three finger strikes.

===Kumite (組手)===

Kumite is the practice of free-sparring, that is, sparring in a non-set pattern. Shimabuku was one of the first, if not the first, Okinawan instructors to institute free-sparring using full Kendo armor to allow for full-contact training while minimizing the risk of injury. Current equipment makes free-sparring much easier and safer, allow for a more involved and effective karate training method.

Shimabuku also taught a series of 45 self-defense techniques, some devised from movements from the Isshin-ryu kata, some derived from kata that he did not include in the Isshin-ryu curriculum (presumably Gojushiho, Passai, and Ananku), and some derived from techniques that Shimabuku favored. Collectively, these techniques were listed in the dojo simply as &quot;Kumite&quot;, but some Isshin-ryu groups call them &quot;Shimabuku Tatsuo no Kumite&quot; (島袋龍夫の組手).

== History ==

=== Tatsuo Shimabuku ===

 (1908–1975) was born Shinkichi Shimabuku on September 19, 1908, in Gushikawa village, Okinawa. While &quot;The four most widely recognized of Tatsuo Shimabuku&#x27;s instructors are Chotoku Kyan, Choki Motobu, Chojun Miyagi, and Taira Shinken,&quot; his training history remains controversial, with one review finding his karate career &quot;riddled with historical inaccuracies, flaws, and unlikely scenarios.&quot; This review itself has been challenged by Andy Sloane, who claims to be a primary source for the article. Shimabuku began training under Shinko Ganeko (Okinawan: Ganiku), his maternal uncle. Ganeko later sent Shimabuku to study karate from Chotoku Kyan. Kyan served as Shimabuku&#x27;s principal instructor and seems to have been the most influential of Shimabuku&#x27;s teachers in shaping the Isshin-ryu style. The &quot;Classical Fighting Arts&quot; article questions this, noting that Eizo Shimabuku claimed that he and his brother Tatsuo were his students when they were young, then rhetorically asks why Eizo subsequently sent a senior student from their Isshin ryu dojo to learn Kyan&#x27;s distinctive forms. Nevertheless, the &quot;Shuri-Style Lineage Chart&quot; of the Okinawa Prefecture Board of Education lists Kyan as Shimabuku&#x27;s teacher. As Donnelly, author of several books on Isshin-ryu karate, suggests in reference to this chart, &quot;This is an indication that the Okinawan Kobudo Association only recognizes his [Shimabuku&#x27;s] Shorin-Ryu lineage and doesn&#x27;t feel that his time in Goju-Ryu is adequate to maintain that lineage. ... This is not to suggest that Master Shimabuku didn&#x27;t study Goju-Ryu, but that his study was not of a significant amount of time to be listed under that system.&quot; Chotoku Kyan would be his most influential instructor (and after whom he initially named his style &quot;Chan Mi Te&quot;, with Migwa being a reference to Chotoku Kyan&#x27;s nickname stemming from his wearing of glasses and his small eyes).

Bishop claimed he studied under Choki Motobu during the early 1940s in Naha; however, since Shimabuku was only present in Okinawa between 1941–42 and Motobu died in 1944, the &quot;Classical Fighting Arts&quot; article deems it &quot;difficult to understand&quot; how he could have trained with Motobu &quot;in any meaningful way.&quot; Bishop further cites Shimabuku having studied for various lengths of time with Chojun Miyagi, Choki Motobu, and Taira Shinken. The &quot;Classical Fighting Arts&quot; article claims that local sources list Shimabuku training for two months with Chojun Miyagi.

Shimabuku opened his first dojo in Konbu village and began teaching in late 1946 after being repatriated from Kyushu. Around this time, he adopted the name Tatsuo, or Dragon Man. He taught in Tairagawa village and also in Koza City before deciding to teach in his house in about 1948. On January 15, 1956, he held a meeting and announced that he was naming his new style of karate Isshin-ryu. Shimabuku&#x27;s number one student, Eiko Kaneshi, was at the meeting and asked Shimabuku, &quot;Why such a funny name?&quot; Tatsuo replied, &quot;Because all things begin with one.&quot;

At the age of 50 (c. 1959) Shimabuku began studying &quot;kobudō&quot;, the art of traditional Okinawan weapons, under Shinken Taira. &quot;Kobudō&quot; weapons included were the sai, bo, and tonfa. He incorporated the &quot;kobudō&quot; that he had learned from Kyan and Taira into the Isshin-ryu system.

=== Megami ===

, or for short, is the symbol of Isshin-ryu. It is represented on the Isshin-ryu crest and is often displayed on the front wall of the dojo next to a picture of Tatsuo Shimabuku. As an emblem for Isshin-ryū Tatsuo Shimabuku chose a half-sea-snake half-woman deity whom he had seen in a vision. She represents the strength of the snake and the quiet character of a woman, thus expressing the essence of the style.

Based on the &quot;ryuzu kannon&quot; (Chief Dragon deity of Japanese Buddhism), Originally the Isshin-ryu emblem was called &quot;Isshin-ryu No Megami&quot;, which means &#x27;Goddess of Isshinryu.&#x27; Some American Isshin-ryu also call it &quot;Mizu Gami&quot; (水神), translating to &quot;Water Goddess.&quot; Eiko Kaneshi, Tatsuo&#x27;s right-hand-man, who was a Shinto priest, was asked if it was &quot;Mizu Gami.&quot; He said it has nothing to do with water. &quot;Isshin-ryu no Megami&quot;, or &quot;Megami&quot; for short, is correct. This is corroborated by Marien Jumelet who asked Shinsho Shimabuku and Kensho Tokumura what was the correct name. &quot;Classical Fighting Arts&quot; contends that this misunderstanding results from &quot;erroneous information that appeared in a 1969 edition of &quot;Action Karate Magazine&quot;.&quot;

The Isshin-ryu patch is rich with cross-linked symbolism where certain features could and do have three or more intended meanings behind them. Between factions exist variations of the patch, the portrait of the Isshin-ryu no Megami, and the symbols contained therein.

The image represented at right is just one of the many versions of the Isshin-ryu no Megami. The ovular shape of the patch represents the characteristic vertical fist of Isshin-Ryu. The border of the patch is always a warm color—usually orange or yellow—and represents a ring of fire that appeared in Shimabuku&#x27;s vision. The Megami is allegedly a mother protecting her child; she is gentle like a mother, but fierce and threatening towards enemies who may harm her child. In this simplified version of the Isshin-ryu no Megami, one important symbol is left out; in the traditional patch depicts the goddess with a raised right fist and a lowered open palm. Her hands represent a well-known saying among karateka: &quot;fierce in battle and gentle in life.&quot; The small dragon above the goddess is a sea dragon of Oriental mythology, which was born at the bottom of the sea, but transformed by ascending to the heavens. The dragon is thought to represent Master Shimabuku. The rough seas and grey background depict a terrible typhoon, which represents the uncertainty of the future, and how trouble may arise spontaneously at any time. In relation to that, her calm face indicates that one must remain level-headed and calm in the face of adversity. Finally, the three stars at the top of the patch represent the three main teachers of Shimabuku (not including his weapons teacher). Each of these core symbols are depicted in each patch, regardless of how different they may seem to the untrained eye.

=== Notable Karateka of Shimabuku ===

==== Okinawan Karateka ====
* Kichiro Shimabuku (b. 1939), the eldest son of Tatsuo Shimabuku, inherited the Isshin-ryu dojo and leadership of the style upon his father&#x27;s passing on May 30, 1975. He took over full administration of the dojo in 1972 upon his father&#x27;s retirement. Shortly before his father&#x27;s death, he moved the dojo back to Kyan Village (present-day Kinaka) and renamed the organization the &quot;Isshin-Ryu World Karate Association&quot;.
*Shinsho Shimabuku (1942-c. 2004), younger son of Tatsuo Shimabuku, began training under his father in 1948.

He is the patriarch of the Armstrong-lineage, Robert Edwards is the current leader of the Armstrong lineage, and Deshaun D. Casey is recognized as the Custodian and or inheritor of the Armstrong Branch which was announced at the 2018 K.I.A.I grand national in south field Michigan, June 23, 2018, Willie Adams was a direct witness as well as many other notable Isshinryu practitioners. 
* Harold M. Mitchum (1933-2016) was Shimabuku&#x27;s first American student to attain the rank of Hachi-Dan. He has since earned the rank of Ju-Dan, and a space in the Isshin-Ryu Hall of Fame. He is the patriarch of the Mitchum-lineage.
* Eddie L. Johnson (Ed) (b. 1941) was one of Shimabuku&#x27;s students from December 1959 to February 1961. He was promoted to Sho-Dan while in Okinawa by Tatsuo Shimabuku in 1960. He was promoted to Kyu-Dan by Harold Mitchum in April 2005. He was later promoted to Ju-Dan by the Isshin-ryu Brotherhood in November 2005. In July 2019, Johnson was inducted into the Isshin-Ryu Hall of Fame. As of 2023, he still teaches in Fort Worth, Texas. 
* Arcenio James Advincula (b. 1938) is a martial artist and a first-generation student of the founder of Isshin-ryū Karate, Tatsuo Shimabuku.

== Features ==
Isshin-Ryu employs a vertical punch with the fingers tucked in and the thumb on top of the fist. Advantages vary with opinion, but it is usually taught that the thumb placement increases the stability of the wrist when punching, and that a vertical punch strikes with the same force at any range instead of at maximum extension as with a corkscrew style punch. Another advantage is that when punching, the thumb will not get caught on an object as opposed to having the thumb sticking up or out.

In Isshin-Ryu it is believed that the vertical punch is faster than the cork-screw punch: three vertical hand punches can be generated in the time of two cork-screw punches.

Isshin-Ryu arm blocks are performed today with the muscle at the intended contact point as opposed to other styles that block with the bone. By using the two bones and the muscle to form a block, less stress is created against the defender&#x27;s arm, increasing the ability to absorb a strike.

The original arm blocks were taught with palm up, wrist bent, to form a trapping motion as well as to block and/or strike with the radius bone.

Beginners in Isshin-ryu are taught to use their forearms to block in order to strengthen their forearms while working toward becoming a black belt. When one attains a black belt in Isshin-ryu they understand the purpose for the block is to use the knuckles on the inside of an attacker&#x27;s arm where are the soft tissue is emphasizing a hard strike to soft tissue. Therefore, there really are no blocks in Isshin-ryu.

Isshin-Ryu kicks are primarily a &quot;snapping&quot; motion, as opposed to placing primary emphasis on thrusting and follow-through. Furthermore, traditional Isshin-Ryu kicks are aimed almost entirely to the legs or groin—nothing above the belt. Competition kicks are aimed above the belt; however, these are largely meant to show one&#x27;s flexibility and balance and not intended for practical use.

<text>Arthur Christopher John Soames, Baron Soames, (12 October 1920 – 16 September 1987) was a British Conservative politician who served as a European Commissioner and the last Governor of Southern Rhodesia. He was previously Member of Parliament (MP) for Bedford from 1950 to 1966. He held several government posts and attained Cabinet rank.

== Early life and education ==

Soames was born in Penn, Buckinghamshire, England, the son of Captain Arthur Granville Soames (the brother of Olave Baden-Powell, World Chief Guide, both descendants of a brewing family who had joined the landed gentry) by his marriage to Hope Mary Woodbine Parish. His parents divorced while he was a boy, and his mother married her second husband Charles Rhys (later 8th Baron Dynevor), by whom she had further children including Richard Rhys, 9th Baron Dynevor.

Soames was educated at West Downs School, Eton College, and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He obtained a commission as an officer in the Coldstream Guards just before World War II broke out. During the war, he served in France, Italy, and North Africa and was awarded the French Croix de Guerre for his actions at the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942.

== Political career ==
After military service during the Second World War, Soames served as the Assistant Military Attaché in Paris. He was the Conservative MP for Bedford from 1950 to 1966 and served under Anthony Eden as Under-Secretary of State for Air from 1955 to 1957 and under Harold Macmillan as Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty from 1957 to 1958. In the 1955 Birthday Honours, he was invested as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

In 1958 he was sworn of the Privy Council. He served under Macmillan as Secretary of State for War (outside the Cabinet) from 1958 to 1960 and then in the cabinets of Macmillan and his successor Alec Douglas-Home as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from July 1960 to 1964. Home had promised to promote him to Foreign Secretary if the Conservatives won the 1964 general election, but they did not.

Between 1965 and 1966, Soames was Shadow Foreign Secretary under Edward Heath. He lost his seat in Parliament in the 1966 election. In 1968 Harold Wilson appointed him Ambassador to France, where he served until 1972. During his tenure as ambassador, he was involved in the February 1969 &quot;Soames affair&quot;, following a private meeting between Soames and French president Charles de Gaulle, the latter offering bilateral talks concerning a partnership for Britain in a larger and looser European union, the talks not involving other members. The British government eventually refused the offer, and that for a time strained Franco-British relations. He was then a Vice-President of the European Commission from 1973 to 1976. He was considered as a potential challenger to Edward Heath in the 1975 Conservative Party leadership election. The eventual winner Margaret Thatcher would have withdrawn if he had stood. He was created a life peer on 19 April 1978 as Baron Soames, of Fletching in the County of East Sussex.

He served as the interim governor of Southern Rhodesia from 1979 to 1980, charged with administering the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement and overseeing its governmental transition into Zimbabwe. From 1979 to 1981, he was Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords under Margaret Thatcher, concurrent with his duties in Southern Rhodesia.

== Outside politics ==
Soames served as president of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1973, was a non-executive director of N.M. Rothschild and Sons Ltd 1977–1979, and a director of the Nat West Bank 1978–1979.

== Personal life ==
Lord Soames married Mary Churchill, the youngest child of Winston and Clementine Churchill, on 11 February 1947. They had five children:

Lord Soames died from cancer at his home in Odiham on 16 September 1987. His ashes were buried within the Churchill plot at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire.

== Honours ==

* Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 (France) – 1942

<doc id="463810" wikidata="Q751123" url="?curid=463810" title="Lidzbark Warmiński">
<text>Lidzbark Warmiński (; , ), often shortened to Lidzbark, is a historical town located within the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It is the capital of Lidzbark County.

Lidzbark Warmiński was once the capital of Warmia and formerly its largest town. Lidzbark itself was a religious and cultural center, for which it was known as the &quot;Pearl of Warmia&quot;. For a long period of time it was under the control of the Warmian Bishops and it was also a major economic center, only resigning its importance to the nearby city of Braniewo.

The Warmian Bishop&#x27;s Castle is considered to be a great artistic and historical value in the world and has been recognised as a Historic Monument by the Polish government.

== History ==
The town was originally a settlement of Old Prussians known as &quot;Lecbarg&quot; until being conquered in 1240 by the Teutonic Knights, who named it Heilsberg. In 1306 it became the seat for the Bishopric of Warmia, and remained the Prince-Bishop&#x27;s seat for 500 years. In 1309 the settlement received town privileges. In the 1350s the Castle of Warmian Bishops was built, and it was expanded in the following centuries, becoming one of the most significant and remarkable historic monuments of Warmia, which nowadays houses a museum and is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland. In 1440 the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, upon the request of which in 1454 Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region and town to the Kingdom of Poland. This caused the Polish–Teutonic Thirteen Years&#x27; War, as a result of which in the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) the Teutonic Order ended its claim to the area and recognized it as part of Poland. It was the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia in the province of Royal Prussia in the larger Greater Poland Province.

Nicolaus Copernicus first visited the town at the turn of 1495 and 1496, and then lived at the castle from 1503. It is believed he wrote part of his &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; there.

In the winter of 1703–04 the town was the residence of King Charles XII of Sweden during the Great Northern War. In the mid-18th century a manuscript of the &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot;, the oldest medieval Polish chronicle was discovered in the castle by Prince-Bishop Adam Stanisław Grabowski, by whose decision it was then published in print for the first time.

The town was annexed with the rest of the region by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772. The town ceased to be the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, which was disestablished, however it remained the seat of the last Prince-Bishop Ignacy Krasicki until 1795, and afterwards the town lost its cultural significance, which it has not regained since. In 1807 a battle took place near the town between the French under Joachim Murat and Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult and the Russians and Prussians under Levin August, count von Bennigsen.

From 1933 to 1945 it was the site of the large German government radio station Transmitter Heilsberg. The town was heavily damaged after its conquest by the Soviet Red Army during World War II in 1945. After German surrender, sovereignty over the town was ceremoniously transferred to Polish authorities on May 19, 1945 by the Soviets.

As part of territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union, Polish rule was accepted at the Potsdam Conference, however, on preliminary terms. Germans were displaced and the town was gradually resettled by Poles, many of them from the parts of eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

<doc id="463812" wikidata="Q2926166" url="?curid=463812" title="Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company">
<text>The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was a public transit holding company formed in 1896 to acquire and consolidate railway lines in Brooklyn and Queens, New York City, United States. It was a prominent corporation and industry leader using the single-letter symbol B on the New York Stock Exchange. 

It operated both passenger and freight services on its rail rapid transit, elevated and subway network, making it unique among the three companies which built and operated subway lines in New York City. It became insolvent in 1919. It was restructured and released from bankruptcy as the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation in 1923.

==Consolidation==
The BRT was incorporated January 18, 1896, and took over the bankrupt Long Island Traction Company in early February acquiring the Brooklyn Heights Railroad and the lessee of the Brooklyn City Rail Road. It then acquired the Brooklyn, Queens County and Suburban Railroad leased on July 1, 1898.

The BRT took over the property of a number of surface railroads, the earliest of which, the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad or West End Line, opened for passenger service on October 9, 1863, between Fifth Avenue at 36th Street at the then border of Brooklyn City and Bath Beach in the Town of Gravesend, New York. A short piece of surface route of this railroad, near Coney Island Creek, is the oldest existing piece of rapid transit right-of-way in New York City, and in the U.S., having opened on June 8, 1864.

Initially the surface and elevated railroad lines ran on steam power. Between 1893 and 1900 the lines were converted to electricity operation. An exception was the service on the Brooklyn Bridge. Trains were operated by cables from 1883 to 1896, when they were converted to electric power
By 1900, it had acquired virtually all of the rapid transit and streetcar operations in its target area:
*Sea Beach Railway, acquired in November 1897
*Sea View Railroad (Coney Island Elevated), acquired in November 1897
*Nassau Electric Railroad (lessee of the Atlantic Avenue Railroad, Brooklyn, Bath and West End Railroad, Coney Island and Gravesend Railway, and South Brooklyn Railway), acquired in November 1898 and leased to the BHRR in April 1899
*Brooklyn Elevated Railroad, acquired in March 1899 and leased to the BHRR in April 1899
*Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad (Brighton Beach Line), acquired in March 1899
*Kings County Elevated Railroad (Fulton Street Line), acquired in November 1899 and merged into the Brooklyn Union Elevated on May 24, 1900
*Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad (Culver Line), leased to the BHRR on June 18, 1899

Only the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad and the short Van Brunt Street and Erie Basin Railroad remained independent; the former was acquired in 1913 or 1914.

==Expansion==
BRT opened its first short subway segment, consisting only of an underground terminal at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge at Delancey and Essex Streets in Manhattan on June 16, 1908. This line was extended under Delancey Street and Centre Street to a new five-platform complex at Chambers Street beneath the Manhattan Municipal Building at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge on August 4, 1913. In addition to BRT trains, Long Island Railroad (LIRR) commuter trains also used the new Chambers Street station from its opening until 1917. The elevated railroads were operated by a new corporation, the New York Consolidated Railroad.

In 1913, the BRT, through another subsidiary, the New York Municipal Railway, signed the Dual Contracts with the government of New York City, to construct and operate new subways and other rapid transit lines to be built or improved under these contracts. Almost all subsequent BRT lines were built as part of the contracts. The BRT opened its first Brooklyn subway under Fourth Avenue on June 22, 1915, running over the Manhattan Bridge to a junction with the aforementioned Nassau Street Line at Canal Street. The BRT opened the first segment of its Manhattan main line subway, the Broadway Line, as far as 14th Street–Union Square on September 4, 1917. The Broadway Line was completed in 1920. The BRT&#x27;s only crosstown Manhattan line, the Canarsie Line, opened in 1924.

During the beginning of the BRT&#x27;s existence, the LIRR was a competitor of the BRT for passengers in Brooklyn and Queens. Despite competing with nearby lines, the BRT and its predecessors also hosted LIRR passenger trains via track sharing agreements and interchanged freight with them. LIRR Passenger service to the BRT&#x27;s Brooklyn Bridge terminal began after an agreement in 1895, utilizing BRT elevated lines. LIRR passenger service to downtown Manhattan via the BRT subway and Williamsburg Bridge began with the opening of the Chambers Street Station. Both LIRR and BRT motorman were represented by the same union. Today, BRT successor MTA New York City Transit still receives freight deliveries from LIRR freight successor the New York &amp; Atlantic Railroad in Sunset Park and at Linden Yard.

==Demise and legacy==
World War I and the attendant massive inflation associated with the war put New York transit operators in a tough position, since their contracts with the City required a five-cent fare be charged, while inflation made the real value of the fare less than three cents in constant currency value. On November 1, 1918, the Malbone Street wreck, the second worst rapid transit train wreck to occur in the United States, occurred on the BRT&#x27;s Franklin Avenue/Brighton Beach line, killing at least 93 people. This further destabilized the financially struggling company, and the BRT filed bankruptcy on December 31, 1918. In 1923 the BRT was restructured and released from bankruptcy as the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT).

Some of the former elevated system of the BRT, dating to 1885, remains in use today. The largest section is the part of today&#x27;s BMT Jamaica Line running above Fulton Street from the Alabama Avenue station to a small section turning north after the Crescent Street station. Most of the other surviving structures were either built new or rehabilitated between 1915 and 1922 as part of the Dual Contracts. One piece of structure – the elevated portion of the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, built in 1896 and 1905 – was extensively rebuilt in 1999.

Several BRT-era equipment have been preserved. This includes nine BU cars and five AB Standard cars, all which were also operated by the BMT upon the company&#x27;s creation in 1923.

<text>&quot; or &quot; (Forward, Flag of Glory) is the anthem of Slovene nation, written in 1860, and was briefly used as the national anthem of SR Slovenia until 1989. It is now used as the official service song of the Slovenian Armed Forces.

==Lyrics and music==
It tells about a boy who goes to defend his homeland, meaning him more than his mother or sweetheart. As such, it is a patriotic recruiting poem. It was the first Slovene literature to be translated into English. The lyrics were written originally by Simon Jenko and then improved collaboratively by him and his cousin Davorin Jenko who also wrote the music. The poem was first publicly sung with great success in front of a large Slavic audience on 22 October 1860, and was first published in () on 1 December 1860. In 1863, it was renamed by Radoslav Razlag to . In 1885, it became the first poem in Slovene to have been translated into English, under the title &quot;With Slava&#x27;s Banner, Forward!&quot; The translators were Andrej Jurtela, the first lecturer of Slavic languages at the University of Oxford, and English journalist Alfred Lloyd Hardy, who had a keen interest in music and in Slavic culture. He arranged the melody by Davorin Jenko for piano, wrote an interlinear translation and published it lithographed as an independent publication.

The poem was originally titled &quot;Naprej&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot;) and set to music in an inn in Vienna&#x27;s Prater by Davorin Jenko, who was in anger over the German snub of the Slovene, on 16 May 1860.

==History==
===Part of the national anthem of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia===
After the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, the first and the last stanza of the poem were included into the Yugoslav national anthem as its third part, in a medley including the Serb ethnic anthem &quot; and the Croatian song &quot;. Even before, during the fight for the northern border, the poem was sung by the Maister&#x27;s soldiers in November 1918.

===Slovene Partisans and Territorial Defence===
In World War II, &quot;&quot; was the introductory melody of the Kričač radio station, emitted by the Slovene Liberation Front, and was a part of the morning and the evening salutation to the flag by the Slovene Partisans. With the establishment of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946, the royal Yugoslav anthem was replaced by &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot;. The first post-war constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of Slovenia and the constitution, adopted in 1963, did not specify a regional anthem. &quot;Naprej, zastava slave&quot; was used at official public events and on state holidays since the beginning of the 1970s. In 1989, it was replaced by &quot;&quot;.

Because it calls to the defence of the homeland, it was since 1992 played during ceremonial events and oathtaking ceremonies in the Slovenian Territorial Defence in line with the draft &quot;Rules on Service in the Territorial Defence&quot;, adopted on 15 April 1992.

==Current role==
It is the current anthem of the Slovenian Armed Forces, based on a government decree from 1995. It is also played (only rarely sung) for the Commander-in-Chief, i.e. the President of Slovenia. The President has, however, the right to delegate this position to another Slovenian citizen.

<doc id="463819" wikidata="Q254110" url="?curid=463819" title="Fernando Sor">
<text>Fernando Sor (baptised 14 February 1778 – 10 July 1839) was a Spanish classical guitarist and composer of the late Classical era and early Romantic era. Best known for writing solo classical guitar music, he also composed an opera (at the age of 19), three symphonies, guitar duos, piano music, songs, a Mass, and at least two successful ballets: &quot;Cinderella&quot;, which received over one hundred performances, and &quot;Hercule et Omphale&quot;.

Partly because Sor was himself such a classical guitar virtuoso—contemporaries considered him to be the best in the world—he made a point of writing didactic music for players of that instrument of all levels. His Twelve Studies Op. 6, the Twelve Studies Op. 29, the (24) Progressive Lessons Op. 31, and the (24) Very Easy Exercises Op. 35 have been widely played for two hundred years and are regularly reprinted. On the other hand, some of Sor&#x27;s music, not least his popular &quot;Introduction and Variations on Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Das klinget so herrlich&quot;&quot; Op. 9, is fiendishly difficult.

Unlike modern classical guitar players, Sor used the smaller, slimmer &quot;Romantic&quot; guitars predating today&#x27;s familiar Torres instrument. He used the ring finger of his plucking hand &quot;rarely&quot; and &quot;only for harmony (never for melody).&quot; He eschewed the use of nails on that hand.

== Variance of name ==
As Sor&#x27;s works were published in various countries, his name was translated, leading to variances in its spelling. These included Joseph Fernando Macario Sors, Ferdinand Sor, Ferdinando Sor and, in the last years, Ferran Sor. His family name appears in various forms in other contemporary documents as well, and there is not always a record of his having approved or used them. But in the file and marriage certificate of his grandfather, which includes Fernando&#x27;s great-grandfathers, the name always appears as Sor, and this is true too of the corresponding document for one of the great-grandfathers, the oldest document yet found.

==Biography==

===Spain===
Born in Barcelona to a fairly well-off family, he was baptized as José Fernando Macario Sors, as recorded in the baptismal record, although in most of his manuscript and printed musical works he appears as Fernando Sor or Ferdinand Sor, and only in some cases does his surname appear as Sors.

Sor was descended from a long line of career soldiers and intended to continue that legacy, but was distracted from this when his father introduced him to Italian opera. He fell in love with music and abandoned his military ambitions. Along with opera, Sor&#x27;s father also introduced him to the guitar.

 At a young age, Sor&#x27;s parents wouldn&#x27;t give his musical abilities too much special attention, for fear it would distract from his Latin studies. Therefore, the young Sor (still not 11 years old) began to write songs to words in Latin to impress his parents. He even invented his own system for notating music, as he had not yet received formal training.

When he reached the age of 11 or 12, the head of the Barcelona Cathedral took notice of young Sor&#x27;s talent, and he was enrolled in the school there. Not long after, his father died, leaving his mother without the funds to continue his education at the Cathedral. However, at around the same time Joseph Arredondo, the new abbot of Santa Maria de Montserrat, the famous monastery, heard of his talent, and provided funds for him to attend the choir school located at the monastery. Sor reveals in writings, mainly from the last ten years of his life, that he was greatly attached to this place, and had fond, nostalgic memories of his childhood there. But his mother began to see that Sor was becoming greatly distracted from his &quot;chosen&quot; path in the military or administration and, following the advice of friends, took him out of the monastery and placed him in military school for four years. It was not a terrible turn of events, as he had much free time to play and compose music in the army as well.

In 1808, when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain, Sor began to write nationalistic music for the guitar, often accompanied by patriotic lyrics. Sor was even part of traveling military bands that would play protest music on the streets. He was also promoted to captain in Córdoba and may have fought battles against the French at this time. After the defeat of the Spanish army, however, Sor accepted an administrative post in the occupying government. Here he was to be officially labeled an afrancesado along with the other Spaniards who abandoned their defense of Spain to embrace the French Revolutionary ideas. After the Spanish repelled the French in 1813, Sor and other afrancesados left Spain for fear of retribution. He went to Paris, never to return to his home country again.

===Paris, London, and Moscow===

Having abandoned his family&#x27;s ideal of a military or administrative post, Sor could finally give music a serious try in France. He gained renown at first as a virtuoso guitarist and composer for the instrument. When he attempted composing operas, however, he was rejected by the French. His Op. 7 was a large and strange piece, notated in three clefs, and no guitarist at the time could play it. Since France was no longer supportive of his music, Sor decided to try his talents elsewhere.

In 1815, he went to London to attempt to build a stronger music career there. Again, he gained considerable fame as a classical guitarist and gave guitar and voice lessons. Since ballet in London was more popular than opera, Sor decided to try his hand at this new genre of music. He had considerable success this time, especially with his ballet &quot;Cendrillon&quot;.

By 1823, once he had acquired a level of fame in London, Sor again wandered away, this time with his wife, the ballerina Félicité Hullin, to Moscow in her quest to become a prima ballerina. Not much is known about his time there, however, despite the exaggeration about his romantic and professional life. After three years in Moscow, he traveled around Europe giving concerts and getting into music circles everywhere he went.

In 1827, partly due to his advancing age, he settled down and decided to live out the rest of his life back in Paris. It was during this retirement that he composed the majority of his classical guitar works. He had to comply with the demands of the public, though, and most guitarists wanted technically simple, nice-sounding pieces. It was in these last ten or so years of his life that his writings reveal his bitterness towards how his publications were being received by the public. For example, Op. 43 is entitled &quot;Mes Ennuis&quot; (&quot;My Annoyances&quot;), and six of his ballets are dedicated to &quot;whoever wants them&quot;. These and other caustic remarks did not help his sales in the least. The foreword to Op. 45 goes even further than sarcasm: &quot;Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s that. Six short and easy pieces in stages, which aim to lead to what has generally been agreed are difficulties. Composed and dedicated to the person with the least patience, by Fernando Sor. Opus 45.&quot;

His last work was a mass in honour of his daughter, who died in 1837. The event sent the already sickly Sor into serious depression, and he died in 1839, of tongue and throat cancer.

==Quotations==
François-Joseph Fétis has called him &quot;le Beethoven de la guitare&quot;, though he has also remarked that Sor had failed to produce a good tone on one occasion.



==Works==

===Music===

One of Sor&#x27;s popular compositions is his &quot;Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart&quot;, Op. 9. It is based on the melody for &quot;Das klinget so herrlich, das klinget so schön!&quot; from &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, composed in 1791.

===Didactic music===
Sor was a prolific and, in his time, quite popular composer. There was a great demand for him to compose material that was approachable by less accomplished players. The resulting body of instructional studies he produced is not only noteworthy for its value to students of the guitar, but for its inherent musicality. Much of this work is organized in several opus numbers (in increasing order of difficulty): Op. 60 (25 lessons), Op. 44 (24 lessons), Op. 35 (24 exercises), Op. 31 (24 lessons), Op. 6 (12 studies) and Op. 29 (12 studies).

===Didactic manual===
Sor&#x27;s &quot;Méthode pour la Guitare&quot; was first published in Paris in 1830 and translated into English by A Merrick in 1832 under the title &quot;Method for the Spanish Guitar&quot;.
==Instruments used by Sor==
Sor undoubtedly played guitars by Pierre René Lacôte, mentioning: &quot;M. Lacote, a French maker, the only person who, besides his talents, has proved to me that he possesses the quality of not being inflexible to reasoning&quot;.
Some guitars of Lacôte show Sor&#x27;s signature: &quot;Fernando Sor, the Catalan man was out of his mind in Paris has signed a number of guitars by René Lacôte – examples now survive in the Edinburgh University Collection of Historic Musical Instruments, cat. no. 2521; and in private ownership (exhibited at the Londen Early Music Instrument Makers Exhibition, 1991). Sor also lent his name to the instruments of Louis Panormo of London. However, in neither case is the instrument known, then or now, as a &#x27;Sor model&#x27;.&quot;
A guitar of Lacôte that was signed by Sor is displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art: 1. In his method, Sor mentions: &quot;[...] if I wanted an instrument, I would procure it from M. Joseph Martinez of Malaga, or from M. Lacote [...]The guitars to which I have always given the preference are those of Alonzo of Madrid, Pagès and Benediz of Cadiz, Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga, or Rada, successor and scholar of the latter, and those of M. Lacote of Paris. I do not say that others do not exist; but never having tried them, I cannot decide on that which I have no knowledge.&quot; In his method, he also mentions that &quot;J. Panormo&quot; of London and &quot;Mr. Schroeder of Petersburgh&quot;, made some guitars under his direction; but it is curious that he mentions them only in regard to his own guitar design ideas, which are today partly critically viewed. Guitars made according to Sor&#x27;s design have not yet been located.

<text>Adam Greenfield is an American writer and urbanist, based in London.

==Early life==
Greenfield was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1968. He attended New York University, graduating with a degree in cultural studies in 1989. Between 1995 and 2000, he served as a psychological operations specialist (later sergeant) in the United States Army’s Special Operations Command.

==Career==
After leaving the Army, Greenfield began working in the then-nascent field of information architecture for the World Wide Web, holding a succession of positions culminating in employment at the Tokyo office of Razorfish, where he was head of information architecture.

In the 2006 and 2007 academic years, with Kevin Slavin, he co-taught a class at New York University&#x27;s Interactive Telecommunications Program called Urban Computing. In the following academic year the class was renamed Urban Experience in the Network Age, and Greenfield taught it alone. From 2008 to 2010 he was Nokia&#x27;s head of design direction for user interface and services, residing in Helsinki throughout the assignment. In 2010 he returned to New York City and founded an urban-systems design practice called Urbanscale, which described their work as &quot;design for networked cities and citizens.&quot;

In September 2013, Greenfield was awarded the inaugural Senior Urban Fellowship at the LSE Cities centre of the London School of Economics, relocated to London, and taught in the MArch Urban Design programme at the Bartlett School of Architecture of University College London.

He has written a number of articles for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, beginning in 2014.

<text>SSD (Society System Decontrol) was a straight edge hardcore band from Boston. They released two records as SS Decontrol and then formally changed their name to SSD. As SSD they released two more records with a heavy metal influenced sound. However, the group is often simply referred to, including all its periods, as SSD.

==History==
Formed by songwriter/guitarist Al Barile (then a machinist at the General Electric plant in Lynn, Massachusetts and a student at Northeastern University), SSD started performing at smaller venues throughout the Greater Boston metropolitan area, like Gallery East, in the summer of 1981. The band quickly gained notoriety within the local music scene for intense, charged performances and the provocative antics of their core group of followers, the Boston Crew.

The original lineup was Al Barile on guitar, Springa (David Spring) on vocals, Jaime Sciarappa on bass and Chris Foley on drums. They released their debut LP &quot;The Kids Will Have Their Say&quot; on their own X-Claim label in 1982. Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat was a friend and supporter and his Dischord label&#x27;s logo appeared on the back cover.

In 1983 they added second guitarist Francois Levesque and released the EP &quot;Get It Away&quot;, widely regarded as their best record, and one that helped define Boston&#x27;s straight-edge scene. The X-Claim pressings of it and &quot;The Kids Will Have Their Say&quot; are both highly collectable.

Like many hardcore bands in the mid-1980s, particularly in the Boston area, SSD began heading in a heavy metal direction. In 1984 they signed to the Boston label Modern Method and released the &quot;How We Rock&quot; EP, which was rooted in the hardcore sound but exhibited overt heavy metal characteristics, such as a relatively high number of lengthy guitar solos. After signing to Homestead they released the &quot;Break It Up&quot; LP in 1985 which saw the band expand further into the metal genre, leaving behind all trappings of punk and hardcore. SSD broke up in November that year.

Barile went on to form Gage, Sciarappa joined Slapshot, and Springa went on to join Razorcaine and Die Blitzkinder. 

Scott Schinder, in his book &quot;Alt-Rock-a-Rama&quot;, described SSD as &quot;The most important hardcore band to emerge from New England.&quot;

<doc id="463823" wikidata="Q2818867" url="?curid=463823" title="A-Train III">
<text>A-Train III, known internationally as A-Train, is a 1990 computer game, is the third game in the A-Train series. It was originally developed and published by Japanese game developer Artdink for Japan, and was later published by Maxis for the United States.

==Overview==
The game places players in command of a railway company. There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the city and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to use of near-isometric dimetric projection to present the city, similar to Maxis&#x27;s &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.

There are two types of transport that the player&#x27;s company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow.

Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.

As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.

==Editor==
A.III. MAP CONSTRUCTION, known internationally as A-Train Construction Set, is an editor that can change existing saved games, or to build landscapes from scratch. It comes with 6 sample maps.

Maxis also published A-Train Construction Set with A-Train as a single package in Europe, without the Ocean Software label.

==Windows version==
Artdink ported the A-Train III along with the editor to Windows 95, and published both titles as a package as the 3rd ARTDINK BEST CHOICE title in Japan.

== Maxis distribution and ports ==
The game was tremendously popular in Japan, thus motivating Maxis to license it for US distribution as &quot;A-Train&quot;, available for DOS, Macintosh and Amiga platforms. It was released in October, 1992, though it sold poorly.

Even the release of an add-on pack for the game failed to stir up any real support amongst the gaming community. The game was the first major failure from Maxis.

In spite of the PC version&#x27;s commercial failure in the US, Maxis later released a PlayStation version in 1996, based on Artdink&#x27;s &quot;AIV: Evolution Global&quot;. The PlayStation was a relatively new platform at that point and the game suffered many limitations, such as requiring an entire memory card (expensive at the time) to store a single map. Like the PC version, it proved unsuccessful.

== Economic Model ==
A-Train contains a very challenging economic system that includes a 5% land tax on all property owned, and a 50% income tax. The economic model however fails to capture realistic land prices, which adds a major flaw to the games design. Certain buildings the AI is not allowed to build, such as the Amusement Park, Golf Course, and stadium. These buildings cost a relatively similar price no matter where they are placed, however, if placed in a thriving city, they can be sold for up to $6mil. This bug completely circumvents the difficulty inherent in the highly restrictive economic model.

== Sequels ==
In later years, development of the series continued on both console and PC platforms. &quot;A5&quot;, released for PlayStation and PC in 1997, introduced a totally 3D environment. &quot;A6&quot;, the first game in the series for PlayStation 2, was released in Japan in 2000 and later translated to English and released in Europe as &quot;A6: A-Train 6&quot; by Midas Interactive Entertainment in 2004. &quot;A Ressha de Ikou 2001&quot;, a new version of &quot;A6&quot; with online support, was released for PS2 in 2001 and followed by several expansion packs.

The most recently released game in the core series, &quot;A7&quot;, was released in 2005 for Windows-based PCs in Japanese. A Traditional Chinese translation was released in July 2006. However, the Chinese version does not include the original Japanese train, and some unrealistic fiction trains are added. &quot;A7&quot; is advertised as an homage to the 10th anniversary of &quot;AIV&quot; and uses a trimetric interface, instead of the open 3D interface of &quot;A5&quot; and &quot;A6&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s reviewer Stanley Trevena stated in 1992 that while he enjoyed the financial and management aspects of &quot;A-Train&quot;, &quot;many people will miss out on a fine program because of a steeply graded learning curve&quot;.

The game was reviewed in 1992 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #187 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. In 1993 the game received a Codie award from the Software Publishers Association for Best Strategy Program. &quot;A-Train&quot;&#x27;s isometric, tile-based graphics and animated elements inspired the visual style Maxis went on to adopt for &quot;Simcity 2000&quot; in 1993.

In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named &quot;A-Train III&quot; the 46th best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, &quot;Fascinating, absorbing and now quite cheap, &quot;A-Train&quot; is worth a place in any games collection — and don&#x27;t be put off by the subject matter. It&#x27;s brilliant fun.&quot;

<doc id="463824" wikidata="Q2746153" url="?curid=463824" title="Pinus strobiformis">
<text>Pinus strobiformis, also known as Chihuahua white pine, is a medium-sized white pine tree endemic to western Mexico in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range. It is typically a high-elevation pine growing mixed with other conifers in montane forest. It was formerly considered conspecific with &quot;Pinus reflexa&quot; (southwestern white pine) of the southwestern United States and &quot;Pinus stylesii&quot; of northeastern Mexico, but is now treated as distinct from these.

==Description==

&quot;Pinus strobiformis&quot;, a member of the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, is a straight, slender tree growing to (rarely ) tall and in diameter. The bark is smooth and silvery-grey on young trees, aging to furrowed and red-brown or dark grey-brown. The branches are spreading and ascending. The twigs are slender, pale red-brown, aging to smooth grey or grey-brown. The buds are ellipsoid, red-brown, and resinous. The leaves (needles) are five per bundle (fascicle), spreading, 8–14 cm long, 0.6-1.0 mm in diameter, straight, slightly twisted, pliant, dark green to blue-green, and persist 3–5 years. The upper surfaces (adaxial, facing the centre of the fascicle) is conspicuously whitened by narrow stomatal lines. The lower surfaces (abaxial, the outer face away from the centre of the leaf fascicle) are without evident stomatal lines. The margins are sharp, razorlike and finely serrulate, apex narrowly acute to short-subulate. Each fascicle has a deciduous sheath 1.5-2.0 cm long which is shed early.

The cones are very large, 16–50 cm long and 9–11 cm broad, and have scales with a very characteristic prolonged and often recurved or S-shaped apex. The seeds are large, and with a very short wing; they are dispersed mainly by birds, particularly the Mexican jay.

==Distribution==
It is native to Mexico in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains, from a short distance south of the US–Mexico border south through Chihuahua and Durango to Jalisco. The pine rarely appears in pure strands, but grows along with other native conifers, such as Durango pine &quot;Pinus durangensis&quot;, Arizona pine &quot;Pinus arizonica&quot;, American aspen &quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;, Durango fir &quot;Abies durangensis&quot;, Douglas-fir &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;, and the Mexican subspecies of Engelmann&#x27;s spruce &quot;Picea engelmannii&quot; subsp. &quot;mexicana&quot;. It is a drought tolerant tree but greater populations grow on moist and cool places living in association with other pines.

<doc id="463835" wikidata="Q601319" url="?curid=463835" title="Life on Mars">
<text>The possibility of life on Mars is a subject of interest in astrobiology due to the planet&#x27;s proximity and similarities to Earth. To date, no conclusive evidence of past or present life has been found on Mars. Cumulative evidence suggests that during the ancient Noachian time period, the surface environment of Mars had liquid water and may have been habitable for microorganisms, but habitable conditions do not necessarily indicate life.

Scientific searches for evidence of life began in the 19th century and continue today via telescopic investigations and deployed probes, searching for water, chemical biosignatures in the soil and rocks at the planet&#x27;s surface, and biomarker gases in the atmosphere.

Mars is of particular interest for the study of the origins of life because of its similarity to the early Earth. This is especially true since Mars has a cold climate and lacks plate tectonics or continental drift, so it has remained almost unchanged since the end of the Hesperian period. At least two-thirds of Mars&#x27; surface is more than 3.5 billion years old, and it could have been habitable 4.48 billion years ago, 500 million years before the earliest known Earth lifeforms; Mars may thus hold the best record of the prebiotic conditions leading to life, even if life does not or has never existed there.

Following the confirmation of the past existence of surface liquid water, the &quot;Curiosity&quot;, &quot;Perseverance&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; rovers started searching for evidence of past life, including a past biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic, or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, fossils, and organic compounds on Mars is now a primary objective for space agencies.

The discovery of organic compounds inside sedimentary rocks and of boron on Mars are of interest as they are precursors for prebiotic chemistry. Such findings, along with previous discoveries that liquid water was clearly present on ancient Mars, further supports the possible early habitability of Gale Crater on Mars. Currently, the surface of Mars is bathed with ionizing radiation, and Martian soil is rich in perchlorates toxic to microorganisms. Therefore, the consensus is that if life exists—or existed—on Mars, it could be found or is best preserved in the subsurface, away from present-day harsh surface processes.

In June 2018, NASA announced the detection of seasonal variation of methane levels on Mars. Methane could be produced by microorganisms or by geological means. The European ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter started mapping the atmospheric methane in April 2018, and the 2022 ExoMars rover &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; was planned to drill and analyze subsurface samples before the programme&#x27;s indefinite suspension, while the NASA Mars 2020 rover &quot;Perseverance&quot;, having landed successfully, will cache dozens of drill samples for their potential transport to Earth laboratories in the late 2020s or 2030s. As of February 8, 2021, an updated status of studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus (via phosphine) and Mars (via methane) was reported. In October 2024, NASA announced that it may be possible for photosynthesis to occur within dusty water ice exposed in the mid-latitude regions of Mars.

==Early speculation==

Mars&#x27;s polar ice caps were discovered in the mid-17th century. In the late 18th century, William Herschel proved they grow and shrink alternately, in the summer and winter of each hemisphere. By the mid-19th century, astronomers knew that Mars had certain other similarities to Earth, for example that the length of a day on Mars was almost the same as a day on Earth. They also knew that its axial tilt was similar to Earth&#x27;s, which meant it experienced seasons just as Earth does—but of nearly double the length owing to its much longer year. These observations led to increasing speculation that the darker albedo features were water and the brighter ones were land, whence followed speculation on whether Mars may be inhabited by some form of life.

In 1854, William Whewell, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, theorized that Mars had seas, land and possibly life forms. Speculation about life on Mars exploded in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation by some observers of apparent Martian canals—which were later found to be optical illusions. Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer Percival Lowell published his book &quot;Mars,&quot; followed by &quot;Mars and its Canals&quot; in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization. This idea led British writer H. G. Wells to write &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet&#x27;s desiccation.

The 1907 book &quot;Is Mars Habitable?&quot; by British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was a reply to, and refutation of, Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Mars and Its Canals&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s book concluded that Mars &quot;is not only uninhabited by intelligent beings such as Mr. Lowell postulates, but is absolutely uninhabitable.&quot; Historian Charles H. Smith refers to Wallace&#x27;s book as one of the first works in the field of astrobiology.

Spectroscopic analysis of Mars&#x27;s atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer William Wallace Campbell showed that neither water nor oxygen were present in the Martian atmosphere. The influential observer Eugène Antoniadi used the 83-cm (32.6 inch) aperture telescope at Meudon Observatory at the 1909 opposition of Mars and saw no canals, the outstanding photos of Mars taken at the new Baillaud dome at the Pic du Midi observatory also brought formal discredit to the Martian canals theory in 1909, and the notion of canals began to fall out of favor.

==Habitability==
Chemical, physical, geological, and geographic attributes shape the environments on Mars. Isolated measurements of these factors may be insufficient to deem an environment habitable, but the sum of measurements can help predict locations with greater or lesser habitability potential. The two current ecological approaches for predicting the potential habitability of the Martian surface use 19 or 20 environmental factors, with an emphasis on water availability, temperature, the presence of nutrients, an energy source, and protection from solar ultraviolet and galactic cosmic radiation.

Scientists do not know the minimum number of parameters for determination of habitability potential, but they are certain it is greater than one or two of the factors in the table below. Similarly, for each group of parameters, the habitability threshold for each is to be determined. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple lethal factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly. There are no full-Mars simulations published yet that include all of the biocidal factors combined. Furthermore, the possibility of Martian life having a far different biochemistry and habitability requirements than the terrestrial biosphere is an open question. A common hypothesis is methanogenic Martian life, and while such organisms exist on Earth too, they are exceptionally rare and cannot survive in the majority of terrestrial environments that contain oxygen. 

===Past===
Recent models have shown that, even with a dense CO2 atmosphere, early Mars was colder than Earth has ever been. Transiently warm conditions related to impacts or volcanism could have produced conditions favoring the formation of the late Noachian valley networks, even though the mid-late Noachian global conditions were probably icy. Local warming of the environment by volcanism and impacts would have been sporadic, but there should have been many events of water flowing at the surface of Mars. Both the mineralogical and the morphological evidence indicates a degradation of habitability from the mid Hesperian onward. The exact causes are not well understood but may be related to a combination of processes including loss of early atmosphere, or impact erosion, or both. Billions of years ago, before this degradation, the surface of Mars was apparently fairly habitable, consisted of liquid water and clement weather, though it is unknown if life existed on Mars.

The loss of the Martian magnetic field strongly affected surface environments through atmospheric loss and increased radiation; this change significantly degraded surface habitability. When there was a magnetic field, the atmosphere would have been protected from erosion by the solar wind, which would ensure the maintenance of a dense atmosphere, necessary for liquid water to exist on the surface of Mars. The loss of the atmosphere was accompanied by decreasing temperatures. Part of the liquid water inventory sublimed and was transported to the poles, while the rest became
trapped in permafrost, a subsurface ice layer.

Observations on Earth and numerical modeling have shown that a crater-forming impact can result in the creation of a long-lasting hydrothermal system when ice is present in the crust. For example, a 130 km large crater could sustain an active hydrothermal system for up to 2 million years, that is, long enough for microscopic life to emerge, but unlikely to have progressed any further down the evolutionary path.

Soil and rock samples studied in 2013 by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover&#x27;s onboard instruments brought about additional information on several habitability factors. The rover team identified some of the key chemical ingredients for life in this soil, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and possibly carbon, as well as clay minerals, suggesting a long-ago aqueous environment—perhaps a lake or an ancient streambed—that had neutral acidity and low salinity. On December 9, 2013, NASA reported that, based on evidence from &quot;Curiosity&quot; studying Aeolis Palus, Gale Crater contained an ancient freshwater lake which could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life. The confirmation that liquid water once flowed on Mars, the existence of nutrients, and the previous discovery of a past magnetic field that protected the planet from cosmic and solar radiation, together strongly suggest that Mars could have had the environmental factors to support life. The assessment of past habitability is not in itself evidence that Martian life has ever actually existed. If it did, it was probably microbial, existing communally in fluids or on sediments, either free-living or as biofilms, respectively. The exploration of terrestrial analogues provide clues as to how and where best look for signs of life on Mars.

Impactite, shown to preserve signs of life on Earth, was discovered on Mars and could contain signs of ancient life, if life ever existed on the planet.

On June 7, 2018, NASA announced that the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover had discovered organic molecules in sedimentary rocks dating to three billion years old. The detection of organic molecules in rocks indicate that some of the building blocks for life were present.

Research into how the conditions for habitability ended is ongoing. On October 7, 2024, NASA announced that the results of the previous three years of sampling onboard &quot;Curiosity&quot; suggested that based on high carbon-13 and oxygen-18 levels in the regolith, the early Martian atmosphere was less likely than previously thought, to be stable enough to support surface water hospitable to life, with rapid wetting-drying cycles and very high-salinity cryogenic brines providing potential explanations.

===Present===
Conceivably, if life exists (or existed) on Mars, evidence of life could be found, or is best preserved, in the subsurface, away from present-day harsh surface conditions. Present-day life on Mars, or its biosignatures, could occur kilometers below the surface, or in subsurface geothermal hot spots, or it could occur a few meters below the surface. The permafrost layer on Mars is only a couple of centimeters below the surface, and salty brines can be liquid a few centimeters below that but not far down. Water is close to its boiling point even at the deepest points in the Hellas basin, and so cannot remain liquid for long on the surface of Mars in its present state, except after a sudden release of underground water.

So far, NASA has pursued a &quot;follow the water&quot; strategy on Mars and has not searched for biosignatures for life there directly since the &quot;Viking&quot; missions. The consensus by astrobiologists is that it may be necessary to access the Martian subsurface to find currently habitable environments.

====Cosmic radiation====
In 1965, the Mariner 4 probe discovered that Mars had no global magnetic field that would protect the planet from potentially life-threatening cosmic radiation and solar radiation; observations made in the late 1990s by the Mars Global Surveyor confirmed this discovery. Scientists speculate that the lack of magnetic shielding helped the solar wind blow away much of Mars&#x27;s atmosphere over the course of several billion years. As a result, the planet has been vulnerable to radiation from space for about 4 billion years.

Recent &quot;in-situ&quot; data from &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover indicates that ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE) may not be a limiting factor in habitability assessments for present-day surface life on Mars. The level of 76 mGy per year measured by &quot;Curiosity&quot; is similar to levels inside the ISS. 

====Cumulative effects====
&quot;Curiosity&quot; rover measured ionizing radiation levels of 76 mGy per year. This level of ionizing radiation is sterilizing for dormant life on the surface of Mars. It varies considerably in habitability depending on its orbital eccentricity and the tilt of its axis. If the surface life has been reanimated as recently as 450,000 years ago, then rovers on Mars could find dormant but still viable life at a depth of one meter below the surface, according to an estimate. Even the hardiest cells known could not possibly survive the cosmic radiation near the surface of Mars since Mars lost its protective magnetosphere and atmosphere. After mapping cosmic radiation levels at various depths on Mars, researchers have concluded that over time, any life within the first several meters of the planet&#x27;s surface would be killed by lethal doses of cosmic radiation. The team calculated that the cumulative damage to DNA and RNA by cosmic radiation would limit retrieving viable dormant cells on Mars to depths greater than 7.5 meters below the planet&#x27;s surface.
Even the most radiation-tolerant terrestrial bacteria would survive in dormant spore state only 18,000 years at the surface; at 2 meters—the greatest depth at which the ExoMars rover will be capable of reaching—survival time would be 90,000 to half a million years, depending on the type of rock.

Data collected by the Radiation assessment detector (RAD) instrument on board the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover revealed that the absorbed dose measured is 76 mGy/year at the surface, and that &quot;ionizing radiation strongly influences chemical compositions and structures, especially for water, salts, and redox-sensitive components such as organic molecules.&quot; Regardless of the source of Martian organic compounds (meteoric, geological, or biological), its carbon bonds are susceptible to breaking and reconfiguring with surrounding elements by ionizing charged particle radiation. These improved subsurface radiation estimates give insight into the potential for the preservation of possible organic biosignatures as a function of depth as well as survival times of possible microbial or bacterial life forms left dormant beneath the surface. The report concludes that the &quot;in situ&quot; &quot;surface measurements—and subsurface estimates—constrain the preservation window for Martian organic matter following exhumation and exposure to ionizing radiation in the top few meters of the Martian surface.&quot;

In September 2017, NASA reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet Mars were temporarily doubled and were associated with an aurora 25 times brighter than any observed earlier, due to a major, and unexpected, solar storm in the middle of the month.

====UV radiation====
On UV radiation, a 2014 report concludes that &quot;[T]he Martian UV radiation environment is rapidly lethal to unshielded microbes but can be attenuated by global dust storms and shielded completely by &lt; 1 mm of regolith or by other organisms.&quot; In addition, laboratory research published in July 2017 demonstrated that UV irradiated perchlorates cause a 10.8-fold increase in cell death when compared to cells exposed to UV radiation after 60 seconds of exposure. The penetration depth of UV radiation into soils is in the sub-millimeter to millimeter range and depends on the properties of the soil. A recent study found that photosynthesis could occur within dusty ice exposed in the Martian mid-latitudes because the overlying dusty ice blocks the harmful ultraviolet radiation at Mars’ surface. 

====Perchlorates====
The Martian regolith is known to contain a maximum of 0.5% (w/v) perchlorate (ClO4−) that is toxic for most living organisms, but since they drastically lower the freezing point of water and a few extremophiles can use it as an energy source (see Perchlorates - Biology) and grow at concentrations of up to 30% (w/v) sodium perchlorate by physiologically adapting to increasing perchlorate concentrations, it has prompted speculation of what their influence would be on habitability.

Research published in July 2017 shows that when irradiated with a simulated Martian UV flux, perchlorates become even more lethal to bacteria (bactericide). Even dormant spores lost viability within minutes. In addition, two other compounds of the Martian surface, iron oxides and hydrogen peroxide, act in synergy with irradiated perchlorates to cause a 10.8-fold increase in cell death when compared to cells exposed to UV radiation after 60 seconds of exposure. It was also found that abraded silicates (quartz and basalt) lead to the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species. The researchers concluded that &quot;the surface of Mars is lethal to vegetative cells and renders much of the surface and near-surface regions uninhabitable.&quot; This research demonstrates that the present-day surface is more uninhabitable than previously thought, and reinforces the notion to inspect at least a few meters into the ground to ensure the levels of radiation would be relatively low.

However, researcher Kennda Lynch discovered the first-known instance of a habitat containing perchlorates and perchlorates-reducing bacteria in an analog environment: a paleolake in Pilot Valley, Great Salt Lake Desert, Utah, United States. She has been studying the biosignatures of these microbes, and is hoping that the Mars Perseverance rover will find matching biosignatures at its Jezero Crater site.

====Recurrent slope lineae====
Recurrent slope lineae (RSL) features form on Sun-facing slopes at times of the year when the local temperatures reach above the melting point for ice. The streaks grow in spring, widen in late summer and then fade away in autumn. This is hard to model in any other way except as involving liquid water in some form, though the streaks themselves are thought to be a secondary effect and not a direct indication of the dampness of the regolith. Although these features are now confirmed to involve liquid water in some form, the water could be either too cold or too salty for life. At present they are treated as potentially habitable, as &quot;Uncertain Regions, to be treated as Special Regions&quot;.). They were suspected as involving flowing brines back then.

The thermodynamic availability of water (water activity) strictly limits microbial propagation on Earth, particularly in hypersaline environments, and there are indications that the brine ionic strength is a barrier to the habitability of Mars. Experiments show that high ionic strength, driven to extremes on Mars by the ubiquitous occurrence of divalent ions, &quot;renders these environments uninhabitable despite the presence of biologically available water.&quot;

===Nitrogen fixation===
After carbon, nitrogen is arguably the most important element needed for life. Thus, measurements of nitrate over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required to address the question of its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N2) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support nitrogen fixation for biological incorporation. Nitrogen in the form of nitrate could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes. On Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed by thermal shock from impact or volcanic plume lightning on ancient Mars.

On March 24, 2015, NASA reported that the SAM instrument on the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover detected nitrates by heating surface sediments. The nitrogen in nitrate is in a &quot;fixed&quot; state, meaning that it is in an oxidized form that can be used by living organisms. The discovery supports the notion that ancient Mars may have been hospitable for life. It is suspected that all nitrate on Mars is a relic, with no modern contribution. Nitrate abundance ranges from non-detection to 681 ± 304 mg/kg in the samples examined until late 2017. Modeling indicates that the transient condensed water films on the surface should be transported to lower depths (≈10 m) potentially transporting nitrates, where subsurface microorganisms could thrive.

In contrast, phosphate, one of the chemical nutrients thought to be essential for life, is readily available on Mars.

===Low pressure===
Further complicating estimates of the habitability of the Martian surface is the fact that very little is known about the growth of microorganisms at pressures close to those on the surface of Mars. Some teams determined that some bacteria may be capable of cellular replication down to 25 mbar, but that is still above the atmospheric pressures found on Mars (range 1–14 mbar). In another study, twenty-six strains of bacteria were chosen based on their recovery from spacecraft assembly facilities, and only &quot;Serratia liquefaciens&quot; strain ATCC 27592 exhibited growth at 7 mbar, 0 °C, and CO2-enriched anoxic atmospheres.

==Liquid water==
Liquid water is a necessary but not sufficient condition for life as humans know it, as habitability is a function of a multitude of environmental parameters. Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars except at the lowest elevations for minutes or hours. Liquid water does not appear at the surface itself, but it could form in minuscule amounts around dust particles in snow heated by the Sun. Also, the ancient equatorial ice sheets beneath the ground may slowly sublimate or melt, accessible from the surface via caves.

Water on Mars exists almost exclusively as water ice, located in the Martian polar ice caps and under the shallow Martian surface even at more temperate latitudes. A small amount of water vapor is present in the atmosphere. There are no bodies of liquid water on the Martian surface because the water vapor pressure is less than 1 Pa, the atmospheric pressure at the surface averages —about 0.6% of Earth&#x27;s mean sea level pressure—and because the temperature is far too low, () leading to immediate freezing. Despite this, about 3.8 billion years ago, there was a denser atmosphere, higher temperature, and vast amounts of liquid water flowed on the surface, including large oceans. 
It has been estimated that the primordial oceans on Mars would have covered between 36% and 75% of the planet. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior.

Analysis of Martian sandstones, using data obtained from orbital spectrometry, suggests that the waters that previously existed on the surface of Mars would have had too high a salinity to support most Earth-like life. Tosca &quot;et al.&quot; found that the Martian water in the locations they studied all had water activity, aw ≤ 0.78 to 0.86—a level fatal to most Terrestrial life. Haloarchaea, however, are able to live in hypersaline solutions, up to the saturation point.

In June 2000, possible evidence for current liquid water flowing at the surface of Mars was discovered in the form of flood-like gullies. Additional similar images were published in 2006, taken by the Mars Global Surveyor, that suggested that water occasionally flows on the surface of Mars. The images showed changes in steep crater walls and sediment deposits, providing the strongest evidence yet that water coursed through them as recently as several years ago.

There is disagreement in the scientific community as to whether or not the recent gully streaks were formed by liquid water. Some suggest the flows were merely dry sand flows. Others suggest it may be liquid brine near the surface, but the exact source of the water and the mechanism behind its motion are not understood.

In July 2018, scientists reported the discovery of a subglacial lake on Mars, below the southern polar ice cap, and extending sideways about , the first known stable body of water on the planet. The lake was discovered using the MARSIS radar on board the &quot;Mars Express&quot; orbiter, and the profiles were collected between May 2012 and December 2015. The lake is centered at 193°E, 81°S, a flat area that does not exhibit any peculiar topographic characteristics but is surrounded by higher ground, except on its eastern side, where there is a depression. However, subsequent studies disagree on whether any liquid can be present at this depth without anomalous heating from the interior of the planet. Instead, some studies propose that other factors may have led to radar signals resembling those containing liquid water, such as clays, or interference between layers of ice and dust. 

===Silica===
In May 2007, the &quot;Spirit&quot; rover disturbed a patch of ground with its inoperative wheel, uncovering an area 90% rich in silica. The feature is reminiscent of the effect of hot spring water or steam coming into contact with volcanic rocks. Scientists consider this as evidence of a past environment that may have been favorable for microbial life and theorize that one possible origin for the silica may have been produced by the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water.

Based on Earth analogs, hydrothermal systems on Mars would be highly attractive for their potential for preserving organic and inorganic biosignatures. For this reason, hydrothermal deposits are regarded as important targets in the exploration for fossil evidence of ancient Martian life.

==Possible biosignatures==
In May 2017, evidence of the earliest known life on land on Earth may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. These findings may be helpful in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.

===Methane===
Methane (CH4) is chemically unstable in the current oxidizing atmosphere of Mars. It would quickly break down due to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and chemical reactions with other gases. Therefore, a persistent presence of methane in the atmosphere may imply the existence of a source to continually replenish the gas.

Trace amounts of methane, at the level of several parts per billion (ppb), were first reported in Mars&#x27;s atmosphere by a team at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 2003. Large differences in the abundances were measured between observations taken in 2003 and 2006, which suggested that the methane was locally concentrated and probably seasonal. On June 7, 2018, NASA announced it has detected a seasonal variation of methane levels on Mars.

The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), launched in March 2016, began on April 21, 2018, to map the concentration and sources of methane in the atmosphere, as well as its decomposition products such as formaldehyde and methanol. As of May 2019, the Trace Gas Orbiter showed that the concentration of methane is under detectable level (&lt; 0.05 ppbv).

The principal candidates for the origin of Mars&#x27;s methane include non-biological processes such as water-rock reactions, radiolysis of water, and pyrite formation, all of which produce H2 that could then generate methane and other hydrocarbons via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis with CO and CO2. It has also been shown that methane could be produced by a process involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars. Although geologic sources of methane such as serpentinization are possible, the lack of current volcanism, hydrothermal activity or hotspots are not favorable for geologic methane.

Living microorganisms, such as methanogens, are another possible source, but no evidence for the presence of such organisms has been found on Mars, until June 2019 as methane was detected by the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover. Methanogens do not require oxygen or organic nutrients, are non-photosynthetic, use hydrogen as their energy source and carbon dioxide (CO2) as their carbon source, so they could exist in subsurface environments on Mars. If microscopic Martian life is producing the methane, it probably resides far below the surface, where it is still warm enough for liquid water to exist.

Since the 2003 discovery of methane in the atmosphere, some scientists have been designing models and &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments testing the growth of methanogenic bacteria on simulated Martian soil, where all four methanogen strains tested produced substantial levels of methane, even in the presence of 1.0wt% perchlorate salt.

A team led by Levin suggested that both phenomena—methane production and degradation—could be accounted for by an ecology of methane-producing and methane-consuming microorganisms.

Research at the University of Arkansas presented in June 2015 suggested that some methanogens could survive in Mars&#x27;s low pressure. Rebecca Mickol found that in her laboratory, four species of methanogens survived low-pressure conditions that were similar to a subsurface liquid aquifer on Mars. The four species that she tested were &quot;Methanothermobacter wolfeii&quot;, &quot;Methanosarcina barkeri&quot;, &quot;Methanobacterium formicicum&quot;, and &quot;Methanococcus maripaludis&quot;. In June 2012, scientists reported that measuring the ratio of hydrogen and methane levels on Mars may help determine the likelihood of life on Mars. According to the scientists, &quot;low H2/CH4 ratios (less than approximately 40)&quot; would &quot;indicate that life is likely present and active&quot;. The observed ratios in the lower Martian atmosphere were &quot;approximately 10 times&quot; higher &quot;suggesting that biological processes may not be responsible for the observed CH4&quot;. The scientists suggested measuring the H2 and CH4 flux at the Martian surface for a more accurate assessment. Other scientists have recently reported methods of detecting hydrogen and methane in extraterrestrial atmospheres.

Even if rover missions determine that microscopic Martian life is the seasonal source of the methane, the life forms probably reside far below the surface, outside of the rover&#x27;s reach.

===Formaldehyde===
In February 2005, it was announced that the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) on the European Space Agency&#x27;s Mars Express Orbiter had detected traces of formaldehyde in the atmosphere of Mars. Vittorio Formisano, the director of the PFS, has speculated that the formaldehyde could be the byproduct of the oxidation of methane and, according to him, would provide evidence that Mars is either extremely geologically active or harboring colonies of microbial life. NASA scientists consider the preliminary findings well worth a follow-up but have also rejected the claims of life.

===Viking lander biological experiments===
The 1970s Viking program placed two identical landers on the surface of Mars tasked to look for biosignatures of microbial life on the surface. The &#x27;Labeled Release&#x27; (LR) experiment gave a positive result for metabolism, while the gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer did not detect organic compounds. The LR was a specific experiment designed to test only a narrowly defined critical aspect of the theory concerning the possibility of life on Mars; therefore, the overall results were declared inconclusive. No Mars lander mission has found meaningful traces of biomolecules or biosignatures. The claim of extant microbial life on Mars is based on old data collected by the Viking landers, currently reinterpreted as sufficient evidence of life, mainly by Gilbert Levin, Joseph D. Miller, Navarro, Giorgio Bianciardi and Patricia Ann Straat.

Assessments published in December 2010 by Rafael Navarro-Gonzáles indicate that organic compounds &quot;could have been present&quot; in the soil analyzed by both Viking 1 and 2. The study determined that perchlorate—discovered in 2008 by Phoenix lander—can destroy organic compounds when heated, and produce chloromethane and dichloromethane as a byproduct, the identical chlorine compounds discovered by both Viking landers when they performed the same tests on Mars. Because perchlorate would have broken down any Martian organics, the question of whether or not Viking found organic compounds is still wide open.

The Labeled Release evidence was not generally accepted initially, and, to this day lacks the consensus of the scientific community.

===Meteorites===
As of 2018, there are 224 known Martian meteorites (some of which were found in several fragments). These are valuable because they are the only physical samples of Mars available to Earth-bound laboratories. Some researchers have argued that microscopic features found in ALH84001 are , however this interpretation has been highly controversial and is not supported by the majority of researchers in the field.

Seven criteria have been established for the recognition of past life within terrestrial geologic samples. Those criteria are:
# Is the geologic context of the sample compatible with past life?
# Is the age of the sample and its stratigraphic location compatible with possible life?
# Does the sample contain evidence of cellular morphology and colonies?
# Is there any evidence of biominerals showing chemical or mineral disequilibria?
# Is there any evidence of stable isotope patterns unique to biology?
# Are there any organic biomarkers present?
# Are the features indigenous to the sample?

For general acceptance of past life in a geologic sample, essentially most or all of these criteria must be met. All seven criteria have not yet been met for any of the Martian samples.

====ALH84001====
In 1996, the Martian meteorite ALH84001, a specimen that is much older than the majority of Martian meteorites that have been recovered so far, received considerable attention when a group of NASA scientists led by David S. McKay reported microscopic features and geochemical anomalies that they considered to be best explained by the rock having hosted Martian bacteria in the distant past. Some of these features resembled terrestrial bacteria, aside from their being much smaller than any known form of life. Much controversy arose over this claim, and ultimately all of the evidence McKay&#x27;s team cited as evidence of life was found to be explainable by non-biological processes. Although the scientific community has largely rejected the claim ALH 84001 contains evidence of ancient Martian life, the controversy associated with it is now seen as a historically significant moment in the development of exobiology.


====Nakhla====
The Nakhla meteorite fell on Earth on June 28, 1911, on the locality of Nakhla, Alexandria, Egypt.

In 1998, a team from NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center obtained a small sample for analysis. Researchers found preterrestrial aqueous alteration phases and objects of the size and shape consistent with Earthly fossilized nanobacteria.
Analysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) studied its high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 2000, and NASA scientists concluded that as much as 75% of the organic compounds in Nakhla &quot;may not be recent terrestrial contamination&quot;.

This caused additional interest in this meteorite, so in 2006, NASA managed to obtain an additional and larger sample from the London Natural History Museum. On this second sample, a large dendritic carbon content was observed. When the results and evidence were published in 2006, some independent researchers claimed that the carbon deposits are of biologic origin. It was remarked that since carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the Universe, finding it in curious patterns is not indicative or suggestive of biological origin.

====Shergotty====
The Shergotty meteorite, a Martian meteorite, fell on Earth on Shergotty, India on August 25, 1865, and was retrieved by witnesses almost immediately. It is composed mostly of pyroxene and thought to have undergone preterrestrial aqueous alteration for several centuries. Certain features in its interior suggest remnants of a biofilm and its associated microbial communities.

====Yamato 000593====
Yamato 000593 is the second largest meteorite from Mars found on Earth. Studies suggest the Martian meteorite was formed about 1.3 billion years ago from a lava flow on Mars. An impact occurred on Mars about 12 million years ago and ejected the meteorite from the Martian surface into space. The meteorite landed on Earth in Antarctica about 50,000 years ago. The mass of the meteorite is and it has been found to contain evidence of past water movement. At a microscopic level, spheres are found in the meteorite that are rich in carbon compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres. The carbon-rich spheres may have been formed by biotic activity according to NASA scientists.

===Ichnofossil-like structures===
Organism–substrate interactions and their products are important biosignatures on Earth as they represent direct evidence of biological behaviour. It was the recovery of fossilized products of life-substrate interactions (ichnofossils) that has revealed biological activities in the early history of life on the Earth, e.g., Proterozoic burrows, Archean microborings and stromatolites. Two major ichnofossil-like structures have been reported from Mars, i.e. the stick-like structures from Vera Rubin Ridge and the microtunnels from Martian Meteorites.

Observations at Vera Rubin Ridge by the Mars Space Laboratory rover &quot;Curiosity&quot; show millimetric, elongate structures preserved in sedimentary rocks deposited in fluvio-lacustrine environments within Gale Crater. Morphometric and topologic data are unique to the stick-like structures among Martian geological features and show that ichnofossils are among the closest morphological analogues of these unique features. Nevertheless, available data cannot fully disprove two major abiotic hypotheses, that are sedimentary cracking and evaporitic crystal growth as genetic processes for the structures.

Microtunnels have been described from Martian meteorites. They consist of straight to curved microtunnels that may contain areas of enhanced carbon abundance. The morphology of the curved microtunnels is consistent with biogenic traces on Earth, including microbioerosion traces observed in basaltic glasses. Further studies are needed to confirm biogenicity.

==Geysers==

The seasonal frosting and defrosting of the southern ice cap results in the formation of spider-like radial channels carved on 1-meter thick ice by sunlight. Then, sublimed CO2 – and probably water – increase pressure in their interior producing geyser-like eruptions of cold fluids often mixed with dark basaltic sand or mud. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars.

A team of Hungarian scientists propose that the geysers&#x27; most visible features, dark dune spots and spider channels, may be colonies of photosynthetic Martian microorganisms, which over-winter beneath the ice cap, and as the sunlight returns to the pole during early spring, light penetrates the ice, the microorganisms photosynthesize and heat their immediate surroundings. A pocket of liquid water, which would normally evaporate instantly in the thin Martian atmosphere, is trapped around them by the overlying ice. As this ice layer thins, the microorganisms show through grey. When the layer has completely melted, the microorganisms rapidly desiccate and turn black, surrounded by a grey aureole. The Hungarian scientists believe that even a complex sublimation process is insufficient to explain the formation and evolution of the dark dune spots in space and time. Since their discovery, fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke promoted these formations as deserving of study from an astrobiological perspective.

A multinational European team suggests that if liquid water is present in the spiders&#x27; channels during their annual defrost cycle, they might provide a niche where certain microscopic life forms could have retreated and adapted while sheltered from solar radiation. A British team also considers the possibility that organic matter, microbes, or even simple plants might co-exist with these inorganic formations, especially if the mechanism includes liquid water and a geothermal energy source. They also remark that the majority of geological structures may be accounted for without invoking any organic &quot;life on Mars&quot; hypothesis. It has been proposed to develop the Mars Geyser Hopper lander to study the geysers up close.

==Forward contamination==
Planetary protection of Mars aims to prevent biological contamination of the planet. A major goal is to preserve the planetary record of natural processes by preventing human-caused microbial introductions, also called forward contamination. There is abundant evidence as to what can happen when organisms from regions on Earth that have been isolated from one another for significant periods of time are introduced into each other&#x27;s environment. Species that are constrained in one environment can thrive – often out of control – in another environment much to the detriment of the original species that were present. In some ways, this problem could be compounded if life forms from one planet were introduced into the totally alien ecology of another world.

The prime concern of hardware contaminating Mars derives from incomplete spacecraft sterilization of some hardy terrestrial bacteria (extremophiles) despite best efforts. Hardware includes landers, crashed probes, end-of-mission disposal of hardware, and the hard landing of entry, descent, and landing systems. This has prompted research on survival rates of radiation-resistant microorganisms including the species &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; and genera &quot;Brevundimonas&quot;, &quot;Rhodococcus&quot;, and &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; under simulated Martian conditions. Results from one of these experimental irradiation experiments, combined with previous radiation modeling, indicate that &quot;Brevundimonas&quot; sp. MV.7 emplaced only 30 cm deep in Martian dust could survive the cosmic radiation for up to 100,000 years before suffering 106 population reduction. The diurnal Mars-like cycles in temperature and relative humidity affected the viability of &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; cells quite severely. In other simulations, &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; also failed to grow under low atmospheric pressure, under 0 °C, or in the absence of oxygen.

==Survival under simulated Martian conditions==
Since the 1950s, researchers have used containers that simulate environmental conditions on Mars to determine the viability of a variety of lifeforms on Mars. Such devices, called &quot;Mars jars&quot; or &quot;Mars simulation chambers&quot;, were first described and used in U.S. Air Force research in the 1950s by Hubertus Strughold, and popularized in civilian research by Joshua Lederberg and Carl Sagan.

On April 26, 2012, scientists reported that an extremophile lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under Martian conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The ability to survive in an environment is not the same as the ability to thrive, reproduce, and evolve in that same environment, necessitating further study.

Although numerous studies point to resistance to some of Mars conditions, they do so separately, and none has considered the full range of Martian surface conditions, including temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, radiation, humidity, oxidizing regolith including perchlorates, and others, all at the same time and in combination. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple lethal factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly.

===Water salinity and temperature===
Astrobiologists funded by NASA are researching the limits of microbial life in solutions with high salt concentrations at low temperature. Any body of liquid water under the polar ice caps or underground is likely to exist under high hydrostatic pressure and have a significant salt concentration. They know that the landing site of &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander was found to be regolith cemented with water ice and salts, and the soil samples likely contained magnesium sulfate, magnesium perchlorate, sodium perchlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chloride and calcium carbonate. Earth bacteria capable of growth and reproduction in the presence of highly salted solutions, called halophile or &quot;salt-lover&quot;, were tested for survival using salts commonly found on Mars and at decreasing temperatures. The species tested include &quot;Halomonas&quot;, &quot;Marinococcus&quot;, &quot;Nesterenkonia&quot;, and &quot;Virgibacillus&quot;. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple Martian environmental factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly, however, halophile bacteria were grown in a lab in water solutions containing more than 25% of salts common on Mars, and starting in 2019, the experiments will incorporate exposure to low temperature, salts, and high pressure.

===Mars-like regions on Earth===
On 21 February 2023, scientists reported the findings of a &quot;dark microbiome&quot; of unfamiliar microorganisms in the Atacama Desert in Chile, a Mars-like region of Earth.

==Missions==

===Mars-2===
Mars-1 was the first spacecraft launched to Mars in 1962, but communication was lost while en route to Mars. With Mars-2 and Mars-3 in 1971–1972, information was obtained on the nature of the surface rocks and altitude profiles of the surface density of the soil, its thermal conductivity, and thermal anomalies detected on the surface of Mars. The program found that its northern polar cap has a temperature below and that the water vapor content in the atmosphere of Mars is five thousand times less than on Earth. No signs of life were found.

Signs of life of the Mars space program AMS from orbit were not found. The descent vehicle Mars-2 crashed on landing, the descent vehicle Mars-3 launched 1.5 minutes after landing in the Ptolemaeus crater, but worked only 14.5 seconds/

===Mariner 4===

Mariner 4 probe performed the first successful flyby of the planet Mars, returning the first pictures of the Martian surface in 1965. The photographs showed an arid Mars without rivers, oceans, or any signs of life. Further, it revealed that the surface (at least the parts that it photographed) was covered in craters, indicating a lack of plate tectonics and weathering of any kind for the last 4 billion years. The probe also found that Mars has no global magnetic field that would protect the planet from potentially life-threatening cosmic rays. The probe was able to calculate the atmospheric pressure on the planet to be about 0.6 kPa (compared to Earth&#x27;s 101.3 kPa), meaning that liquid water could not exist on the planet&#x27;s surface. After Mariner 4, the search for life on Mars changed to a search for bacteria-like living organisms rather than for multicellular organisms, as the environment was clearly too harsh for these.

===&quot;Viking&quot; orbiters===
Liquid water is necessary for known life and metabolism, so if water was present on Mars, the chances of it having supported life may have been determinant. The &quot;Viking&quot; orbiters found evidence of possible river valleys in many areas, erosion and, in the southern hemisphere, branched streams.

===Viking biological experiments===
The primary mission of the Viking probes of the mid-1970s was to carry out experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil because the favorable conditions for the evolution of multicellular organisms ceased some four billion years ago on Mars. The tests were formulated to look for microbial life similar to that found on Earth. Of the four experiments, only the Labeled Release (LR) experiment returned a positive result, showing increased 14CO2 production on first exposure of soil to water and nutrients. All scientists agree on two points from the Viking missions: that radiolabeled 14CO2 was evolved in the Labeled Release experiment, and that the GCMS detected no organic molecules. There are vastly different interpretations of what those results imply: A 2011 astrobiology textbook notes that the GCMS was the decisive factor due to which &quot;For most of the Viking scientists, the final conclusion was that the &quot;Viking&quot; missions failed to detect life in the Martian soil.&quot;

Norman Horowitz was the head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory bioscience section for the Mariner and Viking missions from 1965 to 1976. Horowitz considered that the great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide solutions, even exotic solutions, to the problems of survival of life on other planets. However, he also considered that the conditions found on Mars were incompatible with carbon based life.

One of the designers of the Labeled Release experiment, Gilbert Levin, believes his results are a definitive diagnostic for life on Mars. Levin&#x27;s interpretation is disputed by many scientists. A 2006 astrobiology textbook noted that &quot;With unsterilized Terrestrial samples, though, the addition of more nutrients after the initial incubation would then produce still more radioactive gas as the dormant bacteria sprang into action to consume the new dose of food. This was not true of the Martian soil; on Mars, the second and third nutrient injections did not produce any further release of labeled gas.&quot; Other scientists argue that superoxides in the soil could have produced this effect without life being present. An almost general consensus discarded the Labeled Release data as evidence of life, because the gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer, designed to identify natural organic matter, did not detect organic molecules. More recently, high levels of organic chemicals, particularly chlorobenzene, were detected in powder drilled from one of the rocks, named &quot;Cumberland&quot;, analyzed by the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover. The results of the Viking mission concerning life are considered by the general expert community as inconclusive.

In 2007, during a Seminar of the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution (Washington, D.C., US), Gilbert Levin&#x27;s investigation was assessed once more. Levin still maintains that his original data were correct, as the positive and negative control experiments were in order. Moreover, Levin&#x27;s team, on April 12, 2012, reported a statistical speculation, based on old data—reinterpreted mathematically through cluster analysis—of the Labeled Release experiments, that may suggest evidence of &quot;extant microbial life on Mars&quot;. Critics counter that the method has not yet been proven effective for differentiating between biological and non-biological processes on Earth so it is premature to draw any conclusions.

A research team from the National Autonomous University of Mexico headed by Rafael Navarro-González concluded that the GCMS equipment (TV-GC-MS) used by the Viking program to search for organic molecules, may not be sensitive enough to detect low levels of organics. Klaus Biemann, the principal investigator of the GCMS experiment on &quot;Viking&quot; wrote a rebuttal. Because of the simplicity of sample handling, TV–GC–MS is still considered the standard method for organic detection on future Mars missions, so Navarro-González suggests that the design of future organic instruments for Mars should include other methods of detection.

After the discovery of perchlorates on Mars by the Phoenix lander, practically the same team of Navarro-González published a paper arguing that the Viking GCMS results were compromised by the presence of perchlorates. A 2011 astrobiology textbook notes that &quot;while perchlorate is too poor an oxidizer to reproduce the LR results (under the conditions of that experiment perchlorate does not oxidize organics), it does oxidize, and thus destroy, organics at the higher temperatures used in the Viking GCMS experiment.&quot; Biemann has written a commentary critical of this Navarro-González paper as well, to which the latter have replied; the exchange was published in December 2011.

===&quot;Phoenix&quot; lander, 2008===
The &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission landed a robotic spacecraft in the polar region of Mars on May 25, 2008, and it operated until November 10, 2008. One of the mission&#x27;s two primary objectives was to search for a &quot;habitable zone&quot; in the Martian regolith where microbial life could exist, the other main goal being to study the geological history of water on Mars. The lander has a 2.5 meter robotic arm that was capable of digging shallow trenches in the regolith. There was an electrochemistry experiment which analysed the ions in the regolith and the amount and type of antioxidants on Mars. The Viking program data indicate that oxidants on Mars may vary with latitude, noting that &quot;Viking 2&quot; saw fewer oxidants than &quot;Viking 1&quot; in its more northerly position. &quot;Phoenix&quot; landed further north still.
&quot;Phoenix&quot;″s preliminary data revealed that Mars soil contains perchlorate, and thus may not be as life-friendly as thought earlier. The pH and salinity level were viewed as benign from the standpoint of biology. The analysers also indicated the presence of bound water and CO2. A recent analysis of Martian meteorite EETA79001 found 0.6 ppm ClO4−, 1.4 ppm ClO3−, and 16 ppm NO3−, most likely of Martian origin. The ClO3− suggests presence of other highly oxidizing oxychlorines such as ClO2− or ClO, produced both by UV oxidation of Cl and X-ray radiolysis of ClO4−. Thus only highly refractory and/or well-protected (sub-surface) organics are likely to survive. In addition, recent analysis of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; WCL showed that the Ca(ClO4)2 in the &quot;Phoenix&quot; soil has not interacted with liquid water of any form, perhaps for as long as 600 Myr. If it had, the highly soluble Ca(ClO4)2 in contact with liquid water would have formed only CaSO4. This suggests a severely arid environment, with minimal or no liquid water interaction.

===Mars Science Laboratory (&quot;Curiosity&quot; rover)===


The Mars Science Laboratory mission is a NASA project that launched on November 26, 2011, the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover, a nuclear-powered robotic vehicle, bearing instruments designed to assess past and present habitability conditions on Mars. The &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover landed on Mars on Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater, near Aeolis Mons (a.k.a. Mount Sharp), on August 6, 2012.

On December 16, 2014, NASA reported the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover detected a &quot;tenfold spike&quot;, likely localized, in the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere. Sample measurements taken &quot;a dozen times over 20 months&quot; showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014, averaging &quot;7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere&quot;. Before and after that, readings averaged around one-tenth that level. In addition, low levels of chlorobenzene (), were detected in powder drilled from one of the rocks, named &quot;Cumberland&quot;, analyzed by the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover.

===Mars 2020 (&quot;Perseverance&quot; rover)===
The NASA &quot;Mars 2020&quot; mission includes the &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover. Launched on July 30, 2020 it is intended to investigate an astrobiologically relevant ancient environment on Mars. This includes its surface geological processes and history, and an assessment of its past habitability and the potential for preservation of biosignatures within accessible geological materials. &quot;Perseverance&quot; has been on Mars for .

The Cheyava Falls rock discovered on Mars in June 2024 has been designated by NASA as a &quot;potential biosignature&quot; and was core sampled by the Perseverance rover for possible return to Earth and further examination. Although highly intriguing, no definitive final determination on a biological or abiotic origin of this rock can be made with the data currently available.

===Future astrobiology missions===
* ExoMars is a European-led multi-spacecraft programme currently under development by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Roscosmos for launch in 2016 and 2020. Its primary scientific mission will be to search for possible biosignatures on Mars, past or present. A rover with a core drill will be used to sample various depths beneath the surface where liquid water may be found and where microorganisms or organic biosignatures might survive cosmic radiation. The program was suspended in 2022, and is unlikely to launch before 2028.
* Mars sample-return mission – The best life detection experiment proposed is the examination on Earth of a soil sample from Mars. However, the difficulty of providing and maintaining life support over the months of transit from Mars to Earth remains to be solved. Providing for still unknown environmental and nutritional requirements is daunting, so it was concluded that &quot;investigating carbon-based organic compounds would be one of the more fruitful approaches for seeking potential signs of life in returned samples as opposed to culture-based approaches.&quot;

==Human colonization of Mars==
Some of the main reasons for colonizing Mars include economic interests, long-term scientific research best carried out by humans as opposed to robotic probes, and sheer curiosity. Surface conditions and the presence of water on Mars make it arguably the most hospitable of the planets in the Solar System, other than Earth. Human colonization of Mars would require &quot;in situ&quot; resource utilization (ISRU); A NASA report states that &quot;applicable frontier technologies include robotics, machine intelligence, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, 3-D printing/additive manufacturing, and autonomy. These technologies combined with the vast natural resources should enable, pre- and post-human arrival ISRU to greatly increase reliability and safety and reduce cost for human colonization of Mars.&quot;

<text>Eurisko (Gr., &quot;I discover&quot;) is a discovery system written by Douglas Lenat in RLL-1, a representation language itself written in the Lisp programming language. A sequel to Automated Mathematician, it consists of heuristics, i.e. rules of thumb, including heuristics describing how to use and change its own heuristics. Lenat was frustrated by Automated Mathematician&#x27;s constraint to a single domain and so developed Eurisko; his frustration with the effort of encoding domain knowledge for Eurisko led to Lenat&#x27;s subsequent development of Cyc. Lenat envisioned ultimately coupling the Cyc knowledgebase with the Eurisko discovery engine.

== History ==
Development commenced at Carnegie Mellon in 1976 and continued at Stanford University in 1978 when Lenat returned to teach. &quot;For the first five years, nothing good came out of it&quot;, Lenat said. But when the implementation was changed to a frame language based representation he called RLL (Representation Language Language), heuristic creation and modification became much simpler. Eurisko was then applied to a number of domains with surprising success, including VLSI chip design.

Lenat and Eurisko gained notoriety by submitting the winning fleet (a large number of stationary, lightly-armored ships with many small weapons) to the United States Traveller TCS national championship in 1981, forcing extensive changes to the game&#x27;s rules. The fleet had 96 ships, 75 of which were of the &quot;Eurisko class&quot;. The detailed composition was published.

However, Eurisko won again in 1982 when the program discovered that the rules permitted the program to destroy its own ships, permitting it to continue to use much the same strategy. Tournament officials announced that if Eurisko won another championship the competition would be abolished; Lenat retired Eurisko from the game. The Traveller TCS wins brought Lenat to the attention of DARPA, which has funded much of his subsequent work.

Lenat was known for keeping his source code confidential during his lifetime. In 2023, it was reported that source code for both Eurisko and the previous Automated Mathematician system had been found in public code archives. The following year, Eurisko code was shown running under Medley Interlisp.

==In popular culture==
In the first-season &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;, Eurisko is the name of a fictional software company responsible for the episode&#x27;s &quot;monster of the week&quot;, facilities management software known as &quot;Central Operating System&quot;, or &quot;COS&quot;. COS (described in the episode as an &quot;adaptive network&quot;) is shown to be capable of learning when its designer arrives at Eurisko headquarters and is surprised to find that COS has given itself the ability to speak. The designer is forced to create a virus to destroy COS after COS commits a series of murders in an apparent effort to prevent its own destruction.

Lenat is mentioned and Eurisko is discussed at the end of Richard Feynman&#x27;s Computer Heuristics Lecture as part of the Idiosyncratic Thinking Workshop Series.

Lenat and Eurisko are mentioned in the 2019 James Rollins novel &quot;Crucible&quot; that deals with artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence.

<text>Doghouse Records is an American record label currently based in New York City. The company was founded by Dirk Hemsath in late 1987 while living in Toledo, Ohio, in order to release the recordings of his hardcore band, Majority of One. The label originally specialized in midwest emo and melodic hardcore, though it eventually incorporated punk rock, pop punk, indie rock and alternative rock artists.

Doghouse Records was originally distributed through Lumberjack Distribution (also owned by Hemsath), then through the conglomerate Lumberjack Mordam Music Group (once Hemsath bought out Mordam), the latter of which signed a distribution deal with WEA in November 2004, which became effective on January 1, 2005. As part of the WAE deal, Hemsath negotiated an &quot;upstream&quot; clause to promote and develop select Doghouse Records bands to major record label Warner Music Group; as such, and through a financial agreement between the two parties, Doghouse Records became an affiliate of Warner Music Group. Later in 2005, Doghouse Records relocated to New York City.

In 2005, the label released a Bob Dylan tribute album, featuring bands on its roster as well as artists such as P.O.S and Sparta vocalist Jim Ward.

<text>BK channels (big potassium), are large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, also known as Maxi-K, slo1, or Kca1.1. BK channels are voltage-gated potassium channels that conduct large amounts of potassium ions (K+) across the cell membrane, hence their name, &quot;big potassium&quot;. These channels can be activated (opened) by either electrical means, or by increasing Ca2+ concentrations in the cell. BK channels help regulate physiological processes, such as circadian behavioral rhythms and neuronal excitability. BK channels are also involved in many processes in the body, as it is a channel. They have a tetrameric structure that is composed of a transmembrane domain, voltage sensing domain, potassium channel domain, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, with many X-ray structures for reference. Their function is to repolarize the membrane potential by allowing for potassium to flow outward, in response to a depolarization or increase in calcium levels.

== Structure ==
Structurally, BK channels are homologous to voltage- and ligand-gated potassium channels, having a voltage sensor and pore as the membrane-spanning domain and a cytosolic domain for the binding of intracellular calcium and magnesium. Each monomer of the channel-forming alpha subunit is the product of the KCNMA1 gene (also known as Slo1). The Slo1 subunit has three main structural domains, each with a distinct function: 

* the voltage sensing domain (VSD) senses membrane potential across the membrane, 
* the cytosolic domain (senses calcium concentration, Ca²⁺ ions), and 
* the pore-gate domain (PGD) which opens and closes to regulate potassium permeation. 

The activation gate resides in the PGD, which is located at either the cytosolic side of S6 or the selectivity filter (selectivity is the preference of a channel to conduct a specific ion). The voltage sensing domain and pore-gated domain are collectively referred as the membrane-spanning domains and are formed by transmembrane segments S1-S4 and S5-S6, respectively. Within the S4 helix contains a series of positively charged residues which serve as the primary voltage sensor.

BK channels are quite similar to voltage gated K⁺ channels, however, in BK channels only one positively charged residue (Arg213) is involved in voltage sensing across the membrane. Also unique to BK channels is an additional S0 segment, this segment is required for β subunit modulation. and voltage sensitivity.

The Cytosolic domain is composed of two RCK (regulator of potassium conductance) domains, RCK1 and RCK2. These domains contain two high affinity Ca²⁺ binding sites: one in the RCK1 domain and the other in a region termed the Ca²⁺ bowl that consists of a series of Aspartic acid (Asp) residues that are located in the RCK2 domain. The Mg²⁺ binding site is located between the VSD and the cytosolic domain, which is formed by: Asp residues within the S0-S1 loop, Asparagine residues in the cytosolic end of S2, and Glutamine residues in RCK1. In forming the Mg²⁺ binding site, two residues come from the RCK1 of one Slo1 subunit and the other two residues come from the VSD of the neighboring subunit. In order for these residues to coordinate the Mg²⁺ ion, the VSD and cytosolic domain from neighboring subunits must be in close proximity. Modulatory beta subunits (encoded by KCNMB1, KCNMB2, KCNMB3, or KCNMB4) can associate with the tetrameric channel. There are four types of β subunits (β1-4), each of which have different expression patterns that modify the gating properties of the BK channel. The β1 subunit is primarily responsible for smooth muscle cell expression, both β2 and β3 subunits are neuronally expressed, while β4 is expressed within the brain. 
The VSD associates with the PGD via three major interactions:
#Physical connection between the VSD and PGD through the S4-S5 linker.
#Interactions between the S4-S5 linker and the cytosolic side of S6.
#Interactions between S4 and S5 of a neighboring subunit.

== Regulation ==

BK channels are associated and modulated by a wide variety of intra- and extracellular factors, such as auxiliary subunits (β, γ), Slobs (slo binding protein), phosphorylation, membrane voltage, chemical ligands (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺), PKC, The BK α-subunits assemble 1:1 with four different auxiliary types of β-subunits (β1, β2, β3 or β4).

Trafficking to and expression of BK channels in the plasma membrane has been found to be regulated by distinct splicing motifs located within the intracellular C-terminal RCK domains. In particular a splice variant that excluded these motifs prevented cell surface expression of BK channels and suggests that such a mechanism impacts physiology and pathophysiology.

BK channels in the vascular system are modulated by agents naturally produced in the body, such as angiotensin II (Ang II), high glucose or arachidonic acid (AA) which is modulated in diabetes by oxidative stress (ROS).

A weaker voltage sensitivity allows BK channels to function in a wide range of membrane potentials. This ensures that the channel can properly perform its physiological function.

Inhibition of BK channel activity by phosphorylation of S695 by protein kinase C (PKC) is dependent on the phosphorylation of S1151 in C terminus of channel alpha-subunit. Only one of these phosphorylations in the tetrameric structure needs to occur for inhibition to be successful. Protein phosphatase 1 counteracts phosphorylation of S695. PKC decreases channel opening probability by shortening the channel open time and prolonging the closed state of the channel. PKC does not affect the single-channel conductance, voltage dependence, or the calcium sensitivity of BK channels.

== Activation mechanism ==

BK channels are synergistically activated through the binding of calcium and magnesium ions, but can also be activated via voltage dependence. Ca²⁺ - dependent activation occurs when intracellular Ca²⁺ binds to two high affinity binding sites: one located in the C-terminus of the RCK2 domain (Ca²⁺ bowl), and the other located in the RCK1 domain. The binding site within the RCK1 domain has somewhat of a lower affinity for calcium than the Ca²⁺ bowl, but is responsible for a larger portion of the Ca²⁺ sensitivity. Voltage and calcium activate BK channels using two parallel mechanisms, with the voltage sensors and the Ca²⁺ bindings sites coupling to the activation gate independently, except for a weak interaction between the two mechanisms. The Ca²⁺ bowl accelerates activation kinetics at low Ca²⁺ concentrations while RCK1 site influences both activation and deactivation kinetics. One mechanism model was originally proposed by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux, known as the MWC model. The MWC model for BK channels explains that a conformational change of the activation gate in channel opening is accompanied by a conformational change to the Ca²⁺ binding site, which increases the affinity of Ca²⁺ binding.

Magnesium-dependent activation of BK channels activates via a low-affinity metal binding site that is independent from Ca²⁺-dependent activation. The Mg²⁺ sensor activates BK channels by shifting the activation voltage to a more negative range. Mg²⁺ activates the channel only when the voltage sensor domain stays in the activated state. The cytosolic tail domain (CTD) is a chemical sensor that has multiple binding sites for different ligands. The CTD activates the BK channel when bound with intracellular Mg²⁺ to allow for interaction with the voltage sensor domain (VSD). Magnesium is predominantly coordinated by six oxygen atoms from the side chains of oxygen-containing residues, main chain carbonyl groups in proteins, or water molecules. D99 at the C-terminus of the S0-S1 loop and N172 in the S2-S3 loop contain side chain oxygens in the voltage sensor domain that are essential for Mg²⁺ binding. Much like the Ca²⁺-dependent activation model, Mg²⁺-dependent activation can also be described by an allosteric MCW gating model. While calcium activates the channel largely independent of the voltage sensor, magnesium activates the channel by channel by an electrostatic interaction with the voltage sensor. This is also known as the Nudging model, in which Magnesium activates the channel by pushing the voltage sensor via electrostatic interactions and involves the interactions among side chains in different structural domains. Energy provided by voltage, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺ binding will propagate to the activation gate of BK channels to initiate ion conduction through the pore.

== Effects on the neuron, organ, body as a whole ==

===Cellular level===

BK channels help regulate both the firing of neurons and neurotransmitter release. This modulation of synaptic transmission and electrical discharge at the cellular level is due to BK channel expression in conjunction with other potassium-calcium channels. The opening of these channels causes a drive towards the potassium equilibrium potential and thus play a role in speeding up the repolarization of action potentials. This would effectively allow for more rapid stimulation. There is also a role played in shaping the general repolarization of cells, and thus after hyperpolarization (AHP) of action potentials. The role that BK channels have in the fast phase of AHP has been studied extensively in the hippocampus. It can also play a role in inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters. There are many BK channels in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, thus highlighting their role in motor coordination and function. Furthermore, BK channels play a role in modulating the activity of dendrites as well as astrocytes and microglia. They not only play a role in the CNS (central nervous system) but also in smooth muscle contractions, the secretion of endocrine cells, and the proliferation of cells. Various γ subunits during early brain development are involved in neuronal excitability and in non-excitable cells they often are responsible as a driving force of calcium. Therefore, these subunits can be targets for therapeutic treatments as BK channel activators. There is further evidence that inhibiting BK channels would prevent the efflux of potassium and thus reduce the usage of ATP, in effect allowing for neuronal survival in low oxygen environments. BK channels can also function as a neuronal protectant in terms such as limiting calcium entry into the cells through methionine oxidation.

===Organ level===

BK channels also play a role in hearing. This was found when the BK ɑ-subunit was knocked out in mice and progressive loss of cochlear hair cells, and thus hearing loss, was observed. BK channels are not only involved in hearing, but also circadian rhythms. Slo binding proteins (Slobs) can modulate BK channels as a function of circadian rhythms in neurons. BK channels are expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is characterized to influence the pathophysiology of sleep. BK channel openers can also have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system. At a low concentration of calcium BK channels have a greater impact on vascular tone. Furthermore, the signaling system of BK channels in the cardiovascular system have an influence on the functioning of coronary blood flow. One of the functions of the β subunit in the brain includes inhibition of the BK channels, allowing for the slowing of channel properties as well as the ability to aid in prevention of seizures in the temporal lobe.

===Bodily function level===

Mutations of BK channels, resulting in a lower amount of expression in mRNA, is more common in people who have mental disabilities (via hypofunction ), schizophrenia or autism. Moreover, increased repolarization caused by BK channel mutations may lead to dependency of alcohol initiation of dyskinesias, epilepsy or paroxysmal movement disorders. Not only are BK channels important in many cellular processes in the adult it also is crucial for proper nutrition supply to a developing fetus. Thus, estrogen can cause an increase in the density of BK channels in the uterus. However, increased expression of BK channels have been found in tumor cells, and this could influence future cancer therapy, discussed more in the pharmacology section. BK channels are ubiquitous throughout the body and thus have a large and vast impact on the body as a whole and at a more cellular level, as discussed.

== Pharmacology ==

===Potential issues===

Several issues arise when there is a deficit in BK channels. Consequences of the malfunctioning BK channel can affect the functioning of a person in many ways, some more life-threatening than others. BK channels can be activated by exogenous pollutants and endogenous gasotransmitters carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and hydrogen sulphide. Mutations in the proteins involved with BK channels or genes encoding BK channels are involved in many diseases. A malfunction of BK channels can proliferate in many disorders such as: epilepsy, cancer, diabetes, asthma, and hypertension. Specifically, β1 defect can increase blood pressure and hydrosaline retention in the kidney. Both loss of function and gain of function mutations have been found to be involved in disorders such as epilepsy and chronic pain. Furthermore, increases in BK channel activation, through gain-of-function mutants and amplification, has links to epilepsy and cancer. Moreover, BK channels play a role in tumors as well as cancers. In certain cancers gBK, a variant ion channel called glioma BK channel, can be found. It is known that BK channels do in some way influence the division of cells during replication, which when unregulated can lead to cancers and tumors. Moreover, an aspect studied includes the migration of cancer cells and the role in which BK channels can facilitate this migration, though much is still unknown. Another reason why BK channel understanding is important involves its role in organ transplant surgery. This is due to the activation of BK channels influencing repolarization of the resting membrane potential. Thus, understanding is crucial for safety in effective transplantation.

===Current developments===

BK channels can be used as pharmacological targets for the treatment of several medical disorders including stroke and overactive bladder. There have been attempts to develop synthetic molecules targeting BK channels, however their efforts have proven largely ineffective thus far. For instance, BMS-204352, a molecule developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, failed to improve clinical outcome in stroke patients compared to placebo. However, there have been some success from the agonist to BKCa channels, BMS-204352, in treating deficits observed in Fmr1 knockout mice, a model of Fragile X syndrome. BK channels also function as a blocker in ischemia and are a focus in investigating its use as a therapy for stroke.

===Future directions===

There are many applications for therapeutic strategies involving BK channels. There has been research displaying that a blockage of BK channels results in an increase in neurotransmitter release, effectively indicating future therapeutic possibilities in cognition enhancement, improved memory, and relieving depression. A behavioral response to alcohol is also modulated by BK channels, therefore further understanding of this relationship can aid treatment in patients who are alcoholics. Oxidative stress on BK channels can lead to the negative impairments of lowering blood pressure through cardiovascular relaxation have on both aging and disease. Thus, the signaling system can be involved in treating hypertension and atherosclerosis through targeting of the ɑ subunit to prevent these detrimental effects. Furthermore, the known role that BK channels can play in cancer and tumors is limited. Thus, there is not a lot of current knowledge regarding specific aspects of BK channels that can influence tumors and cancers. Further study is crucial, as this could lead to immense development in treatments for those with cancer and tumors. It is known that epilepsies are due to over-excitability of neurons, which BK channels have a large impact on controlling hyperexcitability. Therefore, understanding could influence the treatment of epilepsy. Overall, BK channels are a target for future pharmacological agents that can be used for benevolent treatments of disease.

<text>Robert Desnos (; 4 July 1900 – 8 June 1945) was a French poet who played a key role in the Surrealist movement.

== Early life ==
Robert Desnos was born in Paris on 4 July 1900, the son of a licensed dealer in game and poultry at the &quot;Halles&quot; market. 
Desnos attended commercial college, and started work as a clerk. He also worked as an amanuensis for journalist Jean de Bonnefon. After that he worked as a literary columnist for the newspaper &quot;Paris-Soir&quot;.

==Career==
The first poems by Desnos to appear in print were published in 1917 in &quot;La Tribune des Jeunes&quot; (Platform for Youth) and in 1919 in the avant-garde review &quot;Le Trait d&#x27;union&quot; (Hyphen), and also the same year in the Dadaist magazine &quot;Littérature&quot;. In 1922 he published his first book, a collection of surrealistic aphorisms, with the title Rrose Sélavy (the name adopted as an &quot;alternative persona&quot; by the avant-garde French artist Marcel Duchamp; a pun on &quot;Eros, c&#x27;est la vie&quot;).

In 1919 he met the poet Benjamin Péret, who introduced him to the Paris Dada group and André Breton, with whom he soon became friends. In 1920, he did his military service which led him to Chaumont and then Morocco. 

While working as a literary columnist for &quot;Paris-Soir&quot;, Desnos was an active member of the Surrealist group and developed a particular talent for automatic writing. He, together with writers such as Louis Aragon and Paul Éluard, would form the literary vanguard of surrealism. André Breton included two photographs of Desnos sleeping in his surrealist novel &quot;Nadja&quot;. Although he was praised by Breton in his 1924 &quot;Manifeste du Surréalisme&quot; for being the movement&#x27;s &quot;prophet&quot;, Desnos disagreed with Surrealism&#x27;s involvement in communist politics, which caused a rift between him and Breton. Desnos continued work as a columnist.

In 1926 he composed &quot;The Night of Loveless Nights&quot;, a lyric poem dealing with solitude curiously written in classic quatrains, which makes it more like Baudelaire than Breton. It was illustrated by his close friend and fellow surrealist Georges Malkine. Desnos fell in love with Yvonne George, a singer whose obsessed fans made his love impossible. He wrote several poems for her, as well as the erotic surrealist novel &quot;La liberté ou l&#x27;amour!&quot; (1927). Critic Ray Keenoy describes &quot;La liberté ou l&#x27;amour!&quot; as &quot;literary and lyrical in its outpourings of sexual delirium&quot;.

By 1929 Breton definitively condemned Desnos, who in turn joined Georges Bataille and &quot;Documents&quot;, as one of the authors to sign &quot;Un Cadavre&quot; (A Corpse) attacking &quot;le bœuf Breton&quot; (Breton the ox or Breton the oaf). He wrote articles on &quot;Modern Imagery&quot;, &quot;Avant-garde Cinema&quot; (1929, issue 7), &quot;Pygmalion and the Sphinx&quot; (1930, issue 1), and Sergei Eisenstein, the Soviet filmmaker, on his film titled &quot;The General Line&quot; (1930, issue 4).

His career in radio began in 1932 with a show dedicated to Fantômas. During that time, he became friends with Picasso, Hemingway, Artaud and John Dos Passos; published many critical reviews on jazz and cinema; and became increasingly involved in politics. He wrote for many periodicals, including &quot;Littérature&quot;, &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot; and &quot;Variétés&quot;. Besides his numerous collections of poems, he published three novels, &quot;Deuil pour deuil&quot; (1924), &quot;La Liberté ou l&#x27;amour!&quot; (1927) and &quot;Le vin est tiré&quot; (1943); a play, &quot;La Place de l&#x27;étoile&quot; (1928; revised 1944); and a film script, &quot;L&#x27;Étoile de mer&quot; (1928), which was directed by Man Ray that same year.

==Resistance and deportation==

During World War II, Desnos was an active member of the French Résistance network Réseau AGIR, under the direction of Michel Hollard, often publishing under pseudonyms. For &quot;Réseau Agir&quot;, Desnos provided information collected during his job at the journal &quot;Aujourd&#x27;hui&quot; and made false identity papers, and was arrested by the Gestapo on 22 February 1944.

He was first deported to the German concentration camps of Auschwitz in occupied Poland, then Buchenwald, Flossenburg in Germany and finally to Terezín (Theresienstadt) in occupied Czechoslovakia in 1945.

Desnos died in Malá pevnost, which was an inner part of Terezín used only for political prisoners, from typhoid, a month after the camp&#x27;s liberation. There is a moving anecdote about Desnos&#x27;s last days after the liberation while being tended to by a young Czech medical student, Josef Stuna, who recognised him thanks to reading Breton&#x27;s &quot;Nadja&quot;.

Susan Griffin relates a story, previously recounted slightly differently in an article by her that appears in González Yuen, that exemplifies Desnos&#x27; surrealist mindset; his capacity to envisage solutions that defy conventional logic:
===Legend of &quot;The Last Poem&quot;===

A so-called &quot;Last Poem&quot; (&quot;Dernier poème&quot;) has been published numerous times; it was even set to music by Francis Poulenc in 1956. However, this poem never existed. The belief in its existence started after a misunderstanding. A Czech newspaper &quot;Svobodné noviny&quot; (Free Newspaper) published his obituary which ended with the sentence &quot;In a strange, tragic way his verses have fulfilled&quot; followed by a quote from Desnos&#x27; poem &quot;I Dreamt About You So Much&quot; translated by a Czech poet Jindřich Hořejší and printed in six lines. When re-published in France in &quot;Les Lettres Françaises&quot;, the sentence was translated in a completely wrong way: &quot;A strange and tragic fate gave a concrete meaning to a poem, the only one found with him and dedicated probably to his spouse&quot; followed by an erroneous translation of the aforementioned verses (furthermore, the translation excluded the last line of the Czech translation). Due to this the legend of &quot;The Last Poem&quot; survived well into the 1970s. It was thanks to a Czech translator Adolf Kroupa and his two well-founded articles in &quot;Les Lettres Françaises&quot; (June 1960, August 1970) that this false belief in the poem started to cease to exist.

==Personal life==

Desnos was married to Youki Desnos, formerly Lucie Badoud, nicknamed &quot;Youki&quot; (&quot;snow&quot;) by her lover Tsuguharu Foujita before she left him for Desnos. Desnos wrote several poems about her. One of his most famous poems is &quot;Letter to Youki&quot;, written after his arrest.

==Death==
Desnos died in Malá pevnost, at Terezín, used exclusively for political prisoners, a month after the camp&#x27;s liberation. There is a moving anecdote about Desnos&#x27;s last days after the liberation while being tended to by Josef Stuna, a young Czech medical student who recognised him thanks to reading Breton&#x27;s novel, &quot;Nadja&quot;.

Desnos died on 8 June 1945, aged 44 of typhoid at Theresienstadt concentration camp, Czechoslovakia.

He is buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris.

==Legacy==
Desnos&#x27; poetry has been set to music by a number of composers, including Witold Lutosławski with &quot;Les Espaces du sommeil&quot; (1975) and &quot;Chantefleurs et Chantefables&quot; (1991), Francis Poulenc (&quot;Dernier poème&quot;, 1956) and Henri Dutilleux with &quot;Le Temps l&#x27;Horloge&quot; (2007). A selection from &quot;Chantefleurs et Chantefables&quot; was set by Jean Wiener. Carolyn Forché has translated his poetry and names Desnos as a significant influence on her own work. Dutch composer Marjo Tal set several of Desnos’ poems to music.

In 1974, at the urging of Robert Desnos&#x27; widow, Joan Miró published an &quot;illustrated book&quot; with text from Robert Desnos titled &quot;Les pénalités de l&#x27;enfer ou les nouvelles Hébrides&quot; (The Penalties of Hell or The New Hebrides), Maeght Editeur, Paris, 1974. It was a set of 25 lithographs, five in black, and the others in colors.

In 2006, the book was displayed in &quot;Joan Miró, Illustrated Books&quot; at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic said it is &quot;an especially powerful set, not only for the rich imagery but also for the story behind the book&#x27;s creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature Miró&#x27;s familiar shapes, there&#x27;s an unusual emphasis on texture.&quot; The critic continued, &quot;I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that&#x27;s in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Miró&#x27;s work. Their poignancy is even greater, I think, when you read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a livre d&#x27;artist. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish civil war and World War II. Desnos&#x27; bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Theresienstadt, and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945. Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos&#x27; widow, Miró set out to illustrate the poet&#x27;s manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration.&quot;

A reading of &quot;Relation d&#x27;un Rêve&quot; (Description of a Dream) recorded by Desnos for radio broadcast in 1938 can be heard on the audiobook CD &quot;Surrealism Reviewed&quot;, issued in 2002.

In 2023 a novel, &quot;Traitor Comet&quot;, was published as the first in a series on Desnos&#x27;s life and his friendship with the poet Antonin Artaud.The sequel, &quot;L&#x27;Etoile de Mer (The Starfish)&quot;, was published in November 2024, and continues the story of Desnos as he defies André Breton and becomes obsessed with the wife of Tsuguharu Foujita, (later to become Desnos&#x27;s wife), Youki.

<text>Wasit Governorate () is a governorate in eastern Iraq, south-east of Baghdad and bordering Iran. Prior to 1976 it was known as Kut Province. Major cities include the capital Al-Kut, Al-Hai and Al-Suwaira. The governorate contains the Mesopotamian Marshes of Shuwayja, Al-Attariyah, and Hor Aldelmj. Its name comes from the Arabic word meaning &quot;middle&quot;, as the former city of Wasit lay along the Tigris about midway between Baghdad and Basra. Wasit city was abandoned after the Tigris shifted course.

==History==
The ancient Sumerian city-state of Der is located near the town of Badra.

The governorate experienced heavy fighting in the Iran–Iraq War, specifically the Battle of the Marshes.

During the Iraq spring fighting of 2004, the Mahdi Army briefly took control of the capital Kut, from April 6 to April 16, before being defeated by US forces.

==Demographics==
The population is approximately 1,450,000. The majority are Shia Arabs. The marshes have traditionally been home to many Marsh Arabs. There are also Feyli Kurds in the eastern town of Badra. A small Feyli Kurd community exists east of Kut.

As of 2007, the unemployment rate is 10% and the poverty rate 35%.

<text>Muthanna Governorate ( &quot;Al Muthannā&quot;) or Al Muthanna Province, is a province in Iraq, named after the 7th-century Arab general al-Muthanna ibn Haritha. It is in the south of the country, bordering Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The provincial capital is the city of Samawah. It has the highest poverty rate in Iraq, with a rate of 52%.

==History==
Before 1976 it was part of the Diwaniya Province, which included present-day Najaf Governorate and al-Qādisiyyah Governorate.

Samawah is very close to the ancient Sumerian-Babylonian city of Uruk (Aramaic: &quot;Erech&quot;), which is possibly the source of the name Iraq. After the decline of Babylon following the Seleucid founding of Seleucia, Uruk became the largest city in southern Babylonia, and its name (&quot;Erech&quot;) came to replace &quot;Babili&quot; (Babylonia), as the city long outlived the former capital, surviving into the 7th century AD.

In February 1991 it was the location of one of the largest tank battles in history during the Persian Gulf War, the Battle of Norfolk.

<text>A sanjak (, , &quot;flag, banner&quot;) was an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans also sometimes called the sanjak a [[Sanjak|liva]] (, ) from the name&#x27;s calque in Arabic and Persian.

Banners were a common organization of nomadic groups on the Eurasian Steppe including the early Turks, Mongols, and Manchus and were used as the name for the initial first-level territorial divisions at the formation of the Ottoman Empire. Upon the empire&#x27;s expansion and the establishment of eyalets as larger provinces, sanjaks were used as the second-level administrative divisions. They continued in this purpose after the eyalets were replaced by vilayets during the Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century.

Sanjaks were typically headed by a bey or sanjakbey. The Tanzimat reforms initially placed some sanjaks under kaymakams and others under mutasarrifs; a sanjak under a mutasarrif was known as a [[mutasarriflik]]. The districts of each sanjak were known as kazas. These were initially overseen by Islamic judges (&quot;kadi&quot;) and thus identical to their kadiluks. During the 1864 round of reforms, their administrative duties were given to kaymakams instead. Under the &quot;timar&quot; system of the early empire, fiefs held by timariot sipahis were also an important feature of each sanjak.

Sanjaks were initially carried over into the Republic of Turkey before being reorganized as provinces () in the 1920s.
==Names==
&quot;Sanjak&quot; () is one English transcription of the Ottoman Turkish name (). The modern transcription varies as modern Turkish uses the letter for the sound . The name originally meant &quot;flag&quot; or &quot;banner&quot;, derived from Proto-Turkic reconstructed as *&quot;sančgak&quot; (&quot;lance&quot;, &quot;spear&quot;) from the streamers attached by Turkish riders. Shared banners were a common organization for Eurasian nomads, were used similarly by the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s &quot;banda&quot;, and continue to be used as the name for administrative divisions in Inner Mongolia and Tuva. Alternative English spellings include &quot;sanjac&quot;, &quot;sanjack&quot;, &quot;sandjak&quot;, &quot;sanjaq&quot;, &quot;sinjaq&quot;, &quot;sangiaq&quot;, and &quot;zanzack&quot;, although these are now all obsolete or archaic. Sanjaks have also been known as &quot;sanjakships&quot; and &quot;sanjakates&quot;, although these more appropriately refer to the office of a sanjakbey.

Sanjaks were also known as () from their name&#x27;s calque in Arabic (, ) and Persian. In the other languages of the Ottoman Empire, they were known as (, &quot;province&quot;) in Armenian; as (, &quot;province&quot;) in Bulgarian; as (), (), (, &quot;diocese&quot;), (, &quot;eparchy&quot;) in Greek; and as in Ladino.

==Ottoman Empire==
===History===
The first sanjaks appear to have been created by Orhan or earlier. These were Sultan-öyügü (later Sultan-önü), Hudavendigar-eli, Koca-eli and Karasi-eli.

The districts which made up an eyalet were known as sanjaks, each under the command of a sanjak-bey. The number of sanjaks in each eyalet varied considerably. In 1609, Ayn Ali noted that Rumelia Eyalet had 24 sanjaks, but that six of these in the Peloponnesos had been detached to form the separate Morea Eyalet. Anatolia had 14 sanjaks and the Damascus Eyalet had 11. There were, in addition, several eyalets where there was no formal division into sanjaks. These, in Ayn Ali&#x27;s list were Basra and part of the Baghdad, Al-Hasa, Egypt, Tripoli, Tunis and Algiers. He adds to the list Yemen, with the note that ‘at the moment the Imams have usurped control’. These eyalets were, however, exceptional: the typical pattern was the eyalet subdivided into sanjaks. By the 16th century, these presented a rational administrative pattern of territories, based usually around the town or settlement from which the sanjak took its name, and with a population of perhaps 100,000.

However, this had not always been the case. It seems more likely that before the mid-15th century, the most important factor in determining the pattern of sanjaks was the existence of former lordships and principalities, and of areas where marcher lords had acquired territories for themselves and their followers. Some sanjaks in fact preserved the names of the dynasties that had ruled there before the Ottoman conquest.

In 1609, Ayn Ali made a note on their formal status. In listing the sanjaks in the Diyarbekir Eyalet, he notes that it had ten ‘Ottoman districts’ and, in addition, eight ‘districts of the Kurdish lords’. In these cases, when a lord died, the governorship did not go to an outsider, but to his son. In other respects, however, they resembled normal Ottoman sanjaks, in that the revenues were registered and allocated to fief holders who went to war under their lord. In addition, however, Ayn Ali noted that there were five ‘sovereign sanjaks’, which their lords disposed of ‘as private property’, and which were outside the system of provincial government. Ayn Ali records similar independent or semi-independent districts in the Çıldır Eyalet in north-eastern Turkey and, most famously, in the Van Eyalet where the Khans of Bitlis ruled independently until the 19th century. There were other areas, too, which enjoyed autonomy or semi-autonomy. In the second half of the 16th century, Kilis came under the hereditary governorship of the Janbulad family, while Adana remained under the rule of the pre-Ottoman dynasty of Ramazanoghlu. In Lebanon, Ayn Ali refers to the Druze chieftains with the note: ‘there are non-Muslim lords in the mountains.’ There were other autonomous enclaves in the Empire, whether or not they received formal recognition as sanjaks but, by the 16th century, these were exceptional.

In the 1840s, the boundaries of sanjaks were redrawn to establish equal units of comparable population and wealth. Each of these sanjaks was headed by a muhassil.

===Government===
The sanjak was governed as a vilayet, just on a smaller scale. The mutesarrif was appointed by Imperial decree and represented the vali, corresponding with the government through him except in some special circumstances where the sanjak was independent. In such cases, the mutesarrif then corresponded directly with the Ministry of the Interior. Most of the sanjaks throughout the Empire were under the rule of non-hereditary appointees, who had no permanent family of territorial connections with the area.

A sanjak was typically divided into kazas, each overseeing a major city and its surrounding hinterland. Initially, the civil administration was headed by an Islamic judge (&quot;kadi&quot;) and the area equivalent to his jurisdiction (&quot;kadiluk&quot;). During the Tanzimat reforms, the kadis were eventually restricted to judicial functions and administration ceded to a kaymakam and treasurer. The kazas were further divided into subdistricts (&quot;nahiye&quot;) and villages, each overseen by an appointed official or local council.

==Legacy==
===Occupied Enemy Territory Administration===
Following World War I, the sanjaks were used as the basis for the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. OETA South was formed from the sanjaks of Jerusalem, Nablus, and Acre. OETA Northlater renamed OETA Westwas formed from the sanjaks of Beirut, Lebanon, and Latakia, along with a number of surrounding subdistricts. OETA East was formed from the sanjaks of Syria Vilayet and Hejaz Vilayet.

===Mandate of Syria===
The Sanjak of Alexandretta was ceded by the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon to Turkey in 1939, becoming its Hatay Province.

===Liwas===
After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, the was used by some of its Arab successor states as an administrative divisions until it was gradually replaced by other terms like . It is still used occasionally in Syria to refer specifically to the former Sanjak of Alexandretta, known in Arabic as and still claimed by the Syrian state.

===Sandžak===
The unofficial geocultural region of Sandžak in Serbia and Montenegro derives its name from the former Ottoman Sanjak of Novi Pazar.

<doc id="463861" wikidata="Q213170" url="?curid=463861" title="Maysan Governorate">
<text>Maysan Governorate () is a governorate in southeastern Iraq, bordering Iran. Its administrative centre is the city of Amarah, and it is composed of six districts. Before 1976, it was named Amara Province.

==Etymology==
This region was called &quot;Messène&quot; () by Ancient Greeks (Strabo), &quot;Mīšān&quot; (ܡܝܫܢ) in Syriac. &quot;Mēs̲h̲ān&quot; in Middle Persian and Parthian ( myšn), &quot;Mēs̲h̲un&quot; in Armenian, &quot;Maysān&quot; or &quot;Mīsān&quot; () in Arabic, and &quot;T’iao-tche&quot; (Chaldaea) in the Han sources.

==History==
Alexander the Great founded the town of Charax Spasinu in 324 B.C. in the governorate. The town later became the capital of the Characene kingdom. It now exists as the ruins of Naysan.

The area suffered greatly during the Iran–Iraq War, during which it was a major battlefield, and again during the 1991 Iraqi uprisings led by the Shia population.

==Government==
===Ba&#x27;athist era===
From 1992 to 1994, Saddam Hussein appointed a senior military commander named Kamel Sajid, who had served during the Iran–Iraq War and led special forces missions into Kuwait, during the Gulf War, to become the governor, following a decision to replace all provincial governors with military ones. Under Janabi&#x27;s administration he reportedly introduced stronger Islamic policies, which coincided with Saddam&#x27;s faith campaign at the time.

Saddam Hussein&#x27;s brother-in-law who visited the province commented on Janabi&#x27;s administration, saying he had built a &quot;mini Islamic state&quot;. Janabi ordered the closure of all bars serving alcohol, and built several mosques across the province. He would also collect money for donations to the sick and poor, as well as visit hospitals. Janabi also reprimanded a police officer for allowing his car to cut through traffic, after the officer noticed it was the governor&#x27;s car. Locals reportedly referred to him as &quot;Abu Omar&quot; in reference to Umayyad Caliph Umar II, viewing Janabi&#x27;s rule as similar. He also reportedly spared the life of a Shia man who was cooperating with Iran in the province and had turned himself in to Iraqi security forces.

In 1994, Janabi was relieved from his position and sent to work for Saddam in Baghdad instead. Many Ba&#x27;athist officials criticized both Saddam and Janabi for their religiousness, and told Saddam that Janabi was a fifth-column element in the regime. However, Saddam dismissed these claims in his favor, and Janabi himself was reportedly loyal to Saddam.

===Post-2003===
The current governor is Ali Dawai Lazem, a supporter of Muqtada al-Sadr. As of 2013, he is the only provincial governor in Iraq belonging to the Sadrist Movement. Though he is a Shi&#x27;a, he is a non-sectarian and has said &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make a difference if you are Sunni or Shi&#x27;ite or Christian. I don&#x27;t differentiate between anyone.&quot; He has been called Iraq&#x27;s most popular politician.

In 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Dawai&#x27;s governance, stating that &quot;roads are being paved, new sewage systems installed and residents now enjoy electricity for up to 22 hours a day, far more than in Baghdad.&quot;

===List of governors===

==Demographics==
The vast majority of the population of Maysan is Shia Arabs. There exists a small minority of Shia Feyli Kurds that inhabit the northeastern part of the province, specifically Ali Al-Gharbi District, as well as a small population of Mandeaens and Christians. It is covered in the south by many Mesopotamian Marshes, and has traditionally been home to many Marsh Arabs.

In 2007, the unemployment rate was 17%.

<text>Lord Herries of Terregles (pronounced &quot;&quot;Heh&quot;-reez of Ter-regulls&#x27;&quot;) is a hereditary title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1490 for Herbert Herries with remainder to his heirs general.

On the death of his grandson, William, 3rd Lord Herries of Terregles, the male line failed. He was succeeded by his daughter Agnes, who married Sir John Maxwell, second son of Robert Maxwell, fifth Lord Maxwell. Their great-grandson, the 7th Lord Herries of Terregles, succeeded as third Earl of Nithsdale in 1667 on the death of his kinsman the second Earl. The earldom had been created in 1620 for Robert Maxwell, ninth Lord Maxwell. The third Earl&#x27;s grandson, the fifth Earl, took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715. He was attainted in 1716, his peerages forfeited and sentenced to death. However, he managed to make a celebrated escape from the Tower of London by changing clothes with his wife&#x27;s maid the day before his execution.

His granddaughter Winifred married William Haggerston-Constable, second son of Sir Carnaby Haggerston, 3rd Bt, of Haggerston Castle, Northumberland (see Constable-Maxwell-Scott baronets). Their son Marmaduke assumed the surname of Constable-Maxwell. In 1848 his son William Constable-Maxwell and the descendants of the fifth Earl of Nithsdale were restored by Act of parliament and in 1858 William Constable-Maxwell succeeded as 10th Lord Herries of Terregles. He was succeeded in 1876 by his son, Marmaduke Constable-Maxwell (married 1875 the Hon. Angela Fitzalan-Howard, daughter of the first Baron Howard of Glossop) as 11th Lord Herries of Terregles, who served as Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire from 1880 and Lord Lieutenant of Kirkcudbrightshire from 1885 until 1908 – he was created, in 1884, Baron Herries of Carleverock Castle in the County of Dumfries and of Everingham in the East Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title became extinct upon his death in 1908, as he had no sons. He was succeeded in the Lordship by his daughter, the 12th Lady Herries of Terregles, who married her first cousin once removed Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk. On her death in 1945 the title was inherited by her only son Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, who became the 13th Lord Herries of Terregles. When he died in 1975 the dukedom passed to his second cousin-once-removed, the 17th Duke, while he was succeeded in the Lordship by the eldest of his four daughters, the 14th holder of the title. In 1985 Lady Herries of Terregles married the cricketer Colin Cowdrey, created a life peer as Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge in 1997. Lady Herries died in 2014 when her sister, Lady Mary Mumford DCVO, heiress of the line, succeeded her as the 15th Lady Herries of Terregles. Following her death in 2017 the current and 16th holder of the title is her younger sister Jane Kerr, Dowager Marchioness of Lothian, widow of Conservative politician Michael Kerr, 13th Marquess of Lothian.

The Lordship is named after Terregles, in Kirkcudbrightshire in south west Scotland.

<text>News Probe is a documentary television programme in China Central Television that has aired since 1996. It attempts to investigate various news, issues, and scandals, aiming to reveal the social problems and the insufficiencies of state policies. Its Chinese title, &quot;Xinwen Diaocha&quot;, means &quot;News Investigations&quot;. Together with Oriental Horizon (), Focus Report ()and Tell It Like It Is () News Probe shares the similar reputation in documentary television programmes in China.

==Mission==
===General mission of CCTV News Programs===
*Authority ()
*Reality ()
*Richness ()
*Liveliness ()

===Additional mission of News Probe===
*Reporting the happening history and finding out the news in the news ()
*Encourage viewers to develop their own understanding of China problems
*Cultivate new generation of China being more sensitive and critical to diverse problems and dilemma
*Allow the audience to acquire a global horizon while viewing different issues in relation to other countries
*Initiate reform for societal progress

==Development==
The maiden broadcast of &#x27;Oriental Horizon&#x27;() on May 1, 1993, signified the start of the broadcast of commentary programme on current affairs. One year later, on April 1, 1994, a similar programme Focus Report(), which means a talk show on the hottest topics, was broadcast. At the prime time of 9p.m. on May 17, 1996, the first episode of News Probe-- &quot;Hongzhi Ban&quot;() was broadcast. The programme &#x27;News Probe&#x27; is produced as a result of the ongoing development of such kind of programme. The founders of &#x27;News Probe&#x27; expected this programme to report in a much detailed, in-depth, objective, systematic and authoritative way.

During the past developmental years, the production team found a position for the program. News Probe is thus aired as an investigative documentary, not only a commentary one.

The reason of setting up this position is due to the vast competitions from other news programmes in CCTV. Focus Report () provides detailed and universal description for different news events while &#x27;Oriental Horizon&#x27;() is good at rousing audiences&#x27; emotion during news reporting. Besides, the broadcasting time of News Probe is beyond all these news programs. Therefore, what News Probe can do is to provide innovative reporting methods so as to raise audiences&#x27; interests. As a result, an investigative reporting style was developed.

At the earlier stage of the program, the criteria on choosing the program topic are known as the slogan of &quot;Sanxing&quot; (), which means whether the topic is worth reporting, editing into program and investigating. However, in most cases, the three criteria are separately considered and only part of them are fulfilled. Afterwards, four methods of choosing a topic have been developed, known as the investigation on the theme, consensus, event and the inside skinny.

Being an investigative documentary, the News Probe raised the slogan of &quot;hunting the truth&quot;, which consists of 2 layers of meaning. Firstly, to 
uncover the inside skinny which is concealed by some people or organizations, and those secret incidents which harm the public interest. News Probe thus also includes some reports involving wrongdoings by governmental departments, such as corruption in the Chinese Police. Secondly, News Probe also aimed at providing deep discussion on the complex problems that being investigated.

The production crew does not aim at generating any conclusion for each episode. Instead, it allows the audience to make their own judgements after viewing the programs.

Since News Probe has been developed into an investigative documentary, it has its own characteristics:
*The reporters of News Probe must cultivate a sense of investigation
*The core part of the program is the process of investigation but not only the description of the event
*The investigation process is initiated by the suspension of reporters on certain events, and it ends when the suspension is proved.

To cut it short, the performance of the reporters during the investigation process determines the quality of the investigative documentary, therefore, reporters should be able to apply different methods depended on different situations in order to carry out a good programme .

Reporters of the programme must also reach several criteria of the production crew. They must be:
*rational in order to investigate the events in objective manners;
*able to exchange ideas and examine issues at the same time;
*able to look into issues in audiences point of view;
*fair to all the parties involved in the events and should be unbiased to certain parties; and
*able to raise questions towards every parts of the events

==Reporting style==
&quot;News Probe&quot; based on the framework of investigative reporting.
(refer to the second publication of &quot;News Probe&quot;: )

Through continuously questioning and criticizing a range of social issues, News Probe has developed a unique style and focused on lesser known aspects of China and the affairs of China in connection with other countries. Examples of issues explored include the proliferation of AIDS and SARS in China, the greenhouse effect, pollution in China and Germany (which is an episode in 1997), via interviewing the people involved and raising questions.

Investigation in each episode is initiated by reporters&#x27; suspicion towards the events. The reporters then start the investigation together with the production crew. Apart from reporters&#x27; own finding of the stories, members of the general public can also come forward with information through contacting the production crew directly, via the use of mail, news hotline and email.

Apart from interviewing the involved parties, the crews of &quot;News Probe&quot; also investigate issues by different methods, such as consulting powerful institutions (for example, they have consulted India Wildlife Conservation Society, Wildlife Protection Organization, India Wildlife Trade Association, International Convention on the Trading of Endangered species and Asia Wild Life Trade Research Committees in the episode of &quot;The death of Tibetan antalope&quot;) and people, referring to reference books and studying the issue&#x27;s history.

These empirical methods enable &quot;News Probe&quot; to investigate issues in an objective and unbiased manner. Each episode draws a conclusion from the evidence collected and the investigatory work done by the reporters and the crew.

==Basic composition of an episode==
*Narration: Process of the incidents and the truth
*Figure description: Experience of the main characters and description on his/her disposition
*Investigation: Internal and external reasons

==Production Mechanism==
The production crew of the program includes the following posts (in hieratical order):
#Chief Producer
#Secretary
#Producer
#Director
#Reporter
#Cameraman
#Recorder
#Post-production
#Coordinator

Chief Producer is responsible for the broadcast of the program, including the content of the program and the administrative work. Producer is responsible for the production of each episode and is accountable to Chief Producer.

The production of each episode follows the sequence stated below:
#Selection of topic
#Declaration of topic selected
#Investigation
#Recording of the investigation process

#Evaluation

==Topic criteria==
The production team has several criteria when choosing a suitable topic for each episode, including:
*it must be a story long enough to produce a 45-minute programme (cut into 30-minute in 1999)
*it must have special characteristics which can reflect some social changes
*it must be able to raise public concern
*there must be a truth behind the story
*it must be an exclusive discovery, including the story and the angle of view of the reporter
*it must be the first hand materials and not be reported by other news programs

==Broadcasting time==
Length of the program: about 40 minutes each episode

==Transmission area==
All of Mainland China, with an estimated audience figure of 100 million people.

==Example episode==
Name: Pay for innocent()

The government prosecuted a businessman, called Chan Yuen-Ho, over bribes. After his three-year imprisonment, the government released him because of lack of evidence.

&quot;News Probe&quot; resolved to find out the inside story of the case. After interviewing the involved people, they found that the government prosecuted Chan Yuen-Ho because Chan was inobedient in taking advice and orders from the government. He rejected the government&#x27;s advice of stopping external investment in his company.

Chan was insistent on his innocence and appealed to the high court continuously. He was released after three years of prison life. However, his company went bankrupt during these three years.

===Evaluation on the example===
&quot;News Probe&quot; has been a pioneer, providing a rare voice to investigate the
actions of the Chinese government. It has courage to interview the involved officials by asking to-the-point questions and let audience know the actions of the China government. 
It has allowed formerly voiceless persons to speak, and their Web site has allowed viewers to have their opinion heard. In this case, it gives a valuable opportunity for Chan Yuen-Ho to fight for the just response from the government.

<doc id="463872" wikidata="Q6678950" url="?curid=463872" title="Lord Balfour of Burleigh">
<text>Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in the County of Kinross, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1607 for Sir Michael Balfour.

He was succeeded by his daughter, Margaret, his only child. She married Robert Arnot, who assumed the surname of Balfour and sat as Lord Balfour of Burleigh in the Scottish Parliament in right of his wife. Their son, the third Lord, fought with the Covenanters at the Battle of Drumclog.

His grandson, the fifth Lord, was tried and convicted of the murder of schoolmaster Henry Stenhouse at Inverkeithing in 1709. He was sentenced to death in 1710 but escaped to freedom by dressing in his sister&#x27;s clothes. He was primarily known as Master of Burleigh, the title for the heir to the peerage, as he never took his seat in Parliament when his father died in 1713. He took part in the Jacobite rebellion in 1715 and was attainted for his role. He died childless in 1757.

The lordship had been created by charter, a copy of which exists only in the family archives. 
The original charter did not specify right of succession. Robert Bruce (1795–1864), MP for Clackmannanshire, asserted his right to sit in the House of Lords as Lord Balfour of Burleigh and Lord Kilwinning. However, Walter Francis Balfour of Fernie, a male-line descendant of the second Lord, opposed Balfour on the grounds that he was the proper heir as heir male of the body. Robert Bruce died in 1864 before the case was decided, but his wife continued the case on behalf of their underage son, Alexander Hugh Bruce. On 21 July 1868, the House of Lords ruled in favour of the Bruces, determining that the original lordship was created with the remainder to heirs general (as evidenced by it being inherited by the original lord&#x27;s daughter). On 19 March 1869, the attainder was reversed by Act of Parliament.

Alexander Hugh Bruce, the 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh, was the great-great-grandson of Hon. Mary Balfour (d. 1758), daughter of the fourth Lord, and her husband Brigadier-General Alexander Bruce. Since 1869, the lordship has been held by the Bruce family. Lord Balfour of Burleigh was a Conservative politician and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1876 to 1921 and was Secretary of State for Scotland between 1895 and 1903. His second son, the seventh Lord, was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1922 to 1963. , the title is held by his granddaughter, the ninth Lady, who succeeded his father in that year.

Another member of the Balfour family was James Balfour, 1st Baron Balfour of Glenawley (in the Peerage of Ireland). He was the younger brother of the first Lord Balfour of Burleigh.

The family seat now is Brucefield House, near Clackmannan. The original family seat was Burleigh Castle, near Kinross, which is now in ruins.

==Lords Balfour of Burleigh (1607)==
*Michael Balfour, 1st Lord Balfour of Burleigh (d. 1619)
*Margaret Balfour, 2nd Lady Balfour of Burleigh (d. 1639), married to Robert Balfour, 2nd Lord Balfour of Burleigh (d. 1663)

*Robert Balfour, 4th Lord Balfour of Burleigh (d. 1713)
*Robert Balfour, 5th Lord Balfour of Burleigh (d. 1757) &quot;(forfeit 1715)&quot;
*Heirs but for the attainder:
**Margaret Balfour (d. 1769), sister of the 5th Lord
**Robert Bruce, Lord Kennet (1718–1785), nephew of Margaret
**Alexander Bruce (1755–1808), son of Robert
**Robert Bruce (1795–1864), son of Alexander
*Alexander Hugh Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh (1849–1921) (restored 1869)

The heir presumptive is the present holder&#x27;s daughter the Hon. Laetitia Bruce-Winkler, Mistress of Burleigh (b. 2007).

<text>Antipolo, officially the City of Antipolo (), is a component city and capital of the province of Rizal, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 887,399 people. It is the most populous city in Rizal Province and in Calabarzon region, and the seventh most-populous city in the Philippines. It is also the most populated city under the component city status.

Its higher elevation than that of Metro Manila affords it a scenic view of the metropolitan area, especially at night. Its locally grown mangoes and cashews are popular among tourists, as well as suman – a local delicacy made out of glutinous rice. The Hinulugang Taktak National Park, which was once a popular summer get-away is being restored to become again one of the city&#x27;s primary attractions because it was devastated by a typhoon.

==Etymology==

The city was named after the breadfruit tree (&quot;Artocarpus blancoi&quot;) which in Tagalog is &quot;antipulo&quot; or &quot;tipulo&quot;, which was in abundance in the area. It is highly similar to the &quot;kamansi&quot; plant or &quot;Artocarpus camansi&quot;.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
Franciscan missionaries arrived in Antipolo in 1578, and built a small church on what is now Boso-Boso Church. They were soon replaced in 1591 by the Jesuits, who organized the village into a parish. By 1601, The Christian population of Antipolo had grown to about 3,000 as the indigenous Dumagat population dwindled and moved deeper into the interiors.

An uprising of Manila&#x27;s Chinese residents reached Antipolo in 1602. It led to the razing of the church.

On March 25, 1626, the image now known as the &quot;Virgin of Antipolo&quot; was brought from Acapulco, New Spain (now Mexico) by Governor-General Juan Niño de Tabora, who relinquished the image to the Jesuits for Antipolo&#x27;s church.

In 1650, the village was organized into a town and became part of Tondo Province. When the province was divided in 1853, Antipolo became a part of the District of San Mateo de los Montes, which later became the District of Morong.

Later in the 1700s, discharged soldiers and deserters (from Mexico, Spain and Peru) were providing Indios military training for the weapons that had been disseminated all over the territory during the British Occupation of Manila as they disperesed across the provinces surrounding Manila, uncluding Antipolo, Rizal.

The Recollects took over Antipolo in 1864. It was during these years that the Virgin of Antipolo gained a following of devotees. Devotees from Manila and nearby towns and provinces flocked to Antipolo on foot, carryinghammocks, trekking along mountain trails and springs.

===American invasion era===
During the First Republic, the town served as the capital of Morong, until it was occupied by the Americans on June 4, 1899; the Revolutionary Government then transferred Morong&#x27;s capital to Tanay. Soon after, the Americans established a civil government in 1901, Valentin Sumulong became the first municipal president. On June 11, 1901, Antipolo was incorporated into the newly established Province of Rizal, which included towns of Morong District and Manila Province. In 1903, the nearby towns of Bosoboso and Teresa were merged with Antipolo. The town&#x27;s territory was expanded again in 1913 to add the sitios of Mayamot and Bulao; just to lose Teresa six years later to become an independent municipality. The Manila Railroad Company (currently Philippine National Railways) inaugurated a railway service to Antipolo on December 24, 1908.

Long before the LRT Line 2 finally opened its services in Santolan in the Pasig-Marikina border in 2004, steam train services had once served those places in the past, even before World War II.

In Marikina, there is a street named &quot;Daangbakal&quot;, also called by the names of &quot;Shoe Avenue Extension&quot;, &quot;Munding Avenue&quot; and &quot;Bagong Silang&quot;. There is also a similar &quot;Daangbakal&quot; in the San Mateo-Montalban (Rodriguez) area, and on the maps one can notice that the two roads should have been connected with each other. In fact, as the name suggests in Tagalog, these streets were once a single railway line. The two sides of the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; roads were once connected by a bridge in the San Mateo-Marikina border. However, as the railroad tracks have been largely ignored after the Japanese occupation and was transformed into separate highways, the railway connection was abandoned.

The old railroad tracks, called the Marikina Line, were connected from Tutuban station in Manila, passing through Tramo (Barangay Rosario, Pasig) coming all the way to the town of Marikina up to Montalban. On the northern end of the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; road in Montalban is a basketball court. That basketball court which stands today, surrounded by the Montalban Catholic Church and Cemetery, was once the railway station terminus of that particular line.

The present-day Santo Niño Elementary School in Marikina was said to be a train depot. And also it was said that a railroad station once stood in the Marikina City Sports Park.

The Marikina Line was completed in 1906, and continued its operation until 1936. It was said that the Japanese Imperial Army made use of this railway line during the Second World War. These railways were dismantled during the 1960s and were converted into ordinary roads.

Today, the citizens are dependent on tricycles, jeepneys, taxis, UV Express services, buses and AUVs, which contribute to the everyday unbearable traffic of Metropolitan Manila. Even now there is uncertainty concerning the Northrail project, which is to link Manila to the northern provinces of Luzon, owing to corruption within the project&#x27;s construction.

Aside from the Marikina Line, two other lines have existed before but are now removed permanently. These are the Cavite Line, which passed through Paco, Parañaque, Bacoor and up to Naic, Cavite. Completed in 1908, its operation continued until 1936. The other is the Antipolo Line, which passed through Santa Mesa, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Cainta, Taytay, up to Antipolo near the &quot;Hinulugang Taktak&quot; Falls. Its operation ceased in 1917. There is a street named &quot;Daangbakal&quot; in Antipolo; there, as with the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; roads on Marikina and San Mateo, a railway line once existed. The railroad tracks also passed through what is now the Ortigas Avenue Extension.

===Japanese occupation era===
During the start of the Second World War in the Philippines, Antipolo became a refugee destination for many citizens from Manila and its suburbs who sought to avoid the Japanese invaders vying to occupy the Philippine capital. Also, two guerrilla units operated in the town against the Japanese. They were the Hunters ROTC under Miguel Ver and Terry Adevoso and the Marking Filipino and American Troops, which were established and led by Marcos Villa Agustin, more popularly known under the name Brig. Gen. Agustin Marking. Many inhabitants were tortured and killed by the Japanese, including Mayor Pascual Oliveros and his son Reynaldo, Padre Eusebio Carreon, Padre Ariston Ocampo, Sis. Ma. Elizabeth Cagulanas, RVM, Sis. Ma. Consuelo Recio, RVM; Ambrosio Masangkay, Alfonso Oliveros and Atty. Francisco C. Gedang Sr.

The liberation of Antipolo from the Japanese forces was bloody and devastating. On February 17, 1945, Mambugan, Antipolo was heavily bombarded by American planes. Antipolo residents evacuated to Sitio Colaique and up to the towns of Angono, Santolan and Marikina. To protect the image from being destroyed, Procopio Angeles, then the sacristan mayor, and members of the community brought with them the Virgin of Antipolo. The bombings on March 6–7, 1945, destroyed the church, and after twelve days of battle, the combined American and Filipino soldiers under the United States Army, Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary and aided the local recognized guerrillas of the Hunters ROTC and Marking&#x27;s Filipino-American Troops (MFAT) liberated the town on March 12, 1945. The general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was stationed in Antipolo from March 1945 to June 1946 was built today and operates during and after the war was fought the Japanese and they helping guerrillas and Allies. After the war, a temporary church was built and the Virgin of Antipolo was returned from the Quiapo Church on October 15, 1945.

===Philippine independence===
Religious devotees began to flock to the town, and on May 6, 1947, the first procession of the Virgin of Antipolo was held, starting at the hills of Pinagmisahan. In the following year, a national committee was formed to undertake a nationwide fund-raising campaign to rebuild the Cathedral of Antipolo.

On June 15, 1952, Hinulugang Taktak was proclaimed a National Park by President Elpidio Quirino, and on January 14, 1954, the Bishops of the Philippines proclaimed the Antipolo Church as the national shrine of the Virgin of Antipolo. In May 1960, vice mayor Maximo Gatlabayan and police chief Pio Tolentino were sentenced by Judge Cecilia Muñoz-Palma to 30 days in jail for refusing to follow a court order not to collect any fees from motorists making a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage.

In the 1960s, the town proper (&quot;poblacion&quot;) was widened and the Sumulong Highway was constructed. On September 12, 1969, Philippine Air Lines Flight 158 was flying from Cebu to Manila when it crashed into a hill at 760 feet in Sitio Colaique (or Kolaike) within Barrio San Roque, killing 45 of the 47 people on board. It was the worst aviation disaster in the Philippines at the time.

In the 1990s, the Marikina–Infanta Road, better known as the Marcos Highway, was constructed, traversing the mountains of Antipolo.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Antipolo was created on June 25, 1983, with Rev. Protacio G. Gungon, D.D. as the first bishop of the diocese.

===Provincial capital===
On March 4, 2009, a new capitol building was inaugurated in the city to replace the old capitol in Pasig.

On June 19, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11475, designating Antipolo City as the official capital of Rizal province, replacing Pasig that held the title since the province&#x27;s creation in 1901 even after its incorporation to Metro Manila in 1975. It took effect on July 7, 2020.

===Cityhood===

On February 13, 1998, Republic Act No. 8508 was enacted, Antipolo was converted from a municipality into a component city of Rizal Province on April 4, 1998.

====Highly urbanized city====
On March 14, 2011, then-President Benigno Aquino III declared the city as a highly-urbanized city by virtue of Proclamation No. 124, series of 2011. However, the proclamation has yet to be ratified in a plebiscite.

==Geography==

Antipolo is in the northern half of Rizal Province, close to its meridional center. It is located on the slopes of the Sierra Madre Mountain Range. Much of the city sits on a plateau averaging . It has the second-largest city area in the province, with an area of . The northern and southern sections of the city are in the dense forest areas of the Sierra Madre.

Antipolo is landlocked; it is bounded to the north by San Mateo and Rodriguez, to the east by Tanay, to the south by Angono, Taytay and Teresa, and to the west by Cainta and Marikina in Metro Manila.

The Bitukang Manok of Pasig—also known as the Parian Creek—had once linked the Marikina River with the Antipolo River before the Manggahan Floodway was built in 1986. The Parian Creek was actually connected to the Sapang Bato-Buli Creek (which serves as the boundary between Pasig&#x27;s barangays Dela Paz-Manggahan-Rosario-Santa Lucia and the Municipality of Cainta), the Kasibulan Creek (situated at Vista Verde, Barangay San Isidro, Cainta), the Palanas Creek (leaving Antipolo through Barangay Muntindilao), the Bulaw Creek (on Barangay Mambungan, besides the Valley Golf and Country Club), and the &quot;Hinulugang Taktak&quot; Falls of Barangay Dela Paz (fed by the Taktak Creek passing close to the Antipolo town square), thus being the detached and long-abandoned Antipolo River.

From the early 17th century up to the period of Japanese imperialism, over a thousand Catholic devotees coming from &quot;Maynilad&quot; (Manila), &quot;Hacienda Pineda&quot; (Pasay), &quot;San Juan del Monte&quot;, &quot;Hacienda de Mandaloyon&quot; (Mandaluyong), &quot;Hacienda Mariquina&quot; (Marikina), &quot;Barrio Pateros&quot;, &quot;Pueblo de Tagig&quot; (Taguig), and &quot;San Pedro de Macati&quot; (Makati), followed the trail of the Parian Creek to the Pilgrimage Cathedral on the mountainous pueblo of Antipolo, Morong (the present-day Rizal Province).

The Antipoleños and several locals from the far-reached barrios of &quot;Poblacion de San Mateo&quot;, &quot;Montalban&quot; (Rodriguez), &quot;Monte de Tan-ay&quot; (Tanay), &quot;Santa Rosa-Oroquieta&quot; (Teresa), and &quot;Punta Ibayo&quot; (Baras), had also navigated this freshwater creek once to go down to the vast &quot;Kapatagan&quot; (Rice plains) of lowland Pasig. Even the marian processions of the Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage passed this route back and forth eleven times.

The creek was also used during the British occupation of Manila from 1762 to 1764 by the British Army, under the leadership of General William Draper and Vice Admiral Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet, to transport their troops upstream to take over the nearby forest-surrounded villages of Cainta and Taytay. They even did an ambush at the &quot;Plaza Central&quot; in front of the Pasig Cathedral, and turned the Roman Catholic parish into their military headquarters, with the church&#x27;s fortress-like &quot;campanilla&quot; (belfry) serving as a watchtower against Spanish defenders sailing from the walled city of Manila via the Pasig River.

The Sepoys turned against their British lieutenants and sided with the combined forces of the Spanish overseas officials (assigned by the Governor-General Simon de Anda y Salazar), Filipino rice farmers, fisherfolk, and Chinese traders.

===Climate===

A popular custom of pilgrimages to the Virgin of Antipolo is the trek going to its shrine on the eves of Good Friday and May 1, from various locations in Rizal Province and Metro Manila. The most notable of these pilgrimages would begin the trek from the Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene (Quiapo Church), in Quiapo, Manila following the procession of the image.

<text>The Northern Dvina (, ; ) is a river in northern Russia flowing through Vologda Oblast and Arkhangelsk Oblast into the Dvina Bay of the White Sea. Along with the Pechora River to the east, it drains most of Northwest Russia into the Arctic Ocean. It should not be confused with the Western Dvina, with which it is not connected.

The principal tributaries of the Northern Dvina are the Vychegda (right), the Vaga (left), and the Pinega (right).

==Etymology==
According to the Max Vasmer&#x27;s &quot;Etymological Dictionary&quot;, the name of the river has been taken from the Western Dvina. The toponym Dvina does not stem from a Uralic language; however, its origin is unclear. Possibly it is an Indo-European word which used to mean &quot;river&quot; or &quot;stream&quot;.

In the Komi language, the river is called Вы́нва / Výnva from &quot;vyn&quot; &quot;power&quot; and &quot;va&quot; &quot;water, river&quot; hence &quot;powerful river&quot;.

The length of the Northern Dvina is . Together with its major tributary, the Sukhona, it is long – about as long as the Rhine in central and western Europe. The area of its basin is .

The river basin of the Northern Dvina includes the major parts of the Vologda and the Arkhangelsk Oblasts, as well as areas in the western part of the Komi Republic and in the northern part of the Kirov Oblast, and minor areas in the north of Yaroslavl and Kostroma Oblasts. The cities of Arkhangelsk and Vologda, as well as many smaller towns, many of those of significant historical importance such as Veliky Ustyug, Totma, Solvychegodsk, and Kholmogory, are located in the river basin of the Northern Dvina.

The Northern Dvina basin is roughly T-shaped. The -long Sukhona River flows east and joins the basin of the west-flowing Vychegda ( long). The combined river flows northwest into the White Sea, which it joins near the city of Arkhangelsk.

Looking more closely, the Sukhona flows east and meets the north-flowing Yug River at Veliky Ustyug. The combined stream, now called the Northern Dvina, flows north about 60 km and receives the west-flowing Vychegda at Kotlas and then turns northwest to flow into the White Sea. The Sukhona-Vychegda was an important east–west transportation route while the Northern Dvina-Yug was a north–south route. The upper Sukhona is now connected by the Northern Dvina Canal to the Volga–Baltic Waterway, which links Petersburg to Moscow.

===River course===
The Sukhona flows east, eventually north-east, joins the north-flowing Yug at Veliky Ustyug and acquires the name &#x27;Northern Dvina&#x27;. The P157 highway connects Kostroma with Kotlas via Nikolsk and Veliky Ustyug. North of Veliky Ustyg, the highway runs on the left bank of the Northern Dvina. The river flows about north crossing from the Vologda Oblast into the Arkhangelsk Oblast, where in the city of Kotlas it receives the west-flowing Vychegda River which rises in the northern Ural Mountains.

Since, at the confluence, the length of the Vychegda is greater than that of the Northern Dvina, the river between the source and the confluence with the Vychegda is sometimes known as the Lesser Northern Dvina (). Shortly downstream from the confluence, the Northern Dvina is crossed by the railway connecting Konosha with Kotlas and Vorkuta.

The Northern Dvina turns northwest and receives a number of smaller rivers such as the Uftyuga and the Nizhnyaya Toyma, both from the northeast. Near the urban settlement of Bereznik, the Vaga comes in from the south. At this point, the M8 highway which runs from Moscow through Vologda to Arkhangelsk, also enters the region. The Yomtsa or Yemtsa joins from the southeast, with the P1 highway (from Kargopol) running parallel.

The Pinega, formerly an important river route, joins from the east. Near the mouth of the Pinega, the river splits into several channels, among which is the ancient selo of Kholmogory southeast of Arkhangelsk. The branches rejoin and pass the modern logging town of Novodvinsk.

Downstream from Novodvinsk, the delta begins. In the upstream part of the delta, the great port of Arkhangelsk is located. It gradually replaced Kholmogory as the chief city of the region. On the southwest side of the delta is the naval base of Severodvinsk, the second-largest city in the region. The delta ends in the Dvina Bay of the White Sea.

The river flows through Velikoustyugsky District of the Vologda Oblast and through Kotlassky, Krasnsoborky, Verkhnetoyemsky, Vinogradovsky, Kholmogorsky, and Primorsky districts of the Arkhangelsk Oblast. All administrative centers of these districts are located at the banks of the Northern Dvina, as they developed when the river was the major transportation route of the region.

==Navigation and canals==

In summer, the entire length of the river is navigable and is heavily used for timber rafting. The Northern Dvina Canal connects it with the Volga–Baltic Waterway. In the 19th century, a short-lived Northern Ekaterininsky Canal, now abandoned, connected the Northern Dvina basin with the Kama basin as well. In 1926–28 a canal connecting the Pinega, one of the major tributaries of the Northern Dvina, with the Kuloy, was constructed, however, currently the canal is pretty much neglected.

Heavy commercial passenger navigation has largely disappeared and only local passenger lines remain. The passenger line connecting Kotlas and Arkhangelsk has been out of operation since 2005.

==History==
The area was populated by Finnic peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. The only exception was Veliky Ustyug, which was part of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. The rest of the Northern Dvina basin was controlled by Novgorod. Veliky Ustyug has been first mentioned in the chronicles in 1207, Shenkursk — in 1229, Solvychegodsk was founded in the 14th century. In the 13th century the Novgorod merchants already reached the White Sea. The area was initially attractive because of fur trading. The main waterway from Novgorod into the Northern Dvina was along the Volga and its tributary, the Sheksna, along the Slavyanka River into Lake Nikolskoye, then the boats were taken by land to Lake Blagoveshchenskoye, from there downstream along the Porozovitsa River into Lake Kubenskoye and further to the Sukhona and the Northern Dvina.

From the Northern Dvina, there were a number of ways into the basin of the Mezen (from where the merchants could get to the basin of the Pechora and the Ob). One was upstream the Vychegda and the Yarenga, and by land into the Vashka. Another one was upstream the Vychegda, the Vym, the Yelva, then by land to the Irva and to the Mezen. Two further options included going upstream the Pinega and then by land to the Kuloy and to the Mezen, or using the Pukshenga and the Pokshenga to get to the Pinega, and then from the Yozhuga taking boats by land to the Zyryanskaya Yezhuga and the Vashka. From the Vychegda, the merchants also could get directly to the river basin of the Pechora via either the Cherya and the Izhma, or the Mylva.

From the 14th century, Kholmogory was the main trading harbor on the Northern Dvina, but in the 17th century it lost this distinction to Arkhangelsk even though the seat of the Kholmogory and Vaga Eparchy, from 1732 known as Kholmogory and Archangelogorod Eparchy, which had jurisdiction over all Northern Russia including the Solovetsky Monastery, was located in Kholmogory until 1762. Until the 1700s, Arkhangelsk was the main trading harbour for the sea trade of Russia and western Europe, and the Northern Dvina was the main trading route connecting the central Russia with Arkhangelsk. Peter the Great drastically changed the situation, by founding Saint Petersburg in 1703, thus opening the way for the Baltic Sea trade, and by constructing the highway between Saint Petersburg and Arkhangelsk via Kargopol. The river quickly lost its role as the leading trading route, which was accelerated by the construction of the railway between Vologda and Arkhangelsk between 1894 and 1897.

The Northern Dvina was scene of several battles during the Russian Civil War, many involving the Entente interventionist army as part of their North Russia Campaign. A special Northern Dvina Flotilla existed during the Civil War.

<text>Transport Tycoon is a city-based video game designed and programmed by Chris Sawyer, and published by MicroProse on 15 November 1994 for DOS. It is a business simulation game, presented in an isometric view in 2D with graphics by Simon Foster, in which the player acts as an entrepreneur in control of a transport company, and can compete against rival companies to make as much profit as possible by transporting passengers and various goods by road, rail, sea and air.

Transport Tycoon Deluxe is an expanded and improved version of the original game, released in 1995. A version for Android and iOS was released on 3 October 2013 based on the sequel, &quot;Chris Sawyer&#x27;s Locomotion&quot;. A fan-made game engine recreation &quot;OpenTTD&quot; is also available. In November 2024, Atari acquired the IP rights from Chris Sawyer.
==Gameplay==
To start building a transport empire, the player must construct transport routes, consisting of stations near industries or towns, and in the case of trains or road vehicles, near physical routes. One transport route can utilize several different forms of transport, e.g. truck→ship→train. The player&#x27;s company and the individual stations each have ratings that depend largely on their efficiency at moving goods from one stations to the other. A station with high ratings may attract more goods.

The game begins in 1930, and ends in 2030. The player starts out by borrowing money to finance construction of transport facilities, and is charged interest until the loan is repaid. As the user plays the game and earns revenues, they have the choice of expanding service along existing routes, or expanding their transportation network. The game features a progression of technology: in any particular year of the game generally only contemporary types of technology are available. For example, railroad signals which allow more than one train to use a section of track are initially semaphores. Later, they are replaced by red and green traffic-light signals. Similarly, in the beginning there are only steam engines, but later diesel and electric engines are introduced. In the game year 1999, monorails become available. These require a separate track system from railroads. If the player remains in business until 2030, the game announces that they have won, allows them to post their name on the &quot;hall of fame&quot; and then continues. At this point, the year stays 2030 and never goes any higher, although the game can continue indefinitely. Playing the entire 100-year campaign takes about 40 hours. The game allows the player to save at any time, and multiple saves of a particular game at any point are possible.

Vehicles in the game must be constructed at corresponding depots, which must be connected to the road or rail networks. Towns and cities have their own road networks, but extra roads may be needed to connect them to other towns, or to various resources.

The player earns revenue by picking up resources or passengers at a certain station, and delivering them to another station where there is a demand for them. Demand is determined by the area which surrounds the station; for example stations close to towns will demand passengers. The revenues will depend on the delivery time, distance, and quantity delivered. The influence of these factors on revenue varies according to the type of goods being delivered. For example, mail will rapidly fall in value, meaning that it can only be delivered profitably over short distances, or over long distances very fast. On the other hand, coal loses value very slowly, so it can be transported in bulk over long distances whilst remaining profitable.

At times, subsidies are offered to the first company to move a particular resource from one place to another. This encourages the player to create a larger more complex transport network, rather than focusing on previously profitable routes.

The game features a system of Local Authority. Each city has a rating for every transport company based on the impact of their transport network. When the rating falls too low, the player will no longer be able to demolish buildings or construct new stations. The rating depends on, among others, the level of service and the deforestation caused by the company.

In the course of a game cities develop and expand according to various economic factors, and new industries (demand) or other resource sites (supply) may appear. Some natural resources may also eventually be exhausted and industries without adequate transport service may shut down. Also, new models of vehicles are introduced and eventually come to replace older models. At introduction such a new model will likely have improved characteristics, but may suffer from reliability issues.

== Music ==
The music in &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; are original compositions by John Broomhall. It features old-style blues and jazz tunes including parts of Herbie Hancock&#x27;s Cantaloupe Island.

==Reception==

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the DOS version four out of five stars, commenting, &quot;The best economic sim since &quot;Civilization&quot;, Microprose&#x27;s new &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; has all the features of Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; mixed with the look and ease of Maxis&#x27; &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; and a host of new features ... that give the game a feel that is all its own.&quot; He further lauded the game for its graphics, &quot;pleasant&quot; music, sound effects, addictive play, and realistic simulation of the growth of cities and towns.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the &quot;Transport Tycoon Scenario&quot;, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;A solid upgrade for a great game.&quot;

==Related titles==
A &quot;World Editor&quot; expansion pack was also released for the original &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, but was overshadowed by the Deluxe version released shortly afterward. It featured an alternative, Martian set of graphics, which did &quot;not&quot; appear in TTD.

===&quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;===
&quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; is an expanded and improved version of the original game. It included many significant changes, such as:

* 3 new gameplay environments alongside the original Temperate climate. These are: Tropical, Arctic, and Toyland. The new environments introduced different industries and challenges. For example, towns in the Arctic environment do not grow without regular deliveries of food, while those in the Tropical environment require access to fresh water before they will grow. 
* World Editor included - Allowing the creation of custom maps and scenarios. 
* Network play, allowing multiplayer games.
* Improved railway signals. The original &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; only included &quot;bi-directional signals&quot;, permitting trains to pass in either direction, while the Deluxe version introduced &quot;uni-directional signals&quot;, to restrict trains to a single direction of travel. This has significant effects on gameplay, as the original bi-directional signals could result in trains trying to travel towards each other on the same section of track. While this would not result in crashes on a properly signalled route, it did require either building extra track, to allow the trains to pass each other, or building a great many tracks in parallel, to avoid the problem. The new uni-directional signals enabled building one-way track systems, giving the player greater control over the operation of their rail network, enabling far more efficient routes, and preventing trains from trying to travel the &quot;wrong way&quot; on a section of track. By utilising both uni- and bi-directional signals, the player could now build effective switching yards, junctions, and other useful designs. It also enabled the building of continental-length railroad systems, by incorporating one-way tracks in both directions, as well as the option to merge other rails with the main line. This became a very popular strategy, allowing for transportation across entire game maps, resulting in larger profits.
* Maglev trains and track. 
* Buy/Sell Shares and take-over rival companies. 
* Heliports. 
* Ability to re-fit aircraft and ships to carry alternative cargo types.
* Games now begin in 1950 and end in 2050, while the original game covers 1930 to 2030. Accordingly, the Deluxe version loses many of the earlier vehicles from the original game, while adding several new types later on. Moreover, the vehicle names in the original game were based on real-life models, but were replaced with fictional ones in &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;, due to trademark issues.
* The Deluxe version also allowed players to rename their vehicles, stations and towns in-game; this can be useful for identifying services in a network and adding a personal touch.
* Remixed music theme for the main menu.

=== &quot;Chris Sawyer&#x27;s Locomotion&quot; ===

After the success of &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;, Chris Sawyer turned his attention towards a sequel, but during development he changed his mind and produced &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot;, which turned out to be a runaway hit. After &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot; was done, work on the third version was left to another development team, and Sawyer returned to work on a &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; sequel, &quot;Chris Sawyer&#x27;s Locomotion&quot;. It was released in September 2004 and was described by Sawyer as the &quot;spiritual successor to &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;&quot;.

It received poor reviews and was deemed a commercial failure on release, but sales through the digital releases are unknown. Regardless, there is an active &quot;Locomotion&quot; community that continues to produce modifications.

===iOS and Android version===
On 15 July 2013, Sawyer&#x27;s 31X Ltd and Origin8 Technologies announced that they were working on a mobile version of Transport Tycoon. Sawyer was originally focusing on funding for the game, but ended up overseeing the design and helped with the debugging. The game was released for iOS and Android on 3 October 2013. The game is single player and is primarily based on &quot;Chris Sawyer&#x27;s Locomotion&quot;.

=== Third-party creations ===

Several development teams are currently working to improve &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;. &quot;TTDPatch&quot; provides gameplay enhancements and numerous bugfixes to &quot;TTD&quot; by patching the original binary.

&quot;OpenTTD&quot; is an open source complete recreation of &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;, achieved by reverse engineering the original game. It delivers many bug fixes and general enhancements to the game, like making it possible to run &quot;TTD&quot; on multiple platforms, including Mac, Linux, PSP, and Android. While both games allow new graphic sets for vehicles and terrain to be used, at present, &quot;TTDPatch&quot; still requires the original &quot;TTD&quot; graphics, sounds, binary and music files to run. While &quot;OpenTTD&quot; can still use the original &quot;TTD&quot; graphics and sounds, it does not need any of the &quot;TTD&quot; files to run as it has free graphics and sounds.

<doc id="463879" wikidata="Q6678968" url="?curid=463879" title="Lord Belhaven and Stenton">
<text>Lord Belhaven and Stenton, of the County of Haddington, is a Lordship of Parliament in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1647 for Sir John Hamilton, 2nd Baronet, with remainder to his heirs male.

==History==
This branch of the prominent Hamilton family descends from John Hamilton (d. c. 1550), the illegitimate son of James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton, by Janet Calderwood, and half-brother of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran (from whom the Dukes of Hamilton descend; for earlier history of the Hamilton family see this title). In 1512 John&#x27;s birth was legitimized. His grandson, James Hamilton, notably served as Sheriff of Perthshire. In 1634 he was created a baronet, of Broomhill, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned second Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1647. The following year he was a member of the Scottish army in England that attempted to rescue King Charles I, and fought at the Battle of Preston.

As Lord Belhaven and Stenton had no male heirs, he surrendered the lordship to the Crown in 1675 and received a new patent with remainder to his kinsman John Hamilton of Pressmannan, the husband of his granddaughter Margaret, and in failure of that line to his heirs whatsoever. On his death in 1679 the baronetcy became extinct while he was succeeded in the lordship according to the new patent by John Hamilton of Pressmannan, the second Lord. He was the great-great-great-grandson of John Hamilton, brother of Claud Hamilton, grandfather of the first Lord. On his death the title passed to his son, the third Lord. He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1715 to 1721. The latter year he was appointed Governor of Barbados but drowned on the journey out. By Anne, daughter of Andrew Bruce, Merchant of Edinburgh he had four sons (1st. John, 2nd. Andrew, 3rd. James, 4th, Robert and a daughter Margaret). His eldest son John Hamilton succeeded to his father&#x27;s title, becoming 4th Baron Belhaven and Stenton, and died unmarried on 28 August 1764. His next brother Andrew having died unmarried in 1736, the title was inherited by the 3rd son James Hamilton, who became 5th Baron of Belhaven and Stenton. On James&#x27;s death in 1777, the line of the second Lord failed since Robert Hamilton, the youngest of the 3rd Baron&#x27;s sons, had died in 1743.

There now arose controversy as to the succession of the title. In 1777 it was incorrectly assumed by Captain William Hamilton, the great-great-great-great-grandson of John Hamilton of Coltness, younger son of John Hamilton of Udston, whose other son James Hamilton was the grandfather of the second Lord, and whose grandfather John Hamilton was the brother of the aforementioned Claude Hamilton, grandfather of the first Lord Belhaven and Stenton. William voted at the Election of Scottish Peers in 1790. However, it was resolved by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords in 1793 that this vote was not valid. The title was instead determined in favour of William Hamilton, the seventh Lord. He was the son of Robert Hamilton of Wishaw (who was adjudged &quot;de jure&quot; sixth Lord), grandson of Robert Hamilton, &quot;Younger of Wishaw&quot;, son of Robert Hamilton, 3rd of Wishaw, son of William Hamilton, 1st of Wishaw, son of John Hamilton of Udston, grandson of John Hamilton, brother of the aforesaid Claude Hamilton, grandfather of the first Lord.

The seventh Lord was succeeded by his son, the eighth Lord. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1819 to 1831 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Lanarkshire. In 1831 he was created Baron Hamilton of Wishaw, in the County of Lanark, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. However, this title became extinct on his death in 1868 while the lordship became dormant. In 1875, the House of Lords decided that the rightful successor was James Hamilton, the ninth Lord. He was the son of Archibald Hamilton, grandson of James Hamilton, younger son of the aforesaid Robert Hamilton, Younger of Wishaw. Lord Belhaven and Stenton notably served as Lord-Lieutenant of Lanarkshire.

He had seven daughters but no sons and on his death the title was claimed by his kinsman Alexander Charles Hamilton, the tenth Lord. He was the son of geologist William Hamilton (Member of Parliament for Newport, Isle of Wight), son of William Richard Hamilton (Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office), son of the Venerable Anthony Hamilton (Archdeacon of Colchester), son of Alexander Hamilton, younger son of the aforementioned William Hamilton, 3rd of Wishaw. In 1894 his claim was admitted by the House of Lords. He later served as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1900 to 1920. He was succeeded by his nephew, the eleventh Lord. He was an officer in the Indian Army and also sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer between 1922 and 1945. In 1934 he assumed the additional surname of Udny. However, none of the subsequent Lords have held this surname.

==Coat of arms==
The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the lordship is: &quot;Quarterly: 1st and 4th, gules, a mullet argent between three cinquefoils ermine (for Hamilton of Udston); 2nd and 3rd, gules, a man&#x27;s heart proper shadowed or between three cinquefoils ermine (for Hamilton of Raploch); all within a bordure argent&quot;.

<doc id="463882" wikidata="Q1279710" url="?curid=463882" title="Lord Saltoun">
<text>Lord Saltoun, of Abernethy, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1445 for Sir Lawrence Abernethy. The title remained in the Abernethy family until the death in 1669 of his descendant the tenth Lady Saltoun. She was succeeded by her cousin Alexander Fraser, the eleventh Lord. He was the son of Alexander Fraser and Margaret Abernethy, daughter of the seventh Lord Saltoun. The title has remained in the Frasers of Philorth family ever since.

The seventeenth Lord was a Lieutenant-General in the Army and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1807 to 1853. His nephew, the eighteenth Lord, was a Scottish representative peer from 1859 to 1866. His son, the nineteenth Lord, and grandson, the twentieth Lord, were also Scottish representative peers, between 1890 and 1933 and 1935 and 1963, respectively. From 1979 to 2024, the title was held by the latter&#x27;s daughter, the 21st Lady Saltoun. She was head of the Frasers of Philorth and was also one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999 (resigning her seat in the House in 2014).

The family seats are Cairnbulg Castle, near Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, and Inverey House, near Braemar, Aberdeenshire.

==Numbering scheme==
In the 20th century, it was determined that Margaret Abernethy (now 10th Lady Saltoun), succeeded her brother, Alexander Abernethy, 9th Lord Saltoun, in 1668, but only survived him by about 10 weeks and had not previously been counted in the title&#x27;s numbering. This new information has resulted in the ordinals in subsequent Lords Saltoun being revised. As a result, the later heirs to the title are often referenced with the incorrect numbering.

In reality this may be a point of law. Some transcripts note that Alexander Fraser (traditionally the 10th Lord) was legally recognised at the heir to his cousin, Alexander Abernethy, 9th Lord Saltoun. As such, by Act of Parliament confirmed by a charter from the King, this would make the first Fraser Lord Saltoun the legal successor of the 9th Lord, regardless of the status of Margaret Abernethy. As such there is argument that the traditional numbering should remain in use due to legal technicality. It must also be recognised that it has been known in the historiography since the 19th Century that Margaret Abernethy survived her brother. Sources from the time also confirm knowledge of her existence, yet Alexander Fraser was still confirmed as the 10th Lord, in succession to Alexander and not Margaret. As far as is known Margaret never assumed the title of Lady Saltoun in her lifetime and as such it seems bizarre to upend 300 years of history due to what could be described as a 6 week technicality.

*Lawrence Abernethy, 1st Lord Saltoun (1400–1460)

<doc id="463885" wikidata="Q2305269" url="?curid=463885" title="All-rounder">
<text>An all-rounder is a cricketer who regularly performs well at both batting and bowling. Although all bowlers must bat and quite a handful of batsmen do bowl occasionally, most players are skilled in only one of the two disciplines and are considered specialists. Some wicket-keepers have the skills of a specialist batter and have been referred to as all-rounders, but the term &quot;wicket-keeper-batter&quot; is more commonly applied to them, even if they are substitute wicket keepers who also bowl.

==Definition==
There is no precise qualification for a player to be considered an all-rounder and use of the term tends to be subjective. The generally accepted criterion is that a &quot;genuine allrounder&quot; is someone whose batting or bowling skills, considered alone, would be good enough to win them a place in the team. Another definition of a &quot;genuine all-rounder&quot; is a player who can, through both batting and bowling (though not necessarily both in the same match), consistently &quot;win matches for the team&quot; (i.e., propel their team to victory by an outstanding individual performance). By either definition, a genuine all-rounder is quite rare and extremely valuable to a team, effectively operating as two players.

Confusion sometimes arises when a specialist bowler performs well with the bat. For example, West Indies pace bowler Malcolm Marshall achieved ten scores of 50 or above in 107 Test innings between 1978 and 1991, but had a batting average of less than 19. He would be termed a &quot;useful lower-order batsman&quot;, or indeed &quot;a bowler who bats a bit&quot;. Equally, a specialist batter may be termed a &quot;useful change bowler&quot; and a good example of this is Australian Allan Border, who in a Test match against the West Indies in Sydney in January 1989 took 11 wickets for 96 runs (7/46 in the first innings and 4/50 in the second) as the conditions suited his occasionally used left-arm spin.

One of the main constraints to becoming a recognised all-rounder is that batters and bowlers &quot;peak&quot; at different ages. Batters tend to reach their peak in their late twenties after their technique has matured through experience. Conversely, fast bowlers often peak in their early to mid twenties at the height of their physical prowess. Other bowlers, mostly spinners but also fast bowlers who can &quot;swing&quot; the ball, are still effective in their later careers.

In 2013, Ali Bacher used statistical analysis to argue that there had only been 42 genuine all-rounders in the history of Test cricket. He rated Garry Sobers as the best, followed by Jacques Kallis.

==Categorisation by use of statistics==
One commonly used statistical rule of thumb is that a player&#x27;s batting average (the higher the better) should be greater than their bowling average (the lower the better). In Test cricket, only two players i.e., Garfield Sobers and Jacques Kallis, have batting averages that are 20 greater than their bowling averages over their entire careers. However, some other players have achieved such a differential over significant parts of their careers, such as Imran Khan who across 54 Test matches during the 1980s averaged 44 with the bat and 19 with the ball. Wally Hammond and Doug Walters managed differences of 20.7 and 19.2, respectively, between their batting and bowling averages, however, they were generally regarded as occasional bowlers who could break partnerships rather than genuine all-rounders. Based on an analysis of runs scored, balls bowled and wickets taken by batting position, it was suggested in a 2022 article that to be considered a genuine all-rounder, a player should average at least 49.3 runs and take at least two wickets per game – a record achieved by only 13 players in the history of test match cricket. 

In overall first-class cricket, there are several players with significantly higher batting averages. Statistically, few can challenge Frank Woolley who had a batting average of 40.77 and a bowling average of 19.87. Woolley took over 2000 wickets in his career, scored more runs than anyone except Jack Hobbs and is the only non-wicketkeeper to have taken more than 1000 catches.

Many all-rounders are better at bowling than batting or &quot;vice versa&quot;. Very few are equally good at both and hardly any have been outstanding at both. Thus the terms &quot;bowling all-rounder&quot; and &quot;batting all-rounder&quot; have come into use. For example, Richard Hadlee had an excellent bowling average of 22.29 in Tests and a passable (yet unspectacular) batting average of 27.16, leading him to be termed a &quot;bowling all-rounder&quot;, while the same can be said about Jason Holder and Chris Woakes. Meanwhile, a player like Jacques Kallis (batting average of 55.37 and bowling average of 32.65 in Tests) is known as a &quot;batting all-rounder&quot;.

Also, batting all-rounders may not bowl much due to injury concerns (e.g. Corey Anderson, Angelo Mathews), or their batting skills are far better than their bowling to begin with (e.g. Kane Williamson, Steve Smith) to the point they revert to being known as a batsman.

==Notable all-round feats==
* V. E. Walker of Middlesex, playing for All-England &quot;versus&quot; Surrey at The Oval on 21, 22 &amp; 23 July 1859, took all ten wickets in the Surrey first innings and followed this by scoring 108 in the England second innings, having been the not out batsman in the first (20*). He took a further four wickets in Surrey&#x27;s second innings. All-England won by 392 runs.
* On 15 August 1862, E. M. Grace carried his bat through the entire MCC innings, scoring 192 not out of a total of 344. Then, bowling underarm, he took all 10 wickets in the Kent first innings for 69 runs. However, this is not an official record as it was a 12-a-side game (though one of the Kent batsmen was injured).
* The first player to perform the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in an English season was W. G. Grace in 1873. He scored 2139 runs at 71.30 and took 106 wickets at 12.94. Grace completed eight doubles to 1886 and it was not until 1882 that another player (C. T. Studd) accomplished the feat.
* In the 1906 English cricket season, George Hirst achieved the unique feat of scoring over 2000 runs and taking over 200 wickets. He scored 2385 runs including six centuries at 45.86 with a highest score of 169. He took 208 wickets at 16.50 with a best analysis of 7/18. In the same season, Hirst achieved another unique feat when he scored a century in both innings and took five wickets in both innings of the same match. Playing for Yorkshire &quot;versus&quot; Somerset at Bath, Hirst scored 111 and 117 not out, and took 6/70 and 5/45.
* George Giffen (1886, 1893 and 1896) and Warwick Armstrong (1905, 1909 and 1921) achieved the double in an English season three times, the most by members of touring teams.
* Betty Wilson was the first player, male or female, to score a century and take ten wickets in a Test match. She scored 12 and 100 and took 7/7 and 4/9 against England at the Junction Oval in Melbourne in 1958.
* Alan Davidson was the first male player to take ten wickets and score one hundred runs in a Test match, though without scoring a century. Playing for Australia against West Indies at Brisbane in 1960–61, he took 5/135 and 6/87, and scored 44 and 80 in what became the first Tied Test. He was playing throughout with a broken finger.
* Twenty-seven players, on a total of 40 occasions, have taken five wickets in an innings and scored a century in the same Test match. Ian Botham achieved this feat five times, Ravichandran Ashwin, Enid Bakewell and Betty Wilson three times, while Jacques Kallis, Garfield Sobers, Mushtaq Mohammed, and Shakib Al Hasan have all done so twice.
* Betty Wilson (see above), Enid Bakewell, Ian Botham, Imran Khan and Shakib Al Hasan are the only players who have achieved the feat of scoring a century and taking 10 wickets in a Test match.
* In 2013, Bangladesh&#x27;s Sohag Gazi became the first, and so far only, player to score a century and take hat-trick in same Test match against New Zealand.
* Kapil Dev is the only player to score 5000 runs and take 400 wickets in Test cricket. He is also the youngest player to score 1000 runs and reach the 100, 200 and 300 wicket mark in men&#x27;s Test cricket.
* Viv Richards, Paul Collingwood and Rohan Mustafa are the only male players to have taken a 5-wicket haul and scored a hundred in the same One Day International. Fourteen more players have taken a 5-wicket haul and scored a half century in the same game in the format. Shahid Afridi is the only player to achieve this feat thrice in his career and Yuvraj Singh &amp; Shakib Al Hasan are the only cricketers to do so in a World Cup match.
* Amelia Kerr, for New Zealand against Ireland in Dublin in 2018, scored 232* (the highest score in women&#x27;s ODI history), sharing a second-wicket stand of 295 (the second highest in women&#x27;s ODI history) with Leigh Kasperek, and took 5/17 in the second innings.
* Jacques Kallis, Shahid Afridi and Shakib Al Hasan are the only three all-rounders in the history of international cricket to reach 10,000 runs and take 500 wickets across all three formats.
* In 2015, Shakib Al Hasan of Bangladesh became the first, and so far only, cricketer in history to be ranked the No. 1 all-rounder by ICC in its Player Rankings in all three formats of the game (Test, ODI and T20I).
* In 2024, Shakib Al Hasan of Bangladesh became the first, and so far only, cricketer in history to achieve both 14000+ runs and 700+ wickets in international cricket.

<text>Susan Howatch (born 14 July 1940) is a British author. Her writing career has been distinguished by family saga-type novels that describe the lives of related characters for long periods of time. Her later books have also become known for their religious and philosophical themes.

==Early life==
Susan Howatch was born on 14 July 1940, in Leatherhead, Surrey, England; as Susan Elizabeth Sturt. Her father was a stockbroker. As a child, she was educated at Sutton High School. Even though she was an only child and her father had died during the Second World War, she has often described her childhood to be a happy and satisfied one. After completing her school studies, she entered King&#x27;s College in London and obtained her degree in law in 1961.

In 1964, she emigrated to the United States, where she worked as a secretary in New York City. She married Joseph Howatch (4 December 1935 – 25 April 2011), a sculptor and writer, that year and began her career as a writer, finding success almost immediately with her intricately detailed gothic novels.
The couple had a daughter in 1971. Upon separating from her husband in 1975, Howatch returned to the UK, then moved to the Republic of Ireland in 1976 before returning to the UK permanently in 1980.

After her latter return to England, Howatch found herself &quot;rich, successful, and living exactly where I wanted to live,&quot; but feeling a spiritual emptiness that she ascribed to &quot;trying to hold my divided self together&quot; and questioning her life and what she should do with it.

She had settled in Salisbury out of love for the beauty of the city, but found herself increasingly drawn to Salisbury Cathedral; eventually she began to study Anglican Christianity in earnest. Quotations from contemporary Anglican writers, such as Glyn Simon, Bishop of Llandaff (1958–1970), often appear in her books as chapter headings. She experienced a spiritual epiphany, and concluded that she should continue to write novels, but to &quot;set forth my discoveries in the light of faith, no matter how feeble and inadequate my beginner&#x27;s faith was.&quot; This personal turning point culminated in Howatch&#x27;s most successful and popular works, the Starbridge series.

==Earlier novels and sagas==
Her first novel was &quot;The Dark Shore&quot; (1965). She published several other &quot;gothic&quot; novels before she turned to the first of her family sagas, &quot;Penmarric&quot; (1971), which details the fortunes and disputes of the Penmar family in Cornwall during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. An important theme of the story is how the mansion of Penmarric becomes controlled by various branches of the family. The family fortune was made in the Cornish tin mining industry, which is discussed throughout each one of the six parts, each with a different character as narrator. As is made clear by the chapter headings, the fortunes of the family closely parallel the Plantagenet family, including Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, with the mansion representing the throne. It was adapted into a television series with the same name in 1979.

Howatch wrote the novel at her kitchen table in New Jersey. Publisher Michael Korda wrote, &quot;It is a frequently stated basic belief of book publishing that somewhere in the country at any given moment some unknown woman is writing a major best-seller (usually referred to as &#x27;the next &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;&#x27;) at her kitchen table while looking after her baby, but this was the first time I had experienced the phenomenon in real life. Susan Howatch had written her massive novel with one hand on the cradle and the other doing the typing, but, like most authors who succeed, she had never doubted that her book would be a bestseller.&quot; Korda asserted that, while reading the drafts, he noticed similarities to the Plantagenets and asked Howatch if that was the case. She replied that Shakespeare had borrowed most of his plots from other sources, and asked Korda if he thought anyone would notice.
Howatch followed a similar theme in her vast saga, &quot;The Wheel of Fortune&quot;, where the story of the Godwin family of Oxmoon in Gower, South Wales, is in fact a re-creation in a modern form of the story of the Plantagenet family of Edward III of England, the modern characters being created from those of his eldest son Edward of Woodstock (&quot;The Black Prince&quot;) and his wife Joan of Kent, John of Gaunt and his mistress, later wife, Katherine Swynford, Richard II (son of Edward of Woodstock), Henry IV (son of John of Gaunt) and Henry IV&#x27;s eldest son King Henry V. Again the mansion represents the throne.

She also wrote three other family sagas, &quot;Cashelmara&quot;, which focuses on the family of Edward I (Edward de Salis), his son, Edward II (Patrick de Salis) and others; and &quot;The Rich Are Different&quot; followed by its sequel, &quot;The Sins of the Fathers&quot;, both of which combine to tell the story, in America&#x27; s financial industry, of Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Mark Antony, and Octavian.

==Starbridge series==
This series of six books sets out to describe the history of the Church of England through the twentieth century. Each of the six books is self-contained, and each is narrated by a different character. However, the main protagonist of each book also appears in the other books, allowing the author to present the same incidents from different viewpoints.

The action of all six books centres around the fictional Anglican diocese of Starbridge, which is supposedly in the west of England, and also features the Fordite monks, a fictional Anglican monastic order. The cathedral and ecclesiastical hierarchy at Starbridge are based on the real-life Salisbury.

The first three books of the series (&quot;Glittering Images&quot;, &quot;Glamorous Powers&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Prizes&quot;) begin in the 1930s and continue through World War II. The second three (&quot;Scandalous Risks&quot;, &quot;Mystical Paths&quot;, &quot;Absolute Truths&quot;) take place in the 1960s.

Glittering Images is narrated by the Reverend Dr Charles Ashworth, a Cambridge academic who undergoes something of a spiritual and nervous breakdown after being sent by the Archbishop of Canterbury to secretly investigate possible sexual transgressions in the household of the Bishop of Starbridge. Ashworth is helped to recover and to realize the source of his problems by Father Jonathan Darrow, the widowed abbot of Grantchester Abbey of the Fordite monks.

Glamorous Powers follows the story of Jonathan Darrow himself as he leaves the Fordite order at age sixty following a powerful vision. He then must deal with the problems of his adult children, address the question of a new intimate relationship, and search for a new ministry. His particular crisis surrounds the use and misuse of his charismatic powers of healing, and his unsettling mystical visions, or &quot;showings&quot;.

Ultimate Prizes takes place during World War II. It is narrated by Neville Aysgarth, a young and ambitious Archdeacon of Starbridge from a lower-middle-class background in the north of England. After being widowed and marrying again, he too undergoes something of a breakdown but is rescued by Jonathan Darrow.

Scandalous Risks follows Aysgarth to a canonry of Westminster Abbey and back to Starbridge, where he becomes dean of the cathedral and Ashworth becomes a bishop. It is narrated by Venetia Flaxton, a young aristocrat who risks great scandal by beginning a relationship with the married Aysgarth, her father&#x27;s best friend. The relationships, and Aysgarth&#x27;s family, closely echo the relationship of H. H. Asquith and Venetia Stanley.

Mystical Paths follows Nicholas Darrow, son of Jonathan, as he narrowly avoids going off the rails prior to his ordination while investigating the mysterious disappearance of Christian Aysgarth, eldest son of Dean Aysgarth.

Absolute Truths comes full circle and is narrated by a much older but still troubled Charles Ashworth, thirty-one years after he was originally encountered in the first of the books.

== St Benet&#x27;s trilogy ==
The St Benet&#x27;s trilogy takes place in the London of the 1980s and 1990s. Again, it illustrates the changes in the Anglican Church in those years and brings back many of the characters in the Starbridge series. However, while the church is still at the heart of the books, there is an increased emphasis on characters who are not members of the clergy. Like the six preceding books, each in the trilogy is written in the first person by a different narrator.

A Question of Integrity (given the title The Wonder Worker in the United States), picks up the story of Nicholas Darrow twenty years after the last of the Starbridge novels. Nick is now rector of a church in the City of London, where he runs a centre for the ministry of healing. His own life is greatly affected by events taking place at the centre, especially after he meets Alice Fletcher, an insecure new worker there, and is forced to reassess his beliefs and commitments as a result.

The High Flyer narrates the story of a City lawyer, Carter Graham, who &quot;has it all&quot;. Her outwardly successful life, complete with highly compensated career and suitable marriage, undergoes profound changes after harrowing events smacking of the occult begin to occur, which reveal that things are not what they seem.

The Heartbreaker follows the life of Gavin Blake, a charismatic prostitute specializing in powerful, influential male clients, who finds himself at the centre of a criminal empire and must fight to save his life. Meanwhile, both Graham and Darrow must deal with their own weaknesses in trying to help Gavin.

==Later life==
According to her publisher Michael Korda, Howatch was never comfortable with publishing popular fiction, and felt that it didn&#x27;t satisfy her intellectual and moral needs. He cites this as a reason for her shift away from popular fiction to more serious writing. For Korda, she became the only best-selling novelist to walk away from her own success or to leave her publisher because &quot;he had sold too many copies of her books.&quot;

Howatch has used some of the profits from her novels to found an academic post with the title &#x27;Starbridge Lecturer in Natural Science and Theology&#x27; in the Faculty of Divinity at Cambridge University, devoted to linking the fields of science and religion. The first holder of this post was the Reverend Dr. Fraser Watts, a psychologist and theologian. Dr. Watts was succeeded in 2014 by the Revd Dr. Andrew Davison, who previously taught at Westcott House, Cambridge.

Howatch is an Honorary Fellow of King&#x27;s College, London, the University of Wales at Lampeter, and Sarum College in Salisbury. In 2012, Howatch was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Hope College. She currently resides in Leatherhead.

<doc id="463890" wikidata="Q3259372" url="?curid=463890" title="Lord Borthwick">
<text>Lord Borthwick is a title in the Peerage of Scotland.

Alexander Nisbet relates that &quot;the first of this ancient and noble family came from Hungary to Scotland, in the retinue of Queen Margaret, in the reign of Malcolm Canmore, &quot;anno Domini&quot; 1057. A Thomas de Borthwick is mentioned in a charter of Sir Robert Lauder of Quarrelwood, in the reign of King Alexander II.&quot;
Sir William de Borthwick of that Ilk was created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Borthwick, (William Borthwick, 1st Lord Borthwick), but it is unclear exactly when the title was created. Nisbet states: &quot;there appears no patent in the records constituting this peerage&quot;.

Anderson supposes it dates from &quot;about 1424&quot;, Brown says 1438, Leeson gives 1452, and Burke&#x27;s and Pine actually give an exact date: June 12, 1452. However, Alexander Nisbet, writing as far back as 1722 states: &quot;this family was dignified with the title of Lord Borthwick in the beginning of the reign of King James II&quot; which commenced in 1437, which is closer to Brown&#x27;s assertion.

In the Parliament of 1469 held at Edinburgh by King James III of Scotland Lord Borthwick was ranked after the Lord Halyburton (cr.1441). In the parliament of 1471 he is the fourth Lord of Parliament ranked immediately after the Lord Glamis (cr.1445).

The chronology of the Lords Borthwick also presents problems as of the first seven, six were named William. Of the first Lord, Burke&#x27;s (1999) merely states: &quot;knighted before his father in 1430; one of the magnates who according to contemporary records habitually plundered the Customs. Married and left issue&quot;. Anderson states &quot;the first Lord Borthwick died before 1458&quot;.
His son, the second Lord (William Borthwick, 2nd Lord Borthwick), was an ambassador to England as well as Master of the Household to King James III. He was succeeded by his son, the third Lord (William Borthwick, 3rd Lord Borthwick), who some say was one of the many Scottish noblemen killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 although the &quot;Complete Peerage&quot; cited by Pine stated &quot;this was unlikely&quot;. His son, the fourth Lord (William Borthwick, 4th Lord Borthwick), became guardian to the infant King James V.

The ninth Lord, was a Royalist during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. However, on his death in 1675 the male line of the third Lord failed. The Borthwick estates passed to his nephew John Dundas, son of his sister Margaret Borthwick, while the lordship became dormant.

It was to remain dormant for the next 87 years. The right to the title, however, passed to the late Lord&#x27;s kinsman and male heir William Borthwick, the &quot;de jure&quot; tenth Lord. He was the son of William Borthwick, 5th of Soltray (Soutra) and Johnstonburn, elder son of William Borthwick, 4th of Soltray and Johnstonburn, great-grandson of William Borthwick, 1st of Soltray, son of the Hon. Alexander Borthwick, third son of the second Lord Borthwick. He never assumed the title.

His son, the &quot;de jure&quot; eleventh Lord, was a colonel in the army and was killed at the Battle of Ramillies in 1706. On his death the right to the lordship passed to his cousin Henry Borthwick, the &quot;de jure&quot; twelfth Lord. He was the grandson of Alexander Borthwick, younger son of the aforementioned William Borthwick, 4th of Soltray and Johnstonburn. Henry was a captain in the Scottish army and like his cousin fought at the Battle of Ramillies. He died from wounds received in action four days after the battle (and four days after his cousin). On his death the right to the lordship passed to his elder son William, &quot;de jure&quot; thirteenth Lord, and then to his younger brother Henry. The latter&#x27;s claim to the title was admitted by the House of Lords in 1762, and he became the fourteenth Lord Borthwick. However, on his death in 1772 the peerage became dormant again.

The claim now passed to the late Lord&#x27;s kinsman and male heir Patrick Borthwick, the &quot;de jure&quot; fifteenth Lord. He was the great-grandson of Alexander Borthwick, 1st of Reidhall and Sauchnell, younger son of William Borthwick, 3rd of Soltray and Johnstonburne, grandson of William Borthwick, 1st of Soltray, cited above. His son Archibald, the &quot;de jure&quot; sixteenth Lord, petitioned the House of Lords for the right to claim the title in 1808 but was unsuccessful. His son Patrick, &quot;de jure&quot; seventeenth Lord, was also unsuccessful when he tried to claim the title in 1816. However, his younger son Cunninghame had his claim to the lordship allowed by the House of Lords in 1870 and he became the nineteenth Lord Borthwick. From 1880 to 1885 he sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer. He married Alice Day, their eldest daughter was Gabrielle Borthwick, their son, the twentieth Lord, was a Scottish Representative Peer between 1906 and 1910. When he died in 1910 the peerage once again became dormant.

The claim passed to his distant relative William Henry Borthwick, the &quot;de jure&quot; twenty-first Lord. He was a descendant of John Borthwick, 1st of Crookston, younger son of the first Lord. His grandson John Henry Stuart Borthwick had his claim to the title admitted by the Lord Lyon in 1986, and he became the twenty-third Lord Borthwick. this ancient title is held by his elder twin son, the twenty-fourth Lord Borthwick, who succeeded in 1996. He is Chief of Clan Borthwick and also holds the baronage title Baron of Heriotmuir and Laird of Crookston.

The family seat is Borthwick Castle, near Borthwick, Midlothian but is leased as a venue for hire by the family.

<doc id="463895" wikidata="Q1277219" url="?curid=463895" title="Earl of Bessborough">
<text>Earl of Bessborough is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1739 for Brabazon Ponsonby, 2nd Viscount Duncannon, who had previously represented Newtownards and County Kildare in the Irish House of Commons. In 1749, he was given the additional title of Baron Ponsonby of Sysonby, in the County of Leicester, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which entitled him to a seat in the British House of Lords. The titles Viscount Duncannon, of the fort of Duncannon in the County of Wexford, and Baron Bessborough, of Bessborough, Piltown, in the County of Kilkenny, had been created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1723 and 1721 respectively for Lord Bessborough&#x27;s father William Ponsonby, who had earlier represented County Kilkenny in the Irish House of Commons.

The first Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a Whig politician and served as a Lord of the Treasury, a Lord of the Admiralty and as Joint Postmaster General. His son, the third Earl, represented Knaresborough in the House of Commons as a Whig and like his father served as a Lord of the Admiralty. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was a prominent Whig politician and served as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests, as Home Secretary, as Lord Privy Seal and as First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1834, ten years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Duncannon, of Bessborough in County Kilkenny. His eldest son, the fifth Earl, was a Liberal politician and held office under Lord Russell and William Ewart Gladstone as Lord Steward of the Household. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. He never married and on his death in 1906, the titles passed to his younger brother, the seventh Earl. He was a clergyman. His grandson, the ninth Earl, was a Conservative politician and also served as Governor General of Canada from 1931 to 1935. In 1937, he was created Earl of Bessborough in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the tenth Earl, sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served as Joint Under-Secretary of State for Education in 1964 and as Minister of State at the Ministry of Technology in 1970. He was later a member of the European Parliament. Lord Bessborough had one daughter but no sons, and on his death in 1993, the 1937 earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the other titles by his first cousin, who became the eleventh Earl. He was the son of Major the Hon. Cyril Myles Brabazon Ponsonby, second son of the eighth Earl. , the titles are held by his son, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded in 2002.

Several other members of the family have gained distinction. The Hon. John Ponsonby, second son of the first Earl, served as Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and was the father of William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby, and George Ponsonby, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Major-General the Hon. Sir Frederick Ponsonby, second son of the third Earl, was the father of General Sir Henry Ponsonby, who was the father of Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby, and Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede. The Hon. William Ponsonby, third son of the third Earl, was created Baron de Mauley in 1838 while Lady Caroline Ponsonby, only daughter of the third Earl, was the wife of Prime Minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, but is perhaps best remembered for her affair with Lord Byron. Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane, sixth son of the fourth Earl, was for many years Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Department and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1901.

==Family seat==

The present family seat is Stansted Park, near Stoughton, West Sussex, acquired by the 9th Earl in 1924. Previous family seats include Bishopscourt House near Bishopscourt, County Kildare, and Parkstead House in Roehampton, London. The family&#x27;s former main seat in Ireland was Bessborough House, built in the 1740s for the 1st Earl. Located near the village of Piltown in the south of County Kilkenny, the house was sold by the 9th Earl in the late 1930s. Bessborough House is now part of Kildalton Agricultural College.

===Present peer===
Myles Fitzhugh Longfield Ponsonby, 12th Earl of Bessborough (born 16 February 1941), is the son of the 11th Earl and his wife Patricia Minnigerode. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA. He is also a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

He was styled as Viscount Duncannon between 1993 and 5 April 2002, when he succeeded his father as Earl of Bessborough (I., 1739), Viscount Duncannon (I., 1723), Baron Bessborough (I., 1721), Baron Ponsonby of Sysonby (G.B., 1749), and Baron Duncannon of Bessborough (U.K., 1834).

In 2003 he was living at Stansted Park, Rowland&#x27;s Castle, Hampshire.

In 1972, he married Alison Marjorie Storey, daughter of William Henry Storey (1905–1975) and Marjorie Egerton Shakerley (1908–2001). They have three children:
*Frederick Arthur William Ponsonby, Viscount Duncannon (born 1974), heir apparent, whose heir is his son, the Hon. William August Longfield Ponsonby (born 2008) 
*Lady Chloë Patricia Ponsonby (born 1975)
*Hon. Henry Ponsonby (born 1977)

===Title succession chart===












===Relationship with other Ponsonby families===
The baronies Ponsonby of Shulbrede and de Mauley are in the remainder for the earldom of Bessborough. The present holders – Frederick Ponsonby, 4th Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede, and Rupert Ponsonby, 7th Baron de Mauley – are both fifth cousins of the 12th Earl of Bessborough (and of each other, both being descendants of younger sons of the 3rd Earl; see chart below).

It is however unlikely that either of them would inherit the earldom, as the 12th Earl has two sons and a grandson, as well as two younger halfbrothers, both of whom with male issue. There is also an unbroken line of male descendants from the fourth son of the 7th Earl.

<text>The Lancet is a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal and one of the oldest of its kind. It is also one of the world&#x27;s highest-impact academic journals. It was founded in England in 1823.

The journal publishes original research articles, review articles (&quot;seminars&quot; and &quot;reviews&quot;), editorials, book reviews, correspondence, as well as news features and case reports. &quot;The Lancet&quot; has been owned by Elsevier since 1991, and its editor-in-chief since 1995 has been Richard Horton. The journal has editorial offices in London, New York City, and Beijing.

==History==
&quot;The Lancet&quot; was founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakley, an English surgeon who named it after the surgical instrument called a lancet (scalpel). According to BBC, the journal was initially considered to be radical following its founding. 

Members of the Wakley family retained editorship of the journal until 1908. In 1921, &quot;The Lancet&quot; was acquired by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Elsevier acquired &quot;The Lancet&quot; from Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1991.

==Impact==
According to &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal had a 2023 impact factor of 98.4, ranking it first above &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in the category &quot;Medicine, General &amp; Internal&quot;. According to &quot;BMJ Open&quot; in 2017, &quot;The Lancet&quot; was more frequently cited in general newspapers around the world than &quot;The BMJ&quot;, &quot;NEJM and JAMA&quot;.

==Specialty journals==
&quot;The Lancet&quot; also publishes several specialty journals: &quot;The Lancet Neurology&quot; (neurology), &quot;The Lancet Oncology&quot; (oncology), &quot;The Lancet Infectious Diseases&quot; (infectious diseases), &quot;The Lancet Respiratory Medicine&quot; (respiratory medicine), &quot;The Lancet Psychiatry&quot; (psychiatry), &quot;The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology&quot; (endocrinology), and &quot;The Lancet Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology&quot; (gastroenterology) all of which publish original research and reviews. In 2013, &quot;The Lancet Global Health&quot; (global health) became the group&#x27;s first fully open access journal. In 2014, &quot;The Lancet Haematology&quot; (haematology) and &quot;The Lancet HIV&quot; (infectious diseases) were launched, both as online only research titles. &quot;The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health&quot; (paediatrics) launched in 2017. According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, &quot;The Lancet Oncology&quot; had a 2021 impact factor of 54.433, &quot;The Lancet Neurology&quot; had 59.935, and &quot;The Lancet Infectious Diseases&quot; had 71.421. There is also an online website for students entitled &quot;The Lancet Student&quot; in blog format, launched in 2007.

Since July 2018, &quot;The Lancet&quot; has also published two open access journals as part of &quot;The Lancet Discovery Science&quot;, dedicated to essential early evidence: &quot;eBioMedicine&quot; (translational research), a journal initially launched in 2014 by parent publisher Elsevier, since 2015 supported by Cell Press and &quot;The Lancet&quot;, and eventually (July 2018) incorporated in &quot;The Lancet family journals&quot; together with its newly incepted sister journal &quot;eClinicalMedicine&quot; (clinical research and public health research). In May 2019, The Lancet Digital Health published its first issue.

=== Specialty journal commissions ===
Occasionally, the editors of the specialty journals will feel name commissions about a certain particular issue of concern to a wide sub-audience of their readers. One example of this type of commission is the &quot;Lancet Infectious Diseases&quot; Commission on &quot;Preparedness for emerging epidemic threats&quot;, which reported on its mandate in January 2020.

==Volume renumbering==
Prior to 1990, &quot;The Lancet&quot; had volume numbering that reset every year. Issues in January to June were in volume &quot;i&quot;, with the rest in volume &quot;ii&quot;. In 1990, the journal moved to a sequential volume numbering scheme, with two volumes per year. Volumes were retro-actively assigned to the years prior to 1990, with the first issue of 1990 being assigned volume 335, and the last issue of 1989 assigned volume 334. The table of contents listing on ScienceDirect uses this newer numbering scheme.

==Editorial controversies==
&quot;The Lancet&quot; includes editorial content and letters in addition to scientific papers, which have at times been controversial. For example, it called for a ban on tobacco in the United Kingdom in 2003, expressed support for Gaza during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, and issued an apology for sexist language.

=== Tobacco ban proposal (2003) ===
A December 2003 editorial by the journal, titled &quot;How do you sleep at night, Mr Blair?&quot;, called for tobacco use to be completely banned in the United Kingdom. 

The Royal College of Physicians rejected their argument. John Britton, chairman of the college&#x27;s tobacco advisory group, praised the journal for discussing the health problem, but concluded that a &quot;ban on tobacco would be a nightmare.&quot; Amanda Sandford, spokesperson for the anti-tobacco group Action on Smoking and Health, stated that criminalising a behaviour 26% of the population commit &quot;is ludicrous.&quot; She also said: &quot;We can&#x27;t turn the clock back. If tobacco were banned we would have 13 million people desperately craving a drug that they would not be able to get.&quot; The deputy editor of &quot;The Lancet&quot; responded to the criticism by arguing that no other measures besides a total ban would likely be able to reduce tobacco use.

The smokers&#x27; rights group FOREST stated that the editorial gave them &quot;amusement and disbelief&quot;. Director Simon Clark called the journal &quot;fascist,&quot; and argued that it is hypocritical to ban tobacco while allowing unhealthy junk foods, alcohol consumption, and participation in extreme sports. Health Secretary John Reid reiterated that his government was committed to helping people give up smoking. He added: &quot;Despite the fact that this is a serious problem, it is a little bit extreme for us in Britain to start locking people up because they have an ounce of tobacco somewhere.&quot;

=== Open letter for the people of Gaza (2014)===
In August 2014 and during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published an &quot;Open letter for the people of Gaza&quot; in their correspondence section. As reported in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the letter &quot;condemned Israel in the strongest possible terms, but strikingly made no mention of Hamas&#x27; atrocities.&quot; According to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, the authors of the letter include doctors who &quot;are apparently sympathetic to the views of David Duke, a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard.&quot; One of the doctors responded by saying that the letter was a legitimate exercise in freedom of expression, while a second one stated that he had no knowledge about David Duke or the Ku Klux Klan.

The editor of &quot;The Lancet&quot;, Richard Horton, said: &quot;I have no plans to retract the letter, and I would not retract the letter even if it was found to be substantiated.&quot; However, Horton subsequently came to Israel&#x27;s Rambam Hospital for a visit and said that he &quot;deeply, deeply regret[ted] the completely unnecessary polarization that publication of the letter by Dr Paola Manduca caused.&quot;

Mark Pepys, a member of the Jewish Medical Association, criticised the letter as being a &quot;partisan political diatribe&quot; which was inappropriate for a serious publication. In addition, Pepys accused Richard Horton personally for allowing the publication of such political views.

=== February 2020 letter dismissing Covid lab-leak theory ===
On 19 February 2020, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a letter signed by 27 scientists that stated: &quot;We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin ... [Scientists] overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,&quot; adding: &quot;Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.&quot; The letter has been criticized for having a chilling effect on scientific research and the scientific community, by implying that scientists who &quot;bring up the lab-leak theory... are doing the work of conspiracy theorists&quot;; the statement was deemed to have &quot;effectively ended the debate over COVID-19&#x27;s origins before it began&quot;. Further criticism of the letter was focused on the fact that, according to emails obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, members involved in producing the letter concealed their involvement &quot;to creat[e] the impression of scientific unanimity&quot; and failed to disclose conflicts of interest.

After having published letters supporting only the natural origins theory, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a letter in September 2021 from a group of 16 virologists, biologists, and biosecurity specialists saying that &quot;Research-related hypotheses are not misinformation or conjecture&quot; and that &quot;Scientific journals should open their columns to in-depth analyses of all hypotheses.&quot; &quot;The Times of India&quot; described &quot;The Lancet&quot;&#x27;s decision to publish the letter as a &quot;u-turn&quot;.

In June 2024, &quot;The Lancet&quot; wrote an op-ed stating that &quot;SARS-CoV-2 is a natural virus that found its way into humans through mundane contact with infected wildlife&quot; and that &quot;doubling down on flawed assumptions in the face of growing evidence calls motivations into question.&quot;

=== &quot;Bodies with vaginas&quot; controversy ===
The 25 September 2021 edition of &quot;The Lancet&quot; included a review of an exhibition about the history of menstruation at the Vagina Museum. The journal&#x27;s cover displayed a quotation from the review that referred to women as &quot;bodies with vaginas&quot;. The quotation drew strong criticism on Twitter accusing &quot;The Lancet&quot; of sexism, arguing that this language was &quot;dehumanising&quot; and an &quot;unhelpful&quot; attempt at inclusivity. Horton later issued an apology on the journal&#x27;s website.

=== Gaza death count report (2024) ===
On 5 July 2024, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published in its Correspondence section a letter with an estimate of the number of direct and indirect deaths that may be caused in the coming months and years by the Gaza war. Using other conflicts, where the number of indirect deaths was 3 to 15 times higher than the number of direct deaths, the authors estimated the total number of conflict-related deaths by multiplying the reported deaths by five, and argued that in the coming months and years &quot;it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza&quot;.

The estimate quickly gained traction in both international and regional media, with some of the outlets misrepresenting the 186,000 figure as the actual number of deaths, rather than long-term cumulative estimate. As a result, three days after the publication, one of the letter&#x27;s authors, Martin McKee, wrote that the letter “has been greatly misquoted and misinterpreted” and clarified that the 186,000 figure was “purely illustrative”.

The letter has been criticized by the Chair of &quot;Every Casualty Counts&quot; network Michael Spagat, who wrote that the estimate &quot;lacks a solid foundation and is implausible&quot;. Peter A. Singer, former Special Adviser to the Director-General of WHO, characterized the letter&#x27;s methods as &quot;take one unreliable number and multiply by another unreliable number to get a bigger unreliable number”.

Consequently, American Jewish Committee called upon &quot;The Lancet&quot; to &quot;remove the letter from its website and, moving forward, exercise greater caution in selecting the claims it amplifies&quot;.

==Scientific controversies==
=== Andrew Wakefield and the MMR vaccine (1998) ===

&quot;The Lancet&quot; was criticised after it published a paper in 1998 in which the authors suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorder. In February 2004, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a statement by 10 of the paper&#x27;s 13 coauthors repudiating the possibility that MMR could cause autism. The editor-in-chief, Richard Horton, went on the record to say the paper had &quot;fatal conflicts of interest&quot; because the study&#x27;s lead author, Andrew Wakefield, had a serious conflict of interest that he had not declared to &quot;The Lancet&quot;. The journal completely retracted the paper on 2 February 2010, after Wakefield was found to have acted unethically in conducting the research.

&quot;The Lancet&quot;″s six editors, including the editor-in-chief, were also criticised in 2011 because they had &quot;covered up&quot; the &quot;Wakefield concocted fear of MMR&quot; with an &quot;avalanche of denials&quot; in 2004.

=== Iraq War death toll estimates (2004–2006) ===
&quot;The Lancet&quot; also published an estimate of the Iraq War&#x27;s Iraqi death toll—around 100,000—in 2004. In 2006, a follow-up study by the same team suggested that the violent death rate in Iraq was not only consistent with the earlier estimate, but had increased considerably in the intervening period (see &quot;Lancet&quot; surveys of casualties of the Iraq War). The second survey estimated that there had been 654,965 excess Iraqi deaths as a consequence of the war. The 95% confidence interval was 392,979 to 942,636. 1,849 households that contained 12,801 people were surveyed.

=== PACE study (2011) ===
In 2011, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a study by the UK-based &quot;PACE trial management group&quot;, which reported success with graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy for ME/CFS; a follow-up study was published in &quot;Lancet Psychiatry&quot; in 2015. The studies attracted criticism from some patients and researchers, especially with regard to data analysis that was different from that described in the original protocol. In a 2015 &quot;Slate&quot; article, biostatistician Bruce Levin of Columbia University was quoted saying &quot;The Lancet needs to stop circling the wagons and be open&quot;, and that &quot;one of the tenets of good science is transparency&quot;; while Ronald Davis of Stanford University said: &quot;the Lancet should step up to the plate and pull that paper&quot;. Horton defended &quot;The Lancet&quot;&#x27;s publication of the trial and called the critics: &quot;a fairly small, but highly organized, very vocal and very damaging group of individuals who have, I would say, actually hijacked this agenda and distorted the debate so that it actually harms the overwhelming majority of patients.&quot;

Starting in 2011, critics of the studies filed Freedom of Information Act requests to get access to the authors&#x27; primary data, in order to learn what the trial&#x27;s results would have been under the original protocol. In 2016, some of the data was released, which allowed calculation of results based on the original protocol and found that additional treatment led to no significant improvement in recovery rates over the control group.

The results from the PACE trial have been used to promote graded exercise therapy; however, these recommendations are now viewed by most public health bodies as outdated and highly harmful to ME/CFS patients.

=== Metastudy on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (2020) ===
In May 2020, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a metastudy by Mandeep R. Mehra of the Harvard Medical School and Sapan S. Desai of Surgisphere Corporation, which concluded that the malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine did not improve the condition of COVID-19 patients, and may have harmed some of them.

In response to concerns raised by members of the scientific community and the media about the veracity of the data and analyses, &quot;The Lancet&quot; decided to launch an independent third party investigation of Surgisphere and the metastudy. Specifically, &quot;The Lancet&quot; editors wanted to &quot;evaluate the origination of the database elements, to confirm the completeness of the database, and to replicate the analyses presented in the paper.&quot; The independent peer reviewers in charge of the investigation notified &quot;The Lancet&quot; that Surgisphere would not provide the requested data and documentation. The authors of the metastudy then asked &quot;The Lancet&quot; to retract the article, which was done on June 3, 2020.

As a step to increase quality control, the editors of The Lancet Group announced changes to the editorial policy in a comment titled &quot;Learning from a retraction&quot; which was published on September 22, 2020.

=== Covid Commission head pushed US lab origin conspiracy theory (2022) ===
In September 2022, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published the report of their &quot;Covid-19 Commission&quot; which was headed by Jeffrey Sachs, an economist with no medical background, who has pushed the conspiracy theory that Covid came from a US &quot;biotechnology&quot; lab.

Before the report&#x27;s release, Sachs appeared on the podcast of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has previously spread vaccine conspiracy theories. On the podcast episode, Sachs claimed that &quot;Government officials such as Anthony Fauci &quot;are not being honest&quot; about the virus&#x27;s origins&quot;. The published report included claims that &quot;&#x27;independent researchers have not yet investigated&#x27; US labs, and said the National Institutes of Health has &#x27;resisted disclosing details&#x27; of its work.&quot;

Virologist Angela Rasmussen commented that this may have been &quot;one of The Lancet&#x27;s most shameful moments regarding its role as a steward and leader in communicating crucial findings about science and medicine&quot;.
David Robertson from the University of Glasgow&#x27;s Centre for Virus Research said that &quot;It&#x27;s really disappointing to see such a potentially influential report contributing to further misinformation on such an important topic&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s true we&#x27;ve details to understand on the side of natural origins, for example the exact intermediate species involved, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s… any basis to the wild speculation that US labs were involved&quot;.

=== Tissue-engineered trachea transplant (2023) ===
In October 2023, The Lancet retracted two papers from 2008 and 2014 by surgeon Paolo Macchiarini. These papers, which discussed the first tissue-engineered trachea transplant, were found to contain fabricated information following an investigation by the Swedish National Board for Assessment of Research Misconduct. 

Before the 2023 retractions, in September 2015, The Lancet published an editorial titled, &quot;Paolo Macchiarini is not guilty of scientific misconduct.&quot;

<doc id="463902" wikidata="Q772987" url="?curid=463902" title="Earl Belmore">
<text>Earl Belmore is a title in the Peerage of Ireland that was created in 1797 for Armar Lowry-Corry, 1st Viscount Belmore, who had previously represented County Tyrone in the Irish House of Commons. He had already been created Baron Belmore, of Castle Coole in County Fermanagh (now in Northern Ireland), in 1781 and Viscount Belmore in 1789, also in the Peerage of Ireland. Born Armar Lowry, he was the son of Galbraith Lowry, Member of the Irish House of Commons for County Tyrone, and his wife Sarah, daughter of Colonel John Corry. In 1774, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Corry. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented County Tyrone in both the Irish and British House of Commons, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1819 to 1841, and served as Governor of Jamaica from 1828 to 1832.

His eldest son, the third Earl, represented County Fermanagh at Westminster. On his early death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer between 1857 and 1913, and he served under the Earl of Derby as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department between 1866 and 1867. From 1867 to 1872, Lord Belmore was Governor of New South Wales. The line of the fourth Earl failed on the death of his younger son, the sixth Earl, in 1949, and he was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the seventh Earl. He was the son of Major Adrian Lowry-Corry, fifth son of Admiral the Hon. Armar Lowry-Corry, himself the second son of the third Earl. , the titles are held by his son, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 1960.

Several other members of the Lowry-Corry family have also gained distinction. The Conservative politician the Honourable Henry Lowry-Corry, First Lord of the Admiralty from 1866 to 1867, was the second son of the second Earl. His younger son was Montagu Corry, 1st Baron Rowton, private secretary to Benjamin Disraeli. The Honourable Armar Lowry-Corry (1836–1919), second son of the third Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The Honourable Henry Lowry-Corry, younger son of the third Earl, was also a politician.

The invented title of &quot;Viscount Corry&quot; is used as a courtesy title for the Earl&#x27;s heir apparent. The family seat is Castle Coole, near Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.

<doc id="463907" wikidata="Q5539510" url="?curid=463907" title="George F. Hoar">
<text>George Frisbie Hoar (August 29, 1826 – September 30, 1904) was an American attorney and politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate from 1877 until his death in 1904. He belonged to an extended family that became politically prominent in 18th- and 19th-century New England.

An abolitionist and Radical Republican, Hoar recognized the immorality of slavery and was raised in a household which actively opposed racial bigotry and often defied laws they deemed unjust. Hoar strongly opposed and assailed the Democratic Party, which he viewed as the party of the saloon keeper, ballot box stuffer, and Klansman.

Hoar was referred to by his middle name &quot;Frisbie&quot; among friends.

==Early life==
Hoar was born in Concord, Massachusetts, on August 29, 1826. He studied for several months at a boarding school in Waltham, Massachusetts, run by Samuel and Sarah Bradford Ripley. He graduated from Harvard University in 1846 and earned his law degree at Harvard Law School in 1849. He was admitted to the bar and settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he practiced law. Initially a member of the Free Soil Party, of which he became the leader, he joined the Republican Party shortly after its founding.

==Political career==
Hoar was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1852 and to the Massachusetts Senate in 1857.
He represented Massachusetts as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for four terms from 1869 to 1877 and then served in the U.S. Senate until his death during his fifth term. For one term during his House service, from 1873 to 1875, his brother Ebenezer Rockood Hoar served alongside him. He was a Republican, but generally avoided heavy partisanship, and did not hesitate to criticize other members of the party whose actions or policies he believed were in error.

Between 1856 and 1857 Hoar was active as a Kansas Free-Stater, supported the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, and took a leading part in reconstruction legislation. He took part in the investigation of the Crédit Mobilier scandal and the impeachment of William W. Belknap, President Grant&#x27;s secretary of war.

In 1880 Hoar was chairman of the 1880 Republican National Convention. When James Garfield, who eventually won the party&#x27;s nomination and the presidential election, rose to object that votes were being cast for him without his consent, Hoar disallowed his objection. He later said: &quot;I was terribly afraid that he would say something that would make his nomination impossible.&quot;

An economic nationalist, Hoar believed in capitalism as progress for civilization in accordance to the plans by God. He supported measures which aimed at protecting American industries from foreign competition.

In Congress, Hoar established a reputation as a conservative on economic issues. He opposed monetary inflation, post-war greenbacks without the backing of gold, and free coinage of silver. In addition to viewing silver as an &quot;inferior metal,&quot; Hoar favored protectionist tariffs, a common position within the Republican Party. He served as a member, and at times chairman, of the important Senate Judiciary Committee.

In 1874, a dying Charles Sumner lay on his deathbed, and among his last visitors were Rep. Hoar. Sumner told the representative to ensure passage of what became known as the Civil Rights Act of 1875:
Indeed, Hoar successfully fought in ensuring the bill&#x27;s passage, although it became law in a weakened form.

Hoar was long noted as a fighter against political corruption. He campaigned for the rights of African Americans and Native Americans, which included the reusing of tribal lands for individual settlement of Native Americans. He was a strong advocate of the Dawes Act and allotment schemes which allocated communal tribal lands to individuals. He explained these views by comparing federal Indian relations to that of &quot;a father to his son, or by a guardian to an insane ward...&quot; - out of context. He opposed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, describing it as &quot;nothing less than the legalization of racial discrimination&quot; He was a member of the Congressional Electoral Commission that settled the highly disputed 1876 U.S. presidential election. He authored the Presidential Succession Act of 1886.

During the 1884 United States presidential election, Hoar expressed sharp anger at Mugwumps, Republicans who supported Bourbon Democrat Grover Cleveland over GOP nominee James G. Blaine; he asserted to a friend who supported Cleveland:
Hoar argued in the Senate in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage as early as 1886. He was one of only seven senators, and one of only two Republican senators (along with Henry W. Blair of New Hampshire), to vote against the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887, which abolished women&#x27;s suffrage in Utah after it had been a territorial right since 1870 (among other stipulations which were mainly aimed at eliminating Mormon polygamy and curbing the institutional power of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints there).

Hoar was a consistent opponent of American imperialism. He did not share his Senate colleagues&#x27; enthusiasm for American intervention in Cuba in the late 1890s. In December 1897, he met with Native Hawaiian leaders opposed to the annexation of their nation. He then presented the Kūʻē Petitions to Congress and helped to defeat President William McKinley&#x27;s attempt to annex the Republic of Hawaii by treaty, though the islands were eventually annexed by means of joint resolution, called the Newlands Resolution.

After the Spanish–American War, Hoar became one of the Senate&#x27;s most outspoken opponents of the imperialism of the McKinley administration. He denounced the Philippine–American War and called for independence for the Philippines in a three-hour speech in the Senate, saying:

By this time, one of his strongest opponents on the pro-imperialist side was his fellow Massachusetts senator Henry Cabot Lodge, who was a leading advocate for the Treaty of Paris.

Hoar pushed for and served on the Lodge Committee, investigating allegations, later confirmed, of United States war crimes in the Philippine–American War. He also denounced the U.S. intervention in Panama.

Hoar voted against the Chinese Exclusion Act.

==Other interests==
In 1865, Hoar was one of the founders of the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science, now the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Hoar was active in the American Historical Association and the American Antiquarian Society, serving terms as president of both organizations. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1853, and served as vice-president from 1878 to 1884, and then served as president from 1884 to 1887. In 1887 he was among the founders of the American Irish Historical Society. He was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution in 1880, an overseer of Harvard University from 1896, and a trustee of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Through his efforts, the lost manuscript of William Bradford&#x27;s &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot; (1620–1647), an important founding document of the United States, was returned to Massachusetts, after being discovered in Fulham Palace, London, in 1855.

Hoar was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1901. His autobiography, &quot;Autobiography of Seventy Years&quot;, was published in 1903. It appeared first in serial form in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; magazine.

In 1904, he was one of several high-profile investors who backed the Intercontinental Correspondence University, but the institution folded by 1915. He attended the Unitarian Church of All Souls in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="463911" wikidata="Q1018311" url="?curid=463911" title="Buy American Act">
<text>The Buy American Act (originally , now ) passed in 1933 by the Congress and signed by President Hoover on his last full day in office (March 3, 1933), required the United States government to prefer U.S.-made products in its purchases. Other pieces of federal legislation extend similar requirements to third-party purchases that utilize federal funds, such as highway and transit programs. In July 2024, the Congress passed the All-American Flag Act requiring U.S. government to buy only U.S.-made American flags, 41 U.S.C. § 6310. 

The Buy American Act is not to be confused with the very similarly named &quot;Buy America Act&quot; that came into effect 50 years later. The latter, a provision of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, is 49 U.S.C., § 5323 (j), and applies only to mass-transit-related procurements valued over US$100,000 and funded at least in part by federal grants.

In certain government procurements, the requirement purchase may be waived by the Contracting Officer or the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) if the domestic product is 25% or more expensive than an identical foreign-sourced product, if the product is not available domestically in sufficient quantity or quality, or if doing so is in the public&#x27;s interest.

The President has the authority to waive the Buy American Act within the terms of a reciprocal agreement or otherwise in response to the provision of reciprocal treatment to U.S. producers. Under the 1979 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Government Procurement Code, the U.S.–Israel Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.–Canada Free Trade Agreement, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) 1996 Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the United States provides access to the government procurement of certain U.S. agencies for goods from the other parties to those agreements. However, the Buy American Act was excluded from the GPA&#x27;s coverage.

<text>Ilex opaca, the American holly, is a species of holly, native to the eastern and south-central United States, from coastal Massachusetts south to central Florida, and west to southeastern Missouri and eastern Texas.

==Description==
&quot;Ilex opaca&quot; is a medium-sized broadleaved evergreen tree growing on average to wide, and up to tall. Typically, its trunk diameter reaches , sometimes up to . The bark is light gray, roughened by small warty lumps. The branchlets are stout, green at first and covered with rusty down, later smooth and brown. The winter buds are brown, short, obtuse or acute. The branches are short and slender. The roots are thick and fleshy.

The leaves are alternate, long and wide, stiff, yellow green and dull matte to sub-shiny above (distinctly less glossy than the otherwise fairly similar European holly, &quot;Ilex aquifolium)&quot;, often pale yellow beneath; the edges are curved into several sharp, spike-like points, and a wedge-shaped base and acute apex; the midrib is prominent and depressed, the primary veins conspicuous; the petiole is short, stout, grooved, thickened at base, with a pair of minute stipules. The leaves remain on the branches for two to three years, finally falling in the spring when pushed off by growing buds.
The flowers are greenish white, small, borne in late spring in short pedunculate cymes from the axils of young leaves or scattered along the base of young branches. The calyx is small, four-lobed, imbricate in the bud, acute, margins ciliate, persistent. The corolla is white, with four petal-like lobes united at the base, obtuse, spreading, hypogynous, imbricate in bud. The flower stem is hairy with a minute bract at base. Like all hollies, it is dioecious, with separate male and female plants; only female plants produce the characteristic red berries. This fruit (drupes) appear late in the season, and whether due to the need to ripen or being a food of last resort, often last until midwinter. They are poisonous to dogs, cats, and humans, often causing diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and drowsiness if ingested. Cedar waxwings (&quot;Bombycilla cedrorum&quot;) will strip the trees of fruit if they are not already bare during their northward migration. One male can pollenize several females. Male flowers have four stamens, inserted on the base of the corolla, alternate with its lobes; filaments awl-shaped, exserted in the sterile, much shorter in the sterile flower; anthers attached at the back, oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally. The pistil on female flowers has a superior ovary, four-celled, rudimentary in staminate flowers; style wanting, stigma sessile, four-lobed; ovules one or two in each cell.

The fruit is a small red drupe 6–12 mm diameter containing four seeds; it is often persistent into winter.
A ratio of three female plants to one male plant is required for ideal fruit production.

The current world record American Holly tree is located in Rose Bud, White County, Arkansas. According to the National Forests Champion Trees Official Register, it boasts a trunk circumference of 182 inches, a height of 64 feet, and a crown spread of 63 feet.

== Taxonomy ==
It has four recognized subspecies/variations:
*&quot;Ilex opaca&quot; subsp. &quot;arenicola&quot; 
*&quot;Ilex opaca&quot; var. &quot;laxiflora&quot; 
*&quot;Ilex opaca&quot; subsp. &quot;opaca&quot;
*&quot;Ilex opaca&quot; var. &quot;opaca&quot;

==Ecology==
Due to its shade tolerance, &quot;Ilex opaca&quot; typically grows as an understory tree in moist forests of the east-central, southeastern, and south-central United States. It is found in sparse numbers in the northern part of its range from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, south to northern New Jersey (including southern Connecticut and southeastern New York, on Long Island). It is abundant further south on the Gulf and Atlantic lowlands. It will grow in both dry and swampy soil, but grows slowly. &quot;Ilex opaca&quot; var. &quot;arenicola&quot;, or scrub holly, is found as a shrub component in xeric scrub habitats of the Florida peninsula. The ideal yearly precipitation average for the species ranges from 102 cm to 165 cm.

The flowers are pollinated by insects, including bees, wasps, ants, and night-flying moths. It is a larval host plant for &quot;Callophrys henrici&quot;. The tree also forms a thick canopy which offers protection for birds from predators and storms. Songbirds including thrushes, mockingbirds, catbirds, bluebirds and thrashers, as well as some gamebirds and mammals frequently feed on the berries.

==Cultivation and uses==
The wood is very pale, tough, close-grained, takes a good polish, and is used for whip-handles, engraving blocks and also cabinet work. It can also be dyed and used as a substitute for ebony. It has a density of 0.58 to 0.64. The sap is watery, and contains a bitter substance used as an herbal tonic.

Leaves from the American holly can be used to make a tea-like beverage. American holly tea does not contain caffeine.

===Ornamental plant===
&quot;Ilex opaca&quot; is often cultivated by plant nurseries for use as a broadleaf evergreen ornamental plant, planted as a shrub or slower growing ornamental tree. Over 1,000 cultivars have been selected, including plants selected for cold tolerance (&#x27;Cobalt&#x27;, a male cultivar, is able to tolerate temperatures as low as −32 °C), growth form (e.g. dwarf forms such as &#x27;Cardinal Hedge&#x27;, a female plant growing to 1.2 m tall), and color and abundance of fruit (notable female cultivars including the large-berried &#x27;Yule&#x27;, and the yellow-berried &#x27;Canary&#x27; and &#x27;Morgan Gold&#x27;). With &quot;Ilex cassine&quot; it is a parent of the hybrid &quot;Ilex × attenuata&quot;, which has ornamental cultivars.

===The holly in winter===

Holly is a popular winter Christmas and holiday season decoration. To Christians, the thorny foliage is attributed to the crown of thorns Christ wore, the berries represent his drops of blood, and the evergreen represents life after death. In English poetry and English stories the holly is inseparably connected with the merry-making and greetings which gather around the Christmas time. The custom is followed in North America, and holly and mistletoe are widely used for decoration of homes and churches.

The European holly is smaller than the American holly, but is closely related and closely resembles it. The leaves of both species are similar in outline and toothed and bristled very much the same way, but the leaves are brighter in the American holly and larger. The American holly, called the evergreen or Christmas holly (&quot;Ilex opaca&quot; ) was named the state tree of Delaware on 1 May 1939.

<doc id="463919" wikidata="Q2702" url="?curid=463919" title="Vladimir Oblast">
<text>Vladimir Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Vladimir, which is located east of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, the oblast&#x27;s population was 1,443,693.

The UNESCO World Heritage List includes the 12th-century cathedrals of Vladimir, Suzdal, Bogolyubovo, and Kideksha.

==Geography==
Vladimir Oblast borders Moscow, Yaroslavl, Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Nizhny Novgorod Oblasts. The oblast is situated in the center of the East European Plain. The Klyazma and the Oka are the most important rivers. There are approximately three hundred lakes. The oblast is situated in a zone of mixed forests. The region&#x27;s geology is characterized by a variety of sedimentary and igneous rocks, including sandstone, shale, limestone, granite, and diabase. There are also several mineral deposits in the oblast, including iron ore, apatite, and phosphate. Some notable natural landmarks in the oblast include the Klyazma Reservoir and the Suzdal Kremlin, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Additionally, there are several nature reserves and parks in the oblast, such as the Meshchyora National Park and the Ugra National Park.

===Fauna===
The oblast&#x27;s fauna currently includes more than fifty species of mammals (some examples including elk, wild boar, roe deer, red and sika deer, lynx, wolf, squirrel, rabbit, marten, fox, weasel, badger and other fur-bearing animals), five species of reptiles, and ten species of amphibians. The semiaquatic Russian desman is listed in the Russian Red Book of endangered species. The region is inhabited by 216 species of birds, among which are the capercaillie, black grouse, grouse, partridge, woodcock, goose, duck, etc. The lesser white-fronted goose is listed in the Red Book.

Hunting season runs from October to February with the following license and permit restrictions:
*Elk, wild boar, red deer, and sika deer from mid-November through mid-January
*Hare from October through January
*Grouse, black grouse, woodcock, duck and goose for 10 days in April.

Bodies of water in the region are rich in numerous species (about 40) of fresh-water fish (e.g. eel, roach, pike, perch, bream, rudd, and sturgeon in the Klyazma River), which support ice fishing in winter. Additionally, the oblast has several hunting farms.

===Hydrography===
The total expanse of the oblast&#x27;s surface waters is 32.9 hectares.

The region has hundreds of rivers with a total length of more than 8.6 million kilometers—there are 560 rivers and streams throughout the oblast. The Klyazma River flows into the Oka River on the south-eastern edge of the oblast&#x27;s border with the Nizhny Novgorod Region. The Klyazma River&#x27;s major tributaries in the Vladimir Region are the Sherna (with the Molokcha flowing into it), the Kirzhach (with its own tributaries being the Big and Small Kirzhach), the Peksha, the Koloksha, the Nerl, the Sudogda, the Uvod, the Lukh and the Suvorosch. Tributaries of the Oka within Vladimir oblast are the Gus, Unzha, and Ushna rivers. The Dubna River, a tributary of the Volga River, originates near the town of Alexandrov. The Oka River is navigable throughout the region (157 km). The rivers in the region are characterized by their flat currents, broad valleys and meandering channels. Water levels are characterized by their high spring tides, low water periods over summer-autumn with occasional flooding during heavy rains, and stable/low levels throughout the winter.

There are about three hundred lakes covering an area of five thousand hectares. Most of them are small and undrained and many are overgrown with a peat layer. The origin of the lakes varies. Numerous oxbow lakes are scattered along the river valleys. The largest of them are Lake Urvanovskoe (12 km long) and Lake Visha (length about 10 km). In the Meshchera Lowlands and in the northwest of the oblast are lakes of ancient alluvial valleys: Isikhry, Svyatoe and others. Lakes of karst origin, located in the lower reaches of the Klyazma and in the center of Vyaznikovsky District (a northeastern district in the oblast), have highly mineralized water and are associated with underground watercourses. The largest and deepest of them is Lake Kshchara. In the districts of Alexandrov and Yuryev-Polsky glacial lakes are small in size.

The main masses of wetlands in the region (total area of 37.4 thousand hectares) occur in Meshchera and Balakhna (in the northeast of the oblast) lowlands.

=== Climate ===
Vladimir Oblast has a humid continental climate. The region experiences a significant temperature range between day and night during the summer months, which can lead to frequent thunderstorms.

The oblast receives an average of 600-700 millimeters of precipitation annually, with most of it falling in the summer months. Snowfall is common in the winter months, with an average of 50-60 centimeters (20-24 inches) of snowfall per year.

The climate of Vladimir Oblast is influenced by its location in the center of the East European Plain and its distance from the ocean. The oblast is situated far from any major bodies of water, which means that it experiences a greater temperature range and less moderating effects from maritime air masses than regions closer to the coast. However, the region is also shielded from harsh arctic air masses by the Ural Mountains, which lie to the east.

==History==
The territory of modern Vladimir Oblast has been populated since ancient times. The oldest known traces of human settlement date to the Upper Paleolithic. A settlement of Homo Sapiens dating back to between 32,050 BC and 28,550 BC was discovered in the area of Sungir, located around 200 km east of Moscow.

The region of Vladimir were inhabited by different people like Slavs, Tatars, Finno-Ugrics and Balts. The East Slavic tribe of the Buzhans originated in the Vladimir region. Archaeological excavations of Volga Finn settlements document also the Finno-Ugric roots of this land. Merya, Muromian, and Meshchera are inhabited territory of the region during this period.

Since the 10th century AD, Slavic colonization of the area began in Murom and Suzdal. The current territory of Vladimir Oblast became was part of Kievan Rus. After the breakdown of the authority of Kievan Rus, the region became part of the Rostov-Suzdal principality in the 11th century and then the Vladimir-Suzdal principality in the 12th century. The Vladimir region rapidly developed in the mid-12th century during the rule of Yuri Dolgorukiy and Andrey Bogolyubsky. New townships arose—Yuriev-Polsky, Yaropolch-Zalessky, Gorokhovets, Starodub-on-the-Klyazma, Mstislavl—along with princely residences in Kideksha and Bogolyubovo.

The Vladimir Highway, a pre-modern civilian road that has been in use since at least the 14th century, traverses the region, bringing people between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod.

Most, if not all, of modern Vladimir, during the Soviet period, seems to have been part of Ivanovo Oblast until it became a separate Federal Subject in 1944.

==Politics==

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Vladimir CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Vladimir Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The current Charter was accepted by the Legislative Assembly of Vladimir Oblast on 14 August 2001.

===Legislative branch===

The Legislative Assembly of Vladimir Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it.

The current 6th convocation was elected in the elections on 8 September 2013 under a mixed system (19 deputies were elected in single-mandate constituencies, 19 on the lists of political parties). Most of the seats are held by United Russia - 32, the Communist Party - 3, the Liberal Democratic Party - 2, A Just Russia - 1. Vladimir Kiselyov (United Russia) was elected Chairman of the Legislative Assembly. On 17 August 2015, Deputy Sergei Kuryshyov (United Russia), who was sentenced to five and a half years in a colony-settlement for a fatal accident while drunk, was prematurely deprived of his mandate.

===Executive branch===
The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

The governor is elected by citizens of the Russian Federation residing in the territory of the Vladimir Oblast and possessing active suffrage based on universal, equal, and direct suffrage by secret ballot for a term of 5 years. Since October 2021, the position has been occupied by Aleksandr Avdeyev, having also won the 2022 Vladimir Oblast gubernatorial election.

===Judicial branch===
Judicial power is exercised by the federal courts, the Vladimir Oblast Court, the Arbitration Court of the Vladimir Oblast, and the Justices of the Peace of the Vladimir Oblast.

===Representatives in the Federal Assembly===
Like every federal subject, the Federation Council of the Vladimir Oblast has two representatives: one from the legislative assembly and one from the republic&#x27;s government.

In the 2021 elections to the State Duma of the 8th convocation (2021-2026), two deputies from the Vladimir Oblast were elected in two constituencies: in constituency No. 79 - Igor Igoshin, in constituency No. 80 - Grigory Anikeyev.

According to party lists of the single federal district (proportional system) in the regional group Vladimir Oblast, three candidates received mandates: Nikolai Burlyaev (A Just Russia), Aleksey Govyrin (United Russia), and Roman Lyabikhov (Communist Party).
