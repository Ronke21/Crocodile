<text>Gaius Albinovanus Pedo, sometimes mistakenly called C. Pedo Albinovanus, was a Roman poet who flourished during the Augustan age.

==Works==
Albinovanus Pedo was a member of the gens Albinovana. He wrote a &quot;Theseis&quot;, referred to in a letter from his friend Ovid, epigrams which are commended by Martial and an epic poem on the exploits of Germanicus. He had the reputation of being an excellent &quot;raconteur&quot;, and Quintilian awards him qualified praise as a writer of epics.

All that remains of his works is a fragment preserved in the &quot;Suasoria&quot; of the rhetorician Seneca the Elder, from a description of the voyage of Germanicus (AD 16) through the river Ems to the Northern Ocean, when he was overtaken by the storm described by Tacitus. The cavalry commander spoken of by the historian is probably identical with the poet.

Three elegies were formerly attributed to Pedo by Scaliger; two on the death of Maecenas (&quot;In Obitum Maecenatis&quot; and &quot;De Verbis Maecenatis moribundi&quot;), and a &quot;consolatio&quot; addressed to Livia to console her for the death of her son Drusus (&quot;Consolatio ad Liviam de Morte Drusi&quot; or &quot;Epicedion Drusi&quot;, usually printed with Ovid&#x27;s works); but it is now generally agreed that they are not by Pedo. The &quot;Consolatio&quot; has been put down as late as the 15th century as the work of an Italian imitator, there being no manuscripts and no trace of the poem before the publication of the &quot;editio princeps&quot; of Ovid in 1471. There is an English verse translation of the elegies by Edward Hayes Plumptre (1907).

<text>A staysail (&quot;stays&#x27;l&quot;) is a fore-and-aft rigged sail whose luff can be affixed to a stay running forward (and most often but not always downwards) from a mast to the deck, the bowsprit, or to another mast.

== Description ==

Most staysails are triangular; however, some are four-cornered, notably some fisherman&#x27;s staysails.

Triangular staysails set forward of the foremost mast are called jibs, headsails, or foresails. The innermost such sail on a cutter, schooner, and many other rigs having two or more foresails is referred to simply as &quot;the staysail&quot;, while the others are referred to as jibs, flying jibs, etc.

Types of staysail include the tallboy staysail (a narrow staysail carried between the spinnaker and the mainsail on racing yachts), the genoa staysail (a larger one carried inside the spinnaker when broad reaching), and the bigboy staysail (another name for the shooter or blooper, carried on the leeward side of the spinnaker). Unlike the cutter staysail, none of these sails have their luff affixed to a stay.

On large rigs, staysails other than headsails are named according to the mast and mast section on which they are hoisted. Thus, the staysail hoisted on a stay that runs forward and downwards from the top of the &quot;mizzen topgallant mast&quot; is the &quot;mizzen topgallant staysail&quot;. If two staysails are hoisted to different points on this mast, they would be the &quot;mizzen upper topgallant staysail&quot; and the &quot;mizzen lower topgallant staysail&quot;.

== Uses ==
In square rigged ships the staysails can help in tacking, overcoming the lumbering square sails&#x27; tendency to prevent bearing up to windward, especially in light winds. Where a ship attempts to tack but fails and has to bear away again on the original tack, she is said to have missed her stays. In cutter rigged yachts the genoa will often need to be furled before changing tack due to the difficulty in passing the big sail between the two forestays. Here the staysail can help bring the bow through the wind more effectively.

In addition to providing more overall sailing force, a staysail can be used to modify a ship&#x27;s sail plan to be more efficient in different types of weather. For example, in high winds a captain might reef a headsail, but that impacts the sail shape and can result in slower ship speed. Instead, the headsail could be furled entirely and a staysail used instead, resulting in higher ship speed.

<text>The New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary, also known as the Hudson-Raritan Estuary, is in the northeastern states of New Jersey and New York on the East Coast of the United States. The system of waterways of the Port of New York and New Jersey forms one of the most intricate natural harbors in the world and one of the busiest ports of the United States. The harbor opens onto the New York Bight in the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast and Long Island Sound to the northeast.

Although the overall form of the estuary remains unchanged from the time of Giovanni da Verrazzano&#x27;s visit in 1524, all parts have changed at least a little, and some parts, such as Hell Gate and Ellis Island, have been almost completely altered. In the greatest hidden change, the navigational channels have been deepened from the natural depth to . In some places this required blasting of bedrock.

There is an extremely complex system of tides and currents. Both the Bight and the Sound are essentially marine bodies with tides and saltwater, but the Sound compared to the Atlantic is about 20–30% less saline (as an estuary), and the tide is about 3 hours later with as much as 70% more variation. Rivers add a fresher, non-tidal inflow although the tide and brackishness extend well up rivers throughout the extended hydrologic system from Albany to Montauk Point to the Hudson Canyon region of the New York Bight. The New York Harbor Observing and Prediction System (NYHOPS) utilizes information from sensors, weather forecasts, and environment models to provide real-time forecasts of meteorological and oceanographic conditions in the area.

Since the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 beaches along the shores of the East Coast have been regularly replenished with sand pumped in from off-shore. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) coordinates the projects. 

In 2016, USACE and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey produced a comprehensive restoration plan for the New York Harbor region, with proposals to mitigate the effects of sea level rise through projects to restore natural areas. In September the USACE released the New York New Jersey Harbor and Tributaries Study (HATS).

<doc id="456360" wikidata="Q1173180" url="?curid=456360" title="Dave Douglas (trumpeter)">
<text>Dave Douglas (born March 24, 1963) is an American jazz trumpeter, composer, and educator. His career includes more than fifty recordings as a leader and more than 500 published compositions. His ensembles include the Dave Douglas Quintet; Sound Prints, a quintet co-led with saxophonist Joe Lovano; Uplift, a sextet with bassist Bill Laswell; Present Joys with pianist Uri Caine and Andrew Cyrille; High Risk, an electronic ensemble with Shigeto, Jonathan Aaron, and Ian Chang; and Engage, a sextet with Jeff Parker, Tomeka Reid, Anna Webber, Nick Dunston, and Kate Gentile.

He has won a Doris Duke Performing Artist Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, an Aaron Copland award, and received Grammy Award nominations. As a composer, Douglas has received commissions from the Trisha Brown Dance Company, Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, Norddeutscher Rundfunk, Essen Philharmonie, The Library of Congress, Stanford University and Monash Art Ensemble, which premiered his chamber orchestra piece &quot;Fabliaux&quot; in March 2014.

From 2002 to 2012, he served as artistic director of the Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music at the Banff Centre in Canada. He is a co-founder of the Festival of New Trumpet Music in New York with trumpeter Roy Campbell Jr. Since 2003, Douglas has served as director of the nonprofit festival. He is on the faculty at the Mannes School of Music and is a guest coach for the Juilliard Jazz Composer&#x27;s Ensemble. In 2016, he accepted a four-year appointment as the artistic director of the Bergamo Jazz Festival.

In 2005 Douglas founded Greenleaf Music, a record label for his albums, sheet music, podcasts, as well as the music of other modern jazz musicians. Greenleaf has produced over 70 albums.

==Early life==
Born in Montclair, New Jersey, Douglas grew up in the New York City area and attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a private high school in New Hampshire. He was introduced to jazz by his father, Damon Greenleaf Douglas Jr., and as a young teen was shown jazz theory and harmony by the pianist Tommy Gallant. Douglas began performing jazz during his junior year in high school while on an abroad program in Barcelona, Spain. After graduating from high school in 1981, he studied at the Berklee College of Music and New England Conservatory, both located in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Career==
===1980s===
In 1984, Douglas moved to New York to study at New York University, to study directly with Carmine Caruso, and he finished a degree in music. Early gigs included the experimental rock band Dr. Nerve, Jack McDuff, Vincent Herring as well as street bands around New York City. He played with a variety of ensembles and came to the attention of the jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader, Horace Silver, with whom he toured the US and Europe in 1987.

In the late 1980s, Douglas began playing with bands led by Don Byron, Tim Berne, Marty Ehrlich, Walter Thompson, and others in New York. He played in the composer collectives Mosaic Sextet and New and Used. He also toured with theater companies including the world-renowned Bread and Puppet Theater and the Swiss ensemble .

===1990s===
In March 1993, Douglas got the opportunity to record his first album as a leader, &quot;Parallel Worlds&quot; (Black Saint/Soul Note), which featured his String Group with Mark Feldman (violin), Erik Friedlander (cello), Mark Dresser (bass), Michael Sarin (drums). The album is a collection of original pieces, some using serial composition techniques, and arrangements of Webern, Ellington, Kurt Weill and Stravinsky.

This first recording was followed in quick succession by the debuts of two groups, the Tiny Bell Trio (Songlines) with Brad Shepik and Jim Black and The Dave Douglas Sextet, with Chris Speed, Josh Roseman, Uri Caine, James Genus and Joey Baron, which recorded an homage to Booker Little called &quot;In Our Lifetime&quot; (New World).

This began a period during which Douglas recorded widely as a side musician and as a member of many new jazz groups. Douglas also began touring extensively worldwide both as a leader and as a side musician.

In 1993, Douglas also began performing with John Zorn in his Masada quartet, with Greg Cohen and Joey Baron. The group, which still occasionally performs, deals with Jewish and diaspora culture and heritage through Zorn&#x27;s original compositions. As such, it is an amalgam of jazz, new music, klezmer, and purely improvised styles. The band became one of Zorn&#x27;s most long-standing and popular ensembles, and brought Douglas wider attention. 

Since the mid-1990s, Douglas has led a variety of groups simultaneously. In 1996, Douglas recorded &quot;Sanctuary&quot; with Cuong Vu, Anthony Coleman, Yuka Honda, Dougie Bowne, and other musicians of the New York downtown scene of the time. The group involved sampling and DJ improvisations in addition to jazz.

In 1997, Douglas started a quartet featuring trumpet, violin, accordion, and bass (with Guy Lucevsek, Mark Feldman, and Greg Cohen) which recorded &quot;Charms of the Night Sky&quot;, incorporating sounds of Eastern European and Argentinian folk musics as well as jazz influences on the music, which is generally mellow and relaxed. The album included a number of tracks with Douglas and accordionist Guy Klucevsek performing as a duo. A second album by the Charms of the Night Sky group, &quot;A Thousand Evenings&quot; was released in 2000.

Also in 1997, Douglas founded a jazz quartet with Chris Potter, James Genus, and Ben Perowsky. This group recorded two albums in this period, &quot;Magic Triangle&quot; and &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;. Both were originally released by Arabesque Recordings, and have subsequently been reissued on Douglas&#x27;s own imprint, Greenleaf Music. Greenleaf has also released sheet music containing all of the original compositions from these albums. This group further explored Douglas&#x27;s interest in writing harmony for cordless groups and lyrical, accessible new acoustic jazz sounds.

Towards the end of the 1990s, Douglas formed a Quintet with Uri Caine on fender rhodes, Chris Potter, James Genus and drummer Clarence Penn. The formation of this group coincided with Douglas signing a seven-record deal with major label RCA Victor.

Douglas also began to appear at the mainstream jazz clubs around New York such as Iridium, Village Vanguard and Jazz Standard. His international touring continued with multiway residencies of his original works at festivals in Belgium, Italy, Poland, Germany, France and Spain.

It was at the end of the 1990s that Douglas first visited the Banff Centre for the Arts as a visiting artist, at the invitation of pianist Kenny Werner. A few year later he would begin a ten-year stint as the Director of the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music.

===2000s===
In 2000, Douglas released &quot;Soul on Soul&quot;, a tribute to composer and pianist Mary Lou Williams, featuring original arrangements of her music for the sextet and new pieces inspired by her work. Douglas also released albums featuring Charms of the Night Sky and the Dave Douglas Quartet in the same year.

In the early years of the decade, Douglas worked often with the Trisha Brown Dance Company. &quot;El Trilogy&quot;, an extended musical work accompanying modern dance, was performed during 2000–2001.

&quot;Witness&quot;, a nine-part suite, was released in 2001. It features a band made up of trumpet, sax, two electric pianos, electronic percussion, bass, and drums. Douglas&#x27; music had always been informed by his political concerns, but this album was his most ambitious attempt to give them musical form, often by celebrating his political and cultural heroes through dedications and track titles. The album includes a 20-minute track entitled &quot;Mahfouz&quot;, in which gravel-voiced singer Tom Waits reads an excerpt from the works of Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz, as well as pieces dedicated to Edward Said and Taslima Nasrin.

More recently, Douglas founded the Dave Douglas New Quintet and Nomad. The Quintet is a trumpet and tenor sax-led group but with Fender Rhodes electric piano. Their first album, &quot;The Infinite&quot; (2001), featured Douglas originals and pieces by or inspired by musicians Rufus Wainwright, Björk and Thom Yorke. This was followed up by 2004&#x27;s &quot;Strange Liberation&quot; by the same group with guest Bill Frisell on guitar. Formed in 2003, Nomad is made up of trumpet, clarinet, cello, tuba, and drums. With this band, Douglas performed his suite &quot;Mountain Passages&quot;, commissioned for the Italian Sound of the Dolomites Festival, and released as the first album on Douglas&#x27; record label Greenleaf Music in 2005. The suite features a variety of different influences including Italian Ladino music, New Orleans jazz, and other musics, and is to be played from 9 to 12,000 feet above sea level.

Douglas also started a new band called Keystone, which performs works influenced by the silent film actor and director Roscoe &#x27;Fatty&#x27; Arbuckle. The project includes pieces to be performed with Arbuckle&#x27;s films. This ensemble is made up of trumpet, tenor sax, Wurlitzer (electric piano), turntables, electric bass, and drums. A CD of this music – accompanied by a DVD with two Arbuckle shorts – was released in 2005.

2006 saw Douglas release &quot;Meaning and Mystery&quot;, where he plays again with his quintet, now with Donny McCaslin in place of Chris Potter on saxophones. In December 2006, Greenleaf Music recorded all the quintet&#x27;s performances over a six-night engagement at New York&#x27;s Jazz Standard jazz club, called them &quot;Live at the Jazz Standard&quot;, and made the two-hour sets the band played each night available for download from the company&#x27;s website within 24 hours. The 44 compositions, almost all of them by Douglas alongside covers of Wainwright, Mary J. Blige and Björk, featured 14 tunes not previously recorded by the band. Those 14 new compositions were released on a 2-CD set, &quot;Live at the Jazz Standard&quot;, in 2007.

In late 2007, &quot;Moonshine&quot;, a further recording by Keystone, was released. This was based upon recordings made of a concert performance by the band at that year&#x27;s Bray Jazz Festival in Ireland. The Keystone band then led a 5-night run at Jazz Standard in April 2008. Greenleaf Music recorded and released all ten sets through their website as a download-only series, &quot;Keystone: Live at Jazz Standard (Complete Book)&quot;.

In 2009, Douglas released two albums: &quot;Spirit Moves&quot; by his Brass Ecstasy band which featured Vincent Chancey, Luis Bonilla, Marcus Rojas and Nasheet Waits; and his first album of big band compositions, &quot;A Single Sky&quot;, a collaboration with Jim McNeely and the Frankfurt Radio Bigband.

===2010s===
In tandem with the 100th anniversary of the first Frankenstein film, Douglas collaborated with experimental film-maker Bill Morrison and released the 3-CD set &quot;Spark of Being&quot;. Written for his Keystone ensemble, the set includes three related, yet subtly different, albums to accompany the Morrison film. The first edition, entitled &quot;Soundtrack&quot;, comprises long-form pieces edited to accompany the film in real time. The second edition, &quot;Expand&quot;, contains extended performances of the original themes from the soundtrack, arranged in a traditional jazz album format. &quot;Burst&quot;, the third edition, consists of additional variations and unused outtakes recorded at the initial session.

In 2011, Douglas released three albums within the span of five months through Greenleaf Music. The albums were released only in digital format and contained approximately 30 to 50 minutes of music per album, referencing album lengths of the LP era. Released under the unifying label of the Greenleaf Portable Series, or GPS, the albums showcased ensembles that Douglas may only &quot;rarely get to play with&quot; in some cases. The first album, &quot;Rare Metals&quot; featured Douglas&#x27; Brass Ecstasy ensemble. The second album, &quot;Orange Afternoons&quot; included Ravi Coltrane on tenor sax, Vijay Iyer on piano, Linda Oh on bass, Marcus Gilmore on drums. The third, &quot;Bad Mango&quot;, paired Douglas with the innovative quartet So Percussion.

After the bandleaders&#x27; intersecting tenures in the SFJAZZ Collective in 2008, Douglas joined with tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano to form the co-led quintet Sound Prints with drummer Joey Baron, bassist Linda Oh and pianist Lawrence Fields. Inspired by the music of tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter the group debuted at New York&#x27;s Village Vanguard in November 2012. In 2013 the Monterey Jazz Festival commissioned Wayne Shorter to write two pieces for the group. Sound Prints premiered &quot;Unknown” and “To Sail Beyond The Sunset” at the festival that year. The concert resulted in &quot;Live at Monterey Jazz Festival&quot; on Blue Note Records in 2015. The group&#x27;s second album &quot;Scandal&quot;, was released in 2018 on Greenleaf Music and it marked the first time the pair has recorded a full studio album of material together. The album boasts ten originals by Lovano and Douglas as well as treatments of two Shorter classics. Two tracks from the same recording session were released on a 7” 45 on green vinyl: On Pebble Street was a special release for Record Store Day in April 2018. The quintet released their third album of original compositions, &quot;Other Worlds&quot;, in May 2021. The CD artwork features space-inspired artwork by celebrated visual artist Dave Chisholm. &quot;Other Worlds&quot; was later released as a double vinyl LP for Record Store Day Black Friday on November 25, 2022.

Douglas released &quot;Be Still&quot; in 2012. The album featured Douglas&#x27; newly formed quintet of Jon Irabagon on saxophone, Matt Mitchell on piano, Linda Oh on bass, and Rudy Royston on drums with the addition of vocalist Aoife O&#x27;Donovan. Dedicated to the memory of Douglas&#x27; mother, Emily, who died in 2011, &quot;Be Still&quot; features nine tracks, of which six are hymns and folks songs that she requested Douglas perform at her funeral. The same ensemble, minus O&#x27;Donovan, recorded and released &quot;Time Travel&quot; the following year.

Inspired by 2005&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Passages&quot;, which the I Suoni delle Dolomiti festival in Northern Italy commissioned to be performed at a high altitude, Douglas initiated his 2013 tenure as the Monterey Jazz Festival&#x27;s &quot;Showcase Artist&quot; with a benefit concert and hike at Glen Deven Ranch in Big Sur, California. The audience and performers alike hiked to a promontory overlooking the Pacific Ocean and then listened to a concert of Douglas&#x27; music.

In celebration of his 50th birthday, Douglas launched his &quot;50 States Project&quot; and set out to perform in each of the 50 U.S. states throughout the course of 2013. The tour aimed to include performances in &quot;unlikely and outdoors locations for people who might not otherwise have the same kind of access to live, improvised music as those in larger cities.&quot; The tour also coincided with the release of ‘DD|50: Special Edition 50th Birthday Recordings’ a special box set that included three CDs (&quot;Pathways&quot;, &quot;Time Travel&quot;, and &quot;Be Still&quot;) and a DVD containing previously unreleased in-studio performances and art videos shot by Christoph Green.

Douglas formed the collective ensemble Riverside in collaboration with tenor saxophonist Chet Doxas, electric bassist Steve Swallow and drummer Jim Doxas out of a shared respect for Texas-born multireedist Jimmy Giuffre. The group&#x27;s eponymously titled recording features originals by Douglas and Doxas, as well as Giuffre&#x27;s &quot;The Train and the River&quot;. The group&#x27;s sophomore album &quot;The New National Anthem&quot; was released in May 2017 featuring the pianist and composer Carla Bley. The album features three compositions by Bley, as well as songs by Douglas, Swallow and Doxas. The group played a number of concerts and festivals in the summer and fall of 2017 with Bley as a special guest, including two concerts in Quebec and a ten-date tour of Europe

In July 2014, Douglas released a duo project &quot;Present Joys&quot; with his long-time collaborator, pianist Uri Caine. The two explore the music of the Sacred Harp tradition, taking on four pieces from the shape-note tune books as well as several new Douglas compositions undertaken in the same vein. The duo expanded with the addition of drummer Andrew Cyrille. The trio released &quot;Devotion&quot; in 2019, performing Douglas compositions inspired by Franco D’Andrea, Carla Bley, Mary Lou Williams, and Dizzy Gillespie.

The Monash Art Ensemble (MAE) is a collaboration between the Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and the Australian Art Orchestra (AAO), an improvising chamber orchestra including some of Melbourne&#x27;s finest players also affiliated with Monash University. In 2014, Dave composed a set of music drawing inspiration from composers of the early 14th century French Ars Nova, most notably Guillaume De Machaut. Scored for four winds, four brass, four strings, and four percussion, including electronics, the music explores ideas of hocket, isorhythm, and modal counterpoint as points of departure, mixing improvisation with timbre and structure in unexpected ways. The resulting album, &quot;Fabliaux&quot;, was released in 2015 on Greenleaf Music in collaboration with Australian label JazzHead.

Dave first met DJ, producer and beatmaker Shigeto (Ghostly International) at a Red Bull Music Academy event that paired musicians in a series of solo and duet improvisations, and the two found some common creative ground. Following that collaboration, Douglas formed an electronic ensemble to probe the possibilities of improvised jazz and electronic music. Adding Jonathan Maron on electric and acoustic bass and Mark Guiliana on electric and acoustic drums, as well as engineer Geoff Countryman - whose knowledge and skills as a musician and technician helped piece everything together – the group released &quot;High Risk&quot; in 2015. The group&#x27;s follow up album, &quot;Dark Territory&quot;, was released on LP as a Record Store Day 2016 Exclusive.

In the fall of 2015, Dave released Brazen Heart, an album featuring his longstanding quintet with Jon Irabagon, Matt Mitchell, Linda May Han Oh, and Rudy Royston. The title track was commissioned for the Ecstatic Music Festival as a piece for large brass ensemble to be performed at the World Trade Center site in lower Manhattan, reimagined for a small group. Following a North American tour, the quintet played a week of shows at the Jazz Standard in November 2015. Recorded on the fly, each night&#x27;s music was released the next day for digital download on Bandcamp, allowing fans to hear the music with a remarkable turnaround. The complete set of music – four nights, eight sets, eighty-four tracks in total – was released as &quot;Brazen Heart Live&quot;, an 8-CD box set. PopMatters compared the release to Miles Davis’ The Complete Live
at the Plugged Nickel 1965 sessions.

In 2016, Douglas joined with French pianist Frank Woeste, bassist Matt Brewer and drummer Clarence Penn to produce a cooperative album with support from the French-American Jazz Exchange. &quot;Dada People&quot; was inspired by the Dada art movement and the work of Man Ray and his circle of artists.

Douglas composed a series of twelve short compositions, each named for an Italian month of the year entitled &quot;New Sanctuary&quot;. The 2016 work touches on his compositional process from 1996&#x27;s&quot;Sanctuary&quot;. It challenges the performers to maximally tease out the implications of each idea, using their own personal vocabulary to develop and explore the music in fresh ways every time. Douglas recorded the music in a new trio with guitarist Marc Ribot and percussionist Susie Ibarra.

In 2017, Douglas released &quot;Little Giant Still Life&quot;, featuring the brass quartet, The Westerlies. After encountering the group at Seattle&#x27;s Earshot Jazz Festival, Douglas began writing music for group of ensemble improvisors, later adding drummer Anwar Marshall. Much of the music is inspired by the American painter Stuart Davis.

Douglas’ 2018 Subscriber Series is entitled, &quot;UPLIFT&quot;. Subtitled, “Twelve Pieces For Positive Action,” the music was conceived by Douglas as a response to the tumultuous political and social climate of the United States and beyond. Featuring twelve new Douglas compositions for a new sextet, each piece highlights a specific social cause and references organizations doing important work. The ensemble, which came together to record the music in December 2017, features saxophonist Joe Lovano, guitarists Mary Halvorson and Julian Lage, bassist Bill Laswell and drummer Ian Chang. Throughout 2018, a new track was released each month exclusively for subscribers with a CD coming out in December 2018. A descendant of UPLIFT, Douglas recorded a program of brand new compositions – &quot;ENGAGE&quot; - as reactions and ruminations on hope and positivity. Douglas sought out specific improvisers and collaborators from different generations and backgrounds to deal with music that inspires, challenges and stirs to action. The songs were specifically built for this collaborative and dynamic ensemble including woodwind player Anna Webber, cellist Tomeka Reid, guitarist Jeff Parker, bassist Nick Dunston and drummer Kate Gentile. On some of the pieces, the ensemble is joined by trumpeters Dave Adewumi and Riley Mulherkar. The twelve pieces are built using the compositional rule of major triads, with each of the twelve pieces in the “song cycle” approaching these triads in a different way. The pieces were released monthly during 2019 to Greenleaf Music subscribers, and a culminating CD was released in December 2019.

===2020-present===
To honor the legacy of the great trumpeter, composer and humanist Dizzy Gillespie, Douglas wanted to explore Dizzy&#x27;s experimental and wide open mind as well as the influence of his music. The project started out as a concert program, assembled for a performance presented by Jazz at Lincoln Center in February, 2018. For that, Douglas assembled a sextet that included Ambrose Akinmusire on trumpet, guitarist Bill Frisell, pianist Gerald Clayton, bassist Linda May Han Oh and Joey Baron on drums. Douglas began to conceive of a recorded version of the program, although with a different set of players. In addition to Baron, Douglas brought trumpeter Dave Adewumi, guitarist Matthew Stevens, pianist Fabian Almazan, and bassist Carmen Rothwell into the studio. The resulting album &quot;Dizzy Atmosphere: Dizzy Gillespie at Zero Gravity&quot; was released in 2020.

Douglas collaborated again with the Monash Art Ensemble in 2020 as a virtual Artist in Residence. Working with a 13-piece ensemble, the musicians workshopped five pieces that Dave composed with inspiration from the Australian writer and poet Kevin Gilbert, along with lyrics contributed by ensemble members. Recording online and remotely, everyone recorded their parts separately and the music was blended together after the fact. &quot;The Dream: Monash Sessions&quot; was released in digital format in March 2021.

For the 2020 Greenleaf Music Subscriber Series, Douglas recorded a suite entitled, Marching Music. Subtitled &quot;Music to March By&quot;, Douglas conceived of these pieces as music you could have in your headphones when you attend Climate Marches, Demonstrations for Equal Rights, Voting Rights Movements, and all other actions towards a just society. Featuring a special quartet with guitarist Rafiq Bhatia, bassist Melvin Gibbs and drummer Sim Cain, the ten pieces were released throughout 2020 to subscribers.

On December 4, 2020, Douglas released the album &quot;Overcome&quot; exclusively to Bandcamp, featuring vocalist Fay Victor, vocalist and guitarist Camila Meza, bassist Jorge Roeder, and drummer Rudy Royston. The album includes a version of “We Shall Overcome”, a gospel song that is best known as a protest song of the American civil rights movement. Having been recorded remotely in first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was eventually issued on vinyl and via digital distribution in 2022.

In 2021, Douglas was approached by the Kerrytown Concert House in Ann Arbor to produce an online solo trumpet concert, which was live streamed in December 2021. Using some of that material, plus some additional performances online for Greenleaf subscribers, the album &quot;Hudson Solos&quot; emerged, all tied to thoughts about the Hudson River. A number of the pieces were released to Greenleaf Music subscribers in 2021 as part of the Subscribers Series and a CD was released in late 2021.

&quot;Secular Psalms&quot; is a new Dave Douglas studio album featuring a newly commissioned suite of ten pieces, inspired by and dedicated to The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb by Jan van Eyck and Hubert van Eyck – a polyptych originally painted for display in St. Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium. Commissioned by Handelsbeurs Concert Hall in Gent, Belgium to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Altarpiece with creation of new music. Drawing on Latin Mass, on early medieval folk songs, on composers of the period, like Guillaume DuFay, and on jazz and improvised music, Douglas and team deliver a lyrical, mystical, spiritual score full of upbeat optimism for our times. Douglas says the title refers to “songs of praise for all of us.” For this project Douglas branched out into new instruments including serpent, lute, organ and sampler, providing a painterly panorama of new sounds, and performed by group of international musicians: Tomeka Reid, Marta Warelis, Berlinde Deman, Frederick Leroux and Lander Gyselinck. The world premiere of the piece took place in Europe in November 2021 with performances in Gent and Brugge Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The CD was released by Greenleaf Music in April 2022. The albums and their compositions reference the Song of Ascents, a set of songs from the Book of Psalms.

The Dave Douglas Quintet featuring Irabagon, Mitchell, Oh, and Royston reunited to release its fourth studio album, &quot;Songs of Ascent: Book 1 - Degrees&quot; on October 7, 2022. The ensemble simultaneously released a second album, &quot;Songs of Ascent: Book 2 - Steps&quot; directly to subscribers of Greenleaf Music. Douglas recorded all his trumpet parts for both albums first, recording remotely with the musicians from their homes.

In March 2023, Douglas released &quot;If There Are Mountains&quot; with pianist Elan Mehler, featuring haiku sung by vocalist Dominique Eade. The album had previously been released in 2020 only on vinyl through Mehler&#x27;s independent label Newvelle Records. The recorded ensemble, a sextet, also includes John Gunther, Simón Willson, and Dayeon Seok.

==Personal life==
Douglas lives in the New York area, lectures regularly at The New School and travels frequently worldwide as a composer and performer. His daughter Mia was born in 1984.

<text>Edward Hayes Plumptre (6 August 1821 – 1 February 1891) was an English divine and scholar born in London.

==Life==
He was born on 6 August 1821, being the son of Edward Hallows Plumptre, a London solicitor. Charles John Plumptre was his brother. 
He was educated at home, and after a brief stay at King&#x27;s College, London, entered Oxford as a scholar of University College, Oxford, of which his uncle, Frederick Charles Plumptre (1796–1870), was master from 1836 till his death. In 1844, he took a double first-class, alone in mathematics, and in classics with Sir George Bowen, Dean Bradley, and E. Poste. 
He was elected to a fellowship at Brasenose College, which he resigned three years afterwards, on his marriage with Harriet Theodosia, sister of Frederick Denison Maurice. For some years the influence of his brother-in-law was apparent in his religious views, but as he advanced in life he identified himself with no party. 

==Service==
He was ordained in 1847, by Bishop Wilberforce, he proceeded M.A. in 1847, and joined the staff of King&#x27;s College London.
There his work mainly lay for twenty-one years, and he enlarged the scope of the institution by introducing evening classes. From 1847 to 1868, he was chaplain there, from 1853 to 1863 professor of pastoral theology, and from 1864 to 1881 professor of exegesis. He proved a most sympathetic teacher, and took a genuine interest in the future welfare of his pupils. 

Plumptre also took a leading part in promoting the higher education of women as a professor of Queen&#x27;s College, Harley Street, where he held the office of principal during the last two years of his work there (1875–77).
Throughout this period he was also occupied in clerical work. 
From 1851 to 1858, he was assistant preacher at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and in 1863 prebendary of St. Paul&#x27;s. 
He was rector of Pluckley from 1869 and of Bickley from 1873. 
He was Boyle lecturer in 1866, and the lectures were afterwards published under the title of &#x27;Christ and Christendom.&#x27; 
From 1869 to 1874, he was a member of the Old Testament revision committee, and from 1872 to 1874 Grinfield lecturer and examiner at Oxford.
In 1881, he resigned his work in London on becoming dean of Wells. 
He was an ideal dean, possessing a genuine talent for business, and being always ready to consider the suggestions of others; not only the cathedral and the Theological College, but the city of Wells, its hospital, its almshouse, and its workhouse, commanded his service.

Plumptre died on 1 February 1891 at the deanery of Wells, and was buried in the cathedral cemetery beside his wife, who had died on 3 April 1889. The marriage was childless.

==Published works==
Meanwhile, his pen was never idle. He wrote much on the interpretation of scripture, endeavouring to combine and popularise, in no superficial fashion, the results attained by labourers in special sections of the subject. He contributed to the commentaries known respectively as the &quot;Cambridge Bible&quot;, the &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Commentary,&quot; the commentary edited by Charles Ellicott, and the &quot;Bible Educator&quot; (serial from 1873 to 1875). He also wrote &quot;Biblical Studies&quot; (1870, 3rd edit. 1885), &quot;St. Paul in Asia&quot; (1877), a &quot;Popular Exposition of the Epistles to the Seven Churches&quot; (1877 and 1879), &quot;Movements in Religious Thought: Romanism, Protestantism, Agnosticism&quot; (1879), and &quot;Theology and Life&quot; (1884). His most remarkable theological work was &quot;The Spirits in Prison, and other studies on Life after Death&quot; (1884 and 1885). The book comprises a review of previous teaching on the subject of eschatology. His characteristic sympathy with &#x27;the larger hope&#x27; is moderated throughout by a characteristic caution. He had passed beyond the influence of Maurice, and, though his loyal admiration for his earlier teacher remained unchanged, he had rejected his conclusions.
In 1888, he issued a little work on &quot;Wells Cathedral and its Deans&quot;, and his &quot;Life of Bishop Ken&quot; appeared in the same year. Though diffuse, the book has something of the charm of Walton&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;, and breathes the still air of a cathedral. Its main defect is the occasional intrusion of conjectural or &#x27;ideal&#x27; biography.
Plumptre published several volumes of verse. He had a keen perception of literary excellence, unappeasable ambition, and unwearied industry; but his gifts were hardly sufficient to insure him a place among the poets. &quot;Lazarus&quot; and other poems appeared in 1864, 8vo (3rd edit. 1868); &quot;Master and scholar,&quot; which was warmly praised in the &quot;Westminster Review,&quot; in 1866, 8vo; and &quot;Things New and Old&quot; in 1884, 8vo. 

All his pieces are refined and earnest; few are really forcible.

Several of Plumptre&#x27;s hymns have been admitted into popular collections, and satisfy their not very exacting requirements. He also translated with much success the plays of Sophocles (1865) and of Æschylus (1868), and thus gave readers ignorant of Greek some adequate conception of the masterpieces of Attic drama. For twenty years he studied Dante, and his English version of Dante&#x27;s work appeared as &quot;The Divina Commedia and Canzoniere of Dante Alighieri; with Biographical Introduction, Notes and Essays&quot; (vol. i. 1886, 8vo, vol. ii. 1887).

<text>Tagliatelle (; from the Italian word , meaning &#x27;to cut&#x27;) are a traditional type of pasta from the Italian regions of Emilia-Romagna and Marche. Individual pieces of tagliatelle are long, flat ribbons that are similar in shape to fettuccine and are traditionally about wide. Tagliatelle can be served with a variety of sauces, though the classic is a meat sauce or Bolognese sauce.

Tagliatelle are traditionally made with egg pasta. The traditional ratio is one egg to one hundred grams of flour.

==Origins==
The term &quot;tagliatelle&quot; can be traced back to the Renaissance, with one of its first written records appearing in a treaty by Cristoforo di Messisbugo, steward of the House of Este in Ferrara, published in 1549. Tagliatelle are also mentioned in 1593 among the main pasta shapes by the humanist Tommaso Garzoni.

A glass case in the Bologna chamber of commerce holds a solid gold replica of a piece of tagliatella, demonstrating the correct width of when cooked, equivalent to uncooked, depending on the hardness of the dough.

==Dishes==
Tagliatelle have a porous and rough texture, making them ideal for thick sauces, generally made with beef, veal, or pork (such as Bolognese sauce), and occasionally with rabbit, as well as several other less rich (and more vegetarian) options, such as (with breadcrumbs and nuts), (with eggs and cheese), or simply (with tomatoes and basil).

==Early life and education==
Livingston was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Kurt Livingston, an aerospace electronics engineer, and Linda (née Rinas), a Lutheran pastor. He has two brothers and one sister. His younger brother, John, is also an actor. Both his sister, Jennifer Livingston, and brother-in-law, Mike Thompson, were TV news personalities at WKBT-DT in La Crosse, Wisconsin. 

Livingston attended Yale University, where he sang with The Whiffenpoofs and graduated in 1989, together with Anderson Cooper.

Livingston first acted at Theatre Cedar Rapids after being introduced to the group during a school job shadowing. Livingston moved to Chicago and became involved in the local theatre scene.

<doc id="456367" wikidata="Q2568572" url="?curid=456367" title="Cobalt, Ontario">
<text>Cobalt is a town in Timiskaming District, Ontario, Canada. It had a population of 989 at the 2021 Census.

In the early 1900s, the area was heavily mined for silver; the silver ore also contained cobalt. By 1910, the community was the fourth highest producer of silver in the world. Mining declined significantly by the 1930s, together with the local population. In late 2017 one publication referred to Cobalt as a ghost town, but the high demand for cobalt, used in making batteries for mobile devices and electric vehicles, is leading to great interest in the area among mining companies.

==History==

W.E. Logan discovered cobalt in 1884 at the future site of the Agaunico Mine, one mile south of Haileybury.

Silver was discovered in the area during the construction of the Temiskaming &amp; Northern Ontario Railway (T&amp;NO) from North Bay to the communities of Haileybury and New Liskeard, north of Cobalt. The discovery was made in 1903, near Long Lake (later called Cobalt Lake), by Ernest Darragh and James McKinley, who were supplying railway ties. Later that year, Tom Hébert found a rich vein on the east side of Cobalt Lake and began a business with hotel owner Arthur Ferland. The silver from both sites was consistently high-grade.

===Boomtown===
The subsequent Cobalt silver rush led to the development of the McKinley Darragh, La Rose, Nipissing, and O&#x27;Brien silver mines. In 1904, Willet Miller, on a visit to Mile 104 on the T&amp;NO, along with brothers Noah and Henry Timmins, named the future town Cobalt. The Timmins brothers bought the remaining claims from Fred La Rose, and erected some cabins.

Speculation over mining stocks on Wall Street in New York City required mounted police to control the crowds. The town was incorporated in 1906.

By 1908, the camp was considered the world&#x27;s largest producer of silver and of the cobalt which is a byproduct of the process.

In 1911, the 34 mines produced over 30 million ounces (937.5 tons) of silver. The town&#x27;s population soared to 10,000 by 1909.

During 1914 the main mines in operation were the City of Cobalt Mining Company, Combat Comet Mine, Cobalt Lake (who owned the bed and edge of the lake), Cobalt Townsite, Colonial Silver Mine, Coniagas Mine, Crown Reserve Mine, the Drummon Fraction Could, Hargrave, Hudson Bay, Kerr Lake, La Rose Consolidated, Lumsden, McKinley-Darragh-Savage, Meteor, Nipissing, O&#x27;Brien, Penn-Canadian, Peterson Lake, Provincial, Seneca-Superior, Silver Bar, Temiskaming, Trethewey, and York-Ontario.

Mining continued until the 1930s, then slowed to a trickle. Activity renewed in the 1950s then slowly dropped off, and since the 1980s, there have been no operating mines in the area. By the 1960s, the area had produced over 420 million ounces of silver. One mill still operated in the area in 2017, and exploration for diamonds and other minerals was ongoing.

The silver mines of Cobalt, and the prospectors and miners who discovered them and worked them, left an indelible mark on Canadian history, and the town is known as the birthplace of hard rock mining in Canada. The ore in Cobalt was close to surface, so men with limited experience could prospect, begin mining, and then hone their skills as the mines went deeper. Those who learned their trade in Cobalt moved north, discovering gold in Kirkland Lake and Timmins and further afield in Canada and around the world. Cobalt mining was done with the use of wheelbarrows, pickaxes, hand steel and dynamite.

===Fires===
Cobalt suffered two devastating fires in the 20th century. In 1909, a fire in a cafe spread quickly through debris and garbage-filled alleyways. Half the town was destroyed; 150 buildings were lost and 3,000 residents left homeless; by that time the water table had been contaminated and a typhoid outbreak earlier in the year had killed 111 people.
Fire protection at the time was inadequate and firefighters were forced to dynamite buildings to create a firebreak. On a hot and windy Victoria Day in 1977, a discarded cigarette started a fire that destroyed 140 buildings and left over 400 homeless.

===Hockey===
The Cobalt Silver Kings played in the inaugural 1910 NHA season.

===Administration===
Cobalt, Haileybury, and New Liskeard were formerly known as the Tri-Towns. When Haileybury and New Liskeard were amalgamated into the city of Temiskaming Shores in 2004, Cobalt decided to remain a separate town. However, the two municipalities continue to have a close relationship, including the operation of a shared public transit system.

In 2001 Cobalt was named &quot;Ontario&#x27;s Most Historic Town&quot; by a in panel of judges on the TV Ontario program &quot;Studio 2&quot;, and in 2002 the &quot;Cobalt Mining District&quot; was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

===Renewed interest in cobalt and silver mining===

Cobalt is a byproduct of silver mining and was not of significant interest as a mineral until recently; in fact, many considered it to be a &quot;nuisance&quot;. Today, however, it is a critical component in the types of rechargeable lithium battery used in millions of mobile devices and in electric cars, and demand is expected to increase. This application for the mineral was not yet possible in the mid-1980s when the last mining company, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited, ceased operations in the area. Cobalt is always mixed not only with silver but also with copper, nickel and other metals.

By 2017, several cobalt exploration companies were focusing on the area around Cobalt, as one alternative to cobalt mining in the politically-unstable Democratic Republic of Congo. Roughly 60% of the world&#x27;s cobalt is mined in the Congo, much of it using child labour in very poor working conditions. Major companies that require this mineral for their batteries were searching for ethically-sourced product. The shortage of such cobalt is a primary reason for the 300% increase in the price of this commodity since 2015.

Stock prices of First Cobalt Corp. and Cobalt 27 Capital Corp. had soared in 2017 based on this prospect. The CEO of First Cobalt made this comment after returning from a trip to the U.S., Europe, Australia and Asia: &quot;We&#x27;ve got some of the biggest resource companies in the world interested&quot;. In October, the company was planning to prospect the Caswell, Ophir and Silver Banner areas, as well as mines around Kerr Lake and Maiden Lake, via the staff of Bjorkman Prospecting of Whiskey Jack, Ontario. At the time, First Cobalt was negotiating a merger with two other companies, Cobalt One and CobalTech. If the merger is completed, the group expected to control about 45% of the potential mining properties in the Cobalt area including 50 mines that previously produced cobalt and silver; a competitor, Agnico Eagle, controls approximately 21%. However the latter ceased production there in the 1980s.

Silver was selling for US$17 per ounce in late November 2017, down significantly from its peak of US$50 in 2012, but cobalt was at about US$31 per pound at that time, up significantly from the US$10 price in late 2015. The prices will increase according to Gino Chitaroni, the president of the Northern Prospectors&#x27; Association. He also predicted that the area around Cobalt would be a primary source of both minerals. &quot;It&#x27;s spectacular ... We have the infrastructure. We have a historic mining area. It puts us a step up on anywhere [else] in the world.&quot;

In March 2017, the town&#x27;s mayor estimated that mining production could start in about three to five years.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cobalt had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Environmental issues==
The mining activities in Cobalt have left a significant environmental legacy. Millions of tons of mine waste rock and mill tailings were dumped on the land and in local lakes. In cobalt ores, silver was associated with arsenic minerals. Some of it ended up in the tailings and waste rock. Today this arsenic contaminates surface water in the area and is believed to pose risks to the environment. Sediment samples from surrounding lakes showed elevated concentration levels of nickel, copper and arsenic while water samples exceeded the provincial water quality guideline for cobalt and arsenic. Fish from five of the lakes around Cobalt had mercury concentration which exceeded the consumption limit as well as elevated concentration for arsenic.

The Cobalt area is also laced with many miles of underground mine workings, surface trenches, pits and shaft openings. As a result, there are risks of collapse, or subsidence of underground mine workings, and many areas have been fenced off to prevent entry.

==Tourism and attractions==
Visitors to Cobalt can visit the Cobalt Mining Museum, which boasts the world&#x27;s largest display of locally mined silver, as well as &quot;The Bunker&quot; military museum and the Northern Ontario Firefighters Museum. The Heritage Silver Trail is a self-guided driving tour of several mine and mill sites in the area. The trail is well marked, guiding visitors around the backroads of Cobalt. At each site, signs are posted, identifying the site, and providing a brief description of the site. The trail guides visitors to many of the remaining mine headframes in the Cobalt area, some of which are quite picturesque, and stand as an important reminder of Cobalt&#x27;s past.

Visitors can also take a tour of an old underground mine. Tours start at the Mining Museum, and are guided by museum staff. The narrow damp tunnels of the mine give a real appreciation for the conditions under which miners worked, and tour guides sprinkle the tour with many stories to help bring the past to life.

On February 14, 2008, plans were announced to convert the vacant Fraser Hotel building into a complex which will include The Bunker museum, housing units, tourist accommodations, and a proposed culinary school.

Passenger rail service continued to be provided from the Cobalt railway station on the Ontario Northland Railway&#x27;s Northlander train (it was during the building of this line that silver had been discovered in Cobalt) until it was discontinued on September 28, 2012.

A notable tourist attraction in the area in the 20th century was the Highway Book Shop, which closed in 2011.

<text>The fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) is a common species of salamander found in Europe.

It is black with yellow spots or stripes to a varying degree; some specimens can be nearly completely black while on others the yellow is dominant. Shades of red and orange may sometimes appear, either replacing or mixing with the yellow according to subspecies. This bright coloration is highly conspicuous and acts to deter predators by honest signalling of its toxicity (aposematism). Fire salamanders can have a very long lifespan; one specimen lived for more than 50 years in Museum Koenig, a German natural history museum.

Despite its wide distribution and abundance, it is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to its susceptibility to infection by the introduced fungus &quot;Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans&quot;, which has caused severe declines in fire salamanders in parts of its range.

== Taxonomy ==
Several subspecies of the fire salamander are recognized. Most notable are the subspecies &quot;fastuosa&quot; and &quot;bernadezi&quot;, which are the only viviparous subspecies – the others are ovoviviparous.
* &quot;S. s. alfredschmidti&quot;
* &quot;S. s. almanzoris&quot; 
* &quot;S. s. bejarae&quot;
* &quot;S. s. bernardezi&quot;
* &quot;S. s. beschkovi&quot;
* &quot;S. s. crespoi&quot;
* &quot;S. s. fastuosa&quot; (or &quot;bonalli&quot;) – yellow-striped fire salamander
* &quot;S. s. gallaica&quot; – Galician fire salamander
* &quot;S. s. gigliolii&quot;
* &quot;S. s. morenica&quot;
* &quot;S. s. salamandra&quot; – spotted fire salamander, nominate subspecies
* &quot;S. s. terrestris&quot; – barred fire salamander
* &quot;S. s. werneri&quot;

Some former subspecies have been lately recognized as species for genetic reasons.
* &quot;S. algira&quot; Bedriaga, 1883 – African fire salamander
* &quot;S. corsica&quot; Savi, 1838 – Corsican fire salamander
* &quot;S. infraimmaculata&quot; Martens, 1885 – Near Eastern fire salamander (arouss al ayn)

== Distribution ==

Fire salamanders are found in most of southern and central Europe. They are most commonly found at altitudes between and , only rarely below (in Northern Germany sporadically down to ). However, in the Balkans or Spain they are commonly found in higher altitudes as well.

The scientific article titled &quot;Water, Stream Morphology and Landscape: Complex Habitat Determinants for the Fire Salamander Salamandra salamandra&quot; explored the factors influencing the distribution of the fire salamander, a semiaquatic amphibian species, in northern Italy. The study aimed to understand the relationship between environmental features and species distribution, essential for effective habitat conservation.

Researchers evaluated three main factors: stream morphology, biotic features of water, and the composition of the surrounding landscape near wetlands. They collected data from 132 localities over four years and used an information-theoretic approach to build species distribution models. Variance partitioning was then employed to assess the relative importance of environmental variables.

The findings revealed that the distribution of fire salamander larvae was associated with specific environmental conditions. They were found in heterogeneous and shallow streams with scarce periphyton (a type of algae) and rich macrobenthos (aquatic invertebrates), characteristic of oligotrophic water. Additionally, the presence of woodlands in the surrounding landscape played a crucial role in the species&#x27; distribution.

The study emphasized the interconnectedness of multiple factors in determining Salamandra salamandra distribution. Stream morphology was the most influential variable, but the combined effects of water features and landscape composition also played significant roles. The article underscores the importance of considering both aquatic and upland habitats in conservation efforts for these and other semiaquatic amphibians.

===Genetic differentiation by population===
A 2021 research project investigated the role of physical and ecological isolation in shaping genetic differentiation patterns among populations and subspecies of the fire salamander in central Iberia. Researchers utilized microsatellite genetic data and environmental dissimilarity measures to assess the impact of both types of isolation on genetic connectivity.

The analysis revealed significant genetic diversity variation across the study area, with lower diversity in eastern populations near the range limit and higher diversity in western and central populations. The study identified strong genetic structure, as populations from the Iberian Central System (ICS) and the Montes de Toledo Range (MTR) formed distinct genetic groups. Physical isolation, represented by landscape resistance, played a substantial role in genetic differentiation between populations across all spatial extents. Different types of landscape resistance, such as climate-based and landcover-based, provided the best model fits in different regions. The researchers proposed a scenario where gene flow between two subspecies, S. s. bejarae and S. s. almanzoris, was restricted by ecological isolation associated with sharp transitions in precipitation seasonality. However, gene flow between populations with intermediate levels of precipitation seasonality was less restricted. The results provided evidence for ongoing environmental adaptation, leading to the maintenance of distinct ecotypes and evolutionary units.
== Habitat, behavior and diet ==
Fire salamanders live in the forests of central Europe and are more common in hilly areas. They prefer deciduous forests since they like to hide in fallen leaves and around mossy tree trunks. They need small brooks or ponds with clean water in their habitat for the development of the larvae. Whether on land or in water, fire salamanders are inconspicuous. They spend much of their time hidden under wood or other objects. They are active in the evening and the night, but on rainy days they are active in the daytime as well.

The diet of the fire salamander consists of various insects, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, earthworms and slugs, but they also occasionally eat newts and young frogs. In captivity, they eat crickets, mealworms, waxworms and silkworm larvae. Small prey will be caught within the range of the vomerine teeth or by the posterior half of the tongue, to which the prey adheres. It weighs about 40 grams. Compared to other salamanders in the region like &quot;Luschan&#x27;s salamander&quot;, the fire salamander has been shown to be larger and appears to have a more solid pectoral girdle. Additionally, it has a longer pectoral girdle than Luschan’s salamander. The fire salamander is one of Europe&#x27;s largest salamanders and can grow to be long.

===Diet and habitat interaction===
A study in 2013 aimed to investigate the foraging behavior of fire salamander larvae from different environments, specifically caves and streams, and to understand the roles of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in shaping their behavior. The researchers conducted a behavioral experiment using newborn larvae from 11 caves and nine streams in northwest Italy. In the experiment, the larvae were individually maintained in laboratory conditions and subjected to different test conditions, including light/darkness, prey presence/absence, and food deprivation/normal feeding. Video tracking was used to quantify the larvae&#x27;s movements and foraging strategies.

The results revealed significant differences in foraging behavior between cave and stream larvae. The cave larvae exhibited a more active foraging strategy, especially in darkness and in the absence of prey, suggesting local adaptations to the challenging cave environment with limited food resources. Stream larvae, on the other hand, preferred using peripheral sectors of the test arena, indicating a preference for sit-and-wait behavior, which is advantageous in the presence of detectable and active prey.

The study demonstrated that fire salamander larvae are highly plastic in their foraging behavior. They adjusted their activity levels and movement patterns in response to changes in light conditions, prey availability, and food deprivation. The plastic responses observed were beneficial for increasing encounter rates with prey and optimizing energy utilization in resource-scarce environments. The study revealed an interplay between phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation in shaping the foraging behavior of fire salamander larvae. While plasticity appears to be dominant in the early stages of colonization and adaptation to new environments, local adaptations may also contribute to behavioral differences between cave and stream populations.

== Reproduction ==

Males and females look very similar, except during the breeding season, when the most conspicuous difference is a swollen gland around the male&#x27;s vent. This gland produces the spermatophore, which carries a sperm packet at its tip. The courtship happens on land. After the male becomes aware of a potential mate, he confronts her and blocks her path. The male rubs her with his chin to express his interest in mating, then crawls beneath her and grasps her front limbs with his own in amplexus. He deposits a spermatophore on the ground, then attempts to lower the female&#x27;s cloaca into contact with it. If successful, the female draws the sperm packet in and her eggs are fertilized internally. The eggs develop internally and the female deposits the larvae into a body of water just as they hatch. In some subspecies, the larvae continue to develop within the female until she gives birth to fully formed metamorphs. Breeding has not been observed in neotenic fire salamanders.

In captivity, females may retain sperm long-term and use the stored sperm later to produce another clutch. This behavior has not been observed in the wild, likely due to the ability to obtain fresh sperm and the degradation of stored sperm.
===Experimental and cave reproduction===
A European study investigated the breeding and developmental patterns of the fire salamander in both natural and artificial caves across various regions in Italy. The researchers conducted extensive surveys from 2008 to 2017, exploring a total of 292 sites, comprising 219 natural caves and 73 artificial caves. Among these sites, 52 were found to host underground breeding sites of fire salamanders, with 15 occurring in natural caves and 37 in artificial sites.

The experiment explored environmental features in determining larval distribution inside caves. Fire salamander larvae were observed to choose caves with specific characteristics, such as stable water presence, ease of access, and the presence of rich macrobenthos communities. Larval development in underground springs and natural caves was found to be slower compared to epigean environments, possibly influenced by factors such as temperature and food availability. Furthermore, the lack of light in caves influenced the predation behavior of larvae, with cave populations showing higher adaptability in capturing prey.
Cave environments presented unique challenges for fire salamanders, including food scarcity and the occurrence of cannibalism, particularly in resource-poor habitats. However, the study revealed that fire salamanders exhibited strong phenotypic plasticity, which allowed them to adapt and survive in these extreme underground conditions.

The research emphasizes the importance of local adaptations and phenotypic plasticity in the successful colonization of caves by fire salamanders. It also highlights the need for further genetic studies to understand the differentiation between cave and stream populations and the mechanisms driving successful cave exploitation. Despite challenges posed by large urodele genomes, future genome scan and transcriptomic approaches may provide valuable insights into the genetic processes involved in cave adaptation.
== Toxicity ==

The fire salamander&#x27;s primary alkaloid toxin, samandarin, causes strong muscle convulsions and hypertension combined with hyperventilation in all vertebrates. Through an analysis of the European fire salamander’s skin secretions, scientists have determined that another alkaloid, such as samandarone, is also released by the salamander. These steroids can be swabbed from the salamander’s parotid glands. Samandarine was often the dominant alkaloid present but the ratio varied between salamanders. This ratio, however, was not shown to be sex dependent. Larvae do not produce these alkaloids. Upon maturity, ovaries, livers, and testes appear to produce these defensive steroids.
The poison glands of the fire salamander are concentrated in certain areas of the body, especially around the head and the dorsal skin surface. The coloured portions of the animal&#x27;s skin usually coincide with these glands. Compounds in the skin secretions may be effective against bacterial and fungal infections of the epidermis; some are potentially dangerous to human life.

A 2002 study focused on investigating the variability of toxic alkaloids in the skin secretion of the European fire salamander. The chemical defense mechanisms of the salamander provides valuable insights into the chemical composition of skin secretions in amphibians. The two major alkaloids of focus were, samandarine and samandarone. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, the researchers analyzed individual specimens from two populations of fire salamanders and observed a high degree of intraspecific variability in the ratio of samandarine to samandarone in the skin secretion. Some individuals had a higher concentration of samandarone, while others exhibited equal levels of both alkaloids.

Internal organs contained either no or only small amounts of the alkaloids, and the ratio of alkaloids in the organs differed from that in the skin. Particularly noteworthy was the finding that the larvae found in the oviducts of gravid females were entirely free of alkaloids, and their skin lacked the typical granular glands that are present in adult salamanders. Samandarone may be a product of a separate biosynthetic pathway due to its exclusive presence in skin secretions and organ extracts.
==Environmental stressors and threats==

=== Introduced species ===
A research team conducted a comprehensive study investigating the impact of mosquitofish (&quot;Gambusia affinis&quot;) on endangered Near Eastern fire salamander (&quot;S. infraimmaculata&quot;) larvae in Israel. The research was conducted through a combination of field surveys and a mesocosm experiment to understand the potential threat posed by mosquitofish to the native amphibian population.

Researchers observed natural breeding pools of fire salamanders, both with and without mosquitofish. The presence of mosquitofish was found to have a detrimental effect on the salamander larvae, leading to reduced densities, smaller sizes, and lower tail:body ratios in the pools with mosquitofish. These observations indicated that mosquitofish predation was causing severe physical damage to the salamander larvae.

To further investigate, a mesocosm experiment was conducted. The researchers manipulated the presence of mosquitofish and structural complexity in the artificial breeding pools. The results supported the field observations, showing that mosquitofish had a significant negative impact on salamander survival, size, and body condition. The fish-inflicted damage included partial tail fins, gill injuries, and limb damage, leading to a reduced likelihood of successful metamorphosis for the salamander larvae in mosquitofish-present mesocosms.

Importantly, the study revealed that increased structural complexity (artificial vegetation) did not provide a refuge for the salamander larvae against mosquitofish predation, contrary to expectations. It was also noted that the use of mosquitofish for mosquito control in permanent ponds could lead to negative consequences for native amphibian populations, as the presence of mosquitofish posed a significant threat to the survival of the fire salamander larvae.

The experiment suggests that mosquitofish pose a serious threat to the endangered fire salamander population in Israel. It also highlights conserving the native amphibian species by reconsidering the use of mosquitofish for mosquito control in habitats where these vulnerable species breed. Efforts to remove mosquitofish from Salamandra-breeding sites are recommended to safeguard the long-term persistence of the fire salamander population and protect against potential ecological disruptions caused by invasive fish species.
=== &quot;Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans&quot; ===
In parts of its range, the fire salamander has become highly endangered by the spread of the introduced chytrid fungus &quot;Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans&quot;, which has had catastrophic effects on its population. This collapse was first identified from the Netherlands in 2013. The fire salamander in the Netherlands is teetering on the brink of extinction, confined to three small populations in the southern part of the country. Prior to these declines, they were already listed as &quot;Endangered&quot; on the national Red List, and their range had reduced by 57% since 1950, mainly due to changes in water availability and habitat degradation. The remaining populations were limited to specific areas of deciduous forests on hillsides, and their surface activity is restricted to humid periods with night temperatures above 5°C.The species had been considered stable until 2008 when dead individuals were observed, and since 2010, there has been a staggering 96% population decline, with the largest population dropping from 241 individuals to only four in 2011. In 2013, the cause of the decline was officially identified as a new chytrid fungus, &quot;Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans&quot; (&quot;Bsal&quot;), likely introduced to Europe from east Asia via captive amphibians.

Since its identification in the Netherlands, &quot;Bsal&quot; has continued to spread across western Europe, and has infected more populations of &quot;S. s. terrestris&quot; in Belgium and western Germany, with an isolated but contained occurrence in Spain affecting a population of &quot;S. s. hispanica&quot;. Dramatic declines have been noted in all affected populations, and some may eventually be entirely extirpated, although at most known sites, fire salamanders persist at low numbers even after disease outbreak, and in one case appear to have recovered. Some localities in the Eifel Mountains where fire salamanders were previously known from appear to now be devoid of fire salamanders, suggesting landscape-scale declines that occurred prior to the disease&#x27;s identification by science. In 2023, the fire salamander was officially moved from &#x27;Least Concern&#x27; to &#x27;Vulnerable&#x27; on the IUCN Red List, relating to the past and predicted future declines in the species.

<text>Thomas Ken (July 1637 – 19 March 1711) was an English cleric who was considered the most eminent of the English non-juring bishops, and one of the developers of modern English hymnody.

==Early life==

Thomas Ken was born in 1637 at Little Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire. His father was Thomas Ken of Furnival&#x27;s Inn, of the Ken family of Ken Place, in Somerset; his mother was the daughter of little known English poet John Chalkhill. In 1646 Ken&#x27;s stepsister, Anne, married Izaak Walton, author of &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, a connection which brought Ken under the influence of this gentle and devout man.

In 1652 Ken entered Winchester College, and in 1656 became a student of Hart Hall, Oxford. He gained a fellowship at New College in 1657, and proceeded B.A. in 1661 and M.A. in 1664. 
He was for some time tutor of his college; but the most characteristic reminiscence of his university life is the mention made by Anthony Wood that in the musical gatherings of the time Thomas Ken of New College, a junior, would be sometimes among them, and sing his part. 
Ordained in 1662, he successively held the livings of Little Easton in Essex, St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Brighstone in the Isle of Wight, and East Woodhay in Hampshire; in 1672 he resigned the last of these, and returned to Winchester, being by this time a prebendary of the cathedral, and chaplain to the bishop, as well as a fellow of Winchester College.

He remained there for several years, acting as curate in one of the lowest districts, preparing his &quot;Manual of Prayers for the use of the Scholars of Winchester College&quot; (first published in 1674), and composing hymns. 
It was at this time that he wrote, primarily for the same body as his prayers, his morning, evening and midnight hymns, the first two of which, beginning &quot;Awake, my soul, and with the sun&quot; and &quot;Glory to Thee, my God, this night&quot;, are well known. The latter is often made to begin with the line &quot;All praise to Thee, my God, this night&quot;, which is how it appeared in a 1692 pamphlet printed by Richard Smith. However, this publication was likely made without Ken&#x27;s permission, and subsequent editions over which he had control revert to &quot;Glory to Thee, my God, this night&quot;. Both of these hymns end with a doxology beginning &quot;Praise God, from whom all blessings flow,&quot; which is widely sung today by itself, often to the tune Old 100th. &quot;Awake, my soul, and with the sun&quot; was included as Hymn 1 in the first edition of &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot;, while &quot;Glory to Thee, my God, this night&quot; was Hymn 10.

In 1674 Ken paid a visit to Rome in company with his nephew, the young Isaac Walton (son of Ken&#x27;s sister Anne and the writer Izaak Walton), and this journey seems mainly to have resulted in confirming his regard for the Anglican communion.

==Ken and Charles II==
In 1679, Ken was appointed by Charles II chaplain to the Princess Mary, wife of William of Orange. While with the court at The Hague, he incurred the displeasure of William by insisting that a promise of marriage, made to an English lady of high birth by a relative of the prince, should be kept; and he therefore gladly returned to England in 1680, when he was immediately appointed one of the king&#x27;s chaplains.

He was once more residing at Winchester in 1683 when Charles came to the city with his slightly disreputable court. His residence was chosen as the home of Nell Gwynne, the King&#x27;s official mistress. Ken stoutly objected and succeeded in making the favourite find quarters elsewhere. In August of this same year he accompanied Lord Dartmouth to Tangier as chaplain to the fleet, and Pepys, who was one of the company, has left on record some quaint and kindly reminiscences of him and of his services on board.

The fleet returned in April 1684, and a few months later, upon a vacancy occurring in the see of Bath and Wells, Ken was appointed bishop. It is said that, upon the occurrence of the vacancy, the King, mindful of the spirit he had shown at Winchester, exclaimed, &quot;Where is the good little man that refused his lodging to poor Nell?&quot; and determined that no other should be bishop. The consecration took place at Lambeth on 25 January 1685; and one of Ken&#x27;s first duties was to attend the death-bed of Charles, where his wise and faithful ministrations won the admiration of everybody except Bishop Burnet.

In this year he published his &quot;Exposition on the Church Catechism&quot;, perhaps better known by its sub-title, &quot;The Practice of Divine Love&quot;.

== Ken and James II ==

In 1688, when James reissued his &quot;Declaration of Indulgence&quot;, Ken was one of the Seven Bishops who refused to publish it. He was probably influenced by two considerations: first, by his profound aversion to Roman Catholicism, to which he felt he would be giving some episcopal recognition by compliance; but, second and more especially, by the feeling that James was compromising the spiritual freedom of the church. Along with his six brethren, Ken was committed to the Tower on 8 June 1688, on a charge of high misdemeanour. Ken was put on trial with the others on 29 and 30 June, which resulted in a verdict of acquittal.

==The nonjuring schism==
With the Glorious Revolution which speedily followed this impolitic trial, new troubles encountered Ken; for, having sworn allegiance to James, he thought himself thereby precluded from taking the oath to William of Orange. Accordingly, he took his place among the non-jurors, and, as he stood firm to his refusal, he was, in August 1691, superseded in his bishopric by Dr Richard Kidder, dean of Peterborough.

From this time he lived mostly in retirement, finding a congenial home with Lord Weymouth, his friend from college days, at Longleat in Wiltshire; and though pressed by Queen Anne to resume his diocese in 1703, upon the death of Bishop Kidder, he declined, partly on the ground of growing weakness, but partly no doubt from his love for the quiet life of devotion which he was able to lead at Longleat. He did however persuade George Hooper to accept and made a cession to him. At Hooper&#x27;s instigation, Queen Anne granted Ken a pension of £200. He died there on 19 March 1711, and at dawn the following day, whilst his faithful friends sang &quot;Awake, my soul, and with the sun&quot; Bishop Ken&#x27;s remains were laid to rest beneath the East Window of the Church of St. John in Frome – the nearest parish in his old Diocese of Bath and Wells. &quot;I am dying,&quot; Ken had written, &quot;in the Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West; and, more particularly, in the Communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from both Papal and Puritan innovation, and adheres to the Doctrine of the Cross.&quot;

==Lodger at Longleat==

When deprived of his see by William and Mary in 1691 after he refused to transfer his oath of allegiance from James, on the grounds that once given, it could not be forsworn, he was given lodgings at Longleat and an £80 annuity by Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, a friend since Oxford days.

Ken was arrested with several others after the 1696 plot to kill King William; he was released shortly afterwards and worked on ending the schism between the nonjurors and the church.

After Kidder’s death in 1703, Queen Anne invited him to return to his post as Bishop of Bath and Wells; he declined. He took up his robe on only one occasion, the funeral of fellow nonjuror John Kettlewell.

Taking up residence on the top floor at Longleat for a period of some twenty years, he exerted a profound influence upon Thomas Thynne, becoming what some might describe as his conscience. Thynne thus acquired a reputation for good deeds, which he himself regarded as spontaneous enough, but which the friends of his youth were inclined to regard as having been inspired by his devout friend, the Bishop.

An example of such benevolence: In 1707, Thynne, influenced by Ken, founded a grammar school for boys in the nearby market town of Warminster, with 23 free places for local boys. Originally The Lord Weymouth School (and known locally as The Latin School), in 1973 this school merged with St Monica&#x27;s School for Girls to become the co-educational Warminster School, which continues to this day. Ken is remembered at Warminster School by the naming of a competitive &#x27;house&#x27; after him.

Notable too is the fact that a portion of the West Wing of Longleat was transformed into a chapel for the household&#x27;s daily worship. Not that its interior ever matched the architectural finery of equivalent chapels in other stately homes, but it was in any case evidence of the devout spirit which prevailed at Longleat over that particular historical period.

While living in the house at Longleat, Ken wrote many of his famous hymns, including &#x27;Awake my soul&#x27;, and, when he died in 1711, he bequeathed his extensive library to the 1st Viscount.

==Reputation and legacy==
Although Ken wrote much poetry, besides his hymns, he cannot be called a great poet; but he had that fine combination of spiritual insight and feeling with poetic taste which marks all great hymn-writers. As a hymn-writer he has had few equals in England; he wrote &quot;Praise God from whom all blessings flow&quot;. It can scarcely be said that even John Keble, though possessed of much rarer poetic gifts, surpassed him in his own sphere. In his own day he took high rank as a pulpit orator, and even royalty had to beg for a seat amongst his audiences; but his sermons are now forgotten. He lives in history, apart from his three hymns, mainly as a man of unstained purity and invincible fidelity to conscience, weak only in a certain narrowness of view. As an ecclesiastic he was a High Churchman of the old school.

Ken&#x27;s poetical works were published in collected form in four volumes by W. Hawkins, his relative and executor, in 1721; his prose works were issued in 1838 in one volume, under the editorship of J. T. Round. A brief memoir was prefixed by Hawkins to a selection from Ken&#x27;s works which he published in 1713; and a life, in two volumes, by the Rev. W. L. Bowles, appeared in 1830. But the standard biographies of Ken are those of John Lavicount Anderdon (&quot;The Life of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, by a Layman&quot;, 1851; 2nd ed., 1854) and of Dean Plumptre (2 vols., 1888; revised, 1890). See also the Rev. W. Hunt&#x27;s article in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

He was buried at the Church of St John the Baptist, Frome, where his crypt can still be seen. He is also commemorated with a statue in niche 177 on the West Front of Salisbury Cathedral.

Thomas Ken is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 8 June. He is also commemorated on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 21 March.

== In literature==
Thomas Ken appears in a number of novels: 
* Iain Pears&#x27; &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot; (1997) includes Ken as a young fellow of New College, Oxford, desperate to be appointed to a parish through the college&#x27;s patronage, so he can afford to marry. 
* Robert Neill&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Lillibullero&quot; (1975) depicts Ken as a devout and humane cleric attempting unsuccessfully to dissuade King James II from harsh retributions against the participants of the Monmouth Rebellion.

<text>Liberty University (LU), known simply as Liberty, is a private evangelical Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia, United States. It is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia (Southern Baptist Convention). Founded in 1971 by Jerry Falwell Sr. and Elmer L. Towns as Lynchburg Baptist College, Liberty is among the world&#x27;s largest Christian universities and one of the largest private non-profit universities in the United States by total student enrollment.

Liberty University consists of 17 colleges, including the Helms School of Government and the Rawlings School of Divinity. Most of its enrollment is in online courses; in 2020, the university enrolled about 15,000 in its residential program and 80,000 online. Its high number of students can be explained in particular by its tuition fees, which are among the lowest in the United States. Liberty&#x27;s athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the Liberty Flames. Their athletics program joined Conference USA as a full member in 2023.

The university requires undergraduate students to take three Evangelical Bible-studies classes. Its honor code, called the &quot;Liberty Way&quot;, prohibits premarital sex, cohabitation, any kind of romantic relationship between members of the same sex, and alcohol use. The code was alleged to make it difficult to report sexual violence in a 2021 lawsuit.

Liberty University is perceived as a &quot;bastion of the Christian right&quot;, playing a prominent role in Republican politics under Falwell and his son and successor Jerry Falwell Jr.; Falwell Jr. left in 2020 amid allegations of personal and professional impropriety and was later sued by the university. Dondi E. Costin is the current President of Liberty University.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===

The school was founded as Lynchburg Baptist College in 1971 by televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr. and Elmer L. Towns. Falwell, already a pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church, served as the first chancellor of the school. From 1979 to the late 1980s, Falwell Sr. also headed the Moral Majority, a right-wing political organization.

The school changed its name to Liberty Baptist College in 1976. Officials said the change aimed to distance the school from the name Lynchburg, which is often mistakenly associated with lynching; co-founder Towns also said that Falwell Sr., wanted to use the name &quot;Liberty&quot; to ride the enthusiasm for the Bicentennial of the United States.

The name changed again in 1984, to Liberty University. In 1985, the university launched a distance-learning program by mailing VHS tapes to students; this was the forerunner to Liberty University&#x27;s current online program. Two years later, Liberty University&#x27;s 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status was formally recognized by the IRS.

In its early decades, the university was held afloat financially by major donors. The university was placed on probation multiple times in the 1990s by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools due to heavy debt loads. In 1990, the university&#x27;s debt totaled $110 million; in 1996, it totaled $40million. In 1994, Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Federation for World Peace funneled $3.5 million to Liberty University.

=== Modern history ===
In 2004, Liberty University named its School of Government for Jesse Helms, a former U.S. senator from North Carolina and a Falwell family friend.

In 2005, &quot;Barron&#x27;s Profiles of American Colleges&quot; ranked undergraduate admission to LU as &quot;competitive&quot;, its fourth-highest of six ranks. When high-speed Internet connections became more widespread around 2005, Liberty began to offer online courses to a larger adult population.

After Falwell Sr. died in 2007, his son Jerry Falwell Jr. became the university&#x27;s second chancellor and fourth president. At the time, the university listed $259 million in assets.

Liberty University Online Academy was formed in 2007, serving 23 students.

In 2009, Liberty University withdrew official recognition of the student Young Democrats club, saying that the club&#x27;s political positions, including support of abortion rights, conflicted with the school&#x27;s. The school&#x27;s College Republicans club remains officially recognized.

In 2010, Liberty students received about $445 million in federal financial aid money, the highest total of any school in Virginia and one of the highest in the country. A 56 percent increase over the previous year, the money was mostly in the form of student loans, but also included some grants and other forms of aid.

In 2011, Liberty blocked campus internet access to the website of a local newspaper, the &quot;News &amp; Advance,&quot; after it reported that the university received more federal financial aid than any other school in Virginia. Falwell Jr. refused to say why the block was imposed, said it was unrelated to anything published in the newspaper, and said that the &quot;News &amp; Advance&quot; had been blocked on campus before. The block was lifted one day after the financial-aid article was published.

, the university&#x27;s endowment stood at more than $1billion and gross assets exceeded $2billion.

In November 2020, Liberty University graduate and athletics booster Bob Good won a seat in the US House of Representatives, making him the first Liberty graduate to be in the House.

On March 31, 2023, Dondi Costin was named president of Liberty University.

Liberty University is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election.

It houses a RC Optical Systems Truss Ritchey-Chrétien and several Celestron CPC 800 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes on pedestals, able to roll out under a roof. The observatory serves three purposes: instruction, public nights and research. Student Activities controls the use of the observatory and is open to all students.

In 2018, Liberty University opened a $3.2 million on-campus shooting range to train students to protect themselves against shooters and terrorists.

=== Libraries and museums ===

==== Jerry Falwell Library ====
The four-story, 170,000-square-foot Jerry Falwell Library opened in January 2014 with more than 250,000 items and room for another 170,000. They are accessible via a robot-assisted storage and retrieval system, which locates requested items within a large storage room and delivers them to the front desk. There are 150 public computers throughout the building for electronic archive research. The library has group study rooms, writable walls, balconies, terraces, and a vegetative roof. At its entrance stands a 24-foot media wall, powered by three Microsoft Kinect units and integrated using a custom program that allows visitors to scroll through university news, browse pictures contributed from students, and learn about upcoming university events.

The $50 million library is part of a larger $500 million building and expansion plan announced by Liberty University.

==== National Civil War Chaplains Museum ====

The National Civil War Chaplains Museum contains exhibits about clergy members and religious activity during the Civil War era. It is the only museum in the nation devoted to this purpose. The mission of the museum is to &quot;educate the public about the role of chaplains, priests, and rabbis and religious organizations in the Civil War; to promote the continuing study of the many methods of dissemination of religious doctrine and moral teachings during the War; to preserve religious artifacts, and to present interpretive programs that show the influence of religion on the lives of political and military personnel.&quot; A 501(c)(3) organization, the museum exists within the Jerry Falwell Library.

The museum commemorates Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish chaplains (including African-American chaplains), and houses publications and artifacts from both the Union and Confederate militaries. There are several areas in the museum that are given special attention including:
* The role of the United States Christian Commission, which is the forerunner to today&#x27;s USO and Red Cross.
* &quot;The relationship of religion to political and military leaders, common soldiers, and the public in the North and South.&quot;

==== Carter Glass Mansion ====
The Carter Glass Mansion, also called Montview, is a house built in 1923 for Carter Glass, a newspaper publisher, U.S. senator, U.S. treasury secretary under President Woodrow Wilson, and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and President Pro Tempore of the Senate during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The -story house, which is flanked by slightly smaller ells, has walls of quartz fieldstone quarried from the property and a grey gambrel roof. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and Virginia Landmarks Register.

The estate was purchased by Liberty University in the late 1970s to be the headquarters of the university administration. It housed the main office of university founder Jerry Falwell, who died at his desk on May 15, 2007. Falwell and his wife were buried on the rear lawn of the mansion and a memorial to Falwell was placed there, overlooking the rest of the campus. The estate is now largely a tourist site, with Falwell&#x27;s office preserved in its 2007 condition and the upstairs section of the mansion converted to a bed and breakfast for Liberty University guests.

==== Center for Creation Studies and Creation Hall ====
According to its literature, the Center for Creation Studies aims to study the origin of the universe, the earth, life, and diversification of species, equipping students to contend for their faith in the creation account in Genesis using science, reason, and the Scriptures. Young Earth creationism asserts that the Earth was created by supernatural acts by God 6,000 to 10,000 years ago rather than the scientific consensus that it accreted more than 4.5 billion years ago.

David A. DeWittis is the director of the Center for Creation Studies.

Creation Hall, on the second floor of the Center for Natural Sciences, is &quot;dedicated to promoting young-Earth creation&quot;. Displays include replicas claimed to be of post-Flood humans and fossils allegedly buried during Noah&#x27;s flood.

The inaugural competitive swimming event held in the swimming pool was the 2018 TYR Junior National Cup in March 2018. In 2020, one of the diving platforms collapsed for an unknown reason. Problems with the Daktronics race-timing system led the school to replace it after just three years.

The university is governed by a 30-member board of trustees that includes Jonathan Falwell, the son and brother (respectively) of the two former university presidents. Unlike most other research universities, faculty (outside the law school) are not offered tenure, giving them less influence in governing the university than is common. Most teachers are adjunct labor. Faculty must inform school officials before they speak with the media.

== Student life ==
Liberty University is a conservative Evangelical college, which is reflected in its honor code and other policies. The university teaches creationism alongside the science of evolutionary biology. Its honor code, called the &quot;Liberty Way&quot;, emphasizes purity culture.

=== Safety ===
In 2017, the school invited Ray Rice, who had been videotaped beating his fiancée three years earlier, to give a lecture on domestic violence. In 2021, a dozen anonymous women sued the school, charging that it failed to curb domestic violence and sexual assault on campus. A 2021 ProPublica investigation found that &quot;an ethos of sexual purity, as embodied by the Liberty Way, has led to school officials discouraging, dismissing and even blaming female students who have tried to come forward with claims of sexual assault.&quot;

The school sought for years to conceal campus crime and safety statistics, according to a preliminary 2023 report by the U.S. Department of Education reviewed by the &quot;Washington Post.&quot; The report, whose findings may yet be appealed by the school, documents alleged violations of the Clery Act, which requires schools that receive federal money to disclose crime and safety statistics. Instead, the report indicates, university officials destroyed documentation and failed to notify the campus of sexual predators, bomb threats, and gas leaks. In March 2024 the U.S. Department of education fined the university $14 million for its treatment of sexual assault survivors and the misclassification or underreporting of crimes. Victims were afraid to report crimes for fear of reprisals or were punished for violating the student code by administrators.

=== Demographics ===

In fall 2017, the acceptance rate for new first-time, full-time students entering Liberty&#x27;s resident program was 30%. In 2011, the overall acceptance rate, which includes online students, was 51 percent. Liberty University Online is an open enrollment institution.

Liberty&#x27;s Black population has declined from 19.9 percent in 2011 to 10.4 percent in 2019, with a graduation rate of 17% among full-time Black students.

====On-campus demographics====

====Online demographics====
Including online students, Liberty&#x27;s undergraduate population in 2017 was 51% White, 26.5% race/ethnicity unknown, 15.4% Black or African American, 2.3% two or more races, 1.7% Hispanic/Latino, 1.4% non-resident alien, 0.9% Asian, 0.6% American Indian or Alaskan native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.

In terms of combined traditional and distance learning students, Liberty University is the 7th-largest four-year university, and the largest university in Virginia.

==== LGBTQ+ stance ====
Words and actions indicating &quot;LGBT states of mind&quot; are prohibited for students as of the 2021 version of &quot;The Liberty Way&quot;, the student handbook. Sexual relations are only permitted in a Biblically ordained marriage between a man and a woman. The student handbook says gay sex is prohibited by the Bible, and thus by the school. Kissing, holding hands, or dating a member of the same sex are also prohibited under &quot;The Liberty Way&quot;.

Students have criticized the university for being unwelcoming to LGBT students. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has reported that LGBTQ+ students hide their dating behavior in order to graduate and to avoid being fined. Campus Pride, an organization that advocates for LGBT rights on college campuses, listed Liberty University as one of the worst universities for LGBT students. The school offers conversion &quot;therapy&quot; to gay students, a practice that peer-reviewed studies have shown is ineffective and harmful.

In 2021, a former Liberty University student was part of a class action lawsuit filed against the U.S. Department of Education alleging that the institution should not be eligible to receive federal funding because of its discriminatory practices against LGBT students. In 2015, Liberty University denied the discounted tuition to same-sex and trans spouses of military personnel that it offered to heterosexual military couples. In 2016, the university ordered a version of a psychology textbook that omitted sections with LGBTQ+-focused content.

The school says it does not engage in unlawful discrimination or harassment because of race, color, ancestry, religion, age, sex, national origin, pregnancy or childbirth, disability or military veteran status. But it &quot;reserves its right to discriminate on the basis of religion to the extent that applicable law respects its right to act in furtherance of its religious objectives.&quot;

=== Honor code ===
The Liberty University honor code forbids students to be alone with a member of the opposite sex &quot;at an off-campus residence&quot; or to have premarital sex anywhere. Students may not consume alcohol or tobacco. In 2015, Liberty revised the code to allow students to watch R-rated movies and to play video games rated &quot;M&quot;. In 2017, the curfew policy was changed to permit students age 20 and over to sign out and stay out past curfew. In 2018, the administration rejected a resolution from the student government that would have allowed off-campus drinking, &quot;profane language&quot;, and the use of tobacco.

=== Convocation ===

Liberty&#x27;s convocation, held at the Vines Center on Wednesdays and Fridays, is the largest weekly gathering of Christian students in America.

Attendance is mandatory for residential undergraduate and graduate students and commuter students under 21 years of age. They must report to their assigned Resident Assistant and sit in their assigned section, though they may skip Convocation once per semester if they notify their Resident Assistant at least 24 hours in advance. They are fined $25 for each of their first two unexcused absences, and $50 for each subsequent absence.

Commuting students over 21 are encouraged to attend.

=== Clubs and organizations ===

According to Liberty&#x27;s website, there are over 100 registered on-campus clubs and organizations.

===&quot;Liberty Champion&quot;===
&quot;Liberty Champion&quot; is Liberty University&#x27;s official student newspaper.

In 2019, Will Young, a former editor of the &quot;Champion&quot;, recalled his experiences in a lengthy &quot;Washington Post&quot; article. In his first week in that role, he had been rebuked for attempting to get the campus&#x27;s police blotter. He found that school officials often overrode student editors&#x27; decisions and imposed censorship, which was part of &quot;an infrastructure of thought-control that Falwell and his lieutenants [had] introduced into every aspect of Liberty University life&quot;. Young wrote that when he eventually resigned, the school did not appoint a new student editor, opting instead to turn the newspaper &quot;into a faculty-run, student-written organ and seizing complete control of its content.&quot;

Student journalists became so frustrated that they launched an independent newspaper, the &quot;Lynchburg Torch&quot;, to cover stories the administration tried to suppress. It operated from 2017 to 2019.

=== Speech and debate ===
Liberty&#x27;s Inter-Collegiate policy debate program ranked first overall (i.e., combining the results at the varsity, junior varsity, and novice levels) for their division at the National Debate Tournament in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. In varsity rankings, Liberty finished 20th in 2005, 17th in 2006, 24th in 2007, 12th in 2008, 9th in 2009, 4th in 2010, and 4th in 2011. In 2017, the team finished atop the final rankings of all three national debate tournaments for the eighth time, sweeping the American Debate Association, the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA), and the National Debate Tournament (NDT). As of 2017, Liberty was the only school to finish first in all three in a single year. As well, it had placed first in the CEDA for eight straight years, first in the NDT for seven of those, and first in the ADA for 13 of the last 14.

Through 2016, Liberty hosted the Virginia High School League&#x27;s annual Debate State Championships each April. VHSL stopped holding debate competitions at the school after Chancellor Falwell said students should arm themselves to &quot;end those Muslims&quot; who committed the 2015 San Bernardino attack. League officials said they sought an &quot;environment free from harassment, personal threat, or physical or mental harm.&quot;

== Athletics ==
Liberty&#x27;s athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the Liberty Flames. Liberty is a member of the ASUN Conference for 17 of its 20 varsity sports. Women&#x27;s swimming competes in the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association, and women&#x27;s field hockey competes in the Big East Conference. The field hockey team had belonged to the Northern Pacific Field Hockey Conference before that league&#x27;s demise after the 2014 season. It competed as an independent in the 2015 season, then join the Big East Conference for the 2016 season. Starting in 2018, the football team began competing in the FBS as an independent. In 2020, Liberty entered the rankings in the AP Poll at 25 for the first time in program history. They finished the season being ranked 17 in the AP Poll and 18 in the Coaches Poll of top football teams in the country.

The university regularly competes for the Sasser Cup, the Big South&#x27;s trophy for the university that has the best sports program among the member institutions. Liberty has won the Sasser Cup ten times, the most in the Big South. In 2012, Liberty became the first Big South school to win five consecutive Sasser Cups.

=== Football ===
As of the 2023 season, the Liberty Flames compete in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as a member of Conference USA. The team used Lynchburg&#x27;s City Stadium as their home stadium until October 21, 1989, when the Flames played their first home game at Williams Stadium. The Flames won their first three bowl games: the Cure Bowl in 2019 and 2020 and the LendingTree Bowl in 2021. Since 2022, the Flames&#x27; head coach has been Jamey Chadwell. In 2023, the Flames went undefeated (12–0) in the regular season, the first Division-I team from Virginia to do so, and won the CUSA Championship Game. On January 1, 2024, they played in their first New Year&#x27;s 6 bowl, the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl, against the Pac-12 Oregon Ducks, losing 45–6.

=== Basketball ===

Liberty University&#x27;s basketball teams play most home games in the 4,000-seat Liberty Arena; some are moved to the 9,547-seat Vines Center. Several members of the men&#x27;s Liberty Flames have been recruited to the NBA. The women&#x27;s Liberty Lady Flames was honored by the Big South &quot;with the Top 25 &#x27;Best of the Best&#x27; moments in League history from 1983–2008; with Liberty University&#x27;s 10-year women&#x27;s basketball championship run from 1996–2007 was crowned the No. 1 moment in the Big South&#x27;s first 25 years.&quot;

In 2019, the men&#x27;s basketball program won the Atlantic Sun Conference basketball tournament and earned an automatic bid to the NCAA basketball tournament. Liberty earned its highest ranking ever when it was selected as the No. 12 seed in the East Region. Liberty set a school record with their 29th win as they upset Mississippi State 80–76 in the first round of the East Region in the 2019 NCAA tournament.

=== Baseball ===
The Liberty Baseball Stadium, completed in June 2013 and home to Liberty Baseball, was ranked No. 4 among college ballpark experiences by Stadium Journey website in 2015. The stadium includes 2,500 chairbacks, locker room, four indoor batting tunnels, four luxury suites, offices for the baseball program, a weight room, team room and a fully functional press area. Several Liberty Flames baseball players were drafted during the 2015 Major League Baseball draft. Local stations air some games. Some games have aired nationally on ESPNU.

=== Ice hockey ===

Liberty University has men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s club ice hockey teams. The women&#x27;s team has won six American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) D1 national championships (2015, 2018-2023) and is currently coached by Chris Lowes.

Men&#x27;s hockey started in 1985 when Liberty students organized a team to play surrounding colleges and clubs but has since become a competitive club team competing against much larger schools such as University of Oklahoma, University of Delaware, and Penn State University. In 2006, Liberty became the only Virginia school with a men&#x27;s ACHA Division I club hockey team; and opened the 3,000-seat LaHaye Ice Center, a gift of Timothy and Beverly LaHaye. The men&#x27;s Division I team is coached by Kirk Handy.

=== Cross country ===
Individual NCAA Division I champions include Josh McDougal (2007) and Samuel Chelanga (2009–2010). Chelanga took two gold medals and three silvers in outdoor and indoor competition in three years and won All-American honors 14 times.

== Subsidiaries ==

=== Liberty University Online ===
Liberty University has an Internet education component called Liberty University Online, also known as LU Online or LUO, which provides degrees from associate&#x27;s level to doctorate.Liberty University offers 100% online associate degrees and bachelor&#x27;s degrees, as well as certificates, in many areas of study.

Online students constitute the overwhelming majority of the university&#x27;s students and revenue, &quot;subsidizing the university&quot; and making them &quot;a killing&quot;, according to faculty members, despite the &quot;steep drop-off in quality from the traditional college to the online courses.&quot; Critics have argued that the online division subsidizes campus resources, such as the ski resort and gun range, and that online enrollment is run in a boiler room fashion. Online instructors are mainly engaged in answering emails and grading rather than creating and delivering content.

=== Liberty University Online Academy ===
Established in 2007, the Liberty University Online Academy (LUOA) is a K-12 private school serving about 18,000 students for academically talented students worldwide. It is accredited by SACS (Southern Association of Schools and Colleges). In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Liberty faculty acknowledge that courses taken via the lucrative Liberty University Online program are worse than the university&#x27;s traditional in-person classes.

=== Standing for Freedom Center ===
In November 2019, Liberty and Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA launched a think tank subsidiary called the Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty. The name was derived, in part, from the portmanteau combining the names of Jerry Falwell Jr. and Charlie Kirk, as well as Falwell&#x27;s affinity for the film Braveheart and the Battle of Falkirk, which was depicted in the film. The think tank hired Trump attorney Jenna Ellis and Trump surrogate Sebastian Gorka as fellows and paid for political Facebook ads promoting Trump and other Republican candidates during the 2020 election campaign.
In March 2021, the university renamed the organization the &quot;Standing for Freedom Center&quot;, having chosen not to renew Kirk&#x27;s contract several months earlier.
In November 2021, the Standing for Freedom Center hosted former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, author Eric Metaxas, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.

===Publications===
The &quot;Journal of Statesmanship and Public Policy&quot; explores topics in the realms of national security, international relations, domestic policy, and political philosophy from a deeply thoughtful, ethical, and Christian perspective.&quot; Recent articles have been published on strict constructionism and critical race theory.
The &quot;Liberty Bell News&quot; is an online publication whose mission is &quot;to maintain the vision of the founder, Dr. Jerry Falwell Sr., to develop and train Christ-centered men and women with the values, knowledge, and skills essential to impact the world.&quot;

== Finances, marketing, and recruitment ==
In June 2021, Liberty University had $3.94 billion in assets and $474 million in liabilities. Its operating revenue was $1.15 billion and its operating expenses were $840 million. Its endowment was valued at $1.71 billion in fiscal year 2021. In fiscal year 2020, Liberty University received $800 million from online tuition and $361 million from residential student tuition. According to Third Way, Liberty uses less than 20 percent of its revenues for instruction.

In its early years, the university was held afloat financially by major donors. In 1987, Liberty University&#x27;s 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status was formally recognized by the IRS.

In the 1990s, the debt-saddled university was placed on probation several times by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools because of heavy debt. In 1990, the university owed $110 million; in 1996, it owed $40 million. The Unification Church was an early donor. In 1994, the university received $3.5 million through Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Federation for World Peace. In 1996 News World Communications loaned $400,000 to Liberty.

In 2006, the university had net assets—cash, property, investments and other holdings—of roughly $100 million. At the start of Jerry Falwell Jr.&#x27;s presidency in 2007, the university listed $259 million in assets. Five years later, in May 2012, Falwell Jr. said the total had risen to $1 billion, thanks to proceeds from its online learning program and from accelerated facility expansion.

In December 2010, Liberty sold $120 million in facilities bonds to finance expansion. It sold an additional $100 million in taxable bonds in January 2012 to help finance $225.2 million of planned capital projects around the campus over the next five years. The bond offering was part of Liberty University&#x27;s campus transformation plan which included several renovations and additions to academic buildings and student housing, as well as fund the new Jerry Falwell Library and formation of a medical school. The bonds received a rating of &quot;AA&quot; from Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and in 2013 received an upgraded rating of &quot;Aa3&quot; along with a &quot;stable outlook&quot; projection from Moody&#x27;s Investors Services based on &quot;the increasing scope of the University&#x27;s activity&quot;, &quot;its large pool of financial reserves&quot;, &quot;uncommonly strong operating performance&quot;, and &quot;discipline around building and maintaining reserves&quot;.

In March 2017, Falwell Jr. said that the university&#x27;s endowment stood at more than $1 billion and gross assets are in excess of $2 billion. The U.S. Department of Education rated Liberty as having a &quot;perfect&quot; financial responsibility score.

According to a 2018 report by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, most of Liberty University&#x27;s revenue comes from taxpayer-funded sources.

In 2019, Falwell Jr. was accused of using the university for his family&#x27;s financial benefit. Staff members said the university has funneled tuition money into real estate investments that benefit friends and family of the Falwells, including a shopping mall owned by the university and managed by Falwell&#x27;s son Trey, a university vice president. Falwell responded to the accusations by asserting that the FBI would investigate a &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot; in which individuals stole university property and shared it with reporters in an effort to damage his reputation.

=== Marketing and recruitment practices ===
In 2018, ProPublica and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Liberty University students were sixth in terms of receiving federal aid for the year 2017. Most of Liberty University&#x27;s revenue came from taxpayer-funded sources. ProPublica/&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that each of the university&#x27;s 300 salespeople were pressured to enroll up to eight students per day. A division of 60 salespeople targeted members of the military specifically because they had greater access to federal tuition assistance. The university&#x27;s salespeople were instructed to make the university appear more affordable by describing the tuition costs per credits rather than per course. The salespeople were also instructed to not inform potential students of the Christian orientation of the education; the first classes include three required Bible-studies classes. The credits for the Bible-studies classes are usually not transferable to other universities, which disincentivizes students from leaving Liberty University for other universities. According to a former employee, the university accepts any student with a grade point average above 0.5 (equivalent to a D-minus).

=== Sponsorships ===
Liberty University has sponsored NASCAR driver William Byron, also a LU student, since 2014 in a late model program run by Dale Earnhardt Jr.&#x27;s JR Motorsports. Liberty is in the midst of a deal with Byron and NASCAR Cup Series team Hendrick Motorsports that runs through 2026.

=== Federal funding ===
In 2019, Liberty University reportedly received about $700 million in federal funding.

=== Student loans and defaults ===
Liberty University students have a lower default rate compared to the national average of graduates from all schools. However, Liberty University students have a higher rate of defaults within three years of completing their studies compared to graduates of other private, non-profit, four-year colleges. Liberty University spends far less on instruction than traditional private universities, for-profit colleges and other nonprofit religious colleges.

In connection with being named to a Trump administration task force on deregulating higher education, university president Falwell alluded, as an example of regulatory overreach and &quot;micromanagement&quot;, to Obama-era regulations that govern student loan forgiveness for students who have been cheated by fraudulent colleges.

== Politics ==

=== Influence ===

Liberty University has been described as a &quot;stage of choice in Republican presidential politics&quot;, and a &quot;pilgrimage site for GOP candidates.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Republican candidates are drawn to the university because it is viewed as a &quot;bastion of the Christian right&quot;. Ronald Reagan&#x27;s close relationship with the university gave it significant publicity in its early years. In 1990, 41st U.S president George H. W. Bush was the first sitting U.S. president to speak at Liberty&#x27;s commencement. In 1996, U.S. Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas gave the commencement address at Liberty University.

Republican leaders Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, and John McCain have visited the campus. Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson spoke at the university. In 2017, President Donald Trump gave his first college commencement speech as sitting president at Liberty University. In 2019, Vice President Mike Pence gave the school&#x27;s commencement address. Liberty was a satellite location for CPAC 2019, hosting numerous conservative speakers on-campus.

In 2009, LU stopped recognizing LU&#x27;s Democratic Party student group; school officials said this was because the Democratic Party platform goes against the school&#x27;s conservative Christian principles. Democrats such as Ted Kennedy, Bernie Sanders, and Jesse Jackson have spoken there. In 2018, former 39th U.S. president Jimmy Carter gave the commencement speech. However, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton have rejected invitations to speak at LU.

In 2021, Interim President Jerry Prevo told Scott Lamb, then the university&#x27;s senior vice president for communications and public engagement, that he wanted the school to become &quot;a more effective political player by helping to influence elections.&quot; Prevo said getting conservative candidates elected was &quot;one of our main goals&quot;. &quot;Politico&quot; wrote that his comments &quot;raise new questions about the blurred line between education and politics at the university, which as a 501(c)(3) charity is not supposed to participate directly in political campaigns&quot;.

=== 2015 concealed handguns remarks ===
In a December 5, 2015, convocation speech, President Jerry Falwell Jr. encouraged the student body to obtain concealed handgun permits. Falwell discussed the attack in San Bernardino and said, &quot;If more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in.&quot; This was met with public condemnation for singling out the Muslim religion rather than the attack itself. Governor Terry McAuliffe called the statement &quot;repugnant&quot;. Falwell later said he was referring to the Muslim shooters in the San Bernardino attack, not all Muslims.

=== Links to Donald Trump ===
The school is noted for its official embrace of Donald Trump before and during his term as U.S. president. The businessman twice spoke at the university Convocation: in 2012, when he was awarded an honorary doctor of business degree, and in 2016. As U.S. president, Trump was the keynote speaker at the May 2017 commencement, when he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Falwell Jr. commended Trump for &quot;bombing those in the Middle East who persecute and kill Christians,&quot; and that Trump had &quot;proved that he is a man of his word.&quot; As of 2022, three honorary degrees Trump received from other institutions have been rescinded, but Liberty has not rescinded the two it granted Trump.

Falwell Jr.&#x27;s uncritical support for Trump was characterized as a repudiation of Christian values.

Various school officials and students criticized this support and the university&#x27;s ties with Trump. Among them was Mark DeMoss, Falwell&#x27;s chief of staff, who was forced to resign from Liberty&#x27;s board of trustees. Another was Liberty alumnus Jonathan Merritt, whose invitation to speak on campus was rescinded. Still another was Christian author Jonathan Martin, who was expelled from campus.

The school reportedly censored articles critical of Trump in the student newspaper. In 2016, a student editor said that Falwell had censored an opinion column that criticized Trump for his lewd comments caught on an &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape. Other articles in the student newspaper which mentioned Trump were reportedly spiked by faculty members. In 2018, two student editors were fired, reportedly for running articles critical of Trump; one of the student editors lost a $3,000-a-semester scholarship. In 2019, this censorship and other factors led the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education to rank Liberty University among the worst universities in terms of free speech.

In 2017, some students protested after President Trump criticized both white supremacists and counter-protesters at the August Charlottesville rally where three people died and 33 were injured. Following Trump&#x27;s remarks, Falwell said that he was &quot;so proud&quot; of Trump for his &quot;bold truthful&quot; statement on the tragedy. A number of alumni returned their diplomas to Liberty University and called on the university to disavow Trump&#x27;s remarks. The graduates argued that Trump&#x27;s remarks were &quot;incompatible with Liberty University&#x27;s stated values, and incompatible with a Christian witness.&quot;

In 2018, some Liberty students went to Washington, D.C., to support President Trump&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. That same year, students at the university gave a standing ovation to First Lady of the United States Melania Trump, along with several Trump cabinet officials who spoke at the university during a town hall about the drug epidemic.

In spring 2018, Liberty&#x27;s Zaki Gordon Cinematic Arts Center co-produced a feature film called &quot;The Trump Prophecy&quot;. The film focuses on a retired firefighter from Florida who says God revealed to him in 2011 that Trump would one day be president. The film was shown in some cinemas in October 2018.

In 2019, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Inside Higher Education&quot; reported that Liberty CIO John Gauger allegedly accepted cash, through his IT consulting firm unaffiliated with the school, to rig two online polls for Trump before he became a candidate.

== Controversies ==

In 2019, Will E. Young, a former editor-in-chief of Liberty&#x27;s &quot;Champion&quot; student newspaper, described the &quot;culture of fear&quot; at Liberty University, noting that the school &quot;founded on principles of fundamental Christianity, is now a place that has zero tolerance for new questions and ideas. Those who harbor them must remain silent, or leave.&quot; Young later argued that Liberty must address its racist past, beginning with Jerry Falwell Sr. and that it must include people of color and LGBTQ people as it makes decisions.

In spring 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Liberty allowed some students to return to campus after spring break over the objections of the city&#x27;s mayor and contrary to the practices of most U.S. colleges and universities. When a ProPublica reporter and &quot;The New York Times&quot; photographer investigated why the university remained partially open, the university pushed the local district attorney to charge them with trespassing.

A few months later, then-president Falwell Jr. posted a picture of Virginia&#x27;s then-governor Ralph Northam&#x27;s black face in a tweet that many found racist. Some staff resigned in protest; some black students pursued transfers, many contending that the tweet was a symptom of a larger problem at the university. In response to internal and external criticism, Liberty University officials hired Kelvin Edwards, an alumnus and former NFL player, to lead diversity initiatives on campus, then fired him three months later. Edwards sued the university, alleging a breach of contract.

In July 2024, Liberty was sued for $300,000 by Ellenor Zinski, whose lawsuit alleges that the university violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it fired Zinski, who is transgender, since the university explicitly cited Zinski&#x27;s gender as the reason for her firing. Liberty University contends that Zinski&#x27;s contract was violated by knowingly breaking LU&#x27;s policies that are based in their religious beliefs and thus protected by the Constitution. Liberty University&#x27;s doctrinal statement lists &quot;denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender&quot; is an example of &quot;sinful acts prohibited by God.&quot;

===Falwell Jr. scandals===

Falwell Jr. was placed on indefinite leave on August 7, 2020, after media began reporting allegations, including photographs, of personal and professional impropriety. A few weeks later, he resigned. He claimed that he was entitled to $10.5 million in compensation from the university because he resigned without either admitting to wrongdoing or having formal accusations opened against him.

At the end of Falwell Jr.&#x27;s presidency in 2020, the university listed over $2.5 billion in assets. Following Falwell&#x27;s resignation, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; reported that Liberty University was &quot;facing growing criticism over perceived resistance to diversity&quot; following the departures of Edwards, board chair Allen McFarland, and pastor David Nasser. Jonathan Falwell, a son of Jerry Falwell Sr., replaced Nasser.

In late 2020, three reform efforts took place. A group of Liberty University alumni called Save71 was organized in an effort to reform the school. Three Liberty University athletes, Kennedi Williams, Dee Brown, and TreShaun Clark, organized a Black Lives Matter protest on campus, drawing a crowd of about two hundred people. Student leaders also created an online petition to force Liberty to shut down the school&#x27;s think tank, the Falkirk Center, named after Jerry Falwell Jr. and conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The petition garnered about 400 signatures.

In 2020, the university&#x27;s former president Jerry Falwell Jr. was accused of nepotism, racism, and alcohol use contravening Baptist teaching on teetotalism. Falwell and his wife Rebecca were involved in a number of sex scandals. These eventually led to his resignation on August 24, 2020. The following year, the university sued Falwell Jr. for $40 million in damages for breach of contract and violation of fiduciary duty. In the same month, the Liberty University board of trustees replaced acting chairman Allen McFarland, the first African American board chair, with Tim Lee, &quot;a pro-Trump pastor&quot;.

=== Poor management of sexual assault ===
In July 2021, the university was sued by twelve anonymous women, including two employees, who alleged that the university created an environment that increased the likelihood of sexual assault and rape in violation of federal Title IX law. The lawsuit alleged that the school&#x27;s student honor code makes it difficult to report sexual violence because it does not clearly shield students; that the university had a tacit policy that condoned sexual violence, especially by male student athletes, by weighing a denial more heavily than an allegation; and that the school retaliates against women who report sexual violence. In one of the alleged incidents, a 15-year-old who was allegedly attacked by Jesse Matthew (Matthew later confessed to murdering Hannah Graham), was told she would be criminally charged with filing a false report, before they began an &quot;investigation&quot; into her claim. The investigation allegedly only consisted of a demand that she strip and submit to being photographed naked by the chief of police—which she refused to do. She later was not taken to the hospital but the police later pestered her until she agreed to be photographed naked by a female debate coach. In a written response to the lawsuit, Liberty University officials said &quot;The allegations are deeply troubling, if they turn out to be true&quot;, and said that would look into each allegation detailed in the lawsuit. Ten of the women settled in a confidential agreement.

Also in July 2021, Liberty University diversity retention officer LeeQuan McLaurin, a black gay man, filed a discrimination lawsuit against the school, claiming that his supervisor&#x27;s view that Christianity condemns homosexuality forced him to quit.

An October 2021, a &quot;ProPublica&quot; investigative report found that Liberty University discouraged and dismissed students coming forward about sexual assault; former students said they were threatened with punishment after coming forward with accusations of sexual assault. Multiple witnesses said school officials manipulated their statements in support of a sexual assault victims to undercut the victims&#x27; accounts, eventually expelling one such witness. Additionally, the school neglected to report every case to the Title IX office or to inform students of their option of reporting incidents to law enforcement. Sexual assault victims shared accounts of university staff erroneously telling them that speaking to law enforcement would compromise a Title IX investigation and of being made to sign documents agreeing not to report their sexual assault to the police. According to a Liberty alumna who spoke to &quot;ProPublica&quot;, after she reported her rape to the university&#x27;s Title IX office, a school official listed the potential infractions she could be disciplined for in the incident, including having premarital sex. &quot;Politico&quot; also reported that a former Liberty University official, Scott Lamb, also accused Liberty University of violating its 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. &quot;Politico&quot; had previously reported that the school had invested in &quot;Republican causes and efforts to promote the Trump administration&quot;. Lamb told &quot;ProPublica&quot; that he was fired on October 6, 2021, for telling school officials about staff members&#x27; failure to report sexual assaults appropriately. He characterized the tendency of university leaders to ignore sexual assault reports once they made their way up the chain of command as &quot;a conspiracy of silence&quot;.

In fall 2021, an outbreak of COVID-19 forced all classes on the Lynchburg campus to go online-only for two weeks. More than 400 students and 50 staff members tested positive for the virus. The campus did not require COVID-19 vaccinations, masks, or social distancing. Outdoor events, including a convocation and football game, were scheduled to continue.

In fall 2023, a preliminary report by the U.S. Department of Education alleged that school officials had failed to report campus crime and safety statistics, had destroyed evidence of assaults, and had retaliated against at least one employee who raised concerns about violations of the Clery Act, the federal law that requires such disclosures by schools that receive federal funding. Crimes the report finds were covered up include sexual assault, stalking, and intimate partner violence. Specific acts by Liberty employees detailed in the report include tasking IT with wiping specific hard drives, failing to secure and potentially shredding incident reports, failing to log or follow up on a police report alleging a rape by an unnamed former university president, re-promoting an employee who was demoted after accusations of drugging and assaulting a colleague, and allowing a football player to remain on the team from 2018 to 2022 despite accusations of rape and of stalking a university employee during that time. The report states that the university&#x27;s culture of &quot;substantially and systematically underreported&quot; crime statistics might trace back as far to 1992. Liberty faces a fine of up to $37.5 million for Clery Act violations. An alumna who says Liberty pressured her to retract a report of sexual assault told &quot;USA Today&quot; of potential fines, &quot;A little fine is not going to make them change their ways. They can make back any amount of money with a snap of fingers&quot;.

In March 2024, Liberty University was fined $14 million for the Clery Act violations. As described by &quot;NPR&quot;, the investigators&#x27; final 105-page report documents &quot;serious, persistent, and systemic violations&quot; by officials who &quot;discouraged students from reporting crimes, did not adequately respond to incidents of sexual violence, failed to tell the campus about criminal activities or dangerous situations (such as gas leaks), and did not maintain an accurate or complete list of crimes&quot;.

<text>John Chalkhill (fl. 1600?) was an English poet.

Two songs by him are included in Izaak Walton&#x27;s &quot;Compleat Angler&quot;, and in 1683 appeared &quot;Thealma and Clearchus. A Pastoral History in smooth and easie Verse. Written long since by John Chalkhill, Esq., an Acquaintant and Friend of Edmund Spencer&quot; (1683), with a preface written five years earlier by Walton.

Another poem, &quot;Aldilia, Philoparthens Loving Follie&quot; (1595, reprinted in vol. X of the &quot;Jahrbuch des deutschen Shakespeare-Vereins&quot;), was at one time attributed to him. Nothing further is known of the poet, but a person with the same name is recorded as one of the coroners for Middlesex in the later years of Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign.

George Saintsbury, who included &quot;Thealma and Clearchus&quot; in vol. II of his &quot;Minor Poets of the Caroline Period&quot; (Oxford, 1906), points out a marked resemblance between Chalkhill&#x27;s work and that of William Chamberlayne.

<text>William Chamberlayne (1619 – 11 July 1679 or 1689) was an English poet.

Nothing is known of his history except that he practised as a physician at Shaftesbury in Dorset and fought on the Royalist side at the Second Battle of Newbury.

His works are:
*&quot;Pharonnida&quot; (1659), a verse romance in five books
*&quot;Love&#x27;s Victory&quot; (1658), a tragi-comedy, acted under another title in 1678 at the Theatre Royal 
*&quot;England&#x27;s Jubilee&quot; (1660), a poem in honour of the Restoration
A prose version of &quot;Pharonnida&quot;, entitled &quot;Eromena, or the Noble Stranger&quot;, appeared in 1683.

In 1677 his play &quot;Wits Led by the Nose&quot;, a comedy, was staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane by the King&#x27;s Company.

Robert Southey speaks of him as &quot;a poet to whom I am indebted for many hours of delight.&quot; &quot;Pharonnida&quot; was reprinted by S. W. Singer in 1820 and again in 1905 by George Saintsbury in &quot;Minor Poets of the Caroline Period&quot; (vol. i). The poem is loose in construction but contains some passages of great beauty.

<text>Altered Space: A 3-D Alien Adventure is a 1991 video game produced for the Nintendo Game Boy.

==Gameplay==
The player is an astronaut named Humphrey trapped on a spaceship of an alien race known as the Zaks. In addition to avoiding the Zaks, the player must also avoid wardenlike spherical creatures known as Garffs. Humphrey cannot breathe the Zaks&#x27; air, so he needs to constantly replenish his own oxygen supply. The Zaks will take half of Humphrey&#x27;s air should they capture him and send him to a detaining point to be reset like a checkpoint. The object of the game is for Humphrey to reach his own impounded spacecraft and flee back to Earth.

This was the first isometric view game on the Game Boy.

<doc id="456386" wikidata="Q31534" url="?curid=456386" title="History of Hawaii">
<text>The history of Hawaii began with the discovery and settlement of the Hawaiian Islands by Polynesian people between 940 and 1200 AD. 

The first recorded and sustained contact with Europeans occurred by chance when British explorer James Cook sighted the islands in January 1778 during his third voyage of exploration. Aided by European military technology, Kamehameha I conquered and unified the islands for the first time, establishing the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1795. The kingdom became prosperous and important for its agriculture and strategic location in the Pacific.

American immigration, led by Protestant missionaries, and Native Hawaiian emigration, mostly on whaling ships but also in high numbers as indentured servants and as forced labor, began almost immediately after Cook&#x27;s arrival. Americans established plantations to grow crops for export. Their farming methods required substantial labor. Waves of permanent immigrants came from Japan, China, and the Philippines to labor in the cane and pineapple fields. The government of Japan organized and gave special protection to its people, who comprised about 25 percent of the Hawaiian population by 1896. The Hawaiian monarchy encouraged this multi-ethnic society, initially establishing a constitutional monarchy in 1840 that promised equal voting rights regardless of race, gender, or wealth.

The population of Native Hawaiians declined precipitously from an unknown number prior to 1778 (estimated to be around 300,000). It fell to around 142,000 in the 1820s based on a census conducted by American missionaries, 82,203 in the 1850 Hawaiian Kingdom census, 40,622 in the final Hawaiian Kingdom census of 1890, 39,504 in the sole census by the Republic of Hawaii in 1896, and 37,656 in the first census conducted by the United States in 1900. Thereafter the Native Hawaiian population in Hawaii increased with every census, reaching 680,442 in 2020 (including people of mixed heritage).

In 1893 Queen Liliʻuokalani was illegally deposed and placed under house arrest by businessmen (who included members of the Dole family) with help from the U.S. Marines. The Republic of Hawaii governed for a short time until Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1898 as the Territory of Hawaii. In 1959, the islands became the 50th American state.

== Ancient Hawaii==
===Discovery and settlement===

The date of the first settlements is a continuing debate. Kirch&#x27;s textbooks on Hawaiian archeology date the first Polynesian settlements to about 300, although his more recent estimates are as late as 600. Other theories suggest dates as late as 700 to 800. The most recent survey of carbon-dating evidence puts the arrival of the first settlers at around 940–1130.

The history of the ancient Polynesians was passed down through genealogy chants recited at formal and family functions. The high chiefs&#x27; genealogy traced back to the period believed to be inhabited only by gods. The &quot;pua aliʻi&quot; (&quot;flower of royalty&quot;) were considered to be living gods.

Tahitian priest Pā‘ao is said to have brought a new order around 1200. It included laws and a social structure that separated the people into classes. The &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; was the king, with his &quot;ʻaha kuhina&quot; just below them. The &quot;aliʻi&quot; were the royal nobles with the &quot;kahuna&quot; (high priest) below them, the &quot;makaʻāinana&quot; (commoners) next with the &quot;kauā&quot; as the lowest class.

The rulers (&quot;noho aliʻi o ko Hawaiʻi Pae ʻAina&quot;) were independent rulers of geographic areas. Their genealogy traces to Hānalaʻanui and others. The &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; were responsible for making sure that people observed a strict &quot;kapu&quot; (code of conduct). The system governed many aspects of Hawaiian social order, fishing rights and even where women could eat.

Regular voyages occurred between Tahiti and Hawaii for some time, but stoped around 1300 AD. Hawaii was thus isolated from the rest of the world for several centuries, until 1778 when Captain Cook made the first documented contact between Hawaii and European explorers.(better source needed)

The group of islands did not have a single name, and each island was ruled separately. The names of the islands recorded by Captain Cook reflect this fact. Kamehameha I, as ruler of the island of Hawaii, imposed the name &quot;Hawaiʻi&quot; on the whole island group when he unified them as the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi.

===Religion===
Individuals who were ungodly, godless, irreligious, wicked, unbelieving, or careless of observance of taboos, were known as &quot;ʻaiā&quot;. However, the dominant religion as in many other Polynesian societies, was the kapu/taboo religion. It had a theology, ritual, and a code of conduct. It included many gods and heroes that people worshiped in different ways. In one tradition, Wākea, the Sky Father, wed Papahānaumoku, the Earth Mother and from their union came all Hawaiians, including the other gods. In traditional Pu-anue genealogy, Kumukumu-ke-kaa and her husband Paia-a-ka-lani were the mother and father of the earth and heavens. Another genealogy declared that Ka-mai-eli and Kumu-honua were the mother and father.

The kapu religion in Hawaii was polytheistic, led by the gods Kāne, Kū, Lono, and Kanaloa. Other notable deities included Laka, Kihawahine, Haumea, Papahānaumoku, and, most famously, Pele. Each Hawaiian family is considered to have one or more guardian spirits or family gods known as ʻaumakua. One such god is Iolani, the god of &quot;alii&quot;.

One breakdown of the Kapu pantheon noted the following groups:
* four major gods (&quot;ka hā) –&quot; Kū, Kāne, Lono, Kanaloa
* forty male gods or aspects of Kāne (&quot;ke kanahā&quot;)
* four hundred gods and goddesses (&quot;ka lau&quot;)
* a multitude of gods and goddesses (&quot;ke kini akua&quot;)
* spirits (&quot;na unihipili&quot;)
* guardians (&quot;na aumākua&quot;)
Another breakdown consists of three major groups:
* four gods, or &quot;akua&quot;: Kū, Kāne, Lono, Kanaloa
* many lesser gods, or &quot;kupua&quot;, each associated with certain professions
* guardian spirits, &quot;aumakua&quot;, associated with particular families

===Rulers of Hawaii island===

==== Līloa ====
Līloa was a legendary ruler of the island of Hawaii in the late 15th century. His royal compound was in Waipiʻo Valley. His line traces to Hawaiian creation.

Līloa had two sons; his firstborn Hākau from his wife/aunt Pinea, (his mother&#x27;s sister), and his second son, ʻUmi a Līloa from his lesser wife, Akahi a Kuleana. Upon his death, Hākau became ruler and delegated religious authority to ʻUmi. Akahi a Kuleana was of a lesser line of chiefs who Līloa had fallen in love with when he discovered her bathing in a river. The couple met when Līloa was visiting Hamakua. He asserted his right to her as King and she accepted.

Līloa&#x27;s Kāʻei is his sacred feathered sash, now kept at the Bishop Museum.

Līloa was the first son of Kiha nui lulu moku who descended from Hāna laʻa nui. Līloa&#x27;s mother, Waioloa, his grandmother, Neʻula and great-grandmother, Laʻa kapu were of the ʻEwa aliʻi lines of Oahu. Līloa&#x27;s father ruled Hawaii as &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; and upon his death elevated Līloa. Kiha had had four other sons, Kaunuamoa, Makaoku, Kepailiula and Hoolana, whose descendants are the Kaiakea family of Molokai, distant relatives of Abraham Fornander&#x27;s daughter.

==== Hākau ====
Just before his death, Līloa elevated Hākau as Chief, telling Umi that he was to serve as his &quot;man&quot; (Prime Minister) and that each was to respect the other and should either have issue with the other it would be for them to decide. At first a decent king, Hākau soon became brutal. To avoid his brother&#x27;s anger, &#x27;Umi exiled himself to another district.

Hākau refused to help Nunu and Ka-hohe, his father&#x27;s two favorites, ailing &quot;Kahuna&quot; who had requested food. This was considered highly insulting. The two were of Lono&#x27;s priestly class. They resented their treatment and plotted to see the kingdom in someone else&#x27;s hand. Hākau did not believe the priests to have any power and showed them no respect as &#x27;Umi was the spiritual authority. In this period no King could defy a Kahuna. Many had a royal bloodline, land and could leave their temples as warriors when needed, but could never relinquish their spiritual responsibilities. Through a messenger of Kaoleioku, of Waipunalei, the high-priest of the temple of Manini, the two priests contacted Umi&#x27;s court at Koholalele. The two priests traveled to Waipunalei where they supported Umi&#x27;s revolt.

When Hākau received news that his brother was preparing to war against him, he sent his main forces to prepare by seeking feathers to adorn their regalia. After the warriors had left and Hākau was undefended, Umi&#x27;s warriors came forward claiming that they bore offerings for the king. They dropped the bundles and used the rocks within to stone Hākau to death.

==== ʻUmi-a-Līloa ====
ʻUmi-a-Līloa was a ruling &quot;aliʻi ai moku&quot; (district high chief of Hawai&#x27;i). He became chief after his half brother&#x27;s death and was considered a just ruler, religious and the first to unite most of the Hawaii Island. The legend of ʻUmi-a-Līloa is one of Hawaii&#x27;s most popular hero sagas.

ʻUmi&#x27;s wife was Princess Piʻikea, daughter of Piʻilani. They had one son, Kumalae and one daughter, Aihākōkō.

Līloa told Akahi that, if she were to have a male child, she should present the boy to him along with royal tokens he gave her as gifts, to prove her boy was the son of the king. Akahi hid the tokens from her husband and later gave birth to a son. At the age of 15 or 16, his stepfather was punishing the boy when his mother intervened and told the man not to touch him because the boy was his lord and chief. She uncovered the tokens to present to her husband to prove the high treason he would have committed. Akahi gave her son the royal malo and lei niho palaoa given to her by &#x27;Umi&#x27;s biological father. Only high chiefs wore these items. She sent &#x27;Umi to Waipiʻo Valley to present himself to the king as his son.

Līloa&#x27;s palace was guarded and attended by several Kahuna. The entire enclosure was sacred. Entering without permission carried the death penalty. &#x27;Umi entered the enclosure with attendants afraid to stop someone wearing the royal insignia and walked straight to Līloa&#x27;s sleeping quarters, waking him there. When Līloa asked who he was, he said &quot;It is I, &#x27;Umi your son&quot;. He then placed tokens at his father&#x27;s feet and Līloa proclaimed him to be his son. After learning of &#x27;Umi, Hākau became upset. Līloa assured his first born that he would be king after his death and that his brother would serve him. &#x27;Umi was brought to court on an equal footing with Hākau. &#x27;Umi found great favor from his father, increasing Hākau&#x27;s dislike.

In exile, &#x27;Umi took wives and began building forces and followers. Chiefs began to see him as of the highest chiefly nature from signs they observed. He gave food to people and became known for caring for all.

After Hākau&#x27;s death the other &quot;aliʻi&quot; claimed their districts for themselves. &#x27;Umi took the advice of the two priests by marrying many women of high noble rank, including his half sister Kapukini and the daughter of the ruler of Hilo, where he had been given sanctuary during Hākau&#x27;s reign. Eventually &#x27;Umi conquered the entire island.

After unifying the island of Hawaii, &#x27;Umi was faithful to those who had supported him, and allowed his three most faithful companions, and the two &quot;Kahuna&quot; who had aided him, to help him govern.

=== &quot;Aikāne&quot; ===
&quot;Aikāne&quot; relationships or (mostly male) homosexual or bisexual activity in the pre-colonial era was an accepted tradition. These relationships were accepted as part of Hawaiian culture. Such sexual relationships may have begun as teenagers and continued thereafter, even though they also had heterosexual partners. Cook and his associates provided extensive eyewitness accounts and analyses of such young men. These Aikane men were connected to chiefs whose functions were sexual, social, and political. The Hawaiian &quot;aikāne&quot; relationship was a part of Hawaiian noble life, including that of Kamehameha I. Some myths refer to women&#x27;s desires and therefore some women may have been involved in &quot;aikāne&quot; relationships. Līloa originated this practice among the &quot;alii,&quot; which was then copied by the other classes. Warriors engaged in the practice. In many cases, the men involved felt it an honor and responsibility to honor their &quot;hana lawelawe&quot;.

Lieutenant James King stated that &quot;all the chiefs had them&quot; and recounted a tale that Cook was asked by one chief to leave King behind, as a great honor. American adventurer and sailor John Ledyard commented in detail about the tradition.

=== Land division system ===

Land was divided in accord with the wishes of the &quot;Ali‘i Nui&quot;. The system had four hierarchical levels:
*&quot;mokupuni&quot; (island)
*&quot;moku&quot; (subdivision of an island)
*&quot;ahupuaʻa (&quot;subdivision of &quot;moku&quot;)
*&quot;ʻili&quot; (two or three per ahupuaʻa, but Kahoolawe for example had eight)
Some oral history relates that ʻUmi a Līloa created the &quot;ahupuaʻa&quot; system.

Each ahupuaʻa included a lowland &quot;mala&quot; and upland forested region. The divisions typically went from the ridge top to the coast, often following the boundary of a stream. Ahupuaʻa varied in size depending on the economic means of the location and political divisions of the area. The system exploited the fact that communities were organized along stream systems. The community governance system of Kānāwai is attributed specifically to shared water usage.

Each &quot;ahupuaʻa&quot; was divided into &quot;ʻili&quot; that in turn were divided into &quot;kuleana,&quot; individual plots of land that were cultivated by commoners who paid taxes to the land overseer each week. These taxes went to support the chief. Possible reasons for this radial division include:
*travel: in many areas, it is easier to travel up- and downstream than from valley to valley.
*economy: having all climate and economic exploitation zones in each land division ensured that each could be self-sufficient for much of its needs.
&quot;As the native Hawaiians used the resources within their ahupuaʻa, they practiced &quot;aloha&quot; (respect), &quot;laulima&quot; (cooperation) and &quot;malama&quot; (stewardship), which resulted in a desirable &quot;pono&quot; (balance)&quot;. The Hawaiians believed that the land, the sea, the clouds and all of nature were interconnected, which is why they used these resources to reach the desired balance in life. Sustainability was maintained by the &quot;konohiki&quot; and &quot;kahuna&quot; (priests who restricted the fishing of certain species during specific seasons). They also regulated the gathering of plants.

&quot;Ahupuaʻa&quot; is derived from the Hawaiian words &quot;ahu&quot; (heap, cairn) and &quot;puaʻa&quot; (pig). &quot;Ahupuaʻa&quot; boundary markers were traditionally heaps of stones used to hold offers (typically a pig) to the island chief.

=== Agriculture ===

The Hawaiian agricultural system used both irrigated and rain-fed (dryland) systems. Irrigated systems mainly supported taro (&quot;kalo&quot;) cultivation. Rain-fed systems were known as the &quot;mala.&quot; There they cultivated &quot;uala&quot; (sweet potatoes), yams, and dryland taro along with &quot;niu&quot; (coconuts), &quot;ʻulu (breadfruit&quot;), &quot;maiʻa (&quot;bananas) and &quot;ko&quot; (sugarcane). The &quot;kukui&quot; tree (&quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot;) was sometimes used as shade to protect &quot;mala&quot;. Each crop was cultivated in an area most suitable to its needs.

Hawaiians domesticated dogs, chickens, and pigs. They grew personal gardens at home. Water was important to Hawaiian life; it was used for fishing, bathing, drinking, and gardening, and for &quot;loko i&#x27;a&quot; (fishpond aquaculture systems).

====Governance====

The Kingdom was administered by an ali&#x27;i chief. Divisions were under the control of other smaller chiefs and managed by a steward. The headman of a land division or ahupua`a is a &quot;konohiki&quot;. &quot;Mokus&quot; were ruled by an &quot;aliʻi ʻaimoku&quot;. &quot;Ahupua&#x27;as were&quot; run by a headman or chief called a Konohiki.

=== &quot;Konohiki&quot; ===

In the Keelikolani vs Robinson court case, &quot;kononiki&quot; is defined as land agent. In the Territory vs Bishop Trust Co. LTD. case, when the agent was appointed by a chief, they were referred to as &quot;konohiki&quot;. The term also referred to a designated area of land owned privately (not by the government). A &quot;konohiki&quot; retained life tenure on the land even when discharged from the position, but a head man overseeing the same land had no such protection.

Often &quot;ali&#x27;i&quot; and &quot;konohiki&quot; are treated synonymously. However, while most &quot;konohiki&quot; were &quot;ali&#x27;i&quot;, not all &quot;ali&#x27;i&quot; were &quot;konohiki&quot;. A &quot;konohiki&quot; could also be a headman of a land division or to describe fishing rights. &quot;Kono&quot; means to entice or prompt. &quot;Hiki&quot; refers to something that can be done. The oversaw the property, managing water rights, land distribution, agricultural use and any maintenance. &quot;Konohiki&quot; also ensured that the right amounts of gifts and tribute were properly made at the right times.

As capitalism was incorporated into the kingdom, &quot;konohiki&quot; became tax collectors, landlords, and fishery wardens.

=== End of &quot;Kapu&quot; ===
Hawaiians overthrew the &quot;kapu&quot; theocracy in 1819 by themselves, before the missionaries&#x27; arrival. On October 4, 1819, Kamehameha II, dined with Queen Ka&#x27;ahumanu, Kamehameha I&#x27;s favored wife, and his own mother, Queen Keopuolani. The prohibition on men and women eating together, the &quot;‘ai kapu&quot;, was one of the most ancient &quot;kapu&quot; or prohibitions: the penalty for its violation was death. Queen Ka‘ahumanu, however, despised the prohibition as it prevented her from entering certain religious temples where men made decisions over meals. Queen Keopuolani also violated the prohibition even before the public breaking. Violating &quot;‘ai kapu&quot; at a public dinner, as Kamehameha II did, was a clear signal that the &quot;kapu&quot; system was abolished. The guests at the dinner cried out &quot;ai noa!&quot; (free eating). Afterwards, Kamehameha II – with the support of his high priest Hewahewa – ordered the destruction of the &quot;heiau&quot; temples. Afterwards, Kamehameha I&#x27;s nephew, Kekuaokalani launched a brief civil war. His forces were defeated by Kamehameha II&#x27;s at Kuamo‘o, reinforcing the new way.

==Contact==
&lt;section begin=Pre1778 /&gt;
===Possible European contact before 1778===

From 1565 to 1815, Spanish trading ships, or galleons, crossed the Pacific along a route from Acapulco in New Spain (modern Mexico) to Manila in the Philippines Islands. They made this trip once or twice yearly using a route which was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers. Some sources speculate that sightings of, or interaction with, Hawaii must have occurred.
By 1589, Ortelius was publishing the Maris Pacifici first ever Pacific map featuring an intriguing resemblance of the Hawaiian Islands &quot;Los Bolcanes&quot; and &quot;La Farfania&quot; in the middle of the Pacific by the Tropic of Cancer. The islands would therefore have been sighted by visitors to the point of being roughly mapped long before official records would confirm. 

In 1743, British Commodore George Anson captured a Spanish galleon on which he found a chart of the Pacific that depicted a group of islands at the same latitude as the Hawaiʻian islands but with a longitude ten degrees to the east. One of these islands is labeled &quot;La Mesa&quot; (‘the Table’). This is conjectured to be Hawaii Island since this “agrees very well with the appearance of Mauna Loa ... when seen at a great distance”.

Many scholars have refuted claims of Spanish knowledge of Hawaii during this period. However, based on accounts from native Hawaiian oral tradition, Oscar Spate leaves open the possibility of one-way contact and that it is “likely that Spanish castaways reached Hawaii and survived”.
&lt;section end=Pre1778 /&gt;

===Arrival and Death of James Cook===

Between 1768 and 1779, Captain James Cook led three voyages to chart unknown seas for Great Britain. While crossing the Pacific on his third voyage, he serendipitously encountered the Hawaiian Islands on January 18, 1778, the first documented contact by a European explorer. He first anchored off the coast of Kauai and met local inhabitants to trade and obtain water and food for his onward voyage. On February 2, 1778, Cook continued on to the North American continent, searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. After failing to find any passage, he decided to use the Hawaiian Islands as a base to over-winter and resupply before a second attempt the next season. His two ships first encountered the coast of Maui in November 1778, and eventually anchored in Kealakekua Bay on the west coast of Hawaii Island in mid January. Initially, the reception of the local people was respectful, friendly and accommodating. The expedition departed Kealakekua on Feb 4, but was forced to return again after a few days to make essential repairs after a storm severely damaged a mast. Relations with the local people now grew hostile and Cook was among those killed when a dispute led to violence.

After Cook&#x27;s visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian Islands attracted many European and American explorers, traders, and whalers, who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies. This began to influence the trajectory of Hawaiian history. The introduction of sexually transmitted diseases are attributed with certainty to the voyages of Cook, However, after the first visits of the &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot; to &quot;Mowee (Maui) and Ouwhyee (Hawaii)&quot; and finding &quot;that the venereal disease was not unknown to the natives,&quot; Cook himself believed &quot;that the disease was not left at these islands by our ships.&quot;

== Kingdom of Hawaii ==
The Kingdom of Hawaii lasted from 1795 until its overthrow in 1893 with the fall of the House of Kalakaua.

===Kamehameha I===

The first king to unite the Hawaiian Islands was Kamehameha I, founder of the House of Kamehameha and the Kingdom of Hawaii.

His lineage can be traced to half brothers, Kalaniʻōpuʻu and Keōua. Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s father was Kalaninuiʻīamamao while Keōua&#x27;s father was Kalanikeʻeaumoku, both sons of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. They shared a common mother, Kamakaʻīmoku. Both brothers served Alapaʻinui, the ruling King of Hawaii Island. Kamehameha I was born to Keōua and Kekuʻiapoiwa II, a granddaughter of Keaweʻīkehakialiʻiokamoku. Hawaiian genealogy leaves the possibility that Kahekili II might have actually been Kamehameha I&#x27;s biological father. However, Keōua acknowledged him as his son and this relationship is recognized by official genealogies.

The date of Kamehameha I&#x27;s birth is uncertain. The traditional &quot;ole&quot; chant of Keaka, wife of Alapaʻinui, indicates that Kamehameha I was born in &quot;ikuwā&quot; (winter) around November. Kamehameha was allegedly born during the passing of Halley&#x27;s Comet. In Hawaiian culture a comet indicated an important birth. Samuel Kamakau, wrote, &quot;It was during the time of the warfare among the chiefs of [the island of] Hawaii which followed the death of Keawe, chief over the whole island, that Kamehameha I was born&quot;. However, his general dating was challenged. Abraham Fornander wrote, &quot;when Kamehameha died in 1819 he was past eighty years old. His birth would thus fall between 1736 and 1740, probably nearer the former&quot;. William De Witt Alexander listed the birth year as 1736. He was first named Paiea but took the name Kamehameha, meaning &quot;The very lonely one&quot; or &quot;The one set alone&quot;.

Hawaiian prophecy said that this baby would one day unite the islands. Alapaʻi gave the young Kamehameha to his wife Keaka and her sister Hākau to care for. Kamehameha&#x27;s uncle Kalaniʻōpuʻu raised him after Keōua&#x27;s death. Kalaniʻōpuʻu ruled Hawaii as had his grandfather Keawe. He had advisors and priests. When word reached the ruler that chiefs were planning to murder the boy, he told Kamehameha:
After Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s death in 1782, Kīwalaʻō took his father&#x27;s place as first born and ruled the island, while Kamehameha I became the religious authority. Some chiefs preferred Kamehameha I and war broke out to overthrow Kīwalaʻō. Kīwalaʻō was killed in the Battle of Mokuʻōhai. This marked the start of a 15-year-long military campaign by Kamehameha I to conquer not only the island of Hawaii from Keōua and Kīwalaʻō&#x27;s uncle Keawemaʻuhili, but all the Hawaiian islands from the various chiefs who ruled them.

In 1791, after Keōua killed Keawemaʻuhili and claimed his territory, Kamehameha I sent envoys for Keōua and his brother Kaōleiokū to meet with him. Keōua and Kaōleiokū arrived in separate canoes. Keōua came to shore first where a fight broke out and he and all aboard were killed. Before the same could happen to the second canoe, Kamehameha I intervened. With the death of Keōua, Kamehameha I became king of the entire island.

On February 25, 1794, during his voyage of exploration, Captain George Vancouver negotiated with Kamehameha what the British understood to be the cession of the island of Hawaii to Great Britain though historians have argued that the Hawaiians regarded the agreement as the establishment of a protectorate. At that time, Kamehameha - who was king of Hawaii Island - also sought military help in the ongoing war against Maui and the other islands; the British were already assisting him with the construction of a warship. Vancouver presented Kamehameha with a British flag which flew unofficially as Hawaii&#x27;s flag until 1816. The modern Flag of Hawaii retains a Union Jack in the top-left corner as a legacy of this time.

In 1794, Kahekili II, the king of Maui and Oahu and suzerain of Kauai, died and left his territory to his brother Kāʻeokūlani and his son Kalanikūpule. A civil war between the two broke out, which ended when Kalanikūpule killed Kāʻeokūlani, taking control of Maui and Molokaʻi. This initiated a succession crisis on Kauaʻi, which had previously been ruled by Kāʻeokūlani. Seeing an opportunity, Kamehameha I invaded Kalanikūpule. He quickly took Maui and Molokai before moving onto Oahu. Here he defeated the remainder of Kalanikūpule&#x27;s forces at the decisive Battle of Nuʻuanu.

He thus extended his kingdom to encompass all of the main islands except Kauai and Niihau (both part of the Kingdom of Kauai). For his first royal residence, the new King built the first western-style structure in the Hawaiian Islands, known as the &quot;Brick Palace&quot;. The location became the seat of government until 1845. The structure was built at Keawa&#x27;iki point in Lahaina, Maui. Two ex-convicts from Australia&#x27;s Botany Bay penal colony built the home. It was begun in 1798 and was completed in 1802. The house was intended for Kaʻahumanu, but she rejected it in favor of an adjacent, traditional home.

After two failed attempts to invade Kauai (in 1795 and 1804), in 1810 Kamehameha negotiated the peaceful absorption of Kauai into his kingdom. The king of Kauai, Kaumualiʻi, agreed to recognize Kamehameha as his suzerain, and in exchange was allowed to continue administering Kauai. Thus concluded the unification of the Hawaiian islands.

Kamehameha I had many wives, but held two in the highest regard. Keōpūolani was the highest ranking &quot;aliʻi&quot; of her time and mother to his sons, Liholiho and Kauikeaouli. Kaʻahumanu was his favorite. Kamehameha I died in 1819, succeeded by Liholiho.

===Kamehameha II===

After Kamehameha I&#x27;s death, Liholiho left Kailua for a week and returned to be crowned king. At the ceremony, attended by commoners and nobles, he approached the circle of chiefs, as Kaʻahumanu, the central figure in the group and Dowager Queen, said, &quot;&quot;Hear me O Divine one, for I make known to you the will of your father. Behold these chiefs and the men of your father, and these your guns, and this your land, but you and I shall share the realm together&quot;.&quot; Liholiho agreed officially, which began a unique system of dual-government consisting of a King and co-ruler similar to a regent. 

Kamehameha II shared his rule with his stepmother, Kaʻahumanu. She defied Hawaiian &quot;kapu&quot; by dining with the young king, leading to the end of the Hawaiian religion (the period known as ʻAi Noa). Some Hawaiian leaders opposed the efforts to abolish the Hawaiian religion. A faction led by Keaoua Kekuaokalani, a nephew of Kamehameha I, revolted against Kamehameha II and his court. Despite gathering some support, the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Kuamo&#x27;o in December 1819.

Kamehameha II died, along with his wife, Queen Kamāmalu in 1824 on a state visit to England, succumbing to measles. He was King for 5 years.

The couple&#x27;s remains were returned to Hawaii by Boki. Aboard the ship &quot;The Blond,&quot; his wife Liliha and Kekūanaōʻa were baptized as Christians. Kaʻahumanu also converted and became a powerful Christian influence on Hawaiian society until her death in 1832. Since the new king was only 12 years old, Kaʻahumanu reigned as senior ruler and named Boki as her &quot;Kuhina Nui&quot;.

Boki left Hawaii on a trip to find sandalwood to cover a debt and was lost at sea. His wife, Liliha took the governorship of Maui and unsuccessfully attempted to revolt against Kaʻahumanu, who upon Boki&#x27;s departure, had installed Kīnaʻu as a co-governor.

===Kaʻahumanu===

Kaʻahumanu was born on Maui around 1777. Her parents were &quot;aliʻi&quot; of a lower-ranking line. She became Kamehameha&#x27;s consort at fourteen. George Vancouver states: &quot;[O]ne of the finest woman we had yet seen on any of the islands&quot;. To wed the young woman, Kamehameha had to consent to make her children his heirs, but she had no issue.

Before his death, Kamehameha selected Kaʻahumanu to rule along with his son. Kaʻahumanu adopted the boy. She became the senior ruler. A portrait artist remarked of her: &quot;This Old Dame is the most proud, unbending Lady in the whole island. As the widow of [Kamehameha], she possesses unbound authority and respect, not any of which she is inclined to lay aside on any occasion whatsoever&quot;. She was one of Hawaii&#x27;s most influential leaders.

On March 30, 1820, fourteen American Protestant missionaries (the Pioneer Company) arrived in Hawaii. They were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Over the course of a little over 40-years (1820-1863 – the “Missionary Period”), about 180-men and women sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in twelve Companies served in Hawaii. They converted Hawaiian people to the Christian faith, developed the written form of Hawaiian language, and encouraged the spread of English on the islands. But many Hawaiians blame the missionaries for discouraging many Hawaiian cultural practices.

In April 1824, Kaʻahumanu publicly acknowledged her conversion to Protestant Christianity and encouraged her subjects to be baptized into the faith. She took it upon herself to enforce Christian policies with her power, banning of the Hawaiian Dance hula in 1830.

=== Kamehameha III ===

Kauikeaouli was the second son of Kamehameha I and was born in Keauhou Bay on the island of Hawai&#x27;i. Kauikeaouli&#x27;s birthdate is not known, but historians estimated it to be on March 17, 1814, making him about 14 years younger than Liholiho. After his birth, Kuakini refused to take him, because Kauikeaouli appeared to be lifeless. However, the prophet of another chief declared that the baby would live. They cleaned him and put him on a sacred area where the seer fanned him and sprinkled him with water while reciting a prayer. The baby started to move and make sounds. Kaikioewa was chosen as the baby&#x27;s guardian and raised him in a remote location.

Kauikeaouli became King after Liholiho&#x27;s death in 1824. Kamehameha III began the writing of Hawaii&#x27;s first formal laws and created a governmental structure. He replaced indigenous traditions with Anglo-American common law. The action was prompted from increasing threat of colonizing forces who were intrigued by the location of the islands. Kamehameha III was advised by William Richards, a former missionary. Richards travelled to the United States in an attempt to learn more about its politics and government structure. He taught Kamehameha III his findings and together they created the first constitution of Hawaii in 1840. Kamehameha III enacted laws that recognized human rights and established a new system for land ownership called Mahele. Another major decision was to move the capital from Lahaina to Honolulu. 
In 1843, for a five-month period, Kamehameha III allowed British captain Lord George Paulet to control the islands. Kamehameha III wrote a letter to the British government informing them of Paulet&#x27;s actions. Great Britain then reestablished the islands independence on July 31, 1843, and Kamehameha III uttered what became the Hawaiian motto, &quot;Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono,&quot; meaning&quot;,&quot; &quot;The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness.&quot; The day became a national holiday known as &quot;Lā Hoʻihoʻi Ea.&quot;

Kamehameha III married Queen Kalama on February 14, 1837. Kamehameha had one son with his mistress Jane Lahilahi who survived to adulthood, Albert Edward Kūnuiakea. He had two boys with Queen Kalama who died young: Prince Keaweaweʻulaokalani I and Prince Keaweaweʻulaokalani II. Alexander Liholiho, Kamehameha III&#x27;s nephew, was taken in by the King and pronounced as heir to the throne. In 1854 he became king as a result of a sudden death of Kamehameha III, likely by stroke.

=== Kamehameha IV ===

Alexander Liholiho was born on February 9, 1834, in the capital of the country, Honolulu. 21 years later he took the throne and the name Kamehameha IV. He studied at the Chiefs&#x27; Children&#x27;s School and learned French from Protestant missionaries. The princes did not have a happy experience at the school and were often sent to bed hungry. Liholiho left the school when he was 14 and began studying law. In his late teens, Liholiho began traveling with his brother, Lot Kapuāiwa, in an attempt to establish Hawaii&#x27;s presence as an independent nation. They travelled to nations such as the United States, France, and Panama. After an 1849 French attack by Admiral de Tromelin, Liholiho was tasked with trying to improve relations with France. Liholiho and Kapuaiwa were accompanied by Gerrit P. Judd to France with hopes of a treaty. After three months they ultimately failed and returned to the islands. Following his return he was appointed to Kamehameha III&#x27;s privy council in 1852.

After taking the throne in 1855, Kamehameha IV&#x27;s main goal was to limit Anglo-American influence. He ended negotiations over the American annexation of Hawaii. that had been started by Kamehameha III. In 1856 Kamehameha IV had an Anglican wedding with Emma Rooke. Emma Rooke was the great-grandniece of King Kamehameha I and was an &quot;ali&#x27;i&quot;. Queen Emma was very pro-British due to her British adoptive parents. In 1858 the Queen and King had their only child, Prince Albert Edward Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa a Kamehameha. The prince died in 1862, but was described as kind and cheerful. Kamehameha IV established the Anglican church in Hawaii. The cause of death for the prince is believed to have been appendicitis. Kamehameha IV blamed himself for the death. As a result, the Queen and the King prioritized healthcare, because diseases like leprosy and influenza were destroying the Hawaiian people. The king&#x27;s plan was struck down because a healthcare plan had been part of the Constitution of 1852.

The King&#x27;s rule came to an end on November 30, 1863, when he died from chronic asthma. The King had been experiencing deteriorating health for several months before dying. Kamehameha IV was succeeded by his brother Lot who became Kamehameha V. Queen Emma remained involved in politics until she ultimately lost the race to become the Kingdom&#x27;s ruling monarch to David Kalakaua.

=== Royal election ===

The legislature decided to hold a public referendum and to choose who the public voted for. Queen Emma and David Kalākaua both declared their candidacy. Kalākaua won the 1874 election. While the legislature was formally voting to certify Kalākaua as King, Queen Emma&#x27;s supporters descended on the capitol and attacked the legislators. 13 legislators supporting Kalākaua were injured, including one who died after he was tossed from a window. The monarchy had no army and the police deserted, leading the government to request the support of American troops to quell the riot.

The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy. Kalākaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to violating the traditions of the Hawaiian people, who believed that the &#x27;Āina was fertile, sacred and not for sale.

=== Whaling ===

In 1816, the populations of Honolulu was around 3,000, almost all Hawaiians, although 16 Americans lived on Oahu, all before whaling. As whaling grew, the population grew with it, reaching 23,000 in 1890. One ship arrived in Honolulu in 1820, 62 visited in 1822, 98 in 1829, and 110 in 1833. In Lahaina, 17 whaleships anchored in 1824, 62 in 1830 and 80 in 1832. The crews typically numbered around 30 men. They visited once or twice/year, to restock supplies. US whaling peaked in the 1850s, and was mostly over by the end of the Hawaiian Kingdom.

=== Sugar reciprocity ===
The first permanent sugar plantation began in Kauai in 1835. William Hooper leased 980 acres of land from Kamehameha III. Within thirty years plantations operated on all four main islands. Sugar upended Hawaii&#x27;s economy.

American influence in Hawaiian government began when U.S. plantation owners demanded a say in Kingdom politics. Pressure from these plantation owners was felt by the King and chiefs as demands for land tenure. Kamehameha III responded to the demands with the Mahele, distributing land to all Hawaiians as advocated by missionaries including Gerrit P. Judd.

During the 1850s, the U.S. import tariff on sugar from Hawaii was much higher than the tariffs Hawaiians were charging the U.S. Kamehameha III sought reciprocity. The monarch wished to lower U.S. tariffs and make Hawaiian sugar competitive with other foreign suppliers. In 1854 Kamehameha III&#x27;s proposal of reciprocity between the countries died in the U.S. Senate.

U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of its west coast. The military was especially interested in Pu&#x27;uloa, Pearl Harbor. The sale of one harbor was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs and owned a country home near Pu&#x27;uloa. He showed two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, Kamehameha, was content to let Bishop run most business affairs, but the ceding of lands was unpopular with Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations, but he died on February 3, 1874.

From 1874 through 1875, Kalākaua made a state visit to Washington DC to gather support for a new treaty. Congress agreed to the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 for seven years in exchange for Ford Island (Pearl Harbor). After the treaty, sugar production expanded from 12,000 acres to 125,000 acres in 1891. At the end of the seven-year term, the treaty lapsed given little interest in the United States.

===Rebellion of 1887 and the Bayonet Constitution===

On January 20, 1887, the United States began leasing Pearl Harbor. Shortly afterwards, a group of mostly non-Hawaiians calling themselves the Hawaiian Patriotic League began the Rebellion of 1887. They drafted a constitution, written by Lorrin Thurston, the Hawaiian Minister of the Interior who used the Hawaiian militia to threaten Kalākaua. Kalākaua was forced to dismiss his cabinet ministers and sign the constitution, lessening his power. It became known as the Bayonet Constitution due to the threat of force.
Grover Cleveland was president at the time, and his secretary of state Thomas F. Bayard instructed American minister George W. Merrill that in the event of another revolution in Hawaii, the priority was to protect American commerce, lives and property. Bayard specified, &quot;the assistance of the officers of our Government vessels, if found necessary, will therefore be promptly afforded to promote the reign of law and respect for orderly government in Hawaii.&quot; In July 1889, a small scale rebellion ensued, and Minister Merrill landed Marines to protect Americans; the State Department explicitly approved this action. Merrill&#x27;s replacement, minister John L. Stevens, followed those instructions in his controversial actions of 1893.

Although Kalākaua&#x27;s signature alone had no legal power, the constitution allowed him to appoint cabinet ministers, but stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature. Eligibility to vote for the House of Nobles was altered, requiring that both candidates and voters own property valued three thousand dollars or more, or have an annual income of six hundred dollars or more. This disenfranchised two thirds of native Hawaiians and other ethnic groups who had previously been eligible to vote. This constitution benefited the foreign plantation owners. With the legislature now responsible for naturalizing aliens, Americans and Europeans could retain their home country citizenship and vote as citizens of the kingdom. Along with voting privileges, Americans could hold office and retain their US citizenship, something not afforded in any other nation and even allowed Americans to vote without becoming naturalized. Asian immigrants were no longer able to acquire citizenship or vote.

===Wilcox Rebellion of 1888===

The Wilcox Rebellion of 1888 was a plot to overthrow King David Kalākaua and replace him with his sister in a coup d&#x27;état. This was in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king.

Kalākaua&#x27;s distant cousin, a native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, Robert William Wilcox returned to Hawaii in October 1887 when the funding for his study program stopped. Wilcox, Charles B. Wilson, Princess Liliuokalani, and Sam Nowlein plotted to overthrow Kalākaua and replace him with Liliuokalani. 300 Hawaiian conspirators hid in Iolani Barracks and an alliance was formed with the Royal Guard, but the plot was accidentally discovered in January 1888, less than 48 hours before the revolt. No one was prosecuted, but Wilcox was exiled. On February 11, 1888, Wilcox left Hawaii for San Francisco, intending to return to Italy with his wife.

Princess Liliuokalani was offered the throne several times by the Missionary Party who had forced the Bayonet Constitution on her brother, but she rejected the offers. In January 1891, Kalākaua traveled to San Francisco for his health, staying at the Palace Hotel. He died there on January 20. Liliuokalani then ascended the throne. She called her brother&#x27;s reign &quot;a golden age materially for Hawaii&quot;.

=== Liliuokalani&#x27;s attempt to re-write Constitution ===
Liliuokalani assumed the throne in the middle of an economic crisis. The McKinley Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating Hawaii&#x27;s advantage. Many Hawaii businesses and citizens lost revenue; in response Liliuokalani proposed a lottery and opium licensing. Her ministers and closest friends were all opposed to this plan; they unsuccessfully tried to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis.

Liliuokalani&#x27;s chief desire was to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Bayonet Constitution and promulgating a new one. The 1893 Constitution would have extended suffrage by reducing some property requirements. It would have disenfranchised many non-citizen Europeans and Americans. The Queen toured several islands on horseback, talking to the people about her ideas and receiving strong support, including a lengthy petition. However, when the Queen informed her cabinet of her plans, they withheld their support, because of what they expected to be her opponent&#x27;s likely response.

Liliuokalani&#x27;s attempt to promulgate a new constitution on January 14, 1893, precipitated the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii three days later. The conspirators&#x27; stated goals were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek US annexation.

===Overthrow===

The overthrow was led by Thurston, who was the grandson of American missionaries and derived his support primarily from the American and European business class and other supporters of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Most of the leaders of the 13-member Committee of Safety that deposed the queen were American and European citizens who were Kingdom subjects. They included legislators, government officers, and a Supreme Court Justice.
On January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom, Charles B. Wilson was tipped off by detectives of the planned coup. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13 Council members and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties with U.S. Government Minister John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied by Attorney General Arthur P. Peterson and the Queen&#x27;s cabinet. They feared that the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston, Wilson began to collect his troops. Wilson and Captain of the Royal Household Guard Samuel Nowlein rallied a force of 496 troops to protect the Queen.

===United States military support ===

The coup efforts were supported by Stevens. The coup placed the queen under house arrest at Iolani Palace. Advised about supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property by the Committee, Stevens summoned a company of U.S. Marines from the USS &quot;Boston&quot; and two companies of U.S. sailors to take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on January 16. 162 armed sailors and Marines aboard the USS &quot;Boston&quot; in Honolulu Harbor came ashore under orders of neutrality. The sailors and Marines did not participate, but their presence intimidated royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, &quot;the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.&quot;

== United States territory ==

=== Annexation ===
In March 1897, William McKinley, a Republican expansionist, succeeded Democrat Grover Cleveland as U.S. president. He prepared a treaty of annexation but it lacked the needed 2/3 majority in the Senate given Democratic opposition. A joint resolution, written by Democratic Congressman Francis G. Newlands to annex Hawaii passed both the House and Senate; it needed only majority support. The U.S. Supreme Court gave tacit recognition to the annexation in De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1, 196 (1901). The Spanish–American War had broken out and many leaders wanted control of Pearl Harbor to help the United States become a Pacific power and protect the West Coast. Kalākaua was concerned over a possible United States seizure and in Kalākaua&#x27;s 1881 world tour, he met secretly with the Japanese Emperor to discuss bringing Hawaii under Japan&#x27;s protection. He proposed to unite the two nations with an arranged marriage between his 5-year-old niece Princess Kaʻiulani and 13-year-old Prince Yamashina Sadamaro. Japan rejected his proposal over concerns that this would worsen relations between Japan and the United States. In 1897 Japan sent warships to Hawaii to oppose annexation. This made the decision more urgent, especially since the islands&#x27; fourth-largest population was of Japanese heritage. They were largely aligned with Japan.

McKinley signed the Newlands Resolution annexing Hawaii on July 7, 1898, creating the Territory of Hawaii. On February 22, 1900, the Hawaiian Organic Act established a territorial government. Annexation opponents held that this was illegal, claiming the Queen was the only legitimate ruler. McKinley appointed Sanford B. Dole as territorial governor. The territorial legislature convened for the first time on February 20, 1901. Hawaiians formed the Hawaiian Independent Party, under the leadership of Robert Wilcox, Hawaii&#x27;s first congressional delegate.

=== Plantations ===
Sugarcane plantations in Hawaii expanded during the territorial period. Some companies diversified and dominated related industries such as transportation, banking and real estate. Economic and political power was concentrated in what were known as the &quot;Big Five&quot;.

A 1909 strike by Japanese farm workers led to a brief experiment importing Russian laborers, mostly from Siberia. False promises of land grants by a recruiter named A.W. Perelstrous resulted in strikes among the Russian workers. Hardships included a measles outbreak, lack of ability to communicate with Hawaiians, and culture clashes. Most Russians ended up moving to California, New York, or back to Russia (mostly after the 1917 Russian Revolution).

=== World War II ===
==== Attack on Pearl Harbor ====
Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941, by the Imperial Japanese Navy, killing almost 2,500 people and sinking the main Pacific battleship fleet. Fortuitously for the Americans, the four Pacific aircraft carriers were at sea and escaped damage. Hawaii was put under martial law until 1945.

Unlike the Pacific Coast where 100,000 ethnic Japanese-American citizens were interned, the Japanese-American population in Hawaii avoided internment, although hundreds of pro-Japan leaders were arrested.

Pearl Harbor was the U.S.&#x27; main forward base for the Pacific War. The Japanese planned to attack in summer 1942 but were defeated at the Battle of Midway. Hundreds of thousands of American soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen passed through the islands. The islands were used for training and bivouac throughout the war.

Hawaii residents formed the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a U.S. Army infantry regiment. The regiment was composed almost entirely of American soldiers of Japanese ancestry. It fought primarily in Italy, southern France and Germany. The 442nd Regiment was the most decorated unit for its size and length of service in American history. Its 4,000 members had to be reinforced nearly 2.5 times to replace casualties. In total, about 14,000 Hawaiians served in the regiment, earning 9,486 Purple Hearts. The unit was awarded eight Presidential Unit Citations (five in one month). Twenty-one of its members, including Hawaii&#x27;s former U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, were awarded Medals of Honor. Its motto was &quot;Go for Broke&quot;.

=== Politics ===
Initially, the Hawaii Republican Party dominated territorial politics. However, in 1954 a series of non-violent industry-wide strikes, protests and other civil disobedience transpired. In the territorial elections of 1954 the Democratic Party of Hawaii gained the majority and lobbied for statehood. The labor force unionized, hastening the plantations&#x27; decline.

== Statehood ==

President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Hawaii Admission Act on March 18, 1959, which created the means for Hawaiian statehood. After a referendum in which over 93% of Hawaiian citizens voted in favor of statehood, Hawaii was admitted as the 50th state on August 21, 1959.

=== Annexation legacy ===

From contact through to annexation, the number of Native Hawaiians in Hawaii declined. Bottom was reached in the first census conducted by the United States in 1900 at 37,656. Thereafter the Native Hawaiian population in Hawaii increased with every census.

For many Native Hawaiians, the relationship between the islands and the mainland is problematic, in part because of how Hawaii lost its independence. By contrast the ultimate step of becoming a U.S. State was done properly.

The 1960s Hawaiian Renaissance led to renewed interest in the Hawaiian language, culture and identity.

Congress passed the Apology Resolution () and it was signed by President Bill Clinton on November 23, 1993. This resolution apologized &quot;to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893... and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination.&quot; The implications of this resolution have been debated. The resolution&#x27;s description of Hawaiian history has been criticized, for example, for ignoring the fact that the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom was led by Hawaiian citizens on the Committee of Safety. The resolution also does not explain why it applies only to people descended from persons living in pre-contact Hawaii, as opposed to all subjects of the Kingdom at the time of the overthrow.

In 2000, Senator Daniel Akaka proposed what was called the Akaka Bill to extend federal recognition to those of Native Hawaiian ancestry as a sovereign group similar to Native American tribes. The bill did not pass.

Its appearance is similar to the Alfa Romeo 164, launched the same year and also styled by Pininfarina. While the 405 shares its floorpan with the Citroën BX, it does not have that car&#x27;s hydropneumatic suspension, except for the 4x4 version on the rear axle (SRix4, Mi16x4 and T16). As with the BX, the 405 used TU/XU petrol and XUD diesel engines. The 405 was the last Peugeot vehicle sold in the United States, on sale between 1988 and 1991, including the Mi16.

The 405 has been available as a saloon and estate, in front-wheel and four-wheel drive. No coupé model was ever offered, unlike the 504 and later 406: only two examples of the purpose-built, two-door 405 Turbo 16 (not to be confused with 405 T16) were made.

==History==
In July 1987, Peugeot unveiled ten versions of the 405 saloon simultaneously for the 1988 model year, with sales on the continent beginning in October 1987 and sales in the United Kingdom beginning in January 1988. It succeeded the long-running Peugeot 305, but also the Chrysler Alpine hatchback and Solara saloon which had been discontinued when the Talbot brand was axed a year earlier. The slightly smaller 305 was discontinued from the Peugeot range soon after the 405&#x27;s launch, with production of the larger 505 ending a few years later. Peugeot&#x27;s new range-topping model after 1989 was the larger 605.

Estate sales began in May 1988, although the British market did not receive estate versions until October 1988. No coupé was ever offered to the public, unlike the 504 and later 406. Right hand drive versions being produced at the former plant of Rootes/Chrysler at Ryton near Coventry, and left hand drive production taking place at Sochaux in France.

Four cylinder petrol engines ranging from 1.4 to 1.9 liters and were available. In 1988, naturally aspirated (1.9) and turbocharged (1.8) diesel engines were added to the range. The 500,000th 405 was produced during 1989, followed by the one millionth 405 to leave the Sochaux factory in 1990. This was also when the BE1 transmission was replaced by the BE3.
In 1991, there were updates to the dashboard, steering wheel, and soundproofing, but for 1992, the Phase II model arrived with a new boot with better ingress, new rear lights and boot design, and a new dashboard. 405 production had reached over 1,500,000 by this time.

In the autumn of 1995, the 405&#x27;s replacement, the 406 was introduced and the 405 saloon was discontinued. An airbag had been available on the 405 since 1994, and standard on the left hand drive Mi16 and T16. At the beginning of 1997, the estate version of the 406 was launched, marking the end of European 405 production after ten years.

The 405 was one of Europe&#x27;s best selling larger family cars, particularly in France and Britain. It was the eighth best selling car in Britain in 1992 and 1993. The 405 also became a popular model in Thailand, following the success of the Peugeot 505 after the Government of Thailand cancelled a restriction on CBU car imports in the late 1980s.

==Versions==
The 405 range included three petrol engines and two diesel engines, all four cylinders, in a variety of states of tune and specification. The range was tailored to suit different export markets. The 1.6 litre saloon featured a low drag co efficient of , with other models varying up to . The 1.4 litre (1,360 cc) engine was fitted with a four-speed manual gearbox. It produces at 5,600 rpm.

The 1.6 litre (1,580 cc) engine was fitted with a five speed manual gearbox and produced at 6,000 rpm. The 1.9 litre (1,905 cc) engine was available with a five speed manual gearbox, with an option of an automatic in the lower powered version.

The eight valve version of the 1905 cc engine was available in two levels of tune; or , with numbers varying somewhat depending on the year and the market. A 16-valve version was available with the Mi16 model and this produced at 6,500 rpm and could reach a top speed of . The catalyzed version produces with a top speed of .

In 1992, the range was facelifted. While the changes were deep, including a modified bottom plate and chassis structure, the design was almost indistinguishable from the pre-facelift model.

The windscreens were now bonded; all of these changes increased torsional rigidity considerably while still allowing a deeper opening for the bootlid of the sedan. The taillights were also redesigned and the trim piece between them removed, all in the image of the bigger 605. The interior was also redone, with an all new dashboard and door trim, inheriting many detail parts as well as the overall appearance from the 605.

In April 1993, the T16 was introduced to celebrate the successes of the competition model, with a 2.0 litre 16 valve turbocharged XU10J4TE engine with water cooled chargecooler, constant four wheel drive with 53/47% power distribution and self regulating hydraulic rear axle. It was never built in a right hand drive model.

The T16 produced at (normal boost) or at (overboost) which lasts for 45 seconds. 1,061 examples were built, with ten of these being delivered for use by the National Gendarmerie. The diesel engine options included a 1.9 litre (1,905 cc) unit producing at 4,600 rpm or a turbocharged 1.8 litre (1,769 cc) unit producing .

The DL and S were also available in wagon form, called Sportswagon. Peugeot withdrew from the markets in the United States and Canada after the model year of 1991.

===Iran===
Iran Khodro also produces several models derived from the 405. The Peugeot Pars, also known as the Peugeot Persia, is a facelifted 405 with a redesigned front end including clear lamp lenses and a revised rear. The Peugeot RD is a rear wheel drive car which has a 405 body and mechanical parts from the Paykan. Since 2006, it has been sold in certain markets in the Middle East as the Peugeot ROA.

The Samand, which was designed to be a &quot;national car&quot; for Iran, is also based on the 405 platform. It replaced the long running Paykan which was itself based on the Hillman Hunter, an ancestor (in corporate ownership and model positioning terms) of the 405, having been produced by the Rootes Group and Chrysler UK from 1963 until 1979, the year that Peugeot purchased Chrysler&#x27;s European operations.

Iran Khodro, the leading Iranian car manufacturer produces the following models of Peugeot 405:
* Peugeot 405 GL/GLX with 1.6L &amp; 1.9L 8 valve carburettor engine, this model was taken out of production in 2002.
* Peugeot 405 GLX with 1.8L 8 valve fuel injection engine and modified options, the gasoline model production stopped in 2020 And in 2022, the production of the SLX model with the TU5 engine along with Samand was stopped at the Iran Khodro factory in Tabriz.
* Peugeot 405 SLX with 1.6L 16 valve PSA TU5 engine, redesigned dashboard with two airbags, ABS brakes The production of this model was stopped in 2022
* Peugeot Pars: A modern facelift of the 405 in four models with 1.8L 8 valve, 1.9L 8 valve, 1.6L 16 valve (PSA TU5 engine) and 1.8L 16 valve engines.
* Peugeot RD and ROA: Cheaper models that use the eight-valve Hillman Avenger (Paykan) engine in the 405 body. The RD uses the original 1.6-litre version, this was upgraded to a 1.7-litre unit in the ROA. Production of these models was stopped in 2011.
* IKCO Samand, Soren, Dena And Dena Plus: Iran&#x27;s National Cars which are developments using the 405 platform
* IKCO Arisun: badged under Iran Khodro&#x27;s own brand, but still heavily based on the 405. It is a coupe utility which has been in production since 2015.

==Motorsport==
The motorsport version of the 405, the rallying 405 Turbo 16 GR, was very different from the road going 405. It was built in a coupé body style in mid-engine configuration, had constant four wheel drive with electronically adjustable center differential like the 205 T16, as it was based on the same technology. At least four were produced, competing in hill climbs and the Paris-Dakar rally.

Today, three are in the official Peugeot museum, and the other is in a private collection.

* 1988: Finnish driver Ari Vatanen set a new record in the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb (an award-winning film of the drive titled &quot;Climb Dance&quot; was made by Jean Louis Mourey). Kankkunen and Piironen win the Paris-Dakar Rally in the 405 T16 GR.
* 1989: Victory in the Paris-Dakar rally by the Vatanen-Ickx team in a 405 T16 GR.
* 1990: Victory in the Paris-Dakar rally by the Vatanen-Berglund team in a 405 T16 GR.

Racing 405s much closer in specification to the road going models were campaigned for several years in European touring car racing during the early to mid 1990s, most notably in the British Touring Car Championship and the French Supertourisme Championship. In Britain, the 405 did not achieve much success, but the car won the French series in both 1994 and 1995, in the hands of Laurent Aïello.

<text>The strontium unit is a unit used to measure the amount of radioactivity from strontium-90, a radionuclide found in nuclear fallout, in a subject&#x27;s body. Since the human body absorbs strontium as if it were calcium, incorporating it into the skeleton, its presence is very common. One strontium unit is equal to one picocurie from strontium-90 per gram of calcium (37 becquerels per kilogram) in the subject&#x27;s skeleton.

The United States National Academy of Sciences holds that the maximum safe measure of strontium-90 in a person is one hundred strontium units (3700 Bq/kg). The average American is estimated to have three to four strontium units.

The strontium unit was formerly known briefly as the sunshine unit, the name was derived from a recognizable source of background radiation (the Sun), and used as a convenient measure. Ten sunshine units are comparable to natural background radiation. One thousand sunshine units were not expected to produce any visible skeletal damage, but ten thousand units might be hazardous.

<text>Middleton is a town in Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Situated on the north bank of the Annapolis River, it is located close to the centre of the Annapolis Valley, from which it gets its nickname, &quot;The Heart of the Valley&quot;.

==History==

Where the Annapolis River and the Nictaux River meet was a popular shad fishing spot for Mi&#x27;kmaq families before the arrival of the European settlers. It would be later settled by French Acadians that used these waterways to reach the capital of Port-Royal and farming. In the late 1750s the region was settled by New England Planters, and Loyalists to replace the ousted French Acadians. The first four families to be granted land there would later comprise the town of Middleton. They included families with names like Gates and Marshall and Richardson. Col. Philip Richardson received six lots of two hundred and fifty acres each, which ran from the Annapolis River halfway to the Mountain to the north, while his neighbour to the west, Anthony Marshall, got two 424-acre lots which ran all the way to the top of the mountain. A Neily family, from Ireland via Ardoise in Hants County, got the next two lots in what would be Lower Middleton, while Benjamin Chesley got the last two lots, next to the town limits.

At a public meeting held December 18, 1854, Rev. James Robertson having been appointed chairman and W. A. Fowler, secretary, passed the resolution unanimously. &#x27;Resolved, first, that the locality hitherto known as Wilmot Corner, or Fowler&#x27;s Corner, be henceforth called by the name of Middleton&#x27;. This name was chosen by its citizens and selected because of its location midway between Halifax and Yarmouth.

The town was incorporated in 1909.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Middleton had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Economy ==
The re-opening of the Torbrook Iron Mines and the second railway line in 1889 sparked a decade of rapid growth and development. With many industries supporting and connected to the agriculture and manufacturing industry. Today the town&#x27;s economy is also heavily influenced by its proximity to the air force base CFB Greenwood in nearby Kings County.

==Board of Trade==
The early records of the Board of Trade were lost in the Great Fire of 1911 but from the reports of its initial activities, the board was formed out of a need to vigorously pursue the issues of the day which affected business and industry - railway schedules and rates, street lighting and a variety of matters involving the municipal government of the day. Two merchants, Harry Reed and Gorden Gross, formed the Board, with newspaper publisher Fred Cox as their secretary-treasurer.

==Transportation==
Middleton is at the half-way point between Halifax and Yarmouth on Highway 101 and Trunk 1.

Middleton is the northern terminus of Trunk 10 which connects the town with Bridgewater and Lunenburg on the South Shore.

The town was located on the Dominion Atlantic Railway&#x27;s (DAR) mainline from Halifax to Yarmouth and was also served by CN Rail&#x27;s line from Bridgewater to Bridgetown (and on to Victoria Beach). CN Rail abandoned its line through Middleton in 1982; it had formerly been the Nova Scotia Central Railway (NSCR). The DAR abandoned its mainline through the town in March 1990, following the January 15, 1990, abandonment of the &quot;Evangeline&quot; passenger train service by Via Rail. The abandoned DAR and CN railway lines are currently owned by the Government of Nova Scotia and used as recreational trails. The 1917 railway station is now a railway museum operated by the Middleton Railway Museum Society.

Middleton is home to the Annapolis Valley MacDonald Museum, which is housed in the original Macdonald Consolidated School. This school, founded in 1903, was the first consolidated school in Canada, established with a grant from the Macdonald Tobacco Company of Montreal. The museum has many travelling exhibits, and is the home of the Nova Scotia Museum Clock collection.

==Festivals and events==
Middleton hosts an annual three-day festival called &quot;Heart of the Valley Days&quot; every summer, during the month of July.

Middleton Farmers&#x27; Market was founded in 2008. It is held every Friday during the summer and fall in the park across from the Town Office from 3 pm to 7 pm. The Market is a non-profit member-run organization of market vendors and individuals.

<text>Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, commonly referred to by its acronym EDSA (), is a major circumferential road around Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. It passes through 6 of Metro Manila&#x27;s 17 local government units or cities, namely, from north to south, Caloocan, Quezon City, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Pasay.

Named after academic Epifanio de los Santos, the section of the road from Balintawak Interchange in Quezon City to Magallanes Interchange in Makati connects the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX). The avenue passes through the major financial districts of the metropolis which are Triangle Park, Araneta City, Ortigas Center, Makati CBD, and Bay City. It is the longest and the most congested highway in the metropolis, stretching some .

== Structure ==
The entire avenue forms part of Circumferential Road 4 (C-4) of Metro Manila&#x27;s arterial road network, National Route 1 (N1) of the Philippine highway network and Asian Highway 26 (AH26) of the Asian Highway Network. The locations around the avenue were marked with great economic and industrial growth, proven by the fact that all but two industrial centers in the Metropolis are directly accessible from the thoroughfare. The decent economic growth of the areas around the avenue adds a significant volume of traffic on the avenue, and in recent estimates, and an average of 385,096 vehicles go through it every day.
The avenue is a divided carriageway, often consisting of 12 lanes, 6 in either direction, with the elevated railroads Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3 and Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 often serving as its median. Although it is not an expressway, traffic rules and speed limits are strictly implemented to the vehicles that pass along it. It is operated by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and is maintained and constantly being repaired by the Department of Public Works and Highways, whose maintenance over EDSA excludes the extension from Roxas Boulevard to SM Mall of Asia in Pasay.

== Route description ==

EDSA starts from the Bonifacio Monument (Monumento) Circle in Caloocan, its intersection with MacArthur Highway, Rizal Avenue Extension, and Samson Road, the western side of the C-4 Road. The roundabout is also the marker of the 1896 Revolution by Andres Bonifacio. The of the road are in Caloocan. The Avenue will then enter Quezon City through the Balintawak district, after an intersection with the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and A. Bonifacio Avenue at the Balintawak Interchange.

EDSA crosses much of the northern part of Quezon City, passing through the Balintawak, Muñoz, and Project 7 districts. It sharply curves southwards after crossing the North Avenue-West Avenue Intersection in the Triangle Business Park. On the north side of EDSA is the SM North EDSA. In front of it are the TriNoma mall and the Eton Centris or Centris Walk. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center and its transmitter can be easily seen from EDSA and continues southwards, slightly turning westwards slowly until it leaves the Triangle Park after crossing the East Avenue-Timog Avenue Intersection, where the GMA Network Center is located. It continues through the district of Cubao, entering the Araneta City after crossing the Aurora Boulevard Tunnel. In Cubao, several malls, infrastructure and offices are located. The Avenue curves southwards and crosses Santolan Road near Socorro, where the twin bases of Camps Crame and Aguinaldo are located. EDSA then continues on its route and serves as the boundary of the cities of San Juan and Quezon City. Primex Tower, the tallest building in San Juan, is located on the southbound side of EDSA at its junction with Connecticut Street, while People Power Monument can be seen on the northbound side of EDSA at its junction with White Plains Avenue. After in Quezon City, EDSA will eventually leave the city, straddling along the boundary with San Juan. EDSA enters Mandaluyong after crossing the borders of the Ortigas Center. In the Ortigas Center, some notable buildings around the area are the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration building, Robinsons Galleria, SM Megamall, and the bronze EDSA Shrine, a memorial church to the 1986 People Power Revolution. It then curves smoothly westwards after it crosses Boni Avenue and Pioneer Street, and crosses the Pasig River via the Guadalupe Bridge, leaving the city of Mandaluyong.

After crossing the Pasig River, EDSA enters the city of Makati through Guadalupe, where it provides access to the Rockwell Center, a major mixed-use business park in Makati, through J.P. Rizal Avenue. The highway also provides quick access to the city of Taguig and the Bonifacio Global City nearby. After crossing Buendia Avenue, the highway enters the Ayala Center, an important commercial district in the Philippines. The road then curves eastwards, continues on a straight route to the city of Pasay, and passing the Chino Roces Avenue, Osmeña Highway and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) through Magallanes Interchange.
EDSA enters Pasay shortly after crossing SLEX, Osmeña Highway, and Chino Roces Avenue in Makati. In Pasay, the highway provides access to Ninoy Aquino International Airport via a flyover to Tramo Street. EDSA would pass through Pasay Rotonda within Taft Avenue and continues on a straight route until it crosses to Roxas Boulevard. After crossing Roxas Boulevard, it becomes known as EDSA Extension and enters Central Business Park 1-A of the Bay City reclamation area, where SM Mall of Asia is located. EDSA&#x27;s terminus is at the Globe Rotunda fronting SM Mall of Asia.

===Bicycle lanes===

The entire span of EDSA has one-way Class II bike lanes along both sides of the road, established as part of the national government&#x27;s Metropolitan Bike Lane Network and funded by the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the bicycle lanes along EDSA are paint separated while some sections have physical separation using bollards and concrete barriers.

===Traffic management===

The lead agency that manages the flow of traffic along EDSA is the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), a government agency under the Office of the President of the Philippines and is advised by the Metro Manila Mayors League. One of the MMDA&#x27;s traffic management schemes that is in effect on EDSA, among other major thoroughfares in the metropolis, is the Uniform Vehicular Volume Reduction Program.

Many have observed that the cause of many traffic jams on EDSA is its change from being a highway to an avenue. This resulted the erection of erring establishment, buses and jeepneys. Subsequently, buses have been the target of other traffic management programs, like the MMDA&#x27;s Organized Bus Route Program. The MMDA is strictly implementing also the Motorcycle and Bus laning in EDSA, making it the second highway in the Philippines ever to have such traffic rule to be enforced, after Commonwealth Avenue. The average speed of vehicles in EDSA is .

On January 18, 2016, strict implementation on bus lanes started on the Shaw–Guadalupe segment, where plastic barriers are placed and prohibited entry of private vehicles and taxis on the bus lanes except when turning to EDSA&#x27;s side streets. Despite the plastic barrier, many private vehicles still enter the lanes.

In June 2020, bus routes in the avenue were rationalized, creating the EDSA Carousel line carried by the new EDSA Busway. The EDSA Busway is separated from normal road traffic and now used only for buses and emergency vehicles. The new bus lane spans from Monumento to PITX and is divided by concreted barriers and steel fences. The old rightmost bus lanes was now opened for all vehicles, with the avenue now having total of 4-5 public-use lanes per direction instead of 3, excluding interchanges.

==== Decongestion program ====

A decongestion program under the Build! Build! Build! Infrastructure Program is ongoing to help decongest EDSA (which is under overcapacity, carrying 402,000 vehicles daily while has the capacity of 288,000). This involves the construction of other roads and bridges that will divert traffic from the avenue. The government aims to reduce travel time from Cubao to Makati to 5–6 minutes.

==History==
Construction of what was then called the North and South Circumferential Road began in 1939 under President Manuel L. Quezon, amidst Manila&#x27;s rapid expansion. This necessitated inland growth and a planned new capital city, which became Quezon City. The construction team was led by engineers Florencio Moreno and Osmundo Munsod, integrating the former stretch of Calle Apelo Cruz from present-day Cabrera Street to Taft Avenue in Pasay and Calle Samson up to Balintawak in Quezon City to the east.

The road, starting from North Bay Boulevard in Navotas, then in the province of Rizal, and ending at Taft Avenue (formerly known as Taft Avenue Extension / Manila South Road) in Pasay, also then in Rizal, was partially opened in 1940, shortly before the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent Japanese occupation. It was then known as the Manila Circumferential Road or simply as Circumferential Road. During the war, its section in Diliman Estate served as a runway of the Quezon Airfield, along with Malawen Boulevard (now Quezon Avenue). The road was also renamed to Highway 54 and thus designated as Route 54. Due to the route number, there was a common misconception on that time that the avenue is long. The present-day North EDSA section in Caloocan and Quezon City was referred to as Calle Samson (Samson Street), while its section in Pasay was also known as P. Lovina Street. It was later renamed as McArthur Boulevard in 1945, and after the independence of the Philippines from the United States in 1946, it became known as Avenida 19 de Junio (June 19 Avenue), after the birth date of national hero José Rizal. 

In the 1950s, the northern end of the avenue was designated to its present terminus at Bonifacio Monument in Caloocan and its part west of it later becoming Samson Road, General San Miguel Street, and Letre Road. The avenue was widened from two to four lanes during this decade. Rizalists also wanted the avenue&#x27;s name to remain 19 de Junio, while President Ramon Magsaysay wanted the avenue named after Rizal. Residents of Rizal province (to which most parts of Metro Manila belonged until 1975) wanted the avenue to be named after a Rizaleño: the historian, jurist and scholar named Epifanio de los Santos y Cristóbal, who was born in Malabon. The Philippine Historical Committee (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines), the Philippine Historical Association, the Philippine Library Association, Association of university and College Professors, the Philippine China Cultural Association, and the Philippine National Historical Society, led by fellow Rizaleños Eulogio Rodriguez and Juan Sumulong, supported the renaming of Highway 54 to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue.

On April 7, 1959, de los Santos&#x27; birth anniversary, Republic Act No. 2140 was passed, renaming the avenue to honor him. Rapid urbanization in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly after the annexation of several Rizal towns to the newly established National Capital Region, marked the growth of the industrial centers along the road, and several other roads connected to the avenue, such as Ayala Avenue and McKinley Road in Makati.

Construction of EDSA continued into the 1970s, including the construction of the Guadalupe Bridge in the 1960s to connect its segments on the north and south banks of the Pasig River, with the Pasay segment being delayed due to right-of-way issues. During the rule of President Ferdinand Marcos, traffic jams along the avenue started to build up. Several interchanges were constructed to relieve congestion, including the Balintawak and Magallanes Interchanges. Later, with the implementation of the Metro Manila Arterial Road System in 1965, in order to complete the Circumferential Road 4 system, EDSA was extended from Taft Avenue to Roxas Boulevard, occupying parcels of land along the old F. Rein Street and Del Pan Avenue in Pasay. Until the mid-1980s, many parts of the highway still overlooked vast grassland and open fields.

===The EDSA Revolution===

By 1986, political opposition to the 20-year dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos mounted. In late February, high-ranking military officers including Defence Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel Ramos, defected from the Marcos government and seized Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo, two military bases located across each other midway along EDSA. This triggered three days of peaceful demonstrations that became the People Power Revolution.

The majority of protesters were gathered at the gates of the two bases, along a stretch of EDSA between the commercial districts of Cubao in Quezon City and Ortigas Center in Mandaluyong. Over two million Filipino civilians, along with political, military, and religious groups led by Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Jaime Sin, succeeded in toppling President Marcos. Corazon Aquino, the widow of assassinated opposition senator Benigno Aquino Jr., was installed as president on the morning of February 25; by midnight, Marcos had escaped Malacañang Palace with his family, and was flying to exile in Hawaii.

===Monuments===
Several landmarks commemorate historical events that occurred along the avenue. At the intersection of EDSA and Ortigas Avenue is EDSA Shrine, a Catholic church capped by a bronze statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Peace. The shrine is dedicated to this Marian title in memory of the pious folk belief that in the 1986 Revolution, the Virgin Mary personally shielded the protesters – many of whom were peacefully praying and singing – as they faced government troops, tanks, and aircraft.

The People Power Monument (), consisting of a giant statue and esplanade, sits at the corner of EDSA and White Plains Avenue. Sculpted by Eduardo Castrillo and unveiled in 1993, the central sculpture depicts protesters standing upon a circular podium, all surrounding a woman (representing &quot;Ináng Bayan&quot; or the Motherland), reaching up to the heavens with her outstretched hands and broken shackles. A Philippine flag rises behind her, while a statue of Ninoy Aquino and an eternal flame stand on either side at its base. A huge, limestone-faced wall with grooves for ribbons in the national colors forms a backdrop to the scene. The surrounding pavement contains a row of flagstaffs, and is the center for protests and ceremonies held on the Revolution&#x27;s anniversary of February 25.

Monuments dedicated to Andrés Bonifacio are situated at two locations along EDSA: the Balintawak Interchange and the avenue&#x27;s terminus, the Monumento Circle. The monument at Balintawak, erected in 1971, replaced the old Cry of Balintawak Monument, a monument commemorating the Cry of Pugad Lawin and was transferred to the University of the Philippines Diliman campus in 1968. On the other hand, the Bonifacio Monument at Monumento was built in 1929 and unveiled in 1933.

===Recent history===

After the People Power Revolution, the highway was commonly referred to as EDSA, and it was connected to its southern extensions.

In 1997, construction began on the Manila Metro Rail Transit System, which runs the length of EDSA from North Avenue to Taft Avenue. It was opened under the administration of Joseph Estrada, the thirteenth President of the Philippines.

The Second EDSA Revolution, which also took place along the avenue, resulted in the peaceful ouster of President Estrada following his impeachment trial. He was succeeded by his Vice-President, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. She was sworn in on the terrace of EDSA Shrine by then-Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. at noon on January 20, 2001, several hours before Estrada and his family fled Malacañang Palace.

The EDSA III, which also took place along the avenue from April 25 to May 1 of the same year, resulted in violence when the supporters of former President Estrada attempted to storm the presidential palace and the military and police were ordered to use their arms to drive them back. Arroyo declared a state of rebellion because of the violence and prominent political personalities affiliated with Estrada were charged and arrested.

In 2006, the avenue was further extended from Roxas Boulevard to the SM Mall of Asia on the Bay City Reclamation Project, where it now ends at the Globe Rotunda, a roundabout. That same year, the avenue was badly damaged in September, when Typhoon Milenyo hit Manila.

In 2010, the LRT Line 1 (LRT-1) of the Manila Light Rail Transit System was extended from Monumento to Roosevelt (now Fernando Poe Jr.), ultimately transversing EDSA to end at the site of the current North Avenue MRT station.

On September 9, 2015, the Philippine National Police (PNP) deployed the Highway Patrol Group to support MMDA traffic constables easing traffic on congested segments of EDSA.

In September 2017, the construction of the North Triangle Common Station was started after numerous delays due to bureaucracy and location disputes. It will connect the LRT Line 1, MRT Line 3, MRT Line 7, and the Metro Manila Subway.

==EDSA Carousel==
The EDSA Carousel is a bus rapid transit (BRT) system with stops mostly on the EDSA median lanes serving as the main bus route of the avenue. The system was put into place after almost all public and private transportation along EDSA was prohibited during the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon imposed during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Interim operations of the BRT system began on July 1, 2020. Intended to be largely served by bus stops along some stops are temporarily served by stations on the curbside. The system runs on a dedicated bus lane called the EDSA Busway, which is separated by concreted barriers.

Prior to the establishment of the EDSA Carousel, the Department of Transportation proposed in 2017 to create two BRT lines in Metro Manila, which would be part of a Metro Manila Bus Rapid Transit System. EDSA would have had been designated as &quot;Line 2: Central Corridor&quot; and would have had of segregated busways covering the length of the road. The agency planned to scrap the project by June 2018. However, this appeal was rejected and the Line 1 which will be built on Quezon Avenue, which passes EDSA, was later approved by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on November 2, 2018. 

In 2019, Senator Win Gatchalian called for the approval of the BRT system as an alternate mode of transportation to the PNR Metro Commuter Line.

==Future developments==
===Proposed interchanges===
An overpass over the North Avenue–West Avenue Intersection and Mindanao Avenue Junction in the Triangle Park and a flyover over Congressional Avenue–Fernando Poe Jr. Avenue intersection in Muñoz are already approved and was slated to begin construction construction in 2013. As of 2020, the project is currently on hold.

===Proposed renaming===
On October 13, 2011, Representative Rene Relampagos (Bohol–1st) filed House Bill (HB) No. 5422, proposing to rename Epifanio de los Santos Avenue as &quot;Corazon Aquino Avenue.&quot; According to Relampagos, the idea to rename EDSA after Aquino, who led the 1986 People Power, was conceptualized in the aftermath of her death. However, the measure only went as far as referral to the House Committee on Public Works and Highways on November 14, 2011.

===Construction of EDSA-Taft flyover===

On April 2, 2013, then-President Benigno Aquino III gave the go-signal for the construction of a flyover at the perennially traffic-choked corner of EDSA and Taft Avenue in Pasay.

The project is estimated to cost , with the flyover extending to about each side and it will take one and a half years to complete the project.

===Barrier-separated bus lanes===
After stricter implementation of bus lanes and barrier separation through plastic barriers, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) started to replace the orange barriers with a concrete permanent barrier used to separate the bus lanes from private vehicle lanes.

===Proposed road pricing scheme===
With support from Singapore, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority proposed the implementation of congestion pricing, based on the Electronic Road Pricing scheme on Singapore, on EDSA to alleviate traffic congestion, along with providing alternate routes and opening some gated community roads. Implementation is set for 2018, but Rene Santiago, a transport engineer and planner, criticized the proposal because it may only worsen congestion, along with the numerous intersections and side streets along EDSA.

The congestion pricing proposal was revived again in 2025 by the MMDA, believing that improvements and projected capacity increases in the MRT-3 would allow them to more feasibly introduce congestion pricing and high-occupancy vehicle lanes.

===Proposed shared bicycle-motorcycle lanes===
On August 18, 2023, the MMDA proposed converting the bicycle lanes on EDSA exclusive to bicycles into shared lanes for bicycles and motorcycles, claiming that the EDSA bicycle lanes are &quot;underutilized&quot;, and also proposed plans to build an elevated walkway and bikeway on EDSA from Guadalupe to Cubao. A preliminary feasibility study will be conducted within the week, with a stakeholders&#x27; meeting with cyclists and motorcycle riders taking place on August 29, 2023.

The proposal was criticized by sustainable transport advocates, who claimed that the proposed scheme would compromise the safety of cyclists and argued instead to carve an exclusive motorcycle lane from the regular lanes. The Department of Transportation will have the final say on the MMDA&#x27;s proposal, which has jurisdiction over the EDSA bicycle lanes.

The MMDA, together with the DILG, revived its proposal for shared bicycle and motorcycle lanes again in 2025, with the latter citing the need for a dedicated motorcycle lane.

==Protests==
EDSA is frequently used as a protest site. In August 2012, the Catholic Church assembled a mass rally on EDSA to oppose the Reproductive Health Bill. On September 11, 2013, a prayer vigil called &quot;EDSA Tayo&quot; was held at the EDSA Shrine, where around 500–700 people were gathered to call for the abolition of the Priority Development Assistance Fund. On February 25, 2015, various groups held a demonstration along EDSA to demand that President Benigno Aquino III stand down. On August 27–31 of the same year, adherents staged demonstrations along EDSA near SM Megamall, calling on then-Justice Secretary Leila De Lima to focus on issues such as the Mamasapano clash instead of a case filed by former INC minister Isaias Samson Jr., against Church leaders. On November 30, 2016, an anti-Marcos protest was held in the People Power Monument due to the burial of Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. On November 5, 2017, critics of the Duterte administration attended a mass held in EDSA shrine to protest against extrajudicial killings in the country. On February 22, 2018, groups gathered at People Power Monument to hold a prayer vigil to show their opposition against constitutional reform. On February 22, 2020, demonstrators gathered at the People Power Monument to call on President Rodrigo Duterte to resign from office.

The avenue is also used in political campaigns by several politicians, particularly those who had been involved in the EDSA Revolution such as Joseph Estrada and Benigno Aquino III.

==In popular culture==
EDSA was also featured in the film &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot;. Portions of the road from Magallanes Interchange to Taft Avenue were featured in a car chase wherein Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, jumps from the Taft Avenue footbridge to a plying bus.

Due to its notorious traffic congestion, &quot;Programang EDSA&quot;, a weekday rush hour radio program airing on 90.7 Love Radio Manila in the early evening, is named after the avenue.
Pablo of SB19 wrote and performed the song &quot;EDSA&quot; that describes the experience of driving along this avenue especially during rush hour.

<doc id="456405" wikidata="Q1388488" url="?curid=456405" title="Noel Edmonds">
<text>Noel Ernest Edmonds (born 22 December 1948) is an English television presenter, radio DJ, writer, producer, and businessman. Edmonds first became known as a disc jockey on Radio Luxembourg before moving to BBC Radio 1 in the UK, presenting the breakfast show for almost five years. He has presented various radio shows and light-entertainment television programmes for over 50 years, originally working for the BBC and later Sky UK and Channel 4.

After presenting children&#x27;s Saturday-morning programme &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot; (1976–1982) and various other BBC TV shows like &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Top Gear&quot; during the 1970s, he became best known for presenting &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; on BBC One from 1991 to 1999. The show achieved 15 million viewers at its peak and originated the character Mr Blobby. He also presented the BBC TV shows &quot;Noel&#x27;s Christmas Presents&quot; (1989-1999) and &quot;Telly Addicts&quot; (1985-1998). Following a hiatus from broadcasting, Edmonds presented the game show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; on Channel 4 from 2005 to 2016.

==Early life==
Edmonds was born in Ilford, Essex, the son of Dudley Edmonds, a headmaster who worked in Hainault, Chigwell, and Lydia Edmonds, an art teacher. He attended Glade Primary School in Clayhall and Brentwood School in Brentwood, Essex.

He was offered a place at the University of Surrey but turned it down to focus on his radio career.

==Radio career==
Edmonds began working as a newsreader on Radio Luxembourg, which was offered to him in 1968 after he sent tapes to offshore radio stations.

In 1969, Edmonds moved to BBC Radio 1, where he began by recording trailers for broadcasts and filling in for absent DJs, such as Kenny Everett. In April 1970, he began his own two-hour Saturday-afternoon programme, broadcasting from 1to 3p.m., before replacing Everett on Saturdays from 10a.m. to noon in July that year. In October 1971, he was moved to a Sunday slot from 10a.m. to noon before being promoted to host &quot;The Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot; from Monday 4 June 1973 to Friday 28 April 1978, taking over from Tony Blackburn. Edmonds moved to Sunday mornings and middays, from 10a.m. to 1p.m., in 1978 and also presented &quot;Talkabout&quot;, an hour-long talk show broadcast on Thursday evenings. Edmonds left Radio 1 in March 1983.

Edmonds made two temporary returns to Radio 1: in 1985, when he sat in for Mike Read hosting the breakfast show, and in 1992 to celebrate Radio 1&#x27;s 25th birthday.

In 2003, Edmonds made a brief radio comeback, taking over the drivetime broadcast on BBC Radio 2 for eight weeks while Johnnie Walker was treated for cancer. His stint on Radio 2 lasted from 4 August until 3 October. In December 2004, Edmonds played a detective on a radio murder mystery play on local station BBC Radio Devon.

In 2020, Edmonds set up an online radio network in New Zealand, called Positivity Radio.

==Television career==

Edmonds hosted &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; at various points between 1972 and 1978, during which time he also presented a phone-in programme for teenagers called &quot;Z Shed&quot; on BBC1 as well as a programme called &quot;Hobby Horse&quot;. He hosted the children&#x27;s Saturday-morning programme &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot;, which ran from 1976 to 1982. With fellow &quot;Swap Shop&quot; regulars Maggie Philbin and Keith Chegwin, Edmonds was a member of the trio Brown Sauce, which recorded the single &quot;I Wanna Be a Winner&quot; in 1981. It reached number 15 in the UK singles chart. In 1980, Edmonds took part in the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot;, introducing the UK entry live on stage at the final in the Hague. During &quot;Swap Shop&quot;&#x27;s run Edmonds hosted &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot;, a Saturday evening phone-in quiz programme which required viewers to call in and answer questions based on clips of films shown, and a revival of the 1960s pop music series &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;.

Edmonds was one of the original presenters of the BBC&#x27;s motoring series &quot;Top Gear&quot; during the late 1970s. During his time on the programme he mocked the Fiat Strada, saying it &quot;wasn&#x27;t very good&quot;, which caused Fiat to threaten to sue the BBC unless he apologised for the comments. Edmonds reappeared in one episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; in the 1990s, to road test the classic 1960s Ford GT40 supercar, of which he owned two, because the host Jeremy Clarkson – at tall – was unable to fit into the cockpit. In 1997 Clarkson was one of Edmonds&#x27; star team for the 1997 Le Mans race which was featured in &quot;Noel&#x27;s Le Mans Dream&quot;, a two-part documentary for BBC 2. In the 1980s Edmonds hosted a series on BBC1 called &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;, in which celebrities recalled the time they were at their happiest professionally. It ran for three series from 1983.

===&quot;The Late Late Breakfast Show&quot;===

&quot;The Late Late Breakfast Show&quot; was Edmonds&#x27; first Saturday-evening light-entertainment show on the BBC. Presented by Edmonds live on Saturday evenings from 4 September 1982 to 8 November 1986, initially with co-host Leni Harper. It also featured Mike Smith and John Peel.
The programme is remembered for several accidents during its regular &quot;Give it a Whirl&quot; stunt slot; in particular the death of Michael Lush. The show was cancelled by the BBC on 15 November 1986, following Lush&#x27;s death two days earlier. While rehearsing a bungee jump to be performed live on the show, Michael Lush plunged to his death when his rope came loose. Edmonds resigned from the BBC immediately afterwards.

===&quot;Telly Addicts&quot;===

&quot;Telly Addicts&quot; was a BBC1 game show hosted by Edmonds, who also owned the format. &quot;Telly Addicts&quot; broadcast for 13 years from 3 September 1985 until 29 July 1998. Questions were based on past and present television programmes, and generally took the form of a short clip being shown followed by a series of questions either specifically about the clip or more generally about the programme from which it had been taken. Two teams sat opposite each other on sofas.

In 1991 he presented a prime time series called &quot;Noel&#x27;s Addicts&quot;, but this show had no similarity to the &quot;Telly Addicts&quot; format and only ran for one series.

===&quot;Noel&#x27;s Saturday Roadshow&quot;===

&quot;Noel&#x27;s Saturday Roadshow&quot; was Edmonds&#x27;s second BBC television light entertainment show, broadcast on Saturday evenings from 3 September 1988 to 15 December 1990.
Presented by Edmonds, it was his first major TV project since the demise of &quot;The Late, Late Breakfast Show&quot; two years earlier. The programme contained several elements found in its predecessor, such as phone-in quizzes, celebrity interviews and bands performing in the studio. The premise for the new show was that unlike &quot;The Late Late Breakfast Show&quot;, which had been broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s studios each week, the Roadshow would come from a new, different and exotic location each week. These &quot;locations&quot; were in fact elaborate studio sets dressed to resemble each week&#x27;s location, such as the North Pole, a space station, Hollywood, Niagara Falls. The irony of this was not lost on Edmonds, whose self-deprecating presentation style frequently made light of the low-budget production values.

The programme was a slow-burning success and, following the third series in 1990, Edmonds&#x27;s popularity and reputation were sufficiently re-established with the public for him to pitch his idea for &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; to the BBC.

The show introduced regular features such as the Gunge Tank, the Gotcha Oscars and Wait &#x27;Til I Get You Home, which would all be carried across and subsequently developed in &quot;House Party&quot;. Another item was Clown Court, in which a guest actor from a TV series would be on trial for all the bloopers made during the shooting of that show, for example Sylvester McCoy for the title role of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and Tony Robinson for his character of Baldrick in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;.

===&quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;===

By 1991, the &quot;Saturday Roadshow&quot; morphed into &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, which ran for eight years, from Edmonds&#x27; mansion in the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom. Regular features included NTV, in which cameras were secretly hidden in viewers&#x27; homes, often in VHS tape cases. There was also the &quot;Gotchas&quot;, with celebrities caught in elaborate and embarrassing set-up situations.

In one incident NTV&#x27;s hidden cameras caught celebrity psychic Uri Geller apparently bending a spoon with his hands while demonstrating his &quot;powers&quot; to a member of the public. When then-Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was &quot;Gotcha&#x27;d&quot; live on Radio 1, he infamously yelled &quot;Edmonds, you are a dead man!&quot; He later participated when Edmonds himself was &quot;Gotcha&#x27;d&quot;. Mr Blobby, a pink and yellow spotted character, initially appeared in the &quot;Gotcha&quot; section, and became a regular feature of the programme. The character even achieved the 1993 Christmas No. 1.

&quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; was a staple of BBC1&#x27;s autumn and spring schedules throughout the 1990s. The show regularly attracted audiences of over 15 million but along with the general decline in the traditional Saturday night ratings by the time it ended it was pulling in less than 8 million. In the final programme, broadcast on 20 March 1999, Edmonds signed off with thanks to the audience and the wish that history would be kind to the programme.

===&quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;===
In 2005, Edmonds was persuaded back to TV presentation by Peter Bazalgette, then CEO of Endemol, which was experiencing great success with its new game show format of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. Edmonds initially declined the approach, citing that he was concentrating on business interests, but eventually agreed to host a short run of 66 shows. The programme was initially recorded at Paintworks in Bristol but later moved to a dedicated studio in The Bottle Yard Studios in 2014. &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; began UK transmission on 31 October 2005, and was broadcast on afternoons, and occasionally evenings, six days a week. In March 2006 Edmonds had his contract for presenting &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; extended until autumn 2007, for a fee rumoured to be £3 million, making him one of the highest-paid personalities on UK television. In 2006, Edmonds was nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for his work on the programme but lost out on the night to Jonathan Ross.

On 16 March 2007, Edmonds made a cameo appearance as himself in a sketch with Catherine Tate who appeared in the guise of her character Joanie &quot;Nan&quot; Taylor from &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;. Nan appeared on a special episode of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, where she ended up cheating. The sketch was made for the BBC Red Nose Day fundraising programme of 2007.

&quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; ran for 11 years and almost 3,000 shows were recorded, with over £40m being given away during its run. Celebrity specials were aired sporadically between 2012 and 2015. In the summer of 2016 by mutual agreement Edmonds and Channel 4 agreed to end the show. In celebration of one of UK TV&#x27;s longest and most popular gameshow runs, the final shows were recorded on location. Games were filmed on a Boeing 737, the Flying Scotsman, atop the Blackpool Tower and down a cave in Somerset.

===Work with Sky===

On 24 May 2007, Sky One announced that Edmonds would host the UK version of the American hit &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot;, titled &quot;Are You Smarter than a 10 Year Old?&quot;. The programme made its debut on Sky One on 7 October 2007. Edmonds hosted the peak-time showing of the programme, with the daily programme being presented by Dick &amp; Dom.

Sky1&#x27;s autumn 2008 season saw Edmonds host &quot;Noel&#x27;s HQ&quot;, a new live entertainment show with a philanthropic purpose, his fees going to a charitable trust. This was later developed into a series. The show received a negative review from &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Sky edited a repeat broadcast after Edmonds launched an extended verbal attack on a council press officer. In March 2009, Sky1 announced the cancellation of the show.

===Other television appearances===

Edmonds has hosted major TV events including the BAFTA Awards, the Brit Awards and the launch of the UK National Lottery. Edmonds was involved in the Live Aid concerts in 1985, transporting stars to and from the Wembley Stadium concert via helicopter and appearing on stage at Wembley to introduce the joint set by Sting and Phil Collins. Edmonds also took Collins to Heathrow Airport, where Collins boarded Concorde to fly to the United States to perform at the Philadelphia concert.

&quot;Noel&#x27;s Christmas Presents&quot; was an annual broadcast in which Edmonds delivered special presents to special people. Some of the gifts included arranging trips to Lapland for ill or disadvantaged children, or arranging family reunions. &quot;Noel&#x27;s Christmas Presents&quot; was originally broadcast on BBC One on Christmas Day from 1989 until 1999 (except 1992), before it returned to UK screens courtesy of Sky1 on 23 December 2007. Further editions were screened on 21 December 2008, 20 December 2009, 18 December 2010 and 18 December 2011.

In 1997 Edmonds was involved in an episode of the Chris Morris spoof documentary series &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, in which he unwittingly pledged his allegiance on camera to a campaign to rid the country of a new killer drug, the entirely fictitious &quot;cake&quot;, which apparently made 10 seconds appear as a few hours to a user by stimulating part of the brain called Shatner&#x27;s Bassoon. Edmonds was also a guest host for the fourth-series episode of &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot;, broadcast on 26 January 2007. In 2014 he appeared in BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot; as himself.

In 2017 Edmonds presented &quot;Cheap Cheap Cheap&quot;, a cross between a sitcom and a game show. Edmonds came up with the concept, produced by Hat Trick and Channel 4 commissioned 30 episodes, each an hour long. The action took place in &#x27;Noel&#x27;s Store&#x27; and according to the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, &quot;contestants are presented with three similar items – be it laundry detergent, noodles, baked beans, coffins, live poultry or lottery tickets – and must identify the cheapest one of the three in order to win money.&quot; A cast of actors play workers at the store. Stuart Heritage of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that &quot;It&#x27;s like watching a weird piece of existential Lithuanian amateur community theatre [...] It&#x27;s the worst idea in the world, stretched out for all eternity&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s Ed Power described it as &quot;naff, tacky and numbingly dull&quot; and &quot;mind-bendingly outlandish&quot;.

&quot;The Curse of Noel Edmonds&quot;, a documentary tracing the rise and fall of his showbiz career, was transmitted by Five on 9 November 2004, with former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read being one of the contributors to the programme. On 27 August 2022, Edmonds was the subject of an in-depth documentary on Channel 5, titled &quot;Noel Edmonds: The Rise &amp; Fall of Mr. Saturday Night&quot;. The show documented the highs and lows of Edmonds&#x27; career to date.

====&quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;====

In November 2018, Edmonds participated in the eighteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. Edmonds&#x27; appearance fee of £600,000 made him the highest paid participant ever in the show&#x27;s history up to that date.

He was the first celebrity to leave the series when he was voted out on 30 November 2018. Many fans of the show were surprised by the departure, with &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot; host Greg James described as &quot;furious and sad&quot;.

==Business ventures==
===Unique Group===
In 1985, Edmonds formed the Unique Group, which consisted of various operations. The Unique Broadcasting Company Media Group plc (UBCMG) was an independent producer of audio programming in the UK, supplying BBC and independent radio. Michael Peacock was an executive of the group between 1989 and 2005, and former Radio 1 controller Johnny Beerling joined the group following his departure from the network in 1993. It owned Classic Gold Digital before selling the stations back to GCap Media which merged them into the Gold network. Edmonds resigned as non-executive director of UBCMG in March 2006 as a direct result of the success of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. As of 2006, Edmonds also had interests in Unique Motor Company, a producer of small off-road vehicles, including the Qpod.

In July 2019, Edmonds agreed to a compensation deal with Lloyds Banking Group as a victim of the HBOS Reading branch fraud. He had claimed that bank staff had destroyed Unique Group.

===Theme parks===

Edmonds-licensed theme park attractions based on Crinkley Bottom and Mr Blobby were set up in existing parks at Cricket St Thomas in Somerset and Pleasurewood Hills Theme Park in Lowestoft, Suffolk. A park was also built in Morecambe, Lancashire, on the site of the former Happy Mount Park. Following disappointing visitor numbers, and in the case of Morecambe, legal disputes with the local council, the deal was scrapped and the park closed. The two existing parks reverted to their previous state. Edmonds was said to be very critical of Lancaster city council&#x27;s management of the Morecambe park.

A report by the district auditor found that the council had behaved &#x27;unlawfully&#x27; in its dealings with Edmonds, which cost £2.5m, and two former senior officers were found to have committed &#x27;misconduct&#x27;, although this was not deemed to be &#x27;wilful&#x27;. The affair was dubbed &#x27;Blobbygate&#x27; by the media.

===Buying the BBC===
In March 2014, Edmonds declared on &quot;Newsnight&quot; that he was part of a consortium which planned to buy the BBC, because the corporation was &quot;sleepwalking itself to destruction&quot;. He said that he did not have a TV licence and only watched BBC programmes on catch-up.

==Personal life==
Edmonds married Gillian Slater in 1971. The marriage ended in divorce after 11 years. From July 1986 to 2005, he was married to Helen Soby; the couple have four daughters. In July 2009, Edmonds married his third wife, Liz Davies, who was a make-up artist on the programme &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; when they first met.

Edmonds is a licensed helicopter pilot, and one of his early personal aircraft was registered G-NOEL. He was president of the British Horse Society between 2004 and 2007.

On 27 September 2015, Edmonds received an award from the Atlantic Award Group for his extensive contributions to broadcasting. The selection process was initiated by a nomination by a viewer of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. Edmonds was the first TV personality to receive an award from the AAG and was also the first recipient from the UK in 2015.

In June 2017 Edmonds said he had attempted suicide in 2005, after fraud by a group of HBOS financiers destroyed his Unique Group business: &quot;Until these criminals took me to the brink of emotional annihilation, I had always felt those who opt out by taking their own lives were selfish and cowardly... But having been cast into that bottomless dark space devoid of logic and reason, I have a much deeper understanding of life without hope... I seek no sympathy and feel no shame in admitting that on the evening of January 18th 2005 I attempted to end the overwhelming mental pain which had consumed my whole being.&quot; In September 2017, Edmonds said there was a direct link between fraudulent HBOS financiers causing stress and his prostate cancer. He stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t say cancer was caused by the stress, but that my health deteriorated to such an extent I got prostate cancer. I am absolutely sure the negative forces acting on me impacted on my health. There is a wealth of information from various clinical studies of a direct link between stress and cancer. I am absolutely certain there was a link in my case.&quot;

Edmonds and his wife decided to move to New Zealand in 2015 and eventually emigrated in 2019; during the COVID lockdown he set up 100 online community radio stations called Positivity Radio. He currently lives in Ngātīmoti, in the South Island, with his wife, having gained residency permission in February 2020. Living in the country since the previous September, Edmonds said he and his wife had felt an &quot;incredible spiritual pull&quot; on a visit in 2016, leading them to settle in the country.

Edmonds is fond of referring to himself in the third person.

===Political views===
Edmonds was chairman of the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF), an organisation which is staunchly opposed to wind farms. He was said to have joined &quot;because of the threat near his home in Devon&quot;. He has been quoted as saying that, &quot;Politicians are promoting the wind industry as a green icon, but they are misleading the public into believing the propaganda of the wind industry. The reality is that wind power is too costly and can never meet our energy needs; but it will destroy the countryside&quot;. His view is that those who are promoting wind farms are energy companies with a vested financial interest, and that wind turbines are not reliable enough as a source of sustainable energy.

Edmonds is an outspoken critic of immigration and the BBC&#x27;s Welsh language service.

He coordinated the Heart of Devon campaign to provide information for farmers affected by the foot and mouth epidemic in 2001.

===TV licence boycott===
Edmonds said that he had stopped payment on his TV licence in early 2008, in response to the sometimes controversial methods used to enforce collection of the TV licence fee. Edmonds said that it is wrong to &quot;threaten&quot; and &quot;badger&quot; people, in response to the collection authority&#x27;s common assumption that the non-possession of a licence can mean licence evasion, as well as the large fines which can be used as enforcement for non-payment. TV Licensing later claimed that Edmonds did possess a valid current TV licence, but this claim was denied by a spokesman for Edmonds.

===Spiritualism===
For many years, Edmonds has been a believer in spiritualism, in particular the concept of cosmic ordering, a subject he became interested in after being introduced to Bärbel Mohr&#x27;s book &quot;The Cosmic Ordering Service – A Guide to Realising Your Dreams&quot; by his reflexologist. He had not worked on TV since the end of his BBC TV show &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; in 1999 and one of his wishes was for a new challenge. Later he was offered the chance to return to TV to work on &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. Edmonds later went on to write his own book titled &quot;Positively Happy: Cosmic Ways To Change Your Life&quot;.

Edmonds said in 2008 that he is constantly accompanied by two melon-sized &quot;spiritual energy&quot; balls, which appear over his shoulders and which he believes to be the spirits of his dead parents. &quot;Orbs are little bundles of positive energy and they think they can move between 500 and 1,000 miles per hour,&quot; according to Edmonds. &quot;They look like little round planets but they come in all shapes and sizes.&quot; He has asserted that the orbs appear only on digital photographs.

In August 2015, Edmonds gave an interview to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in which he stated that the greatest problem facing humanity was &quot;electrosmog&quot; due to Wi-Fi and other &quot;systems&quot;, causing the destruction of &quot;our natural electro-magnetic fields&quot;. He also stated a belief that death was impossible because the body was merely a container for &quot;a universal energy&quot;, and that this had &quot;been known for a very long time&quot;. When he dies, Edmonds anticipates that &quot;My energy will return to where it came from – part of a massive, incomprehensible universal web of energy&quot;.

===EMP Pad===
On 7 June 2016, Edmonds said on Twitter that an electromagnetic pulse device costing £2,315 was &quot;A simple box that slows ageing, reduces pain, lifts depression and stress and tackles cancer. Yep tackles cancer!&quot;. Edmonds provoked further criticism after tweeting to a man with kidney cancer, lymph node metastases and psoriatic arthritis that &quot;Scientific fact-disease is caused by negative energy. Is it possible your ill health is caused by your negative attitude? #explore.&quot; The following day, Edmonds was interviewed by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; television programme stating that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in November 2013. He said that a &quot;very stressful, very negative period&quot; in life had caused his prostate cancer, &quot;I was, I thought, very, very healthy. I know why I got my cancer... the definition of stress is negative energy. It didn&#x27;t just decide to manifest itself, there was cause&quot;. He went on to add: &quot;I then had my tumour destroyed by sound waves, proving yet again energy is at the heart of this issue&quot; and said that &quot;I believe pulsed electromagnetism has a role to play in tackling cancer and I will always believe that&quot;.

In response, the firm responsible for the device, EMP Pad Limited, said it did not agree with his claim &quot;in any way, shape or form&quot;, and that it had not paid him in relation to it. While EMP Pad said it did not pay Edmonds to promote the product, the company&#x27;s owner Maria Robertson, previously worked as an assistant to the TV presenter and acknowledged having known Edmonds for 25 years and having worked with him and his daughter. Cancer Research UK produced an article to reassure the public that &quot;the best studies looking at this topic have failed to show a link between emotional stress and an increased risk of cancer&quot; and that &quot;no reliable evidence has ever been produced that Rife machines – or any similar devices producing low-frequency electromagnetic pulses – have any benefit for cancer patients. Nor have organisations that scrutinise new treatments and devices (like the US Food and Drug Authority or the European Medicines Agency) approved any as a therapy for any type of disease&quot;.

David Grimes, a cancer researcher at the University of Oxford, told &quot;This Morning&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not just untrue, it&#x27;s patronising and victim blaming, cancer is bad luck... the healthiest people in the world get cancer and it&#x27;s not because they are negative&quot;. Prof. John Gribben, chair of medical oncology at Queen Mary University of London, said: &quot;This is complete gibberish and undermines all the good work everyone does with evidence-based medicine and targeted approaches&quot;. Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor at the University of Exeter said: &quot;The reason why most of us put &#x27;negative energy&#x27; in inverted commas is simple: it is a pure figment of the imagination of fantasists. That would not be so bad except that, as we see, some VIPs seem to take this nonsense seriously. The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.&quot;

In 2016 the UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority said that it was &quot;urgently looking into&quot; a complaint made over the claims, because advertising any proven or unproven cancer treatment would violate the Cancer Act 1939 if payments had been made. Later the ASA said that no rules had been broken. The same year the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said that it was investigating the products available from EMP Pad &quot;to determine whether there are any breaches of the Medical Device Regulations 2002&quot;.

===Dispute with Lloyds Bank===
A major turning point for Edmonds was the 2005 collapse of his entertainment company Unique Group – an umbrella for various production companies that owned the rights to, among other things, &quot;Mr Blobby&quot; and &quot;Telly Addicts&quot;. Edmonds held Lloyds Bank responsible, because it had acquired HBOS, whose Reading branch was involved in the alleged scam. Edmonds sought £60m in losses and damages. Edmonds complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the &quot;By Your Side&quot; Lloyds marketing campaign, claiming it was hypocritical; the complaint was not upheld. In 2017, the HBOS bankers and others involved in the scam were found guilty of committing fraud and jailed. In 2019 it was reported that the dispute was settled, with Lloyds Bank Group agreeing a compensation deal with Edmonds, and apologising to him for the &quot;distress&quot; he had suffered.

<text>Yale Law School (YLS) is the law school of Yale University, a private research university in New Haven, Connecticut. It was established in 1824. The 2020–21 acceptance rate was 4%, the lowest of any law school in the United States. Its yield rate is often the highest of any law school in the United States. 

Each class in Yale Law&#x27;s three-year J.D. program enrolls approximately 200 students. Yale&#x27;s flagship law review is the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, one of the most highly cited legal publications in the United States. According to Yale Law School&#x27;s ABA-required disclosures, 83% of the Class of 2019 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required or JD-advantage employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners.

Yale Law alumni include many prominent figures in law and politics, including U.S. presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton, U.S. vice president JD Vance, U.S. secretaries of state Cyrus Vance and Hillary Clinton, U.S. secretaries of the treasury Henry H. Fowler and Robert Rubin, and nine U.S. attorneys general. Other alumni also include current U.S. Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Brett Kavanaugh, as well as multiple former justices, including Abe Fortas, Potter Stewart and Byron White; several heads of state, including German president Karl Carstens, Philippine president Jose P. Laurel, and Malawi president Peter Mutharika; U.S. senators, governors, and officials; and the current deans of three of the top fourteen-ranked law schools in the United States: Penn, Northwestern, and Georgetown.

== History ==

=== Early days ===
The school began in the New Haven law office of Seth P. Staples in the 1800s, who began training lawyers. By 1810 he was operating a law school. He took on a former student, Samuel J. Hitchcock as a law partner, and Hitchcock became the proprietor of the New Haven Law School, joined by David Daggett in 1824. The Yale Law School shield (shown at the upper right of this page) shows staples and a rampant dog, representing Seth Staples and David Daggett. The school&#x27;s affiliation with Yale began in the mid-1820s and in 1843, the school&#x27;s students began receiving Yale degrees.

Daggett went on to serve as mayor of New Haven, U.S. Senator, and judge on Connecticut&#x27;s highest court. An opponent of education for African Americans and a supporter of colonization, he helped lead opposition to the establishment of a college for African Americans in New Haven and presided over the trial of a woman who ran a boarding school for African American girls.

=== 20th century ===
A special relationship or connection developed between YLS and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Professors Clark and Frank, among others, became judges on that court. Some of the faculty members who became Second Circuit judges continued to teach courses at YLS and chose their clerks from student graduates. These judges influenced thinking in general at YLS and particularly reinforced student interest in public service, a characteristic tradition at YLS since the New Deal.

=== 21st century ===
The law school&#x27;s 15th dean, Harold Koh (2004–2009), made human rights a focus of the law school&#x27;s work, building on a tradition that had developed over the previous two decades. On March 23, 2009, the White House announced the appointment of Koh to the United States Department of State as the Legal Adviser of the Department of State. Robert C. Post was selected to replace him as dean of the law school.

In 2022, two federal appeals judges, James C. Ho and Elizabeth L. Branch, stopped hiring Yale Law graduates as clerks because of concerns the school suppresses conservative views. The school responded by initiating actions to &quot;reaffirm its commitment to free speech&quot;, which included an orientation about &quot;free expression&quot; and &quot;respectful engagement&quot;, the appointment of a new dean to help law students &quot;resolve disagreements&quot;, and a prohibition on secret recordings and disruption of campus events.

== Academics ==
=== Culture ===
The institution is known for its scholarly orientation; a relatively large number of its graduates (9%) choose careers in academia within five years of graduation, while a relatively low number (46%) choose to work in law firms five years after graduation. Another feature of Yale Law&#x27;s culture since the 1930s, among both faculty and student graduates, has been an emphasis on the importance of spending at least a few years in government service. A similar emphasis has long been placed on service as a judicial law clerk upon graduation. Its 4.5:1 student-to-faculty ratio is the lowest among U.S. law schools.

Yale Law does not have a traditional grading system, a consequence of student unrest in the late 1960s. Instead, it grades first-semester first-year students on a simple Credit/No Credit system. For their remaining two-and-a-half years, students are graded on an Honors/Pass/Low Pass/Fail system. Similarly, the school does not rank its students. It is also notable for having only a single semester of required classes (plus two additional writing requirements), instead of the full year most U.S. schools require. Unusually, and as a result of unique Connecticut State court rules, Yale Law allows first-year students to represent clients through one of its numerous clinics; other law schools typically offer this opportunity only to second- and third-year students.

Students publish nine law journals that, unlike those at most other schools, mostly accept student editors without a competition. The only exception is YLS&#x27;s flagship journal, the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, which holds a two-part admissions competition each spring, consisting of a four- or five-hour &quot;bluebooking exam,&quot; followed by a traditional writing competition. Although the &quot;Journal&quot; identifies a target maximum number of members to accept each year, it is not a firm number. Other leading student-edited publications include the &quot;Yale Journal on Regulation&quot;, the &quot;Yale Law &amp; Policy Review&quot;, and the &quot;Yale Journal of International Law&quot;.

In November 2013, it was announced that a $25 million donation would bring student dormitory living back onto campus, with renovations to begin in 2018.

=== Rankings ===
Since 2020, Yale Law School has held the top spot as the world’s best law school, according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU). Yale Law has been ranked the number one law school in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; between 1990 and 2024. Among U.S. law schools, Yale has the lowest acceptance rate and the highest yield rate—whereas less than 5% of applicants are admitted, about 80% of those who are accepted ultimately enroll, either in the Fall following their acceptance or after a deferral. Since its inception in 2018, with Yale Law School securing the top position, the Fortuna Ranking of US Law School Rankings has consistently placed Yale at #1, while Harvard and Stanford have maintained their positions as #2 and #3 respectively in the latest 2023-2024 ranking. The school also saw a greater percentage of its students go on to become Supreme Court clerks between the 2000 and 2010 terms than any other law school, more than double the percentage of the second-highest law school (Harvard Law School). Additionally, a 2010 survey of &quot;scholarly impact,&quot; measured by per capita citations to faculty scholarship, found Yale&#x27;s faculty to be the most cited law school faculty in the United States.

In November 2022, Yale made a voluntary decision to pull out of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Law Schools rankings. Describing their methodology as &quot;profoundly flawed,&quot; Yale claimed that the rankings discourage low-income applicants and &quot;fail to advance the legal profession&quot; by devaluing programs that encourage public interest profession rather than high-paying corporate jobs. Yale&#x27;s decision was followed by Harvard Law School, which also withdrew from the rankings.

=== Admissions ===
Yale Law School enrolls about 200 new students a year, creating one of the smallest classes among top U.S. law schools. Its small class size and prestige combine to make its admissions process the most competitive in the United States. In 2023, the median GPA for the entering class was 3.96, and the median LSAT score was 175.

After an initial round of screening by the admissions department, approximately 25% of applications are independently evaluated by three different faculty members. Each application is scored from 2–4 at the discretion of the reader. All applicants with a perfect 12 (i.e., a 4 from all three faculty members) are admitted, upon which they are immediately notified by the school. There are also 50–80 outstanding students admitted each year without going through this review process.

The LL.M. Program and the Visiting Researchers Program at Yale Law are amongst the smallest and most selective graduate law programs in the United States. Yale Law admits around 25 LL.M. students and around 10 visiting researchers every year. These programs are usually limited to those students who intend to pursue a career in legal academia.

At this distinctive law school, admission to the J.S.D. program is exclusive to candidates who have attained exceptional standing in obtaining their LL.M. degree at Yale Law School and exhibit the promise of delivering outstanding scholarly contributions.

Yale Law admitted only men until 1918.

=== Clinical programs ===
Yale Law School houses over two dozen clinics that allow students to represent clients in real-world legal problems. Participation in clinics is common among Yale Law students, with over 80% of degree candidates participating in clinical activities prior to graduation.

Yale Law&#x27;s clinics cover a wide range of issue areas and legal fields. Students represent clients before courts at all levels of the federal judiciary, state courts in Connecticut and other states, international tribunals and adjudicative bodies, administrative processes, and private arbitration. Yale Law School has greatly expanded its clinical programs in recent years, adding eight new clinics during the 2016–2017 academic year.

=== Summer school with Paris-Panthéon-Assas University ===

Yale Law School signed in June 2011 an Agreement for Collaborative Activities to create an environment for long-term joint research, exchange and programming activities, with Paris-Panthéon-Assas University, the direct inheritor of the Faculty of Law of Paris and acting law school of the Sorbonne University. They organize, together with the ESSEC Business School, a summer school in law and economics, the &quot;Yale-Paris II-Essec Summer School&quot;.

Yale Law School&#x27;s Law School Transparency under-employment score is 8.4%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.

The median salary for a class of 2021 graduate 10 months after graduation was $94,000. and the mean salary for a class of 2021 graduate 10 months after graduation was $136,943.

<text>The posts of shadow United States senator and shadow United States representative are held by elected or appointed government officials from subnational polities of the United States that lack congressional vote. While these officials are not seated in either chamber of Congress, they seek recognition for their subnational polity, up to full statehood. This would enfranchise them with full voting rights on the floor of the U.S. House and Senate, alongside existing states. , only the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico currently have authorized shadow delegations to Congress.

This is distinct from shadow delegates, who are elected or appointed from subnational polities of the United States to seek non-voting participation in the House. As of 2024, only the Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians elect shadow delegates.

==History==
Historically, shadow members of Congress were elected by organized incorporated territories prior to their admission to the Union. From its origins in Tennessee, this approach is sometimes known as the Tennessee Plan.

The first shadow senators, William Blount and William Cocke of the Southwest Territory, were elected in March 1796 before being seated as senators representing the newly formed state of Tennessee. Michigan, California, Minnesota, Oregon, and Alaska likewise elected shadow senators before statehood. The Alaska Territory also elected the first shadow U.S. representative, Ralph Julian Rivers, in 1956. All were eventually seated in Congress as voting members, except for Alaska shadow senator William A. Egan, who instead became governor.

==District of Columbia officeholders==
The election of shadow congresspersons from the District of Columbia is authorized by a state constitution ratified by D.C. voters in 1982 but was never approved by Congress.

===District of Columbia shadow senators===
The voters of the District of Columbia elect two shadow U.S. senators who are known as senators by the District of Columbia but are not officially sworn in or seated by the U.S. Senate. Shadow U.S. senators were first elected in 1990.

The current shadow United States senators from the District of Columbia are Paul Strauss and Ankit Jain.

===District of Columbia shadow representatives===
The voters of the District of Columbia elect one shadow representative who is recognized as equivalent to U.S. representatives by the District of Columbia but is not recognized by the U.S. government as an actual member of the House of Representatives. A shadow representative was first elected in 1990. Inaugural office-holder Charles Moreland held the seat for two terms. In November 2020, Oye Owolewa was elected to succeed retiring shadow representative Franklin Garcia.

D.C.&#x27;s shadow U.S. representative should not be confused with the non-voting delegate who represents the district in Congress.

==Puerto Rico officeholders==
The posts of shadow representatives and senators for Puerto Rico were created in 2017 as part of a newly formed Puerto Rico Equality Commission to fulfill campaign promises made by the New Progressive Party, which gained control of both the executive and legislative branch in the 2016 elections in part with calls for a status referendum in 2017. Pro-statehood governor Ricardo Rosselló appointed five shadow representatives and two shadow senators with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico.

Following the pro-statehood vote in the 2020 Puerto Rican status referendum, the Puerto Rican legislature passed in a lame duck session Law 167 of 2020, replacing the Puerto Rico Equality Commission with the new Commission to the Congressional Delegation of Puerto Rico and establishing an electoral process for shadow delegates to Congress. Although an effort to overturn Law 167 passed the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico in early 2021 after the Popular Democratic Party gained control of the legislature, it did not have enough votes to sustain a threatened veto from pro-statehood governor Pedro Pierluisi.

Popular elections for two shadow senators and four shadow members of Congress will be held on a nonpartisan basis every four years, with the first election held on May 16, 2021, so the delegates can take office on July 1. The law also appropriated funds for the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration to cover the wages of the delegates and serve as their headquarters in Washington, D.C., where they will work on the statehood process with the island&#x27;s resident commissioner in Congress.

<text>In crystallography, a crystal system is a set of point groups (a group of geometric symmetries with at least one fixed point). A lattice system is a set of Bravais lattices (an infinite array of discrete points). Space groups (symmetry groups of a configuration in space) are classified into crystal systems according to their point groups, and into lattice systems according to their Bravais lattices. Crystal systems that have space groups assigned to a common lattice system are combined into a crystal family.

The seven crystal systems are &quot;triclinic&quot;, &quot;monoclinic&quot;, &quot;orthorhombic&quot;, &quot;tetragonal&quot;, &quot;trigonal&quot;, &quot;hexagonal&quot;, and &quot;cubic&quot;. Informally, two crystals are in the same crystal system if they have similar symmetries (though there are many exceptions).

== Classifications ==

Crystals can be classified in three ways: lattice systems, crystal systems and crystal families. The various classifications are often confused: in particular the trigonal crystal system is often confused with the rhombohedral lattice system, and the term &quot;crystal system&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;lattice system&quot; or &quot;crystal family&quot;.

=== Lattice system ===
A lattice system is a group of lattices with the same set of lattice point groups. The 14 Bravais lattices are grouped into seven lattice systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic.

=== Crystal system ===
A crystal system is a set of point groups in which the point groups themselves and their corresponding space groups are assigned to a lattice system. Of the 32 crystallographic point groups that exist in three dimensions, most are assigned to only one lattice system, in which case both the crystal and lattice systems have the same name. However, five point groups are assigned to two lattice systems, rhombohedral and hexagonal, because both exhibit threefold rotational symmetry. These point groups are assigned to the trigonal crystal system.

=== Crystal family ===
A crystal family is determined by lattices and point groups. It is formed by combining crystal systems that have space groups assigned to a common lattice system. In three dimensions, the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems are combined into one hexagonal crystal family. 

=== Comparison ===
Five of the crystal systems are essentially the same as five of the lattice systems. The hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems differ from the hexagonal and rhombohedral lattice systems. These are combined into the hexagonal crystal family.

The relation between three-dimensional crystal families, crystal systems and lattice systems is shown in the following table:
:&quot;Note: there is no &quot;trigonal&quot; lattice system. To avoid confusion of terminology, the term &quot;trigonal lattice&quot; is not used.&quot;

==Crystal classes==

The 7 crystal systems consist of 32 crystal classes (corresponding to the 32 crystallographic point groups) as shown in the following table below:

The point symmetry of a structure can be further described as follows. Consider the points that make up the structure, and reflect them all through a single point, so that (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) becomes (−&quot;x&quot;,−&quot;y&quot;,−&quot;z&quot;). This is the &#x27;inverted structure&#x27;. If the original structure and inverted structure are identical, then the structure is &quot;centrosymmetric&quot;. Otherwise it is &quot;non-centrosymmetric&quot;. Still, even in the non-centrosymmetric case, the inverted structure can in some cases be rotated to align with the original structure. This is a non-centrosymmetric &quot;achiral&quot; structure. If the inverted structure cannot be rotated to align with the original structure, then the structure is &quot;chiral&quot; or &quot;enantiomorphic&quot; and its symmetry group is &quot;enantiomorphic&quot;.

A direction (meaning a line without an arrow) is called &quot;polar&quot; if its two-directional senses are geometrically or physically different. A symmetry direction of a crystal that is polar is called a &quot;polar axis&quot;. Groups containing a polar axis are called &quot;polar&quot;. A polar crystal possesses a unique polar axis (more precisely, all polar axes are parallel). Some geometrical or physical property is different at the two ends of this axis: for example, there might develop a dielectric polarization as in pyroelectric crystals. A polar axis can occur only in non-centrosymmetric structures. There cannot be a mirror plane or twofold axis perpendicular to the polar axis, because they would make the two directions of the axis equivalent.

The crystal structures of chiral biological molecules (such as protein structures) can only occur in the 65 enantiomorphic space groups (biological molecules are usually chiral). 
==Bravais lattices==

There are seven different kinds of lattice systems, and each kind of lattice system has four different kinds of centerings (primitive, base-centered, body-centered, face-centered). However, not all of the combinations are unique; some of the combinations are equivalent while other combinations are not possible due to symmetry reasons. This reduces the number of unique lattices to the 14 Bravais lattices.

The distribution of the 14 Bravais lattices into 7 lattice systems is given in the following table.


In geometry and crystallography, a Bravais lattice is a category of translative symmetry groups (also known as lattices) in three directions.

Such symmetry groups consist of translations by vectors of the form

:R = &quot;n&quot;1a1 + &quot;n&quot;2a2 + &quot;n&quot;3a3,

where &quot;n&quot;1, &quot;n&quot;2, and &quot;n&quot;3 are integers and a1, a2, and a3 are three non-coplanar vectors, called &quot;primitive vectors&quot;.

These lattices are classified by the space group of the lattice itself, viewed as a collection of points; there are 14 Bravais lattices in three dimensions; each belongs to one lattice system only. They represent the maximum symmetry a structure with the given translational symmetry can have.

All crystalline materials (not including quasicrystals) must, by definition, fit into one of these arrangements.

For convenience a Bravais lattice is depicted by a unit cell which is a factor 1, 2, 3, or 4 larger than the primitive cell. Depending on the symmetry of a crystal or other pattern, the fundamental domain is again smaller, up to a factor 48.

The Bravais lattices were studied by Moritz Ludwig Frankenheim in 1842, who found that there were 15 Bravais lattices. This was corrected to 14 by A. Bravais in 1848.

==In other dimensions==
===Two-dimensional space===
In two-dimensional space, there are four crystal systems (oblique, rectangular, square, hexagonal), four crystal families (oblique, rectanguar, square, hexagonal), and four lattice systems (oblique, rectangular, square, and hexagonal).

===Four-dimensional space=== 

‌The four-dimensional unit cell is defined by four edge lengths (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) and six interaxial angles (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;, &quot;ε&quot;, &quot;ζ&quot;). The following conditions for the lattice parameters define 23 crystal families

The names here are given according to Whittaker. They are almost the same as in Brown &quot;et al.&quot;, with exception for names of the crystal families 9, 13, and 22. The names for these three families according to Brown &quot;et al.&quot; are given in parentheses.

The relation between four-dimensional crystal families, crystal systems, and lattice systems is shown in the following table. Enantiomorphic systems are marked with an asterisk. The number of enantiomorphic pairs is given in parentheses. Here the term &quot;enantiomorphic&quot; has a different meaning than in the table for three-dimensional crystal classes. The latter means, that enantiomorphic point groups describe chiral (enantiomorphic) structures. In the current table, &quot;enantiomorphic&quot; means that a group itself (considered as a geometric object) is enantiomorphic, like enantiomorphic pairs of three-dimensional space groups P31 and P32, P4122 and P4322. Starting from four-dimensional space, point groups also can be enantiomorphic in this sense.

<text>Rom is a recurring character on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. He is played by Max Grodénchik.

Rom is a Ferengi, the son of Keldar and Ishka. He is Quark&#x27;s younger brother, and the father of Nog. On the show he is often used for comic relief, but over the show&#x27;s run the character grows in importance. In the early seasons, he works at Quark&#x27;s bar.

==Background==
Max Grodenchik previously played two different Ferengi characters in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes &quot;Captain&#x27;s Holiday&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot;. While working on &quot;Perfect Mate&quot;, the head of the makeup department Michael Westmore told Grodénchik about a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, that it would include a Ferengi as a series regular and that his agent should check for casting call coming in a few months time. Months later, Grodénchik read for the role of Quark at a large and busy casting call, but did not feel the audition went well and did not expect to hear back, forgetting about it. A few weeks later, at a smaller casting call, he auditioned again, but did not think it went well that time either. As he was waiting disappointed outside the gates of Paramount Studios, Armin Shimerman came over and talked to him. Shimerman had figured out that they were the last two up for the role of Quark, but he also noticed that the script mentioned Quark&#x27;s nephew Nog and so there was the possibility of there being the part of Nog&#x27;s father. In the pilot episode, he was hired for one day&#x27;s work in the role of &quot;Ferengi Pit Boss&quot;. Grodénchik was hired for one episode at a time and was contracted on a day-by-day basis for the duration of his role as Rom. He was hired again as a guest star on the fourth episode and was credited as &quot;Rom&quot;. He would return to play Rom in thirty-seven episodes.

==Overview==
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe, Rom was born around 2335. Rom does not have the business acumen typically associated with the Ferengi race; he is described as one who &quot;didn&#x27;t have the &#x27;lobes&#x27; for business&quot;. He has a knack for fixing things, but until around 2372, he works exclusively as a waiter and stock boy in his brother Quark&#x27;s bar on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;). Rom frequently displays a lack of confidence, largely due to Quark&#x27;s habit of belittling him. There is evidence to suggest that Quark was attempting to protect Rom from inevitable failure by preventing him from venturing into business for himself. Nevertheless, after four years living among Federation and Bajoran citizens on the station, and following his son Nog&#x27;s admission to Starfleet (which made him very proud), Rom leaves the bar to become an engineer in the Bajoran Militia. However, Rom still frequents the bar and keeps his brother company often, but as a paying customer whom Quark has to respect.

Odo once describes Rom as &quot;an idiot, [who] couldn&#x27;t fix a straw if it was bent&quot;. These opinions are only due to Rom&#x27;s social ineptitude and meek, almost subservient, demeanor, and stand in contrast to his genius as an engineer. His talents play an important role in the Dominion War. In 2373, Rom designs and distributes a self-replicating minefield that blocks access to the Bajoran wormhole and prevents Dominion reinforcements from entering the Alpha Quadrant for several months.

His first wife, Prinadora, bore his son Nog. She stayed behind on Ferenginar when Rom first came to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, but the marriage was later dissolved after she and her father stole the bulk of his profits. Rom eventually married Leeta, a Bajoran Dabo girl employed at Quark&#x27;s bar, after a period of doubt about her love after having been burned in his first marriage.

When Grand Nagus Zek becomes less greedy after coming into contact with the Bajoran prophets, he founds the &quot;Ferengi Benevolent Association&quot; and appoints Rom chairman (&quot;Prophet Motive&quot;). Acting atypically, Rom takes advantage of the opportunity and embezzles money from the charity.

Throughout his seven years on &quot;DS9&quot;, Rom undergoes great personal growth as a colleague, parent and in nearly every other aspect of his life and career. He also proves valuable, on several occasions, in helping his people deal with important issues facing their society. Not the least through the influence of his Starfleet neighbours, Rom becomes a more thoughtful and caring individual. In 2375, to the shock of everyone, including Rom himself, Zek appoints Rom to succeed him as Grand Nagus, becoming the new leader of the Ferengi and their economy. Rom&#x27;s political affiliations are frequently hinted as being left-wing and more liberal than those of his brother. In the episode &quot;Bar Association&quot;, he forms a union of the bar staff at Quark&#x27;s bar and quotes Karl Marx (&quot;Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!&quot;) as well as demonstrating admiration for Miles O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ancestor, Sean Aloysius O&#x27;Brien, a union leader.

Quark, Rom and Nog do not understand or speak English/Federation Standard, but rather rely on Universal Translators implanted near their ears (&quot;Little Green Men&quot;).

Rom&#x27;s final appearance in the series is &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, the second-to-last episode of the final season.

==Star Trek: Lower Decks==
By 2381, Grand Nagus Rom and his wife, First Clerk Leeta, instituted numerous reforms such as discouraging the arms trade for a longer term focus on other priorities, such as the hospitality industry. During the preliminary process of having the Ferengi homeworld joining the United Federation of Planets, they test the Federation representation to see if they are gullible by their onerous contract negotiations. After being impressed by Captain Freeman, who successfully traps them into an impossible commitment in writing to bring the Klingon homeworld into the Federation -- thus also proving that the Federation respects the Ferengi&#x27;s culture -- they agree to sign the original agreement. In addition, Grand Nagus Rom also indulges in baseball with considerable personal equipment for that sport. (Star Trek: Lower Decks: Parth Ferengi&#x27;s Heart Place)

Media scholar Daniel Sutko described Rom as a &quot;lovable buffoon&quot;. Though often employed for comic effect, &quot;Trekonomics&quot; author Manu Saadia deemed Rom central to what he considered the turning point in the &quot;Ferengi arc&quot; in &quot;DS9&quot;. He suffered because his considerable talents were unsuited for advancing in his society, but &quot;Rom finally breaks free from the ideological constrains of his own culture, centuries upon centuries of traditions and learned behaviors. He discovers that he can actually do that, and that it does not kill him&quot;. As the Ferengi are presented as &quot;sort of a parody of the 1990s or 2000s American acquisitive businessman&quot;, Rom&#x27;s great transformation is appropriately exemplified by his formation of a trade union and even quoting verbatim from the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;. Likewise, Uwe Meyer stated that Rom draws on human ideology, both Communist and that of American trade unions, and that he is presented in a likeable way not the least because he is strongly influenced by the values of the Federation. J. Emmentt Winn in contrast saw the Ferengi&#x27;s story arc, in which Rom played a major role, as problematic, as development towards the assimilation of the &quot;other&quot; into the dominant culture, the &quot;right&quot; choice only in the ethnocentric view of that mainstream culture.

Nadja Sennewald analyzed the roles of Rom and Quark in two gender-swapping &quot;DS9&quot; episodes. Rom is shown as generally unmasculine, emphasized in the episode &quot;Profit and Lace&quot; by presenting him as an expert for &#x27;female&#x27; movement, and much better suited to imitating a woman than Quark, who actually has to fill that role. In &quot;Rules of Acquisition&quot; an envious Rom competes with Pel, a Ferengi woman disguised as a man, for Quark&#x27;s attention. Rom is again presented as feminized in Ferengi terms, both biologically - he has comparatively small ear-lobes - and culturally - he lacks in business acumen. This three-way-relationship is repeatedly presented in filmic terms as a triangle where Rom is pushed to the side or background. In the end Rom re-establishes his masculinity by one-upping Quark, blackmailing him into transferring his bar to him, and by exposing and driving away Pel.

In 2013, &quot;Wired&quot; said that Rom was arguably the best character in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, and even in the entire &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. They praise how Max Grodénchik brought the character to life, presenting a nuanced and layered character over the seven season run. They note how Rom transforms from a comedic sidekick for Quark to a saviour character who was much more important to the series. In 2021, Julian Beauvais, writing for &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, thought that Rom was an honorable character for trying to take care of his family, using his engineering abilities to help defeat the Dominion during the war, and as Grand Nagus planning to reform Ferengi society to be more egalitarian. In 2015, &quot;SyFy&quot; rated Rom among the 21 most interesting supporting characters of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, remarking &quot;he was far from your typical Ferengi&quot; because he was not good at business.

<doc id="456414" wikidata="Q3650652" url="?curid=456414" title="Lap joint">
<text>A lap joint or overlap joint is a joint in which the members overlap. 
Lap joints can be used to join wood, plastic, or metal. A lap joint can be used in woodworking for joining wood together.

A lap joint may be a full lap or half lap. In a full lap, no material is removed from either of the members that will be joined, resulting in a joint which is the combined thickness of the two members. In a half lap joint or halving joint, material is removed from both of the members so that the resulting joint is the thickness of the thickest member. Most commonly in half lap joints, the members are of the same thickness and half the thickness of each is removed.

With respect to wood joinery, this joint, where two long-grain wood faces are joined with glue, is among the strongest in ability to resist shear forces, exceeding even mortise and tenon and other commonly-known &quot;strong&quot; joints. 

With respect to metal welding, this joint, made by overlapping the edges of the plate, is not recommended for most work. The single lap has very little resistance to bending. It can be used satisfactorily for joining two cylinders that fit inside one another.

==Applications==

* Frame assembly in cabinet making
* Temporary framing
* Some applications in timber frame construction
* Tabling

==Halving laps==

Halving lap joints are used extensively in transition and cabinetry for framing. They are quick and easy to make and provide high strength through good long grain to long grain gluing surface. The shoulders provide some resistance to racking (diagonal distortion). They may be reinforced with dowels or mechanical fasteners to resist twisting of the wood.

==End lap==

Also known simply as a &quot;pull lap&quot;, it is the basic form of the lap joint and is used when joining members end to end either parallel or at right angles. When the joint forms a corner, as in a rectangular frame, the joint is often called a &quot;corner lap&quot;. This is the most common form of end lap and is used most in framing.

For a half lap in which the members are parallel, the joint may be known as a &quot;half lap splice&quot;. This is a splice joint and is an alternative to scarfing when joining shorter members end to end.

Both members in an end lap have one shoulder and one cheek each.

Use for:
* Internal cabinet frames
* Visible frames when the frame members are to be shaped.

==Cross lap==

The main difference between this and the basic half lap is that the joint occurs in the middle of one or both members, rather than at the end. The two members are at right angles to each other and one member may terminate at the joint, or it may carry on beyond it. When one of the members terminates at the shin, it is often referred to as a &quot;tee lap&quot; or &quot;middle lap&quot;. In a cross lap where both members continue beyond the joint, each member has two shoulders and one cheek. 

Use for:
* Internal cabinet frames
* Simple framing and bracing

==Dovetail lap==

This is a lap in which the housing has been cut at an angle which, resists withdrawal of the stem from the cross-piece.

Use for:
* Framing applications where tension forces could pull the joint apart

==Mitred half lap==

The mitred half lap is the weakest version of the joint because of the reduced gluing surface.

Use for:
* Visible framing applications where a mitred corner is desired

* Bridle joint
* Halved joint

<doc id="456424" wikidata="Q762694" url="?curid=456424" title="PostScript Printer Description">
<text>PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files are created by vendors to describe the entire set of features and capabilities available for their PostScript printers.

A PPD also contains the PostScript code (commands) used to invoke features for the print job. As such, PPDs function as drivers for all PostScript printers, by providing a unified interface for the printer&#x27;s capabilities and features. For example, a generic PPD file for all models of HP Color LaserJet contains:
*% Basic Device Capabilities
*LanguageLevel: &quot;2&quot;
*ColorDevice: True
*DefaultColorSpace: CMYK
*TTRasterizer: Type42
*FileSystem: False
*Throughput: &quot;10&quot;

which specifies that the printer understands PostScript Level 2, is a color device, and so forth. The PPD can describe allowable paper sizes, memory configurations, the minimum font set for the printer, and even specify a tree-based user interface for printer-specific configuration.

A PPD is also often called &quot;PostScript Page Description&quot; instead of &quot;Printer Description&quot;, this is because PostScript has the concept of &quot;Page Devices&quot; where the PostScript page description configuration is read from or saved as a PPD file.

== CUPS ==
CUPS uses PPD drivers for all of its PostScript printers, and has even extended the concept to allow for PostScript printing to non-PostScript printing devices, by directing output through a CUPS filter. Such a file is no longer a standard PPD, but rather a &quot;CUPS-PPD&quot;.
CUPS clients usually read the current PPD file from the server every time a new print job is created. It is located in codice_1 or codice_2.
== Windows ==
Microsoft Windows also uses PPD files but converts these to a binary .BPD file format before using them. These, both PPD and BPD, are normally stored in codice_3 on an x86 system, or codice_4 on a 64 bit system.

Updating a PPD file requires four steps:
# stop the spooling service;
# edit the existing PPD file in place or replace it by an updated version;
# remove the old BPD file;
# restart the spooling service.
This will automatically generate a new BPD from the updated PPD.

== MIME type ==
The MIME type for the CUPS variant of PPD is application/vnd.cups-ppd.

<doc id="456425" wikidata="Q579509" url="?curid=456425" title="Massey Ferguson">
<text>Massey Ferguson is an agricultural machinery manufacturer, established in 1953 through the merger of farm equipment makers Massey-Harris of Canada and the Ferguson Company of the United Kingdom. It was based in Coventry then moved to Beauvais in 2003 when the Coventry factory was shut down.

== History ==
=== Massey Manufacturing Co. ===
In 1847, Daniel Massey established the Newcastle Foundry and Machine Manufactory in what is now Newcastle, Ontario. The company made some of the world&#x27;s first mechanical threshers, at first by assembling parts from the United States, but eventually designing and building its own equipment. Daniel Massey&#x27;s son, Hart Massey, renamed the enterprise the Massey Manufacturing Co.

In 1879, the company moved to Toronto and it soon became one of the city&#x27;s leading employers. It was located on King Street West at Strachan Avenue, occupying the former Toronto exhibition grounds, the site of Toronto&#x27;s Crystal Palace, just south of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum and north of the Central Prison. The huge complex of factories, consisting of a site with plant and head office at 915 King Street West (now part of Liberty Village), became one of the best-known features of the city. The company expanded further and began to sell its products internationally. Through extensive advertising campaigns, it became one of the most well-known brands in Canada. A labor shortage throughout the country also helped to make the firm&#x27;s mechanized equipment very attractive.

=== Massey-Harris Limited ===

In 1891, the Massey Manufacturing Co. merged with A. Harris, Son and Company to form Massey-Harris Limited, which became the largest agricultural equipment maker in the British Empire. Massey-Harris made threshing machines and reapers, as well as safety bicycles, introducing a shaft-driven model in 1898. In 1910, Massey-Harris acquired the Johnston Harvester Company of Batavia, New York, making it one of Canada&#x27;s first multinational firms.

Hart Massey&#x27;s sons Charles, Walter, Chester and Fred became closely involved in the business and eventually took over its operations. They were the last generation of Masseys to run Massey-Harris. President Vincent Massey left to become a minister in the Mackenzie King government. In 1927, an unsolicited takeover offer from an unnamed US purchaser precipitated a power struggle for control of the firm. The US bid was turned down, and control remained in Canadian hands with the sale of the Massey&#x27;s stock for to Thomas Bradshaw and J.H. Gundy of Toronto. Members of the family accomplished other things in business. Vincent Massey later became Governor General of Canada. Raymond Massey became a noted actor in American films. The Massey family used its fortune to improve the city of Toronto and many institutions including the University of Guelph, University of Toronto, Upper Canada College, Crescent School, Appleby College, Massey Hall, and Metropolitan United Church were partially financed by the Masseys.

The company&#x27;s early tractor models included the 20 horsepower Massey-Harris GP 15/22 (1930–36), 25 horsepower &#x27;Massey-Harris Pacemaker&#x27; (1936–1939), 35 horsepower Model 101 (1938–1942), Massey-Harris Pony, Model 20, Model 81, and Model 744.

Grain harvesting was revolutionized by Massey engineer Tom Carroll in 1938, with the world&#x27;s first affordable, mass-produced, self-propelled combine— the No. 20. It was too heavy and expensive for extensive mass production, but served as a guide for the design of the lighter and less costly No. 21, which was tested in 1940 and put on sale in 1941. The Massey-Harris No. 21 Combine was commemorated with a Canada Post stamp on 8 June 1996. Massey-Harris also produced one of the world&#x27;s first four-wheel drive tractors.

E.P. Taylor, one of C.D. Howe&#x27;s dollar-a-year men, joined the board of directors in 1942, and Eric Phillips joined management in 1946. The company became one of the prime jewels of the Argus Corporation.

The final generation of Massey-Harris tractors, introduced immediately after World War II, included the 25-horsepower M-H 22 series, the 35 horsepower M-H 33 series, the 45 horsepower M-H 44 series and the 55 horsepower M-H 55 series. In 1952, the M-H 22 was replaced by the M-H 23 Mustang. In 1955, the 30-horsepower Massey-Harris 50 was introduced after the merger that created Massey-Harris-Ferguson. It was based on the Ferguson TO-35 and was also produced as the F-40 for Ferguson dealers. The MH-50 was available in several configurations: utility, high-crop utility, or row-crop with a choice of single, tricycle, or wide adjustable front ends. In 1956, the M-H 33 was replaced by the MH 333, while the M-H 44 was replaced by the M-H 444 and the M-H 55 was replaced by the M-H 555. The tractors were commonly known as the &quot;triple series&quot; and were mechanically similar to their predecessors, however they featured new styling which included a slightly different hood design, chrome trim on the grill and hood, and a different color scheme. They were also available with power steering, live power take-off (PTO), and hydraulics. The Massey Harris triple series tractors remained in production until 1958.

==== Military contracts ====
During World War II and afterwards Massey Harris undertook a number of contracts to produce tractors, tanks and self-propelled artillery vehicles for the United States Armed Forces. Vehicles produced by Massey Harris include the following:

* M5 Stuart light tank (250 M5s, and 3,530 M5A1s built)
* M24 Chaffee light tank
* M41 Howitzer Motor Carriage self-propelled artillery (built on M24 chassis)
* M44 self propelled howitzer (250 built in early 1950s on M41 Walker Bulldog tank chassis)
* M36 Jackson tank destroyer
* M19 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage Self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery vehicle (300 built)
* I-162 Military tractor built for the United States Army (25 built)
* I-244 Military tractor built for the United States Air Force, United States Navy, and United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1955 and 1956
* I-330 Military tractor built for the United States Navy (6 built)
=== Massey Ferguson ===
In 1953, Massey-Harris merged with the Ferguson Company to become Massey-Harris-Ferguson, before shortening it to Massey Ferguson in 1958. They tried to consolidate the two dealer networks and product lines. Its television and radio advertising featured an upbeat jingle with a male chorus singing, &quot;He&#x27;s a get-up-early, keep-&#x27;em-rollin, Massey-Ferguson kind of a man.&quot; Nevertheless, the company soon began to decline financially after facing increasing international competition in the 1960s, when the firm began to struggle.

==== Hanomag-Cura, Argentina ====
In 1971, Massey purchased the local facilities of Rheinstahl Hanomag-Cura in Argentina, which had been established in 1960. The production of tractors and other agricultural implements, during until 1999. Some model numbers made in Argentina included 65R/250/252, 155, 150, 5160 S-2 / S-4, 5140 / 5140–4, 265, 255, 250, 250 S &quot;viñatero&quot;, 8500 and 9500.

Other model numbers included 1075, 1078, 1095h, 1098, 1175 / 1175 S, 1185 / 1185 S, 1195 L / 1195 S-2/S-4, 1215 S-2 / S-4, 1340 S-2/S-4, 1360 S2/S4, 1615 L / S 1615 L, 1640, 1650, 1670, 1690, 1465, 1475 &quot;Super alto&quot;, 1485, 1499 SX / 1499 L.

==== Sunshine, Australia ====

In 1955, Massey purchased the Australian manufacturers of Sunshine harvesters, H.V. McKay Pty Limited. Hugh Victor McKay had invented the combine harvester in 1884, the first machine to combine the functions of reaping, threshing and winnowing grain from a standing crop. By the 1920s, H.V. McKay Pty Ltd was running the largest implement factory in the southern hemisphere, covering , and led the international agricultural industry through the development of the world&#x27;s first self-propelled harvester in 1924.

In 1930, the H.V. McKay Pty Limited was granted exclusive Australian distribution of Massey-Harris machinery. The company was then renamed H.V. McKay Massey Harris Pty Ltd. Throughout World War II, H.V. McKay Massey Harris exported over 20,000 Sunshine drills, disc harrows and binders to England to facilitate the increase in food production.

In 1955, the remainder of H.V. McKay Pty Ltd was sold to Massey Ferguson. Manufacturing ended in 1986, and the last section was sold off and demolished in 1992. The former bulk store, factory gates and clock tower, factory gardens, and head office complex still exist and are all listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

==== Landini ====
In 1959, Massey bought 100% of Landini which is based in Italy. Landini has built many models for Massey over the years, especially vineyard and crawler models. Massey sold 66% to ARGO SpA in 1989, another percentage later to Iseki, and the final part was sold to ARGO in 2000.

==== Perkins ====
In 1959, Perkins Engines from Peterborough, England was purchased. Perkins was the main diesel engine supplier for Massey Ferguson for many years. In 1990, Massey Ferguson took over Dorman Diesels of Stafford merging it with Perkins to form Perkins Engines (Stafford) Ltd. In the 1980s, Perkins purchased Rolls-Royce (Diesels) Ltd, to form Perkins Engines (Shrewsbury) Ltd. In 1994, Perkins was bought by LucasVarity, who sold it in 1998 to Caterpillar Inc., who was a major customer for Perkins&#x27;s smaller and mid-sized engines; Caterpillar was a major producer of large diesel engines for stationary and mobile applications.

==== Ebro of Spain ====
In 1966, Massey purchased 32% of the Spanish tractor and auto company Ebro, or Motor Iberica. Ebro had previously built Ford tractors under license, but now began building models for Massey, and Massey models under license. Massey sold its interest to Nissan in the 1980s.

In the early 1960s, Massey Ferguson moved their head office from 915 King Street to the Sun Life Tower at 200 University Avenue in the Downtown Toronto.

In 1969, Massey Ferguson began producing a line of snowmobiles under the name &quot;Ski Whiz&quot;. The snowmobile line was discontinued in 1977, due to a decline in sales.

==== Activities in Germany ====
In 1973, Massey purchased German Eicher tractor and many Massey-licensed Eichers were built. They later sold their interest and Dromson now owns Eicher which now builds specialized tractors for vineyards and such.

The firm purchased control of Hanomag in 1974. After a loss of $250 million over the next five years, Hanomag was sold off.

==== Conrad Black take-over ====

On 16 August 1978, Conrad Black, whose family had obtained control of Argus Corporation, an investor in Massey Ferguson, became active in Massey Ferguson&#x27;s management. In 1977, chairman Albert A. Thornbrough received a $471,000 salary, the highest executive salary in Canada at the time. During the 50 years between 1929 and 1979, the firm made more than 4% profit on its sales only five times. Under Black&#x27;s leadership, Massey Ferguson instituted significant cost-cutting programmes and down-sized its work force in an attempt to improve its profitability. During the late 1970s, production was relocated from Toronto to a new, large facility in Brantford, Ontario. In 1978, Massey Ferguson was the first to introduce an electronic control system for the three-point hitch on a tractor. However a worldwide decline in the agricultural equipment market combined with high inflation, high domestic interest rates and a major recession, caused Massey Ferguson to slip into a loss and seek relief from creditors. On 31 October 1979, Volkswagen AG made an informal offer for 51% of the firm, but was rebuffed by Black. On 23 May 1980, Black resigned as chairman. In a subsequent series of detailed and lengthy letters to Herb Gray—the then Canadian Minister of Industry under the government of Pierre Trudeau—he remarked on the challenges faced by the firm, and outlined his solution, which would have seen the Canadian and Ontario governments as well as Argus Corporation refloat the ailing firm. Black failed to obtain a suitable response, and resolved to cut his losses.

==== Varity ====
In October 1980, Argus donated its shares in Massey Ferguson to the employee&#x27;s pension plans, leading the way to a bail-out from the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario for the collapsing business, which later was renamed Varity Corporation. In 1986, Varity spun off several money-losing divisions into an entity called Massey Combines Corporation. Massey Combines Corporation was headquartered in Brantford and became insolvent on 4 March 1988, and its assets were re-acquired by Massey Ferguson.

Varity left Toronto and relocated its head office to the Williams-Butler House at 672 Delaware Avenue in the Millionaire Row area of Buffalo, New York. The Toronto manufacturing complex was demolished and the property sold and re-developed, leaving only its head office building standing. Despite its hardships, Massey Ferguson was selling 25% more tractors than its nearest competitors at this time.

In 1992, a management buyout of MF Industrial created Fermec, which ceased trading in 2001 when it was taken over by the Terex Corporation, formerly a unit of General Motors. The sale encompassed all construction equipment from Massey. It was then purchased by Case Corporation in 1997.

In 1994, Massey Ferguson&#x27;s worldwide holdings were purchased by the United States–based AGCO Corporation for in cash and $18 million in stock.

In August 1996, Varity merged with Lucas Automotive to become LucasVarity. After a series of mergers and takeovers, the remains of LucasVarity were acquired by the United States company TRW in 1999 for .

==== AGCO ownership ====
While Massey-Ferguson had a strong global presence at 20% market share in 1994, it sold 87% of its machines outside North America. The acquisition by AGCO had the aim to increase AGCO&#x27;s global presence outside North America and increase Massey Ferguson&#x27;s presence inside North America. In 2008, the 8600 series became the first agricultural tractor world-wide to feature Selective Catalytic Reduction emissions technology branded as e3.

In June 2012, the facility in Jackson, Minnesota was expanded to start building Massey Ferguson and comparable AGCO &quot;Challenger&quot; models for the North American market. Since production began at AGCO Jackson, the facility has produced &quot;7600&quot; series and &quot;8600&quot; series Massey Ferguson tractors for the North American market. Production at the Jackson facility also included the 7700, 8700, 7700S, and 8700S Massey Ferguson tractors.

In January 2020, AGCO announced the expansion of its factory in Beauvais, France. After the expansion, the factory will cover a total area of 54 ha and employ up to 2,500 people. New Massey Ferguson models will be designed, built, and tested in the factory. With the completion of this factory expansion at the Beauvais location, the production of the 7700S and 8700S models in Jackson ceased and returned to Beauvais only in the year 2022 as the new expansion is expected to fulfill global demand for those high-horsepower tractor models. The move was made by AGCO&#x27;s management due to the increased demand for the company&#x27;s self-propelled application equipment and Fendt track tractors which are produced at the location in Jackson.

Since AGCO acquired the company, there has been a resurgence and expansion of the Massey Ferguson brand worldwide. Row-crop tractors have continuously been produced in the Beauvais, France factory since 1960 and in June 2022, the 1,000,000th tractor was produced bearing the Massey-Ferguson brand. The first tractor model from the Beauvais plant was an 825 and the millionth tractor was an 8S.305 with Dyna-VT transmission.

==Overview of tractor models==
Massey Ferguson developed a wide range of agricultural vehicles and have a large share in the market across the world especially in Europe. 

Beginning in December 1957, the MF35 which was the first Massey Ferguson branded tractor rolled off the factory floor. It was a Ferguson design that started its life in 1955 as the Ferguson 35, often nicknamed &quot;Gold Belly&quot; due to the gold engine and gearbox. The 35&#x27;s were massively popular and sold across the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and the United States. These were followed by other early models like the 65 (MK1 indirect injection) and 65 (MK2 direct injection).

Starting in 1964, the next big selling model was the MF135 which became widely popular because of its reliability and power compared to other tractors at the time. This was the first model in the MF 100 series. These included the MF 130, 133, 135, 145, 148, 150, 158, 165, 168, 175, 178, 180, 185 and 188. 

In 1969, the MF 1000 series was introduced. This model lineup included the MF 1080, 1100, 1130 and 1150. 

In 1971 the first articulated tractors were introduced: MF 1500 and 1800. The smaller MF 1200 (1972) was built in Manchester for the European market. 

In 1977, the MF 500 series was introduced containing the models of 550, 560, 565, 575, 590, 595 (500 series).

From the mid-1970s and early 1980s came the 200 series tractor, which included the MF 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 278, 280, 285, 290, 298, 299.

In the mid-1980s, the short-lived 600 series was released. This included the 675, 690, 690T, 695, 698 and 699. The reason behind poor sales figures was due to unattractive styling and poor ergonomics, with the cab sitting much higher than previous MF tractors. Although the cab did give excellent visibility and a flat floor, being high off the ground meant it was best suited to field operations instead of livestock work. The 600 series was one of the first tractors to offer the user an option to control where the hydraulic fluid should be pumped. By moving a switch situated near the floor of the cab, the user could block off flow to the rear hydraulics and link arms, concentrating the full force of the pump on the front loader if equipped.

In the late 1980s, one of the greatest selling tractors of all time was released- the 300 series Massey Ferguson. Excellent power, simplicity of cab, high range of gears and components made the MF 300 series a success especially in Europe. The range included the MF 340, 350, 352, 355, 362, 365, 372, 375, 382, 383, 390, 390T, 393, 394, 395, 398, 399 and 399T (the most powerful and popular Massey Ferguson 399) with horsepower ranging from 45HP to 104HP. The 300 series was also offered with a choice of cab, Hi-Line or Lo-Line. The Hi-Line cab featured a flat floor whilst the Lo-Line cab had a hump in the middle for the transmission tunnel. Some &#x27;original&#x27; examples of the lower horsepower 300-series have been known to fetch prices exceeding £20,000 because of their rarity.
In the mid-1990s, the 6100 series and 8100 series were released including the 6150, 6180 and 8130.
Tractors that came after the 300 series included:
* the 4200 range, the 4300 range, 3600 (early 1990s)
* 3000/3100 (early to mid-1990s)
* 3005/3105 (mid-1990s)
* 6100 (late 1990s), 6200 (late 1990s/early 2000s (decade))
* 8200 (late 1990s/early 2000s)
* 5400, 6400, 7400, 8400 (2004-2007)
* 5600, 6600, 7600, 8600 (2009 to 2014)
* 5700, 6700, 7700, 8700, (2014-2018)
* 3700, 4700, 5700, 6700, (global series) 5700S, 6700S, 7700S, and 8700S.

In the 2000s, the Massey Ferguson range included the 8600 series (limited markets), 5400 (limited markets), 5700S, 6700S, 7700S, and 8700S series tractors. New generation AGCO Power engines 8700 S Series provided levels of torque and horse-power unsurpassed in conventional tractor design, from the minimum of fuel. AGCO POWER 6 cylinder 8.4 L engines generated power from 270 to 405 hp.(AGCO Beauvais France) Massey Ferguson tractor production factories also built tractors marketed by AGCO under the &quot;Challenger&quot; brand, and also specific model ranges for Iseki.

In July 2020, Massey Ferguson launched the change of the tractor lineup, starting with the 8S Series that replaced the 7700S range.

In 2021, more models were launched. In January, the 5S Series and in September the 6S Series and 7S Series. This change also brought a new model numbering. For example, an MF 5S.105 – the &quot;5S&quot; stands for the series and the last three digits stands for the maximum power.

In 2022, Massey Ferguson presented the new compact tractor 1700M Series and the new specialized tractor 3S Series.

At Agritechnica in November 2023, Massey Ferguson announced the release of the 9S series, ranging in power from 285 to 425 horsepower.

<text>The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works was a railroad equipment manufacturing company founded by Andrew Carnegie and T.N. Miller in 1865. It was located in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh and since 1907 part of that city.

It repaired an early locomotive known as Bausman&#x27;s Rhinoceros in April 1867. 
Starting in the 1870s under its superintendent and general manager Daniel A. Wightman, it became known for its production of large locomotives. Its engines were shipped around the world, including India and Japan.

By 1901, when Pittsburgh had merged with seven other manufacturing companies to form American Locomotive Company (ALCO), Pittsburgh had produced over 2,400 locomotives. In March 1919, ALCO closed the Pittsburgh facility.

<text>The Peugeot 504 is a mid-size, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive automobile manufactured and marketed by Peugeot from 1968 to 1983 over a single generation, primarily in four-door sedan and wagon configurations – but also as twin two-door coupé and cabriolet configurations as well as pickup truck variants.

The sedan (berline) was styled by Aldo Brovarone of Pininfarina, and the coupé and cabriolet twins were styled by Franco Martinengo at Pininfarina, with wagon (break and familiale) and pickup (camionette) designed and sketches produced in-house at Peugeot.

The 504 was noted for its robust body structure, long suspension travel, high ground clearance, large wheels and torque tube driveshaft – enclosed in a rigid tube attached at each end to the gearbox housing and differential casing, relieving drivetrain torque reactions. The 504 ultimately achieved widespread popularity in far-flung rough-terrain countries – including Latin America and much of Africa.

More than three million 504s were manufactured in its European production, with production continuing globally under various licensing arrangements – including 27,000 assembled in Kenya and 425,000 assembled in Nigeria, using knock-down kits – with production extending into 2006.

Having debuted as Peugeot&#x27;s flagship at the 1968 Paris Salon, the 504 received the 1969 European Car of the Year. In 2013, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;Africa&#x27;s workhorse.&quot;

==History==
===Introduction===
Marketed as Peugeot&#x27;s flagship saloon car, the 504 made its public debut on 12 September 1968 at the Paris Salon. The press launch which had been scheduled for June 1968 was at the last minute deferred by three months, and production got off to a similarly delayed start because of the political and industrial disruption which exploded across France in May 1968.

The 504 was a sunroof-equipped four-door saloon, introduced with a carbureted 1,796 cc four-cylinder petrol engine DIN with on tap with the optional fuel injection. At the time of introduction, Peugeot still used the SAE rating, with claimed power numbers of 87 and 103 cv respectively. A column-mounted four-speed manual transmission was standard; a three-speed ZF 3HP12 automatic became available with the carburetted engine beginning in February 1969. In September 1969 the automatic&#x27;s shifter location was moved from the steering column to the floor.

The 504 was elected European Car of the Year in 1969, praised for its styling, quality, chassis, ride, visibility, strong engine and refinement. 1969 was also when the 504 reached the Australian market.

The 504 Injection two-door coupé and two-door cabriolet were introduced at the Salon de Geneva in March 1969. The engine produced the same of output as in the fuel-injected saloon, but the final drive ratio was slightly revised to give a slightly higher road speed of at 1,000 rpm. Unlike the saloons, the coupé and cabriolet received a floor shifter.

Available models:
* 504 4-door saloon
* 504 Injection 4-door saloon
* 504 Injection 2-door coupé
* 504 Injection 2-door cabriolet

===1970===
The 504 received a new four-cylinder 1971 cc engine, rated at (carburated) and (fuel-injected). At the 1970 Paris Salon a four-cylinder 2112 cc diesel engine rated at was introduced. The 1796 cc petrol engine was no longer available in 504 saloons.

In September 1970 an estate (&quot;Break&quot;) was presented, featuring a higher rear roof, lengthened wheelbase, and solid rear axle with four coil springs. It was joined by the 7-seat &quot;Familiale&quot;, which had all its occupants facing forward in three rows of seats. The Break/Familiale/Commerciale did not actually go on sale until April the following year. The Break and Familiale both received the 2-liter petrol engine or 2.1 diesel as per the saloon, but the utilitarian &quot;Commerciale&quot; brought back the 1.8-litre four, now tuned down to . There was also a Commerciale diesel, using the , 1.95-liter XD88 from the 404 Diesel, enough for a top speed of . The Commerciale had a stripped down interior, with a different dashboard, no carpeting in the cargo area, and seats without headrests. It also received lightly reinforced suspension, single round headlights (seen again on pickups from 1979 on), missing chrome around the side windows, and some trim parts such as the rear view mirrors were painted rather than chromed.

In late 1970 an automatic option was added to the coupé and cabriolet - this was never a large seller and was not always available to the cabriolet but continued to be offered until 1983; in total about 2,500 of the two-door 504s received this transmission option.

* 504 Diesel 4-door saloon/5-door Familiale
* 504 Injection 2-door coupé

===1971===
During 1971 the Break SL (&quot;Super Luxe&quot;) was introduced, a better equipped version using the carburetted 2.0-liter engine. Unlike the regular wagons, the SL received metallic paint, plusher upholstery, and various other additional equipment.

===1972===
During the year, fuel injected 504 saloons changed to a floor-mounted shifter on cars equipped with the manual transmission as well. The 504 Commerciale dropped the round headlights in favor of the standard units.

===1973===
In April 1973, because of the oil crisis Peugeot presented the 504 L. It featured a coil sprung live rear axle and reintroduced the smaller 1796 cc engine, now rated at or for the L Automatique. The different rear axle required somewhat more space; this required some alterations to the floor pan which meant marginally less boot space and rear headroom. At around the same time, the lineup was revamped as listed below. Also new was the 1.95-litre 504 LD saloon, matching the Commerciale diesel although producing . The power of the Commerciale diesel dropped to at the same time. The L saloons can be recognized by the missing bumper overriders and inside by the simpler dashboard with horizontal instrument cluster. Also during 1973, the column shifters were replaced by floor mounted ones on all other 504 saloons than the L.

* 504 Cabriolet (2.0 injection)

===1974===
In August 1974 the second series 504 was introduced. The most noticeable change was the new, more flush fitting doorhandles, and new wheels with rectangular rather than oval openings on the GL and TI models. The GL and TI also received a new, more padded steering wheel. Additionally, the 2.0&#x27;s double carburettor was changed from the Solex SEIA to a Zenith INAT (with no change in power), while the liftgate on the estates changed from steel springs to gas struts.

At the 1974 October Motor Show Peugeot presented a more powerful engine for the 504 coupé and cabriolet, now fitted with a &quot;PRV&quot; 2664 cc V6 unit developed in collaboration with Renault and Volvo. This was the same engine that would be used for the 604 berline, to be introduced at Geneva five months later, in March 1975. The engine incorporated various innovative features such as an aluminium cylinder block, and a fuel-feed system that employed carburetors of differing type, one (type 34 TBIA) featuring a single chamber controlled directly according to the movement of the accelerator pedal, and the second being a twin chamber carburetor (type 35 CEEI) designed to operate simultaneously with the first, using a pneumatic linkage. Maximum output for the 504 coupé and cabriolet fitted with this new V6 engine was given as , supporting a top speed of . During 1975, the first full year of production, 2643 of these six-cylinder 504 coupés and cabriolet were produced, which was considered a respectable number although dwarfed by the 236,733 four-cylinder 504 &quot;berlines&quot; (saloons/sedans) and &quot;breaks&quot; (estates/station wagons) produced by Peugeot in France in the same year. Following the launch of the six-cylinder cars, the four-cylinder versions of the coupé and cabriolet 504s were delisted: they returned to the showrooms in 1978 in response, it was reported, to customer demand.

===1975===
The Break and Break SL were renamed L and GL. The 504 TI received power windows in the rear as well.

===1976===
At the Paris Motor Show of October 1976 an enlarged diesel engine was introduced for the 504 GLD saloon. The stroke of remained the same as that of the existing 2112 cc diesel motor, but for the larger engine the bore was increased to , giving an overall 2304 cc along with an increase in claimed power output from . Briefly, the 2.1 diesel was not offered on any 504 saloons. The 2112 cc diesel engine would also find its way into the Ford Granada since Ford did not at the time produce a sufficient volume of diesel sedans in this class to justify the development of their own diesel engine. From August 1976 on, the power of the 2-liter petrol engines increased marginally, to for the carburetted and fuel injected engines respectively. The grille on the 504 L models was changed from the original chromed metal piece to a black, plastic unit. The 504 TI gained power steering.

===1977===
In September 1977, the 2.3-liter diesel found its way into the new GLD Break and the Familiale Diesel, while the Break L now received a downtuned version of the old 2.1-liter unit, producing . Also new was the option of an automatic transmission for the 2.3 diesel (saloons only). The old 1.9-liter diesel was discontinued, and the basic 504 saloons dropped the &quot;L&quot; designation, gaining a black plastic dash and the steering wheel from the GL/TI in the process. The new 504 diesel saloon was fitted with the erstwhile, 2.1-liter diesel engine that had graced the GLD until the introduction of the 2.3.

The coupé and cabriolet saw the reintroduction of the fuel injected 2.0-liter engine, a response to slow sales of the thirsty V6. The V6 coupé gained a five-speed manual transmission and fuel injection for , while the V6 cabriolet was discontinued after only 970 examples had been built in three years.

===1979 to 1983===
Peugeot 504 production in Europe was pruned back in 1979 with the launch of the Peugeot 505, although the 504 Pickup was introduced as a replacement for the 404 Pickup for the 1980 model year. The last European-made example rolled off the production line in 1983, although the pick up version continued in production, and was available in Europe until 1993. More than three million 504 passenger cars were produced in Europe. The 505 shared most of the Peugeot 504 mechanical parts, similarly to the Peugeot 604 and Talbot Tagora.

==Markets==
As of December 2015, 197 examples of the Peugeot 504 are still in use in Britain.
;United States
For several years, the 504 was Peugeot&#x27;s only model offered in North America. Originally very similar to European specified models, the 504 had to be gradually modified to meet the federal emissions and safety standards. The 2-litre petrol engine was offered alongside the 2.1 diesel, later replaced by the 2.3.

In 1974, the US-spec carburetted 2-litre engine produced at 5200 rpm with a low 7.6:1 compression ratio. The 2.1 diesel was unchanged vis-à-vis the global model, producing at 4500 rpm.

==Post-European production==
===Africa===
Manufacturing continued in Kenya until 2004, and Nigeria until 2006, using the Peugeot knock down kits, which meant that versions of the 504 had been in production in various parts of the world for a total of 38 years. Kenyan production was 27,000 units and the car remained on sale to 2007, being described as &quot;King of the African road&quot;. Egypt also had its own production facilities. In South Africa it was built by PACSA (Peugeot and Citroën South Africa) alongside the 404 until late 1978. Sigma Motor Corporation took over from PACSA in early 1979 and moved 504 production to their &quot;Sigma Park&quot; plant east of Pretoria. South Africa received the two-litre and TI versions until mid-1976 when the lower priced 1800 L version was added. The L has a matt black grille and window surrounds, and did not receive bumper overriders. A similarly equipped L Wagon had arrived earlier in the year, to replace the discontinued 404 Wagon. The Peugeot 504 is also one of the most common vehicles employed as a bush taxi in Africa.

===Asia-Pacific===

The car was assembled in various countries, under license from Peugeot. In Australia it was first released in 1969 and was assembled by Peugeot&#x27;s rival Renault, and sold through Renault Australia&#x27;s dealer network. In 1981 the 504 GL retailed for AUD $11,000. Only the saloon was assembled in Australia, while the Break and Familiale models were imported fully built-up from France.

In China, the 504 was produced in pickup form, with a four-door crew cab, a live rear axle, on an extended estate platform. These were built by Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company. Chinese production of the 504 pickup ceased in 1997, when the joint venture folded.

===South America===

The Peugeot 504 was also produced by SAFRAR in Argentina, beginning in 1969. In 1980 Sevel Argentina took over production in El Palomar near Buenos Aires, in sedan, estate (1980 and 1981 only), and pickup forms. The sedan was built until 1999, with the last new cars sold in 2000. The pickup was manufactured in single and double cab with payload of over 1 tonne (1300 kg ) from 1983 to 1997, and exported mainly to bordering countries. In 1991 the later models were restyled at the front and rear, with the lamps and bumpers changing design. These cars were also given a new interior. Argentinian 504s offered the 1971 cc petrol four-cylinder or the 2304 cc diesel.

SAFRAR also produced a sports version of the sedan called &quot;504 TN&quot; between 1977 and 1978; this was intended to suit local competition classes like &quot;Turismo Nacional&quot; hence the name of the version. This version had a XN1 2.0 litres engine but with a new intake and exhaust manifold with four individual outlets, a double-mouth Solex carburetor and a camshaft with greater elevation (7.5 mm against 6.7 mm of the previous one) among other changes with the engine reaching .

===Dangel models===
The French company Dangel also produced Peugeot approved four-wheel drive Break (estate/station wagon) and pickup models.

Its engines and suspension were used in later models of the Paykan, the Iranian version of the Hillman Hunter.

==Pickup and commercials==
In September 1979, for the 1980 model year, the 504 Pickup was introduced. The considerable work involved in converting the 504&#x27;s monocoque body into a load-carrying version had taken a full decade. The pickup used the longer wheelbase and live rear axle of the 504 Break. On introduction, it was available with very basic spec and single round headlights, fitted in plastic frames shaped like the 504&#x27;s &quot;cat&#x27;s eyes.&quot; The engine options were the 404&#x27;s 1618 cc petrol (U01) and 1948 cc diesel (U20); outputs are respectively. This was the only 504 sold with the 1.6-litre XC5 engine. As with most of Peugeot&#x27;s commercial vehicles, the 504 Pickup was assembled by Chausson. Cargo capacity was for both versions; models exported to Africa were rated at (V01/V20). A chassis cab model was also offered, and manufacturers such as Heuliez offered a number of different applications for the 504 chassis. Germany&#x27;s Bimobil even offered a demountable camper for the 504, weighing about . Around 300 of these were built, following an initial order of twenty made by Peugeot themselves.

As with the regular 504, the pickup has rear-wheel-drive and a floor-shifted four-speed manual transmission. A locking differential was also standard. Late-model pickups were also available with a five-speed transmission. In July 1981, Dangel added a four-wheel-drive version of the Pickup. These were mainly purchased by French governmental agencies, as their procurement rules required them to purchase French when possible. About 5500 Dangel 4x4 Pickups were built until the model&#x27;s discontinuation in 1994.

For 1982 the better equipped 504 Pickup GR was added, these received some chrome touches and luxuries such as a clock and door-mounted armrests. Externally, the GR was set apart by black rubber bumper overriders, different hubcaps and a modicum of chrome ornamentation (the standard version received a grille and bumpers painted light gray). By 1984, the chrome parts were dropped in favor of a cleaner, more modern appearance. The GR was renamed &quot;Confort&quot; in 1987, at least in the French domestic market. This is also when the 1.6 petrol option was discontinued. The GR received an version of the 504&#x27;s 1.8-liter petrol engine, while the GRD had the 2.3-liter diesel. The French models were then renamed &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; in 1988 (by now with a 2.1 Diesel) and was upgraded to the 2.3-liter diesel for 1990. Trim levels received differing names in various markets; in Britain, most later 504 Pickups received &quot;GL&quot; badging. For 1995 and 1996, subsequent to the end of pickup production in France, Argentinian 504 Pickups were exported to France. These can be recognized by the large modernized front bumper and redesigned dashboard.

==Mechanical configuration==
The car was rear-wheel drive, with longitudinally mounted engines, canted over to bring a lower bonnet line to the styling. Manual and automatic transmissions were offered. The suspension system consisted of MacPherson struts at the front and mainly coil springs at the rear. Sedan, coupé, and cabriolet models additionally had rear semi-trailing arms whereas wagons and pickups had a simpler live rear axle with coils or heavy-duty leaf springs respectively. Most 504 models used a torque tube driveline. With long suspension travel and great strength, the 504 was suited to rough road conditions, and the car proved extremely reliable in conditions found in Africa, Asia, Australia and the like.

The car used disc brakes at the front, and either disc brakes or drum brakes at the rear, depending on the model. Brake pad wear warning via an instrument panel indicator light was a notable innovation. The steering was a rack and pinion system. The Peugeot 504 was widely available with diesel engines and an automatic transmission option, which was a rare combination at the time. Engines were of the design and included 1948 cc, 2112 cc, and a 2304 cc. The Indenor engine was also used in dozens of other automobiles and light commercials as well as for marine applications.

There were three petrol engines available in Europe, 1796 cc and 1971 cc four cylinder and a 2664 cc V6. The two-litre engine was also available with Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection, first available on the earlier Peugeot 404. Gearboxes were either the BA7, four-speed manual or ZF three-speed automatic. Later pickup trucks in Europe gained a fifth gear. Export market vehicles had different variations available.

==Politics==
In 1976, the Government of Sri Lanka purchased a large number of Peugeot 504s for use of dignitaries attending the Fifth Non-Aligned Movement summit in Colombo.

In November 2010. Iranian state television announced Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was to auction off his 1977 Peugeot 504 to raise money for charity. The car is white with a sky-blue interior, and has covered only 37,000 km since new. The political significance of the car being a 504 is that it was used as a working-class status symbol to draw electoral support from the less well-off during the 2005 presidential campaign. The money earned from the sale at international auction is to be donated to the Mehr housing project, a network of cooperatives that provides affordable housing for low-income families. Soon after being put on auction in January 2011, a bid of $1 million was received from &quot;an Arab country&quot;. When the auction closed in March 2011, the final bid was $2.5 million.

<text>The Baptist Union of Denmark () is a Baptist Christian denomination in Denmark. It is a member of the European Baptist Federation, the Baptist World Alliance, and the World Council of Churches. Headquarters of the Union are maintained in Copenhagen.

==History==

The first work in Denmark generally considered Baptist began in 1836 when Julius Köbner, a Danish Jew, visited Hamburg, Germany and met some individuals with Baptist views. Köbner was an associate and co-worker of Johann Gerhard Oncken (1800–1884), often considered the father of European Baptists. Oncken baptized these believers and established a church in Copenhagen in 1839. Until 1849, when religious liberty was granted through the Constitution of 1849, Baptists were fined, imprisoned, and their infants baptized by compulsion. The Baptists were instrumental in the obtaining of religious freedom in Denmark.

The Baptist Union was formed in 1849, and remained a part of the German Baptist Union until 1888. In that year, it was reorganized, influenced by the emigration of Danish Baptists to the United States, and the returning influence of American Baptists on the Danish. The New Hampshire Confession of Faith was adopted in place of the &quot;German Confession of 1847&quot;. A number of Danish pastors studied at Morgan Park Seminary in Chicago, Illinois. In 1918, they established their own theological seminary.

Doctrinally, the Danish Baptists have evolved from a generally Calvinistic &quot;closed&quot; Baptist tradition to a more Arminian ecumenical body. Open communion has been practiced since the 1930s. 

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 4,937 members and 54 churches. 

The theological seminary is located in Tølløse.

<text>Pinchus Krémègne, aka Pinchus Kremegne (; ; 28 July 1890 – 5 April 1981), was a Lithuanian Belarusian Jewish-French artist, primarily known as a sculptor, painter and lithographer.

== Biography and Art ==
He was a native of Zhaludak near Lida, now Belarus, and was a friend of both Chaïm Soutine and Michel Kikoine. He studied sculpture at the Vilnius Academy of Art. He became a target of the pogroms because he was a Jew and fled to Paris in 1912. In Paris, Krémègne joined the group of painters of Montparnasse and soon became one of the respected residents of La Ruche. In 1915, he gave up sculpture in order to dedicate himself to painting. It was he who encouraged Soutine to come to Paris. In Montparnasse he met several other prominent Jewish painters of the School of Paris including Isaac Frenkel and Michel Kikoine.
He left Paris to live in a small town in the Pyrenees called Ceret. This village, which is a little inland from Collioure, attracted other painters such as Soutine. Although Soutine did not like the town very much, he completed many paintings there over a couple of years. He never settled but his compatriot Krémègne had a house built there around 1960. This small unassuming house, a reflection of the man himself, is nestled into the mountain and overlooks the village.

There was a falling out between the two men perhaps stemming from some ingratitude shown by Soutine towards a mutual &#x27;mecene&#x27; or benefactor who had helped out the two impoverished artists during their early careers in Paris. Krémègne&#x27;s house has new occupants and it is called &quot;La Miranda del Convent&quot;. Later Ceret was to attract other painters such as Picasso. The Picasso walk meanders by Krémègne&#x27;s house and Ceret has an important museum exhibiting artists such as Matisse, Picasso, and others. There are a few Krémègne paintings on exhibition there as well.

Krémègne died in Ceret.

== Legacy ==

Underestimated as an artist today, he is overshadowed by Soutine and Chagall. He was remembered with a posthumous one-man show in the &quot;Quartier Les Halles&quot; in Paris in the 1990s. A more structured vision of nature than Soutine&#x27;s, Krémègne&#x27;s last paintings prefigure the work of painters such as Leon Kossoff and Frank Auerbach in England.

<text>The Focke-Wulf Ta 152 is a German high-altitude fighter–interceptor designed by Kurt Tank and produced by Focke-Wulf. It entered production too late and in insufficient numbers to have a significant role in the Second World War.

The Ta 152 was a development of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter. It was intended to be produced in at least three versions—the Ta 152H (high-altitude fighter); the Ta 152C designed for medium-altitude operations and ground-attack, using a Daimler-Benz DB 603 and with smaller wings and the Ta 152E fighter–reconnaissance aircraft with the engine of the H model and the wing of the C model. The first Ta 152H entered service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in January 1945, one month later, production of the Ta 152 had ceased due to Germany&#x27;s declining position in the conflict. Japan acquired material from Germany towards establishing domestic production of the Ta 152, but no aircraft were ever believed to have been completed.

==Development==
===Fw 190===
The Fw 190&#x27;s BMW 801 engine was originally designed for bomber and transport aircraft flying at medium altitudes in the range. In keeping with this role it used a relatively simple single-stage supercharger that lacked performance above altitude. This presented a problem for fighter use, where high-altitude performance was desirable. Through careful tuning, the Fw 190 instead emerged as a powerful medium altitude design. Several experimental models of the Fw 190 with different engines were tested with improved high altitude performance, but these were not high priority projects.

Allied heavy bombers and escort fighters began flying operations at higher altitudes, around . At these altitudes, the Fw 190 found itself at a disadvantage, which became acute during early 1944 when the long range P-51 Mustang arrived in quantity. This led to the introduction of the Fw 190D-9, mounting the Junkers Jumo 213E engine. This engine had a two-stage supercharger and much better altitude performance. The rest of the aircraft&#x27;s design, especially the relatively short wings, made it difficult to fly at high altitudes. While the D-9 upgrade was expedient, it was not ideal.

===High-altitude fighters===
Rumours of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which would cruise at altitudes at which no German aircraft could comfortably operate, added impetus for a dedicated high-altitude design. The (RLM, German Air Ministry) requested proposals from Focke-Wulf and Messerschmitt for a high-altitude interceptor. Messerschmitt responded with the Bf 109H while Focke-Wulf submitted a range of designs; the Fw 190 &quot;Raffat-1&quot; (Ra-1) fighter would replace the existing Fw 190D series, the Ra-2 was a dedicated high altitude fighter, and the Ra-3 was a ground-attack aircraft.

These designs developed into the Fw 190 V20 (Ta 152A), V21 (Ta 152B) and V30 (Ta 152H) prototypes, all of which were based on the Fw 190D-9 but with varying degrees of improvement. The V20 used the same Jumo 213E engine as the Fw 190D-9, while the V21 used the DB 603E. Neither of these offered any significant improvement over the Fw 190D-9, and further development of the Ta 152A and B was cancelled. The V21 airframe was further modified as the V21/U1 and became the prototype for the Ta 152C.

In 1944, the (German Air Ministry) decided that new fighter aircraft titles must include the chief designer&#x27;s name. The aircraft design was therefore given the prefix Ta.

===Japanese version===
During April 1945, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS) acquired the licence, along with schemes and technical drawings, for manufacturing the Ta 152 in Japan. During the last stages of the conflict in Germany, with the plight of the Japanese armed forces growing ever bleaker, a large volume of the latest aviation technology Germany had to offer was given to or bought by the air wings of both the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy in the hopes that it would stem the tide of defeats and ever increasing pressure by the superior Allied air forces.

==Design==
Kurt Tank originally designed the Ta 152 using the 44.52 litre displacement Daimler-Benz DB 603 engine as it offered better high-altitude performance and also a greater developmental potential. The DB 603 had been used in the Fw 190C prototypes but had many problems and was considered too difficult to fit in the Ta 152 by RLM officials. With this in mind, Tank focused his efforts on the 213E as the Ta 152H engine. He insisted that the DB 603 be retained for the Ta 152C versions and as an option for later versions of the Ta 152H.

Due to the changes in the center of gravity and balance caused by the heavier engine and the lengthened nose, the Ta 152&#x27;s fuselage was extended aft by 30 Centimeters compared to the Fw 190D-9 fuselage. Internal equipment was also relocated to correct that imbalance. The empennage was also modified with wider-chord fixed vertical tail surfaces. (especially the top half), Hydraulic rather than electrically controlled Landing gear/undercarriage and flaps were substituted to help correcting that CoG condition. The D-9 retained the wingspan of the original pre-war Fw 190 models, but this was slightly extended for the C model to , and greatly extended for the H model to , which gave it much better control at high altitudes at the cost of speed at lower altitudes.

Due to the conflict&#x27;s impact on aluminium availability, the wing was built around a pair of steel spars, the front extending from just past the landing gear attachment points, and the rear spar spanning the entire wing. The wing was designed with 3° of washout, from the root to the flap–aileron junction, to prevent the ailerons from stalling before the centre section of the wing.

The Ta 152 also featured the FuG 16ZY and FuG 25a radio equipment (some aircraft were issued with FuG 125 Hermine D/F for navigation and blind landing, LGW-Siemens K 23 autopilot, and a heated armoured glass windscreen for bad-weather operations).

===High-altitude features===
To reach higher altitudes, a pressurized cockpit was added to the Ta 152H. The canopy was sealed by a circular tube filled with rubber foam which was inflated by a compressed air bottle, while the engine compartment was also sealed from the cockpit with a rubber foam ring. A Knorr 300/10 air compressor provided the pressure, maintaining the cockpit at 0.37 Bar (5.29 psi) above . To prevent fogging, the windscreen was of a double-glazed style with a thick outer pane and a inner pane with a gap. The gap was fitted with several silica gel capsules to absorb any moisture forming between the panes. The cockpit was not pressurized in the Ta 152C.

===Armament===
The Ta 152H had heavy armament to allow it to deal quickly with enemy aircraft. It had a MK 108 in the propeller hub and two MG 151/20 cannon, synchronised to fire through the propeller, in the wing roots. The C model was designed to operate at lower altitudes than the H-model with the same armament plus two more MG 151/20 cannon synchronised as the additional autocannon for the C-model were mounted just ahead of the windscreen and above the engine&#x27;s upper rear crank case. The Ta 152C could destroy the heaviest enemy bombers with a short burst but the added weight decreased speed and rate of turn.

===Performance===
The Ta 152H-1 was among the fastest piston-engined fighters of the war, with a top speed comparable to the twin-engined Dornier Do 335. It was capable of at using the GM-1 nitrous oxide boost and at sea level using the MW 50 methanol-water boost. It used the MW 50 system mainly for altitudes up to about and the GM-1 system for higher altitudes, although both systems could be engaged at the same time. Kurt Tank was flying an unarmed Ta 152H in late 1944 to a meeting at the Focke-Wulf plant in Cottbus when ground controllers warned him of two P-51 Mustangs. The enemy aircraft appeared behind Tank but he escaped by applying full power and engaging the MW 50 boost &quot;until they were no more than two dots on the horizon&quot;.

==Operational history==

By October 1944, given the disastrous course of the conflict, RLM realised the urgency of Germany&#x27;s situation and pushed Focke-Wulf to quickly put the Ta 152 into production. As a result, several Ta 152 prototypes crashed early into the test program. It was found that critical systems were lacking sufficient quality control. Problems arose with superchargers, pressurised cockpits leaked, the engine cooling system was unreliable at best due in part to unreliable oil temperature monitoring and in several instances the landing gear failed to properly retract. A total of up to 20 pre-production Ta 152 H-0s were delivered from November 1944 to Ta 152 to service test the aircraft. It was reported that test pilots were able to conduct a mere 31 hours of flight tests before full production started. By the end of January 1945, only 50 hours or so had been completed.

III./, initially a Luftwaffe unit, was ordered to convert to the type in January 1945, which it did (and flew them operationally for a short time). In the end, Ta 152s were pooled in a special JG 301, first based at Alteno Air Base near Luckau, then at Neustadt-Glewe in Mecklenburg. The never had more than 15 Ta 152Hs, H-0s and H-1s. Since the usual transfer system had broken down, replacement parts became nearly impossible to obtain.

An early Ta 152 combat occurred on 14 April 1945 when Willi Reschke tried to intercept a De Havilland Mosquito over Stendal but failed to catch up due to engine trouble. On the evening of that same day, Reschke was to demonstrate that the Ta 152H could be used as a low altitude fighter. A section of four Hawker Tempest Vs of 486 (NZ) Squadron were out on patrol. After attacking a train near Ludwigslust, the section split up into pairs; Wing Commander Brooker ordered the Tempests flown by Flying Officer S. J. Short and Warrant Officer Owen J. Mitchell to make their own way back to base. On the way back, this pair, which was strafing targets along the railway tracks near Ludwigslust, was spotted by lookouts posted at Neustadt-Glewe. Three Ta 152s – flown by Reschke, Aufhammer and Sepp Sattler – were scrambled, catching the Tempests by surprise. Reschke recalled,

It is assumed that Sattler was shot down either by Sid Short or Bill Shaw of 486 Sqn, who claimed a Bf 109 E in the same area. Operational missions were flown in April 1945 from Neustadt, mostly escorting close support aircraft to the Battle of Berlin. Reschke claimed two Yakovlev Yak-9s near Berlin on 24 April, while Obfw. Walter Loos, claimed four air victories on 24, 25 and 30 April.

The Ta 152 score at the end of the war was probably seven victories and four losses in air combat, although a degree of uncertainty about those numbers exists. Four victories were achieved by Josef Keil, from 1 March 1945 to 21 April 1945, and at least three victories were achieved by Willi Reschke. The Ta 152 was delivered to JG 301 on 27 January 1945 and the first Ta 152 mission against American bombers took place on 2 March 1945. There was no contact with the Americans because the 12 Ta 152s were forced to fend off repeated attacks by the Bf 109s of another German unit, as the shape of the Ta-152 was virtually unknown to other . There were no losses, as the climbing ability and manoeuvrability of the Ta 152s enabled them to evade these attacks. The four losses in air combat were: Hptm. Hermann Stahl, killed on 11 April 1945; Obfw. Sepp Sattler, killed on 14 April 1945; two unknown JG11 pilots, downed by Spitfires in the last days of April 1945 during transfer from Neustadt-Glewe to Leck airfield.

==Production==
The aviation historian Malcolm Lowe noted: 

The total number of Ta 152s produced is unknown. According to the aviation historian Chris McNab, the first production examples of the Ta 152H commenced delivery during November 1944 and, by the time the factory was abandoned in early 1945, 150 examples had been delivered to the Luftwaffe and that the majority of these aircraft were issued to JG 301. Allegedly, production of the Ta 152 had abruptly ceased by February 1945. However, according to Peter Rodeike, 44 Ta 152 H-0/V and 25 Ta 152 H-1 were completed.

==Variants==
;Ta 152 C-0
:Pre-production aircraft, one prototype built powered with 2,100-hp (1566 kW) Daimler Benz DB603LA engine. The extra length of this engine, as with the Jumo 213-powered Fw 190D-9, required a compensating rear fuselage plug and enlarged tail surfaces, and wing span was increased to 36 ft 1 in (11 meters). All &quot;C&quot; variants were intended for low to medium-altitude operations.
;Ta 152 C-1
:Standard wing (11.00 m (36 ft 1 in)), armed with one engine-mounted &quot;Motorkanone&quot; 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon and four 20 mm synchronized MG 151/20 cannons (two above the engine, two in the wing roots).
;Ta 152 C-2
:Standard wing (11.00 m (36 ft 1 in)), equipped with an improved radio.
;Ta 152 C-3
:Standard wing (11.00 m (36 ft 1 in)), armed with one engine-mounted &quot;Motorkanone&quot; 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 103 cannon and four 20 mm synchronized MG 151/20 cannons (two above the engine, two in the wing roots).
;Ta 152 E-1
:Photographic reconnaissance version of the Ta 152C, with standard wing (11.00 m (36 ft 1 in)).
;Ta 152 E-2
:High-altitude photographic reconnaissance version, powered by a Junkers Jumo 213E engine and with the H-series wing (14.44 m (48 ft 6 in)). Only a single prototype was completed.
;Ta 152 H-0
:20 pre-production aircraft, H-series wing (14.44 m (48 ft 6 in)). All &quot;H&quot; variants were intended for medium to high altitude operations.
;Ta 152 H-1
:The only production version. H-series wing (14.44 m (48 ft 6 in)), armed with one engine-mounted &quot;Motorkanone&quot; 30 mm (1.18 in) MK108 cannon and two 20 mm synchronized MG 151/20 cannons in the wing roots, additional fuel tanks located in the wings.

==Surviving aircraft==
Only one Ta 152 survives, a 152 H-0 variant flown by III./ 301, a Luftwaffe unit. The aircraft is housed at the National Air and Space Museum Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland, United States, where it is expected to be restored.

The aircraft is believed to be Werk-Nummer (serial number) 150020, which was a pre-production H-0 model transitioning to full production Ta 152H-1 series aircraft. It was probably built at Focke-Wulf&#x27;s production facility at Cottbus, Germany, in December 1944, and delivered to Erprobungskommando Ta 152 at Rechlin, Germany, for service testing.

<text>Krajenka () is a town in the Greater Poland Voivodeship of Poland. It has 3,804 inhabitants (2005) and lies in Złotów County.

== Geographical location ==
Krajenka is located approximately 15 kilometers south of Złotów, 50 kilometers south-east of Szczecinek and 160 kilometers east of the regional center, Szczecin. It is located on the river, a tributary of the Gwda river. It is part of the ethnographic region of Krajna, located in the northern part of the historic Greater Poland region.

== History ==

The first mention of the town is from 1286, back then it belonged to noble family of Danaborski whose Coat of Arms was Toporczyk. The name of the town itself comes from the Polish word Krajna, which meant in the past a location on the borders of Polish state. Throughout centuries it was connected to Polish royalty and such families as Danaborski, Dahlke, Kościelecki, Grudziński, Działyński, Sułkowski, Komierowski.

Magdeburg city rights were granted in 1420 by the Polish king Władysław Jagiełło.

Following the First Partition of Poland, in 1772 it was annexed by Prussia. In 1787 the city suffered a fire. After the last Polish owner of the town was killed by the Prussians in 1807, the town was confiscated by Prussian officials and passed from Polish to German hands. In 1846 a Protestant church was built by the famous German architect Carl Friedrich Schinkel. In 1871 a railway station of the Prussian Eastern Railway was built south of the river. The town was then the property of Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia. According to the German census of 1890, the town had a population of 3,344, of which 400 (12%) were Poles.

Despite the policy of Germanisation, local Poles in the early 20th century founded the People&#x27;s Bank and a Polish Catholic Society. After Poland regained independence in 1918, the Polish inhabitants made efforts to reintegrate the town with Poland, but despite their requests and protests, the Treaty of Versailles granted the town to Germany. Then it was made part of the province of Grenzmark Posen-Westpreußen. On 21 June 1924, the town made history within German law as the Reichsgericht confirmed private ownership by Prinz Friedrich Leopold, including, where he died in 1931. In 1931, local Poles founded a Polish school. Its teacher, Franciszek Gliszewski, was arrested and murdered by the Germans in the Flossenbürg concentration camp after the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

On 30 January 1945 the Soviet Red Army occupied the abandoned and severely destroyed town during the final stages of World War II. Many of the inhabitants had fled during the winter of 1944/1945. After the war the town was finally reintegrated with Poland under the Potsdam Agreement.

The works in the series are as follows, in internal chronological order.
== Planet Majipoor ==
Majipoor is a planet much larger than Earth, though far less dense, so that its surface gravity is almost the same as on Earth. It has been settled by humans, Ghayrogs, Skandars, Vroons, Liimen, Hjorts and other alien races for many thousands of years. The aboriginal inhabitants of the planet, the Piurivar, were conquered by humans many thousands of years ago and are now confined to a reservation. The planet is ruled by an unusual tetrarchy of Powers: an adoptive &quot;Coronal&quot; rules in a highly visible and symbolic manner from his palace atop Castle Mount; the previous Coronal retires to become the &quot;Pontifex&quot;, the head of the bureaucracy in an underground Labyrinth; the Coronal&#x27;s mother becomes the &quot;Lady of the Isle of Sleep&quot;, promoting the morals of Majipoor by sending dreams to its inhabitants; while a hereditary &quot;King of Dreams&quot; on the distant continent of Suvrael punishes wrongdoers by visiting them with nightmares. The post of King of Dreams is created at the end of &quot;King of Dreams&quot;, while &quot;Valentine Pontifex&quot; ends with the creation of a fifth Power, representing the Piurivar.

Majipoor receives the occasional starship, but is generally considered a backwater planet. Metals of all sorts are scarce, since the planet has a very light crust. Technology is pervasive but often of ancient origin and no longer fully understood. For example, draft animals called &quot;mounts&quot; are used for farming and transport, but the animals were artificially created in the distant past by genetic manipulation, and the technologies involved have been forgotten. Many great engineering works are described, but these were also usually created long ago. Many modern technologies, such as TV and radio, seem to be nonexistent or in very limited use. The average Majipooran lives a peasant lifestyle, and agriculture is a common occupation.

== Races ==
There are several races which inhabit Majipoor in the millions, along with various aliens visiting from off-world. Ancient laws dictate that no race may exclusively occupy a given district, so most races can be found in some numbers virtually anywhere. On the village level, there are monocultures, however. Some areas also have a small number of other intelligent beings visiting from off-world. There are also indigenous sea dragons, discovered to be highly intelligent.

;Humans
:The primary inhabitants of Majipoor. Apparently, the ruling hierarchy are drawn exclusively from human families and humans were the first race to colonize the planet (then occupied only by a few million Shapeshifters). In the various Majipoor books, humans are also the primary economic force. The vast majority of nobles, wealthy merchants and landowners are human. The Coronal, Pontifex, Lady of the Isle of Sleep, and King of Dreams are all humans, as are the bulk of their respective staffs. Occasionally a Vroon, Hjort or Su-Suheris will become a key advisor to a Coronal or Pontifex.

;Vroons
:A smallish, somewhat octopus-like race. Many are wizards, and they are known for the direction-finding and healing arts. Some can see the future in a limited way.

;Hjorts
:A squat, bipedal race with bulging eyes and grey lumpy skin. While unattractive in appearance, they provide the bulk of the bureaucracy that keeps the vast and complex society of Majipoor operating. Some engage in mercantile activities, as well.

;Skandars
:A four-armed, shaggy, tall and very strong race. They can be found as cargo-handlers, teamsters and sailing ship crew. A few Skandars take up juggling, and with four arms they are unparalleled at this art. Skandars are known to be obstinate and hot-headed.

;Liimen
:A three-eyed race of lesser intelligence that perform menial work such as fishing, selling grilled meats, or janitorial tasks. No Liimen are mentioned as higher-ups in the government or as businessmen.

;Su-Suheris
:A mysterious tall folk with two small heads on a single neck. Through an unknown mechanism, both heads share a single consciousness. A few are great sorcerers or advisers to men of power in the government. Some Su-Suheris have psychic powers and are capable of seeing the future. They tend to be fairly aloof, and perhaps consider themselves better than the other races.

;Ghayrogs
:A bipedal race with reptilian features, forked tongues, and black serpentine hair. While their population is concentrated in the crystal city of Dulorn, Ghayrogs can be found throughout much of Majipoor, some serving as high government functionaries. They generally display little or no emotion and do not sleep most of the year. Ghayrogs are egg-layers, but mammalian despite their scaly skins.

;Piurivar (also called Metamorphs or Shapeshifters)
:The original race occupying Majipoor. They were none too pleased when humans began colonizing the planet, and a smoldering guerrilla war lasted for many centuries before the Coronal Lord Stiamot rounded up and evicted the Metamorphs from Alhanroel, restricting them to a reservation on Zimroel. Normally bipedal, with flat faces and green/grey skin, the Shapeshifters have the ability to mimic virtually any bipedal race. When so disguised, they are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. This aided them greatly in their struggles with human colonists early in Majipoor&#x27;s history. Eventually, techniques were devised to detect Metamorphs, and they were confined largely to a vast reservation on Zimroel. But the intelligent beings have never stopped dreaming of a day when they would retake the planet from the various other sentient species which now inhabit it.

== Geography ==
The characters of any given book often travel vast distances across the face of Majipoor. The planet itself has three main continents, a major island, several smaller islands of note, and one hemisphere which is the &quot;Great Sea&quot; (entirely water).

;Alhanroel
:The first continent settled by humans from &quot;Old Earth&quot; (as it is known). In many of the tales in the series, it is the more populous of the continents, though this is likely not the case by the time of &quot;Lord Valentine&#x27;s Castle&quot; and sequels. The centers of government, the Castle and Labyrinth, are located here. Many of the princely families from whom the Coronal is typically chosen reside in Alhanroel. Residents of Alhanroel (especially those of status) consider themselves superior to those of Zimroel. People from Alhanroel tend to call the Piurivar &quot;Metamorphs&quot; and have a particular accent to their speech.

;Castle Mount
:Alhanroel is home to Castle Mount, a huge mountain 30 miles tall. It is so tall that its summit is above most of the atmosphere and originally existed in the vacuum of outer space. Using force fields and &quot;weather machines&quot; the mountain is now inhabitable with a bucolic climate, and is home to millions of people who live in the Fifty Cities of the Mount. At the summit is the Coronal&#x27;s Castle, which is referred to as &quot;Lord (current Coronal&#x27;s) Castle&quot;. Since each Coronal is expected to add a room or structure to the Castle, it is huge indeed.

;Labyrinth
:Home of the Pontifex, who is succeeded by the then-current Coronal. This strange city is in a desert region and is built almost entirely below ground. Many layers beneath the ground, the bureaucracy that actually &quot;runs&quot; Majipoor is busy with their statistical analyses and other &quot;official&quot; paperwork. The Pontifex himself, technically the top executive of the planet, spends most of the remainder of his life here except for occasional excursions.

;Zimroel
:Not settled until later in Majipoor&#x27;s history, and many areas remain a mystery to humans. In some of the earliest &quot;Majipoor&quot; tales, only certain natural harbor towns held any significant settlement, though by the time of &quot;Lord Valentine&quot; many parts are densely populated indeed. Zimroel is larger than Alhanroel, and Lord Valentine&#x27;s journey across the continent took many months. The Coronal and Pontifex have less influence here as well, with the Procurator of Ni-Moya being a more direct overlord (until that office was abolished). There is a sense that Zimroel is more of a series of city states than a unified whole. Zimroel-born folk call the Piurivar &quot;Shapeshifters&quot; and appear to have a distinct accent considered inferior by those from Alhanroel.

;Isle of Sleep
:A very large, circular island surrounded by white cliffs which lies between Alhanroel and Zimroel in the Inner Sea. On most planets, it would be considered a continent in its own right. The &quot;Lady of Sleep&quot;, who by tradition is the Coronal&#x27;s oldest living female relative (usually mother or aunt) uses ancient dream-sending machines to instruct and guide the citizens of the planet in their sleep. It must work, as Majipoor has rarely encountered the kind of violence found on other worlds. Initiates of all races from across the planet come to the Isle to serve the Lady and find inner peace. There are only two small ports servicing the Isle, which is really quite self-sufficient.

;Suvrael
:A very hot southern continent. Much of it is desert, though grazing-land for herd animals is also plentiful. It is home to the &quot;Barjazid&quot; family, who managed to obtain dream-sending equipment of their own during the time of Lord Prestimion, and the &quot;King of Dreams&quot; was soon recognized as a Power in his own right. He uses his unique capabilities to punish evildoers with nightmares.

<doc id="456477" wikidata="Q7612411" url="?curid=456477" title="Steve Donoghue">
<text>Steve Donoghue (8 November 188423 March 1945) was a leading English flat-race jockey in the 1910s and 1920s. He was Champion Jockey 10 times between 1914 and 1923 and was one of the most celebrated horse racing sportsmen after Fred Archer, with only Sir Gordon Richards and Sir Tony McCoy eclipsing him.

==Background==
Stephen Donoghue was born in Warrington, Lancashire. His father was a steel-worker and the family had no racing connections. At the age of twelve he left home and decided to become a jockey after winning a prize for riding a donkey at a circus. Donoghue was apprenticed to John Porter when he was 14 years old, but ran away after being beaten for allowing a horse to get loose on the gallops. After working as an apprentice and work rider at two other British stables he accepted an offer to ride in France. In 1905 he rode his first winner at Hyères, before moving to Ireland in 1907 and returning to England in 1911.

==Career==

Donoghue accepted the post of stable jockey to Henry Seymour &quot;Atty&quot; Persse at Stockbridge, Hampshire and had his first major successes in 1913 on the outstanding two-year-old The Tetrarch. In the following year he rode 129 winners to claim the first of ten consecutive jockeys&#x27; championships.

His greatest triumphs came in The Derby which he won six times. The three consecutive wins in the early 1920s – on Humorist (1921), Captain Cuttle (1922) and Papyrus (1923) – were the high points. He was also associated with the horse Brown Jack – who he rode to six consecutive wins in the Queen Alexandra Stakes at Royal Ascot.

In 1915 and 1917, he rode the horses Pommern and Gay Crusader to the English Triple Crown. In its more than two-hundred-year history, of the jockeys aboard the fifteen winners, Steve Donoghue is the only one to have ever won the Triple Crown twice.

Always popular with the public and his fellow professionals, Donoghue was never called up by the stewards. He was less popular with owners and trainers because of his tendency to switch allegiance when he had the opportunity of a winning ride.

==Retirement==
He retired from riding at the age of 52 in 1937, a year in which he won two classics on the filly Exhibitionnist. Also in 1937, he appeared as himself in &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot;, Britain&#x27;s first Technicolour film. Despite earning a great deal during his career his &quot;impulsive generosity&quot; and lack of business acumen led to financial difficulties. He took up training at Blewbury but had little success. Donoghue died in London on 23 March 1945 from a heart attack.

In 1999, the &quot;Racing Post&quot; ranked Donoghue as fourth in their list of the Top 50 jockeys of the 20th century.

<doc id="456478" wikidata="Q6492865" url="?curid=456478" title="Lascelles Principles">
<text>The Lascelles Principles are a constitutional convention in the United Kingdom beginning in 1950, under which the sovereign can refuse a request from the prime minister to dissolve Parliament if three conditions are met:
#if the existing Parliament is still &quot;vital, viable, and capable of doing its job&quot;, 
#if a general election would be &quot;detrimental to the national economy&quot;, and
#if the sovereign could &quot;rely on finding another prime minister who could govern for a reasonable period with a working majority in the House of Commons&quot;.

The convention was in abeyance from 2011 to 2022, when the sovereign&#x27;s prerogative power to dissolve Parliament was removed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. Following passage of the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, which repealed the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, these principles are thought to have been revived.

The Lascelles principles are not the only convention governing how the sovereign makes decisions relating to changes of government. For example, the Cabinet Manual notes the historic precedent of the sovereign dismissing a government under reserve powers. However, this was last done by William IV, who dismissed Lord Melbourne’s government despite majority support in the Commons and is thought to have damaged the sovereign’s reputation.

The general principles of government formation also affect this decision. The Cabinet Manual stresses that the monarch should not be exposed to political decisions and &quot;it remains a matter for the Prime Minister, as the Sovereign&#x27;s principal adviser, to judge the appropriate time at which to resign&quot;. The Manual notes that recent Prime Ministers have chosen not to resign until an established situation was set which the sovereign could be advised to accept.

== The letter ==
During public discussion of George VI&#x27;s potential response to the outcome of the 1950 general election, which returned a very slim Labour Party majority in the House of Commons, the Lascelles Principles were formally stated in a letter to the Editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, written by the King’s Private Secretary Sir Alan Lascelles, and published on 2 May 1950, under the pseudonym &quot;Senex&quot;:
To the Editor of The Times

Sir, It is surely indisputable (and common sense) that a Prime Minister may ask—not demand—that his Sovereign will grant him a dissolution of Parliament; and that the Sovereign, if he so chooses, may refuse to grant this request. The problem of such a choice is entirely personal to the Sovereign, though he is, of course, free to seek informal advice from anybody whom he thinks fit to consult.

In so far as this matter can be publicly discussed, it can be properly assumed that no wise Sovereign—that is, one who has at heart the true interest of the country, the constitution, and the Monarchy—would deny a dissolution to his Prime Minister unless he were satisfied that: (1) the existing Parliament was still vital, viable, and capable of doing its job; (2) a General Election would be detrimental to the national economy; (3) he could rely on finding another Prime Minister who could carry on his Government, for a reasonable period, with a working majority in the House of Commons. When Sir Patrick Duncan refused a dissolution to his Prime Minister in South Africa in 1939, all these conditions were satisfied: when Lord Byng did the same in Canada in 1926, they appeared to be, but in the event the third proved illusory.

I am, &amp;c.,

SENEX.

April 29.
==Subsequent discussion==
Historian Peter Hennessy stated in 1994 that the second of the three conditions had since been &quot;dropped from the canon&quot;, being no longer included in internal Cabinet Office guidance.

<text>Carnival of Carnage is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse, released on October 18, 1992, by Psychopathic Records.

Recording sessions for the album took place from 1991 to 1992 at Miller Midi Productions and The Tempermill Studio. The album is the first Joker&#x27;s Card in the group&#x27;s Dark Carnival mythology. The album&#x27;s lyrics describe the Carnival of Carnage as a representation of the violence that occurs within the ghettos, which takes the form of a traveling carnival to enact the same brutality on the upper class.

&quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; was the first album on which Insane Clown Posse collaborated with producer Mike E. Clark, who would work with the group throughout much of their career. It features guest appearances by popular Detroit rappers Esham and Kid Rock. The album features the only recorded appearances of member John Kickjazz, who left the group prior to the album&#x27;s release. Although the album did not initially sell well, it became eligible for gold certification by the RIAA in 2010.

==Conception==

===Background===

Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler formed a hip hop group in 1990. Under the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, the group began performing at local night clubs under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse. By late 1991, the group had invested more money into production than was covered by returns. They decided that their gangsta rap style was the cause of the problem: most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Bruce suggested the band instead adapt a style similar to the hallucinatory, surrealistic &quot;acid rap&quot; of fellow Detroit rapper Esham, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as Los Angeles represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about Satan, which Esham often did.

After the change in musical style, the group decided that it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the &quot;I.C.P.&quot; initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct, an idea to which the group agreed. Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became the inspiration for the group&#x27;s new name, Insane Clown Posse. The other members agreed, deciding that they would take on this new genre and name, and would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted hype man.

===Recording===
&quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; began recording at Miller Midi Productions in Detroit, Michigan with Chuck Miller producing and mastering the album. Miller charged the group US$6,000 to produce the songs &quot;Red Neck Hoe,&quot; &quot;Psychopathic,&quot; &quot;Your Rebel Flag,&quot; and part of &quot;Night of the Axe.&quot; Seeing that they were being overcharged, Alex Abbiss made his first major managerial move by finding another producer, Mike E. Clark. The group finished recording the album with Clark at The Tempermill Studio in Ferndale, Michigan. Clark mastered his part of the album at Rythmatic Studio, and continued to work with the group throughout their career.

Original group member John Kickjazz appeared on the songs &quot;Your Rebel Flag&quot;, &quot;Psychopathic&quot;, &quot;Blacken&#x27; Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Wizard of the Hood&quot;, &quot;Red Neck Hoe&quot; and &quot;Taste&quot;. &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; was originally recorded by Esham at Hells Doors Studio, but he pronounced &quot;carnage&quot; as &quot;carnicks&quot; and refused to redo it. The final version of the song was recorded by Joseph Bruce over a reversed recording of the original.

Awesome Dre was originally going to do a verse on &quot;Taste.&quot; While Insane Clown Posse waited in the studio for him to arrive, Esham suggested that he appear on the track instead for the same amount of money, and the group allowed him to record a verse. Esham was paid $500 for his appearance. Kid Rock demanded a hundred more than Esham, and was paid $600 to appear on &quot;Is That You?&quot; He showed up to record the song intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.

===Joker&#x27;s Cards===
&quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; is the first Joker&#x27;s Card in Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s Dark Carnival concept album series. The Dark Carnival is a concept of the afterlife in which souls are sent to a form of limbo while waiting to be sent to heaven or hell based on their individual actions. These concepts are related by Insane Clown Posse in a series of albums called the six Joker&#x27;s Cards. Each of the six Joker&#x27;s Cards relate to a specific character — an entity of the Dark Carnival — that tries to &quot;save the human soul&quot; by showing the wicked inside of one&#x27;s self.

This Joker&#x27;s Card is a representation of the ghettos and the violence that occurs within them. It takes the form of a traveling carnival which releases the same brutality on those who have ignored the inner cities&#x27; cries for help. The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government&#x27;s negligence toward the lower classes. The cover of &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork for the rest of the albums in the Joker&#x27;s Cards series.

===Samples===
Mike Clark samples Johnny &quot;Hammond&quot; Smith&#x27;s &quot;Big Sur Suite&quot;, from Smith&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard&quot;, from their 1970 debut album, the Beastie Boys &quot;Pass the Mic&quot; from their 1992 album Check Your Head, and the drum beat from Champtown&#x27;s &quot;Do Da Dippity&quot; off his 1991/2 12&quot; single Do Da Dippity, in his production of &quot;Never Had It Made.&quot; Joseph Bruce samples several clips from the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in &quot;Wizard of the Hood.&quot; The song &quot;Psychopathic&quot; features a sample of &quot;More Bounce to the Ounce&quot; by Zapp and &quot;&quot;Halloween&quot; theme&quot; from the Halloween film franchise. The song &quot;Redneck Hoe&quot; features a sample from &quot;City, Country, City&quot; by WAR. The song &quot;Taste&quot; samples Esham&#x27;s &quot;Word After Word&quot; from Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell and &quot;Ghetto Freak Show&quot; samples &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Dead&quot; from Judgement Day.

&quot;The Juggla&quot; samples &quot;Kiss&quot; by Prince.

===Lyricism===
Joseph Bruce uses elements of political hip hop throughout the album. Many of his lyrics were derived from his experiences of growing up in a poor family that was neglected by the government. He and his brother Robert used to escape from their impoverished reality by gathering themselves in a forest called &quot;Picker Forest&quot;. Joe cites &quot;Picker Forest&quot; as a strong influence on the Dark Carnival mythology which began with this album. The themes of the Dark Carnival also derived from a dream Bruce had shortly after the group adopted its new name, in which spirits in a traveling carnival appeared to him.

&quot;Red Neck Hoe&quot; and &quot;Your Rebel Flag&quot; stem from the group&#x27;s anti-bigotry philosophy, based on various experiences witnessed by Bruce. As a teenager, he had briefly lived in Bonnie Doone, North Carolina, a trailer park town just outside Fort Bragg, where his brother Robert had been staying with the U.S. Army. There, Joseph witnessed firsthand the hatred and open racism directed toward African American citizens, as well as the minorities serving in the Army, and became disgusted and infuriated with the actions that took place. &quot;Wizard of the Hood&quot; was originally written by Bruce sometime in the late 1980s. The first recorded version of the song appeared on the &quot;Intelligence and Violence&quot; EP under the name &quot;Wizard of Delray.&quot; The &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; version is derived from a 1991 recording which appeared on the EP &quot;Dog Beats&quot;.

==Release==

Just weeks prior to the release of their album, John left the group because he felt that it was &quot;taking up too much of [his] life.&quot; When Bruce and Utsler attempted to call a meeting to talk about the issues, John did not attend. &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; was released on October 18, 1992, with distribution within a radius of Detroit. &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; sold 17 copies on its release date. The number would become a reoccurring theme in Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s work throughout much of the following decade. A condensed extended play featuring tracks from &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; was pressed on vinyl in hopes that DJs would play the songs in Detroit-area nightclubs.

==Reception==

Although &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; was not reviewed at the time of its release, later reviews of the album have been unfavorable. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, comparing the group&#x27;s performance on the album to &quot;a third-rate Beastie Boys supported by a cut-rate Faith No More, all tempered with the sensibility that made GWAR cult heroes—only with [...] more sexism and jokes that are supposed to be street, but wind up sounding racist&quot;, but stating that the album would appeal to fans of the group. In &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;, Martin Charles Strong gave the album four out of ten stars. The album received one star out of five in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, in which Ben Sisario panned it (along with the rest of the group&#x27;s discography before The Great Milenko) as &quot;gangsta-inspired wigga posturing&quot;.

==Legacy==
During a live performance of the song &quot;The Juggla&quot; in 1993, Bruce addressed the audience as &quot;Juggalos&quot;, and the positive response resulted in the group using the word thereafter. The word has been the subject of criticism from both Sisario and Erlewine, who suggested the term is similar to the racial slur &quot;jigaboo.&quot; In 1997, Twiztid released a cover of the song &quot;First Day Out&quot; on the duo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Mostasteless&quot;. In 1998, the album was reissued by Island Records without the tracks &quot;Blackin&#x27; Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Night of the Axe.&quot; The original version continues to be sold by Psychopathic Records. By 2010, the album had sold well enough to become eligible for gold certification by the RIAA. In the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode &quot;Juggalo&quot;, Bruce and Utsler appear as themselves during a trial after Master Shake commits suicide. George Lowe asks &quot;Mr. 2 Dope&quot; to read lyrics from &quot;Blackin&#x27; Your Eyes&quot;.

==25th anniversary==
In mid-2017 it was announced that Insane Clown Posse was going to perform the album in its entirety at the &quot;&quot;El Club&quot; (which holds 600 people), located in southwest Detroit directly across the street from Clark Park right in the heart of ICP&#x27;s stomping ground when they were younger. It was also announced that the performance would only be a one-time event, and tickets would be $250, with all proceeds going directly to the people making the documentary about John Kickjazz titled &quot;The Third Clown&quot;. It was also said that John and Shaggy 2 Dope&#x27;s little brother Tre Pound of Chop Shop would fill in for John. Later on it was announced that for the first time in 25 years Inner City Posse would be performing, and they would wear no makeup. Also a 25th anniversary vinyl version will be available. On August 25, 2017, the lineup for the show was announced, including Rude Boys son DJ Carlito performing (playing music) in between sets, as well as an after party at &quot;MJ&#x27;s&quot;&quot;:

<doc id="456483" wikidata="Q3182489" url="?curid=456483" title="John Sperling">
<text>John Glen Sperling (January 9, 1921 – August 22, 2014) was an American billionaire businessman who is credited with having led the contemporary for-profit education movement in the United States The fortune he amassed was based on his founding of the for-profit University of Phoenix for working adults in 1976, which became part of the publicly traded Apollo Group. Sperling brought the business model of higher education to the forefront, a model that employed the scientific management of higher education to the forefront: diminishing the power and importance of labor, increasing the importance of technology, marketing and advertising, and as University of Phoenix cofounder John D. Murphy explained, maximizing profit. For ventures ranging from pet cloning to green energy, he has widely been described as an &quot;eccentric&quot; self-made man by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and other media.

== Early life and education ==
Sperling was born to a poor sharecropper family in the Missouri Ozarks. His father worked for the railroad and his mother was a fundamentalist Christian. He spent several years as a sailor in the merchant marine, and even as a wandering 1950s beatnik. He received his undergraduate education at Reed College, Portland, Oregon, a master&#x27;s degree from the University of California, Berkeley under the G.I. Bill, and then went on to read for a PhD in economic history at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His doctorate thesis examined 18th-century English mercantile history.

==Entrepreneurship==

===Apollo Group===
Apollo Group () was an S&amp;P 500 corporation based in the South Phoenix area of Phoenix, Arizona. Apollo Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries, owned several for-profit educational institutions before it was acquired by Apollo Global Management and two other companies.

Apollo was founded by John Sperling in 1973. Sperling founded the University of Phoenix in his 50s with no investors and no track record in businesses while facing what he described in his biography as &quot;mean-spirited&quot; opposition from accreditation agencies, competitors, and the press.

The company owned and operated four higher-learning institutions: the University of Phoenix, Western International University, Axia College, the College for Financial Planning, the Institute for Professional Development. It also owned Insight Schools (Online Public High Schools for Washington, Wisconsin, and other locations), and Olympus High School. As of November 2005, the combined enrollment of the four U.S. domestic universities (UOPX, WIU, Axia, CFFP) was approximately 315,350 students. Of these, nearly 90% attended the University of Phoenix, which Apollo Group described as &quot;the nation’s largest regionally accredited private university&quot;.

Additionally, Apollo Group, Inc. was the owner of BPP University in the United Kingdom. It joined forces with Carlyle Group to create Apollo Global for investing in education abroad. Apollo Global also purchased UNIACC college in Santiago, Chile and ULA college in Mexico.

===University of Phoenix===
The University of Phoenix was a for-profit institution of higher learning. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Apollo Group Inc. which was a publicly traded () S&amp;P 500 corporation based in Phoenix, Arizona. The University of Phoenix was founded by John Sperling, who felt that &quot;working adult students were often invisible on traditional campuses and treated as second-class citizens.&quot; Sperling is also quoted as saying &quot;We are not trying to develop [students&#x27;] value systems or go in for that &#x27;expand their minds&#x27; bullshit.&quot; In 1976, it began in Phoenix, with the first class consisted of eight students. In 1980, the school expanded to San Jose, California, and in 1989, the university launched its online program.

The school formerly had an enrollment of 420,700 undergraduate students and 78,000 graduate students, or 224,880 full-time equivalent students. The university had more than 200 campuses worldwide and conferred degrees in over 100 degree programs at the associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral levels. University of Phoenix has an open enrollment admission policy, requiring only a high-school diploma, GED, or its equivalent. The school also provides associate or bachelor&#x27;s degree applicants opportunity for advanced placement through its prior learning assessment, which, aside from previous coursework, college credit can come from experiential learning essays, corporate training, and certificates or licenses.

==Activism==
Before becoming an entrepreneur at age 53, Sperling was a tenured professor at San Jose State University. He was an activist for several liberal causes during the 1960s, such as building a powerful new California faculty union, and was part of several conflicts with authorities and university leaders regarding his experimental adult education schemes.

John Sperling was also an opponent of drug prohibition and was financing initiatives to decriminalize medical marijuana in the United States. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Sperling used marijuana to combat pain caused by the cancer he fought during the 1960s. Together with George Soros, and Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance, Sperling raised considerable amounts of money for drug and other related causes, especially during the 2004 presidential campaign.

==Bio-medical projects==

===Longevity research===
Sperling directed significant amounts of his attention and financial resources toward extending the life span of human beings—research into life extension technology or &quot;biological immortality&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; magazine reported in their February 2004 article &quot;John Sperling Wants You to Live Forever&quot; that his fortune was quickly approaching US$3 billion, and that he had plans to donate it to human biology research if and when he died. It was to be the biggest private program ever devoted to human biology. Sperling since indicated that his fortune would go primarily to environmental causes.

===Cloning===
Sperling provided financing to Genetic Savings &amp; Clone (GS&amp;C), of Sausalito, California, which closed in 2006. He spent seven years and $20 million trying to clone a dog named Missy in a project called Missyplicity. Clones of Missy were produced in December 2007. A subproject of Missyplicity was called Operation CopyCat, which successfully created the first cat clone, named CC.

==Writing==

===&quot;For-profit Higher Education&quot;===
In 1997 Sperling and Robert W Tucker published a book, &quot;For-profit Higher Education: Developing a World-class Workforce&quot;.

Most of the content of this book was derived from a series of internal position papers written by Sperling &amp; Tucker (Tucker was a Senior Vice President). The papers, some 47 in all, were written from 1992 through 1997 to guide the development of the institution to serve the adult-centered market effectively.

Perhaps the most controversial argument made in this book was its analysis of taxpayer costs associated to the three basic models of higher education: public, private (non-profit), and private (for-profit). By accounting not only for direct taxpayer funding associated to the three models, but also for government support to non-profits and, especially, forgone revenue in the non-profit models (including: taxes on endowments; property, sales, use, taxes; federal and state taxes on profit or surplus revenue), Sperling &amp; Tucker&#x27;s model showed that taxpayers realized a profit of several hundred dollars per student per year from a successful for-profit university. The model also showed that taxpayers underwrite costs amounting to several thousand dollars per student per year for students attending public and non-profit institutions. Sperling &amp; Tucker&#x27;s model showed that taxpayers underwrite the highest dollar value for students attending a small number of highly elite institutions, largely because of their very large tax-free endowments.

There are criticisms of Sperling &amp; Tucker&#x27;s economic and financial arguments. At the time this book was published, the student loan default rate for University of Phoenix students was at or below the average for state 4-year institutions. This parity eliminated loan default costs as a significant factor in the analysis. (Although the model included default rates by institution.) Today, the default rate for-profit institutions is above the average for public and non-profit institutions, leading critics to argue that the difference in the level of taxpayer support required under the three models is not so large and perhaps does not exist. Considerable disagreement centers on this point. Some of the disagreement rests on which economic and financial variables to consider in the taxpayer cost equation; some disagreement rests on uncertainties and disputes surrounding true taxpayer costs in loan defaults.

Other themes in the 1997 book include an argument that regional accrediting bodies play an inconsistent and restrictive role in innovation and an overview of the integrated assessment, academic decision-support, and quality management system developed and implemented by Tucker.

===&quot;Rebel with a Cause&quot;===
In 2000, Sperling published an autobiography called &quot;Rebel with a Cause&quot;.

After reviewing Sperling&#x27;s autobiography Alex Lightman wrote, &quot;Sperling&#x27;s unflinching honesty in recounting his childhood of poverty and illiteracy in the Ozarks; his battles over academic accreditation and &#x27;the war on drugs;&#x27; his investments in cloning, anti-aging, and in crops that can grow amidst salt and sand; and, especially, his founding of a big, profitable public university that will probably generate more MBA holders than any other, all add up to a CEO whose life will echo, even thunder, for decades to come.&quot; Lightman also wrote, &quot;Las Vegas bookies probably would have given Sperling 100-to-1 odds against his business, but he not only survived, he grew the Apollo Group--parent of University of Phoenix and related interests--into a public company with a market capitalization (as of May 2001) of almost $7 billion, making it roughly as successful as many vastly more publicized dot-com champions.&quot; Expressing his final opinion of the book Lightman wrote, &quot;A book Like &quot;Rebel with a Cause&quot; is dangerous, because it sets new CEO standards for both searing self-reflection and for what constitutes success.&quot;

===&quot;The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America&quot;===
In August 2004, he co-authored &quot;The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America,&quot; released by his newly created publishing firm, PoliPoint Press. It was a sociological treatise attempting to explain the Red America/Blue America cultural and political divisions of the United States.

Despite a $2 million advertising campaign, the book was not widely embraced by its intended progressive audience. Thomas Frank, author of &quot;What&#x27;s The Matter With Kansas?&quot;, ridiculed Sperling&#x27;s view of American society: 

The book, however, did succeed in causing controversy in conservative media. Gary Gregg of &quot;National Review Online&quot; called the book the work of a &quot;metropolitan elite who disdain the cultures and values of middle America.&quot; R. Albert Mohler, Jr., president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, called it a work of &quot;hate, cultural condescension, and bizarre proposals backed up with hare-brained analysis.&quot;

The Great Divide is a blueprint for the Democratic Party to control the presidency and both houses of congress. Sperling and his co-authors claim that the United States has seldom been truly united and that there currently exists such a wide gap that the country is effectively two nations: &quot;one traditional and rooted in the past, and one modern and focused on the future.&quot; Sperling and his co-authors say these two nations are divided along racial, ethnic, religious, cultural, political, and geographic lines. They claim that political conflict in American is not really about left-wing or right-wing ideology but about the differences between what they call Metro America and Retro America; Metro America consists of the two coasts and the Great Lakes states. The authors argue that neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are national parties, so there is no point in behaving as such. They recommend that the Democrats concede the Retro states and focus entirely on the Metro states. This would allow the party to develop a coherent message that would connect with voters and to take advantage of the fact that Metro states account for 65 percent of the population. Then, once a strong base is built, the Democrats can work on unifying America.

<doc id="456484" wikidata="Q2479905" url="?curid=456484" title="James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury">
<text>James Brownlow William Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury, (born James Brownlow William Cecil, 17 April 1791 – 12 April 1868), styled Viscount Cranborne from birth until 1823, was a British Conservative politician. He held office under the Earl of Derby as Lord Privy Seal in 1852 and Lord President of the Council between 1858 and 1859. He was the father of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, three times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and grandfather of Arthur Balfour, who also served as Prime Minister.

==Background==
Salisbury was the son of James Cecil, 1st Marquess of Salisbury, and Lady Emily Mary Hill, daughter of Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire.

==Political career==
Salisbury entered the House of Commons in 1813 as Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, a seat he held until 1817, and then sat for Hertford between 1817 and 1823.

In the latter year, he succeeded his father in the marquessate and entered the House of Lords. He served in the Lord Derby&#x27;s first two cabinets as Lord Privy Seal in 1852 and as Lord President of the Council between 1858 and 1859. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1826 and made a Knight of the Garter in 1842.

Apart from his political career he also served as titular Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex between 1841 and 1868, and followed his father as colonel of the Hertfordshire Militia. During a period of unrest in 1830 he raised the South Hertfordshire Yeomanry Cavalry and commanded it with the rank of major. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel the following year when the regiment was expanded. In 1847, however, he exchanged with his second-in-command, James Grimston, 2nd Earl of Verulam, and reverted to the rank of major.

==Family==
Lord Salisbury was married twice. His first marriage was on 2 February 1821 to Frances Mary Gascoyne (born 25 January 1802, died 15 October 1839), daughter of Bamber Gascoyne of Childwall Hall, Lancashire, and his wife Sarah Bridget Frances Price. A biography of her by Carola Oman appeared in 1966. Upon marrying Frances, he added her surname to his own; subsequent Marquesses of Salisbury have therefore all borne the surname Gascoyne-Cecil. The couple had six children, including:
*James Emilius William Evelyn Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne (29 October 1821 – 14 June 1865), died unmarried.
*Lady Mildred Arabella Charlotte Gascoyne-Cecil (21 October 1822 – 18 March 1881), married Alexander Beresford Hope and had children.
*Lord Arthur Gascoyne-Cecil (19 December 1823 – 25 April 1825), died in infancy.
*Lady Blanche Mary Harriet (5 March 1825 – 16 May 1872), married James Maitland Balfour; mother of Prime Minister Arthur Balfour.
*Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury (3 February 1830 – 22 August 1903), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times between 1885 and 1902, married Georgina Alderson and had children.
*Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Eustace Brownlow Henry Gascoyne-Cecil (24 April 1834 – 3 July 1921), married Lady Gertrude Louisa Scott and had children.

Lord Salisbury&#x27;s second marriage, on 29 April 1847, was to Lady Mary Catherine Sackville-West, daughter of George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr, and Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr, with whom he had five children: 
*Lord Sackville Arthur Cecil (16 March 1848 – 29 January 1898), died unmarried.

<text>Warburg (; Westphalian: &quot;Warberich&quot; or &quot;Warborg&quot;) is a town in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia, central Germany on the river Diemel near the three-state point shared by Hessen, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. It is in Höxter district and Detmold region. Warburg is the midpoint in the &quot;Warburger Börde&quot;. Since March 2012 the city is allowed to call itself &#x27;Hanseatic City of Warburg&#x27;.

== Geography ==

The main town, consisting of the Old Town (&quot;Altstadt&quot;) and the New Town (&quot;Neustadt&quot;) and bearing the same name as the whole town, is a hill town. While the Old Town lies in the Diemel Valley, the New Town rises on the heights above the Diemel. The Warburg municipal area borders in the west on the Sauerland and in the northwest on the Eggegebirge foothills, while in the north and northeast the &quot;Warburger Börde&quot; abuts the town and in the south stretches the Diemel Valley.

=== Constituent communities ===
Warburg consists of the following 16 centres:
* Bonenburg (1,107 inhabitants)
* Calenberg (459 inhabitants)
* Dalheim (95 inhabitants)
* Daseburg (1,354 inhabitants)
* Dössel (651 inhabitants)
* Germete (997 inhabitants)
* Herlinghausen (446 inhabitants)
* Hohenwepel (683 inhabitants)
* Menne (846 inhabitants)
* Nörde (780 inhabitants)
* Ossendorf (1,332 inhabitants)
* Rimbeck (1,603 inhabitants)
* Scherfede (3,105 inhabitants)
* Warburg (10,663 inhabitants)
* Welda (889 inhabitants)
* Wormeln (652 inhabitants)

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
In the 4th millennium BC, there was a megalith culture in the Warburg area.

=== Protohistory ===
In the 1st century AD, there were Germanic settlers south of the Desenberg.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the 8th century, there was a Saxon noble seat west of the town. In the 8th and 9th centuries came the Christianization of the Saxons in the Diemel area.

The name Warburg was first mentioned in a document sometime around 1010, although archaeological finds have established that there were already people living in what is now Warburg by protohistoric times. The first definite documentary mention came in 1036.

In the 11th century there was on the &quot;Warburger Burgberg&quot; (&quot;Castle Mountain&quot;) the &quot;Wartburg&quot;, under whose protection people came and settled. The castle was at first owned by Count Dodiko, whose estate, according to documents, passed in 1020 to the Bishop of Paderborn when the Count&#x27;s only son met his end in an accident. Eventually, sometime between 1021 and 1033, the Emperor further granted to the bishop the Count&#x27;s rights. About 1180, the Old Town was granted town rights.

From the castle hill, there was a good view over the Diemel Valley, such that a close watch could be kept on the ford that merchants had to cross going to Warburg and Paderborn. This ford on the Diemel was a crossroads of several ancient commercial roads and was crucial in the town&#x27;s development into a central place. The Warburg New Town was founded in 1228–29 by Bernhard IV. zur Lippe, Bishop of Paderborn, to bolster his political position in the Diemel area against encroachment by the Bishop of Cologne. About 1239, the New Town had been built into a complete town in its own right, and the townsfolk there had full civil rights after the Dortmund and Marsberg models. In 1260, the New Town was granted the right to build a town wall, not only against armies from afar, but even – expressly – against the Old Town.

In 1364, both the Old Town and the New Town became members of the Hanseatic League. By 1436, they had forgotten their differences, uniting that year into one town.

==== Unification of the two towns ====

The two towns, the Old Town and the New Town, joined in 1436 into one town. In &quot;Der Grote Breff&quot; (&quot;The Great Letter&quot;), the newly united town&#x27;s constitution was precisely framed and sealed. Both former towns&#x27; seals are to be seen on the Great Letter. On the cast seal (in the picture), two defensive towers with a double wall are to be seen. Under the town gate stands the Bishop of Paderborn with a staff. The circumscription reads: &quot;Sigillium burgensium in wartborch&quot;. The Great Letter is written in Middle Low German, the Hanseatic League&#x27;s language, and stands as a substantial legal document.

Hitherto, the Old Town&#x27;s and the New Town&#x27;s council meetings had each been taking place in their respective town halls, each on their respective marketplaces. Now, however, there were two mayors. This was solved by allowing each mayor to head the unified town for half the year. Furthermore, both town halls were used for council meetings, again, each for half the year. However, the problem of having two town halls was not fully resolved until 132 years after the two former towns had merged. Only then, in 1568, was the new &quot;Rathaus Zwischen den Städten&quot; – Town Hall Between the Towns – built.

The common Town Hall, in the form of preserved Renaissance buildings, was built right on the former boundary between the two former towns, with two separate entrances for &quot;Altstädter&quot; and &quot;Neustädter&quot; (&quot;Old Towners&quot; and &quot;New Towners&quot;). In 1902–03, it was expanded with a half-timbered floor. It stands right where a gate, the &quot;Liebfrauentor&quot; (roughly, &quot;Gate of Our Lady&quot;), once stood. In the Middle Ages, this was the only gateway between the two then separate towns.

The Old Town&#x27;s former Town Hall, renovated in 1973, nowadays serves gastronomical and residential ends. The New Town&#x27;s former Town Hall served various purposes ranging from Town Hall cellar to assembly hall to market hall before it had to be torn down in 1803 owing to decrepitude.

There arose yet another superfluous government building in 1975 after the communities of the old &quot;Amt&quot; of Warburg-Land were amalgamated with Warburg, namely the &quot;Amt&quot; administration building on Kasseler Straße, which was forsaken by the district authorities in favour of the &quot;Behördenhaus&quot; (&quot;Authority House&quot;) on Bahnhofstraße.

=== Modern times ===

In the early 17th century, Warburg was a well known and rich trading town. Outside the town walls rose &quot;die Hüffert&quot; as a new part of the town. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War, great parts of die Hüffert and other villages in the area were sacked and destroyed, impoverishing the town. In 1622, the town was captured by Christian the Younger of Brunswick, Bishop of Halberstadt, who is sometimes called in German &quot;der tolle Christian&quot; – &quot;Christian the Mad&quot;. By 1628, the town was changing overlords and occupation armies repeatedly as the war dragged on, ending up in Imperial hands by the time the war ended in 1648.

On 5 June 1695, Johann Conrad Schlaun was born in Nörde near Warburg (now one of Warburg&#x27;s constituent communities).
On 31 July 1760, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, Warburg was the scene of a battle that now bears its name. Twenty-four thousand Prussian, Hanoverian, Hessian and British troops fought under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick and the Crown Prince of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) against a French army of 21,500 soldiers led by Lieutenant-General Le Chevalier du Muy and the Duke of Broglie. The Prussians and their allies won, killing 8,000 French soldiers while losing only 1,500 themselves, leaving them free to sack the town. A tower on the Desenberg recalls the Battle of Warburg.

On 3 August 1802, Prussian troops came into Warburg in anticipation of the decisions of German Mediatisation (&quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot;). From 1807 to 1813, in the Napoleonic Era, Warburg belonged to the Kingdom of Westphalia. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Warburg was once again assigned to Prussia. The next year, it became a district seat.

In 1850, the railway from Hamm was opened. In 1892 – 244 years after it had ended – Warburg at last paid off the last of the debts that it had incurred because of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

In 1933, at the March elections, the Centre Party won 67.2% of the vote in Warburg to the NSDAP&#x27;s 21.8%.

During World War II there was a Prisoner of war camp Oflag VI-B in the suburb Dössel. 20 September 1943, 47 Polish officers escaped through a tunnel. 37 were recaptured and executed by the Gestapo.

On 1 April 1945, Warburg was captured by American troops.

On 1 January 1975 came municipal reorganization, which saw 16 formerly independent municipalities merged into a new greater town of Warburg. Also, the districts of Warburg and Höxter were united, taking the latter&#x27;s name. In 1983, Warburg became a founding member of the Wesphalian Hanseatic League (&quot;Westfälischer Hansebund&quot;).

=== History of the districts ===

==== Welda ====
The lands around Warburg&#x27;s constituent community of Welda, once a border town between Westphalia, Waldeck and Hesse, have yielded forth archaeological evidence of a Celtic presence. It has been confirmed that the village was once visited in 1856 by Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who went on to become the &quot;Ninety-Nine-Day Emperor&quot;, Kaiser Friedrich III. He presented the church with a Communion chalice. After the Second World War, in 1945, there was an American prison camp at Welda holding roughly 80,000 German prisoners of war.

==== Wormeln ====
Likewise, Wormeln&#x27;s surrounding area has yielded archaeological finds that point to ancient settlement.

There is believed to have been a parish in Wormeln by about 780, with church patrons Simon the Zealot and Judah. Wormeln had its first documentary mention in 1018 in a donation document from Count Dodiko to Meinwerk, Bishop of Paderborn.

About 1246, the Counts of Everstein founded the Wormeln Cistercian Convent of the &quot;Nuns of the Grey Order&quot; Cistercians. On 16 September 1810, Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia in Napoleonic times, decreed the convent&#x27;s dissolution.

*2020 – 22.928

=== Religion ===

==== Christianity ====

During the Saxon Wars in the 8th century the area round the Diemel was incorporated into the Frankish realm. Beside other places Warburg is presumed to be the location were the Irminsul, an old Saxon sacred pillar. The Austrian abbot Sturmius proselytized the area around the Diemel and Weser in 774. So the area around Warburg was Christianized from 774 on.

===== Catholic church =====
As most of Warburg&#x27;s inhabitants are Catholic it is part of the center zone of the Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn. Many theologians as Otto Beckmann, Anton Corvinus or Julius Dammann, office bearers of the church like Johann Conrad Schlaun or Arnold Güldenpfennig and church artists like Josef Kohlschein come from Warburg.

===== Syriac Orthodox =====

The Syriac Orthodox Church&#x27;s bishopric of Germany was founded in 1997 and has its Episcopal seat in the former Dominican monastery in Warburg. After the monastery was renovated, it is now used as the Syriac Orthodox Monastery of Mor Yacqub of Sarugh, and as a centre for the community in Westphalia. The Body of Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas is buried here.

==== Jewish life in Warburg ====

Warburg had in bygone days an important Jewish community. Around the year 1800, roughly 200 of Warburg&#x27;s 2,000 townsfolk were Jewish, and about 1900, some 300 of the 5,000 people in the town were. The sharp upswing in the population as a whole was due to migration from the countryside, industries setting up shop in town, and railway operations.

In the 16th century, the Warburg family - originally from Venice de la Banca, Abraham de Palenzuela Levi Kahana- took the town&#x27;s name as their own and moved in the second half of the 18th century to Altona (Hamburg), where the brothers Moses Marcus and Gerson Warburg built up the Bankinstitut M&amp;M Warburg in 1798. From this family also came the natural scientists Otto and Emil Warburg the art historian and cultural theorist Abraham Moritz Warburg, better known as Aby Warburg, who founded the Warburg Institute.

Another well known Warburg Jewish family were the Oppenheims, among whom was Hermann Oppenheim, a famous German neurologist. Yet another famous townsman was Emil Herz, a publisher at the Ullstein-Verlag (until the Nazis forced him out as the company&#x27;s director in 1934, after he had worked there for 30 years), who described in his book something of Jewish life in Warburg.

There is still a Jewish cemetery in Warburg today. The synagogue, which stood in the Old Town, was destroyed on &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (9 November 1938).

==== Medieval fortification ====

In the Middle Ages, the castle was mostly surrounded by a double wall ring, through which the old and new city gates lead to the breachstone. The old town&#x27;s citizens first erected the connection wall of the castle to the &quot;Johannistor-Tower&quot;. Because of height of the castle mountain the &quot;Chattenturm&quot; was constructed. The round &quot;Sackturm&quot; (Saxon tower) next to the &quot;Sacktor&quot; (Saxon Gate) was erected in 1443 while the &quot;Sacktor&quot; was built around 1300. Until 1830, the town castle had about ten city towers and nine city gates. In the walls of the old town, there were five gates and four in the new town, of which only the &quot;Sacktor&quot; and the &quot;Johannistor&quot; have been preserved. Between 1801 and 1840, the other gates were taken down.

=== Coat of arms ===
Warburg&#x27;s civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: In azure a fleur-de-lis argent.

Warburg&#x27;s oldest town seals are from 1254 and 1257, and show a bishop – likely the Bishop of Paderborn – standing in a gateway. The fleur-de-lis charge seen in today&#x27;s arms originally appeared on coins minted in the town, beginning in 1227. Smaller town seals in the 14th century also showed the lis, with the gateway only appearing on the greater seal.

For a time in the 20th century, Warburg used a coat of arms based on the old greater seal, showing the walls, towers and gateway, but not the bishop. His place was taken by a fleur-de-lis. The town, however, readopted the fleur-de-lis-only composition on 30 June 1977.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
At Warburg, Federal Highways (&quot;Bundesstraßen&quot;) B 7 and B 252 cross. On the latter, one may reach the Warburg interchange on Autobahn A 44 (Kassel-Dortmund), which not much farther on meets the A 7 near Kassel and the A 33 near Wuennenberg.

Warburg station lies on the Ruhr area-Kassel (InterCityExpress, InterCity and RegionalBahn trains) and Hagen-Warburg regional lines: RE17 Hagen – Schwerte – Brilon-Wald – Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe and RB89 Rheine – Münster – Hamm – Paderborn – Warburg (Westfalen-Bahn). Furthermore, the Regio Citadis &quot;tram-train&quot; runs to Kassel Main Railway Station (Kassel Hauptbahnhof). The surrounding towns are served by regional buses. The town belongs to the Paderborn-Höxter Local Transport Association (&quot;Nahverkehrsverbund Paderborn-Höxter&quot;). When travelling towards Hesse, the North Hesse Transport Association (&quot;Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund&quot; or NVV) tariffs apply.

Also easily reached are the two regional airports, Kassel-Calden and Paderborn-Lippstadt.

=== Fire brigade ===
The town of Warburg already had at its disposal in the Middle Ages organized fire-quenching forces from among the citizenry. With the &quot;Prussian Fire Order&quot; in the early 19th century, even the outlying communities were obliged to lay the groundwork for firefighting.

Beginning about 1850 in what is today Warburg&#x27;s municipal area, the first structures of modern fire brigades were taking shape as &quot;dousing and spraying teams&quot;. These were the beginnings of the Ossendorf and Scherfede fire brigades.

After the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), it was veterans who had the idea of setting up volunteer fire brigades after the French example of the &quot;pompiers&quot;. Thus arose the Wormeln fire brigade.

In the main town of Warburg, the volunteer fire brigade was founded in 1889, and quickly thereafter, the same happened in communities throughout the &quot;Warburger Land&quot;. After the fire in Hohenwepel in 1912, they were established in Dössel, Hohenwepel and Menne.

Today&#x27;s Warburg volunteer fire brigade was founded in 1975 by merging the town&#x27;s and all newly amalgamated centres&#x27; former volunteer fire brigades.

<text>The Church of All Nations (; ), also known as the Church of Gethsemane or the Basilica of the Agony (), is a Catholic church located on the Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem, next to the Garden of Gethsemane. It enshrines a section of bedrock where Jesus is said to have prayed before his arrest. ()

The reasons for its construction in the 1920s were complex, with some political factors.

==History==
The current church rests on the foundations of two earlier ones, that of a 4th-century Byzantine basilica, destroyed by an earthquake in 746, and of a small 12th-century Crusader chapel abandoned in 1345. In 1920, during work on the foundations, a column was found beneath the floor of the medieval crusader chapel. Fragments of a magnificent mosaic were also found. Following this discovery, the architect immediately removed the new foundations and began excavations of the earlier church. After the remains of the Byzantine-era church were fully excavated, plans for the new church were altered and work continued on the current basilica from April 19, 1922, until June 1924 when it was consecrated.

An arson attack took place on the church in December 2020, without much damage having been caused. The Custody of the Holy Land, the official custodian of Catholic holy sites in Israel and Palestine, condemned the arson attack on the church, which is a Christian holy site.

In December 2020, archaeologists revealed the remains of the foundations of a Second Temple-era ritual bath (also known as a mikveh) during construction work on a modern tunnel under the Church of All Nations and a 1,500-year-old Byzantine church. According to Dr. Leah and Dr. Rosario, Greek inscriptions were written on the church&#x27;s floor as : &quot;for the memory and repose of those who love Christ… accept the offering of your servants and give them remission of sins”. According to Israel Antiquities Authority&#x27;s Jerusalem district head Amit Re’em, the bath is notable, based on the archaeological evidence, as a later Christian pilgrimage site that was in fact used in the days of Jesus.

== Use by other denominations ==
An open altar located in the gardens of the church is used by many Christian denominations including followers who are Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Protestant, Lutheran, Evangelical, Anglican, and any other version of Christianity that is culturally unique to any particular nation.

== Design and construction ==

The church was built between 1919 and 1924 using funds donated from many different countries. The coat-of-arms of twelve of the countries from which donations originated are incorporated into the ceiling, each in a separate, small dome, and also into the interior mosaics. The countries honored in this way are, east to west (altar to entrance) and beginning with the northern apse: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico; in the middle of the church are commemorated: Italy, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, and to the right: Belgium, Canada, Germany, and the United States of America. The mosaics in the apses were donated by Ireland, Hungary, and Poland (by the sculpturist Tadeusz Adam Zieliński). The crown around the bedrock itself was a gift of Australia. These multi-national donations give the church one of its present names as the &quot;Church of All Nations&quot;.

Two types of stone were used in the construction of the church: the interior utilizes a stone from the quarries at Lifta, north-west of Jerusalem; and the exterior, a rose colored stone from Bethlehem. The building is divided by six columns into three aisles, but with an even ceiling lacking a clerestory. This design gives the impression of one large open hall. Alabaster panels dyed violet were used for the windows to evoke a mood of depression analogous to Christ&#x27;s agony, and the ceiling is painted a deep blue to simulate a night sky.

The facade of the church is supported by a row of Corinthian columns. Atop each column sits statues of the Four Evangelists. First is Mark. Second, Luke holds a quote from Luke 22:43–44 “…factus in agonia prolixius orabat et factus est sudor eius sicut guttae sanguinis decurrentis in terram&quot; or translated from the Vulgate, &quot;And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.&quot; Followed by Matthew holding Matthew 26:42b
&quot;Pater mi, si non potest hic calix transire nisi bibam illum, fiat voluntas tua&quot; or translated “My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.” The final statue is of John. The columns and statues are set below a modern mosaic depicting Jesus Christ as mediator between God and man. The designer of the facade mosaic was Professor Giulio Bargellini.

The bubble-domed roof, thick columns, and facade mosaic, give the church a Neoclassical look.

The church was designed by Italian architect Antonio Barluzzi and is currently held in trust by the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land.

<doc id="456494" wikidata="Q1950882" url="?curid=456494" title="Riddle Box">
<text>Riddle Box is the third studio album by the American hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse, released in 1995 on Battery Records and Island Records in association with Psychopathic Records. It is the third Joker&#x27;s Card in the group&#x27;s Dark Carnival mythology. It was released a second time by Battery Records and Jive Records. In 2008 it was re-released on a Riddle Box vinyl record. The album was the first Insane Clown Posse album in which the group worked with studio vocalist and guitarist Rich Murrell, who would work with the group throughout much of their career under the name Legz Diamond. It was released in four different versions, and earned a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2008, &quot;Riddle Box&quot; was re-released on vinyl double LP format. In 2015, Psychopathic Records reissued the album in a 20th anniversary edition, featuring bonus tracks.

==Conception==
===Background===
In 1995, Insane Clown Posse signed a contract with the short-lived Jive Records subsidiary label Battery Records. Anticipating the album to be their first national release, the duo began work on &quot;Riddle Box&quot;. Member Joseph Bruce recalled thinking that working on the album would be &quot;all the records we had done … rolled into one single effort.&quot;

===Recording===
Recording for &quot;Riddle Box&quot; occurred in producer Mike E. Clark’s personal studio. The group was looking to make the album more theatrical, so Clark introduced them to local guitarist and vocalist Rich Murrell. Originally a member of the group Coup Detroit, Murrell later left his band to join Insane Clown Posse’s studio band along with Clark. Murrell contributed to the album through guitar and various vocals in songs and skits.

Jive Records&#x27; Senior Vice President of Artists and repertoire, Jeff Fenster, had told Insane Clown Posse that &quot;Riddle Box&quot; couldn’t be over one hour long. When the group turned in the album at 70 minutes and 40 seconds long, Fenster was furious. Joseph Bruce told Fenster that the album featured several skits, and convinced him that the length was not an issue.

===Joker&#x27;s Cards===
&quot;Riddle Box&quot; is the third Joker&#x27;s Card in Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s Dark Carnival concept album series. The Dark Carnival is a concept of the afterlife in which souls are sent to a form of limbo while waiting to be sent to heaven or hell based on their individual actions. These concepts are related by Insane Clown Posse in a series of albums called the six Joker&#x27;s Cards. Each of the six Joker&#x27;s Cards relate to a specific character — an entity of the Dark Carnival — that tries to &quot;save the human soul&quot; by showing the wicked inside of one&#x27;s self.

&quot;Riddle Box&quot; is one of several entities used to determine the fate of the dead. Upon death, a soul enters a dark chamber containing a jack-in-the-box on an old wooden table. The front of the box has a &quot;painted question mark faded with time,&quot; representing the mystery of your own afterlife. As the handle is turned, a melodic tune begins to play, and when the music stops, the choice is made. The pure see a vision of God, warming their souls as they enter eternal peace. The wicked see an immense fog seeping from the box, &quot;stripping their sanity, as they witness an image of hell, spawned and formed from their own evil; a hideous reflection of their demented souls.&quot; The floor falls from underneath them, casting the doomed into the bottomless pit of Hell.

==Music==
&quot;Chicken Huntin&#x27;&quot;, which was remixed for &quot;Riddle Box&quot;, was previously released on Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Ringmaster&quot;. &quot;Dead Body Man&quot; was previously released in 1994, on the group&#x27;s second EP &quot;The Terror Wheel&quot;, in a slightly lower key. Finally, &quot;3 Rings&quot; was previously released on Shaggy 2 Dope&#x27;s 1994 EP &quot;Fuck Off!&quot;, with the &quot;Riddle Box&quot; version featuring a slight change in lyrics.

===Samples===
&quot;I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot; contains a sample from &quot;Confetti Day&quot; by Hot Chocolate. &quot;Cemetery Girl&quot; contains a sample from the &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; song &quot;Guts on the Ceiling&quot;. &quot;Toy Box&quot; samples Gong&#x27;s &quot;The Pot Head Pixies&quot; and the &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; theme song.

===Lyricism===
The eponymous Riddle Box is a jack-in-the-box that decides whether one&#x27;s soul is sent to Shangri-La or Hell&#x27;s Pit in the afterlife. The album&#x27;s themes revolve around death and judgement, and reveal that the fate determined by the Riddle Box can be found by looking deep within yourself, and can be changed with righteous actions. 
In &quot;Chicken Huntin&#x27;,&quot; the group raps about killing multiple racist rednecks, referred to as &#x27;Chickens&#x27;. The song &quot;3 Rings&quot; speaks against social excommunication. &quot;Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; is a gameshow in Hell where a police officer, a judge, and a redneck are all sentenced to be tortured. The song &quot;12&quot; tells of a misplaced execution in which the person killed takes vengeance on 12 jurors who were involved in sentencing him to death. The second to last song on the album, &quot;The Killing Fields,&quot; tells of a part of Hell where the wicked are perpetually tortured.

The album also makes several references to American popular culture. The title of the song &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; is inspired by the quiz show of the same name. &quot;Ol&#x27; Evil Eye&quot; is loosely based around Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s famous short story &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; and features excerpts from the story being read. Poe was given credit for the track&#x27;s lyrics.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Riddle Box&quot; was released in four different versions. One version was the standard pressing, a second contained a bonus track of snippets from four Hed PE songs, a third featured reversed colors on the disc, and a fourth was a remastered version. Battery/Jive Records showed little interest in promoting the album, and only released it limitedly nationwide. Insane Clown Posse then funded its own promotion of &quot;Riddle Box&quot; independently in Dallas, Texas, where it persuaded several music retail stores to stock the album. Sales averaged 1,500 copies per week as a result.

==Critical reception==
Jason Anderson from Allmusic stated that &quot;Perhaps ICP&#x27;s more dynamic delivery and second-rate Cypress Hill aesthetic elevates Riddle Box just above its predecessors, but all of the group&#x27;s musical work is so far below any reasonable rap/rock standard that it hardly matters.&quot; and picked &quot;Chicken Huntin&#x27; (Slaughter House Mix)&quot;, &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; and &quot;Ol&#x27; Evil Eye&quot; the best tracks of the album.

==Legacy==

A music video for &quot;Chicken Huntin&#x27; (Slaughter House Mix)&quot; was shot at the State Theatre (now called the Fillmore Theatre) during an actual Insane Clown Posse concert. The director of the video, Paris Mayhew, wanted Insane Clown Posse to perform the song several times in order to get the footage from all angles, but the duo refused to repeat the song because it was an actual ICP concert, and not just a video shoot. The video was shot with ICP performing the song only once. The original version of &quot;Chicken Huntin&#x27;&quot; was performed for the video shoot, because their fans were not yet familiar with the remix. This made Jive furious, but there were no editing problems, and Violent J later referred to the video as &quot;our freshest video ever.&quot;

Songs called &quot;Fat Sweaty Betty&quot; and &quot;Willy Bubba&quot; were originally intended for this album. Insane Clown Posse even released a single of &quot;Fat Sweaty Betty&quot;. They were cut from the album at the last minute, but remixed versions were later released on &quot;Forgotten Freshness&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Freshness 1 &amp; 2&quot;. In 2002, the track &quot;Riddle Box&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Solaris&quot;. According to Insane Clown Posse, the group has not received any financial compensation from the filmmakers. On December 16, 2008, &quot;Riddle Box&quot; was re-released on vinyl double LP format.

This album was responsible for expanding the Juggalo fanbase into its own culture, leading Insane Clown Posse to write the songs &quot;What Is A Juggalo?&quot; and &quot;Down With The Clown&quot; for their next album, &quot;The Great Milenko&quot;.

<doc id="456497" wikidata="Q4040549" url="?curid=456497" title="Hell's Pit">
<text>The Wraith: Hell&#x27;s Pit is the ninth studio album by the American hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse. It was released on August 31, 2004, via Psychopathic Records as a follow-up to 2002 &quot;The Wraith: Shangri-La&quot; and the second half of the sixth and final Joker Card in the first Deck of the Dark Carnival mythology. Recording sessions took place at the Lotus Pod in Detroit. Production was handled by ICP themselves.

The album peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the Independent Albums charts in the United States. It also made it to number 49 in the ARIA Top 100 Albums Chart, and peaked at number 25 on the Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart and at number 22 on the Independent Albums Chart in the UK music charts.

13 of its 17 original tracks were remixed and included in &quot;The Wraith: Remix Albums&quot; compilation album, which was released on November 14, 2006.

==History==
Following the release of 2002 &quot;The Wraith: Shangri-La&quot;, group member Violent J admitted that he was considering not completing the production of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot;. He is quoted as describing &quot;Shangri-La&quot; as &quot;the end of the road. It&#x27;s the end of the Joker&#x27;s Cards. After this I could do anything I want, for the rest of my life. The positivity was so unbelievable&quot;.

==Music==

===Production===
Preceding the release of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot;, Violent J stated the album&#x27;s sound was intended as a throwback to the minimalistic sound of &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot;, particularly its darker second half. He also stated that it would contain less rock elements and singing, and that it would not feature guest appearances. &quot;Bowling Balls&quot; samples the drum beat of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Justify My Love&quot;, which was based upon Public Enemy&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Security of the First World&quot;, which was in turn based on the end drum break of James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Funky Drummer&quot;.

===Lyrical themes===
&quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot; is the second part of the sixth Joker&#x27;s Card, &quot;The Wraith&quot;, written with the opposite intent of its counterpart, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot; is intended to illustrate the horrors of hell itself. Many of the songs feature Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope fictitiously dying, to be sent to Hell, depicted in the album as a place void of all hope and peace, where those who do not atone for their sins and follow the ways of Shangri-La will presumably be sent upon their death. Violent J described the album as &quot;Horror tale after Horror tale, mixed in with songs that describe hell&quot; and stated that it was the darkest, most painful work he had ever done.

==Release==
Two versions of the album were released, each containing a different DVD. One release featured a live concert and a twelve-minute music video for the song &quot;Real Underground Baby&quot;, and another featured a short 3D film for the song &quot;Bowling Balls&quot;, shot in high-definition video.

==Critical reception==

Of the album&#x27;s conclusion to the Dark Carnival storyline, AllMusic&#x27;s David Jeffries wrote that &quot;Insane Clown Posse sound tired of the concept, only getting inspired when they&#x27;ve moved on from it&quot;. Steve &#x27;Flash&#x27; Juon of RapReviews wrote that &quot;&quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot; may be named, if only because I felt like I was in a burning pit of Hell in my ears while listening to it. Actually, that might be preferable to ever playing this album again&quot;. Walker MacMurdo of &quot;Willamette Week&quot; stated: &quot;although the first half of the album bears a little too much of a resemblance to Korn&#x27;s disappointing output of the early 2000s, the consistency of the second half of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot; makes it one of ICP&#x27;s stronger offerings&quot;.

==&quot;Hell&#x27;s Cellar&quot;==

Hell&#x27;s Cellar an extended play by American hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse. It was released on July 19, 2018 at the Gathering of the Juggalos festival via Psychopathic Records. It is composed of nine outtakes from &quot;The Wraith: Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot; and has no verses from Shaggy 2 Dope.
In 2017, it was announced that Insane Clown Posse would perform &quot;The Wraith: Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot; album in its entirety at the 2018 Gathering of the Juggalos (happened July 18 – 20 at Legend Valley in Thornville, Ohio). On July 13, 2018, the duo announced that in preparation for the 2018 Gathering of the Juggalos, they had found nine &quot;lost Violent J recordings from the &quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot; recording sessions&quot; and would release them as an EP on the day of the Hell&#x27;s Pit show (July 19, 2018), and titled it &quot;Hell&#x27;s Cellar&quot;. During ICP&#x27;s seminar, they announced that they found 13 songs all together, but decided to release nine then and the rest on the 20th anniversary edition.

<doc id="456498" wikidata="Q19594981" url="?curid=456498" title="Soochow University (1900–1952)">
<text>The original Soochow University () was a university based in Suzhou and Shanghai in China, established in 1900. The university was registered in the state of Tennessee in the United States.

After the Chinese Civil War, the university was disbanded by the People&#x27;s Republic of China government in 1952, with its faculties amalgamated with parts of other universities to create various specialist universities in Suzhou and Shanghai. One of these specialist institutions, the Jiangsu Teacher&#x27;s College (also known as Jiangsu Normal School), took over the main Suzhou campus of the old Soochow University, and in 1982 adopted the English name Soochow University (a different Chinese name to the original institution was adopted).

A different university by the same name (both in English and Chinese) was set up by alumni in Taiwan in 1951.

==History==
The original Soochow University was founded by Methodist missionaries in Suzhou, Jiangsu, Qing dynasty in 1900 as a merger of three existing institutions: the Buffington Institute and the Kung Hang School in the city of Soochow (now spelled Suzhou), in Jiangsu Province, and the Anglo-Chinese College in Shanghai, which at the time was also part of Jiangsu Province. In 1901, the university registered in the state of Tennessee in the United States under the name Central University in China. Its first president was David Lawrence Anderson who was also the founder of the predecessor Kung Hang School.

The original Soochow University, like the university currently in Taiwan, was named &quot;Dōngwú Dàxué&quot; () in Chinese. &quot;Dongwu&quot; or &quot;East Wu&quot; refers to the Wu region, in which both Suzhou and Shanghai are located and of which Suzhou was historically the cultural and political centre.

Soochow University was especially well known for the quality of its law school, based in Shanghai.

After the Chinese Civil War, members of the Soochow Alumni Association who moved to Taiwan established a new institution in Taiwan in 1951 to make up for the Soochow University lost in mainland China. A law school was opened in 1954, and a full university was certified in 1971.

After the establishment of the PRC, the institution in Suzhou merged with the Southern Jiangsu College of Culture and Education and the Department of Mathematics and Physics at Jiangnan University to form the Jiangsu Teacher&#x27;s College in 1952, while the law school in Shanghai merged into the East China University of Politics and Law. The English name Soochow University was revived in 1982 by the Jiangsu Teacher’s College; however, the original Chinese name &quot;Dongwu&quot; 東吳 was not adopted, and the institution was given the name &quot;Suzhou&quot; 苏州. 

==Successor universities ==
From 1900 to 1952, Soochow University () operated in Suzhou and Shanghai
*Soochow University (Suzhou) (; 1982–present) - into which several of the original university&#x27;s faculties merged in 1952, and based at the original campus of Soochow University.
*East China University of Political Science and Law - into which the Soochow University Law School merged in 1952.
*Shanghai University of Finance and Economics - into which the Soochow University accounting faculty merged in 1952.
*Soochow University (Taiwan) (; operating in Taiwan 1952–present) - revival by alumni.
*Chung Chi College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong - founded in 1951 as a successor to 13 abolished Christian universities in mainland China, including Soochow University, later a founding college of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

<doc id="456499" wikidata="Q7246665" url="?curid=456499" title="ProLife Alliance">
<text>ProLife Alliance (PLA) or simply ProLife, was an anti-abortion, single-issue political party that was active in the United Kingdom from 1996 to 2004. Since that time it has continued as an advocacy group. 
It is opposed to any form of euthanasia and opposes human cloning, abortion and experiments on human embryos. It supports guaranteed maternity and paternity leave. Its leader is Dominica Roberts.

The Pro-Life Alliance was founded by two anti-abortion activists, Josephine Quintavalle and her son Bruno Quintavalle. They contested the 1997 general election, bringing about litigation against the BBC over the latter&#x27;s refusal to screen the PLA&#x27;s party political broadcast. The party contested 56 of the 659 constituencies and attracted a total of 19,332 votes. It gained over 1% of the vote in only five constituencies in England and Wales, although did slightly better in Scotland, where it averaged 1.5% of the vote and secured over 2% in three seats. Its vote share declined further in the 1999 Scottish Parliamentary elections, 2001 general election, and 2004 European Parliament election. It disbanded in 2004.

==History==
The Pro-Life Alliance was established as a political party in October 1996 by Josephine Quintavalle and her son Bruno Quintavalle. Its membership consisted a high percentage of Roman Catholics.

It contested 56 seats in the 1997 general election. In total, it attracted 19,332 votes, averaging of 345 votes per constituency. In England and Wales, the PLA gained over 1% of the vote in only five constituencies: Billericay, Leyton and Wanstead, Solihull, Manchester Withington, and Doncaster Central. In Scotland, it contested nine seats, all of them in the Greater Glasgow area. There, it averaged 1.5% of the vote and gained over 2% in three seats. That it did better in this part of Scotland rather than in England or Wales might reflect the greater proportion of Roman Catholics living in the Greater Glasgow area.

The refusal of the BBC to show its television party political broadcast led to litigation (&quot;R (ProLife Alliance) v BBC&quot;), in which it was ultimately unsuccessful.

The PLA contested the 1999 Scottish Parliamentary elections—the very first since the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament—but its vote was less than that of the 1997 general election. This was despite the fact that the Scottish Parliament election utilised a form of proportional representation which benefited minor parties, a contrast to the general election&#x27;s use of first-past-the-post voting. The sociologist Steve Bruce suggested that the decline in the Scottish vote may have been because voters were &quot;too excited&quot; by the restoration of their parliament after 292 years to &quot;be interested in apparently fringe issues&quot; such as abortion.

The PLA fielded 37 candidates at the 2001 general election. Its vote was lower than in 1997; it averaged 255 votes per seat, and 30 of its candidates polled less than 1%. 26 of its candidates came last in their respective constituencies.

In entering the 2004 European Parliament election, it had difficulty attracting candidates willing to stand, the result of which was that seven of the 22 standing for election in England contested more than one electoral region. The ProLife Alliance gained 20,393 votes in the 2004 European Parliament election, equating to 0.1% of votes cast. A few months later, in December 2004, the PLA disbanded as a political party and did not contest any seats in the 2005 general election. Much of the party&#x27;s support subsequently went to a minor Christian democratic party, the Christian Peoples Alliance (CPA), with many of the CPA&#x27;s electoral candidates having been former PLA candidates.

In 2003, the Department of Health significantly reduced the statistical information it provided about abortions for suspected foetal abnormalities. The ProLife Alliance challenged this under the Freedom of Information Act, and this challenge was supported by the Information Commissioner. An appeal by the Department of Health to the Information Tribunal failed. The Tribunal rejected the Department&#x27;s view that personal information would be unreasonably endangered, and commented on the Department&#x27;s duty to ensure compliance with the Abortion Act and its failure to scrutinise reporting forms &quot;either clinically or substantively&quot;. The Department first planned to appeal to the High Court, but subsequently conceded and made the requested information available in July 2011.

The sociologist Steve Bruce was of the view that the Pro-Life Alliance&#x27;s inability to achieve political success reflected the &quot;relative unpopularity of abortion as an election issue&quot; in the United Kingdom. In his view, its &quot;failure&quot; at the ballot box demonstrated &quot;a failure to win the argument&quot;, with the majority of the British population believing that abortion should remain legal. A 2005 poll found that over 70% of Britons believed that abortion should be always or mostly legal while less than a quarter thought that it should be always or mostly illegal.

<text>The Baptist Church of Hungary () is a Baptist Christian denomination in Hungary. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Budapest.

==History==

The Baptist Church of Hungary has its origins in the first Baptist church in Budapest founded by the German missionary Heinrich Meyer of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1874. In 1900, the Baptist Union of Hungary was founded. In 1920, a group of churches broke away from the Baptist Union of Hungary to form the Baptist Church of Hungary. According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 290 churches and 11,208 members.

<doc id="456506" wikidata="Q1021436" url="?curid=456506" title="Lapita culture">
<text>The Lapita culture is the name given to a Neolithic Austronesian people and their distinct material culture, who settled Island Melanesia via a seaborne migration at around 1600 to 500 BCE. The Lapita people are believed to have originated from the northern Philippines, either directly, via the Mariana Islands, or both. They were notable for their distinctive geometric designs on dentate-stamped pottery, which closely resemble the pottery recovered from the Nagsabaran archaeological site in northern Luzon. The Lapita intermarried with the Papuan populations to various degrees, and are the direct ancestors of the Austronesian peoples of Polynesia, eastern Micronesia, and Island Melanesia.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Lapita&quot; was coined by archaeologists after mishearing a word in the local Haveke language, &quot;xapeta&#x27;a&quot;, which means &quot;to dig a hole&quot; or &quot;the place where one digs&quot;, during the 1952 excavation in New Caledonia. The Lapita archaeological culture is named after the type site where it was first uncovered in the Foué peninsula on Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. The excavation was carried out in 1952 by American archaeologists Edward W. Gifford and Richard Shutler Jr. at &#x27;Site 13&#x27;. The settlement and pottery sherds were later dated to 800 BCE and proved significant in research on the early peopling of the Pacific Islands. More than 200 Lapita sites have since been uncovered, ranging more than 4,000 km from coastal and island Melanesia to Fiji and Tonga with its most eastern limit so far in Samoa.

The term &quot;Lapita&quot; is now used to refer to the collection of theories regarding the origin and features of the ancestors of the people that speak the Oceanic languages. It also refers to the material culture found in excavations, especially pottery, related to these ancestral communities.

==Artifact dating==
&#x27;Classic&#x27; Lapita pottery was produced between 1,600 and 1,200 BCE on the Bismarck Archipelago. Artifacts exhibiting Lapita designs and techniques from a period later than 1,200 BCE have been found in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Lapita pottery styles from around 1,000 BCE have been found in Fiji and Western Polynesia.

In Western Polynesia, Lapita pottery became less decorative and progressively simpler over time. It seems to have stopped being produced altogether in Samoa by about 2,800 years ago, and in Tonga by about 2,000 years ago.

==Material culture==
Pottery whose detailed decorative designs suggest Lapita influence was made from a variety of materials, depending on what was available, and their crafters used a variety of techniques, depending on the tools they had. But, typically, the pottery consisted of low-fired earthenware, tempered with shells or sand, and decorated using a toothed (&quot;dentate&quot;) stamp. It has been theorized that these decorations may have been transferred from less hardy material, such as bark cloth (&quot;tapa&quot;) or mats, or from tattoos, onto the pottery – or transferred from the pottery onto those materials. Other important parts of the Lapita repertoire were: undecorated (&quot;plain-ware&quot;) pottery, including beakers, cooking pots, and bowls; shell artifacts; ground-stone adzes; and flaked-stone tools made of obsidian, chert, or other available kinds of rock.

==Economy==

The Lapita kept pigs, dogs, and chickens. Horticulture was based on root crops and tree crops, most importantly taro, yam, coconuts, bananas, and varieties of breadfruit. These foods were likely supplemented by fishing and mollusc gathering.
Long-distance trade was practiced; items traded included obsidian, adzes, adze source-rock, and shells.

==Burial customs==
In 2003, at the Teouma archeological excavation site on Efate Island in Vanuatu, a large cemetery was discovered, including 25 graves containing burial jars and a total of 36 human skeletons. All the skeletons were headless: At some point after the bodies had originally been buried, the skulls had been removed and replaced with rings made from cone shells, and the heads had been reburied. One grave contained the skeleton of an elderly man with three skulls sitting on his chest. Another grave contained a burial jar depicting four birds looking into the jar. Carbon dating of the shells placed this cemetery as having been in use around 1000 BCE.

==Settlements==
Lapita culture villages on islands in the area of Remote Oceania tended not to be located inland, but instead on the beach, or on small offshore islets. These locations may have been chosen because inland areas – for example in New Guinea – were already settled by other peoples. Or they may have been chosen in order to avoid areas inhabited by mosquitoes carrying malaria, against which Lapita people likely had no immune defense. Some of their houses were built on stilts over large lagoons. In New Britain, however, there were inland settlements; they were located near obsidian sources. And on the islands at the eastern end of the archipelago, all settlements were located inland rather than on the beaches – sometimes fairly far inland.

==Distribution==
The &quot;Lapita complex&quot; encompasses a very large geographic region from Mussay to Samoa. Lapita pottery has been found in Near Oceania as well as Remote Oceania, as far west as the Bismarck Archipelago, as far east as Samoa, and as far south as New Caledonia. Excavation at a site in the village of Mulifanua in Samoa uncovered two adzes that strongly indicate Lapita influence. Carbon dating of material found with the adzes suggests there was a Lapita settlement at this site in roughly 1000 BCE. Radio carbon dating of sites in New Caledonia suggest there were Lapita settlements there as early as 1,110 years ago. The dates and locations of more northerly Lapita-influenced settlements are still largely up for debate.

The &quot;Lapita complex&quot; has been divided into three geographical subregions or provincesː the Far Western Lapita, the Western Lapita, and the Eastern Lapita. Within the Far Western Lapita is the New Britain or Bismarck archipelago, including the area discovered by Otto Meyer in 1909. The Western Lapita includes the artifacts found within the Solomon Islands to New Caledonia. The Eastern Lapita is attributed to the Fiji, Tonga and Samoa region. Discoveries of unique patterns within the Eastern Lapita region suggest a subdivision of Early and Late Eastern Lapita variations.

==Language==
Linguists and other researchers theorize that the people of the Lapita cultural complex spoke Proto-Oceanic, which is a branch of the Austronesian language family widely distributed in Southeast Asia today. However, the particular language or languages spoken by the Lapita is unknown. The languages spoken in the region today derive from a number of different ancient languages, and material culture uncovered by archaeology does not generally provide clues to the language spoken by the makers of the artifacts. Furthermore, certain Lapita groups are likely to have differences in speech and appearance from their relatives in different archipelagos or islands.

Matthew Spriggs sees the Lapita as the source of Oceanic Austronesian languages and of cultural and religious concepts in much of the Pacific.

==Origin==
The Lapita complex is part of the eastern migration branch of the Austronesian expansion, which started from Taiwan between about 5,000 and 6,000 years ago. Some of the emigrants reached Melanesia and were distant descendants of much earlier migrations into the super-continent of Sahul. There are different theories about the route they took to get there. They may have gone through the Marianas Islands, or through the Philippines, or both. The strongest support for the theory that the original people of the Lapita culture were Austronesian is linguistic evidence showing very considerable lexical continuity between Proto-Malayo-Polynesian (presumably spoken in the Philippines) and Proto-Oceanic (presumably spoken by the Lapita people). In addition, the patterns of linguistic continuity correspond to patterns of similarity in material culture.

In 2011, Peter Bellwood proposed that the initial movement of Malayo-Polynesian speakers into Oceania was from the northern Philippines eastward into the Mariana Islands, then southward into the Bismarcks. An older proposal was that Lapita settlers first arrived in Melanesia via eastern Indonesia. Bellwood&#x27;s proposal included the possibility that both migration patterns happened, with different migrants taking different routes. Bellwood&#x27;s proposal is supported by the pottery evidence: Lapita pottery is more similar to pottery recovered from the Philippines (at the Nagsabaran archaeological site on Luzon Island) than it is to pottery discovered anywhere else. Other evidence suggests that the Luzon area may have been the original homeland of the stamped pottery tradition that is carried forward in Lapita culture.

Archaeological evidence also broadly supports the theory that the people of the Lapita culture are of Austronesian origin. On the Bismarck Archipelago, around 3,500 years ago, the Lapita complex appears suddenly, as a fully-developed archaeological horizon with associated highly developed technological assemblages. No evidence has been found on the archipelago of settlements in earlier developmental stages. This suggests that the Lapita culture was brought in by a migrating population, and did not – as had been proposed in the 1980s and 1990s by scholars like Jim Allen and J. Peter White – evolve locally.

There is evidence that western Melanesia was continuously occupied by indigenous Papuans beginning between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. That evidence includes recovered artifacts. But those remnants of the older material culture are far less diverse than the relics dating from after the Lapita horizon. The older material culture appears to have contributed only a few elements to the later Lapita material culture: some crops and some tools.

The vast majority of the Lapita material-culture elements are clearly Southeast Asian in origin. These include pottery, crops, paddy field agriculture, domesticated animals (chickens, dogs, and pigs), rectangular stilt houses, tattoo chisels, quadrangular adzes, polished stone chisels, outrigger boat technology, trolling hooks, and various other stone artifacts. Lapita pottery offers the strongest evidence of an Austronesian origin. It has very distinctive elements, like the use of the red slips, tiny punch marks, dentate stamps, circle stamps, and a cross-in-circle motif. Similar pottery has been found in Taiwan, the Batanes and Luzon islands of the Philippines, and the Marianas.

The orthodox view, advocated by Roger Green and Peter Bellwood, and accepted by most specialists today, is the so-called &quot;Triple-I model&quot; (short for &quot;intrusion, innovation, and integration&quot;). This model posits that the Early Lapita culture arose as the result of a three-part process: &quot;intrusion&quot; of the Austronesian peoples of the islands of Southeast Asia (and their language, materials, and ideas) into Near Oceania; &quot;innovation&quot; by the Lapita people, once they reached in Melanesia, in the form of new technologies; and &quot;integration&quot; of the Lapita peoples into the pre-existing (non-Austronesian) populations.

===Archaeogenetics===
In 2016, DNA analysis of four Lapita skeletons found in ancient cemeteries on the islands of Vanuatu and Tonga showed that the Lapita people had descended from inhabitants of Taiwan and of the northern Philippines. This evidence of the Lapita peoples&#x27; migration route was corroborated in 2020 by a study that did a complete mtDNA and genome-wide SNP comparison of the remains of early settlers of the Mariana Islands with the remains of early Lapita individuals from Vanuatu and Tonga. The results suggest that both groups had descended from the same ancient Austronesian source population in the Philippines. The complete absence of &quot;Papuan&quot; admixture in these remains suggest that the voyages of the migrants bypassed eastern Indonesia and the rest of New Guinea. The study authors noted that their results also support the possibility that early Lapita Austronesians were direct descendants of the early colonists of the Marianas (who preceded them by about 150 years); this idea is also consistent with the pottery evidence.

Recent DNA studies show that the Lapita people and modern Polynesians have a common ancestry with the Atayal people of Taiwan and the Kankanaey people of the northern Philippines. 

A 2023 study states that Lapita people already have increased Northeast Asian ancestry (~21–29%) compared to ancient groups that initially settled in Taiwan (~0–8%).

==Discovery==
The first recorded discovery of Lapita materials was by Otto Meyer, a Sacred Heart missionary working on Watom Island in 1909. Meyer discovered potsherds after a tropical storm hit the island and exposed the artifacts. The decorated sherds were sent by Meyer to the Musée de l&#x27;Homme in Paris. In 1920, anthropologist William C. McKern unearthed over 1500 potsherds in the island of Tongatapu as part of a widespread expedition, most with stamped motifs. McKern wasn&#x27;t aware of Meyer&#x27;s discoveries and assumed the sherds were prehistoric Fijian ceramics. The connection between Meyer&#x27;s sherds and those excavated by McKern was made in 1940 with the discovery of pottery on the Ile des Pins. 

In the 1950s, Edward Winslow Gifford, who assisted McKern in 1920, led expeditions that eventually centered on the beach of the Koné Peninsula from where the &quot;Lapita&quot; term was coined. Gifford used the recently invented carbon dating on his excavated charcoal, dating the artifacts between 2,800 and 2,450 years bp. Gifford later demonstrated the connection between the evidence from previous discoveries, including Merye&#x27;s Watom islands sherds and McKern&#x27;s Bayard Dominick expedition. Gifford also proved a relationship between his &quot;Lapita&quot; artifacts and those discovered by Pieter Vincent van Stein Callenfels along the Karama River in Sulawesi. The time scale of the &quot;Lapita model&quot; between these discoveries and additional excavations were proven in the 1960s by Jack Golson, predating the Melanesian cultures and other Western Polynesian cultures. Some of the notable archeological locations include the Lolokoka site in Niuatoputapu and within the Eastern Lapita, the Nenumbo site in the Reef Islands which includes the expansion to the Solomon Islands, and the Talepakemalai in Massau that exemplifies the earliest Lapita group within the Bismarck archipelago.

==Lapita in Polynesia==

As the archaeological record improved in the 1980s and 1990s, the Lapita people were found to be the original settlers in parts of Melanesia and Western Polynesia. Many scientists believe Lapita pottery in Melanesia to be proof that Polynesian ancestors passed through this area on their way into the central Pacific. The earliest archaeological site in Polynesia is in Tonga.

Other early Lapita discovery sites dating back to 900 BCE are also found in Tonga and contain the typical pottery and other archaeological &quot;kit&quot; of Lapita sites in Fiji and eastern Melanesia of about that time and immediately before.

Anita Smith compares the Polynesian Lapita period with the later Polynesian Plainware ceramic period in Polynesia:

&quot;There do not appear to be new or different kinds of evidence associated with plain-ware ceramics (&amp; lapita), only the disappearance of a minor component of material culture and faunal assemblages is apparent. There is continuity in most aspects of the archaeological record that appears to mimic post Lapita sequences of Fiji and island Melanesia (Mangaasi and Naviti pottery).&quot;

Plainware pottery is found on many Western Polynesian islands and marks a transitional period between when only Lapita pottery was found and a later period before the settlement of Eastern Polynesia when the Western Polynesians of the time had given up pottery production altogether. Archaeological evidence indicates that plainware pottery ceases abruptly in Samoa around 1 CE.

According to Smith:

&quot;Ceramics were not manufactured by Polynesian societies at any time in East Polynesian prehistory&quot;.

Matthew Spriggs stated: &quot;The possibility of cultural continuity between Lapita Potters and Melanesians has not been given the consideration it deserves. In most sites there was an overlap of styles with no stratigraphic separation discernible. Continuity is found in pottery temper, importation of obsidian and in non-ceramic artefacts&quot;.

<text>Joe Melson (born May 11, 1935) is an American singer and a BMI Award-winning songwriter best known for his collaborations with Roy Orbison, including &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; and &quot;Crying&quot;, which are both in the Grammy Hall of Fame and have both been included in Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Melson was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Life and career==
Joe Melson was born in Bonham, Fannin County, Texas, United States. He was reared on a farm until he was sixteen. He attended high school in Gore, Oklahoma, and in Chicago, Illinois, before he returned to Texas to study at the two-year Odessa College in Odessa, the seat of Ector County. He studied and played music as a teenager and fronted a rockabilly band called the Cavaliers.

Beginning in 1959, first at his home in Midland, Texas, and then in Nashville, Tennessee, Melson teamed up with Roy Orbison, who had just joined Monument Records, with whom he would soon write a string of hits. Before their collaboration, Orbison had been solely a rockabilly performer. Although Melson himself was rooted in that music genre, he had begun writing rhythm and blues songs. Melson recognized the potential in Orbison&#x27;s voice, encouraging the singer to explore its power through their first collaboration, &quot;Only the Lonely.&quot; What resulted on March 25, 1960, was arguably the first operatic rock ballad. The song went to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the United States, and to No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, launching Orbison to international musical stardom.

Not only did that song influence Orbison to write such operatic ballads as &quot;In Dreams,&quot; but a few months later it also inspired Orbison&#x27;s friend Elvis Presley to record &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never,&quot; based on the Neapolitan art song &quot;&#x27;O sole mio.&quot;

Melson and Orbison followed up with similar sounds such as the dramatic &quot;Running Scared&quot; that went to No. 1 in the US. His last hit collaboration with Orbison came in 1963 with the writing of &quot;Blue Bayou,&quot; although some of their cooperative efforts would be recorded in later years. The two got together again between 1971 and 1975.

Their collaboration produced such songs as:
*&quot;Up Town&quot; (1960, #72 Billboard pop chart)
*&quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1960, #2)
*&quot;Blue Angel&quot; (1960, #9)
*&quot;I&#x27;m Hurtin&#x27;&quot; (1961, #27)
*&quot;Running Scared&quot; (1961, #1)
*&quot;Crying&quot; (1961, #2)
*&quot;The Crowd&quot; (1962, #26)
*&quot;The Actress&quot; (1962)
*&quot;Lana&quot; (1962)
*&quot;Blue Bayou&quot; (1963, #29)

Between 1960 and 1963, Melson recorded several singles of his own (the best known being &quot;Hey Mister Cupid&quot;) for Hickory Records and also through Acuff-Rose Music, wrote songs for some of that label&#x27;s other artists including Dan Folger. He then recorded a few songs for EMP Records in 1964 and 1965 that achieved limited success. He was the cowriter of &quot;Run, Baby Run (Back Into My Arms)&quot;, which was a #12 Billboard hit for The Newbeats, released in 1965. Melson cowrote a top-30 country hit for Don Gibson in 1968 and then cowrote two songs that were top-30 country hits for Glenn Barber in 1972, with a third in 1979.

&quot;Only the Lonely&quot; went to number one on the country charts in 1969 for Sonny James. &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; was a #3 hit for Linda Ronstadt in 1977 and &quot;Crying&quot; was a top-10 hit for Don McLean in 1981.

Over the years, Melson continued to perform at rockabilly and nostalgia festivals, and in 2002 he was inducted into the International Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame in Jackson, Tennessee.

In August 2014, Melson released a triple-A sided single &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; / &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; / &quot;Girl Back on Blue Bayou&quot; with Australian artist Damien Leith.

<doc id="456517" wikidata="Q499111" url="?curid=456517" title="Waitangi, Northland">
<text>Waitangi is a locality on the north side of the Waitangi River in the Bay of Islands, north of Whangārei, on the North Island of New Zealand. It is close to the town of Paihia, to which it is connected by a bridge near the mouth of the Waitangi River estuary. While Statistics New Zealand and NZ Post consider the southern boundary of Waitangi to be the river and estuary, with the area further south being part of Paihia, the area by Te Tī Bay, immediately south of the river, is sometimes referred to as part of Waitangi. 

The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed at Waitangi on 6 February 1840. It is also the place where the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand was signed five years earlier, on 28 October 1835. This document was ratified by the British Crown the following year (1836).

&quot;Waitangi&quot; is a Māori-language name meaning &quot;noisy waters&quot; or &quot;weeping waters&quot;, probably referring to the Haruru Falls on the Waitangi River.

==History==
===Signing of Treaty of Waitangi===

The Treaty of Waitangi proper began on 5 February 1840 when a public meeting was held on the grounds in front of James Busby&#x27;s residence. Lieutenant Governor Hobson read a proposed document to the 300 or so European and Māori who were in attendance and then provided the Māori chiefs an opportunity to speak. Initially, a large number of chiefs (including Te Kemara, Rewa and Moka Te Kainga-mataa) spoke against accepting the Crown&#x27;s proposition to rule over Aotearoa. Later in the proceedings a few chiefs began to entertain the idea; amongst the more notable chiefs to support the Crown were Te Wharerahi, Pumuka, and the two Hokianga chiefs, Tāmati Wāka Nene and his brother Eruera Maihi Patuone.

The proceedings were ended and were to recommence on 7 February; however, a number of chiefs pressed to sign earlier. The Treaty of Waitangi was initially signed on 6 February 1840 in a marquee erected in the grounds of James Busby&#x27;s house at Waitangi by representatives of the British Crown, the chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and other Māori tribal leaders, and subsequently by other Māori chiefs at other places in New Zealand. Not all of the chiefs chose to sign this document, with a number of chiefs either delaying or refusing to put pen to paper.

In 2007, researcher Brent Kerehona claimed that uncertainty has arisen over whether Ngapuhi chief Moka Te Kainga-mataa actually signed; despite his name appearing on this document. A close inspection of the Treaty document itself shows no evidence of a signature or &#x27;mark&#x27; next to Moka&#x27;s name (which is written as &#x27;Te Tohu o Moka&#x27;). Kerehona elaborates by inferring that it is clear by the accounts of Colenso (1890) that not only did Moka clearly express his concerns about the Treaty&#x27;s effects whilst at the meeting on February 5, but that the discussion that he had with the Reverend Charles Baker, combined with Moka&#x27;s final comment, should be taken into account.

The Treaty of Waitangi followed on from The Declaration of Independence (He Whakaputanga) but did not render it void.

==Treaty Grounds==
Waitangi Treaty Grounds has been open to the public since 1934. What is now called the &#x27;Treaty House&#x27; was first occupied by James Busby, who acted as the British resident in New Zealand from 1832 until the arrival of William Hobson, and his wife Agnes Busby. The Treaty House was restored in the 1930s, in preparation for New Zealand Centenary in 1940, sparking the first emergence of the Treaty into Pākehā attention since the 19th century.

Te Whare Rūnanga, a carved Māori meeting house, was built near the Treaty House in 1939 and opened on 6 February 1940. The area of the whare is sometimes used as if it is a marae and referred to as the &quot;upper marae&quot;, although it is not a true marae. There is a marae, Te Tii Waitangi, in Te Tī Bay on the south side of the Waitangi River that is sometimes referred to as the &quot;lower marae&quot;.

Te Kōngahu Museum of Waitangi opened on the grounds in 2015. Another museum, Te Rau Aroha, opened in 2020.

In early November 2024, the Sixth National Government allocated NZ$10.2 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund for building upgrades and repairs at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds.

The Waitangi Wharf is at the mouth of the Waitangi River estuary, and is used by passenger ferry services between Russell and Paihia. In 1990, artist Selwyn Muru requisitioned copper from the historic wharf piles, and incorporated these into &quot;Waharoa&quot;, a sculpture located in Aotea Square, Auckland.
