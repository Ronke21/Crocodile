<text>Schöllkrippen is a market community in the Aschaffenburg district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany and seat of the &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; (municipal association) of Schöllkrippen. It has a total population of around 4,300 (2020).

==Geography==
===Location===

Schöllkrippen is the largest settlement of the Kahlgrund and lies on the river Kahl on the western edge of the Spessart (range). The main &quot;Ortsteil&quot; of Schöllkrippen lies at the foot of the Reuschberg.

===Subdivisions===
Schöllkrippen&#x27;s &quot;Ortsteile&quot; are Schöllkrippen, and .

Schöllkrippen &quot;Ortsteil&quot; consists of the following &quot;Orte&quot;: , , , Röderhof, and Schöllkrippen proper.

===Neighbouring communities===
The neighbouring communities are from the north (clockwise): Westerngrund, Kleinkahl, (an unincorporated area), Sommerkahl, Blankenbach, Krombach and Geiselbach.

==History==

Schöllkrippen has long been the central settlement of the Upper Kahlgrund and a meeting point of roads at least since the Middle Ages. Old long distance trade routes such as the &quot;Birkenhainer Straße&quot; and the &quot;Eselsweg&quot; pass nearby. 

What had in the past been considered a prehistoric Celtic circular rampart, the &quot;Alte Burg&quot; or &quot;Altenburg&quot; on the nearby Reuschberg, is now thought to date to medieval times.

The church St. Katharina is first mentioned in a document in 1184. In 1449, the Lukaskapelle is built.

Due to its location, the town served as seat of the local administration of the Archbishops of Mainz In 1338, it became the seat of one of six &quot;Forsthuben&quot; in the Spessart territory controlled by Mainz. For a long time, Schöllkrippen also was a border town, as the river Kahl was the border to the &quot;Krombacher Landgericht&quot;, which from 1666 until its integration into the Kingdom of Bavaria was owned by the Counts of Schönborn.

In 1814, Schöllkrippen came to the Kingdom of Bavaria and was granted town rights.

In 1898, the &quot;Kahlgrundbahn&quot; (railway) commenced service between Schöllkrippen and Kahl am Main, creating economic impetus for the region by linking it to the national railway system.

==Economy==
Schöllkrippen&#x27;s central location in the Kahlgrund has led the market community to grow into a local shopping hub since the mid-1990s. The many discount retailers serve not only customers from the Spessart from Wiesen through Heigenbrücken to Heinrichsthal, but also from the upper Kahlgrund from Geiselbach to Blankenbach and the middle Kahlgrund from Königshofen through Mömbris to Niedersteinbach along with Eichenberg, Rottenberg and Feldkahl.

After the carwash manufacturer WashTec withdrew from its Schöllkrippen location at the Augsburg-based mother company’s behest, the sprawling halls and plots of land on the Ernstkirchen &quot;Gemarkung&quot; (traditional rural cadastral area, this one lying on the way out of the community towards Blankenbach) lay empty for nearly three years. In mid-2006, the community managed to sell the &quot;Industriepark Ernstkirchen&quot; to various firms. Roughly two thirds of the area went to the firm Ferratec from Hösbach, who then housed their production equipment here. The rest was shared among four smaller firms as well as the market community of Schöllkrippen, which built a new building yard there.

In late 2004, Schöllkrippen was chosen as the most livable place in the Bavarian Lower Main (&quot;Bayerischer Untermain&quot;). 

==Governance==

The market community (&quot;&quot;) is the administrative seat of the &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; of Schöllkrippen, which, besides Schöllkrippen, includes the communities of Blankenbach, Kleinkahl, Krombach, Sommerkahl, Westerngrund and Wiesen. Schöllkrippen has held the status of &quot;market&quot; since 1963.
===Town council===

The council is made up of 16 council members, not counting the mayor.

(as at municipal election held on 2 March 2008)

===Coat of arms===
The community’s arms might be described thus: Per fess gules a wheel spoked of six argent, Or in base a mount of three vert issuant therefrom three morningstars sable, the dexter in bend, the middle in pale and the sinister in bend sinister.

The arms were designed sometime about 1950.

After the Counts of Rieneck died out in 1559, Schöllkrippen passed to the Archbishopric of Mainz, with which it stayed from 1670 to 1803. As early as 1670, the Bishops of Mainz held great parts of the area around Schöllkrippen. For this hegemony stands the six-spoked silver wheel – the Wheel of Mainz – on the red field. The tinctures gules and argent (red and silver) were Mainz’s colours. The three morningstars below the partition are taken from a seal of the &quot;Amt&quot; of Schöllkrippen, whose circumscription read “SIG. AMPT SCHÖLLKRIPPEN”. Although this does indeed mention the name Schöllkrippen, it was surely no municipal seal, but rather more likely a local official’s personal coat of arms. Strengthening this assumption are the letters M and W on each side of the arms, although any official in Schöllkrippen at that time with these initials is thus far unknown. Because the morningstars were such an unusual charge, they were chosen for the community’s new coat of arms, which has been borne since 1954.

==Attractions==
The town centre features the medieval &quot;Lukaskapelle&quot;, a small fortified church (1449). The former &quot;Schloss&quot; nearby is now the seat of the local administration. Its original moat and curtain wall have been removed. The &quot;Sackhaus&quot;, which was used to store local taxes paid in goods, is today the largest half-timbered building in town. Its oldest part dates to 1473.

The church St. Katharina in Ernstkirchen was mentioned first in 1184. In the 14th century, the original Romanesque church was reconstructed with a Gothic vaulted ceiling and an octagonal tower. Over the centuries, the church was redesigned several times in different styles (Baroque, Gothic Revical), but in 1958/67 the church was mostly returned to its early Gothic state (although the tower roof retains its Baroque onion shape). During this renovation, an early medieval stone tablet of unknown date was discovered, which indicates a very early ecclesial presence at this location. About one meter in height, stylistically, it has been linked to the Hiberno-Scottish mission. The tablet shows a Crux gemmate surrounded by other symbols that are hard to identify, including possible moon and sun symbols and a type of &quot;checkers board&quot;. It likely was removed from a visible position in the church around the year 1300 and buried beneath the altar. 

The &quot;&quot; on the peak of the Reuschberg is a sort of circular rampart, with remains of both earth and masonry walls, long thought to date to the La Tène period. However, excavations in 2005 indicate that it most likely is a 10th-century refuge castle, with some elements added later (11th or 12th century). Over the centuries, locals have used the fortification as a source of construction materials, reducing the remains to just foundations. The fortifications are roughly oval in form and encompass an area of roughly 1,300 square meters. A break in the wall likely once served as a gate. Research also revealed signs of internal buildings, including the foundation of a central tower.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
Schöllkrippen is the seat of the &quot;Kahlgrund Verkehrs-GmbH&quot; (KVG; &quot;Kahlgrund Transport Company, Limited&quot;), which runs the railway line to Kahl am Main. This has been served since 11 December 2005 by trains of the &quot;Hessische Landesbahn&quot; (&quot;Hessian State Railway&quot; – even though Schöllkrippen is in Bavaria), most of which go to the main railway station in Hanau. The KGV also runs its extensive bus network in the north Spessart as far as Aschaffenburg. With route changes, this has been expanded into neighbouring Hesse. New bus connections to Gelnhausen, Freigericht/Somborn and Heigenbrücken were brought into service on 10 December 2006 to afford the region of the upper Kahlgrund and its many commuters better links to neighbouring Hesse.

Schöllkrippen is connected to the road network as follows:
*Autobahn A 3 (through the Hösbach interchange), between Frankfurt (roughly 50 km away) and Würzburg (roughly 80 km away).
*Autobahn A 45 (through the Alzenau interchange), between Gießen (90 km away) and Aschaffenburg (roughly 20 km away).
*Autobahn A 66 (through the Gelnhausen/West interchange), between Fulda (90 km away) and Gelnhausen/Hanau (roughly 15 and 30 km away, respectively).
* &quot;Staatsstraßen&quot; (State Roads) 2305 (Frammersbach-Schöllkrippen-Alzenau) and 2306 (Schöllkrippen-Geiselbach-Gelnhausen).

==Education==
The district&#x27;s biggest &quot;Hauptschule&quot; served an estimated 550 students in the 2007/2008 school year. The school takes in pupils from Heigenbrücken, Heinrichsthal, Geiselbach and Krombach.

<doc id="450235" wikidata="Q506072" url="?curid=450235" title="Mömbris">
<text>Mömbris is a community – since 31 January 1964 a market community – in the Aschaffenburg district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany. With over 11,000 inhabitants, Mömbris is the district&#x27;s fifth largest community.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Mömbris lies in the Bavarian Lower Main (&quot;Bayerischer Untermain&quot;) in the Kahlgrund halfway between Schöllkrippen and Alzenau, which are linked by &quot;Staatsstraße&quot; (State Road) 2305, at the foot of the Vorspessart (range) with its highest elevation, the Hahnenkamm at 437 m above sea level. The river Kahl flows through Mömbris.

Mömbris comprises all together 18 centres in an area of 35.92 km2. The greater share (32.81 km2) is woods, meadows and cropland. The community lies between 165 and 337 m above sea level.

=== Constituent communities ===

Mömbris&#x27;s &quot;Ortsteile&quot; are as follows:
=== Amalgamations ===
*As of 1818, Brücken, Strötzbach, Rappach, Heimbach, Gunzenbach, Rothengrund, Angelsberg and Molkenberg were part of Mömbris.
*The first communities merged into the market community of Mömbris, with effect from 1 January 1972, were Daxberg, Hemsbach and Mensengesäß.
*On 1 July 1972 the community of Niedersteinbach followed.
*On 1 January 1974 Dörnsteinbach and Hohl were amalgamated.
*The community of Reichenbach merged on 1 January 1976.
*Schimborn, which had already been merged with Königshofen a.d.Kahl in 1971 to form the community of Schimborn, was amalgamated along with its outlying centre into Mömbris on 1 May 1978.

=== Bavaria-Hesse boundary ===
Hesse pokes a tongue of its territory into the market community. In 2007, a territorial exchange involving roughly 10 hectares of land was undertaken between Hesse and Bavaria, whereby the latter shrank by 1.77 hectares.

Until this time, the state boundary ran right through the FV Viktoria 1930 e. V. Brücken (football club) clubhouse. Elsewhere, the boundary also cut through a short stretch of &quot;Staatsstraße&quot; 2305 – a road administered by Bavaria – in the outlying centre of Niedersteinbach, meaning that this Bavarian-owned road ran for a short distance through Hesse; this stretch of road came to be known as the &quot;Hessenkurve&quot;.

== History ==
The Mömbris tithe court belonged until 1748, along with those of Alzenau and Hörstein and the free court to the Wilmundsheim vor der Hart (Alzenau) &quot;Markgenossenschaft&quot; (a kind of collective arrangement in which several villages jointly owned land resources). Free &quot;Märker&quot; (&quot;Markgenossenschaft&quot; dwellers) gathered every year in Alzenau to choose a &quot;Landrichter&quot; (judge) and foresters and to deal with important decisions.

The tithe courts originally had Imperial immediacy. Chairmanship was held by a tithe count chosen to serve for one year. Each village supplied, commensurately with each one&#x27;s number of freemen, &quot;Schöffen&quot; (roughly “lay jurists”) whose job it was to mete out justice. In 1500, the tithe courts lost their Imperial immediacy along with its attendant privileges. Ecclesiastical jurisdiction was thereafter exercised by the Archbishopric of Mainz.

Mömbris became under the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in 1803 part of the newly formed Principality of Aschaffenburg, ruled by Prince primate Karl Theodor von Dalberg, with which it passed in 1814 (by this time it had become a department of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt) to Bavaria.

== Government==

=== Mayors ===
*Georg Grünewald (1876–1910)
*August Grünewald (1911–1938)
*Gottfried van Treek (1939–1945)
*Anton Volk (1945)
*Leopold Wissel (1945–1951)
*Anton Reising (CSU) (1951–1986)
*Michael Schneemeier (SPD) (1986–1998)
*Reinhold Glaser (CSU) (1998–2008)
*Felix Wissel (SPD/independent) (2008–)

=== Community council ===

The council is made up of 25 council members, counting the full-time mayor.

(as at municipal election held on 2 March 2008)

=== Town twinning===
* Pré-Bocage with its communes of Aunay-sur-Odon, Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé and Villers-Bocage, Calvados, France

=== Coat of arms ===
The community&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Gules a sword argent palewise the hilt and pommel Or, dexter a wheel of the second spoked of six, sinister a crown proper with four leaves.

Mömbris was until 1500 a kingly estate, as witnessed by the crown on the sinister (armsbearer&#x27;s left, viewer&#x27;s right) side. The place was also the seat of a free court, symbolized by the sword. In 1487, Electoral Mainz managed to acquire a share of sovereignty over the area, and in 1738, this became total. The six-spoked wheel (Wheel of Mainz) on the dexter (armsbearer&#x27;s right, viewer&#x27;s left) side recalls this.

In 1963, Mömbris was granted market rights.

The arms were designed and introduced in 1961.

== Economy==
The high population figure belies Mömbris&#x27;s scattered, agricultural character, for since the sweeping municipal reform in the late 1970s, Mömbris has been made up of 18 constituent communities. These are mainly small centres with 200 to 1,000 inhabitants, the exceptions being Schimborn (1,800) and the namesake centre Mömbris (2,000), giving the market community of Mömbris a population of some 12,000 in 2004. Over the last few years, Mömbris has had to deal with a fall in population and economic problems (loss of buying power in the neighbouring Kahlgrund towns of Schöllkrippen and Alzenau). Mömbris has repeatedly been Bavaria&#x27;s most indebted municipality in proportion to its population.

According to official statistics, there were 1,038 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls working in agriculture, forestry and producing businesses in 1998. In trade and transport this was 410. In other areas, 398 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls were employed, and 4,435 such workers worked from home. There were 3 processing businesses. Twenty-nine businesses were in construction, and furthermore, in 1999, there were 117 agricultural operations with a working area of 1 240 ha, of which 592 ha was cropland and 613 ha was meadowland.

==Sports==
Mömbris is home to the &quot;Bundesliga&quot; wrestling team RWG Mömbris-Königshofen.

== Education ==
In 1999, the following institutions were to be found in Mömbris:
*kindergartens: 495 kindergarten places with 471 children
*primary schools: 5 with 46 teachers and 985 pupils

== Notable people ==

=== Honorary citizens ===
* since 2004 Auxiliary Bishop Helmut Bauer (of the Archdiocese of Würzburg)

=== Sons and daughters of the town ===
* Father (born 29 July 1898 in Mömbris; died 24 December 1952 in Munich), Professor of Church Law, in 1939 Rector of the Germanicum in Rome and in 1945 Papal diplomat in Kronberg im Taunus. In his memory, the community named the primary school built in 1959 &quot;Ivo-Zeiger-Schule&quot; and the ecclesiastical community centre &quot;Ivo-Zeiger-Haus&quot;.
* Peter Behl (born 12 February 1966 in Mömbris), wrestler

=== Others linked to the community ===
* (born 2 October 1902 in Burgbrohl; died 9 March 1970 in Mömbris), district councillor for the former Alzenau district
* (born 1 November 1978 in Alzenau-Wasserlos) is a German &quot;Bundesliga&quot; wrestler and Chief Mayor of Mömbris.

<text>Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH is a glider manufacturer based in Kirchheim unter Teck, Germany.

==History==
Martin Schempp founded his own company in Göppingen in 1935, with the assistance of Wolf Hirth.

The company was initially called &quot;Sportflugzeugbau Göppingen Martin Schempp&quot;. In 1938, Wolf Hirth, mainly responsible for the design work, officially became a partner in the company, which then became &quot;Sportflugzeugbau Schempp-Hirth&quot;. The company relocated to Kirchheim unter Teck the same year.

The company&#x27;s first product was the Göppingen Gö 1 &quot;Wolf&quot; glider, conceived as a rival to the ubiquitous Grunau Baby, but real success came with the Göppingen Gö 3 &quot;Minimoa&quot; the same year.

During World War II, the company built DFS Habicht training gliders, as well as tailplane assemblies for the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The company also built a research aircraft, the Göppingen Gö 9 to investigate Claude Dornier&#x27;s rear-mounted &quot;pusher&quot; propeller plans. With its cruciform tail, this aircraft was to be a stepping-stone towards the revolutionary Dornier Do 335 &quot;Pfeil&quot;.

After the war, forbidden by the allied occupation from building aircraft, the company manufactured beds, wheelbarrows, radio cabinets, and other furniture. In 1951, the prohibitions were lifted and the company returned to sailplane building.

Wolf Hirth died in 1959 but it was not until 1964 that Martin Schempp found a new designer: Klaus Holighaus who had just graduated from Darmstadt Technical University, where he was a member of its Akaflieg. Holighaus was also an excellent pilot and became a regular member of the German gliding team.

Additional technical expertise was recruited in 1970 and Holighaus became Chief Executive in 1972. From 1977 Holighaus was the sole owner of the business.

After Holighaus&#x27;s death in a gliding accident in 1994, control of the company passed to his widow and sons, all of whom are keen glider pilots.

It employs about 100 people, and is currently managed by Tilo Holighaus and Brigitte Holighaus.

The company has often sub-contracted work, and has issued licences for other companies to build its designs.

<text>Heigenbrücken is a municipality in the Aschaffenburg district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany, and seat of the &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; (municipal association) of Heigenbrücken. It has a population of around 2,200.

==Geography==

===Location===
Heigenbrücken lies in the Bavarian Lower Main (&quot;Bayerischer Untermain&quot;) in the middle of the Spessart (range).

===Constituent communities===

Heigenbrücken has one outlying &quot;Ortsteil&quot;, Jakobsthal, located about 5 km away from the main town.

==History==
In 1477, Heigenbrücken had its first documentary mention as &quot;Heygerbruch&quot;. During Secularization/Mediatization, Heigenbrücken, along with the Archbishopric of Mainz, passed to the newly formed Principality of Aschaffenburg, with which it passed in 1814 (by this time it had become a department of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt) to the Kingdom of Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, the current community came into being with the &quot;Gemeindeedikt&quot; (&quot;Municipal Edict&quot;) of 1818.

Heigenbrücken lies on an old road leading through the Spessart between Würzburg and Aschaffenburg. 

==Demographics==
The municipal area had 2,330 inhabitants in 1970, 2,332 in 1987 and 2,499 in 2000.
===Religion===
* Catholic: 1,961
* Evangelical: 255
* other: 376
==Economy==
The municipal tax revenue in 1999 amounted to €935,000.

===Agriculture and forestry===
According to official statistics, there were 20 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls working in agriculture and forestry in 1998. In producing businesses this was 59, and in trade and transport 11. In other areas, 97 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls are employed, and 782 such workers work from home. There is one processing business. Three businesses are in construction, and furthermore, in 1999, there were no agricultural operations.

==Arts and culture==
===Museum===
A privately run small motorcycle museum &quot;Moppedscheune&quot; shows motorcycles and accessories from the 1930s to the 1970s.

==Governance==
===Community council===

The council is made up of 15 council members, counting the mayor.

(as at municipal election held on 2 March 2008)

===Mayor===
The mayor is Jochen Drechsler, elected in 2020.

===Coat of arms===
The community has borne arms since June 1977.

The community&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Argent a gurgle glass gules palewise between two oak leaves vert palewise, in base a mound of the third surmounted by a tunnel portal masoned of the first with a tunnel sable.

The &quot;Schwarzkopftunnel&quot;, which at the building of the &quot;Ludwig-Westbahn&quot; (railway) was said to be a special technical achievement, and which is the community&#x27;s landmark, was included as a charge in the arms. The two oak leaves refer to the community&#x27;s geographical location in the Spessart, which has a wealth of oak trees. The “gurgle glass” (for want of a better translation – the German blazon calls for a &quot;Kutterolf&quot;, also known in German as an &quot;Angster&quot; or a &quot;Gluckerflasche&quot;) is a bottle or drinking vessel of a kind known since 3rd-century Cologne, and which was in use up until the 19th century; the charge stands for the once important glass industry in the community. Referring to the community&#x27;s former allegiance to the Electorate of Mainz are the tinctures argent and gules (silver and red).

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
Heigenbrücken lies on the Aschaffenburg-Würzburg long-distance railway line of the Main-Spessart railway. 

The old Heigenbrücken railway station lies just east of the top-most tunnel, the &quot;Schwarzkopftunnel&quot; (built in 1854), which also appears in the community&#x27;s arms. From a railway signalling point of view, the old 925 m-long &quot;Schwarzkopftunnel&quot; was part of Heigenbrücken railway station. This peculiarity stems from a pushing operation, undertaken until 2017, between Laufach and Heigenbrücken. Heavy goods trains came to a stop at Laufach station, where a helper locomotive joined the train&#x27;s tail end to help the train&#x27;s main locomotive get the train up the Spessart Ramp, which reached a steepness of 1:47 (some 21‰). The tunnel itself was built with no gradients to speak of. Just before the tunnel portal, the helper locomotive left the goods train, which by then had covered the steepest gradient and continued on its way southeastwards. So that the helper locomotive did not need to go through the tunnel and into the passenger transport complex (which would lead to disruption of normal operations), the tracks at the Aschaffenburg (that is to say, far) end of the tunnel were arranged in a way that allowed it to cross over to the other track and travel back to Laufach. The points needed for this also belonged to the Heigenbrücken signal box, meaning that the old Heigenbrücken station formally stretched right through the tunnel.

In June 2017, after four years of construction and at a cost of approximately €450 million, the track between Laufach and Heigenbrücken was moved and four new tunnels replaced the &quot;Schwarzkopftunnel&quot;. This realignment of the route necessitated the construction of a new stop for Heigenbrücken, replacing the old station to the west of the town center. The new stop, called &quot;Haltepunkt Heigenbrücken&quot;, is located to the east of the town center, consisting of a two-track island platform, adjacent to the eastern portals of the &quot;Falkenbergtunnel&quot;. It features a number of improvements, including higher platforms, LED lighting, a passageway under track one, a wheelchair/stroller accessible ramp and more. The first trains stopped/passed on 15 June 2017.

In addition to the &quot;Falkenbergtunnel&quot; (approximately 2600 m, making it the longest tunnel in the group), there is the &quot;Hirschbergtunnel&quot; (525 m, north tunnel, 375 m, south tunnel) &quot;Metzbergtunnel&quot; (629 m), &quot;Haintunnel&quot; (745 m). The new tunnels feature a number of new safety features including a powerful fire suppression system. Trains have been allowed to double their speed through the new tunnels from the previous speed limit of 70 km/h (43 mph) to 140 km/h (87 mph). Pushing operations for freight trains ceased when the new tunnels went into service. 

All tracks and railway infrastructure leading to the closed &quot;Schwarzkopftunnel&quot; have been removed and the tunnel itself will be filled in. The tunnel exit with two carved lions is a protected monument and will be preserved. The newly reclaimed land of the old railway will be put to mixed residential/commercial use. 

There is also limited bus service to and from Heigenbrücken.

St2317 connects Heigenbrücken to Bundesstrasse 26 (Aschaffenburg to Lohr).

==Education==
The following institutions are to be found in Heigenbrücken (as at 1999):
*Kindergartens: 100 kindergarten places with 79 children.
*Elementary school: 1 with 17 teachers and 312 pupils.

<text>Jiajing (; 28 January 1522 – 8 February 1567) was the era name (&quot;nianhao&quot;) of the Jiajing Emperor, the 12th emperor of the Ming dynasty. The Jiajing era lasted for 45 years, making it the second-longest era of the Ming. The era name &quot;Jiajing&quot; comes from the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;jiajing yin bang&quot;; translated by James Legge, 1879: ..., but admirably and tranquilly presided over the regions of Yin, ...) in the chapter of Wuyi (, Against Luxurious Ease) in the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;. When the Jiajing Emperor ascended the throne, the Cabinet&#x27;s candidate era names were the first &quot;Mingliang&quot; (; meaning &#x27;a wise emperor and virtuous officials&#x27;), followed by &quot;Shaozhi&quot; (; meaning &#x27;inheriting the Hongzhi Restoration&#x27;), and the third &quot;Jiajing&quot;.

On 4 February 1567 (Jiajing 45, 14th day of the 12th month), the Longqing Emperor ascended to the throne and continued to use the Jiajing era name. The following year, the era was changed to Longqing.

<text>Ingrid Lilian Thulin (; 27 January 1926 – 7 January 2004) was a Swedish actress and director who collaborated with filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. She was often cast as harrowing and desperate characters, and earned acclaim from both Swedish and international critics. She won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Brink of Life&quot; (1958) and the inaugural Guldbagge Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for &quot;The Silence&quot; (1963), and was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress BAFTA for &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1972).

==Early life and education==
Thulin was born in Sollefteå, Ångermanland, northern Sweden, the daughter of Nanna (née Larsson) and Adam Thulin, a fisherman. She took ballet lessons as a girl and was accepted by the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1948. 

==Career==
For many years she worked regularly with Ingmar Bergman. Thulin appeared in Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; (1957), &quot;The Magician&quot; (1958, in which she spent much of the film dressed as a boy), &quot;Winter Light&quot; (1962), &quot;The Silence&quot; (1963), &quot;The Rite&quot; (1969) and &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1972).

She shared the Best Actress award at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival and received a Guldbagge Award for Best Actress in 1964, the first year the award was given out, for her performance in &quot;The Silence&quot;.

In 1968, she was cast by Luchino Visconti in his historical epic of Nazi Germany, &quot;The Damned&quot;. Thulin&#x27;s performance earned a National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. In 1976, Thulin was the protagonist of another film with a similar theme, &quot;Salon Kitty&quot;, directed by Tinto Brass.

Winner of the David di Donatello Awards 1974, Thulin was also nominated for the BAFTA Award the same year. In 1980, she was the head of the jury at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival.

== Personal life ==
Her second marriage was with Harry Schein, the founder of the Swedish Film Institute, whom she was married to for more than 30 years until their divorce 1989, although they lived separately for many years before divorcing. She bought an apartment in Paris, France, in the early 1960s, and some years later a beach house in San Felice Circeo, Italy. In 1970, she became a resident of Sacrofano, Italy, where she lived for 34 years. Her memoir was published in 1992 (&quot;Någon jag kände&quot; (&quot;Somebody I knew&quot;); Norstedts Förlag; ).

== Death ==
She returned to Sweden for medical treatment and later died from cancer in Stockholm on 7 January 2004.

== Legacy ==
The municipality of Sollefteå, where Thulin is buried, has given out an Ingrid Thulin Memorial Scholarship annually since 2008. The Scholarship (which is valued at SEK 20,000), is open to any applicants pursuing the arts. It is sponsored by actress Harriet Andersson, Thulin&#x27;s longtime personal friend.

<text>Tung Lung Chau, previously known as Nam Tong Island or Nam Fat Tong is an island located off the tip of the Clear Water Bay Peninsula in the New Territories of Hong Kong. It is also referred to by Hong Kong people as Tung Lung To or Tung Lung Island (). The island is largely uninhabited. Administratively, it belongs to Sai Kung District.

==Geography==
The island has an area of . It forms the eastern boundary of Tathong Channel, which leads into Victoria Harbour through Lei Yue Mun. The northern tip of Tung Lung Chau is separated from the southern tip of Clear Water Bay Peninsula by the narrow Fat Tong Mun Channel (). The highest point of the island is at Nam Tong Peak (), at an altitude of 250m.

==History==
Emperor Duanzong of the Southern Song dynasty once stayed at Kwu Tap () on the island.
The name of Tung Lung Chau (or &quot;Tunglung Island&quot;) was seen in maps since around 1845, superseding the once more prevalent romanization of Tam-too. 

==Sights==
Tung Lung Chau is the site of Tung Lung Fort, which was constructed 300 years ago and recently refurbished.

A prehistoric stone carving can also be found on the island. Measuring 180 cm by 240 cm, it is the largest ancient rock carving in Hong Kong. The stone carving was mentioned in the 1819 &quot;Gazetteer of Xin&#x27;an County&quot;.

There is a Hung Shing Temple on the island, at a location called Nam Tong (). The temple was built before 1931. Inside the temple, a huge rock, called &#x27;Holy Rock&#x27; () by the worshipers, is protruding from the rear wall of the right chamber.

A World War II Japanese small gun emplacement was located near Tathong Point (, Nam Tong Mei), probably to guard Tathong Channel. It is believed that the existence of this facility may have been the reason why the Allies bombed the island.

==Rock climbing==
Tung Lung houses some of the best sport climbing venues in Hong Kong.
*Technical Wall
*Sea Gully Wall

==Conservation==
Tung Lung Fort Special Area was designated as a Special Area under country parks in 1979 and covers 3 hectares. The area contains the fort and a campsite.

Both Tung Lung Fort and the stone carving are declared monuments of Hong Kong.

==Transportation==

On weekends, kai-to service is available from Sam Ka Tsuen, near Lei Yue Mun (Kowloon side) and is operated by Coral Sea Ferry. The round-trip fare for the 30-minute journey was HK$45 in May 2020.

A service from Sai Wan Ho was operated by Lam Kee Ferry until 26 January 2014 and, after a hiatus of eight months, another operator resumed the service for a round-trip fare of HK$55 for adults and HK$40 for children aged 3 and above.

<text>Urban agriculture refers to various practices of cultivating, processing, and distributing food in urban areas. The term also applies to the area activities of animal husbandry, aquaculture, beekeeping, and horticulture in an urban context. Urban agriculture is distinguished from peri-urban agriculture, which takes place in rural areas at the edge of suburbs.

Urban agriculture can appear at varying levels of economic and social development. It can involve a movement of organic growers, &quot;foodies&quot; and &quot;locavores&quot;, who seek to form social networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism. These networks can develop by way of formal institutional support, becoming integrated into local town planning as a &quot;transition town&quot; movement for sustainable urban development. For others, food security, nutrition, and income generation are key motivations for the practice. In either case, the more direct access to fresh vegetable, fruit, and meat products that may be realised through urban agriculture can improve food security and food safety while decreasing food miles, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation.

==History==

Some of the first evidence of urban agriculture comes from early Mesopotamian cultures. Farmers would set aside small plots of land for farming within the city&#x27;s walls. (3500BC) In Persia&#x27;s semi-desert towns, oases were fed through aqueducts carrying mountain water to support intensive food production, nurtured by wastes from the communities. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are another famous - if potentially legendary - regional example. In China, Xi&#x27;an has been continuously inhabited since at least 5000 BC, whose citizens have engaged in urban agriculture at varying degrees during different points of its history. At the Incans&#x27; Machu Picchu, water was conserved and reused as part of the stepped architecture of the city, and vegetable beds were designed to gather sun in order to prolong the growing season. Elsewhere in the Americas, well-documented examples of pre-Columbian Amerindian urban agriculture include the Aztecs&#x27; lake-based chinampas which were crucial to population growth in Mexico Valley&#x27;s cities; Cahokia&#x27;s maize-based economy in the Mississippi River near present-day St. Louis; and the thriving mesa agricultural plots of the cliff-based Pueblo cultures such as Mesa Verde of today&#x27;s Four Corners region, among others.

 The idea of supplemental food production beyond rural farming operations and distant imports is not new. It was used during war and depression times when food shortage issues arose, as well as during times of relative abundance. Allotment gardens emerged in Germany in the early 19th century as a response to poverty and food insecurity. 

In the context of the US, urban agriculture as a widely recognized practice took root in response of the 1893–1897 economic depression in Detroit. In 1894, Mayor Hazen S. Pingree called on outlying citizens of a depression-struck Detroit to lend their properties to the city government ahead of the winter season. The Detroit government would in turn develop these lots as makeshift potato gardens - nicknamed Pingree&#x27;s Potato Patches after the mayor - as potatoes were weather resistant and easy to grow. He intended for these gardens to produce income, food supply, and boost independence during times of hardship. The Detroit project was successful enough that other US cities adopted similar urban agriculture practices. By 1906, the United States Department of Agriculture estimated that over 75,000 schools alone managed urban agriculture programs to provide children and their families with fresh produce. However, it would not be until the First World War that US urban agriculture spread widely.
During World War One, food production became a major national security concern for several countries, including the US. President Woodrow Wilson called upon all American citizens to utilize any available open food growth, seeing this as a way to pull them out of a potentially damaging situation of food insecurity. The National War Garden Committee under the American Forestry Association organized campaigns with patriotic messages such as &quot;Sow the Seeds of Victory&quot;, with the aim of reducing domestic pressure on food production. In so doing, primary agricultural industries could focus on shipping rations to troops in Europe. So called victory gardens sprouted during World War One (emulated later during World War Two) in the US, as well as Canada &amp; the United Kingdom. By 1919, American victory gardens numbered 5 million plots country-wide, and over 500 million pounds of produce was harvested. So efficient were the American urban agriculture programs that surplus foodstuffs were shipped to war-ravaged European nations, in addition to American military forces.

A very similar practice came into use during the Great Depression that provided a purpose, job and food to those who would otherwise be without anything during such harsh times. These efforts helped raise spirits and boost economic growth. Over 2.8 million dollars worth of food was produced from the subsistence gardens during the Depression. Public and government support for Victory Gardens waned during the Interwar Period, with most American sites becoming repurposed for various economic development initiatives.

By World War II, the War/Food Administration set up a National Victory Garden Program that set out to systematically establish functioning agriculture within cities. Indeed, these new victory gardens became the &quot;first line of defense for the country&quot;. Once more, the government supported and encouraged Victory Gardens as a means of national security: domestic pressure on major agricultural industries would be relieved to further augment the war economy. With this new plan in action, as many as 5.5 million Americans took part in the victory garden movement and over nine million pounds of fruit and vegetables were grown a year, accounting for 44% of US-grown produce throughout that time. In the post-war period, the US government gradually stopped assisting urban agriculture programs, partially due to the lack of need of war supplies and partially due to the US fully embracing industrialized food systems.

By the 1950s and 1960s, urban agriculture was more focused on grassroots initiatives spearheaded by politicized social movements, including the African-American Civil Rights. These groups benefited from a great number of vacant lots, left behind during a period of post-war urban to suburban migration. Despite these efforts, vacant lots as a whole became seen as blighted, decaying areas. Some American cities, such as Syracuse, NY once more supported urban agriculture programs, not for food security but to make these vacant lots more appealing. Social and environmental justice groups, such as New York City based Green Guerillas, Seattle-based P-Patch, Boston-based Urban Gardeners, and Philadelphia-based Philadelphia Green, continued to shape American urban agricultural practices during the 1970s. These groups - and many others - reinvigorated interest in urban agriculture, aimed not only at community development but also combating environmental crises.

American urban agriculture initiatives during the 1980s built upon the previous decade&#x27;s focus on community engagement. A natural evolution was sites of urban agriculture entering everyday community roles and consequently requiring more funding than grassroots movements could muster. The US government created an Urban Garden Program, which funded programs in twenty-eight cities who in turn produced roughly twenty-one million dollars of produce. Though some sites of urban agriculture were repurposed for other economic development, the overall trend of the 1980s was an expansion of the practice. The 1990s continued this growth of urban agriculture sites in the US, while also expanding their purposes. A result of this broadening was the division of urban agriculture practitioners based on motivations, organizational structure, and a host of other operational concerns.

Throughout the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s, urban agriculture sites and usages of these sites have continued to grow. Groups managing some sites focus on the economic security and cultural preservation of immigrants, such as the Hmong American communities in various US states. Other groups incorporate urban agriculture programs as part of wider social justice missions, such as those in the city of Wilmington, Delaware. Still others seek to use urban agriculture as a means of combating community-scale food insecurity, as part of wider goals of rewilding cities and human diets, among a multitude of other uses. Much attention has been placed on the practice of urban agriculture in connection to food movements such as alternative food networks, sustainable food networks, and local food movements. Alternative food networks seek to redefine food production, distribution, and consumption by considering the sociocultural elements of local communities and economies. Sustainable food networks are a related concept, but focus more on ecological concerns. Local food networks focus more on the political responses to globalization or concerns with the environmental impacts of industrialized food transportation.

==Main types==
There is no overarching term for agricultural plots in urban areas. Gardens and farms, while not easy to define, are the two main types. According to the USDA, a farm is &quot;any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold.&quot; In Europe, the term &quot;city farm&quot; is used to include gardens and farms. Any plot with produce being grown in it can be considered an urban farm. Size does not matter, it is more about growing produce on your own in your personal plot or garden.

=== Gardens ===
Many communities make community gardening accessible to the public, providing space for citizens to cultivate plants for food, recreation and education. In many cities, small plots of land and also rooftops are used for community members to garden. Community gardens give citizens the opportunity to learn about horticulture through trial and error and get a better understanding of the process of producing food and other plants. All while still being able to feed those people in need from the community. It holds as both a learning experience as well as a means of help for those people in need. A community gardening program that is well-established is Seattle&#x27;s P-Patch. The grassroots permaculture movement has been hugely influential in the renaissance of urban agriculture throughout the world. During the 1960s a number of community gardens were established in the United Kingdom, influenced by the community garden movement in the United States. Bristol&#x27;s Severn Project was established in 2010 for £2500 and provides 34 tons of produce per year, employing people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

=== Farms ===

The first urban agriculture method of growing occurs when family farms maintain their land as the city grows around it. City farms/Urban farms are agricultural plots in urban areas, that have people working with animals and plants to produce food. They are usually community-run gardens seeking to improve community relationships and offer an awareness of agriculture and farming to people who live in urbanized areas. Although the name says urban, urban farming does not have to be in the urban area, it can be in the backyard of a house, or the rooftop of an apartment building. They are important sources of food security for many communities around the globe. City farms vary in size from small plots in private yards to larger farms that occupy a number of acres. In 1996, a United Nations report estimated there are over 800 million people worldwide who grow food and raise livestock in cities. Although some city farms have paid employees, most rely heavily on volunteer labour, and some are run by volunteers alone. Other city farms operate as partnerships with local authorities.

An early city farm was set up in 1972 in Kentish Town, London. It combines farm animals with gardening space, an addition inspired by children&#x27;s farms in the Netherlands. Other city farms followed across London and the United Kingdom. In Australia, several city farms exist in various capital cities. In Melbourne, the Collingwood Children&#x27;s Farm was established in 1979 on the Abbotsford Precinct Heritage Farmlands (the APHF), the oldest continually farmed land in Victoria, farmed since 1838.

In 2010, New York City saw the building and opening of the world&#x27;s largest privately owned and operated rooftop farm, followed by an even larger location in 2012. Both were a result of municipal programs such as The Green Roof Tax Abatement Program and Green Infrastructure Grant Program.

The Philippines has numerous urban farms and other types of UA sites throughout the country. Several notable initiatives and organizations include The Philippine Urban Agriculture Network (PUAN), Gawad Kalinga, and the federal government&#x27;s Urban Agriculture Program. Quezon City, the most populous city in the country, began a &quot;Joy of Farming&quot; program in the 2010s, which to date has implemented 160+ urban farms in backyards, daycare centres, churches and communal spaces as well as purpose-built farm demonstrations. In Metro Manila&#x27;s Taguig, a 300 square meter urban farm built in 2020 was seen as a key player in the city&#x27;s resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic. Fishermen based in Cebu initiated a hybrid farm to table scheme, connecting isolated farming communities to both national and international markets.

In Singapore, hydroponic rooftop farms (which also rely on vertical farming) are appearing. The goal behind these is to rejuvenate areas and workforces that have thus far been marginalized. Simultaneously top level pesticide-free produce will be grown and harvested. As Singapore imports 90+% of its food, urban agriculture is seen as essential to national security, a fact underscored during the Covid-19 pandemic.

On the island of Taiwan, local city governments sometimes support urban agriculture as a means of sustainable ecology, such as Taipei&#x27;s Garden City Initiative. Originally intended to be small-scale, the program was met with unanticipated enthusiasm, for example, 200+ schools were approved for its trial phase out of planned 22. While certain challenges exist towards implementation and management, the program covers multiple types of urban agricultural sites governed by a variety of independent actors and institutions.

Like many countries experiencing rapid (urban) population growth, China is exploring urban agriculture as a means of feeding its growing population; such as in Shanghai and the Megalopolis of the Pearl River Delta. Despite several widespread cultural, architectural, economic, governmental, and social challenges towards implementation, urban agriculture is noted as having numerous positive transformative effects for China ranging from local food security to national economic security.

===Aquaponics systems===

Aquaponics is a closed-loop farming technique that ingeniously combines aquaculture and hydroponics to create a self-sustaining ecosystem. In this mutually beneficial relationship, fish waste serves as a natural fertilizer for the plants, while the plants filter and purify the water for the fish. This ingenious system not only minimizes water usage but also eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers, making it an eco-friendly and resource-efficient method of food production.

The origins of aquaponics can be traced back to the ancient Aztecs in Mexico, who practiced a form of this method by cultivating crops on floating rafts in nutrient-rich waters. In modern times, researchers like Dr. Mark McMurtry and Dr. James Rakocy further developed and popularized aquaponics during the 1970s and 1980s.

In practice, fish are raised in a tank, and their waste releases ammonia. Beneficial bacteria then convert the ammonia into nitrites and nitrates, which serve as essential nutrients for the plants. As the plants take up these nutrients, they cleanse the water, which is recirculated back to the fish tank, completing the sustainable loop.

===Vertical farming===

Vertical farming has emerged as a solution for sustainable urban agriculture, enabling crops to be cultivated in vertically stacked layers or inclined surfaces, within controlled indoor environments. This approach maximizes space utilization and facilitates year-round cultivation, making it an ideal choice for densely populated urban areas with limited land availability.

The concept of vertical farming dates back to the early 20th century, but its recent popularity has surged due to the challenges posed by urbanization and the growing demand for sustainable food production. Vertical farms have gained significant traction globally as they offer solutions to overcome the limitations associated with traditional agriculture.

In practice, vertical farms employ advanced techniques such as hydroponics or aeroponics, allowing plants to grow without soil by using nutrient-rich water or air instead. By utilizing vertical space, these farms achieve higher crop yields per square foot compared to conventional farming methods. The integration of artificial lighting and sophisticated climate control systems ensures optimal conditions for crop growth throughout the year.

Singapore stands at the forefront of the vertical farming movement, embracing this technology-driven agriculture to address its limited land availability and secure food sustainability. As a densely populated city-state, Singapore&#x27;s adoption of vertical farming showcases how innovative approaches to agriculture can effectively tackle the challenges of urban living while promoting sustainable food production. The obstacles that vertical farming must overcome include; training/indoor farming expertise, commercial feasibility and resistance from city people/politicians.

===Indoor farms===

Indoor farming is a method involves cultivating plants indoors, free from the constraints of traditional agriculture such as weather fluctuations and limited land availability.

The concept of indoor farming emerged as a solution to the challenges faced by conventional farming methods. With unpredictable weather patterns and urbanization taking up valuable arable land, indoor farming offers a sustainable alternative.

In practice, indoor farms utilize advanced techniques like hydroponics, aeroponics, or aquaponics to cultivate plants. These systems provide a soil-less environment, ensuring efficient use of resources and optimal plant growth. Climate control systems play a crucial role in maintaining the perfect conditions for crops, regulating temperature, humidity, and lighting. Artificial lighting, often powered by energy-efficient LED technology, ensures that plants receive the right light spectrum for photosynthesis, resulting in healthy and abundant harvests. The ultimate goal of developments includes providing superior agricultural products that meet urban consumers&#x27; safety requirements.

==Perspectives==

===Resource and economic===
The Urban Agriculture Network has defined urban agriculture as:
An industry that produces, processes, and markets food, fuel, and other outputs, largely 
in response to the daily demand of consumers within a town, city, or metropolis, many types of privately and publicly held land and water bodies were found throughout intra-urban and 
peri-urban areas. Typically urban agriculture applies intensive production methods, frequently using and reusing natural resources and urban wastes, to yield a diverse array of land-, water-, and air-based fauna and flora contributing to food security, health, livelihood, and environment of the individual, household, and community.
With rising urbanization, food resources in urban areas are less accessible than in rural areas. This disproportionately affects the poorest communities, and the lack of food access and increased risk of malnutrition has been linked to socioeconomic inequities. Economic barriers to food access are linked to capitalist market structures and lead to &quot;socioeconomic inequities in food choices&quot;, &quot;less... healthful foods&quot;, and phenomena such as food deserts. Additionally, racialized systems of governance of urban poor communities facilitates the increasing prominence of issues such as unemployment, poverty, access to health, educational and social resources, including a community&#x27;s access to healthy food.

Today, some cities have much vacant land due to urban sprawl and home foreclosures. This land could be used to address food insecurity. One study of Cleveland shows that the city could actually meet up to 100% of its fresh produce need. This would prevent up to $115 million in annual economic leakage. Using the rooftop space of New York City would also be able to provide roughly twice the amount of space necessary to supply New York City with its green vegetable yields. Space could be even better optimized through the usage of hydroponic or indoor factory production of food. Growing gardens within cities would also cut down on the amount of food waste. In order to fund these projects, it would require financial capital in the form of private enterprises or government funding.

===Environmental===
The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) defines urban agriculture to include aspects of environmental health, remediation, and recreation:
Urban agriculture is a complex system encompassing a spectrum of interests, from a traditional core of activities associated with the production, processing, marketing, distribution, and consumption, to a multiplicity of other benefits and services that are less widely acknowledged and documented. These include recreation and leisure; economic vitality and business entrepreneurship, individual health and well-being; community health and well being; landscape beautification; and environmental restoration and remediation.
Modern planning and design initiatives are often more responsive to this model of urban agriculture because they fit within the current scope of sustainable design. The definition allows for a multitude of interpretations across cultures and time. Frequently it is tied to policy decisions to build sustainable cities.

Urban farms also provide unique opportunities for individuals, especially those living in cities, to engage with ecological citizenship actively. By reconnecting with food production and nature, urban community gardening teaches individuals the skills necessary to participate in a democratic society. Decisions must be made on a group-level basis to run the farm. Most effective results are achieved when community residents are asked to take on more active roles in the farm.

===Food security===

Access to nutritious food, both economically and geographically, is another perspective in the effort to locate food and livestock production in cities. The tremendous influx of the world population to urban areas has increased the need for fresh and safe food. The Community Food Security Coalition (CFSC) defines food security as:
All persons in a community having access to culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate food through local, non-emergency sources at all times.
Areas faced with food security issues have limited choices, often relying on highly processed fast food or convenience store foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients, which may lead to elevated rates of diet-related illnesses such as diabetes. These problems have brought about the concept of food justice which Alkon and Norgaard (2009; 289) explain that, &quot;places access to healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food in the contexts of institutional racism, racial formation, and racialized geographies... Food justice serves as a theoretical and political bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and environmental justice.&quot;

Some systematic reviews have already explored urban agriculture contribution to food security and other determinants of health outcomes (see)

Urban agriculture is part of a larger discussion of the need for alternative agricultural paradigms to address food insecurity, inaccessibility of fresh foods, and unjust practices on multiple levels of the food system; and this discussion has been led by different actors, including food-insecure individuals, farm workers, educators and academics, policymakers, social movements, organizations, and marginalized people globally.

The issue of food security is accompanied by the related movements of food justice and food sovereignty. These movements incorporate urban agriculture in how they address food-resources of a community. Food sovereignty, in addition to promoting food access, also seeks to address the power dynamics and political economy of food; it accounts for the embedded power structures of the food system, ownership of production, and decision-making on multiple levels (i.e. growing, processing, and distribution): Under this framework, representative decision-making and responsiveness to the community are core features.

=== Agroecological ===

Agroecology is a scientific framework, movement, and applied practice of agricultural management systems that seeks to achieve food sovereignty within food systems. In contrast to the dominant model of agriculture, agroecology emphasizes the importance of soil health by fostering connections between the diverse biotic and abiotic factors present. It prioritizes farmer and consumer well-being, traditional knowledge revival, and democratized learning systems. Transdisciplinarity and diversity of knowledge is a central theme to agroecology, so many urban agroecology initiatives address topics of social justice, gender empowerment, ecological sustainability, indigenous sovereignty, and public participation in addition to promoting food access. For example, agroecology has been integral to social movements surrounding public demand for sustainably grown food free from pesticides and other chemicals.

Under an agroecological framework, urban agriculture alleviates much more than simply food insecurity by also encouraging discourse about all facets of community wellness from physical and mental health to community connectedness. It has the potential to play a role as a &quot;public space, as an economic development strategy, and as a community-organizing tool&quot; while alleviating food insecurity.

==Impact==
In general, Urban and peri urban agriculture (UPA) contributes to food availability, particularly of fresh produce, provides employment and income and can contribute to the food security and nutrition of urban dwellers.

===Economic===
Urban and Peri-urban agriculture (UPA) expands the economic base of the city through production, processing, packaging, and marketing of consumable products. This results in an increase in entrepreneurial activities and the creation of jobs, as well as reducing food costs and improving quality. UPA provides employment, income, and access to food for urban populations, which helps to relieve chronic and emergency food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity refers to less affordable food and growing urban poverty, while emergency food insecurity relates to breakdowns in the chain of food distribution. UPA plays an important role in making food more affordable and in providing emergency supplies of food. Research into market values for produce grown in urban gardens has been attributed to a community garden plot a median yield value of between approximately $200 and $500 (US, adjusted for inflation).

===Social===
Urban agriculture can have a large impact on the social and emotional well-being of individuals. UA can have an overall positive impact on community health, which directly impacts individuals social and emotional well-being. Urban gardens are often places that facilitate positive social interaction, which also contributes to overall social and emotional well-being. Urban agriculture sites have been noted as lowering crime rates generally in local neighborhoods. Many gardens facilitate the improvement of social networks within the communities that they are located. For many neighborhoods, gardens provide a &quot;symbolic focus&quot;, which leads to increased neighborhood pride. Urban agriculture increases community participation through diagnostic workshops or different commissions in the area of vegetable gardens. Activities which involve hundreds of people.

When individuals come together around UA, physical activity levels are often increased. This can also raise serotonin levels akin to working out at a gym. There is the added element of walking/biking to the gardens, further increasing physical activity and the benefits of being outdoors.

UPA can be seen as a means of improving the livelihood of people living in and around cities. Taking part in such practices is seen mostly as an informal activity, but in many cities where inadequate, unreliable, and irregular access to food is a recurring problem, urban agriculture has been a positive response to tackling food concerns. Due to the food security that comes with UA, feelings of independence and empowerment often arise. The ability to produce and grow food for oneself has also been reported to improve levels of self-esteem or of self-efficacy. Households and small communities take advantage of vacant land and contribute not only to their household food needs but also the needs of their resident city. The CFSC states that:
Community and residential gardening, as well as small-scale farming, save household food dollars. They promote nutrition and free cash for non-garden foods and other items. As an example, you can raise your own chickens on an urban farm and have fresh eggs for only $0.44 per dozen.
This allows families to generate larger incomes selling to local grocers or to local outdoor markets while supplying their household with the proper nutrition of fresh and nutritional products. With the popularity of farmers markets recently, this has allowed an even larger income.

Some community urban farms can be quite efficient and help women find work, who in some cases are marginalized from finding employment in the formal economy. Studies have shown that participation from women have a higher production rate, therefore producing the adequate amount for household consumption while supplying more for market sale.

As most UA activities are conducted on vacant municipal land, there have been raising concerns about the allocation of land and property rights. The IDRC and the FAO have published the Guidelines for Municipal Policymaking on Urban Agriculture, and are working with municipal governments to create successful policy measures that can be incorporated in urban planning.

Over a third of US households, roughly 42 million, participate in food gardening. There has also been an increase of 63% participation in farming by millennials from 2008 to 2013. US households participating in community gardening has also tripled from 1 to 3 million in that time frame. Urban agriculture provides unique opportunities to bridge diverse communities together. In addition, it provides opportunities for health care providers to interact with their patients. Thus, making each community garden a hub that is reflective of the community.

===Energy efficiency===

The current industrial agriculture system is accountable for high energy costs for the transportation of foodstuffs. According to a study by Rich Pirog, associate director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, the average conventional produce item travels , using, if shipped by tractor-trailer, of fossil fuel per . The energy used to transport food is decreased when urban agriculture can provide cities with locally grown food. Pirog found that traditional, non-local, food distribution system used 4 to 17 times more fuel and emitted 5 to 17 times more than the local and regional transport.

Similarly, in a study by Marc Xuereb and Region of Waterloo Public Health, it was estimated that switching to locally-grown food could save transport-related emissions equivalent to nearly 50,000 metric tons of , or the equivalent of taking 16,191 cars off the road.

In theory one would save money, but everything is being run on the house&#x27;s power grid most of the time. So prices can vary according to when you water, or how you water, etc.


===Carbon footprint===
As mentioned above, the energy-efficient nature of urban agriculture can reduce each city&#x27;s carbon footprint by reducing the amount of transport that occurs to deliver goods to the consumer. Such areas can act as carbon sinks offsetting some of the carbon accumulation that is innate to urban areas, where pavement and buildings outnumber plants. Plants absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide () and release breathable oxygen (O2) through photosynthesis. The process of Carbon Sequestration can be further improved by combining other agriculture techniques to increase removal from the atmosphere and prevent the release of during harvest time. However, this process relies heavily on the types of plants selected and the methodology of farming. Specifically, choosing plants that do not lose their leaves and remain green all year can increase the farm&#x27;s ability to sequester carbon.

===Reduction in ozone and particulate matter===
The reduction in ozone and other particulate matter can benefit human health. Reducing these particulates and ozone gases could reduce mortality rates in urban areas along with increase the health of those living in cities. 
A 2011 article found that a rooftop containing 2000 m2 of uncut grass has the potential to remove up to 4000 kg of particulate matter and that one square meter of green roof is sufficient to offset the annual particulate matter emissions of a car.

===Soil decontamination===

Vacant urban lots are often victims to illegal dumping of hazardous chemicals and other wastes. They are also liable to accumulate standing water and &quot;grey water&quot;, which can be dangerous to public health, especially left stagnant for long periods. The implementation of urban agriculture in these vacant lots can be a cost-effective method for removing these chemicals. In the process known as Phytoremediation, plants and the associated microorganisms are selected for their chemical ability to degrade, absorb, convert to an inert form, and remove toxins from the soil. Several chemicals can be targeted for removal, including heavy metals (e.g. Mercury and lead), inorganic compounds (e.g. Arsenic and Uranium), and organic compounds (e.g. petroleum and chlorinated compounds like PBCs).

Phytoremeditation is both an environmentally-friendly, cost-effective and energy-efficient measure to reduce pollution. Phytoremediation only costs about $5–$40 per ton of soil being decontaminated. Implementation of this process also reduces the amount of soil that must be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill.

Urban agriculture as a method to mediate chemical pollution can be effective in preventing the spread of these chemicals into the surrounding environment. Other methods of remediation often disturb the soil and force the chemicals contained within it into the air or water. Plants can be used as a method to remove chemicals and also to hold the soil and prevent erosion of contaminated soil decreasing the spread of pollutants and the hazard presented by these lots.

One way of identifying soil contamination is through using already well-established plants as bioindicators of soil health. Using well-studied plants is important because there has already been substantial bodies of work to test them in various conditions, so responses can be verified with certainty. Such plants are also valuable because they are genetically identical as crops as opposed to natural variants of the same species. Typically urban soil has had the topsoil stripped away and has led to soil with low aeration, porosity, and drainage. Typical measures of soil health are microbial biomass and activity, enzymes, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen, available nutrients, porosity, aggregate stability, and compaction. A new measurement is active carbon (AC), which is the most usable portion of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the soil. This contributes greatly to the functionality of the soil food web. Using common crops, which are generally well-studied, as bioindicators can be used to effectively test the quality of an urban farming plot before beginning planting.

===Noise pollution===
Large amounts of noise pollution not only lead to lower property values and high frustration, they can be damaging to human hearing and health. The study &quot;Noise exposure and public health&quot; found that exposure to continual noise is a public health problem. Examples of the detriment of continual noise on humans to include: &quot;hearing impairment, hypertension and ischemic heart disease, annoyance, sleep disturbance, and decreased school performance.&quot; Since most roofs or vacant lots consist of hard flat surfaces that reflect sound waves instead of absorbing them, adding plants that can absorb these waves has the potential to lead to a vast reduction in noise pollution.

===Nutrition and quality of food===
Daily intake of a variety of fruits and vegetables is linked to a decreased risk of chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Urban agriculture is associated with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables which decreases risk for disease and can be a cost-effective way to provide citizens with quality, fresh produce in urban settings.

Produce from urban gardens can be perceived to be more flavorful and desirable than store bought produce which may also lead to a wider acceptance and higher intake. A Flint, Michigan study found that those participating in community gardens consumed fruits and vegetables 1.4 times more per day and were 3.5 times more likely to consume fruits or vegetables at least 5 times daily (p. 1). Garden-based education can also yield nutritional benefits in children. An Idaho study reported a positive association between school gardens and increased intake of fruit, vegetables, vitamin A, vitamin C and fiber among sixth graders. Harvesting fruits and vegetables initiates the enzymatic process of nutrient degradation which is especially detrimental to water soluble vitamins such as ascorbic acid and thiamin. The process of blanching produce in order to freeze or can reduce nutrient content slightly, but not nearly as much as the amount of time spent in storage. Harvesting produce from one&#x27;s own community garden cuts back on storage times significantly.

Urban agriculture also provides quality nutrition for low-income households. Studies show that every $1 invested in a community garden yields $6 worth of vegetables if labor is not considered a factor in investment. Many urban gardens reduce the strain on food banks and other emergency food providers by donating shares of their harvest and providing fresh produce in areas that otherwise might be food deserts. The supplemental nutrition program Women, Infants and Children (WIC) as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have partnered with several urban gardens nationwide to improve the accessibility to produce in exchange for a few hours of volunteer gardening work.

Urban farming has been shown to increase health outcomes. Gardeners consume twice as much fruit and vegetables than non-gardeners. Levels of physical activity are also positively associated with urban farming. These results are seen indirectly and can be supported by the social involvement in an individual&#x27;s community as a member of the community farm. This social involvement helped raise the aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood, boosting the motivation or efficacy of the community as a whole. This increased efficacy was shown to increase neighborhood attachment. Therefore, the positive health outcomes of urban farming can be explained in part by interpersonal and social factors that boost health. Focusing on improving the aesthetics and community relationships and not only on the plant yield, is the best way to maximize the positive effect of urban farms on a neighborhood.

===Economy of scale===
Using high-density urban farming with vertical farms or stacked greenhouses, many environmental benefits can be achieved on a citywide scale that would be impossible otherwise. These systems do not only provide food, but also produce potable water from waste water, and can recycle organic waste back to energy and nutrients. At the same time, they can reduce food-related transportation to a minimum while providing fresh food for large communities in almost any climate.

===Health inequalities and food justice===
A 2009 report by the USDA determined that &quot;evidence is both abundant and robust enough for us to conclude that Americans living in low-income and minority areas tend to have poor access to healthy food&quot;, and that the &quot;structural inequalities&quot; in these neighborhoods &quot;contribute to inequalities in diet and diet-related outcomes&quot;. These diet-related outcomes, including obesity and diabetes, have become epidemic in low-income urban environments in the United States. Although the definition and methods for determining &quot;food deserts&quot; have varied, studies indicate that, at least in the United States, there are racial disparities in the food environment. Thus using the definition of environment as the place where people live, work, play and pray, food disparities become an issue of environmental justice. This is especially true in American inner-cities where a history of racist practices have contributed to the development of food deserts in the low-income, minority areas of the urban core. The issue of inequality is so integral to the issues of food access and health that the Growing Food &amp; Justice for All Initiative was founded with the mission of &quot;dismantling racism&quot; as an integral part of creating food security.

Not only can urban agriculture provide healthy, fresh food options, but also can contribute to a sense of community, aesthetic improvement, crime reduction, minority empowerment and autonomy, and even preserve culture through the use of farming methods and heirloom seeds preserved from areas of origin.

===Environmental justice===
Urban agriculture may advance environmental justice and food justice for communities living in food deserts. First, urban agriculture may reduce racial and class disparities in access to healthy food. When urban agriculture leads to locally grown fresh produce sold at affordable prices in food deserts, access to healthy food is not just available for those who live in wealthy areas, thereby leading to greater equity in rich and poor neighborhoods.
Improved access to food through urban agriculture can also help alleviate psychosocial stresses in poor communities. Community members engaged in urban agriculture improve local knowledge about healthy ways to fulfill dietary needs. Urban agriculture can also better the mental health of community members. Buying and selling quality products to local producers and consumers allows community members to support one another, which may reduce stress. Thus, urban agriculture can help improve conditions in poor communities, where residents experience higher levels of stress due to a perceived lack of control over the quality of their lives.
Urban agriculture may improve the livability and built environment in communities that lack supermarkets and other infrastructure due to the presence of high unemployment caused by deindustrialization. Urban farmers who follow sustainable agricultural methods can not only help to build local food system infrastructure, but can also contribute to improving local air, and water and soil quality. Urban farming serves as one type of green space in urban areas, it has a positive impact on the air quality in the surrounding area. A case study conducted on a rooftop farm shows the PM2.5 concentration in the urban farming area is 7–33% lower than the surrounding parts without green spaces in a city. When agricultural products are produced locally within the community, they do not need to be transported, which reduces emission rates and other pollutants that contribute to high rates of asthma in lower socioeconomic areas. Sustainable urban agriculture can also promote worker protection and consumer rights. For example, communities in New York City, Illinois, and Richmond, Virginia, have demonstrated improvements to their local environments through urban agricultural practices.
However, urban agriculture can also present urban growers with health risks if the soil used for urban farming is contaminated. Lead contamination is particularly common, with hazardous levels of lead found in soil in many United States cities. High lead levels in soil originate from sources including flaking lead paint which was widely used before being banned in the 1970s, vehicle exhaust, and atmospheric deposition. Without proper education on the risks of urban farming and safe practices, urban consumers of urban agricultural produce may face additional health-related issues.

==Implementation==

Creating a community-based infrastructure for urban agriculture means establishing local systems to grow and process food and transfer it from farmer to consumer.

To facilitate food production, cities have established community-based farming projects. Some projects have collectively tended community farms on common land, much like that of the eighteenth-century Boston Common. One such community farm is the Collingwood Children&#x27;s Farm in Melbourne, Australia. Other community garden projects use the allotment garden model, in which gardeners care for individual plots in a larger gardening area, often sharing a tool shed and other amenities. Seattle&#x27;s P-Patch Gardens use this model, as did the South Central Farm in Los Angeles and the Food Roof Farm in St. Louis. Independent urban gardeners also grow food in individual yards and on roofs. Garden sharing projects seek to pair producers with the land, typically, residential yard space. Roof gardens allow for urban dwellers to maintain green spaces in the city without having to set aside a tract of undeveloped land. Rooftop farms allow otherwise unused industrial roofspace to be used productively, creating work and profit. Projects around the world seek to enable cities to become &#x27;continuous productive landscapes&#x27; by cultivating vacant urban land and temporary or permanent kitchen gardens.
 
Food processing on a community level has been accommodated by centralizing resources in community tool sheds and processing facilities for farmers to share. The Garden Resource Program Collaborative based in Detroit has cluster tool banks. Different areas of the city have tool banks where resources like tools, compost, mulch, tomato stakes, seeds, and education can be shared and distributed with the gardeners in that cluster. Detroit&#x27;s Garden Resource Program Collaborative also strengthens their gardening community by providing access to their member&#x27;s transplants; education on gardening, policy, and food issues; and by building connectivity between gardeners through workgroups, potlucks, tours, field trips, and cluster workdays. In Brazil, &quot;Cities Without Hunger&quot; has generated a public policy for the reconstruction of abandoned areas with food production and has improved the green areas of the community.

Farmers&#x27; markets, such as the farmers&#x27; market in Los Angeles, provide a common land where farmers can sell their product to consumers. Large cities tend to open their farmer&#x27;s markets on the weekends and one day in the middle of the week. For example, the farmers&#x27; market of Boulevard Richard-Lenoir in Paris, France, is open on Sundays and Thursdays. However, to create a consumer dependency on urban agriculture and to introduce local food production as a sustainable career for farmers, markets would have to be open regularly. For example, the Los Angeles Farmers&#x27; Market is open seven days a week and has linked several local grocers together to provide different food products. The market&#x27;s central location in downtown Los Angeles provides the perfect interaction for a diverse group of sellers to access their consumers.

==Benefits==
The benefits of UA for cities that implement this practice are numerous. Cities&#x27; transformation from food consumers to generators of agricultural products contributes to sustainability, improved health, and poverty alleviation.

* UA creates circular energy loops in which food is consumed in the same place it is produced, and waste is not exported to the peripheral rural areas.
* Wastewater and organic solid waste can be transformed into resources for growing agriculture products: the former can be used for irrigation, the latter as fertilizer.
* Vacant urban areas can be used for agriculture production instead of sitting unused
* Using wastewater for irrigation improves water management and increases the availability of fresh water for drinking and household consumption.
* UPA can help to preserve bioregional ecologies from being transformed into cropland.
* Urban agriculture saves energy (e.g., energy consumed in transporting food from rural to urban areas).
* Local food production also allows savings in transportation costs, storage, and product loss, which results in a reduction in food costs.
* UA improves the quality of the urban environment through greening and, thus, reduces pollution.
* Urban agriculture also makes the city a healthier place to live by improving the quality of the environment.
* UPA is a very effective tool for fighting hunger and malnutrition since it facilitates access to food for an impoverished sector of the urban population.
A large part of urban agriculture involves the urban poor. In developing countries, the majority of urban agricultural production is for self-consumption, with surpluses sold in the market. According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), poor urban consumers spend 60–80% of their income on food, making them vulnerable to higher food prices.
* UPA provides food and creates savings in household consumable expenditures, thus increasing the amount of income allocated to other uses.
* UPA surpluses can be sold in local markets, generating more income for the urban poor.

Community centers and gardens educate the community to see agriculture as an integral part of urban life. The Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development in Sarasota, Florida serves as a public community and education center where innovators with sustainable, energy-saving ideas can implement and test them. Community centers like Florida House integrate agriculture into the urban lifestyle by providing centralized urban areas to learn about urban agriculture and food production.

Urban farms also are a proven effective educational tool to teach kids about healthy eating and meaningful physical activity.

==Trade-offs==
* Space is at a premium in cities and is accordingly expensive and difficult to secure.
* The utilization of untreated wastewater for urban agricultural irrigation can facilitate the spread of waterborne diseases among the human population. 
* Although studies have demonstrated improved air quality in urban areas related to the proliferation of urban gardens, it has also been shown that increasing urban pollution (related specifically to a sharp rise in the number of automobiles on the road), has led to an increase in insect pests, which consume plants produced by urban agriculture. It is believed that changes to the physical structure of the plants themselves, which have been correlated to increased levels of air pollution, increase plants&#x27; palatability to insect pests. Reduced yields within urban gardens decreases the amount of food available for human consumption. 
* Studies indicate that the nutritional quality of wheat suffers when urban wheat plants are exposed to high nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide concentrations. This problem is particularly acute in the developing world, where outdoor concentrations of sulfur dioxide are high and large percentages of the population rely upon urban agriculture as a primary source of food. These studies have implications for the nutritional quality of other staple crops that are grown in urban settings.
* Agricultural activities on land that is contaminated (with such metals as lead) pose potential risks to human health. These risks are associated both with working directly on contaminated land and with consuming food that was grown in contaminated soil.

Municipal greening policy goals can pose conflicts. For example, policies promoting urban tree canopy are not sympathetic to vegetable gardening because of the deep shade cast by trees. However, some municipalities like Portland, Oregon, and Davenport, Iowa are encouraging the implementation of fruit-bearing trees (as street trees or as park orchards) to meet both greening and food production goals.

<text>Hirth Engines GmbH is an engine manufacturer based in Benningen, Germany. It is currently a part of the UMS Aero Group. Hirth began manufacturing aero engines in the 1920s, was taken over by Heinkel in WWII to develop the Heinkel-Hirth jet engines, and today specialises in small two-stroke engines for light aircraft and other applications.

==History==
===Hellmuth Hirth and Hirth Motoren ===
The company was founded by Hellmuth Hirth as Versuchsbau Hellmuth Hirth. The first commercial engine, the 4-cylinder inverted in-line HM 60, first ran in June 1923 and was sold from the next year. Its quality was extremely high and it formed the foundation of the business.

The company was renamed Leichtmetall-Werke GmbH, Elektronmetall GmbH and eventually separated from the aero engine manufacturing to form Mahle GmbH as a manufacturer of light alloy engine components, specifically the magnesium alloy Elektron, including parts for aircraft engines.

In 1931, Hirth renamed the much-expanded aero engine business as Hirth Motoren GmbH. An upgrade in the form of the HM 60R improved efficiency, and was followed by 6, 8 and 12-cylinder versions based on the same basic design. Over the next decade, Hirth became one of Germany&#x27;s leading aero engine manufacturers.

===Heinkel-Hirth===
During the late 1930s Hans von Ohain developed a jet engine design while at Göttingen University. Despite having no engine facility, aircraft designer Heinkel employed him to continue his work. Together with Wilhelm Gundermann he developed a series of experimental engines, including the HeS 3B which powered the world&#x27;s first jet aircraft, the Heinkel He 178, in 1939.

Hellmuth Hirth died in an aircraft crash in 1938. The RLM or &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (&quot;Reich aviation ministry&quot;) nationalised his company, and in 1942 it was taken over by Heinkel to form Heinkel-Hirth. While the existing piston engine series were continued, Heinkel also used the Hirth facilities for development work on their series of jet engines. Although Heinkel-Hirth had some technical success with this programme, their jet engines were not put into production.

===Gobler-Hirth and UMS Skeldar===
Following World War II, Hirth re-emerged as an independent company once again. Because of the prohibitions on German aviation in this period, Hirth manufactured small marine and stationary engines, as well as motors for snowmobiles. In the early 1970s the company went into voluntary liquidation. 

The company was acquired by Hans Göbler, who continued making small two-stroke engines under the name of Gobler-Hirth Motoren Gmbh, and re-introduced aero engines to the range. In 2011 Gobler-Hirth were developing UAV piston engines to run on heavier jet fuel, because of its higher energy density and ease of handling.

In 2018 Gobler-Hirth was taken over by UMS Skeldar, a joint venture between the Swedish aerospace company Saab AB and Swiss drone maker UMS Aero Group in which UMS hold a majority share. The company was renamed Hirth Engines Gmbh. The Skeldar range of UAVs, originally developed by Saab, have introduced Hirth&#x27;s heavy-fuel piston engines to the marketplace, alongside their established gasoline-fuelled products.

<doc id="450263" wikidata="Q251621" url="?curid=450263" title="Kau Sai Chau">
<text>Kau Sai Chau is an island located off the coast of Sai Kung Peninsula, Hong Kong, with an area of 6.70 km2, making it the 6th largest island of Hong Kong. It is under the administration of Sai Kung District.

The island was formerly known as Keui Island. &#x27;Kau Sai Chau&#x27;, the transliteration of the Chinese name through the Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation system, was later adopted as its English name.

==Geography==
Kau Sai Chau is located south of the Sai Kung Peninsula. Its northern shore forms part of the southern limit of Port Shelter Sheltered Water, of which it is the largest island. Kau Sai Chau is connected in the north by a breakwater to the smaller island Yim Tin Tsai. The southern tip of the island is separated by a narrow channel from Jin Island. It has a maximum elevation of 216 m.

Kau Sai Fishermen Village is a small fishing hamlet with about ten houses. It is located at the southern tip of the island.

==History==
At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Kau Sai Chau was 39. The number of males was 29.

In 1952, Hakka farmers and shopkeepers of Kau Sai Chau were required to relocate, because the place was located in the centre of a large area of sea about to be designated as a military firing range. The villagers were resited to Kau Sai San Tsuen, off Hiram&#x27;s Highway at Pak Sha Wan.

==Culture==
Two declared monuments of Hong Kong are located on Kau Sai Chau: a prehistoric rock carving and a Hung Shing Temple.

The prehistoric rock carving was discovered in 1976. It is located on the north-western coast of the island, in a location &quot;where accessibility by land is extremely poor&quot;.

The Hung Shing Temple is located in the southern part of the island, near Kau Sai Fishermen Village, of which it is the only temple. The building was built before 1889. It is constructed in grey bricks with a timber roof frame. The temple has been renovated four times, in 1949, in the 1970s, in 1988 and the last being from August 1999 to February 2000. The restoration was declared an &quot;Outstanding Project&quot; by the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage 2000 Awards. Previously a Grade III Historic Building, the temple was declared a monument on 15 November 2002.

The Hung Shing Festival () is celebrated there every year on the 12th and the 13th days of the second lunar month in Chinese calendar. An opera troupe is hired to perform Cantonese operas to thank the deities. The Jiao Festival is conducted on the day before the festival.

==Leisure amenities==
The Jockey Club Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course, developed and run by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, is the only public golf course in Hong Kong. Opened in 1995, it occupies approximately the northern half of the island. It comprises three 18-hole golf courses: the North and South Courses were designed by Gary Player, while Nelson &amp; Haworth designed the East Course.

There are wild boars wandering the island. They come out typically at night and may cause serious damage to the golf course.

==Transportation==
A scheduled ferry service connects Sai Kung Town and the ferry pier of the Public Golf Course. The Hong Kong Jockey Club runs three Solar Sailor ferries to the island per hour. 

Other parts of the island may be reached by privately owned boats from Sai Kung Pier.

<text>Matthew Owen John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Goss Moor (born 3 January 1963) is a British politician who has been a life peer in the House of Lords since 2010. A member of the Liberal Democrats, he previously served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Truro and St Austell (Truro, 1987–1997) in Cornwall from 1987 until he stood down at the 2010 general election. He was granted a life peerage and so became a member of the House of Lords on 16 July 2010.

Since 2007, Taylor has worked at a national level with successive governments on reforming national planning policy to support more sustainable forms of development and improved community engagement in placemaking. He is best known for his work in support of rural communities including developing neighbourhood planning policy, as well as creating the Government&#x27;s &quot;Garden Communities&quot; policies for 21st-century sustainable new communities and neighbourhoods.

==Early life==
Matthew Taylor is the adopted son of Kenneth Taylor, a television script writer best known for several of the BBC&#x27;s classic drama series, including a number of Jane Austen adaptions, as well as ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot; and Channel Four&#x27;s &quot;The Camomile Lawn.&quot;

In 2008, he traced his birth mother Margaret Harris, daughter of New Zealand businessman Sir Jack Harris, and learnt that his great-grandfather had been another Liberal MP, Sir Percy Harris who served as Liberal Chief Whip from 1935 to 1945, and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party from 1940 to 1945.

==Education==
Taylor was educated first at St Paul&#x27;s Primary School in Truro and then two independent schools: Treliske Preparatory School (now known as Truro School Prep) on Highertown (A390) in Truro, and University College School in Hampstead, north London, followed by winning a scholarship to Lady Margaret Hall at the University of Oxford where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.

==Life and career==
Politically active from a young age, Taylor campaigned for Liberal Party Deputy Leader and North Cornwall MP John Pardoe in the 1979 United Kingdom general election at the age of sixteen and joined the Cornwall anti-nuclear alliance a year later to campaign against a nuclear power station proposed to be built in the County. He involved himself in environmental and civil liberties campaigns whilst at sixth form. After winning a scholarship, he studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. At the end of his degree, he was elected as President of the Oxford University Student Union for the year 1985–86 on the Liberal/SDP Alliance ticket.

==Member of Parliament==

In 1986 he was employed by the Parliamentary Liberal Party as their Economic Policy Researcher and assigned to the then Truro MP David Penhaligon who was the Liberal Party&#x27;s Treasury Spokesman and Deputy Leader. Penhaligon died in a car crash at the end of that year; Taylor was selected to run as the Liberal candidate in the subsequent by-election, which he won in early 1987. Three months later he retained the seat at the 1987 general election. Aged 24, he was the youngest sitting MP and took the title &quot;Baby of the House&quot; from fellow Alliance MP Charles Kennedy, holding the title for 10 years until 1997.

After the break-up of the SDP Liberal Alliance in 1987-8 and the new &#x27;Social and Liberal Democratic Party&#x27; coming behind the Greens in the 1989 European Elections, Taylor was asked by the new Leader Paddy Ashdown to take on the leadership of Party Communications and relaunch and rebrand the Party. In the role &#x27;Chairman of Communications&#x27; (1989–92) he put together and led a small group of outside experts to create the new Liberal Democrats brand and branding, including the new name and the Bird of Liberty logo. Taylor&#x27;s role was expanded to a new role of &#x27;Chairman of Campaigns and Communications&#x27; (1992–94).
From 1990 to 1994 Taylor was also the Party&#x27;s Education Spokesman, authoring the Liberal Democrats&#x27; best-known policy position at that time, to commit to increase basic rate Income Tax for Education. He then moved to be Environment spokesman 1994-7, committing the party to a switch to environment taxes (specifically a carbon tax) mitigated by a cut in VAT. In this role he won the Green Magazine award for &#x27;Most effective environmental MP&#x27; in 1996.

Taylor was Campaign Chairman to Charles Kennedy and with his leadership campaign in 1999 after Ashdown stepped down. He was to be made the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson (1999–2003) by Kennedy, and announced the policy of raising the upper rate to 50% for people earning over £100,000. He was asked to lead the preparation of the 2001 General Election manifesto, which he co-authored with Professor Richard Grayson who was then Charles Kennedy&#x27;s Director of Policy.

After being replaced in the Treasury role by Vince Cable MP in 2003, Taylor became Party Chairman. In this role he returned formally to his leading role in Party Campaigns and Communications, with responsibility for oversight of both the Parliamentary Party&#x27;s Communications team and its Policy team, and was again tasked with writing the 2005 General Election manifesto. He was one of a small number of people in the immediate leadership team aware of and attempting to get Kennedy to address his increasing problems with alcohol, eventually giving Kennedy an ultimatum in the approach to the 2005 General Election that if he failed to address the issue he would have to stand down as leader.

After the 2005 election he re-stood for chair of the Liberal Democrats (a role elected by Liberal Democrat MPs) but lost to Paul Holmes by 36 votes to 23. According to a biography of Charles Kennedy, Holmes was seen as a &quot;shop steward&quot; of the backbenches, whereas Taylor was within the leader&#x27;s inner circle.

==Career after House of Commons==
In 2006 Taylor stood for the Deputy Leadership role in the Liberal Democrats and was defeated by Vince Cable by one vote. In 2007, he was approached by the new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown to conduct a Rural Economy Review. Taylor negotiated to extend the review to include housing, and to focus it on planning policy reforms. He published this Government Review as &quot;Living Working Countryside&#x27; in summer 2008.

Taylor did not seek re-election to parliament in the 2010 General Election. After the 2010 General Election Taylor was appointed a life peerage in the 2010 Dissolution Honours and his title was gazetted as Baron Taylor of Goss Moor, of Truro in the County of Cornwall on 16 July 2010 and sits as a Liberal Democrat peer in the House of Lords.

In 2011–12 he was then asked by Planning Minister Greg Barker and his successor Nick Boles to lead the Government&#x27;s review of all the planning practice guidance sitting and created a new National Planning Practice Guidance suite. In 2015 he developed his &#x27;Garden Village&#x27; proposal, published by Policy Exchange, for enabling local authorities to support new sustainable mixed use communities to meet housing need.

Taylor was chair of the National Housing Federation from 2010 to 2016. He was also elected President of the National Association of Local Councils 2016–18 (representing England&#x27;s Town and Parish Councils). Taylor has been made an Honorary Member of the RTPI, Visiting Professor of Planning at Plymouth University, and Senior Visiting Fellow at Cambridge University&#x27;s School of Planning

Taylor was a Non-Executive Director of South West Water from 2010 to 2020. He is also Chairman of Kensa Group, a manufacturer and installer of Ground Sourced Heating systems.

==Personal life==
Taylor married Vicky Garner, a former director of pressure group Surfers Against Sewage, in 2007. The couple have three sons. They divorced in 2017.

<doc id="450268" wikidata="Q1961308" url="?curid=450268" title="Stationary engine">
<text>A stationary engine is an engine whose framework does not move. They are used to drive immobile equipment, such as pumps, generators, mills or factory machinery, or cable cars. The term usually refers to large immobile reciprocating engines, principally stationary steam engines and, to some extent, stationary internal combustion engines. Other large immobile power sources, such as steam turbines, gas turbines, and large electric motors, are categorized separately.

Stationary engines, especially stationary steam engines were once widespread in the late Industrial Revolution. This was an era when each factory or mill generated its own power, and power transmission was mechanical (via line shafts, belts, gear trains, and clutches). Applications for stationary engines have declined since electrification has become widespread; most industrial uses today draw electricity from an electrical grid and distribute it to various individual electric motors instead.

Engines that operate in one place, but can be moved to another place for later operation, are called portable engines. Although stationary engines and portable engines are both &quot;&quot; (not moving) while running, preferred usage (for clarity&#x27;s sake) reserves the term &quot;stationary engine&quot; to the permanently immobile type, and &quot;portable engine&quot; to the mobile type.

== Types of stationary engine ==
There are many types of stationary engines. These include:
* Stationary steam engine
* Hit and miss engine
* Hot bulb engine
* Hot tube engine

== Applications ==
Stationary engines had a wide range of applications but they were especially used by small companies and operations, requiring power in limited settings at specific sites.
=== Lead, tin, and copper mines===
===Cotton, woollen, and worsted mills===
===Flour mills and corn grinders===
A flat belt could be used to connect an engine to a flour mill or corn grinder. These machines are popular at old engine shows. Corn grinders would take corn off the cob, and grind up corn into animal feed. flour mills make flour.
=== Electricity generation ===

Before mains electricity and the formation of nationwide power grids, stationary engines were widely used for small-scale electricity generation. While large power stations in cities used steam turbines or high-speed reciprocating steam engines, in rural areas petrol/gasoline, paraffin/kerosene, and fuel oil-powered internal combustion engines were cheaper to buy, install, and operate, since they could be started and stopped quickly to meet demand, left running unattended for long periods of time, and did not require a large dedicated engineering staff to operate and maintain. Due to their simplicity and economy, hot bulb engines were popular for high-power applications until the diesel engine took their place from the 1920s. Smaller units were generally powered by spark-ignition engines, which were cheaper to buy and required less space to install.

Most engines of the late-19th and early-20th centuries ran at speeds too low to drive a dynamo or alternator directly. As with other equipment, the generator was driven off the engine&#x27;s flywheel by a broad flat belt. The pulley on the generator was much smaller than the flywheel, providing the required &#x27;gearing up&#x27; effect. Later spark-ignition engines developed from the 1920s could be directly coupled.

Up to the 1930s most rural houses in Europe and North America needed their own generating equipment if electric light was fitted. Engines would often be installed in a dedicated &quot;engine house&quot;, which was usually an outbuilding separate from the main house to reduce the interference from the engine noise. The engine house would contain the engine, the generator, the necessary switchgear and fuses, as well as the engine&#x27;s fuel supply and usually a dedicated workshop space with equipment to service and repair the engine. Wealthy households could afford to employ a dedicated engineer to maintain the equipment, but as the demand for electricity spread to smaller homes, manufacturers produced engines that required less maintenance and that did not need specialist training to operate.

Such generator sets were also used in industrial complexes and public buildings – anywhere where electricity was required but mains electricity was not available.

Most countries in the Western world completed large-scale rural electrification in the years following World War II, making individual generating plants obsolete for front-line use. However, even in countries with a reliable mains supply, many buildings are still fitted with modern diesel generators for emergency use, such as hospitals and pumping stations. This network of generators often forms a crucial part of the national electricity system&#x27;s strategy for coping with periods of high demand.

=== Pumping stations ===

The development of water supply and sewage removal systems required the provision of many pumping stations. In these, some form of stationary engine (steam-powered for earlier installations) is used to drive one or more pumps, although electric motors are more conventionally used nowadays.

===Canals===
For canals, a distinct area of application concerned the powering of boat lifts and inclined planes. Where possible these would be arranged to utilise water and gravity in a balanced system, but in some cases additional power input was required from a stationary engine for the system to work. The vast majority of these were constructed (and in many cases, demolished again) before steam engines were supplanted by internal combustion alternatives.

===Cable haulage railways===
Industrial railways in quarries and mines made use of cable railways based on the inclined plane idea, and certain early passenger railways in the UK were planned with lengths of cable-haulage to overcome severe gradients.

For the first proper railway, the Liverpool and Manchester of 1830, it was not clear whether locomotive traction would work, and the railway was designed with steep 1 in 100 gradients concentrated on either side of Rainhill, just in case. Had cable haulage been necessary, then inconvenient and time-consuming shunting would have been required to attach and detach the cables. The Rainhill gradients proved not to be a problem, and in the event, locomotive traction was determined to be a new technology with great potential for further development.

The steeper 1 in 50 grades from Liverpool down to the docks were operated by cable traction for several decades until locomotives improved. Cable haulage continued to be used where gradients were even steeper.

Cable haulage did prove viable where the gradients were exceptionally steep, such as the 1 in 8 gradients of the Cromford and High Peak Railway opened in 1830. Cable railways generally have two tracks with loaded wagons on one track partially balanced by empty wagons on the other, to minimize fuel costs for the stationary engine. Various kinds of rack railways were developed to overcome the lack of friction of conventional locomotives on steep gradients.

These early installations of stationary engines would all have been steam-powered initially.

== Preserved stationary engines ==
Many steam rallies, like the Great Dorset Steam Fair, include an exhibit section for internal combustion stationary engines for which purpose the definition is usually extended to include any engine that was not intended primarily for the propulsion of a vehicle. Thus many are in fact portable engines, either from new or having been converted by mounting on a wheeled trolley for ease of transport and may also include such things as marine or airborne auxiliary power units and engines removed from equipment such as motor mowers. These engines have been restored by private individuals and often are exhibited in operation, powering water pumps, electric generators, hand tools, and the like.

In the UK there are few museums where visitors can see stationary engines in operation. Many museums have one or more engines but only a few specialise in the internal combustion stationary engines. Among these are the Internal Fire Museum of Power, in Wales, and the Anson Engine Museum in Cheshire. The Amberley Working Museum in West Sussex also has a number of engines, as does Kew Bridge Steam Museum in London.

<doc id="450270" wikidata="Q272452" url="?curid=450270" title="Gareth Thomas (English politician)">
<text>Gareth Richard Thomas (born 15 July 1967) is a British Labour politician who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Harrow West since 1997. He has served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Services, Small Business and Exports since July 2024. Thomas served as Minister of State for International Development and Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Consumer Affairs between 2008 and 2010. He was the Chair of the Co-operative Party from 2001 until 2019, and stands for election as a Labour and Co-operative candidate.

==Early life and education==
Thomas spent his childhood in the London Borough of Harrow, attending Hatch End High School and later Lowlands College. He gained a Bachelor of Science (BsC) degree in economics from Aberystwyth University, graduating in 1988. He later undertook a PGCE at Thames Polytechnic to become a teacher, which he completed in 1992. In 1996, he studied for a Master of Arts (MA) degree in Imperial and Commonwealth Studies at King&#x27;s College London.

==Parliamentary career==
Thomas was first elected to represent Harrow West at the 1997 general election when he defeated the incumbent Conservative, Robert Hughes, with a majority of 1,240 votes. 

He was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for International Development in 2003.

The same year, Thomas made an early attempt to ban smoking in restaurants via a Private Members&#x27; Bill.

After a June 2007 reshuffle, Thomas remained at International Development whilst also being part of the new Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, being appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade Policy and Consumer Affairs. He had the responsibility of co-ordinating trade policy between the two departments.

Following Gordon Brown&#x27;s reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Thomas was promoted to Minister of State in both departments, taking on the portfolio of Trade, Investment and Consumer Affairs. In the June 2009 reshuffle DBERR was abolished, leaving Thomas to continue his role solely at International Development, with responsibility for consumer affairs passing to Kevin Brennan.
In May 2010 he was re-elected as Member of Parliament for Harrow West with a reduced majority (based on a notional 2005 result). He was Shadow Minister for Higher Education and Science from October 2010 to October 2011, Shadow Minister for Civil Society from October 2011 to October 2013, Shadow Minister for Europe from March 2013 to October 2014, then Shadow Minister for Africa and the Middle East from October 2014 to March 2015.

At the 2015 general election the Conservative Party candidate Hannah David produced a significant swing from Labour to the Conservatives, reducing his majority to 2,208. Thomas received his worst general election result to date at the 2015 election.

In the 2016 European Union referendum, Thomas campaigned for the UK to remain a member of the European Union (EU) and has consistently supported the United Kingdom&#x27;s membership of the EU.

Thomas supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election. After Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s re-election as Labour leader, Thomas was one of the first Labour MPs to return to the frontbench, as Shadow Minister for Local Government until June 2017.

In 2017, he voted against the bill permitting the government to start negotiations on withdrawal from the EU by sending an article 50 notice to the EU; in doing so he broke the party whip.

In the 2017 and 2019 general elections, Thomas was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Harrow West with majorities of 13,314 and 8,692 respectively.

Thomas organised Harrow&#x27;s first university fair at Whitmore High School in 2016, allowing students to engage with leading universities within the UK and abroad. The event has been held annually since, and due to its success an additional careers fair was arranged for late 2020.

In 2020, Thomas said the next Labour leader &quot;should confirm they will not support nationalising the water and energy industries&quot;, claiming that voters were put off voting Labour because they did not believe these pledges were deliverable alongside calls for nationalisation of the railways and Royal Mail, which Thomas supports.

Thomas supported Emily Thornberry in the 2020 Labour leadership contest. 

He has served on the Official Opposition frontbench as Shadow Minister for International Trade since April 2020.

Thomas is a member of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East and a founder member of Labour Friends of India.

2024 General Election

Thomas retained his seat with a majority of 6,642 in the 2024 General Election whereupon was appointed the government role of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Business and Trade

== 2016 London mayoral bid ==
In 2015, Thomas sought to become the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate in the 2016 election for Mayor of London, receiving sufficient nominations to make it to the final six nominees for the party&#x27;s mayoral candidate. He finished in last place on the party&#x27;s final ballot, with Sadiq Khan becoming Labour&#x27;s mayoral candidate.

<text>Gareth Thomas (born 25 September 1954) is a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was Member of Parliament for Clwyd West from 1997 to 2005.

==Early life==
Born in Penygroes, Gwynedd, Thomas is the son of a toolmaker. Although brought up on Merseyside, he is a fluent Welsh language speaker. He went to Rock Ferry High School on Ravenswood Avenue in Rock Ferry, Birkenhead.

After graduating in law (LLB) from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1976, he was initially employed in the insurance industry and managed a loss adjusting company in the West Indies. He graduated from the Council of Legal Education (CLE) in 1977. Thomas has been a barrister in a private practice since 1986 specialising in personal injury litigation and is a member of Amicus.

==Parliamentary career==
A member of Flintshire County Council between 1995 and 1997, Thomas was elected to Parliament at the 1997 general election. Before 1997, Clwyd West had been regarded as a safe Conservative seat. His political interests include Wales, legal reform, social security and the environment. He was a member of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, the Select Committee on Social Security and the Joint Human Rights Committee.

He unsuccessfully sought the nomination for Clwyd West seat in the inaugural Assembly elections losing out to Alun Pugh.

Following the 2001 general election he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Wales, Paul Murphy, and in October 2002 moved with Murphy to the Northern Ireland Office in the same capacity. He was a member of Labour&#x27;s Parliamentary Campaign Team.

At the 2005 general election, Thomas was narrowly defeated by the Conservative Party candidate David Jones.

Thomas has returned to the legal profession, working as a barrister at Atlantic Chambers Liverpool. In 2013 he was chosen as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for Clwyd West at the 2015 general election. However, he was again defeated by Jones, this time by 6,730 votes. He stood again for his old seat at the 2017 election, cutting Jones&#x27; majority to 3,437 votes, and achieving a swing of 5% in the process.

==Personal life==
Outside politics, Thomas&#x27;s interests include restoring old buildings, traditional rural crafts and Italy. He continues to live in his former constituency, near Ruthin. He is married to Joanne, and between them they have four children, including his youngest son, Howell Thomas. His wife contested his former seat at the 2019 general election.

<text>Sir Stephen Creswell Timms (born 29 July 1955) is a British Labour Party politician who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for East Ham, formerly Newham North East, since 1994. He has served as Minister of State for Social Security and Disability since July 2024. 

Timms served in the New Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown under several portfolios. He served for three periods as Financial Secretary to the Treasury; from 1999 to 2001, 2004 to 2005 and 2008 to 2010. As Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Timms attended Cabinet from 2006 to 2007.

In May 2010, Timms survived an attempted murder by Islamist terrorist Roshonara Choudhry who stabbed him twice in the abdomen at his constituency surgery. Choudhry was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Timms served on the Official Opposition frontbench as Shadow Minister for Employment and later served in the Shadow cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. He returned to the backbenches in September 2015.

==Early life and career==
Stephen Timms was born on 29 July 1955 in Oldham, Lancashire, to Ronald James Timms, an engineer, and Margaret Joyce Timms, a teacher. He was educated at Farnborough Grammar School in Farnborough, Hampshire, before studying mathematics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he gained a degree in mathematics in 1977 and an MPhil in operational research in 1978.

Before entering politics, Timms worked in the telecommunications industry for 15 years, first for Logica from 1978 to 1986, and then for Ovum from 1986 to 1994, where he worked as a manager responsible for producing reports on the future of telecommunications. He was elected as a councillor for the Little Ilford Ward on Newham London Borough Council in a by-election in 1984, and served as Leader of the Council from 1990 to 1994.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1994 Newham North East by-election, Timms was elected to Parliament as MP for Newham North East with 75% of the vote and a majority of 11,838.

Prior to the 1997 general election, Timms&#x27; constituency of Newham North East was abolished, and replaced with East Ham. At the election, Timms was elected to Parliament as MP for East Ham with 64.6% of the vote and a majority of 19,358.

Timms served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Andrew Smith from May 1997 to March 1998, and later to Mo Mowlam from March to July 1998.

In 1998, Timms was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security, rising to Minister of State in that department in 1999.

At the 2001 general election, Timms was re-elected as MP for East Ham with an increased vote share of 73.1% and an increased majority of 21,032. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 53.9% and a decreased majority of 13,155.

In May 2006, Timms was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, a post in which he remained until 28 June 2007, when he was removed from the cabinet by new prime minister Gordon Brown. It was later announced that he had been appointed Minister of State for Competitiveness at the newly created Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.

Following the government reshuffle on 24 January 2008, Timms moved to the Department for Work and Pensions, and became Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform. On 3 October 2008, Timms returned to his former role as Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

In August 2009, Timms was given additional responsibility for Digital Britain. In September 2009, he announced plans for a tax of £6 per year to be levied on each phone account in the UK. At the time, this was characterised as a stealth tax in the media. In April 2010, Timms&#x27; department made an embarrassing slip when a letter purporting to be from him mistakenly identified IP address as &quot;intellectual property address&quot;. According to the accountants&#x27; magazine &quot;Accountancy Age&quot;, he was highly regarded by finance professionals despite such gaffes.

At the 2010 general election, Timms was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 70.4% and an increased majority of 27,826.

In February 2013 Timms abstained on the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013 he voted against the bill&#x27;s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

Timms was again re-elected at the 2015 general election with an increased vote share of 77.6% and an increased majority of 34,252.

Following the 2015 Labour leadership election, he was offered a junior shadow Treasury position by new leader Jeremy Corbyn but chose to turn it down and return to the backbenches.

Timms supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

At the snap 2017 general election, Timms was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 83.2% and an increased majority of 39,883. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 76.3% and a decreased majority of 33,176.

In April 2021, Timms praised the work of the controversial Jesus House Church on Twitter. His tweet came after an official apology from Labour leader Keir Starmer, who had admitted it had been a &quot;mistake&quot; to film a promotional video at the church when it had come to light that the pastor of the church, Agu Irukwu, had previously opposed same sex marriage and equality legislation. LGBT+ Labour said they were &quot;disappointed&quot; to see Timms&#x27; tweet so soon after Starmer&#x27;s apology, after Timms was criticised for supporting the &quot;anti-LGBTQ+&quot; church.

On 23 August 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson appointed Timms as the UK&#x27;s trade envoy to Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Timms was knighted in the 2022 Birthday Honours for political and public service.

At the 2024 general election, Timms was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 51.6% and a decreased majority of 12,863.

== Murder attempt ==
On 14 May 2010, Timms was approached by 21-year-old female Islamist extremist Roshonara Choudhry, during a constituency surgery at the Beckton Globe Library in Kingsford Way in Beckton. Choudhry stabbed Timms twice in the abdomen with a 15cm (6-inch) kitchen knife, before being disarmed. She stated that she had been influenced by watching sermons of Anwar al-Awlaki, a leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and that her attack was to punish Timms for voting for the Iraq War, and seek revenge for the Iraqi people.

He suffered &quot;potentially life-threatening&quot; wounds, including lacerations to his liver and a perforation to his stomach. Timms underwent emergency surgery at the Royal London Hospital, from which he was discharged on 19 May.

On 2 November 2010, Choudhry was found guilty of Timms&#x27; attempted murder. She was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 15 years. After the court case, Timms said he was not bitter, but that forgiveness was not possible because his attacker showed no remorse. He has since sought the banning of incendiary material on popular internet sites &quot;to protect other vulnerable young people from going down the same road.&quot; YouTube removed some videos of al-Awlaki within hours of the sentence.

Following the murder of David Amess, Timms said in parliament that he would like to meet Choudhry, so &quot;he can finally forgive her&quot;.

==Personal life==
Timms is an evangelical Christian. He is passionate about Christians entering politics and is a keen supporter of Just Love, a social justice movement working with Christian students. He has lived in the London Borough of Newham since 1979, and has been married to Hui-Leng Lim since 1986.

<text>Mark Wainwright Todd (born 29 December 1954) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Derbyshire from 1997 to 2010.

Todd became the Chairman of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in January 2014.

==Early life and career==
Todd&#x27;s grandfather Alfred Todd was a Conservative MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed from 1929 to 1935. His father, Matthew Todd, was a submariner in the Royal Navy, seeing action in WW2 and commanding the Submarine Escape Training Tank.

Todd attended Sherborne School in north Dorset and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, gaining a BA degree in history in 1976. He served for twelve years as a Cambridge City Councillor, spending three years as leader, from 1987 to 1990, and five years as deputy leader.

Todd was a managing director of the Longman publishing house from 1977 to 1996. In this company he worked from 1988 to 1992 in industry and public service management, from 1990 to 1992 at Carter Mill and in information technology from 1992 to 1994. A former non-executive director of consumer co-operative Cambridge &amp; District Co-operative Society, before its 1991 merger with Co-operative Retail Services, he is a member of the Co-operative Party.

==Parliamentary career==
Todd first contested the seat of South Derbyshire in 1992, before gaining the seat from the Conservative&#x27;s Edwina Currie in 1997. He steered the Co-operatives and Community Benefit Societies Act 2003 through Parliament as a private member&#x27;s bill.

<doc id="450281" wikidata="Q1018144" url="?curid=450281" title="Paarl">
<text>Paarl (; ; derived from &quot;parel&quot;, meaning &quot;pearl&quot; in Dutch) is a city with 294,457 inhabitants in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is the largest city in the Cape Winelands. Due to the growth of the Mbekweni township, it is now a de facto urban unit with Wellington. It is situated about northeast of Cape Town in the Western Cape Province and is known for its scenic environment and viticulture and fruit-growing heritage.

Khoekhoe was the original language of the Paarl area, spoken by the Khoi people who would later be forced to speak the language of Dutch colonists. Resistance through the language saw the heavy input of Khoi into the colonist&#x27;s Dutch language, this input was a major contributor to the modern Afrikaans we know today.

Paarl is the seat of the Drakenstein Local Municipality; although not part of the Cape Town metropolitan area, it falls within its economic catchment. Paarl is unusual among South African place-names, in being pronounced differently in English than in Afrikaans; likewise unusual about the town&#x27;s name is Afrikaners customary attachment to it, saying not &quot;in Paarl&quot;, but rather &quot;in die Paarl&quot;, or &quot;in die Pêrel&quot; (literally, &quot;in the Paarl&quot;).

Paarl gained additional international attention when, on 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela walked, with live international television coverage, out of Victor Verster Correctional Centre (now known as Drakenstein Correctional Centre) in Paarl ending his 27 years of imprisonment, and beginning a course to South Africa&#x27;s post-apartheid era and, notably, to multi-racial elections. Mandela spent three years in prison here living in a private house within the walls. Today, a bronze statue of Mandela stands outside the prison.

Paarl hosted three matches of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2003. The headquarters of Ceres Fruit Juices is located in the city, although its namesake and source of much of the fruit, Ceres Valley, lies around one hour&#x27;s drive to the northeast.

The district is particularly well known for its Pearl Mountain or &quot;Paarl Rock&quot;. This huge granite rock consists of three rounded outcrops. Paarl Rock consists of intrusive igneous rock.

== History ==
The area that is now known as Paarl was first and is still inhabited by the Khoikhoi. The Peninsular Khoikhoi people and the Cocoqua people live in this area divided by the Berg River Valley. The Cocoqua were cattle-herding people and among the richest of the Khoi tribes. They had between 16,000 and 18,000 members and originally called Paarl Mountain, &quot;!hom ǃnāb/s&quot; which means Tortoise Mountain.

The Dutch East India Company, under the leadership of Jan van Riebeeck, established meat-trading relationships with the Khoikhoi people on the Table Bay coastline. In 1657, in search of new trading relationships inland, Abraham Gabemma saw a giant granite rock glistening in the sun after a rainstorm and named it &quot;de Diamondt en de Peerlberg&quot; (Diamond and Pearl Mountain), from which Paarl is derived. Gabemma (often also spelt Gabbema) was the Fiscal (public treasurer) for the settlement on the shores of Table Bay. The &quot;diamonds&quot; disappeared from the name, and it became known simply as Pearl Rock or Pearl Mountain.

In 1687, Governor Simon van der Stel gave the title to the first colonial farms in the area to &quot;free burghers&quot;. The following year, the French Huguenots arrived in the Western Cape and began to settle on farms in the area. The fertile soil and the Mediterranean-like climate of this region provided perfect conditions for farming. The settlers planted orchards, vegetable gardens and, above all, vineyards. Thus began Paarl&#x27;s long and continuing history as a major wine- and fruit-producing area of South Africa.

In 1875 a congregation was formed out of a desire to be educated in their mother tongue. This was the result of a Reverend GWA van der Lingen idea who tried to motivate and convince people of his principles. The congregation would raise funds and begin construction of a church that would later be known as the &quot;Toring Kerk&quot; (Tower Church). Construction finished in 1905. The church contains materials imported from London and Egypt.

The arrival of the European settlers brought on a conflict with the Khoikhoi people, as land and water resources began to be contested and the Khoi traditions of communal land use came in conflict with the settler&#x27;s concept of private property. The Khoi peoples were defeated in local war and were further decimated by European diseases. The population scattered inland toward the Orange River or became labourers on settler farms.

==Demographics==
In the 2001 census Paarl&#x27;s population was recorded as being 82,713 people in 20,138 households, in a land area of . A total of 67.8% of the inhabitants described themselves as &quot;Coloured&quot;, 21.2% as &quot;White&quot;, 10.5% as &quot;Black African&quot;, and 0.5% as &quot;Indian or Asian&quot;. Regarding language, 85.6% spoke Afrikaans as their first language, 8.5% spoke Xhosa, and 5.2% spoke English.
== Main sights ==

Like many towns in the Cape Winelands, Paarl is home to many Cape Dutch houses, gardens and streets lined with old oak trees.

Paarl was the place where the foundations of the Afrikaans language were laid by the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners. The &quot;Afrikaanse Taalmonument&quot; (monument to the Afrikaans language) on the slopes of Paarl Mountain, the Language Museum (Taalmuseum) and the Afrikaans Language Route through Dal Josaphat are memorials to this achievement.

The former headquarters of the wine industry in South Africa is also situated here. This was the &quot;Co-operative Wine Growers&#x27; Association&quot; (better known by its Afrikaans initials KWV). KWV became a South African institution that has acquired an international reputation based on its unique achievements and its imprint of quality on the local wine industry. Over the past decade, however, KWV has been privatized and no longer has an administrative role in the South African wine industry. (KWV&#x27;s main wine production and maturation facilities are on its Paarl premises, while its brandy production takes place in Worcester and grape juice concentrate production in Upington in the Northern Cape.)

Sights include Cape Dutch buildings (17-19th Century), scenic drives, hiking trails, excellent restaurants and the Paarl wine route, with its many wine tasting opportunities.

The old Spice Route Paarl, which was initiated in 1997 by Charles Back, the owner of this estate as well as of Fairview, provides an opportunity for visitors to appreciate and taste local delicacies from the Western Cape. In addition to that, a range of art galleries and the traditional way of organic dark chocolate production can be explored. The heritage of the Spice Route farm goes back to the historical mariners who used to trade Eastern spices to Europe along the &quot;Spice Route&quot; for spice trade in the 15th century.

The Paarl Rock itself is these days a common destination for rock climbers. However, in the pioneering period of rock climbing in South Africa, the mountain was ignored or shunned because its steep faces were so smooth and unfissured that climbers could find no place to attach &quot;runners&quot; or anchor points for belays. The first climbing routes up the rock were pioneered in 1969 by J. W. Marchant and G. Athiros, the former from the University of Cape Town Mountain and Ski Club. Soon afterwards Marchant and John Knight established a few routes on which the rope was run out for or more with no protection whatsoever. This was in the days before bolting was possible, and these achievements are still held in high regard today. Nowadays protection is afforded by bolts in the granite, and there are on Paarl Rock a few dozen routes that attract the best climbers of the current generation. (All of these climbs remain dangerous for the inexperienced.)

==Districts==

Amongst the neighbourhoods are De Zoete Inval (a middle-class suburb in the south); Courtrai (a wealthy suburb in the southern part of town); Central Paarl (generally known as Upper-Paarl and also containing a lot of wealthy suburbs); Lemoenkloof (a wealthy suburb between the central and northern parts of town); Northern Paarl (middle-class suburb, including the area of Groenvlei); Denneburg (a middle class suburb) as well as Klein Parys (both in the south-east of the town); Vrykyk (in the south), Charleston Hill (east of the Railway line) and areas in the eastern part of the town such as New Orleans, New York, Amstelhof, Lantana and Klein Nederburg.

There are also large gated communities developed towards the South of the town on the way to Franschhoek, such as Boschenmeer (golf estate), Val de Vie Estate (polo estate) and Pearl Valley (golf estate).

==Education==

The town boasts some of the best known governmental academic high schools in the country including Paarl Gimnasium High School, La Rochelle Girls&#x27; High School, Paarl Boys&#x27; High School, Paarl Girls’ High School, Boland Agricultural High, Paulus Joubert High, Noorder Paarl High School, New Orleans Secondary and Klein Nederburg Secondary. Paarl Girls&#x27; High was placed 17th in the National Senior Certificate&#x27;s &quot;Excellence in academic performance&quot; awards in 2012. New Orleans Secondary is the school where the Miss South Africa (2018), Tamaryn Green, completed her secondary education. Independent schools such as Simond Private School (est. 1852) and Bridge House also feature in this region. Bridge House, listed as one of the most expensive independent schools in South Africa, offers boarding facilities. These schools offer the IEB examinations as distinct from the National Senior Certificate offered by government schools. In August Paarl Gimnasium High School won the Motsepe Kay League Tournament and become one of the two Schools to represent South Africa in Singapore where they took first position and won Gold. The other School from Petsana,Reitz in the Free State came third and won a bronze medal.

==Climate==

== Transport ==
The N1 national highway is the main freeway intersecting Paarl, running south of the city from the city of Cape Town in the south-west to Worcester and further onwards to Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and Pretoria in the north-east intersecting four on and off-ramp interchanges within Paarl including the R45 Main Road (Exit 55), Cecilia Street (Exit 57), R301 Jan van Riebeeck Drive (Exit 59) and Sonstraal Road (Exit 62) interchanges.

As a regional hub, Paarl is located at the centre of three regional routes including the R45 (Main Road) which runs from Franschhoek and Villiersdorp in the south-west to Malmesbury and Vredenburg in the Cape West Coast which is to the north-west. The R101 (Main Road; Market Street; Langenhoven Avenue) runs from Klapmuts and Kraaifontein in the south-west, passing through Paarl and climbing over the Du Toitskloof Mountains as Du Toitskloof Pass to join the N1 to Worcester. The R101 was the original N1 and served the same function before the construction of the highway. The R301 (Jan van Riebeeck Drive) runs from Franschhoek (via the R45) in the south-west to Mbekweni and Wellington in the north and over the Bainskloof Pass to Ceres in the north-west (via the R43).

==Coats of arms==
Municipality (1) — On 18 July 1905, the municipal council accepted a coat of arms presented by . It was the arms of Hendrik van Reede van Drakenstein : a silver shield charged with two dancetty black bars and crowned with a golden coronet. The supporters were two golden gryphons. The motto was &quot;Pour le salut du peuple&quot; (&quot;For the wellbeing of the people&quot;). Sometimes, the arms were depicted as silver dancetty bars on a blue shield.
Municipality (2) — The arms were re-designed in 1950 by Colin Graham Botha, and granted by the College of Arms on 22 January 1951. They were published in the Cape Province&#x27;s &quot;Official Gazette&quot; in 1955, re-granted by the provincial administrator in 1967, and certified by the Bureau of Heraldry in 1969.

In the new version, each of the dancetty bars on the shield displayed two pearls; the supporters were red with blue wings dotted with golden fleurs de lis; and the crest was a red demi-gryphon with blue wings holding a bunch of grapes.

Divisional Council — The divisional council was the local authority which administered the rural areas outside the town. It registered a coat of arms at the Bureau of Heraldry on 20 October 1978. Once again, the Van Reede shield formed the basis of the design. Down the middle of the shield was a red pale displaying a bunch of grapes between two pearls. The crest was a fleur de lis. The motto was &quot;Animus et fata&quot; (&quot;Courage and fortune&quot;).

Mbekweni — The local authority for the predominantly Black township of Mbekweni, which borders with Wellington, registered arms at the Bureau on 5 May 1989. The shield is divided per chevron into red and green, with a golden chevron rompu across the centre and a silver cross pommy below it. Above the arms was a green mural crown decorated with a band of red edged in gold. The motto was &quot;uXolo neMpulelelo&quot;.

<doc id="450282" wikidata="Q334348" url="?curid=450282" title="Jenny Tonge, Baroness Tonge">
<text>Jennifer Louise Tonge, Baroness Tonge (&quot;née&quot; Smith; born 19 February 1941) is a politician in the United Kingdom. She was Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond Park in London from 1997 to 2005. In June 2005 she was made a life peer as Baroness Tonge, of Kew in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, which entitled her to a seat in the House of Lords.

Critical of Israel and vocal in support of the Palestinian cause, controversial acts and comments led to accusations of anti-Semitism and to her eventual suspension from the Liberal Democrats group in the Lords in 2012, then her suspension and resignation from the party itself in October 2016. She sat as an independent in the Lords from 2012 until her retirement in 2021.

==Early life==
Born in Walsall, Staffordshire, her parents were both schoolteachers. She attended Dudley Girls High School from 1951 to 1959. She trained to be a doctor at University College Hospital, gaining an MB and BS in 1964.

She is also MFFP (Membership of the Faculty of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care of the RCOG). She holds an honorary FFFP. From 1968–78, she worked in General Practice and Family Planning. From 1980 to 1985, she worked as Senior Medical Officer in Women&#x27;s Services in Ealing. She was a manager of Community Health Services in Ealing from 1992 to 1996.
Tonge was a councillor in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames from 1981 to 1990, and served as chair of the Social Services Committee. She stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Richmond and Barnes constituency at the 1992 general election. It was considered to be the party&#x27;s most winnable seat, but Tonge was not elected.

==Parliamentary career==
===Member of Parliament===
====Election and PMQs====
In 1997, Tonge was elected to Parliament, representing Richmond Park. While in the House of Commons, she was Liberal Democrat spokesperson on International Development from 1997 to 2003, and then the party spokesperson for children from 2003 to 2004.

In 2002, during the Emmanuel College creationism controversy, she asked Prime Minister Tony Blair if he was &quot;happy to allow the teaching of creationism alongside Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution in state schools&quot;. Blair replied that he supported a &quot;diverse school system&quot;, and praised the teachers at Emmanuel College for their commitments to &quot;deliver[ing] better results for our children&quot;. Tonge was concerned about Blair&#x27;s response, because it implied the government was &quot;prepared to accept money from anybody, regardless of the doctrine or religious beliefs of the donor&quot;.

====Visit to Gaza Strip (2003)====
In 2003, Tonge and Labour MP Oona King visited the Gaza Strip. At a subsequent press conference after their return, Tonge compared Gaza Strip living conditions for Palestinians to conditions Jews had suffered in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. Tonge said &quot;You are almost getting a situation like the Warsaw ghetto. People can&#x27;t get in or out. They can&#x27;t work, they can&#x27;t sell anything. There is this gradual squeeze&quot;, adding &quot;It was an apartheid system.&quot; Tonge recommended economic sanctions be applied against Israel and for European Union or United Nations troops be sent to Gaza. Tonge and King claimed that an Israeli soldier wielding a grenade had confronted them when they tried to leave the Gaza Strip.

Yad Vashem museum chair Avner Shalev criticized Tonge and King for making the comparison with conditions under Nazi rule.

====Palestinian suicide bombers (2004)====
In January 2004, Tonge was sacked as the Liberal Democrat children&#x27;s spokeswoman by the party leader, Charles Kennedy. At a pro-Palestinian parliamentary meeting, Tonge had said of Palestinian suicide bombers: &quot;If I had to live in that situation – and I say that advisedly – I might just consider becoming one myself&quot;. She repeated her comments on Sky News, but added, &quot;I do not condone suicide bombers, nobody can condone them&quot;. Tonge refused to apologise, commenting &quot;I was just trying to say how, having seen the violence and the humiliation and the provocation that the Palestinian people live under every day and have done since their land was occupied by Israel, I could understand&quot;.

Kennedy said her comments were &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; and &quot;not compatible with Liberal Democrat party policies and principles&quot;, adding &quot;there can be no justification, under any circumstances for taking innocent lives through terrorism&quot;. Tonge said that suicide bombers&#x27; actions are &quot;appalling and loathsome&quot; but that &quot;we have to try and understand where they are coming from and understand the situation in which they live.&quot;

Tonge retired from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election, and was made a life peer and member of the House of Lords later in the year.

===Life peer===

====Allegations about the Israel lobby (2006)====
Tonge remarked at a Liberal Democrat party conference fringe meeting in September 2006: &quot;The pro-Israeli lobby has got its grips on the western world, its financial grips. I think they&#x27;ve probably got a grip on our party&quot;.

In response, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell wrote to Tonge, commenting that her unacceptable assertion had &quot;clear anti-Semitic connotations&quot;. An all-party group of peers led by the former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, said, in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, that &quot;the language deployed by Baroness Tonge, as a member of the House of Lords, was irresponsible and inappropriate&quot;. At a later meeting at Edinburgh University the following November, Tonge said that professors Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer&#x27;s article &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot; which appeared in the 23 March 2006 issue of the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; supported her assertion that the &quot;Israel lobby had a disproportionate voice in Anglo-American foreign policy&quot;. She said her comments &quot;were about the Israeli lobby in politics. They were a big distance from being about Jewishness or anti-Semitism&quot;.

====The Gaza strip and other issues (2008–10)====
In November 2008, Tonge visited the Gaza Strip again, this time with Lord Ahmed, Clare Short, and members of the European Parliament.

From 8 January 2009 to 12 February 2010, Tonge was the Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Health. On 12 January 2009, Tonge asked in the House of Lords about investigations into alleged Israeli war crimes in the December 2009–January 2010 Gaza War, saying:Is the Minister aware that Mrs Pillay, the new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has spoken of war crimes being committed in Gaza? Will the Government, therefore, show leadership and call for the immediate—and I mean immediate—establishment by the United Nations Security Council of an independent fact-finding commission to Palestine to investigate all breaches of international law?

In March 2009, Tonge joined a six-person delegation of British politicians which met with Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal in Syria. Tonge told an interviewer that their goal was to force the British government to talk to Hamas and press the United States to do likewise. She stated: &quot;You don&#x27;t make peace by talking to your friends. You make peace by talking to your enemies&quot;, and said she knew that her meeting with Meshaal might be considered illegal and lead to her arrest. &quot;That is one of the risks that you take&quot;, she said.

During the 2008–2009 Gaza War, Tonge spoke at a London rally against the war, saying: &quot;It is a disgusting, obscene outrage what is going on in Gaza&quot;. She said that eventually activists must look to &quot;a full trade embargo and boycotting everything Israeli&quot;.

On 1 February 2010, &quot;The Palestine Telegraph&quot;, of which Tonge was then a patron, published an article which made false claims that an Israel Defence Forces emergency aid hospital in Haiti (deployed in the aftermath the 2010 Haiti earthquake) was secretly harvesting organs and selling them on the black market, based partly on a report made on Hezbollah&#x27;s Al-Manar television which cited a YouTube video produced by a group called AfriSynergy Productions. The video did not cite any evidence, nor did it portray any actual organ removal. She later resigned as a patron of &quot;The Palestine Telegraph&quot; after it published a video of an interview with American neo-Nazi David Duke.

On 11 February, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published an article containing a statement by Tonge which congratulated the IDF on its swift and generous response to the emergency in Haiti, and said: &quot;To prevent allegations such as these—which have already been posted on YouTube—going any further, the IDF and the Israeli Medical Association [&quot;sic&quot;] should establish an independent inquiry immediately to clear the names of the team in Haiti.&quot;

On 12 February 2010, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg removed her from her position as health spokeswoman in the House of Lords calling the comments &quot;wrong, distasteful and provocative&quot;. The released statement said she had apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; for any offence she had caused and that neither Clegg nor Tonge gave the allegations &quot;any credence whatsoever&quot;. In an email message sent to an anti-Israel activist, Tonge wrote that she had called for an inquiry to dispel any rumours and that the idea that organs could be being harvested in the situation which existed in Haiti was ludicrous and nonsense.

====Comments about Israel and the Gaza strip (2012–2021)====
In 2012, Tonge appeared at an Israeli Apartheid Week talk at Middlesex University on 23 February 2012, during which she said: &quot;Beware Israel. Israel is not going to be there forever in its present form. One day, the United States of America will get sick of giving £70bn a year to Israel to support what I call America&#x27;s aircraft carrier in the Middle East – that is Israel. One day, the American people are going to say to the Israel lobby in the USA: enough is enough. Israel will lose support and then they will reap what they have sown.&quot; A party spokesman said: &quot;Jenny Tonge does not speak for the party on Israel and Palestine. Her presence and comments at this event were extremely ill-advised and ill-judged. The tone of the debate at this event was wholly unacceptable and adds nothing to the peace process. The Liberal Democrats are wholehearted supporters of a peaceful two state solution to the Israel- Palestine issue&quot;.

Baroness Tonge resigned the Liberal Democrats whip position immediately after being given an ultimatum by party leader Nick Clegg to apologise or resign for her remarks. From this point onwards, she sat in the House of Lords as an independent Liberal Democrat.

She spoke at a London rally at the Israeli Embassy against the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and the November 2012 Israeli bombings of Gaza in retaliation for militant rocket attacks on Israel.

In January 2015, the New York Jewish newspaper &quot;Algemeiner Journal&quot; described Tonge as having &quot;a long record of inflammatory, often anti-Semitic, statements against both Israel and the British Jewish leadership&quot; in discussing a written question she had tabled in the Lords, which urged for &quot;Jewish faith leaders in the United Kingdom publicly to condemn settlement building by Israel&quot;.

Jonathan Sacerdoti of the Campaign Against Antisemitism told the &quot;Algemeiner&quot;: &quot;It is despicable to see her using the House of Lords to try to harass Jewish people&quot;. In July 2016, Tonge repeated her call for British Jews to condemn Israel resulting in calls from Campaign Against Antisemitism for her to be expelled from the Liberal Democrats.

Following Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s election as Leader of the Labour Party, Tonge said that she was considering joining Labour, having not seen the party as left-wing enough until then. Tonge expressed support for Corbyn and the former Labour MP Tony Benn: &quot;I marched alongside Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn, one on either side. I went to Gaza with Jeremy Corbyn and we met Hamas leaders together&quot;. Deputy Labour Leader Tom Watson said Tonge would be &quot;welcome&quot; in the party.

Tonge chaired a meeting of the Palestine Return Council at the House of Lords on 25 October 2016 to launch a campaign for Britain to apologise for the Balfour Declaration, which advocated a home for Jews in Palestine, ahead of its hundredth anniversary in 2017. Jennifer Gerber, the Director of Labour Friends of Israel told &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; about the absence of any &quot;reproach or redress from Baroness Tonge as chair&quot; at the gathering, at which &quot;attendees compared Israel to ISIS and claimed Jews &#x27;provoked&#x27; their own genocide. Silence in the face of such abhorrence amounts to tacit endorsement&quot;. Tonge was suspended by the Liberal Democrats, and then resigned from the party on 27 October 2016. Speaking about London&#x27;s Israeli embassy at the time, she commented: &quot;They are attacking the Lib Dems as they do Labour. They like to be in control of things&quot;.

In October 2018, Tonge faced calls to resign over a post she made on Facebook in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, in which she claimed that the Israeli government&#x27;s actions towards Palestinians may have contributed to a rise in anti-Semitism. Tonge made a similar comment in January 2021 during a House of Lords debate concerning rising anti-Semitic incidents in universities, saying &quot;The victims are innocent Jewish people—students, in this case. They are victims because of the illegal actions of the Israeli government.&quot;

====Population, health and development====
Tonge is strongly in favour of stem cell research and has stated so in the House of Lords. She is pro-choice on abortion and has supported &quot;Patient (Assisted Dying)&quot; laws in the United Kingdom.

Tonge was chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Population, Development and Reproductive Health for five years, which in November 2012 issued a report on child marriage, &quot;A Childhood Lost&quot;, which urged the British government to act to stop child marriage in Britain and abroad.

This followed other reports on Maternal Morbidity, &quot;Better off Dead&quot;, and most recently, a new report has been published on Population Dynamics and Sustainable Development. She was President of the European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development from 2011-15. In November 2015, she was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for services to women&#x27;s health in the UK and in developing countries.

<text>Michael St John Trend, CBE (born 19 April 1952) is a British former Conservative politician and journalist who was a member of parliament from 1992 to 2005, when he stood down after an expenses scandal.

==Early life==
He is the son of Lord Trend, the former Cabinet Secretary. He attended the independent Westminster School, then went to Oriel College, Oxford where he gained an MA in Modern History. He became a journalist for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;History Today&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He was chief leader writer for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; from 1990 to 1992.

==Parliamentary career==
He was elected at the 1992 General Election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire. When that constituency was abolished for the 1997 Election, he was returned for the new constituency of Windsor. Trend was a frontbench spokesman and Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive of the Conservative Party until 2000.

He was Chairman of the party&#x27;s International Office until September 2005, and has done extensive democracy building work in much of the former Soviet Union, and also in Africa.

==Fraudulent expenses claim==
In December 2002, Trend agreed to repay £90,000 to the House of Commons, after accepting that he wrongly claimed the money as an allowance. In February 2003, Trend was found guilty of abusing the allowances system, and ordered to repay £90,277.

He was briefly suspended from Parliament, and did not stand again at the following election. Trend claimed he &quot;believed that I could properly continue to designate London as &#x27;home&#x27; for the purposes of ACA, even though, in domestic terms, Windsor had become my &#x27;main residence&#x27;.&quot; It was not accepted.

There was no doubt in the Standard&#x27;s Committee&#x27;s minds that there was no &quot;real scope for doubt that the words &#x27;main residence&#x27; were intended to have other than their natural meaning.&quot; The Committee ruled that: &quot;Mr Trend should have recognised that, by claiming Additional Costs Allowance in relation to his Windsor home, the taxpayer was meeting some of the core running costs of what was in reality his main residence. He should have realised that this was wrong&quot;.

&quot;Accordingly, we agree with the Commissioner that Mr Trend was negligent, and has breached the Code of Conduct by making improper use of the Additional Costs Allowance, and by failing strictly to observe the administrative rules relating to the Allowance.&quot;

==Personal life==
He has written extensively about music. He married Jill Kershaw in February 1987, in Westminster. They have a son and two daughters. For many years, he was the organist of his local church.

<text>Jon Hedley Trickett (born 2 July 1950) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Normanton and Hemsworth, previously Hemsworth, since 1996. He was Shadow Lord President of the Council from 2016 to 2020 and served as Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2020. He was the Labour Party National Campaign Coordinator under Jeremy Corbyn from 2015 to 2017.

Trickett served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Prime Minister Gordon Brown from 2008 to 2010 and was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet by Ed Miliband in 2011 as Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office.

Trickett was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government under new Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn in September 2015, before serving as Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills from July to October 2016. He was later appointed Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office by Corbyn in February 2017, alongside his portfolio as Shadow Lord President of the Council. 

He is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, a parliamentary group of Labour MPs.

==Early life and career==
Jon Trickett was born in Leeds on 2 July 1950. He studied at Roundhay Grammar School (now called Roundhay School). He received a BA in politics from the University of Hull, and later an MA in Political Sociology from the University of Leeds.

Formed politically by the anti-Vietnam war movement, he joined the Labour Party in 1969 and was active on the Labour left in Leeds from the late 1960s. From 1974 to 1986 he worked as a builder and plumber. During the campaigns relating to the Common Market referendum in 1975 he was the secretary of the Vote No campaign in Leeds.

During the 1970s Trickett was a member of the ILP (the successor body of the Independent Labour Party), contributed to its newspaper, the &quot;Labour Leader&quot;, and was elected for a number of years to its ruling body, the National Administrative Council. Trickett was also active in anti-fascist and anti-war movements, and was a delegate to the Leeds Trades Council. Later he was the election agent for Michael McGowan who became the MEP for Leeds in 1984.

Trickett was first elected to Leeds City Council for the Beeston ward in 1984 at the age of 34. He replaced George Mudie as Leader of the Council in 1989, holding the leadership until 1996 and his election to Parliament. Brian Walker replaced Trickett as Council Leader and resigned his council seat after the May local elections.

==Parliamentary career==
===Blair and Brown governments===
At the 1996 Hemsworth by-election, Trickett was elected to Parliament as MP for Hemsworth with 71.9% of the vote and a majority of 13,875. He was re-elected as MP for Hemsworth at the 1997 general election with a decreased vote share of 70.6% and an increased majority of 23,992.

Following the general election, Trickett was made a parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Peter Mandelson and worked in the Cabinet office and subsequently the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). After leaving the government at the time of Mandelson&#x27;s fall from grace, Trickett was chair of the Compass pressure group.

At the 2001 general election, Trickett was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 65.4% and a decreased majority of 15,636.

He played a significant role in rebelling against the Iraq War and participated in demonstrations against it in London, Wakefield, and Leeds. He rebelled on a number of occasions against Tony Blair&#x27;s reforms to public services. He led the demands for a recall of parliament at the time of the Israeli attacks on the Lebanon, and the campaign inside the Commons to amend the Companies Bill to secure public listed companies reporting on &#x27;supply chain issues&#x27; in line with the suggestions of a range of non governmental organisations. 

At the 2005 general election, Trickett was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 58.8% and a decreased majority of 13,481.

Trickett had previously voted against the Blair Government&#x27;s 90-day detention proposals in the Terrorism Act 2006, which had been publicly advocated by the police, and was joined by both Labour and Conservative MPs in the vote, the only time Blair was defeated in the Commons. Trickett and Cruddas voted in favour of the subsequent 28-day detention proposal, and Trickett then resigned from his position in Compass after voting in favour of the legislation despite opposition to the Bill from some members of Compass.

In June 2007 he was asked by Gordon Brown to chair the party&#x27;s manifesto group on housing, a position which he declined to take up. Following the cabinet reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Trickett became the Parliamentary private secretary to the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.

===In opposition===
At the 2010 general election, Trickett was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 46.8% and a decreased majority of 9,844.

On 7 October 2011, Trickett was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office by Labour Leader Ed Miliband. He was re-elected to the House of Commons at the 2015 general election with a majority of 12,078.

At the 2015 general election, Trickett was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 51.3% and an increased majority of 12,078.

Trickett was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015. 

In February 2016, a former British National Party candidate was convicted of making an anti-semitic verbal attack upon Trickett.

On 27 June 2016 Trickett was appointed as Shadow Lord President of the Council and Campaigns and Elections Director. Later that year, Trickett was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.

In July 2016, Trickett apologised for comments on Twitter which appeared to liken an attempted coup in Turkey to attempts to oust Jeremy Corbyn. Trickett deleted the relevant tweet and apologised, saying: &quot;Okay okay. Tweet deleted and withdrawn. Shouldn&#x27;t tweet when feeling ill. I apologise sincerely&quot;.

At the snap 2017 general election, Trickett was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 56% and a decreased majority of 10,174. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 37.5% and a decreased majority of 1,180.

On 5 April 2020, following the election of Keir Starmer as Leader of the Labour Party, Trickett was asked to stand down from his frontbench roles. He had backed Rebecca Long-Bailey for the party leadership.

Due to the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies, Trickett&#x27;s constituency of Hemsworth was abolished, and replaced with Normanton and Hemsworth. At the 2024 general election, Trickett was elected to Parliament as MP for Normanton and Hemsworth with 47.5% of the vote and a majority of 6,662.

=== Starmer government ===
In September 2024, Trickett was the only MP from the Labour Party to vote for a parliamentary motion which would block the Labour government&#x27;s plan to means test the Winter Fuel Payment for pensioners, becoming part of the significant backlash to it, arguing that this reform would lead to a further increase in poverty among pensioners during the coming winter, which he warned would be &quot;extremely difficult for my constituents of all ages&quot;. Trickett had supported the introduction of the payment as a universal benefit to pensioners, by Labour chancellor Gordon Brown in 1997.

==Personal life==
Trickett married Sarah Balfour on 31 October 1993. They have three children.

Tartu County lies in South Estonia, between Lake Võrtsjärv and Lake Peipus. Estonia&#x27;s only navigable river, River Emajõgi (100 km long), flows through the county, connecting Lake Peipus and Lake Võrtsjärv. Wavy plains are typical landscapes of Tartu County. One third of the county is covered with forests, a third is cultivated. A quarter is made up of wetlands at the headwaters and lower course of the Emajõgi. In the northern part of the county, there are drumlin fields with lakes between them. Nature reserves, such as Pähklisaar Nature Reserve, Emajõe Suursoo and Alam-Pedja take up about 10% of the county&#x27;s territory.


== History ==
Archaeological findings suggest that people first inhabited the territory of the current Tartu County about 5000 years ago. City of Tartu was first mentioned in historical records in 1030, when Yaroslav I the Wise organized a military campaign against Chuds, defeated them and established fort Yuryev in what is modern day Tartu. In 1224, after the conquest of the stronghold by the German invaders, Tartu became the capital of a diocese, stretching from Northern Estonia to Latvia. Since the 13th century, Tartu belonged to the Hanseatic League, and the town became a well-known trade centre in the Baltic Sea region. In 1569, together with Duchy of Livonia, Tartu became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1598 Tartu became capital of the Dorpat Voivodeship, which remained part of the PLC until the 1620s, when the city was conquered by the Swedes.

King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden established the University of Tartu in 1632. Estonia&#x27;s first teachers&#x27; training school was established in Tartu County in 1684, as well as the first Estonian schools for the children of peasants. Closed during and after the Great Northern War, Tartu University was re-opened in 1802 as the only university operating in German language in the Russian Empire. Economic development of the region was further encouraged by the construction of the railway connecting Tartu with Tallinn, Riga and St. Petersburg. In the second half of the 19th century, the national awakening of Estonians began from Tartu region. After Estonia gained independence in 1918, Tartu, along with Tallinn, became one of the two main cultural centres of Estonia, where most of the Estonian intelligentsia of the time lived and worked. In 1987–1989, the students&#x27; environmental and cultural heritage movement in Tartu initiated Estonia&#x27;s Singing Revolution and restoration of the country&#x27;s independence.

<doc id="450296" wikidata="Q7568430" url="?curid=450296" title="South Shore, Staten Island">
<text>The South Shore is a geographical term applied to the area in the New York City borough of Staten Island, south and east of the island&#x27;s ridge of hills (and Richmond Creek and Fresh Kills south of Historic Richmond Town) along the waterfront and adjacent areas from the Narrows to the mouth of the Arthur Kill. Many observers prefer to restrict its scope to the neighborhoods located between the shoreline of Raritan Bay on one side and Richmond Creek and Fresh Kills on the other, thus encompassing the neighborhoods of Great Kills to Tottenville only. Those who use this narrower definition of the &quot;South Shore&quot; prefer the term &quot;East Shore&quot; for the communities that lie along Lower New York Bay, and inland for approximately 2 to miles, from Bay Terrace and Richmondtown to as far north as Grasmere and Concord. The South Shore (under the narrower definition) is represented in the New York City Council by Joe Borelli.
Geologically, the area is an outwash plain of glacial sediment formed from the edge of the terminal moraine, and continues as an underwater shoal into Lower New York Bay, where it was a prime oystering ground in the 19th century.

Prior to the 1960s, the South Shore was undeveloped. After the building of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, the South Shore experienced rapid urbanization and its population rose sharply. The population is predominantly white, but according to census data has been growing more heterogeneous in recent years. Many residents are of Italian, Irish, English, and Jewish descent, with a massive boom to the Italian population in the 1980s and 1990s. The area generally has a low crime rate except for thefts.

Commerce was previously dominated by small businesses despite the presence of Hylan Boulevard running along the eastern boundary of the South Shore. However, a number of shopping centers have been built over the last decade. The area is still known for small businesses, including 24-hour delis, pork stores, pizzerias, cafés, gourmet food shops, and a number of independently owned pharmacies, florists, hair, tanning and nail salons, paint stores, and car repair shops.

==Transportation==

Staten Islanders on the South Shore have the longest average commute of anyone in New York City. Commuters to Manhattan have the option of express buses, which run along Hylan Boulevard, Richmond Avenue, and New York State Route 440, or the Staten Island Railway. Express train service cuts the commute time to and from the Staten Island Ferry. Morning express trains make all local stops to New Dorp station, and then express to the St. George Terminal. In the evening, express trains travel from St. George to Great Kills station, then make all local stops until Tottenville station. Local trains make all stops.

The Charleston Bus Depot opened in January 2011 at Arthur Kill Road in Charleston.

Talks have been underway to implement a new Fast Ferry service from the Prince&#x27;s Bay/Mount Loretto area on the Raritan Bay to both Midtown Manhattan and the Wall Street area. It is estimated based on several studies that the ridership base for such a ferry route would be substantial, given the lack of sufficient alternative public transportation from this area and its population of high-income professionals commuting to Manhattan.

Many commuters from the South Shore of Staten Island drive over the Outerbridge Crossing to the Park &amp; Ride facility operated by NJ Transit at the Metropark Train Station in Iselin, NJ, which offers rail service to Newark Penn Station, New York Penn Station, and their many connecting services.

<text>Bernard de Jussieu (; 17 August 1699 – 6 November 1777) was a French naturalist, younger brother of Antoine de Jussieu.

Bernard de Jussieu was born in Lyon. He took a medical degree at Montpellier and began practice in 1720, but finding the work uncongenial he gladly accepted his brother&#x27;s invitation to Paris in 1722, when he succeeded Sebastien Vaillant (1669–1722) as sub-demonstrator of plants in the Jardin des Plantes. In 1725, he brought out a new edition of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort&#x27;s &quot;Histoire des plantes qui naissent aux environs de Paris&quot;, 2 vols., which was afterwards translated into English by John Martyn, the original work being incomplete. In the same year he was admitted into the French Academy of Sciences, and communicated several papers to that body.
Long before Abraham Trembley (1700–1784) published his &quot;Histoire des polypes d&#x27;eau douce&quot;, Jussieu maintained the doctrine that these organisms were in fact animals, and not the flowers of marine plants, which was the notion at the time; to confirm his views, he made three journeys to the coast of Normandy. Singularly modest and retiring, he published very little, but in 1759 he arranged the plants in the royal garden of the Grand Trianon in the Palace of Versailles, according to his own scheme of classification. This arrangement is printed in his nephew Antoine Laurent de Jussieu&#x27;s &quot;Genera plantarum&quot;, and formed the basis of that work. He cared little for the credit of enunciating new discoveries, so long as the facts were made public. On the death of his brother Antoine, he could not be induced to succeed him as professor of botany at the Jardin des Plantes, but prevailed upon L. G. Lemonnier to assume the higher position.

He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1749.

The standard botanical author abbreviation B.Juss. is applied to plants described by de Jussieu.

<text>Bromberg was the northern of two Prussian government regions, or &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; (), of the Grand Duchy of Posen (1815–1848) and its successor, the Province of Posen (1848–1919). The administrative center was the city of Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), which is now part of Poland.

The region was bordered on the south by the Regierungsbezirk Posen, to the west by the Province of Brandenburg, to the north by West Prussia, and to the east by Congress Poland (part of the Russian Empire).

The Bromberg region had a larger percentage of mostly Protestant Germans than average for the Province of Posen. Other German speakers were by religion Jewish or Roman Catholic. However, around half the population were Roman Catholic Poles. Initially, there was a sizable Jewish minority, but that number diminished over time due to the &quot;Ostflucht&quot;.

==Divisions==
Note: Prussian provinces were subdivided into units called &quot;Kreise&quot; (singular &quot;Kreis&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Kr.&quot;, English &quot;circle&quot;), which were similar to small counties in US terms, &quot;rural districts&quot; in British terms. The larger cities would have their own &quot;Stadtkreis&quot; (English: &quot;urban district&quot;) and the surrounding rural area would be named for the city, but referred to as a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (English: &quot;rural district&quot;). In the case of Posen, the Landkreis was split into two: Landkreis Posen West, and Landkreis Posen East. The region was originally divided into several larger &quot;Kreise&quot;, which were later divided into the final 13 &quot;Kreise&quot;, the larger ones spinning off smaller units.

<text>Zeebrugge (; from , meaning &quot;Bruges-on-Sea&quot;; , ) is a village on the coast of Belgium and a subdivision of Bruges, for which it is the modern port. Zeebrugge serves as both the international port of Bruges-Zeebrugge and a seafront resort with hotels, cafés, a marina and a beach.

== Location ==

Zeebrugge is located on the coast of the North Sea. Its central location on the Belgian coast, short distance to Great Britain and close vicinity to densely populated industrialised cities make it a crossroads for traffic from all directions. An expressway to Bruges connects Zeebrugge to the European motorway system; one can also get to and from Zeebrugge by train or tram. A 12 km canal links the port to the centre of Bruges.

It is Belgium&#x27;s most important fishing port and the wholesale fish market located there is one of the largest in Europe.

Aside from being a passenger terminal with ferries to the United Kingdom, the harbour serves as the central port for Europe&#x27;s automotive industry, and it is important for the import, handling and storage of energy products, agriculture products and other general cargo. Zeebrugge has the largest LNG terminal complex in Europe.

== History ==
=== 1918 Zeebrugge Raid ===

The harbour was the site of the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918, when the British Royal Navy temporarily put the German inland naval base at Bruges out of action. Admiral Roger Keyes planned and led the raid that stormed the German batteries and sank three old warships at the entrance to the canal leading to the inland port. This action was a partial success as it blocked the access, but the Germans dug a new canal around the ships. The raid, although a morale-boosting victory in Britain, was also claimed as a victory in Germany.

=== 1987 ferry disaster ===

Later, in 1987, Zeebrugge&#x27;s harbour was the scene of disaster when the MS &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; passenger ferry capsized, having set sail with her bow doors open, killing 193 people.

<text>John Martyn or Joannes Martyn (12 September 1699 – 29 January 1768) was an English botanist.

==Life==
Martyn was born in London, the son of a merchant. He attended a school in the vicinity of his home, and when he turned 16, worked for his father, intending to follow a business career. He married Marie Anne Fonnereau, daughter of Claude Fonnereau, a Huguenot refugee who had settled in England and become a successful merchant. Martyn abandoned his business pursuits in favour of medical and botanical studies. His interest in botany came from his acquaintance with an apothecary, John Wilmer, and Dr. Patrick Blair, a surgeon-apothecary from Dundee who practiced in London. Martyn gave some botanical lectures in London in 1721 and 1726, and in 1727 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

Martyn was one of the founders (with Johann Jacob Dillenius and others) and the secretary of a botanical society which met for a few years in the Rainbow coffee-house, Watling Street.

In 1732 he was appointed Professor of Botany at Cambridge University, but, finding little encouragement and hampered by a lack of equipment, he soon ceased lecturing. He retained his professorship, however, until 1768, when he resigned in favour of his son Thomas. On resigning the botanical chair at Cambridge he presented the university with a number of his botanical specimens and books.

John Martyn married Eulalia King, daughter of John King (1652–1732), rector of Pertenhall in Bedfordshire and Chelsea in London. Their son, Thomas Martyn (1735–1825) was also an eminent botanist, author of &quot;Flora rustica&quot; (1792–1794).
After the death of his first wife, John Martyn married Mary Anne Fonnereau, daughter of Claude Fonnereau, merchant of London and Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich, and the brother of Thomas Fonnereau.

Although he had not taken a medical degree, he long practised as a physician at Chelsea, which is where he died in 1768.

His son Thomas wrote a memoir of his father in 1770. An expanded version of this memoir was prepared and published by George Gorham in 1830.

==Work==

He is best known for his &quot;Historia Plantarum Rariorum&quot; (1728–1737, illustrated by Jacob van Huysum), and his translation, with valuable agricultural and botanical notes, of the Eclogues (1749) and Georgics (1741) of Virgil. Editions continued to be issued after his death.

With Ephraim Chambers, author of the famous &quot;Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot;, he abridged and translated the &quot;Philosophical History and Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris&quot;, which was published in 1742. He also started the &quot;Grub Street Journal&quot;, a weekly satirical review, which lasted from 1730 to 1737.

<text>Posen was the southern of two Prussian administrative regions, or &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; (), of the Grand Duchy of Posen (1815–1849) and its successor, the Province of Posen (1849–1918). The administrative region was bordered on the north by Regierungsbezirk Bromberg, to the west by the Province of Brandenburg, to the south by the Silesia Province, and to the east by Russian Congress Poland.

The Posen region was inhabited mainly by Poles practicing Roman Catholicism, although it had a minority of Germans, mostly Protestants. After World War I, most of the territory of this region was ceded to Poland.

==Divisions==
Note: Prussian provinces were subdivided into units called &quot;Kreise&quot; (singular &quot;Kreis&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Kr.&quot;, English &quot;circle&quot;), which were similar to large counties in US terms. Cities would have their own &quot;Stadtkreis&quot; (English: &quot;urban district&quot;) and the surrounding rural area would be named for the city, but referred to as a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (English: &quot;rural district&quot;). In the case of Posen, the &quot;Landkreis&quot; was split into two: Landkreis Posen West, and Landkreis Posen East. The region was originally divided into 16 larger &quot;Kreise&quot;, which were later divided into the final 27 &quot;Kreise&quot;, the larger ones spinning off smaller units.

== Demographics ==
The administrative region of Posen had a majority Polish population, with a significant German minority who were mostly concentrated in the western districts.

<text>Antoine [[de Jussieu]] (6 July 168622 April 1758) was a French naturalist, botanist, and physician. 

Jussieu was born in Lyon, the son of Christophe de Jussieu (or Dejussieu), an apothecary of some repute, who published a &quot;Nouveau traité de la theriaque&quot; (1708). Antoine studied at the University of Montpellier, and travelled with his brother Bernard through Spain, Portugal, and southern France. He went to Paris in 1708. Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, whom he succeeded at the Jardin du Roi, later the Jardin des Plantes, died in that year.

His own original publications are not of marked importance, but he edited an edition of Tournefort&#x27;s &quot;Institutions rei herbariae&quot; (3 vols., 1719), and a posthumously published work of Jacques Barrelier, &quot;Plantae per Galliam, Hispaniam, et Italiam observatae, &amp;c.&quot; (1714).

He practiced medicine, chiefly devoting himself to the very poor. His teaching was the subject of a posthumous publication, in 1772, entitled &quot;Traité des vertus des plantes&quot;&quot;.&quot;

His brother Bernard de Jussieu is better known.

<text>GNOWSYS (Gnowledge Networking and Organizing system) is a specification for a generic distributed network based memory/knowledge management. It is developed as an application for developing and maintaining semantic web content. It is written in Python. It is implemented as a Django app. The GNOWSYS project was launched by Nagarjuna G. in 2001, while he was working at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE).

The memory of GNOWSYS is designed as a node-oriented space. A node is described by other nodes to which it has links. The nodes are organized and processed according to a complex data structure called the neighborhood.

==Applications==

The application can be used for web-based knowledge representation and content management projects, for developing structured knowledge bases, as a collaborative authoring tool, suitable for making electronic glossaries, dictionaries and encyclopedias, for managing large web sites or links, developing an online catalogue for a library of any thing including books, to make ontologies, classifying and networking any objects, etc. This tool is also intended to be used for an on-line tutoring system with dependency management between various concepts or software packages. For example, the dependency relations between Debian packages have been represented by the gnowledge portal .

==Component Classes==
The kernel is designed to provide support to persistently store highly granular nodes of knowledge representation like terms, predicates and very complex propositional systems like arguments, rules, axiomatic systems, loosely held paragraphs, and more complex structured and consistent compositions. All the component classes in GNOWSYS are classified according to complexity into three groups, where the first two groups are used to express all possible well formed formulae permissible in a first order logic.

===Terms===
‘Object’, ‘Object Type’ for declarative knowledge, ‘Event’, ‘Event Type’, for temporal objects, and ‘Meta Types’ for expressing upper ontology. The
objects in this group are essentially any thing about which the knowledge engineer intends to express and store in the knowledge base, i.e., they are the objects of discourse. The instances of these component classes can be stored with or without expressing ‘instance of’ or ‘sub-class of’ relations among them.

===Predicates===
This group consists of ‘Relation’, and ‘Relation Type’ for expressing declarative knowledge, and ‘Function’ and ‘Function Type’ for expressing procedural knowledge. This group is to express qualitative and quantitative relations among the various instances stored in the knowledge base. While instantiating the predicates can be characterized by their logical properties of relations, quantifiers and cardinality as monadic predicates
of these predicate objects.

===Structures===
‘System’, ‘Encapsulated Class’, ‘Program’, and ‘Process’, are other base classes for complex structures, which can be combined iteratively to produce more complex systems. The component class ‘System’ is to store in the knowledge base a set of propositions composed into ontologies, axiomatic systems, complex systems like say a human body, an artifact like a vehicle etc., with or without consistency check. An ‘Encapsulated Class’ is to com-
pose declarative and behavioural objects in a flexible way to build classes. A ‘Program’ is not only to store the logic of any complete program or a component class, composed from the already available behavioural instances in the knowledge base with built-in connectives (conditions, and loops), but also execute them as web services. A ‘Process’ is to structure temporal objects with sequence, concurrency, synchronous or asynchronous specifications.

Every node in the database keeps the neighbourhood information, such as its super-class, sub-class, instance-of, and other relations, in which the object has a role, in the form of predicates. This feature makes computation of drawing graphs and inferences, on the one hand, and dependency and navigation paths on the other hand very easy. All the data and metadata is indexed in a central catalogue making query and locating resources efficient.

<text>Paul Anthony Truswell (born 17 November 1955) is an English Labour Party politician and former Member of Parliament (MP) for Pudsey from 1997 to 2010.

Born in Sheffield, Truswell moved to Leeds at 18 to study History at the University of Leeds and initially worked as a journalist for the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; for a decade. He then spent another ten years working in local government in social services at Wakefield Council.

He was elected at the age of 26 as a Leeds City Councillor for Headingley ward, until his election to Parliament after 15 years on the council.

Truswell retired as an MP at the 2010 general election. He had announced on 8 July 2009 that, &quot;we all have to deal with life&#x27;s many problems, but my recent traumatic car crash... has come on top of a period when I have found it increasingly difficult to undertake my heavy workload as an MP and to cope with a succession of family and personal issues, including illness, bereavement, and caring responsibilities. I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that I do not, at this time, have the physical and mental stamina to fulfil both of the hugely demanding roles of MP and parliamentary candidate in the run-up to the next general election.&quot;

After leaving Parliament, he was re-elected to Leeds City Council in May 2012 for the Middleton Park ward. He stood down from the council in 2023.

<text>Anne Katherine Carnell (née Knowlman; born 30 May 1955) is an Australian businesswoman and former Liberal Party politician, who served as the third Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) from 1995 to 2000.

==Early life and pharmacy career==
Carnell was born on 30 May 1955, in Brisbane, Queensland. Her parents owned a small accounting business.

As a teenager she struggled with anorexia and went to hospital in Sydney to recover. She battled the illness for four years.

Heading back to Brisbane after her hospitalisation, Carnell returned to her studies and graduated from the University of Queensland in 1976 with a pharmacy degree. She married Ian Carnell in July 1977 and together they moved to Canberra, arriving August 1977. She bought her own pharmacy business in Red Hill in 1981. She owned and managed the pharmacy until 2000.

She was the inaugural chairman of the ACT Branch of the Australian Pharmacy Guild, serving in the position between 1988 and 1994, and National Vice-President of the guild between 1990 and 1994.

Other positions she occupied included: Chairman of the Canberra and Southern District Pharmacists Company Ltd (1982–1992), Vice-President of the Retail Industry and Training Council, ACT (1987–1991), Councillor at the Australian Institute of Pharmacy Management (1990–1991), Member of the ACT Board of Health (1990–1991), and a Member of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (1990–1991). 

Kate Carnell is currently active as the inaugural SPA Council Chair as of January, 2025.

==Politics==
Carnell joined the Liberal Party in 1991 and was elected to the second ACT Legislative Assembly in 1992. She became the Leader of the Opposition in 1993, succeeding Trevor Kaine.

After winning 7 of 17 seats in the 1995 ACT election, the Liberal Party formed a minority government with Carnell as Chief Minister. The government was re-elected in the 1998 election. She has held the portfolios of Minister for Health and Community Care (1995–1998), Minister Responsible for Multicultural and International Affairs (1995–2000), Minister for Business and Employment (1997–1998) and Minister for Business, Tourism and the Arts (2000). 

===Canberra hospital implosion===

The Carnell Government was severely criticised following the death of twelve-year-old Katie Bender, when the de-commissioned Royal Canberra Hospital was imploded on 13 July 1997 to make way for the National Museum of Australia. Bender died instantly when she was struck by a one kilogram fragment of metal sliced through her head which had been thrown about 430 metres across Lake Burley Griffin by the force of the explosion. 

The Coroner cleared Carnell as Chief Minister of any personal responsibility. The Coroner did find in his report that the Government had turned the implosion into a &#x27;public circus&#x27; and that this was with the approval of the Chief Minister. The public was invited by the Government to attend and witness the event, resulting in the largest crowd in Canberra&#x27;s history, in excess of 100,000. The Coroner found that the Government had been cavalier in its attitude to the warnings from a health union about the possible dangers of some aspects of the proposed implosion. The Coroner summarised that, &quot;the evidence on this topic leads me to conclude that Carnell was poorly briefed and advised on this subject matter. The quality of the reply to the HSUA was sacrificed in the interests of speed and expediency&quot;.

=== Bruce Stadium redevelopment ===
In October 2000, Carnell resigned, pre-empting a no-confidence motion in relation to cost over-runs in the Bruce Stadium redevelopment project (now known as Canberra Stadium). The project had a $27.3 million budget, of which $12.3 million was provided for by the ACT government and $15 million was to be sourced from the private sector. However, the project eventually cost $82 million, and was solely funded by the government. An ACT Auditor-General&#x27;s review found that the project&#x27;s $27.3 million cost estimate had not undergone proper assessment, review or analysis. Carnell had denied any wrong-doing and claimed that the Auditor-General had found that the cabinet was acting reasonably in the matter as she was determined to remain in office. The review also found that while private financing had been included in the project budget, no funds had been offered or provided by the private sector.

===Resignation===
Carnell resigned as Chief Minister on 17 October 2000, before the no-confidence motion was moved against her. She was replaced as Chief Minister by Gary Humphries.

Reflecting on the end of her career in 2012, Carnell told media that she took ministerial responsibility for breaches of the Financial Management Act related to the Bruce Stadium redevelopment because it had occurred in her portfolio, even though the breaches happened without her knowledge. Carnell told reporters that interpretation of ministerial responsibility in the Legislative Assembly had become &quot;really different&quot; in the time since, comparing her downfall in 2000, to current events in 2012, surrounding former Chief Minister Katy Gallagher, who was cleared of ministerial responsibility for data-tampering in her health portfolio.

== Life after politics ==
After resigning her post as the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, Carnell has worked in a variety of positions.

* She made a successful bid for election to the NRMA board in August 2001. Carnell resigned her role as NRMA director in 2002.
* She was appointed chairperson of General Practice Education and Training Ltd by the health minister Michael Wooldridge in 2001, and re-appointed by Woolridge&#x27;s successor Tony Abbott in 2004. 
* She spent three years as executive director of the National Association of Forest Industries (NAFI). 
* Between 2006 and 2008 Carnell was the chief executive officer at the Australian General Practice Network. 
* In 2008 Carnell was appointed as the CEO of the Australian Food and Grocery Council. 
* She was the CEO of the non-profit organisation, beyondblue, from 2012 to 2014.
* Since March, 2016, Carnell was the inaugural Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO).

She was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the Australia Day Honours list of 2006, for her services and contributions to the Australian Capital Territory.

On 29 July 2007, nearly a decade after her first marriage dissolved, Carnell and her long-term partner, Ray Kiley, married at a ceremony conducted at Old Parliament House in Canberra.

In April 2013, Carnell received an honorary doctorate from the University of Canberra.

In October 2019 she was named one of the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; 100 Women of Influence in the Public Policy category.

In June 2023, she helped found the Liberals for Yes group, a group of Liberal Party supporters who support the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, despite federal leader Peter Dutton being opposed to it.

Kate Carnell has been appointed as the inaugural SPA Council Chair as of January, 2025.

==Personal life==
Carnell&#x27;s daughter, Clare, is the co-founder of the Independents for Canberra party.

<doc id="450314" wikidata="Q272155" url="?curid=450314" title="Andrew Turner (politician)">
<text>Andrew John Turner (born 24 October 1953) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Isle of Wight from 2001 to 2017. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as its vice-chairman from 2003 until 2005.

Born in Coventry, Turner was educated at Rugby School and Keble College, Oxford. He stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate for both the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency in the 1992 general election and for the Birmingham East constituency in the 1994 European Parliamentary election.

Turner was elected MP for the Isle of Wight in the 2001 general election. He attracted press attention and criticism during the parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009. He was re-elected in the 2010 election, after which he led the One Wight campaign against government plans to dismantle his constituency. Turner announced that he would stand down at the 2017 election following reports that he had told a group of schoolchildren he thought homosexuality was &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;dangerous to society&quot;.

==Early life and career==

Born in Coventry, Turner was educated at Rugby School, an independent school for boys in the market town of Rugby in Warwickshire, followed by Keble College at the University of Oxford, receiving an MA in Geography. He later studied to be a teacher at the University of Birmingham and Henley Management College.

Turner taught geography in comprehensive schools. Turner was an education advisor to the previous Conservative government and founded the Grant Maintained Schools Foundation which he ran from 1988 to 1997. He was a councillor on Oxford City Council for several years. In 2000, he worked for the Labour-controlled London Borough of Southwark on outsourcing their education provision following a negative report from Ofsted.

Prior to becoming a member of parliament, Turner contested other elections for the Conservative Party. In 1992 Turner stood in the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency, however fell short of a majority by 9,016 to Labour candidate Brian Sedgemore. In 1994 he stood in the European elections for Birmingham East, coming second again to Labour. At the 1997 election, Turner was the Conservative candidate on the Isle of Wight, coming second to Liberal Democrat MP Peter Brand.

== Parliamentary career ==
Turner ousted Peter Brand at the 2001 general election, with a swing of 5.7% for the Conservatives and 2,826 more votes than the Liberal Democrats. It was one of the few gains for the Conservative Party at the election.

After his election to parliament, Turner was selected to serve as executive of the 1922 Committee of the Conservative Party and as a member of the Education and Skills Select Committee. He also acted as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party from 2003 to 2005. In 2005, he extended his majority to 12,978 (48.9% of the vote).

Later in the year, he was moved to the Conservative frontbench, being given the role of Shadow Minister for Charities, replacing Jacqui Lait, until 2006, when he was replaced by Greg Clark. During his time on the Conservative frontbench, he was the party&#x27;s spokesman on the Charities Bill. From 5 February 2008, he was on the Justice Committee.

In the 2010 general election, Turner was re-elected as MP for the Isle of Wight with a majority of 10,527 from a total of 32,810 votes, 2.3% less than in the previous election, but still a comfortable win with a 46.7% vote share. Turner has broken the Conservative Party whip on rare occasions.

In 2011, Turner declared his support for capital punishment.

===Expenses claims===
Following the MPs expenses scandal of 2009, Andrew Turner announced that all his expenses would be published online. His constituency home in Newport was registered in 2009 as his second home. It was reported in May 2009 that in 2008 he had claimed £137,641, putting him in 438th place of 645 MPs. £108,842 of which was used to run his Newport-based office which employs four full-time staff including his partner and parliamentary assistant, Carole Dennett.

In June 2009 his expenses were revealed by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, showing £6 spent on wrapping paper on Christmas Eve, four &quot;life coaching&quot; sessions costing £160, £240 for a member of staff to study GCSE maths, and £20 on cufflinks. In 2005 and 2006, Turner made claims for £199 and £139 for a pair of digital radios. A further claim of £10 was made for a vase for his office after a well-wisher sent him flowers following his stroke (see below). In 2004 an employment tribunal ordered Turner to pay back compensation to Colin Hedgley, a former office manager who was found to have been unfairly dismissed. Of the £10,250 in ordered compensation, Turner &quot;claimed £6,471 from parliamentary allowances and paid the rest from personal funds&quot;. He later defended the claims as fully related to his MP work, with the exception of the wrapping paper.

Further concern was expressed over a 2005 email his partner sent to the fees office regarding bank account details, which stated &quot;Look forward to receiving the money – I shall then be able to spend it on lots of booze so that the forthcoming election goes in an alcoholic blur&quot;. Turner later stated that, although the e-mail &quot;could be judged as inappropriate&quot;, it was merely &quot;a private joke between two people in regular contact&quot;. The &quot;Legg Report&quot; showed that 343 MPs had been asked to repay some money, including Turner whose £681.60 was the 250th highest on the list. The final report called for MPs to be disallowed from employing family members; it was reported that this might affect Turner&#x27;s parliamentary assistant and partner.

In 2010–11, Turner claimed £119,315 of expenses, higher than any other MP in neighbouring Hampshire and 197th overall which included over £16,000 for accommodation, £4,800 for travel and £97,864.47 for an office and staff. Turner pointed out he had the largest number of constituents in the UK, and the claims included one-off expenditure for an office move to the Riverside Centre.

===One Wight===

In July 2010, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced plans to normalise the size of constituencies to around 77,000 with plans for part of the island to be represented by a mainland MP, something which has not happened since 1832. Two exceptions to the boundary changes had been made to Scottish islands but it was felt that as the Isle of Wight was geographically closer to the mainland, such an exception would not be necessary. The One Wight campaign, led by Turner launched with a petition on 23 July 2010 and within the first week over 1,500 people had signed, which had increased to 5,000 by the middle of August. The target of 10,000 signatures was reached over the Garlic Festival weekend in August with the final figure of 17,529 before the petition reached Downing Street.

On 6 September 2010, the OneWight petition was taken to Downing Street with Turner and several other island representatives including Labour representative Mark Chiverton and Liberal Democrat representative Jill Wareham who both stood as candidates in the 2010 general election. The goal of OneWight was to have one MP for the Isle of Wight. Turner did originally succeed in this objective, although the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies proposed the division of the island into Isle of Wight East and Isle of Wight West, electing two MPs.

===2015 re-election campaign===
In April 2015, it was reported that Turner&#x27;s election agent, David Walter, had resigned just over a week before polling day in the 2015 general election. Walter was quoted as writing in his letter of resignation that his situation was &quot;untenable&quot; because Turner&#x27;s ex-fiancée, Carole Dennett, was exercising &quot;dominance and control of all aspects [making it] impossible for me to do my job&quot;. Walter&#x27;s resignation letter also cited &quot;significant anomalies and ambiguities&quot; in campaign finances and the “disastrous situation” caused by the failure to meet the Royal Mail’s deadline for the free distribution of election material, due to the incompetence of Turner and Dennett. Walter concluded his letter by saying: &quot;Your failure to provide any leadership to your campaign – or demonstrate an ability to make decisions yourself – has led to this wholly regrettable situation. It does, of course, raise serious questions about your basic competency to continue as Member of Parliament for the Isle of Wight&quot;.

On 28 April 2015, Turner turned down a request to appear on the BBC’s &quot;South Today&quot; programme about the general election. However, Turner’s former election agent, David Walter, did take part, saying: &quot;Rather than sitting down with me face to face to try to overcome these problems, Andrew just disappeared and wouldn’t speak to me so I’ve really had to do this. It is sad, but I’ve come to the conclusion that really Andrew is not the man for the Isle of Wight&quot;. The presenter read out a statement from Turner in his absence about Walter’s claims, which said, &quot;His views aren’t shared by anybody else in [my] team&quot;.

===Controversial comments and retirement===
On 28 April 2017, Turner spoke to a group of school children at an event to engage young people in politics, and it was reported that he said that being gay &quot;isn&#x27;t normal&quot;, is &quot;wrong&quot; and a &quot;danger to society&quot;. Labour&#x27;s election campaign chair, the MP Andrew Gwynne, said &quot;there is no place for bigotry and hatred like this in modern society&quot; and anyone &quot;holding these views is&quot; not &quot;fit for public office&quot;. Turner voted against LGBT rights issues during his 16 years in parliament. Following the incident, Turner announced that he would not contest the seat at the 2017 general election.

==Personal life==

On 14 August 2006, Turner was attending the Isle of Wight County Show with his Jack Russell Terrier, when he lost hold of the lead. The dog escaped and attacked a four-year-old ferret who had to be put down. Turner later apologised to the ferret&#x27;s owner.

On 10 December 2006, it was reported that Turner had suffered a &quot;serious stroke&quot;. In late April 2007, a message on Turner&#x27;s website thanked friends and political opponents for their support and reported that he was recuperating, having since attended events around the island, and was expected to make a full recovery.

On 12 February 2010, Turner&#x27;s then partner Carole Dennett was involved in a verbal altercation with Isle of Wight Council leader Cllr David Pugh, in an incident which occurred outside a Charity Valentine&#x27;s Ball at Cowes Yacht Haven. Pugh, who swore at Dennett during the exchange, later apologised for his conduct.

On 10 December 2014, it was announced that Turner had split from Dennett, having lived with her in Newport until December 2014. In January 2015, four former party chairmen called for Turner to be replaced as 2015 General Election candidate after Dennett moved in with his parliamentary aide and made him &quot;the laughing stock of the island.&quot;

<doc id="450315" wikidata="Q3497790" url="?curid=450315" title="Gary Steelheads">
<text>The Gary Steelheads were a professional basketball team. They played in the International Basketball League (IBL), Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and the United States Basketball League (USBL). They were based in Gary, Indiana, United States, and played their home games at the Genesis Convention Center. The Steelheads were the 2006 CBA Eastern Conference champions.

==History==

Gary was awarded a franchise in the CBA in 2000. The league folded so the Steelheads joined the IBL. Former CBA franchise owners purchased the CBA name from the bankruptcy court. The IBL and IBA combined to reform the CBA in 2001. After playing five seasons in the CBA the team announced on July 21, 2006, that they would be sitting out the 2006–07 CBA season.

During that time former owner Jewell Harris Sr. was indicted on federal extortion and other charges unrelated to the team. He resigned from the team pending a sale.

On October 24, the new ownership, Showtime Sports and Entertainment, LLC (headlined by Jewell Harris Jr.), announced they would be moving to the USBL for 2007.

After one season in the USBL, which included multiple teams folding, the Steelheads joined the IBL (unrelated to the former IBL) for the 2008 season. The Steelheads sat out the 2009 season and eventually ceased operations.

<text>The Grand Rapids Hoops were a basketball team that played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Their first season was in 1989 and their final season was in 2003. Professional basketball later returned to Grand Rapids with the Grand Rapids Flight in 2004.

==League history==
The team started and played in the Continental Basketball Association until the league folded in 2001. They joined the International Basketball League for one season before returning to a resurrected CBA the following year where they stayed until their demise.

==Name history==
The team first played in 1989 as the &quot;Grand Rapids Hoops&quot;. When the team was sold in 1995 to the people who ran the &quot;Gus Macker 3-on-3&quot; Scott McNeal, the nickname changed to the &quot;Grand Rapids Mackers.&quot; The team was sold again a year later to an investment group with Bob Przybysz as the managing partner and the name reverted to the &quot;Grand Rapids Hoops&quot;.

==Home court history==
The Grand Rapids Hoops began their play in Welsh Auditorium in 1989. When the Van Andel Arena opened in the mid 1996, the Hoops moved there joining the Grand Rapids Griffins as tenants. As attendance fell, the team moved to the DeltaPlex, a smaller arena located out of the downtown area. The team disbanded in 2003. The franchise was purchased and moved to nearby Muskegon&#x27;s LC Walker Arena and renamed the Michigan Mayhem in 2004, which has now been disbanded as well.

<text>The Rockford Lightning was a basketball team that played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). They were based in Rockford, Illinois.

== History ==
The Lightning were the oldest team in the CBA, originally existing as the Lancaster Red Roses from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. That team changed their name to the Lancaster Lightning, then the franchise moved to Baltimore for a year before relocating in Rockford. Their home arena was the MetroCentre.

They were the runners-up in the 2001-02 and 2004-05 CBA seasons, losing a winner-take-all championship game to the Dakota Wizards 116–109 in 2002, and a best-of-5 series to the Sioux Falls Skyforce 3–1 in 2005.

On January 20, 2006, the team&#x27;s owner announced that the Lightning would cease operations after the season unless other investors purchased the team and continued its operations. An attempt was made to constitute a new local ownership group, but it was unsuccessful, and the team folded. The Lightning&#x27;s main rival was the Quad City Thunder.

==NBA call-ups==
* Bruce Bowen (1995-97) - Miami Heat, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, San Antonio Spurs
* Sam Mack - Vancouver Grizzlies

<text>Ernest Amédée Barthélemy Mouchez (; 24 August 1821 – 29 June 1892) was a French naval officer who became director of the Paris Observatory and launched the ill-fated &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; project in 1887.

==Life==
Born in Madrid, Spain, Mouchez embarked on a career in the French Navy as an ensign in 1843. This was a period of relative international maritime peace and much of the navy&#x27;s activities were dedicated to exploration and discovery. Mouchez was initially occupied on hydrographic studies along the coasts of Korea, China and South America, penetrating 320 km up the Paraguay River and exploring the Abrolhos Islands. He improved the practice of surveying at sea, adapting terrestrial instruments for naval use, and was especially concerned with the problems of determining longitude. He developed the use of the theodolite and meridian telescope to improve the error in establishing longitude from around 30″ to 3–4″.

Attaining the rank of post captain in 1868, he embarked on a series of expeditions to chart the coast of Algeria. However, in 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, he was called upon to make an heroic defence of the port of Le Havre.

Returning to his Algerian survey, he brought it to a conclusion in 1873, when he was elected to the Bureau des Longitudes and, in the following year, was sponsored by the &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; to observe the transit of Venus from St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean. On 9 December he made a sequence of superb photographic plates of the event.

In 1875, the &quot;Académie&quot; elected him a member of the astronomy section and in 1878 he was promoted to rear admiral and awarded the role of director of the Paris Observatory. The observatory had fallen into disrepair and disrepute since the chaos of the 1870 war and the Paris Commune of 1871. Mouchez set about a programme of reconstruction but failed to persuade the government to fund a new observatory outside the centre of Paris.

In 1887, he collaborated with Sir David Gill to host an international astronomical conference in Paris. The principal outcome of the conference was a multi-national project to compile and index a photographic atlas of the heavens, the &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot;. The project consumed massive effort over several decades before it was rendered obsolete by modern astronomical methods.

Mouchez died in Wissous, Seine-et-Oise.

<doc id="450321" wikidata="Q1189567" url="?curid=450321" title="Dennis Turner">
<text>Dennis Turner, Baron Bilston (26 August 1942 – 25 February 2014) was a British Labour Co-operative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Wolverhampton South East from 1987 to 2005.

==Early life==
Turner was born in Bradley in the Black Country and lived there his entire life. He was the son of Thomas Herbert Turner and Mary Elizabeth Peasley. He was educated at Stonefield Secondary Modern School (now South Wolverhampton and Bilston Academy) on Prosser Street in Bilston and Bilston College of Further Education (now part of City of Wolverhampton College), worked as a market trader and steelworker, and later ran a social club. He was a strong trades unionist. He was one of the youngest-ever councillors on Wolverhampton Council from 1966, rising through the ranks to become deputy leader for seven years. He was Director of Springvale Co-operative Leisure Centre. He was on West Midlands County Council from 1973–86.

==Parliamentary career==
Turner contested Halesowen and Stourbridge in the February and October general elections in 1974.

He was elected member of Parliament for Wolverhampton South East at the 1987 general election. He never held high office, serving as an opposition whip then as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Clare Short at the Department for International Development. He also campaigned on issues of Fairtrade and further education, and chaired the Commons Catering Committee. He chaired the Co-op Parliamentary Group for two years and the West Midlands group of Labour MPs. He once introduced a private member&#x27;s bill seeking to make clear in law the correct amount of froth at the top of a pint of beer.

Turner stepped down from Parliament at the 2005 general election; he announced his retirement at a very late stage, citing an impending lung operation on a collapsed diaphragm. Pat McFadden was selected to replace him.

On 13 May 2005 it was announced that he would be created a life peer, and on 20 June 2005 the title was created as Baron Bilston, of Bilston in the County of West Midlands. Turner later revealed that this choice of title was a mistake, and he had intended to take the title Baron Turner of Bilston.

==Personal life==
Lord Bilston was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association.

He married Patricia Narroway in 1976 and had a son and a daughter.

Lord Bilston died in Wolverhampton on 25 February 2014, aged 71.

<text>Desmond Stanley Turner (born 17 July 1939) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Brighton Kemptown from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
He was born in Southampton and educated at Luton Grammar School (now known as Luton Sixth Form College) on Bradgers Hill Road in Luton. At Imperial College London, he gained a BSc and MSc. At University College, London, he gained a PhD, researching Biochemistry. At Brighton Polytechnic, he got a PGCE, and subsequently became a teacher. He also became a partner in an independent brewery. He has been a lecturer at the University of Surrey and the University of Sussex.

Turner was a Councillor on East Sussex County Council 1985–1997, and on Brighton Borough Council 1994–1996 and its successor Brighton and Hove City Council 1996–97.

==Parliamentary career==
He contested Mid-Sussex in 1979.

In 2001, Turner put forward a private member&#x27;s bill in an attempt to better regulate home heating and energy efficiency in rented houses of multiple occupancy, but he had to withdraw the bill in July 2002 after government opposition to an amendment passed calling for energy savings of 30% by 2010.

During the passage of the Equality Act 2006, Turner led an early day motion which, with Waheed Alli&#x27;s amendment in the House of Lords, led the government to extend the bill&#x27;s anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ+ people by providing the statutory power to issue the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 and the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006.

Turner stood down at the 2010 general election, with the local Labour Party selecting Simon Burgess as their candidate to succeed him. Burgess did not win the seat, with Simon Kirby holding the seat until 2017.

==Personal life==
His second wife is Lynn Rogers, whom he married in September 1997 in Brighton. He has a daughter from his first marriage to Lynette Gwyn-Jones, the former Leader of Brighton and Hove Council.

<doc id="450326" wikidata="Q272098" url="?curid=450326" title="Derek Twigg">
<text>John Derek Twigg (born 9 July 1959) is a British Labour Party politician who currently serves as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Widnes and Halewood since 2024, and for its predecessor constituency, Halton, from the 1997 general election until its abolition in 2024.

==Early life==
Twigg was born in Widnes, Lancashire and attended Bankfield High School in Widnes, and afterwards Halton College of Further Education (now Riverside College). At the age of 16, he joined the Civil Service and worked for the Department for Employment (at Runcorn) for the following 19 years.

At 18, Twigg became branch secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association (now part of the Public and Commercial Services Union) before joining the Labour Party in 1979. He was elected to Cheshire County Council at the age of 21, serving as a county councillor until 1985. In 1983 he was elected to Halton Borough Council. Between 1996 and 1997, he also worked as a political consultant.

==Parliamentary career==
At the general election in 1997, Twigg succeeded Gordon Oakes as Member of Parliament for the constituency of Halton. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 10 June 1997. He was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Helen Liddell, and then to Stephen Byers, before serving as a Government Whip from June 2002 until 2004.

In December 2004, Twigg was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Education and Skills. On 1 May 2005, he was booed and jeered while defending school league tables at the annual National Association of Head Teachers conference. After the general election of May 2005, he became Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Transport.

In September 2006, Twigg was appointed Under-Secretary of State and Minister for Veterans at the Ministry of Defence. In October 2008, he was replaced in this position and, declining the offer of another ministerial post, returned to the back benches.

In 2013, he was one of 22 Labour MPs to vote against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which eventually passed with cross-party support.

==Personal life==
Twigg married Mary Cassidy in January 1988 in Widnes. He has a son and a daughter. Twigg&#x27;s wife died on 26 November 2019; this led to him stepping away from his general election campaign and allowing his constituency party to run it on his behalf.

Twigg&#x27;s interests outside politics include hill walking, military history (particularly World War II) and rugby league. A lifelong Liverpool FC supporter, Twigg attended the 1989 FA Cup semi-final tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough stadium, and watched the unfolding Hillsborough disaster from the north stand.

<doc id="450329" wikidata="Q22072" url="?curid=450329" title="John Farnham">
<text>John Peter Farnham (born 1 July 1949) is a British-born Australian singer. Farnham was a teen pop idol from 1967 until 1979, billed until then as Johnny Farnham. He has since forged a career as an adult contemporary singer. His career has mostly been as a solo artist, although he replaced Glenn Shorrock as lead singer of Little River Band from 1982 to 1985.

In November 1986, his solo single &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the Australian singles charts. The associated album, &quot;Whispering Jack&quot;, held the No. 1 position for a total of 25 weeks. Both the single and the album had top-ten success internationally, including No. 6 in the United Kingdom and No.1 in Sweden. &quot;Whispering Jack&quot; is the third-highest-selling album in Australian history, and remains the highest-selling album in Australia by an Australian act.

Farnham has become one of his country&#x27;s best-known and most popular performers, and he is the only Australian artist to have a number-one record (album or single) in five consecutive decades (echoing that of Cliff Richard in the UK), with singles including &quot;Sadie (The Cleaning Lady)&quot; in 1967, &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; in 1970, and &quot;Age of Reason&quot; in 1988; and albums &quot;Whispering Jack&quot; in 1986, &quot;Age of Reason&quot; in 1988, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; in 1990, &quot;Then Again...&quot; in 1993, &quot;33⅓&quot; in 2000, and &quot;The Last Time&quot; in 2002. Along with touring with numerous artists, including The Seekers and international acts like Stevie Nicks and Lionel Richie, he released various collaborative albums: Tom Jones on &quot;Together in Concert&quot; (2005); Olivia Newton-John and Anthony Warlow, including &quot;Highlights from The Main Event&quot; (1998); &quot;Two Strong Hearts Live&quot; (2015); and &quot;Friends for Christmas&quot; (2016).

Farnham has been recognised by many honours and awards, including 1987 Australian of the Year, 1996 Officer of the Order of Australia, and 19 ARIA Awards, including his 2003 induction into the Hall of Fame. Starting in 1969, he was voted by &quot;TV Week&quot; readers as the &#x27;King of Pop&#x27; for five consecutive years.

Aside from his recording career, Farnham performed on stage with lead roles in Australian productions of &quot;Charlie Girl&quot;, &quot;Pippin&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. He starred in his own TV series and specials, including &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot; (With Colleen Hewett), &quot;Bobby Dazzler&quot;, and Farnham and Byrne (with Debra Byrne), and as a guest on numerous other popular shows such as &quot;The Don Lane Show&quot;, &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;.
==Early life==
John Peter Farnham was born in Mile End Hospital, East London, England on 1 July 1949, to John Peter Farnham Sr., and Rose (née Pemberton) Farnham. His sisters are Jean and Jacqueline, and his younger brother is Steven. Farnham spent his first ten years in the United Kingdom before his family emigrated to Australia in 1959 to live in Melbourne, Victoria. He attended school at Yarraman Park State School (now Yarraman Oaks Primary School) in Noble Park East, and Lyndale Primary School (now Lyndale Greens Primary School) and Lyndale High School in Dandenong North.

==Musical career==
===1964–67: The Mavericks to Strings Unlimited===
As Johnny Farnham he performed with local band The Mavericks on weekends, while still attending school, from 1964. The band had a five-song repertoire. In late 1965, he was asked to join band Strings Unlimited as lead singer; it was a band composed entirely of string-only instruments, and they had a regular booking at a local hotel.

In 1966, after making the state finals of the Hoadley&#x27;s Battle of the Sounds, they recorded a three-track demo tape with Farnham on vocals, Stewart Male on lead guitar, Barry Roy on rhythm guitar, Mike Foenander on keyboards, Joe Cincotta on bass and Peter Foggie on drums.

On 29 April 1967, Strings Unlimited performed as a backing band for pop singer Bev Harrell in Cohuna. Harrell&#x27;s manager and then-boyfriend, Darryl Sambell, was impressed with Farnham&#x27;s vocals and offered to become his manager. Initially performing in Sambell&#x27;s home town of Adelaide, Farnham recorded a light advertising jingle &quot;Susan Jones&quot; (with the Susan Jones Rock Five) for airline company Ansett-ANA and was offered a solo record contract working with EMI under house producer David Mackay.

===1967–79: Teen pop idol===
Farnham&#x27;s first commercially successful recording was a cover of American novelty song &quot;Sadie (The Cleaning Lady)&quot;; Sambell had disliked it, as the lyrics were so persistent. However, EMI&#x27;s in-house producer, David MacKay, insisted, and so the single was released in November 1967. The B-side, &quot;In My Room&quot; was written by Farnham. By arrangement with Sambell, Melbourne radio DJ Stan Rofe pretended that he disliked &quot;Sadie&quot; before playing it. The song gave Farnham recognition in Australia. Rofe continued the ploy on TV&#x27;s &quot;Uptight&quot; and viewers responded with calls to play the song. It hit No. 1 on the Australian singles charts in January 1968 and remained there for 6 weeks. Selling 180,000 copies in Australia, &quot;Sadie&quot; was the highest-selling single by an Australian artist of the decade and became the biggest-selling single in Australia at that time. Rofe was a writer for &quot;Go-Set&quot;, a teen-oriented pop magazine. Another writer for the magazine, Molly Meldrum, praised Farnham&#x27;s efforts. &quot;Go-Set&quot; ran a pop poll to determine the &#x27;King of Pop&#x27;, which was first won by Normie Rowe for 1967–1968. Farnham&#x27;s 1968 singles were &quot;Underneath the Arches&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Love You&quot;; each peaked at #6.

In 1969, Farnham released his album &quot;Everybody Oughta Sing a Song&quot;, which peaked at No. 12 on the Australian albums charts. His next single was a cover of Harry Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;One&quot;; Farnham&#x27;s version peaked at #4. When &quot;TV Week&quot; sponsored the &#x27;King of Pop&#x27; awards, readers would forward their votes from coupons; Farnham won the most popular male award and was crowned &#x27;King of Pop&#x27; five consecutive times from 1969 to 1973. He recorded a cover of the B.J. Thomas hit &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot;, which became his second No. 1 hit in December 1969 and remained at top spot for seven weeks into January 1970.

Farnham&#x27;s next album, &quot;Looking Through a Tear&quot;, was released in July 1970 and peaked at #11. &quot;Comic Conversations&quot;, his single from October, peaked at #10. During 1971, Farnham teamed up with Allison Durbin, who had been chosen as &#x27;Most Popular Female Performer&#x27; at the &#x27;King of Pop&#x27; awards for 1969–71. They released an album, &quot;Together&quot;, in September and a single, &quot;Baby, Without You&quot;. in November, both peaked into the top 30 of their respective charts. As well as his singing career, Farnham performed in stage musicals, starting with &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot; in 1971, and on television variety shows either as a guest performer or as a host.

At 22, Farnham was appointed &#x27;King of Moomba&#x27; in 1972, with Melbourne paper &quot;The Sun&quot; describing him as a &quot;likeable English migrant&quot; who is &quot;King of Pop, King of Kids and today Johnny Farnham was King of Moomba.&quot; In 1972, Farnham had a top 5 national hit with a cover version of the title track from the David Cassidy international hit album, &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;.

Another stage musical for Farnham was &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; in 1971. Jillian Billman was one of the dancers, and Farnham married her on 18 April 1973. Meldrum announced their wedding plans in &quot;Go-Set&quot; but Sambell denied the early reports, and, despite being best man at the wedding, was against Billman marrying Farnham. The clean-cut pop star had made several more albums and singles, but by the mid-1970s his recording career had begun to dwindle and he turned more to stage musicals and television. Farnham and &#x27;Queen of Pop&#x27; for 1972–1973, Colleen Hewett, combined on the 1973–74 stage musical, &quot;Pippin&quot;, and its associated show album released in 1974. Also in 1974, Farnham and Hewett were co-hosts of &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot;, a children&#x27;s TV series on Channel Ten. He became familiar to viewers of &quot;Countdown&quot; when hosting its first colour transmission in early 1975 and introducing Skyhooks&#x27; performance of &quot;Horror Movie&quot;.
Relations with Sambell became strained and in January 1976 they announced their split. Farnham first turned to Kenn Brodziak, producer of &quot;Pippin&quot;, for his management during 1976–78, and then to Danny Finley, Hewett&#x27;s then husband, from 1978.

Farnham starred in a situation comedy series &quot;Bobby Dazzler&quot; as the title character during 1977–78, the pilot &quot;Me &amp; Mr Thorne&quot;, and narrated documentaries including &quot;Survival with Johnny Farnham&quot;. Farnham was in financial trouble with unpaid taxes and the collapse of a restaurant venture with Hewett and Finley. Farnham&#x27;s singing career was now confined to the cabaret circuit and stage musicals. In 1979, he changed his stage name to John Farnham.

===1980–86: Little River Band era===
Farnham met Glenn Wheatley, who was bass guitarist of 1960s rock group The Masters Apprentices, when both acts were managed by Sambell. Wheatley was now managing Little River Band (LRB), and Farnham signed with Wheatley in 1980. They decided his comeback single would be a reworking of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Help!&quot;, which was produced by LRB&#x27;s Graeham Goble, it peaked at #8. Farnham was utilising a more adult contemporary pop style and the associated album, &quot;Uncovered&quot;, also produced by Goble, peaked at #20. The B-side of &quot;Help&quot; was another of Farnham&#x27;s songwriting efforts &quot;Jillie&#x27;s Song&quot;, co-written with Goble.

In recording the album, Farnham&#x27;s studio band were guitarist Tommy Emmanuel (ex-Southern Star Band), keyboardist Mal Logan (ex-Renée Geyer Band, LRB), drummer Derek Pellicci (LRB) and bass guitarist Barry Sullivan (ex-Chain, LRB). They became his tour band until Logan and Pellicci returned to their LRB commitments and were replaced by Sam McNally and David Jones, respectively. In 1980, Farnham also appeared in a TV series entitled &quot;Farnham and Byrne&quot; with former &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; teen star and &#x27;Queen of Pop&#x27; Debra Byrne. Three other solo singles followed in 1981, but none of them charted into the top 50.

In February 1982, after Glenn Shorrock had departed Little River Band, Farnham became their lead vocalist after recommendations by Goble and Wheatley. Farnham had initially resisted the idea of joining LRB, but Wheatley convinced him that Shorrock approved of the replacement. This continued Farnham&#x27;s move away from cabaret and into rock music.

With Farnham, Little River Band recorded three studio albums, which had modest success, but it was not enough to pay back the advances the record company had provided. The first studio album, &quot;The Net&quot;, was already written, and Farnham had no say in the songs; he just had to record his lead vocals. In the US, charting albums with Farnham&#x27;s vocals included &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1982), &quot;The Net&quot; (1983), and &quot;Playing to Win&quot; (1984) on &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart/&quot;Billboard&quot; 200. While charting singles were, &quot;The Other Guy&quot;, &quot;We Two&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Driving Me Out of My Mind&quot; and &quot;Playing to Win&quot;. Farnham&#x27;s biggest Australian hits with LRB were the 1982 single &quot;Down on the Border&quot; which peaked at No. 7 and &quot;The Net&quot; which peaked at No. 11 on the albums charts in 1983.

During this time, Farnham started supplying vocal tracks for films, including &quot;Savage Streets&quot; (1984), &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1985), and &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985); he later continued with &quot;Rad&quot; (1986) and &quot;Voyage of the Rock Aliens&quot; (1987). &quot;Justice for One&quot; was co-written by Farnham, for &quot;Savage Streets&quot; and it was released as a solo single.

Little River Band recorded a concert in Melbourne that aired in the United States on HBO. The concert video was only one hour long, and it highlighted some of the songs from &quot;The Net&quot; as well as reworked versions of Little River Band classics such as &quot;Cool Change&quot; and &quot;Reminiscing&quot;. &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask Me&quot;, a song written by Goble, and a non-top 50 single for Farnham almost three years previously, was played during the &quot;Australian-themed&quot; opening of the show. Despite positive Australian and US reviews and responses, this performance has not yet been released on VHS or DVD.

In an interview with Channel Seven, Farnham stated: &quot;I&#x27;ll be better off leaving, rather than putting myself under pressure that I&#x27;ve created.&quot; Through this matter, it became apparent to the band that Farnham was intending on leaving and &quot;Playing to Win&quot;″s lead single &quot;Playing to Win&quot;, a song believed by all to be the band&#x27;s return to success, then started having authorship disputes. According to Farnham:

As a result, his relationship with the band was further sullied. To date, the royalties for the song are meticulously divided with different shares going to each of the song&#x27;s contributors, including Farnham, Goble, Wayne Nelson, Stephen Housden, David Hirschfelder, Steve Prestwich and producer Spencer Proffer. Farnham would leave the group following the completion of their short Australian tour in April 1986. Their third studio album with Farnham as lead vocalist, &quot;No Reins&quot;, appeared the following month.

===1986–97: Peak solo years===
====&quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot; and &quot;Whispering Jack&quot;====
Farnham&#x27;s first solo performances since 1981 were live shows with Brett Garsed on lead guitar, Sam See on guitar, Derek Pellicci on drums, and Bruno Di Stanislo on electric bass and vocals. While still in Little River Band, Farnham had started collecting a songlist for a future solo album. Sound engineer Ross Fraser suggested to Farnham&#x27;s manager Glenn Wheatley that it was time to start working on the solo album. Wheatley searched vainly for a producer and record label willing to work with Farnham; Fraser took on the producer role, and Wheatley provided financial support after mortgaging his house.

While visiting a jazz club in the US, Farnham was mistakenly introduced as Jack Phantom, and when he subsequently provided a running commentary for a local pool game he named himself &quot;Whispering Jack Phantom&quot; after the &quot;Pot Black&quot; commentator, &quot;Whispering Ted Lowe&quot;. His work for the album, &quot;Whispering Jack&quot;, included expanding his songlist with Fraser&#x27;s advice. &quot;A Touch of Paradise&quot; was written by Gulliver Smith and Mondo Rock&#x27;s Ross Wilson, while &quot;Pressure Down&quot; was provided by Harry Bogdanovs. Two weeks before the album was due to be recorded a demo tape arrived from London with similar material as &quot;Pressure Down&quot;, Farnham and Fraser listened to the demo of &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot; and knew they had found a once-in-a-lifetime song. Another song on offer was &quot;We Built This City&quot; but Farnham knocked it back, so it was later recorded by US band Starship.

Initially, public interest in the re-branded former teen idol was difficult to cultivate, and radio stations refused to play Farnham&#x27;s album. Things, however, started to change after Sydney radio station 2Day FM played its first single, &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot;, which was released in September 1986. Henceforth, radio stations began receiving requests for the song. Its television debut was on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; with Skyhook&#x27;s Greg Macainsh providing bass guitar. &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot;, peaked at No. 1 in Germany, Sweden and Australia, as well as being a top ten hit in some European countries: #3 in Switzerland, #6 in his native country, the UK, and No. 6 in Austria. The song was written by Andy Qunta (ex-Icehouse), Keith Reid (Procol Harum), Maggie Ryder and Chris Thompson (ex-Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band).

&quot;Whispering Jack&quot;, released in September, became the highest-selling album by an Australian act in Australia, at the time, and peaked at number one on the Australian Album Charts for a total of 25 weeks. As of 2006, it was 24× platinum indicating sales of over 1.68 million units in Australia alone. The album was released internationally on RCA/BMG and peaked at No. 1 in Sweden, No. 3 in Austria, and Top 20 in Norway. In August 1988 it returned to the Australian Top Ten. It also was the first Australian made music CD released in Australia. Other charting Australian singles were December&#x27;s &quot;Pressure Down&quot;, which peaked at No. 4, March 1987&#x27;s &quot;Touch of Paradise&quot; and September&#x27;s &quot;Reasons&quot;.

After the success of the album, Farnham followed with Jack&#x27;s Back Tour; an initial itinerary of eleven performances was thought to be enough considering they were up against tours by Michael Jackson and Billy Joel; however, after high ticket sales, it was extended by eight more shows and made use of larger venues. At that time, Jack&#x27;s Back Tour was the highest-grossing tour by an Australian act. John Farnham Band now consisted of Garsed on lead guitar, David Hirschfelder on keyboards (ex-Little River Band), Macainsh on bass and Angus Burchall on drums.

Farnham also had three tracks featured on the &quot;Rad&quot; movie soundtrack released in 1986.

Farnham won six of the inaugural 1987 ARIA Music Awards for &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27;, &#x27;Single of the Year&#x27;, &#x27;Highest Selling Album&#x27;, &#x27;Highest Selling Single&#x27;, &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27; and &#x27;Best Adult Contemporary Album&#x27;. On 19 July 1987, TV series &quot;Countdown&quot; broadcast its last show, the 1986 &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards with Farnham winning the &#x27;Best Album Award&#x27; for &quot;Whispering Jack&quot;.

In 1988, Australia&#x27;s Bicentennial Year, Farnham was named 1987 Australian of the Year, although he was not yet naturalised—a hastily organised swearing-in occurred before the honour was bestowed. He was chosen due to: &quot;his outstanding contribution to the Australian music industry over 20 years.&quot;

====&quot;Age of Reason&quot; and &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;====

Farnham&#x27;s July 1988 single, &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, which peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA singles charts, was written by Johanna Pigott and Dragon member Todd Hunter.

The album, &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, produced by Ross Fraser, debuted at No. 1 in August and stayed on top for eight weeks. It was the highest-selling album in Australia from 1988, and, as of 1997, it was 11× platinum indicating sales of over 770,000 units.

Renewed interest in &quot;Whispering Jack&quot; returned it to the Top Ten in August, nearly two years after its initial release. To date, &quot;Age of Reason&quot; remains Farnham&#x27;s last No. 1 Australian single. Other charting singles from this album were &quot;Two Strong Hearts&quot; which peaked at No. 6 and &quot;Beyond the Call&quot;. &quot;Age of Reason&quot; had international success peaking at No. 4 in Sweden, and No. 9 in Norway.

At the 1988 ARIA Awards, Farnham won &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27;, &#x27;Best Adult Contemporary Album&#x27; for &quot;Touch of Paradise&quot;, and the &#x27;Outstanding Achievement Award&#x27;. In March 1989, Farnham was in Moscow, USSR to promote Greenpeace album &quot;Rainbow Warriors&quot;, as part of an international ensemble including David Byrne (Talking Heads), Peter Gabriel, Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders), Annie Lennox (Eurythmics), and The Edge (U2).

Farnham found time to record a duet with Dannielle Gaha, &quot;Communication&quot;, which peaked at No. 13 in August 1989. It was recorded as part promotion for the Australian government&#x27;s program to control the drug epidemic happening in the mid-&#x27;80s entitled &quot;The Drug Offensive&quot;. The Drug Offensive logo can be seen attached to a television camera in the video clip made to promote the song.

&quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, produced by Fraser, was released in October 1990, and also debuted at No. 1 on the Australian album charts, it provided three Top Ten hit singles, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; in August, &quot;That&#x27;s Freedom&quot; in September and &quot;Burn for You&quot; in December.

Unlike the previous two albums, where most songs were written by outside writers, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; saw Farnham write nine of its twelve tracks with Fraser and keyboardist/musical director David Hirschfelder (ex-Little River Band) along with Phil Buckle (&quot;Burn For You&quot;) and Joe Crighton (&quot;The Time Has Come&quot;). The sound was less electronic and more acoustic, it became the biggest-selling album in Australia for 1990, and was No. 1 on the ARIA End of Year album chart. At the 1991 ARIA Awards, Farnham won &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27;, &#x27;Song of the Year&#x27; for &quot;Burn for You&quot;, and &#x27;Highest Selling Album&#x27; for &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;.

====&quot;Full House&quot; to &quot;Anthology&quot;====
Farnham&#x27;s live album, released in November 1991, was &quot;Full House&quot;, produced by Ross Fraser and Farnham, which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA album charts. It contained concert material recorded from May 1987 to October 1990. &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask Me&quot; was released as a single, which peaked into the top 30. At No. 1 on the ARIA album charts was Jimmy Barnes&#x27; album, &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, it included a duet with Farnham, &quot;When Something is Wrong with My Baby&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 on the singles charts.

In August 1992, Farnham joined the Australian production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s stage musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in the title role of Jesus. Fellow cast members included Angry Anderson as Herod, Kate Ceberano as Mary Magdalene, Russell Morris as Simon Zealotes, Jon Stevens as Judas and John Waters as Pontius Pilate. The stage soundtrack, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar The Album&quot;, provided the single &quot;Everything&#x27;s Alright&quot; by Ceberano, Farnham and Stevens, which peaked at No. 6 in September. Farnham released his next studio album, &quot;Then Again..&quot;, in October 1993, produced by Fraser and Farnham, which peaked at No. 1. Of its four singles only, &quot;Seemed Like a Good Idea (At the Time)&quot; reached the top 20. The album won &quot;Highest Selling Album&quot; at the ARIA Awards in 1994.

Farnham never really wanted to try his luck overseas even though he had offers. In a &quot;TV Week&quot; interview promoting the &quot;Romeo&#x27;s Heart&quot; album, he said that people had put pressure on him to live overseas but he had no intention of doing so. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go to America to live&quot;, he said. He went on to say the pressures for him to relocate &quot;come mainly from other people&quot; but his manager, Glenn Wheatley, has never put this pressure on him.

His single, &quot;Have a Little Faith (In Us)&quot;, in March peaked at No. 3. The associated album, &quot;Romeo&#x27;s Heart&quot;, produced by Fraser, was released in June and peaked at No. 2 and won &quot;Best Adult Contemporary Album&quot; at the ARIA Awards in 1996.

Farnham collaborated with vocal group Human Nature to record &quot;Every Time You Cry&quot; which peaked at No. 3 on the singles charts in October 1997. Also in 1997 he released a series of three compilation albums, &quot;Anthology 1: Greatest Hits 1986–1997&quot;, &quot;Anthology 2: Classic Hits 1967–1985 (Recorded Live)&quot; and &quot;Anthology 3: Rarities&quot; which all peaked in the top 20, with &quot;Anthology 1&quot; reaching #1.

===1998–present===
====&quot;The Main Event&quot; with Olivia Newton-John and Anthony Warlow====
For The Main Event Tour during October–December 1998, Farnham performed with Olivia Newton-John and Anthony Warlow. The album &quot;Highlights from The Main Event&quot; peaked at No. 1 in December, sold 4× platinum, and won &#x27;Highest Selling Album&#x27; at the 1999 ARIA Awards. &quot;The Main Event&quot; concert was broadcast on national TV and released on video.

During April–May 1999, Farnham undertook the I Can&#x27;t Believe He&#x27;s 50 Tour, supported by Merril Bainbridge, Kate Ceberano, Human Nature, James Reyne, Ross Wilson, and Nana-Zhami containing his son, Robert Farnham. &quot;Live at the Regent&quot;, recorded on 1 July 1999 (Farnham&#x27;s 50th birthday), was released in September and peaked at #7.

On 21 December, Farnham performed a set for the Tour of Duty concert in Dili for the Australian troops serving with InterFET and East Timorese people. The concert included James Blundell, Dili Allstars, Gina Jeffreys, The Living End, Kylie Minogue, Doc Neeson and the RMC Band. Tour of Duty was the first of Farnham&#x27;s concerts to be webcast.

For the 2000 Summer Olympics, Farnham and Newton-John performed &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; during the Parade of Nations at the Opening Ceremony. Broadcast of the ceremony was viewed by an estimated 3.5 billion people around the world. Farnham appeared as himself in the final episode of the Australian television series &quot;The Games&quot; (2000).

====&quot;The Last Time&quot; to Tom Jones====
On 1 January 2001, Farnham was awarded a Centenary Medal, &quot;for outstanding service to Australian music&quot;, as part of Australia&#x27;s celebration of a centenary of federation.

In 2002, Farnham announced his decision to retire from full-scale national tours after his The Last Time Tour—he would still perform in concerts and record—which commenced on 6 November 2002 and finished on 15 June 2003. In conjunction with the tour, &quot;The Last Time&quot; was released in October 2002, it peaked at No. 1 and achieved 3× platinum sales. &quot;The Last Time Tour&quot; was a countrywide concert tour, taking a circus-style tent to smaller towns and filling large entertainment venues in capital cities, it became the biggest-grossing tour in Australian history.

During July 2003, Farnham worked with Queen to produce a new version of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, released on his greatest hits album, &quot;One Voice&quot;. Media reports of Queen asking Farnham to join the band were subsequently denied by both Queen&#x27;s Brian May and Farnham. Farnham was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame on 21 October with a performance of &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot;. Farnham also won &#x27;Best Adult Contemporary Album&#x27; for &quot;The Last Time&quot;. 2002 Hall of Fame inductee was Olivia Newton-John, while in 2004 Little River Band was inducted.

Combining with singer Tom Jones, Farnham undertook the Together in Concert series during 2004 with ten shows in Perth, Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne. Duets started with &quot;That Driving Beat&quot; and &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot;, solos from Farnham were &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Pressure Down&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Freedom&quot;, &quot;Heart&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, &quot;Playing to Win&quot;, &quot;Every Time You Cry&quot;, &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;, &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, and &quot;Burn for You&quot;. The pair did five duets to close the show—Sam and Dave&#x27;s &quot;Hold On I&#x27;m Coming&quot;, Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;, Ray Charles&#x27; &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;, Arthur Conley&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Soul Music&quot; and AC/DC&#x27;s anthem, &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot;. The DVD release, &quot;Together in Concert – John Farnham &amp; Tom Jones&quot;, debuted at No 1.

Farnham&#x27;s career resurrection following &quot;The Last Time&quot;, has entered the Australian consciousness as a touchstone for others who are seen to return from a strongly-declared retirement. The announcement of the Farnham/Jones &quot;Together In Concert&quot; tour triggered an unsuccessful claim for damages from a fan, angry that &quot;The Last Time&quot; tour was not in fact Farnham&#x27;s last, as purported in its marketing. Consumer watchdog the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission took no action following this complaint.

Farnham made an appearance during the 2005 Melbourne Music Festival, raising funds for rebuilding after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake at the Tsunami Benefit Concert.

====&quot;I Remember When I Was Young&quot;====
&quot;I Remember When I Was Young: Songs from The Great Australian Songbook&quot; was released in November 2005—it contains 13 covers of hits, written and performed by Australian artists—which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA albums charts.

In February 2006, Farnham performed four shows at the Sydney Opera House, with the Sydney Symphony, followed by shows at the Victorian Arts Centre&#x27;s Hamer Hall, Melbourne. These shows were sponsored by Dairy Farmers and a percentage of revenue received from the &#x27;I Remember When I was Young&#x27; concerts went to the Dairy Farmers &#x27;Creating Greener Pastures&#x27; program to help farmers and their communities. A 2006 DVD of Farnham entitled &quot;John Farnham with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra&quot; was released, it debuted at No. 2 on the ARIA DVD charts and then peaked at #1.

From 18 February, Farnham embarked on a small Australian tour with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks for a series of live shows. Both artists had equal billing but, unlike the Tom Jones shows, they did not sing together but individually. The same backup singers from the tour, however, were used by both Nicks and Farnham.

On 26 March, Farnham sang at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony, in Melbourne starting with his hit &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, followed by &quot;I Remember When I Was Young&quot; from his most recent studio album, &quot;Playing to Win&quot; from his Little River Band days and finished with his anthem song, &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot;.

The twentieth anniversary of &quot;Whispering Jack&quot; in 2006 was marked by an &quot;enhanced&quot; commemorative CD re-release plus a DVD featuring an edited version of the tour that accompanied the album (the full concert was originally released on VHS in 1987). The original album was the first CD made in Australia and, , remains the highest-selling album in Australia by an Australian act.

====&quot;Jack&quot; and &quot;The Acoustic Chapel Sessions&quot;====

On 27 May 2009, Farnham announced a new concert tour for September and October, &quot;John Farnham – Live By Demand&quot;.

A new studio album, &quot;Jack&quot;, was released by Sony BMG on 15 October 2010. The album contains 11 tracks and is Farnham&#x27;s first studio album in over 5 years. &quot;Jack&quot; features covers of compositions by Ray Charles, Curtis Mayfield and Percy Sledge. The release of &quot;Jack&quot; coincides with a run of indoor and outdoor performances, under the title of &quot;John Farnham Live!&quot;, throughout October and November 2010.

On 8 June 2011, it was announced that Farnham intended to embark on a nationwide tour of Australia throughout October and November 2011 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the release of the &quot;Whispering Jack&quot; album. In addition to this, the &quot;Whispering Jack Live&quot; video album was edited down by 20 minutes and re-released on DVD by Sony BMG.

On 30 September 2011, Farnham released &quot;The Acoustic Chapel Sessions&quot; live album, recorded in Melbourne in July 2011 at Chapel Off Chapel. The album was released as a CD and DVD 2-disc set by Sony BMG. The CD contains eleven previously released Farnham songs recorded acoustically, while the DVD includes eight songs plus interviews with Farnham and the band as well as additional behind-the-scenes footage.

====Olympics, the Seekers and Olivia Newton-John tours====
On 27 July 2012, Farnham performed live for the Australian Olympic team in London during the lead up to the 2012 Olympic Games. He performed a number of his best-known songs, including &quot;Playing To Win&quot;, &quot;Pressure Down&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re The Voice&quot;. He appeared in a special one-off show with the Seekers in 2014 as part of the &quot;Decades Festival&quot; commemorating the music, fashion and cars of specific era and coinciding with the Seekers&#x27; golden jubilee year.

In 2015, Farnham joined Olivia Newton-John on stage with a concert tour entitled &quot;Two Strong Hearts Live&quot;, singing hits from Newton John&#x27;s film &quot;Grease&quot;, iconic Farnham numbers and renditions of popular classics such as &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Tenterfield Saddler&quot;. An album was released in June 2015 and debuted at No. 1.

==Band==
, John Farnham&#x27;s band members were musical director and keyboardist Chong Lim, Angus Burchall on drums, Brett Garsed on guitar, and Craig Newman on bass guitar. Backing vocalists are Lindsay Field, Lisa Edwards, Susie Ahern, and Rod Davies. Previously prominent long-serving members have included Venetta Fields and Stuart Fraser, from the band Noiseworks who regularly performed and toured with the band from 1992 until 2018 when his health deteriorated due to lung cancer. Fraser died on 1 December 2019.

==Use of his music==
In 2015, Farnham and Wheatley spoke out against the use of his iconic signature song, &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot;, being used by Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islamic group, and again in 2020 in regard to its use at anti-lockdown rallies during the stage 4 COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Victoria, which Wheatley described as offensive to Farnham.

From 3 September 2023, with Farnham&#x27;s support, &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot; was used to advocate for the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, a vote to change the Australian Constitution to enshrine a Voice to Parliament for Indigenous Australians. The song plays as a soundtrack for a video ad directed by filmmaker Warwick Thornton, which was rolled out on social and other digital media and television. On 10 October 2023, Farnham was one of 25 Australians of the Year who signed an open letter supporting the Yes vote.

==Other activities==
Farnham has supported several charities over the years, including headlining the 2019 Hay Mate series of concert for Australia&#x27;s farming community, which raised over 4.4 million dollars.

==Recognition and awards==

Farnham has won and been nominated for numerous Australian music and entertainment awards. These include 21 ARIA Awards from 60 nominations including his induction into their Hall of Fame. Others are &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards, Mo Awards and &quot;TV Week&quot; magazine&#x27;s King of Pop Awards and their Logie Awards.

On Australia Day (26 January) 1996, Farnham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia, &quot;In recognition of service to the Australian music industry and to charitable and community organisations, particularly those relating to youth.&quot;

In 2015, Farnham, along with AC/DC, Newton John, the Seekers, and Indigenous Australian artist Archie Roach, was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.

Australian rock historian Ian McFarlane described him as &quot;the most successful solo artist in the history of Australian rock and pop ... Farnham has retained an affable sense of humour and a simple, unpretentious &#x27;everyman&#x27; charm which also makes him one of the most respected celebrities in Australian entertainment history&quot;.

===In film===
Farnham is the subject of a biographical documentary film titled &quot;John Farnham: Finding the Voice&quot;, released in cinemas in May 2023.

==Personal life==
Farnham married Jillian Billman, a dancer he met when performing the stage musical &quot;Charlie Girl&quot;, on 11 April 1973. They have two sons, Robert and James. Farnham is a supporter of the North Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League. He lives on a farm near Bendigo.

===Health ===
After years of performing at high-volume concerts, Farnham has tinnitus and hearing loss, and wears hearing aids.

In 2019, Farnham cancelled an Australian and New Zealand tour due to a severe kidney infection and dehydration. He subsequently gave up a lifetime habit of smoking, and reduced his alcohol intake.

On 23 August 2022, Farnham released a statement that he was to undergo immediate surgery after being diagnosed with cancer. In this statement, he said &quot;cancer diagnosis is something that so many people face every single day, and countless others have walked this path before me.&quot; The same day, he underwent a nearly twelve-hour surgery to remove a tumour in his mouth, including jaw reconstruction. He was transferred to an intensive care unit, in a stable condition. It was later announced that the tumour had been successfully removed. In March 2023, he was hospitalised due to a respiratory infection.

On 23 August 2023, exactly one year after his surgery, Farnham released a statement saying he was cancer-free, and in an interview with Variety Australia published on 5 September 2023, when asked if Farnham will ever tour again or release new material, his sons said &quot;Anything&#x27;s possible... I think he&#x27;d like to, and he can definitely still sing&quot;.

<text>The Sioux Falls Skyforce are an American professional basketball team of the NBA G League based in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and are affiliated with the Miami Heat. The team has played its home games in the Sanford Pentagon since the 2013–14 season. The Sioux Falls Skyforce are the longest-running minor-league basketball team in the United States.

The Skyforce began in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) in 1989, playing its home games at Sioux Falls Arena from then until the move to the Pentagon in 2013. It participated in four CBA championship finals, winning the championship trophy in 1996 (defeating the Fort Wayne Fury, four games to one) and 2005 (defeating the Rockford Lightning three games to one).

==History==
The team&#x27;s name was chosen from two entries in a contest to name the team in 1989 which yielded 1,045 suggestions. The names &quot;Sky&quot; and &quot;Force&quot; were combined to create the &quot;Skyforce&quot;.

The Skyforce also hosted the CBA All-Star Game three times: in 1996, 2000, and 2003.

In 2006, the Skyforce joined the D-League. In its first two seasons in the D-League, it was a playoff contender. In 2009, the team suffered a 2–1 series loss in the first round to the Tulsa 66ers. In 2014, it fared a bit better, sweeping the Canton Charge in the first round before being swept by the eventual champion Fort Wayne Mad Ants in the semifinals. In 2016, the Skyforce won its first D-League championship, defeating the Los Angeles D-Fenders 2 games to 1. The Skyforce also finished the 2016 season 40–10, the winningest regular season record in D-League history.

On June 10, 2013, the Miami Heat announced that it had entered into a single affiliation partnership with the Skyforce, beginning with the 2013–14 season. The Miami Heat signature red/yellow color scheme was adopted into the Skyforce&#x27;s jerseys, logo, and merchandise following this announcement. On June 1, 2017, the Heat purchased a controlling interest in the Skyforce with the Heineman family retaining its minority share. The former ownership group of Bob Correa, Greg Heineman, Roger Larsen, and Tom Walsh had purchased the Skyforce from the Kemper Lesnik Organization in May 1993.

<text>Paul Archer Tyler, Baron Tyler, (born 29 October 1941) is a Liberal Democrat politician in the United Kingdom. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from February to October 1974 and from 1992 to 2005, and sat in the House of Lords as a life peer until October 2021.

==Education==
He was privately educated at the independent Sherborne School and Exeter College, Oxford.

==Elections==
In 1964 Tyler was elected Britain&#x27;s youngest County Councillor, and re-elected in 1967. He was vice-chairman of the Dartmoor National Park Committee and a member of the Devon &amp; Cornwall Police Authority.

His first Parliamentary candidacy was for Totnes at the 1966 general election, when he came third.

At the 1970 general election, Tyler stood as the Liberal candidate in the Bodmin constituency, defending the seat held by the outgoing Liberal MP Peter Bessell. However, he lost to the Conservative candidate Robert Hicks.

At the February 1974 general election, Tyler defeated Hicks by a majority of only nine votes. At the October election that year, Tyler increased his vote, but not sufficiently to withstand the swing, and Hicks regained the seat with a majority of 665. Tyler stood again at the 1979 general election, but Hicks was re-elected with a large majority, in line with the national swing away from the Liberals and Labour to the Conservatives.

He contested the 1982 Beaconsfield by-election, increasing the Alliance vote and pushing the Labour candidate (Tony Blair) into third place. Tyler did not contest the general elections in 1983 and 1987, but was David Steel&#x27;s campaign organiser in 1983, and was subsequently elected Chairman of the Liberal Party 1983–6; he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1985 Birthday Honours. In addition to his role as Campaign Adviser to Steel, he was a member of the Alliance Planning Group 1986–87, and the Campaign Team led by John Pardoe in the 1987 general election.

He was the Liberal Democrat candidate for Cornwall and Plymouth in the 1989 European Parliament election. He reduced the Conservative majority to 8.7%, cut the Labour share of the vote and gained 68,559 votes – the highest ever Liberal or Liberal Democrat vote at the time and the best result in the whole UK.

After an 18-year absence, he returned to Parliament at the 1992 general election, when he was elected as Liberal Democrat Member for North Cornwall, defeating the Conservative incumbent Gerry Neale, who had defeated John Pardoe in 1979. He was a member of the Liberal Democrats&#x27; shadow cabinet until he retired from the House of Commons at the May 2005 general election. Dan Rogerson was selected by the local Liberal Democrats to succeed him, and held the seat by a majority of 3,176.

==Commons career==
Tyler was appointed Liberal Democrat Spokesman on Rural Affairs, Agriculture and Transport following his election 1992. In 1994/95 he also piloted a review of Transport policy. He gained the Country Life Parliamentarian of the Year Award for his persistent and effective challenging of Agriculture Ministers during the BSE Beef crisis.

Following the 1997 election he was elected Chief Whip by the newly enlarged Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Party. He served on the Modernisation Select Committee, and led Liberal Democrat efforts to make the Commons more effective. As the Foot and Mouth epidemic devastated livestock areas, Party Leader Charles Kennedy appointed Tyler to co-ordinate the response, and work with farming and other organisations, to seek more effective Government action.

Following the 2001 election he was appointed to shadow Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons, with particular responsibility for the reform of Parliament. He led for the party on both the modernisation of the Commons and the reform of the Lords to create a democratic and representative Second Chamber. In 2003 he convened a cross-party group (with Ken Clarke, Robin Cook, Tony Wright and Sir George Young) to examine proposals for Lords reform and publish a draft Bill (&quot;Reforming the House of Lords - Breaking the Deadlock&quot;)

==Peerage==
On 13 May 2005 it was announced that Tyler would be created a life peer, and on 15 June 2005 he was created Baron Tyler, of Linkinhorne, in the County of Cornwall. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Cornwall in February 2006. In March 2014, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

==Role in the House of Lords==
Tyler chaired the Liberal Democrats&#x27; &quot;Better Governance&quot; policy group 2006–07 and piloted its report, &quot;For the people, by the people&quot;, through the Liberal Democrat Conference of September 2007. His Constitutional Renewal Bill was introduced in the House of Lords in 2009.

He was co-chair of the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Party Committee on Political &amp; Constitutional Reform 2005–21. He has worked with allies in all Parties, and in both Houses, to advance the cause of constitutional reform. He convened a cross-party group from within the Joint Committee on the Draft House of Lords Reform Bill to secure majority support for positive recommendations in favour of progress with reform. . With colleagues from other parties, Tyler has contributed extensively to media coverage of this issue. He co-authored a pamphlet &quot;Lords Reform – A Guide for MPs&quot; with other pro-reform parliamentarians, before the Bill received a large majority at second reading in the House of Commons in July 2012.

Following the Committee on Standards in Public Life report on &quot;Political Party Finance&quot; in 2011 he led a cross-party group to prepare a draft Bill to follow up its recommendations (&quot;Funding Democracy&quot; - 2013).

He retired from the House of Lords in October 2021, a week before his 80th birthday, making a widely acclaimed &quot;valedictory speech&quot;, fully assessing the constitutional challenges presented by the Johnson Government.

==Campaigns==
In 2006 Lord Tyler called on Planning Minister, Yvette Cooper to honour the pledges and position of her predecessor, Keith Hill, to keep the Cornish Saint Piran&#x27;s Flag flying across the Cornwall When he was MP for North Cornwall, Tyler led a successful campaign, backed by the local media, to gain reassurances from the Planning Minister that rules which prevent the St Piran&#x27;s flag flying without permission could be ignored by local Councils.

In 2007 Lord Tyler confirmed his support for a Cornish Assembly when he was interviewed by the BBC regarding proposals for a Constitutional Convention.

Between 1992 and 2005, he was Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Organophosphates (OPs), and campaigned about their adverse effects on farmers (through sheep dip), pilots and cabin crew (through contaminated cabin air) and Gulf War veterans (through pesticides used to repel insects). He also led a campaign to uncover the truth behind the Lowermoor Water Poisoning incident, and the ensuing cover-up, which occurred shortly before the Conservative Party privatised the water industry.

In 2004, Tyler started a campaign to stop government departments and agencies making citizens access their services via high-rate “0870” phone numbers. He exposed the Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Agency for raking in over £1m a year in “revenue sharing” arrangements with telephone companies, where callers paid over the odds while waiting to book driving tests and sort out tax discs. The campaign culminated in the creation of “03” low-rate numbers, especially for public services.

For a comprehensive analysis of current challenges to Britain&#x27;s constitutional conventions see Lord Tyler&#x27;s article for the Financial Times dated 16 January 2021 at ft.com/3qoFr0k.

With his wife Nicky (whose original idea inspired the initiative) and colleague Lord Oates he worked with the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunisation (GAVI) to provide Covid vaccines to lower income countries. The resulting donations from UK residents to the GAVI/COVAX programme totalled more than £450,000 in the spring of 2021.

Following the publication of &quot;Can Parliament Take Back Control?&quot; with Sir Nick Harvey in 2023 he worked with Unlock Democracy to incorporate its recommendations, together with others, in a draft consultative paper (&quot;Democratic Integrity White Paper&quot; - 2024).

Experience working the Royal Institute of British Architects (1966–73) and Shelter (1975–76) has given Tyler a special interest in housing and planning policy. He was managing director of the Cornwall Courier local newspaper group, 1976–81, a frequent contributor to a wide range of media, and presenter of BBC South West TV &quot;Discovery&quot; series in 1978. He was a Senior Consultant responsible for political and public issue assignments at Good Relations 1982–92 (for, amongst others, the Countryside Commission, European Year of the Environment and Rural Development Commission).

==Publications==
In 2014, Lord Tyler published &quot;Who Decides?&quot; Combining insightful analysis with a series of stories about his time representing Cornwall, the book draws on the work of former Government Chief Psychologist Edgar Anstey and on the illustrations by Norman Thelwell to his 1962 publication &quot;Committees: How they work and how to work them&quot;. In 2023 He published - with Nick Harvey, former North Devon MP and Coalition Government Minister - &quot;&quot;Can Parliament Take Back Control? - Britain&#x27;s Elective Dictatorship in the Johnson Aftermath&quot;.&quot;

<text>Andrew Guy Tyrie, Baron Tyrie, (born 15 January 1957) is a British politician and former chair of the Competition and Markets Authority. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Chichester from 1997 to 2017. Tyrie was previously a special adviser at HM Treasury and chair of the Treasury Select Committee, having taken up the role on 10 June 2010. He was described by Donald Macintyre of &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2013 as &quot;the most powerful backbencher in the House of Commons&quot;, and by &quot;The Economist&quot; as a liberal conservative.

==Early life==
Tyrie was born at Rochford, Essex, on 15 January 1957. He was educated at Felsted School and Trinity College, Oxford, where he read PPE, graduating in 1979. He then attended the College of Europe in Bruges, where he received a postgraduate Certificate of Advanced European Studies, followed by Wolfson College, Cambridge, where he obtained the degree of MPhil.

Tyrie worked at the group head office of BP from 1981 to 1983. From 1990 to 1991, he was a Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, then a senior economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1992 to 1997. Tyrie contested Houghton and Washington in 1992.

==Parliamentary career==
===From 1997 to 2010===
Tyrie was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Chichester at the 1997 general election when Labour returned to government. Following the Conservative Party&#x27;s second defeat to Labour at the 2001 general election, William Hague announced that he would stand down from the leadership role; Tyrie became Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s campaign manager in the following leadership election. Clarke was successful in the final ballot of MPs, but was defeated by Iain Duncan Smith in the full membership vote. Tyrie refused to join the new leader&#x27;s shadow cabinet due to ideological differences.

After Michael Howard succeeded Duncan Smith as Conservative leader, Tyrie served in his Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury between November 2003 and March 2004 and then as Shadow Paymaster General between March 2004 and May 2005.

In 2005, he became Founding Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition, a group of politicians in the British Parliament which examines the issue of extraordinary rendition and related issues. He has been a member of the Public Accounts Commission since 1997 and served on the 1922 Committee Executive between 2005 and 2006.

The Conservatives&#x27; third consecutive defeat following the 2005 election led Michael Howard to announce his resignation as party leader, triggering a leadership contest. Tyrie managed Ken Clarke&#x27;s campaign, but was again unsuccessful – Clarke was eliminated in the first ballot. David Cameron went on to be elected leader. Tyrie did not join the shadow cabinet.

Tyrie is also a Council Member of the Centre for Policy Studies. He is a shareholder of the Veritas Asian Fund and Falcon Land Limited, and he sits on the Board of Directors of Rugby Estates. In his constituency, Tyrie has been involved locally, namely in supporting campaigns including the movement to prevent the Accident and Emergency Department at St Richard&#x27;s Hospital from being downgraded.

===Since 2010===
On 10 June 2010, Tyrie was elected to chair the Treasury Select Committee, defeating original favourite Michael Fallon to succeed John McFall. He was returned unopposed to the Treasury Select Committee chairmanship following the 2015 general election. Tyrie also represents the United Kingdom in the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; speculated in 2012: &quot;One possible reason why Mr Tyrie is still on the backbenches is that he irritated David Cameron by challenging his climate change policies. Mr Cameron did not ask him to become a Minister following the 2010 election and his nickname in senior Tory circles is &#x27;Andrew Tiresome.&#x27;&quot;

In December 2015, Tyrie rebelled against the Cameron government by opposing its motion to join the US-coalition in carrying out airstrikes against ISIS. In the following month, at a meeting of the Liaison Committee, which he chaired, Tyrie clashed with Cameron over the Prime Minister&#x27;s refusal to release details regarding the UK&#x27;s involvement in the Syrian civil war. At one point, Cameron exclaimed to Tyrie: &quot;You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about&quot;. Tyrie&#x27;s questioning during the January 2016 session of the committee was described in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;one-man opposition&quot;. Tyrie, like Cameron, is a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

Tyrie was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 EU membership referendum.

===Select committees===

He has been a member of House of Commons select committees, including:
* 1997–2001 Joint Committee on Consolidation, &amp;c., Bills
* 1997–2001 Public Administration Select Committee 
* 2001–03 Treasury Select Committee
* 2001–04 Treasury Sub-Committee
* 2005–10 Constitutional Affairs Committee
* 2006 Joint Committee on Conventions
* 2009–10 Reform of the House of Commons Committee
* 2009–17 Joint Committee on Tax Law Rewrite Bills 
* 2009–17 Treasury Select Committee
* 2010–17 Liaison Committee
* 2012–17 Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards 
==Post-parliamentary career==

Tyrie stood down as a Member of Parliament in 2017, deciding not to stand as a candidate in the snap general election.

In April 2018, he was confirmed as the next Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority. In June 2020, Tyrie&#x27;s departure from the role was announced, taking effect in September. It was reported that he had become frustrated by the limitations of the role. However it was later speculated that Tyrie had been forced to stand down by CMA board members who had opposed his reformist agenda.

Tyrie was created a Life Peer on 12 June 2018, taking the title Baron Tyrie, of Chichester in the County of West Sussex. He decided to sit in the House of Lords as a non-affiliated peer due to his role at the independent CMA.

<text>Lynette Alice &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme ( ; born October 22, 1948) is an American woman who was a member of the Manson Family, a cult led by Charles Manson. Though not involved in the Tate–LaBianca murders for which the Manson family is best known, she attempted to assassinate US President Gerald Ford in 1975. For that crime, she was sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled from prison on August 14, 2009, after serving approximately 34 years. She published a book about her life in 2018.

==Early life==
Fromme was born on October 22, 1948, in Santa Monica, California, the daughter of Helen (née Benzinger) and William Millar Fromme, an aeronautical engineer. As a child, Fromme performed with a popular dance group called the Westchester Lariats, which began touring the United States and Europe in the late 1950s. She and the Lariats made an appearance on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; and at the White House.
In 1963, the family moved to Redondo Beach, and Fromme began using alcohol and drugs. Her grades dropped at Redondo Union High School, but she graduated in 1966. She moved out of her parents&#x27; house for a few months before her father convinced her to enroll at El Camino College. She returned home for two months before her father kicked her out following an argument, rendering her homeless.

==Charles Manson and her involvement with the Manson Family==
By 1967, at the age of 19, Fromme had dropped out of college. She went to Venice Beach after her parents threw her out of her family&#x27;s house. Suffering from depression, she sat on a curb and watched a bus arrive, and Charles Manson exited. Manson stopped and looked at her and said, &quot;Your parents threw you out, didn&#x27;t they?&quot; Fromme immediately decided Manson was a psychic. Manson walked away as Fromme picked up her belongings and followed him. Manson had recently been released from the federal prison at Terminal Island, and Fromme became the second member of what would become the Manson Family.

Fromme found Manson&#x27;s philosophies and attitudes appealing, and the two became friends and traveled together with other young people, including Mary Brunner and Susan Atkins. She lived with the Manson Family at Spahn Ranch where they worked for their keep, and at the Barker Ranch in Death Valley, which was owned by the grandmother of one of the Family members. Ranch owner George Spahn gave her the nickname &quot;Squeaky&quot; because of the sound that she made when he touched her.

Manson and some of his followers were arrested for the Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca murders in 1969, and during the murder trial, Fromme and the remaining members of the Manson Family camped outside the courthouse. Manson and his fellow defendants Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Leslie Van Houten carved Xs into their foreheads, and so did Fromme and her compatriots. They proclaimed Manson&#x27;s innocence and they also preached his apocalyptic philosophy to the news media and anyone else who was willing to listen to them. Fromme was not charged with involvement in the murders but she was convicted of attempting to prevent Manson&#x27;s imprisoned followers from testifying, and she was also convicted of contempt of court when she refused to testify. She was sentenced to serve short jail terms for both offenses.

Fromme and Sandra Good moved into an older attic apartment in downtown Sacramento, because they wanted to be near Manson after he was moved to Folsom Prison. She and Good lived in the third-floor apartment at 1725 P Street in Sacramento ().

Around 1973, Fromme started to write an extensive 600-page book about the Manson Family. It included intricate drawings and photos; other family members had also contributed to it. Fromme sent it to publishers, but she dropped her plan to get it published after she discussed it with Clem Grogan, deciding that the project was too incriminating. The book, titled &quot;Reflexion&quot;, was eventually published in 2018 by the Peasenhall Press.

==Murder in Stockton, California==
Fromme traveled to Stockton in 1972 with , Priscilla Cooper, and Aryan Brotherhood members Michael Monfort and James Craig, in order to follow through with Manson&#x27;s deal with the Brotherhood. This group met James and Lauren Willett at a cabin. In November 1972, Monfort and Craig forced James Willett to dig his own grave and then shot him because he was going to tell the authorities about a series of robberies that they had committed after they were released from prison. His body was found with his hand still sticking out of the ground. The housemates were arrested on suspicion of murder, after which Lauren Willett&#x27;s body was discovered in the basement. She had been shot to death. The Willetts&#x27; eight-month-old daughter, Heidi, was found alive in the house. Fromme was released for lack of evidence.

The Sonoma County coroner&#x27;s office concluded that James Willett was killed sometime in September 1972, although his decapitated body was not found until the beginning of November. He had been buried near Guerneville. On the night of November 11, 1972, the Stockton Police responded to information that a station wagon owned by the Willetts was parked in front of 720 W. Flora St. Sergeant Richard Whiteman forced his way into the house: &quot;All the persons subsequently arrested were in the house except for Fromme. She telephoned the house while police were there, asking to be picked up, and officers obliged, taking her into custody nearby. Police found a quantity of guns and ammunition in the house along with amounts of marijuana and noticed freshly dug earth beneath the building.&quot;

Fromme later told reporters that she had been traveling in California trying to visit &quot;brothers&quot; in jail and to visit Manson. She said that she came to Stockton on November 10 to visit William Goucher, who was in jail on a robbery charge, when Lauren died. When Fromme left the jail after visiting Goucher, she called the house on Flora Street to have someone pick her up, and the Stockton Police traced the call and arrested her at a phone booth.

The Stockton Police exhumed the body of Lauren Willett the following day. Cooper told investigators that she had been shot accidentally, contending that Monfort was &quot;demonstrating the dangers of firearms, playing a form of Russian roulette with a .38 caliber pistol&quot; and had first spun the gun cylinder and shot at his own head, and then pointed it at the victim, when it fired. The police determined that Lauren had been with them voluntarily. Fromme was held in custody for 2½ months but never charged; she said she was innocent of any wrongdoing. The other four people who were involved were convicted.

After leaving Stockton, Fromme moved into a Sacramento apartment with Sandra Good. The two wore robes on occasion and they changed their names to symbolize their devotion to Manson&#x27;s new religion, Fromme becoming &quot;Red&quot; in honor of her red hair and the California redwoods, and Good becoming &quot;Blue&quot; for her blue eyes and the ocean; both nicknames were originally given to them by Manson.

==Attempt to contact Jimmy Page==
Prior to a Led Zeppelin concert in Long Beach in 1975, Fromme knocked on the hotel door of Danny Goldberg, vice president of the band&#x27;s record label, Swan Song Records. Fromme, described as frantic and with a nervous tic marring her face, asked to meet with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page to warn him, claiming to have foreseen the future and wishing to warn Page of imminent &quot;evil&quot; which she believed might take place that night at the concert. Goldberg stated that she could not see Page until the following night, to which Fromme responded &quot;tomorrow night will probably be too late&quot;. After a long discussion, Goldberg agreed to deliver a message to Page if she wrote it down. Fromme was subsequently escorted away against her will and the note was ultimately burned and never read. Goldberg later saw Fromme on the television news after she had attempted to assassinate President Gerald Ford.

==Assassination attempt on President Ford==

On the morning of September 5, 1975, Fromme went to Sacramento&#x27;s Capitol Park, ostensibly to plead with President Gerald Ford about the plight of the California redwoods, dressed in a red robe and armed with a Colt M1911 .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol. The pistol&#x27;s magazine was loaded with four rounds, but there was no round in the chamber. When Fromme pointed the gun at Ford she was immediately restrained by Secret Service agent Larry Buendorf. As she was apprehended, she reportedly yelled &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t go off&quot; and said &quot;it didn&#x27;t go off. Can you believe it? It didn&#x27;t go off&quot; when brought to the ground by Buendorf. In 1980, Fromme told &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; that she had deliberately ejected the round from her weapon&#x27;s chamber before leaving home that morning, and investigators later found a round on her bathroom floor.

Fromme refused to cooperate with her own defense during her trial. Despite claiming that &quot;I was not determined to kill the guy&quot;, Fromme was convicted of the attempted assassination of the president and received a life sentence under a 1965 law that made attempted presidential assassinations a federal crime. After U.S. Attorney Dwayne Keyes recommended severe punishment because she was &quot;full of hate and violence&quot;; Fromme threw an apple at him, hitting him in the face and knocking off his glasses. She told the press that she &quot;came to get life. Not just my life but clean air, healthy water, and respect for creatures and creation.&quot;

===Aftermath===
In 1979, Fromme was transferred out of Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin, California, for attacking fellow inmate Julienne Bušić with a hammer. On December 23, 1987, she escaped from Federal Prison Camp Alderson in West Virginia in an attempt to meet Manson. She was captured two days later and incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, in Fort Worth, Texas.

Fromme continued to profess total allegiance to Manson. Vincent Bugliosi wrote in &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; that she and Good were the only members of the Manson Family who had not renounced him. She once told an Associated Press reporter, &quot;The curtain is going to come down on all of us, and if we don&#x27;t turn everything over to Charlie immediately, it will be too late.&quot;

Fromme first became eligible for parole in 2005. She waived her right to request a hearing and was required by federal law to complete a parole application before one could be considered and granted. She was granted parole in July 2008, but she was not released because of the extra time which was added to her sentence because of her escape from prison in 1987.

She was released on parole from the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, on August 14, 2009, and she moved to Marcy, New York, where she and her boyfriend Robert Valdner live in a house which is decorated with skulls. In a 2019 televised interview, Fromme said the following about Manson, &quot;Was I in love with Charlie? Yeah, [...] I still am.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* In 1975, Fromme was portrayed by Laraine Newman on the third ever episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in a skit titled &quot;Dangerous but Inept&quot;, in which she is interviewed on a talk show with that title by its host, Jane Curtin.
* Fromme is a character in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Assassins&quot; (1990), a musical about nine people who attempted to assassinate a U.S. president.

<text>Martin John Salter (born 19 April 1954) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament for Reading West from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life and career==

Born to Ray and Naomi Salter in Hampton, Middlesex, he received a grammar school education before attending the University of Sussex, though he left before gaining a degree, saying &#x27;academic life was not for him – &quot;I wanted to do politics, not study it&quot;&#x27;. Both his parents were active trade unionists, and grandfather George Baker was sent to Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1917 as a First World War conscientious objector. He cites his politics teacher from the age of 14 for developing his political interest, when he took him to the Politics Society in Kingston to hear Tony Benn speak, saying that his teacher &#x27;spotted something in me, a real interest&#x27;.

Starting in 1975, Salter began employment in the construction and transport industries, holding various jobs from a labourer to a cargo handler. During this time, he was an active member in the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, and served as a shop steward tasked with &#x27;negotiating working conditions and wages&#x27;. He moved to Reading in 1980, and in 1982 he switched his employment focus by being hired by Reading Borough Council to organise community-based playschemes for children, followed by a move in 1984 to become the co-ordinator of Reading Centre for the Unemployed. Dropping that role in 1987, Salter would thereafter work for Co-op Home Services until 1996, first becoming the development officer then the regional manager.

==Political career==
Joining the Labour Party when he was 17, Salter became the secretary of his local residents&#x27; association in 1980, a post he held until 1984. The council, then under Conservative control, had cut the holiday playscheme budget, and Salter campaigned to undo the changes, the success of which he cites as the reason for his decision to stand for the council. He won election in Park ward in May 1984. Two years later, Labour gained control of the council and Salter was appointed chair of the leisure committee, and a year later became Deputy Leader of the Council, in which role he says he helped &#x27;plan the successful development of the town centre and steered Labour to unprecedented local electoral success&#x27;. He first stood as a candidate for Parliament at the 1987 general election in Reading East. Alleging some of his opponents were carpetbaggers, Salter ran under the motto of &#x27;Martin Salter Lives Here&#x27;, and he came a close third to the SDP (Alliance) candidate .

Salter was selected as his party&#x27;s candidate in Reading West for the 1997 general election, and he stood down from the council in 1996 to concentrate on the campaign. Incumbent Conservative MP Tony Durant had a majority of well over 10,000 from the 1992 general election, but his decision to stand down left the seat more in play. In the end, Salter gained the seat with a majority of around 3,000 against former MP Nicholas Bennett.

On 30 November 2005, Salter resigned as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Schools Minister Jacqui Smith over school reform proposals and co-authored the Alternative Education White Paper with a group of centre-left MPs including John Denham, Angela Eagle, Joan Ruddock and Alan Whitehead. In June 2007, he was appointed as vice-chair (Environment) of the Labour Party.

On 10 February 2009, Salter announced that he would be standing down from the Commons at the next general election.

===Angling activism===
After leaving Parliament in 2010 Salter took a sabbatical in Australia, where he produced an influential report entitled &#x27;Keep Australia Fishing&#x27;. In 2011 Salter took a part-time position with the Angling Trust as its National Campaigns Coordinator, and currently serves as the Trust&#x27;s Chief Policy Advisor.

===Extreme pornography legislation===
Salter has promoted legislation proposing to criminalise possession of so-called &quot;extreme pornography&quot;. His campaign came about after the conviction at Lewes Crown Court of Graham Coutts, for the murder of Brighton schoolteacher Jane Longhurst. A petition, objecting to &quot;the presence of extreme Internet sites promoting violence against women in the name of sexual gratification&quot;, gained 50,000 signatures.

==Personal life==
He is married to Natalie.

<text>Adrian Mark Sanders (born 25 April 1959) is a Liberal Democrat politician in the United Kingdom. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Torbay in Devon from 1997 until his defeat in the 2015 general election.

==Early life==

Sanders is the son of the late John and Helen Sanders, an insurance official and nurse respectively. He went to primary schools in Paignton and Torquay then Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School. He worked briefly in a timber yard, then in the insurance industry for seven years, and then had a short spell of unemployment before finding work in the political arena.

==Political career==
Sanders joined the Liberal Party in 1979 and in 1985 was elected vice president of the National League of Young Liberals. He was a Torbay Borough councillor 1984–86. From 1986 to 1989 he lived in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, working for the Association of Liberal Democrat Councilors before moving back to Paignton in 1990.

During 1992-93, Sanders worked in the office of Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, and organised the &#x27;Beyond Westminster&#x27; Tour. He then moved to become a policy officer at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (1993–94) and then the Southern Association of Voluntary Action Groups for Europe.

Sanders stood unsuccessfully for the seat of Torbay 1992 general election, reducing the Conservative majority from 8,820 to 5,787. In the 1994 European Election, he unsuccessfully stood for the Devon and East Plymouth constituency, the loss was partly blamed on one of the candidates, Richard Huggett, standing with the description &#x27;Literal&#x27; Democrat.

At the 1997 general election, Sanders stood in Torbay, successfully, defeating the Conservative incumbent Rupert Allason by 12 votes. At the 2001 general election, his majority was 6,708; at the 2005 general election, it was 2,029 and it was 4,078 at the 2010 general election.

Following the 2001 election, Sanders was made the Liberal Democrat spokesman for tourism, and was subsequently moved to the position of Deputy Chief Whip of the Party in Parliament.
In the 2006 leadership contest Sanders nominated Menzies Campbell. In the December 2007 leadership election Sanders remained neutral by not publicly backing any candidate, citing his position as Deputy Chief Whip. He wrote afterwards that he had voted for Chris Huhne.

Sanders was awarded the Diabetes UK 75th Anniversary Award at a ceremony in the House of Commons on Wednesday 21 January 2009. In July 2010, he received the League Against Cruel Sports’ Parliamentarian of the Year Award.

In April 2009, Sanders appeared in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; list of best value MPs. At the height of the expenses scandal, he opened his complete &#x27;unredacted&#x27; expenses file to his local newspaper, the &quot;Herald Express&quot;.

In October 2011, he voted for a backbench motion to hold a referendum on Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Union, along with 110 other MPs in the House of Commons. He was the only Liberal Democrat MP to do so. Sanders said he was also probably the only supporter of the EU to do so, but believed it was &quot;a liberal principle to trust the people&quot;

In May 2012, Sanders was the one Liberal Democrat on the Commons culture, media and sport select committee on phone hacking and provided the swing vote on the release of a report. Sanders joined with the five Labour committee members and against the four Conservative members to support the report which said in part that Rupert Murdoch was &quot;&#x27;not fit&#x27; to run an international company&quot;.

In March 2015, Queen guitarist Brian May launched the &quot;Common Decency&quot; campaign, naming Sanders alongside six other candidates, saying: &quot;We think you’re decent people, we think you represent your constituents and your conscience so we’re going to tell our people to try and cluster round and give you support.&quot;

At the 2015 general election, Sanders lost his seat to the Conservative Party candidate Kevin Foster by a majority of 3,286.

On 5 November 2015, Sanders was elected as the Liberal Democrat councillor for the Clifton-with-Maidenway ward of Paignton, taking almost 70 per cent of the vote.

==Personal life==

Sanders is married to Alison and lives in Paignton. He has had Type 1 diabetes since 1990 and campaigns on issues relating to diabetes. He is a fan of rock music, and occasionally presents a rock show on local radio station &quot;Palm 105.5&quot;. He is also a supporter of Torquay United.

<text>Malcolm Kemp Savidge (born 9 May 1946 in Surrey, England) is a politician in the United Kingdom. He was Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen North, in Scotland, from the 1997 general election until he stood down at the 2005 general election.

==Early life==
Educated at Wallington County Grammar School and then Aberdeen University, he was previously a maths teacher for 24 years and was a member of Aberdeen District Council. In 1991, he unsuccessfully contested the Kincardine and Deeside by-election, where he finished in fourth place, and he was defeated again fighting the same seat at the general election the following year.

==Parliamentary career==
He was elected for Aberdeen North in 1997, with a 47.9% share of the vote and a majority of 10,010 votes over Brian Adam of the SNP.

The Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003 was the result of a Private Member&#x27;s Bill raised by Savidge during 2003. The Act extended to Scotland the rights enjoyed by shopworkers in England and Wales to refuse to work on a Sunday.

When the number of Parliamentary constituencies in Scotland was reduced for the 2005 general election, the former Aberdeen Central constituency was mostly absorbed into an expanded Aberdeen North. The Aberdeen Central MP Frank Doran was selected as the Labour candidate for Aberdeen North, and Savidge did not contest the 2005 general election.

==After Parliament==
Since leaving Westminster he has been a member of the British American Security Information Council , and has been a consultant to the Oxford Research Group.

<text>Jonathan Sayeed (born 20 March 1948) is an Anglo-Indian British politician who was a Conservative Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom from 1983 to 1992 and from 1997 to 2005.

He was the only member of the Conservative front bench who consistently, openly and publicly opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Though he was reselected by the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association to contest his seat in the House of Commons shortly before the 2005 general election, he was forced to retire owing to ill health.

He was criticised by the Committee on Standards and Privileges for being &quot;at the least careless, at the worst negligent&quot; in respect of a company in which he had an interest, but no evidence was found that he had directly received any improper payments. In the investigation by Sir Thomas Legg into MPs&#x27; expenses, he was one of the minority of MPs who were completely cleared of any misuse of their second home allowances.

== Early life ==
Jonathan Sayeed is the son of the late M M Sayeed, a chartered electrical engineer from India, and L S Sayeed.

Sayeed was educated at Woolverstone Hall School in Suffolk.

He joined the Royal Navy in 1965, when he was 17. He spent two years at Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and then studied at the Royal Naval Engineering College, Manadon, for a BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. He left the Navy in 1973, at the age of 24.

==Career in business==
After leaving the Royal Navy, Sayeed joined Marks and Spencer PLC as a management trainee. Since 1974 &quot;he worked as a shipping and insurance consultant&quot;, and held directorships in various international companies:
* Founder director, Wade Emerson &amp; Co Ltd 1974–82.
* Chairman and chief executive, Calmady Insurance Services Ltd 1982–83.
* Chairman, Ranelagh Ltd 1992–96.
* Non-executive director, Love Lane Investments Ltd (Holding Company) 1992–96.
* Chairman, Training Division Corporate Services Group PLC 1996–97.
* Chairman Ranelagh International Ltd 2005-
* Chairman Patient Pak Holdings Ltd 2008- Patient Pak Ltd 2008-

==Private life==
Whilst he was MP for Mid Bedfordshire, Sayeed lived in Westminster, and also had a house in Houghton Conquest.

He was a member of the Reform Club and is a member of the Carlton Club. His interests include golf (Secretary, Lords and Commons Golfing Society 2004 and winner, 1998 and 1999, of the Parliamentary Handicap), sailing (Royal Naval Sailing Association and Royal Temple YC), tennis, skiing, classical music (Chairman of the Parliament Choir 2002–2003), books and architecture.

==MP for Bristol East, 1983-1992==
Sayeed was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the Greater London Council before entering Parliament at his first attempt. He was elected MP for Bristol East at the 1983 general election, where he defeated Tony Benn. The constituency was created for that general election, partly from the Bristol South East constituency, where Benn had been MP for much of the previous 32 years. For the Conservatives, this was one of &quot;the three great prizes&quot; of the election, as Benn was said to be &quot;the man they most love to hate&quot;. At the 1987 general election, Sayeed more than doubled his majority.

Due to his election in 1983 he became the first MP of Indian or Asian descent elected since the 1920s, due to his father being Indian and was one of the first ethnic minority MPs elected in the 20th century.

Sayeed served on the select committees for Defence and the Environment; was chairman of the Shipping and Shipbuilding Committee; and deputy chairman of the All-Party Maritime Group. In 1988, he secured an Urban Development Corporation for Bristol despite the opposition of the then Environment Secretary, Nicholas Ridley. Sayeed started to climb the ministerial ladder in 1991, when he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Lord Belstead as Paymaster General. However, in 1992 his career took a step backward when he lost his seat to Labour at the general election.

==Out of Parliament, 1992-97==
In 1996, Sayeed sold his public affairs company, and was appointed chairman of the training division of Corporate Services Group plc. In May 1997, he stood down as chairman after being elected Member of Parliament for Mid Bedfordshire.

==MP for Mid Bedfordshire 1997-2005==
He returned to Parliament as MP for Mid Bedfordshire at the 1997 general election, having defeated the incumbent MP, Sir Nicholas Lyell, the Attorney General, for the nomination, and held the seat until 2005.

===Hague election campaign===
Sayeed&#x27;s offices at 28 Stafford Place were the headquarters for William Hague&#x27;s successful bid to become Conservative leader in 1997.

===Career progress===
Sayeed served on the Broadcasting Select Committee, and was appointed by the Speaker of the House of Commons to the Chairman&#x27;s Panel. This small group of senior MPs comprises chairmen of the Committees that debate legislation.

In the 1999-2000 session of Parliament, Lord Weatherill and Sayeed introduced a private member&#x27;s bill which was passed into law. This was the Census (Amendment) Bill.

Sayeed was chairman of European Standing Committee C, was joint-chairmen (together with Labour MP Bill O&#x27;Brien) of the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs.

Sayeed achieved his first frontbench post in 2001, when he was appointed shadow minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, working under the Shadow Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary, Peter Ainsworth. &quot;Among his first roles has been to lead for the Conservatives on the Home Energy Conservation Bill, for which he declared his party&#x27;s support strongly at Second Reading. In Committee he made plain that this support was entirely conditional upon the continued inclusion of firm targets in the final text.&quot; The Association for the Conservation of Energy (ACE) praised his efforts saying: &quot;In a few months in post Mr Sayeed has proved himself to be a doughty fighter for strong policies backing energy conservation.&quot; Sayeed continued as shadow minister after a reshuffle by the Conservative leader The Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith in July 2002.

===War on terrorism and the Iraq war===
Following the 11 September terrorist attacks against the United States, the UK Parliament was recalled, and a solemn five-hour emergency sitting of the House of Commons debated the crisis. Jonathan Sayeed said that military might alone would not be enough to deal with the problem. &quot;There has to be some understanding why there is such hatred for so many institutions within the United States. Unless we deal with some of the deep-seated causes, then more terrorists will come to the fore.&quot; However, the Prime Minister was adamant that there should be no &quot;moral ambiguity&quot; about the events in the US, that the entitlement to dislike the US could never justify the actions carried out.

In early 2003, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair supported American plans for the invasion of Iraq. British armed forces were deployed to participate in the invasion. The British Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith supported British government policy on this.

:&quot;Every Conservative MP has been instructed by pager message not to voice doubts about a possible war to journalists, but to share them privately with Mr Duncan Smith or the chief whip, David Maclean. Despite this warning, several Tories, including one on the front bench, have openly dissented from the party line. Jonathan Sayeed, a shadow Environment minister, told the Commons last week that he had heard no convincing case for war. &quot;Every television company will broadcast to the world, including the Arab world, harrowing pictures of the human catastrophe that warfare leaves in its wake, and the closer war comes to Baghdad the greater will be the innocent casualties.&quot;&quot;

An article by Sayeed was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 24 January 2003: entitled &quot;An undemocratic war&quot;. He wrote: &quot;I believe that although a war against Iraq may become necessary, I am not convinced that it is necessary now, and that more should be done to avert war.&quot;

Three members of the Conservative front bench and one Conservative whip resigned their posts so that they could vote against the war:
* John Baron - shadow minister for Health
* Humfrey Malins - shadow minister for Home Affairs
* Jonathan Sayeed - shadow minister for Environment
* John Randall - Whip

===Views===
Whilst he was MP for Bristol East, Sayeed called for the establishment of charity-run hostels for the homeless on derelict council land.

Economically, Sayeed was on the right of the Conservative party, opposing British entry into the single European currency. He had strong views on defence. On social matters, he was on the more liberal wing of the party, with the exception of gay rights in the Armed Forces, on which he opposed the lifting of the ban on homosexuals serving. As an MP, he was considered a well informed and thoughtful contributor to debates on foreign policy in the Middle East and on economic, defence and social matters.

Sayeed urged for new roads to regenerate towns and inner-cities. He campaigned against a proposed 17-tonne lorry ban, against illegal sites for travellers, and against &#x27;unnecessary&#x27; development of the Bedfordshire countryside. He successfully persuaded the UK government to propose amendments to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and, despite opposition from the then Secretary of State for the Environment Nicholas Ridley, persuaded the Conservative government to permit an Urban Development Corporation in Bristol. In 2004 he proposed the end of male primogeniture for the British Monarchy though such a principle would not have been applied to the Prince of Wales or Prince William.

===Return to business===

For much of the time when Sayeed was MP for Mid-Bedfordshire, the chairman of the local constituency party was Alexandra Messervy. Messervy also became one of Sayeed&#x27;s part-time paid assistants in the House of Commons. In June 2001 Messervy set up a travel company called The English Manner Ltd. The business of this company was to provide luxury travel holidays to the UK for Americans; the holidays included lessons in English etiquette from members of the English upper classes and access to exclusive events and institutions. Mrs Messervy had a 60% shareholding, Sayeed had 30%, and 10% was owned by Mrs Genie Ford (who ran operations in the US).

In May–June 2003 or 2004, Ashley Green succeeded Alexandra Messervy as the local constituency party chairman.

In summer 2004, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; claimed &quot;The English Manner Ltd charges clients up to £500 per day for access to the Palace of Westminster through Jonathan Sayeed&quot;. This was completely denied by the company, a denial that was supported by evidence. On a number of occasions Sayeed provided entertainment in the House of Commons for individuals (some of whom were long-standing friends of Mr Sayeed) on holidays arranged by The English Manner. However, there is no evidence that Sayeed received any direct financial benefit for this.

There was a meeting of the local constituency party&#x27;s executive council on 13 September 2004 to discuss the allegations in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; article. It is claimed that at the meeting, Messervy announced that a local donor, Martin Randall, had agreed to give the party some £10,000, so long as &quot;Jonathan is still the candidate at the general election.&quot; (Martin Randall was chairman of a double-glazing company called Crystal Clear, to which Sayeed was a consultant.)

The Conservative whip was temporarily suspended from Sayeed from 3 February to 7 March 2005 after the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges recommended that he be suspended from the service of the House for 10 working days. The Committee found that a company in which he had an interest had appeared to derive financial benefit from its offering tours of Parliament and ran the risk of damaging the reputation of Parliament.

Sayeed said that the suspension was &quot;unjust and wrong&quot; but he made an &quot;unreserved&quot; apology to MPs in the Commons chamber: &quot;I accept that a complaint was brought because of ineffectual internal controls in a company in which I had an interest and that as an MP I was negligent in not checking the actions of that company. For that I unreservedly apologise to the House.&quot; He told colleagues he had disposed of his shares in &quot;The English Manner&quot; and resigned as a consultant to it. He said: &quot;I can assure the House that I have never used my access to the House or its facilities for direct or indirect commercial benefit and I have never solicited or received any payment for any tour or entertainment within the Palace of Westminster.&quot;

On 17 February 2005, the Mid-Bedfordshire Conservative Association held a meeting at the Rufus Centre in Flitwick to consider Jonathan Sayeed&#x27;s future. The meeting decided by a majority of 173 to 126, that Sayeed should remain the Conservative candidate in the forthcoming general election. After the vote, Constituency association president Sir Stanley Odell resigned in protest. One constituency party member, Geoffrey Beckwith, said: &quot;I think the membership was strongly against the motion. Mr Sayeed has behaved impeccably. This is just a storm in a teacup. I think the chairman of the party [Ashley Green] might now have to look to his own position.&quot;

On 21 February 2005, the constituency party chairman&#x27;s wife, Mrs Valmai A Green, and another member, wrote to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, enclosing a letter Sayeed had sent to members of the Mid-Bedfordshire Conservative Association, and asking if Sayeed should have used House of Commons stationery and facilities for this. &quot;The Committee issued a second report on 17 March 2005 criticising Sayeed for failing to apologise for his conduct as the first report had ordered, for sending out a circular on House of Commons stationery to members of the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association asking for their support in his reselection, and misuse of allowances to pay for work on his home. Following this report, the Conservative Party removed the whip from Sayeed permanently.&quot; Under Conservative Party rules, a sitting MP can only be an approved party candidate in a parliamentary election if he/she is in receipt of the party whip. This enables the Conservative Party leader to overrule local constituency Conservative Party branches who want to retain their sitting MP as candidate.

In March 2005, Sayeed was criticised by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges for his use of allowances and Parliament&#x27;s stationery. He was ordered to pay back £12,500 which was spent on his Bedfordshire home – the money is allocated for London expenses only. This money was subsequently repaid to Sayeed following his producing the receipts for the correct property. Similarly treated was a further £9,500 in expenses investigated by the Standards and Privileges Committee. In the investigation by Sir Thomas Legg of the validity of payments of the Additional Costs (or &#x27;Second Homes&#x27;) Allowance (ACA) made to Members of Parliament during 2004–05 to 2008-09 Jonathan Sayeed was one of the minority of MPs who were completely cleared of any impropriety or misuse of their allowances.

&quot;On 14 March 2005, it was announced that Jonathan Sayeed would not be contesting the May 2005 general election, on grounds of ill health.&quot;

Jonathan Sayeed was one of two Conservative MPs who had the party whip withdrawn at the time of the election. The other was Howard Flight, who was deselected over comments he made on Conservative spending plans.

== Since 2005 ==
He retired from Parliament at the general election of 2005, and is currently a chairman of various companies. In 2009, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld ten complaints against his company PatientPak, accusing the company&#x27;s marketing campaign of &quot;scaremongering&quot; when advertising its patient hygiene kit as &quot;essential to protect against hospital superbugs&quot;.

On 19 July 2005, the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges concluded that, in making ACA claims in respect of an ineligible property, Mr Sayeed did not properly observe the administrative rules relating to the allowance, and therefore breached the Code of Conduct in this respect. The committee explained this conclusion writing, &quot;We agree with the Commissioner and deplore Mr Sayeed&#x27;s failure to take the steps necessary to satisfy himself that such important matters were being dealt with properly. Had he still been a Member, we would have given serious consideration to a further period of suspension.&quot;

<doc id="450357" wikidata="Q4965250" url="?curid=450357" title="Brian Sedgemore">
<text>Brian Charles John Sedgemore (17 March 1937 – 29 April 2015) was a British politician who served as a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 to 1979, and again from 1983 to 2005. He defected to the Liberal Democrats shortly after standing down from Parliament just before the 2005 general election.

==Early life==
Brian Sedgemore was born in Exmouth, Devon, and with his two siblings was raised by his mother; his father, a stoker in the Royal Navy, died during active service in the Second World War.

He attended Newtown Primary School in Newtown, Exeter, and Hele&#x27;s School, Exeter, a grammar school. He did RAF national service from 1956 to 1958. He read PPE at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and graduated in 1962. While working as a Whitehall civil servant, he trained at night as a barrister specialising in Criminal Law at Middle Temple, London, being called to the bar in 1966. During the 1970s he and fellow barrister David Fingleton contributed pseudonymous articles on politics and the police and criminal justice system to the &quot;Private Eye&quot; column &#x27;Justinian Forthemoney&#x27;. He wrote a number of books including &quot;The Secret Constitution&quot; and a novel, &quot;Power Failure&quot;.

==Parliamentary career==
Sedgemore was first elected to the House of Commons at the February 1974 general election for Luton West, but lost this seat in 1979. In 1976 he voted for Tony Benn, the Energy Secretary, in the Labour leadership election, and during 1978–79 served as Benn&#x27;s Parliamentary Private Secretary, or PPS. Early in 1979 he was forced to resign over a leak of Treasury papers on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism to the Treasury Select Committee. Having lost his seat, he worked as a journalist for Granada Television.

Sedgemore returned to Parliament at the 1983 general election, as the MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, and stood down at the 2005 general election. Sedgemore succeeded Ronald Brown, who had defected from Labour to the Social Democratic Party (SDP), as the member for Shoreditch.

===Europe===
Initially, he was a member of the (now Socialist) Campaign Group, but he left the faction when he reversed his hostility to the (then) European Communities in the late 1980s. He was later one of only five Labour MPs to vote for the Third Reading of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, defying his party Whip, which was to abstain.

===Female Labour MPs===
On 6 February 1998, in a controversial speech at the Tate Gallery (now Tate Britain), he disparaged the 1997 intake of female Labour MPs as &quot;Stepford Wives…who&#x27;ve had the chip inserted into their brain to keep them on message and who collectively put down women and children in the vote on lone parent benefits&quot; — in the previous month benefits had been reduced for this group of (mainly) women. In the 2001–2005 parliament he was the fifth-most frequent rebel on the Labour benches in divisions on government motions, and the tenth-most frequent rebel on motions put forward by his own party.

===Defection===
On 25 April 2005, when he was no longer an MP during the run-up to the 2005 general election, he announced he would be defecting to the Liberal Democrats, citing the invasion of Iraq – of which he had been a long-term critic – university tuition fees and anti-terrorism laws as reasons for his defection and Blair&#x27;s &quot;scorn for liberal Britain&quot;. He made various comments about Tony Blair being a liar; Blair responded on a live BBC television broadcast, saying &quot;He was not present at any meeting I had with George Bush and I don&#x27;t remember having any conversation on the issue with Brian Sedgemore&quot;. Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy called Sedgemore&#x27;s defection &quot;a pivotal moment&quot; in the election campaign.

==Personal life==

<text>The Salt Lake City Stars are an American minor-league professional basketball team. They are a member of the NBA G League, based in West Valley City, Utah, and are affiliated with the Utah Jazz. Before the 2016–17 season, they were based in Boise, Idaho. Their home arena is the Maverik Center.

==History==

===Idaho Stampede===
The team was founded as a member of the Continental Basketball Association in 1997 and was league runner-up in the 2003–04 season, losing to the Dakota Wizards. After the 2005–06 season, the Stampede announced that the team would be joining the NBA Development League. From 2005 to 2015, the team played as the Idaho Stampede at the CenturyLink Arena in Boise. Before then, they played home games at the Ford Idaho Center in Nampa. The Stampede&#x27;s sole NBA affiliate is the Utah Jazz, with whom they originally had a hybrid partnership. However, on March 24, 2015, the Utah Jazz and the Idaho Stampede announced that the Jazz had purchased the Stampede, becoming the 8th NBA team to become owners of their D-League affiliate. They also had past affiliations with the Denver Nuggets, Seattle SuperSonics, Toronto Raptors and most recently the Portland Trail Blazers, with the Jazz taking sole affiliation after the 2013–2014 season.

===Move to Salt Lake City===
The team was purchased by the Jazz on March 24, 2015, and signed a one-year lease at CenturyLink Arena. Shortly after the Jazz bought the Stampede, rumors abounded about the team&#x27;s relocation to Orem, Utah to be closer to the parent club; coincidentally, Orem was home to the D-League&#x27;s Utah Flash from 2007 until 2011 (the team now plays in Wilmington, Delaware as the Delaware Blue Coats). These rumors were not far off, as on April 4, 2016, the Utah Jazz and the D-League announced that the Stampede would relocate to Salt Lake City for the 2016–17 season and would be renamed the Salt Lake City Stars. The Stars would play at the Bruin Arena at Salt Lake Community College in Taylorsville, Utah for five seasons.

On October 10, 2022, it was announced that the team will be moving into the Maverik Center as their home arena beginning with the 2022–2023 season.

<text>Andrew Edmund Armstrong Selous (; born 27 April 1962) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for South West Bedfordshire from 2001 until 2024, when the constituency was abolished. Selous stood for the new Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard constituency however the seat was won by the Labour candidate Alex Mayer. Selous lives in Studham in the constituency of Luton South.

A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Minister of State for Prisons from 2014 to 2016 in the government of Prime Minister David Cameron.

==Early life==
Selous was born in Marylebone to Gerald and Mary Selous (&quot;née&quot; Casey). He was privately educated both at West Downs School and Eton College. He then studied at the London School of Economics, receiving a BSc in Industry and Trade in 1984.

In 1981, Selous joined the Honourable Artillery Company as a soldier. On 1 October 1989, he was commissioned in the Queen&#x27;s Division, Territorial Army, as a second lieutenant (on probation); he then served with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 October 1991. He was transferred to the London Regiment on 20 April 1993. He moved to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers in January 1996, thereby ending his active service. 

From 1988 until 1994, he was a director of his family firm CNS Electronics (now CNS Farnell). Then, from 1991 until 2001, he was an underwriter at Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK) PLC.

==Parliamentary career==
Selous was first elected to the House of Commons in 2001, and had previously contested the Sunderland North seat in 1997. He is a director and prominent member of the Conservative Christian Fellowship.

In 2006, Selous was promoted to Shadow Minister for Work and Pensions.

In the Coalition government, he was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, from 28 May 2010 to 16 July 2014. On 16 July 2014, he was appointed as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for Prisons and Probation and retained this role following the 2015 general election. However he was asked to step down from the government by Theresa May after she became Prime Minister in July 2016.

He attracted criticism in 2014 for reportedly stating at a Centre for Social Justice fringe meeting that &quot;disabled people work harder because they&#x27;re grateful to have a job&quot;. Selous subsequently said that he had simply been trying to convey the message that disabled people were valued by employers, and his observation that disabled people often work harder was supported by a spokesperson for Disability Rights UK.

Selous chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Strengthening Couple Relationships, and argues that cross-party efforts to prevent family breakdown can relieve pressure on the care system.
He was opposed to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, arguing that it was directly contrary to what Jesus said.

He served as Second Church Estates Commissioner, responsible for representing the Church Commissioners in Parliament and in the General Synod of the Church of England, from 2020 to 2024.

<text>Jonathan Rowland Shaw (born 3 June 1966) is a British Labour Party politician who served as the member of parliament for Chatham and Aylesford from 1997 to 2010. He also served in the Government as the minister for disabled people from 2008 to 2010. He was the CEO of Policy Connect and currently serves on the board. He chairs the Blackthorn Trust.

==Early life==
Shaw was educated at Vinters Boys&#x27; School, West Kent College and Bromley College.

==Parliamentary career==
A former member of Rochester-upon-Medway City Council, Shaw was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election; which resulted in a nationwide landslide for the Labour Party. He was re-elected in 2001, with a majority of 4,340 votes and again in 2005; with a reduced majority of 2,332 votes.

Shaw served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ruth Kelly as secretary of state for education and skills in 2005–06. He was also an assistant government whip in 2006–07, prior to joining The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as minister for Fisheries.

Shaw served as a member of the Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee (1997–2001), and the Education and Skills Select Committee (2001–05). In July 2007, Shaw was appointed minister for the South East of England.

Following a cabinet reshuffle in October 2008, Shaw was moved to the DWP, becoming a parliamentary under-secretary of state for work and pensions, and minister for disabled people, replacing Anne McGuire, while retaining his position as minister for the South East.

Shaw lost his seat at the 2010 general election to Tracey Crouch of the Conservative Party. On the BBC &quot;Politics Show&quot; South East in July 2010, he said that he had withdrawn from public life. Shaw went on to be the chief executive of Policy Connect, an independent, cross-party not-for-profit social enterprise with two decades in policy work.

== Personal life ==
While an MP, Shaw lived in Snodland in his constituency.

<text>Barry John Sheerman (born 17 August 1940) is a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Huddersfield, previously Huddersfield East, for 45 years from 1979 to 2024. A member of the Labour and Co-operative parties, he is one of the longest serving MPs in recent history.

==Early life==
Sheerman was born on 17 August 1940 in Sunbury-on-Thames, Middlesex, and went to Hampton Grammar School (which became the independent Hampton School in 1975) on Hanworth Road in Hampton, then to Kingston Technical College.

He graduated from the London School of Economics (BSc Economics 1965) and from the University of London (MSc 1967). He became a lecturer at the University of Wales, Swansea, in 1966 and remained there until his election to parliament in 1979.

==Parliamentary career==
Sheerman unsuccessfully contested Taunton at the October 1974 election. He became the MP for Huddersfield East from 1979 to 1983 and for Huddersfield since the 1983 general election, holding the seat since then, with a majority as low as 3,955 in 1983 and as high as 15,848 at the 1997 general election. At the most recent general election, in 2019, Sheerman&#x27;s majority fell to 4,937 with a swing of 7.8% to the Conservatives, in line with many other seats in Yorkshire.

As the shadow Employment and Training minister from 1983 to 1988, he was the opposition spokesperson for post-16 education in both the education and employment teams. He served as a shadow Home Affairs minister from 1988 to 1992, focusing on police, prisons and probation as the deputy to Roy Hattersley, the Shadow Home Secretary. Following John Smith&#x27;s election as Labour leader, Sheerman served as the shadow Disabled People&#x27;s Rights minister from 1992 to 1994. 

He chaired the House of Commons Education and Skills select committee from 2001 to 2007, and remained chair of the renamed Children, Schools and Families Select Committee from 2007 to 2010. Under his chairmanship, the committee was often critical of government policy. Sheerman warned the government not to &quot;lose their nerve&quot; over reforming secondary education exam system back in 2005, and in 2006 said it was &quot;naive&quot; to allocate local school places through parental choice, with lottery selection being the best way to avoid &quot;bloody awful&quot; schools existing as a side effect of parents pushing for their children to study elsewhere. During Sheerman&#x27;s chairmanship, the select committee produced reports on subjects such as home education, education outside the classroom, and young people not in education employment or training (NEETs).

He is Chair of the Labour Forum for Criminal Justice and of the Cross-Party Advisory Group on Preparation for European Monetary Union. Outside parliament, he is Chair of the National Educational Research and Development Trust, and a trustee of the National Children&#x27;s Centre. His political interests are listed as trade, industry, finance, further education, education, economy, the European Union, South America and the United States.

In June 2009, Sheerman called for a secret ballot of the Parliamentary Labour Party on whether Gordon Brown should continue in office as prime minister. This followed widespread criticism of Brown&#x27;s performance and the resignation of Cabinet member James Purnell. Sheerman later reassured his local party chairman that he had not directly called for Brown&#x27;s resignation.

Sheerman called for a London catering company to employ &quot;English workers&quot; in a Twitter exchange on 23 April 2012. The comments reached the national press. In response, Sheerman said the objection to him speaking out was &quot;pernicious political correctness&quot;.

He is founder and chairman of Policy Connect, a cross-party, not-for-profit based in London, where he regularly chairs seminar events and research inquiries. Sheerman is also chair and co-chair of a number of official All-Party Parliamentary Groups, including the All-Party Parliamentary Carbon Monoxide Group, the All-Party Parliamentary Manufacturing Group, and the Bullying All-Party Group. Since 2012, He has led the Schools to Work Commission, the Labour Party&#x27;s policy review on the transition from education to employment.

In June 2015, Sheerman caused controversy when he argued that lowering the voting age to 16, by reducing childhood, might raise the risk of sexual abuse.

On 5 December 2021, Sheerman announced his intention to stand down at the next election; at the time of the announcement he was the longest-serving Labour MP.

== Political positions ==
Sheerman consistently voted for the Iraq War, and has nearly always voted to block subsequent independent investigations into the war, with the most recent such vote in 2016. He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election. Sheerman supported the UK remaining within the EU in the 2016 membership referendum.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sheerman suggested that &quot;on the spot fines&quot; would increase compliance with mask mandates.

==Personal life==
Barry Sheerman married Pamela Elizabeth Brenchley in 1965 in north Surrey, with whom he has one son (born in 1978) and three daughters (born in 1970, 1972 and 1981). During a Parliamentary Debate in November 2022 he announced the recent birth of his 13th grandchild. His recreations include walking, biography and films.

In 1993, Sheerman co-wrote, with Isaac Kramnick, a biography of the Labour intellectual Harold Laski.

<text>Sir Richard Charles Scrimgeour Shepherd (6 December 1942 – 19 February 2022) was a British politician who was Member of Parliament for Aldridge-Brownhills from 1979 to 2015. A Eurosceptic, Shepherd was one of the Maastricht Rebels that had the whip withdrawn over opposition to Prime Minister John Major&#x27;s legislation on the European Union. Shepherd was also a libertarian Conservative, and had a three line whip imposed against him by Margaret Thatcher when he introduced an amendment to loosen the Official Secrets Act 1911.

== Early life ==
Shepherd was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, to parents who worked in the commercial aviation industry. The family moved to London to be closer to Heathrow Airport, and Shepherd was educated at Isleworth Grammar School (now Isleworth and Syon School). He then went to the London School of Economics where he received a BSc in Economics and where he studied with and became a friend of Robert Kilroy-Silk. He subsequently attended the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in the United States from which he graduated with an MSc which was also in Economics.

In the 1970s, Shepherd established the retail food businesses Partridges of Sloane Street and Shepherd Foods in London, operating both enterprises with his family. He was then an underwriter at Lloyd&#x27;s of London from 1974 to 1994.

== Parliamentary career ==
Shepherd contested the open Conservative candidacy in Heston and Isleworth in 1970, but was not selected. He was chosen as the Conservative candidate for Nottingham East at the February 1974 general election, where he was defeated by the Labour Party candidate Jack Dunnett. During the 1970s he was also an assistant to Teddy Taylor.

Shepherd was elected Member of Parliament for Aldridge-Brownhills in 1979. &quot;The Spectator&quot; variously cited him as &#x27;Backbencher of the Year&#x27; in 1987, &#x27;Troublemaker of the Year&#x27; in 1989, and &#x27;Parliamentarian of the Year&#x27; in 1995. He was rated as one of the ten most effective sitting MPs in 1989. In 2010, ConservativeHome listed him as one of the most rebellious Tory MPs. 

One of the most significant events in Shepherd&#x27;s parliamentary career came in 1988 when he introduced his Protection of Official Information Bill, which was to replace parts of the Official Secrets Act 1911, with intent to provide limited protection to some whistleblowers. The government introduced a three line whip which called on its MPs to vote against the bill, even though it was introduced by a member of their own party. This brought considerable debate at the time both in parliament and in the media. The bill was defeated. However Shepherd successfully introduced similar provisions into law in 1998.

Shepherd was one of the Maastricht Rebels, and is known to have had libertarian leanings. He developed close ties with fellow Maastricht rebels Nicholas Budgen and Christopher Gill, and gave the eulogy at Budgen&#x27;s funeral.

Shepherd was a strong advocate of Parliament&#x27;s power to hold the government to account. Shepherd stood to be Speaker of the House of Commons in 2000, and won 136 votes: the third-closest to defeating Michael Martin of eleven opponents. When Martin was forced to resign, in 2009, he stood for the position again. An outsider, at 14/1, he won only 15 votes, and was eliminated on the first ballot.

He voted against the Cameron–Clegg coalition government in 2013 on the issue of British military intervention in the Syrian civil war.

Shepherd was knighted in the 2013 New Year Honours for public service. He retired from Parliament at the 2015 general election.

==Personal life and death==
Shepherd never married. He died on 19 February 2022 at the age of 79.

<text>Debra Ann Shipley (born 22 June 1957) is a politician in the United Kingdom. She was Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Stourbridge from 1997 until the 2005 general election, when she stood down for reasons of ill health. She was succeeded by Lynda Waltho, also from the Labour Party.

Shipley was the first woman MP for Stourbridge, but not the first Labour MP to sit for the town under different boundaries: Wilfred Wellock had been the Labour MP from 1927 to 1931 (for Stourbridge); Arthur Moyle from 1945 to 1950 (Stourbridge); George Wigg from 1950 to 1968 (for Dudley, which was lost to the Tories in a by-election in 1968 following Wigg&#x27;s ill-health and appointment to the National Horseracing Board), and John Gilbert from 1970 to 1974 (for Dudley, as Labour regained Dudley at the 1970 general election).

Following Shipley&#x27;s departure from Parliament in 2005, she later left the Labour Party, and in 2019 campaigned for Change UK in Norfolk.

==Parliament==
Shipley was selected to stand for election for Labour through an all-women shortlist. As an MP, Shipley&#x27;s most significant initiative was the Protection of Children Act, which passed with cross-party support, it requires that childcare organizations now check new staff against a newly created registry of child abusers. Shipley was also responsible for the Children&#x27;s Food Bill, which called for the removal of &quot;unhealthy&quot; food from school vending machines and improvements to school meals. The latter bill attracted the support of celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.

Shipley served on the Culture Media and Sport Select Committee, and was Parliamentary Ambassador to the NSPCC, in which capacity she fronted the &quot;Full Stop&quot; Campaign in Parliament. Shipley generally voted with her party.

<text>Mark Jonathon Mortlock Simmonds (born 12 April 1964) is a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, and was first elected in 2001, succeeding Sir Richard Body. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2010.

In September 2012 he was appointed to the Government as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific. On 11 August 2014 he resigned this post and confirmed that he would step down as an MP at the 2015 general election.

In October 2015, he was appointed non-executive director of the AIM-listed fertiliser company, African Potash. On 6 January 2020, Simmonds was appointed a non-executive director of the AIM-listed African oil exploration company, LEKOIL, a week before the company announced that it had been the victim of a US$184m fraud.

==Early life==
Born in Worksop, Simmonds went to Worksop College, where his father was a House Master, and where his mother also taught, then Trent Polytechnic, where he obtained a BSc (Hons) degree in urban estate surveying in 1986. He became an associate of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 1987. He worked as a surveyor for Savills from 1986 to 1988 and was a partner in Strutt &amp; Parker from 1988 to 1996. He was a director of Hillier Parker from 1997 to 1999 and a chairman of Mortlock Simmonds Brown from 1999 until becoming an MP for Boston and Skegness.

==Parliamentary career==
He contested the Ashfield seat in 1997. Simmonds was promoted to Shadow Health Minister in 2007.

On 5 September 2012, he was appointed as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In this role, he was also responsible for the British Overseas Territories. He resigned on 11 August 2014, claiming that he cannot support his family in London on £120k + expenses. According to the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, although Simmonds legitimately received over £500k from expenses since 2001, changes in the rules following the 2009 United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal meant he was no longer able to claim mortgage relief on a house in Putney. He subsequently sold the house at a profit of £537k and bought Swineshead Abbey but said it was impossible for &quot;a government minister with children to have a normal family life.&quot;

He voted against the Cameron–Clegg coalition government in 2013 on the issue of British military intervention in the Syrian civil war.

Following his decision not to stand again, Simmonds defended charging expenses to the taxpayer purported to total over £10,000 on hoardings and local radio. He claimed the money was necessary to communicate with constituents. The political campaigning website 38 Degrees set up a petition calling for him to pay it back.

In 2014 he was appointed to the Privy Council, entitling him to the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

==Personal life==
He married Lizbeth Hanomancin Garcia in December 1994 in London, and they have two daughters (born March 1999 and October 2000) and a son (born April 2002). He lives in his former constituency in Swineshead in a house on the former site of Swineshead Abbey.

In 2012 he apologised to Parliament for failing to mention an interest in Circle Healthcare when speaking in support of the Health and Social Care Bill in Parliament.

<text>Alexis Bouvard (, 27 June 1767 – 7 June 1843) was a French astronomer. He is particularly noted for his careful observations of the irregularities in the motion of Uranus and his hypothesis of the existence of an eighth planet in the Solar System.

==Life==
Born in Contamines, Duchy of Savoy, Bouvard&#x27;s achievements included the discovery of eight comets and the compilation of astronomical tables of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. While the former two tables were eminently successful, the latter showed substantial discrepancies with subsequent observations. This led Bouvard to hypothesise the existence of an eighth planet responsible for the irregularities in Uranus&#x27; orbit. The position of Neptune was subsequently calculated from Bouvard&#x27;s observations by Urbain Le Verrier after his death.

Bouvard was eventually director of the Paris Observatory after starting there as a student astronomer in 1793 and working under Pierre-Simon Laplace. He died in Paris.

==Honours==
*Member &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; (1803);
*Fellow of the Royal Society (1826);
*Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1828)
*In Australia, a cape known as Cape Bouvard has been named after him when French sailors discovered Western Australia. Bouvard is also a semi-rural residential suburb, while Port Bouvard is a major residential development in the same region. All three are located within the city of Mandurah on the southwest coast of Western Australia.

<doc id="450385" wikidata="Q7533492" url="?curid=450385" title="Siôn Simon">
<text>Siôn Llewelyn Simon (born 23 December 1968) is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Erdington from 2001 to 2010 and as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the West Midlands from 2014 to 2019.

Simon was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further Education from 2008 to 2009 and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Creative Industries from 2009 to 2010. He stood down at the 2010 general election to campaign for a directly elected mayor of Birmingham, with the intent of standing in the first election. In 2014 Simon was elected a Member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands. In 2016 he was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Mayor of the West Midlands but was defeated in the 2017 election by 50.4% to 49.6% of the vote in the final round. In 2019, he lost his seat at the European Parliament election.

==Early life==
Simon was born in Doncaster to Welsh-speaking parents, and was raised in Birmingham, where he lived in Great Barr, Handsworth and Handsworth Wood. His parents were both teachers in Birmingham. He attended Handsworth Grammar School, where he joined the Labour Party at the age of 16. Simon enrolled at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1987, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He was elected President of the college Junior Common Room in his second year.

After university, he was a research assistant for George Robertson MP for three years. He worked for two years in the Guinness management team at Diageo, then a FTSE top 20 company. He then freelanced at speechwriting, policy and advice. His clients included Tony Blair while in opposition, Microsoft UK, the International Duty Free Confederation and various charities and communication companies. He then became a journalist, working for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and the &quot;News of the World&quot;. He was also an associate editor at &quot;The Spectator&quot;. His columns varied from restaurant reviews to politics.

In the 1992 election campaign, Simon ran the European desk for the Labour Party and then, during the 1997 election campaign, the foreign press department at Labour Party headquarters.

==Member of Parliament==
Simon was first elected in the 2001 general election for Birmingham Erdington with a majority of 9,962. He retained the seat in 2005 with a slightly reduced majority of 9,575.

As a backbencher he served on the Public Accounts Committee, Treasury Select Committee, chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Private Equity and Venture Capital and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Business Services.

Shortly after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in July 2007, Simon became Vice-Chair of the Labour Party, with special responsibility to draft the &quot;Law and Order&quot; manifesto for the upcoming 2010 general election.

Following the October 2008 reshuffle, Simon was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further Education in the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In June 2009 he became Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Creative Industries in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

On 3 February 2010 he announced he would not stand for re-election to Parliament, in order to campaign for a directly elected mayor of Birmingham, and stand in a subsequent election. A referendum was held in Birmingham on 3 May 2012, but the proposal was defeated with 57.8% of the vote.

After leaving parliament, Simon founded the website &quot;Labour Uncut&quot; in May 2010. In 2011, he wrote a cover story for &quot;Newsweek&quot; about the August riot disturbances. He also supported HS2 in an article for Progress. He wrote a chapter in &quot;What Next for Labour? Ideas for a new generation&quot; titled &quot;Why Mayors Matter and Why Labour Should Support them&quot;.

==Member of the European Parliament==
Placed second on Labour&#x27;s candidate list, Simon was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands in the 2014 European Parliament elections alongside Neena Gill. In 2014 he joined the European Parliament Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. He lost his seat at the 2019 election.

During the 2016 EU membership referendum vote, Simon participated in the Labour in for Britain pro-EU campaign.

== Mayoral candidate ==
In 2016, Simon was selected as the Labour candidate for Mayor of the West Midlands. He was defeated in the 2017 mayoral election by Conservative candidate Andy Street by 50.4% of the vote to 49.6% in the final round.

==Controversies==
On 5 September 2006, he and Chris Bryant co-ordinated a letter, signed by 17 Labour backbenchers, calling for Tony Blair to resign as prime minister. The MPs failed to force Blair out of office, but Blair publicly pledged to stand down within 12 months.

In October 2006, Simon created a YouTube spoof of Conservative Party leader David Cameron&#x27;s video blog, in which, pretending to be Cameron, he offered viewers one of his children and the opportunity to sleep with his wife. This led to criticism from both parties, with the stunt being called &quot;tasteless&quot;. In an interview on Sky News the same day, Simon defended himself and described Cameron&#x27;s attempts to reach out to the youth culture as &quot;shallow&quot; and &quot;pathetic&quot;. The video was removed on 13 October by Tom Watson, whom he described as a &quot;proppa blogga&quot;.

In 2009, it was revealed that Simon had breached parliamentary rules by renting his &quot;second home&quot; in London from his sister, Ceri Erskine, and paying her more than £40,000 in taxpayer-funded expenses. Simon claimed that he had inadvertently broken the rules and agreed to repay £21,000. He apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot;. Six weeks later Simon announced that he would resign from the government and stand down as MP for Birmingham Erdington.

==Personal life==
Simon was the boyfriend of former Labour and Change UK MP Luciana Berger in 2009-2010.
Simon suffers from the rare genetic disorder choroideremia: a condition that leads to progressive deterioration in eyesight, and in its later stage, blindness. He co-founded, and works as a trustee for, the Choroideremia Research Foundation. In January 2014, Simon donated a kidney to Labour MP Khalid Mahmood.

Simon lives in Birmingham, is a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and a season ticket holder at West Bromwich Albion F.C.

<text>The NBA G League, or simply the G League, is a professional basketball league in North America that serves as the developmental league of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The league comprises 31 teams; as of the 2024–25 season, all are single-affiliated or owned by an NBA team except for the independent Mexico City Capitanes.
The league was founded in 2001 as the National Basketball Development League (NBDL), renamed the NBA Development League (NBA D-League) in 2005. It received its present name in 2017 under a deal with Gatorade, becoming the first U.S. professional sports league named for an advertiser.

Initially eight teams, the league expanded after 2005 under a plan by NBA commissioner David Stern to develop it into a true minor-league farm system, with each team affiliated with one or more NBA teams. By mid-2014, one-third of NBA players had spent time in the league, up from 23% in 2011.

== History ==
===National Basketball Development League (2001–2005)===
On June 13, 2000, NBA commissioner David Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik announced the formation of the National Basketball Development League, to begin play in November 2001, with players required to be at least twenty years old. This was not the first time the league had their own minor league system, as they had used the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) as a developmental league for over two decades. The NBA had attempted to buy the CBA in March 2000, but they were rejected.

The league began its play as the National Basketball Development League (NBDL) in the 2001–02 season; the eight franchises were all located in the Southeastern United States (in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia). Each team logo was given NBDL branding that was differentiated by team colors.

Eight players were called up to the NBA during the season, which included Chris Andersen, the first player drafted by a NBDL team. The league made sponsorship deals with Reebok and television broadcasting deals with ESPN2 and Fox Sports South to broadcast select games during the first season (such as the NBDL Finals), which made them one of few minor league operations to have nationally televised games. The Greenville Groove won the first NBDL championship on April 8, 2002, after winning game 2 over the North Charleston Lowgators. The league saw an average attendance of 1,640 fans per game, lower than what the NBA expected.

===NBA Development League (2005–2017)===
In 2005, the league&#x27;s name was changed to NBA Development League (NBA D-League) as part of the new collective bargaining agreement with the NBA and a bid to appeal to more fans by showing the connection to the NBA. In the same offseason, Southwest Basketball, LLC led by David Kahn received league permission to operate four new teams. Southwest Basketball purchased three existing franchises and one expansion team: the Albuquerque Thunderbirds, Austin Toros, Fort Worth Flyers, and Tulsa 66ers. The Arkansas RimRockers were also added from the ABA for the 2005–06 season. In February 2006, the D-League expanded to California with the addition of the Bakersfield Jam. Two months later, the league announced that four teams from the CBA were joining the league: the Dakota Wizards, Sioux Falls Skyforce, Idaho Stampede, and a team originally slated for CBA expansion, the Colorado 14ers. Shortly after, the league announced expansion teams in the Anaheim Arsenal and the Los Angeles D-Fenders. The D-Fenders were the first D-League team to be directly owned by an NBA parent team, the Los Angeles Lakers.

However, the westward expansion contributed to the contraction of the NBA-owned Roanoke Dazzle and Fayetteville Patriots for that season. The Florida Flame suspended operations due to arena scheduling difficulties. After the 2006–07 season, there would be no more teams in the southeastern United States until the 2016 expansion team, the Greensboro Swarm.

After the 2006 to 2009 expansions, the league membership was fairly consistent with few relocations and suspensions. In 2009, the Houston Rockets entered into the first single-affiliation partnership, called the hybrid model, with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. This began a trend of NBA and D-League teams entering into single-affiliation agreements of both the hybrid and parent-team owned varieties. With more NBA involvement, the league once again began to expand and spread its footprint.

By 2015, the last multiple-affiliate team, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, was purchased by the Indiana Pacers, leading to the first season where all D-League teams were affiliated with only one NBA team. As there were no longer any unaffiliated D-League teams left, the remaining NBA teams began purchasing expansion franchises or hybrid partnership teams and placing them near the parent team. In 2015, the Toronto Raptors placed their own team, Raptors 905, in the Greater Toronto Area in Mississauga, Ontario. In 2016, the D-League expanded by three more NBA parent club-owned teams for the largest D-League expansion since 2007. The Charlotte Hornets created the Greensboro Swarm, the Brooklyn Nets created the Long Island Nets, and the Chicago Bulls created the Windy City Bulls.

===NBA G League (2017–present)===

In the 2017–18 season, the D-League entered into a multi-year partnership with Gatorade and rebranded as the NBA Gatorade League, which was officially shortened to &quot;NBA G League&quot; prior to the season. It also continued its membership changes with the relocation of the Erie BayHawks to Lakeland, Florida, as the Lakeland Magic, a new Erie BayHawks franchise, and expansions in the Agua Caliente Clippers in Ontario, California (now known as the San Diego Clippers), the Memphis Hustle in Southaven, Mississippi, and the Wisconsin Herd in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The Los Angeles D-Fenders would also re-brand to the South Bay Lakers.

In December 2017, the NBA and the live-streaming website Twitch announced that they would broadcast G League games on Twitch. Games have also been aired on the ESPN+ subscription service.

For the 2019–20 season, the G League began to offer select contracts to players who are not yet eligible to enter the NBA draft. Since 2006, players must be at least 19 years old by the end of the calendar year, creating what became known as the one-and-done rule where players would play one season of college basketball and then leave for the NBA. The new select contract was an alternative for players who do not want to or cannot attend a college, with players earning up to $125,000 per season. The league launched its prospects team, the NBA G League Ignite, in 2020. The G-League Ignite team folded after the 2023–2024 season.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic-curtailed 2019–20 season, the G League postponed the start of the following season. In January 2021, the league announced it would play all games at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, using the same isolation bubble as the 2020 NBA Bubble. Many teams opted out of participation, with only 17 of the 28 teams from the 2019–20 season plus the new Ignite prospects team choosing to take part in the abbreviated bubble season beginning in February 2021.

===Team ownership and NBA affiliations===
Ownership models vary across the NBA G League. Growing willingness among NBA organizations to invest in the G League has led to two main models: direct ownership of G League teams by parent NBA clubs and single-affiliate partnerships in which the G League team remains independently owned while the affiliate NBA team runs and finances basketball operations.

Parent club direct ownership began in 2006 when the Los Angeles Lakers bought their own NBA D-League franchise, originally known as the Los Angeles D-Fenders and since 2017–18 as the South Bay Lakers. This was followed by the San Antonio Spurs purchasing the Austin Toros (now the Austin Spurs) in 2007, and the Oklahoma City Thunder purchasing the Tulsa 66ers (now the Oklahoma City Blue) in 2008. More NBA teams began to either purchase existing franchises or create expansion teams to have their own single-affiliation teams. In 2011, the Cleveland Cavaliers purchased the New Mexico Thunderbirds to become the Canton Charge, and the Golden State Warriors purchased the Dakota Wizards, with the Warriors moving the Wizards a year later to become the Santa Cruz Warriors. In 2013, the Philadelphia 76ers purchased the inactive Utah Flash and moved them to Newark, Delaware, as the Delaware 87ers; the team is now the Delaware Blue Coats, and plays in Wilmington. In 2014, the New York Knicks became the seventh team to fully own and operate their own NBA D-League affiliate in the Westchester Knicks. In 2015, the Toronto Raptors created their own expansion franchise, the Raptors 905. In 2017, the Timberwolves purchased the Iowa Energy and renamed the team the Iowa Wolves. In 2017, the Atlanta Hawks launched their team in under the Erie BayHawks name and then relocated the franchise to College Park, Georgia, in 2019 as the College Park Skyhawks. In 2021, the Detroit Pistons relocated the Northern Arizona Suns to Detroit and renamed the team as the Motor City Cruise. In 2019, the New Orleans Pelicans launched their G League franchise as a third incarnation of the Erie BayHawks before relocating the team to Birmingham, Alabama, as the Birmingham Squadron in 2021. In April 2023, the Portland Trail Blazers announced they would be launching their affiliate, the Rip City Remix, beginning with the 2023–24 season. The Phoenix Suns then launched the Valley Suns as its affiliate team beginning with the 2024–25 season.

In 2009, the Houston Rockets and Rio Grande Valley Vipers pioneered the single-affiliate partnership, also known as the hybrid model. In November 2010, the New Jersey Nets and Springfield Armor announced they would enter into a single-affiliate partnership that began in 2011–12. In June 2011, the New York Knicks and Erie BayHawks announced they would be singly affiliated. In May 2012, the Portland Trail Blazers entered into a single-affiliation partnership with the Idaho Stampede. The following month, the Boston Celtics and Maine Red Claws announced a single-affiliation partnership. In June 2013, the Miami Heat announced that they had entered into a single-affiliated partnership with the Sioux Falls Skyforce. In July 2013, the Sacramento Kings and Reno Bighorns (now the Stockton Kings) entered into a single-affiliation. The Stampede ended their affiliation with the Trail Blazers after the 2013–14 season and in June 2014 announced their affiliation with the Utah Jazz. The Armor moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, after the 2013–14 season and affiliated with the Detroit Pistons. From 2014 to 2017, the Memphis Grizzlies had a single-affiliation with the Iowa Energy. In 2015, the last multiple affiliate team, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants (now the Indiana Mad Ants), were purchased by the Indiana Pacers, making the 2015–16 season the first with all teams having single-affiliations.

In some cases, the hybrid affiliation led to the parent team buying their affiliate&#x27;s franchise outright. On March 24, 2015, the Utah Jazz purchased their affiliate, the Idaho Stampede, and, after one more season in Boise, relocated the team to Salt Lake City. On April 11, 2016, the Phoenix Suns purchased their affiliate, the Bakersfield Jam, and announced the immediate relocation of the team to Prescott Valley, Arizona, as the Northern Arizona Suns beginning with the 2016–17 season. On October 20, 2016, the Sacramento Kings bought the majority ownership of their affiliate of the previous eight seasons, the Reno Bighorns, and would eventually move the team to Stockton, California, as the Stockton Kings after the 2017–18 season. On December 14, 2016, the Magic purchased their affiliate, the Erie BayHawks, with the intention to relocate the team to Lakeland, Florida, in 2017. In 2017, the Miami Heat purchased the controlling interest in the Sioux Falls Skyforce after being its primary affiliate since 2013. In July 2019, the Boston Celtics acquired its affiliate, the Maine Red Claws, then became the Maine Celtics in 2021.

Since 2020, the league added two teams without affiliation, one of which is still operational. On December 12, 2019, the Mexico City Capitanes, which had been playing in the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, was announced as joining the NBA G League as an independent team in the 2020–21 season on a five-year agreement. Due to the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic, a normal 2020–21 season did not occur and the Capitanes&#x27; debut was then delayed to the 2021–22 season. On April 16, 2020, the NBA launched a new development program for potential NBA prospects and a new unaffiliated team called the NBA G League Ignite, which began play in the 2020–21 season. The Ignite team, however, folded after the 2023–24 season.

== Player allocations ==
NBA G League players generally do not sign contracts with the individual teams, but with the league itself. G League team rosters consist of a total of 12 players, 10 (or fewer) being G League players and two (or more) NBA players. The rosters are made up in a number of ways: the previous year&#x27;s players, players taken in the G League draft, allocation players (meaning players who are assigned to a team with which they have a local connection, such as a University of Texas player being assigned to the Austin Spurs) and NBA team assignments. Each team also has local tryouts, and one player from the tryouts is assigned to the team.

The minimum age to play in the G League is 18, unlike the NBA which requires players to be 19 years old and one year out of high school in order to sign an NBA contract or be eligible for the draft. The base annual salary is US$35,000 plus housing and insurance benefits. Players who are called up for NBA get bonuses totalling up to US$50,000.

=== Draft ===

The NBA G League draft occurs each season and is the major source from which teams build their rosters. Team rosters are made up of returning players (players who were on the team during the previous season), players waived by an NBA team who are designated as an &#x27;affiliate player&#x27; to their respective G League affiliate, allocated players (players who have local significance), and drafted players. The eight round draft utilizes a serpentine format, meaning the order alternates in each round; Team A who selected first in Round 1 will select last in Round 2, while Team B who selected last in Round 1 will get the first pick in Round 2. Round 3 was added in 2014.

The league holds an annual Player Invitational, where prospects hope to earn eligibility for the upcoming draft.

===Draft rights player rule===
Since 2014–15, an NBA team that declines to sign an NBA draft pick can have them sign directly with their G League affiliate. Previously, an unsigned NBA pick could not be protected by the organization&#x27;s G League affiliate, and the player might have ended up on the G League team of another organization.

===Affiliate players===
Players waived by an NBA team during training camp and up until the start of the regular season can be designated as &quot;affiliate players&quot; and allocated to the NBA team&#x27;s G League affiliate. Each team is allowed four affiliate players. These are players that an NBA team is interested in developing in their own system. The affiliate players, however, still remain as free agents that any NBA team can sign.

===Assignment===
====Standard assignment====
Each NBA team can assign two first-year or second-year players who are under a standard NBA contract to its affiliated G League team. If more than two NBA players are assigned to a team, the team must reduce the number of G League players to keep the total roster size to 12. An NBA player will continue to be paid his NBA salary and will continue to be included on his NBA team&#x27;s roster on the inactive list while playing in the G League.

NBA teams can call up players as many times as they choose, and there is no limit to the number of times an NBA player with three years or less experience can be assigned to the G League. Starting in 2011–12, veteran NBA players could be assigned with their consent. The first example of such was with Yi Jianlian, who the Dallas Mavericks assigned to the Texas Legends for two games.

====Two-way contract====
The 2017 collective bargaining agreement for the NBA, which took effect with the 2017–18 season, included changes allowing each NBA team to sign two players on two-way contracts. Those players spend most of their time on the team&#x27;s G League roster, but can freely move to their respective NBA team for up to 45 days in the regular season, as well as be a part of the team&#x27;s roster before the start of the season (including NBA training camps) and after the conclusion of the G League&#x27;s regular season (though they are not allowed to be on a team&#x27;s playoff roster or play in a playoff game). Only players with four or fewer years of NBA experience are eligible for two-way contracts. The league&#x27;s newest CBA, which took effect with the 2023–24 season, increases the per-team limit on two-way contracts to three.

Unlike other G League players, who can be called up by any NBA team, two-way players can only be called up by their contracted NBA team. Players under two-way contracts are not counted against the NBA team&#x27;s regular roster limit, and can be assigned to a G League affiliate for development while also getting a larger salary whenever they are called up to the parent team. For teams that do not have a one-to-one affiliation with a G League team, a process similar to the &quot;flexible assignment&quot; rule is being used to determine the placement for their own two-way contracts in the G League until every team has their proper affiliation underway.

In addition, salaries for two-way players are much higher than those for regular G League players. As of the 2017–18 season, G League players who are not on two-way contracts earn either $19,500 or $26,000 during the league&#x27;s season. By contrast, two-way players&#x27; salaries while in the G League, which are pro-rated according to the number of days the player is with his G League team, are based on an annual salary between $50,000 and $75,000, and while these players are with their NBA team, they will earn a pro-rated portion of the NBA minimum rookie salary (which was $815,615 in the 2017–18 season).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, two-way players in 2020–21 were initially allowed to play up to 50 games in the NBA. Late in the season, restrictions were further lifted, allowing them to play more than 50 games as well as being eligible for the NBA playoffs.

=== Successful NBA call-ups ===
Many former NBA draftees, waived players, and undrafted players have played in the NBA G League. Bobby Simmons, Aaron Brooks, and Pascal Siakam are the only former D-League players to win an NBA end-of-season award; all won the Most Improved Player Award, with Simmons getting it with the Los Angeles Clippers in 2004–05, Brooks earning it with the Houston Rockets in 2009–10 and Siakam receiving it with the Toronto Raptors in the 2018-19 NBA season. Khris Middleton became the first former D-League player to be named an NBA All-Star when he was selected to participate in the 2019 All-Star Game.

In the 2008 NBA draft, the Idaho Stampede&#x27;s Mike Taylor was drafted 55th by the Portland Trail Blazers. He became the first player from the NBA D-League to be drafted by an NBA team. He was subsequently traded and signed a rookie contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. In the 2014 draft, two D-League players were selected for the first time: P. J. Hairston was drafted 26th (which was also the first time a D-League player was drafted in the first round in the NBA), and Thanasis Antetokounmpo was the 51st pick.

==Annual events==
=== All-Star Game ===

The league held its first All-Star game February 17, 2007, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was part of the NBA All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas. As with the NBA&#x27;s showcase game, a fan vote determined the starting lineup for each team. The East won, 114 to 100, with Pops Mensah-Bonsu named the game&#x27;s MVP.

The second annual All-Star game was held on February 16, 2008, at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans. The Blue team beat the Red team, 117–99, and Jeremy Richardson was named the MVP. In addition to the NBA D-League All-Star Game, the league debuted its first Dream Factory Friday Night events, which modeled after the NBA All-Star Saturday Night events. The events consists of Three-Point Shootout (won by Adam Harrington), Slam Dunk Contest (won by Brent Petway), and game of H-O-R-S-E (won by Lance Allred).

The 2009 D-League All-Star game was held on February 14, 2009, at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona. The Red Team defeated the Blue Team, 113–103, and Blake Ahearn and Courtney Sims were named co-MVPs. Along with the All-Star game, the NBA D-League ran their second annual Dream Factory Friday Night events. H-O-R-S-E was won by Will Conroy of the Albuquerque Thunderbirds. The Three-Point Shootout was won by Blake Ahearn of the Dakota Wizards, and the Slam Dunk Contest was won by James White of the Bakersfield Jam.

The 2010 D-League All-Star game was held on February 13, 2010, at the Dallas Convention Center in Dallas. The Western Conference team defeated the Eastern Conference Team, 98–81. Bakersfield Jam center Brian Butch, who scored 18 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, was named as the MVP of the game. The NBA D-League also ran their third annual Dream Factory Friday Night events. The inaugural Shooting Stars Competition was won by a team of Pat Carroll, Trey Gilder and Carlos Powell. The Three-Point Shootout was won by Andre Ingram of the Utah Flash, and the Slam Dunk Contest was won by Dar Tucker of the Los Angeles D-Fenders.

The game continued until 2017, with games continuing to be held during NBA All-Star Weekend at the same site. In 2018, it was replaced by a game between G League all-stars and the Mexico national team held in Los Angeles. After that event, this contest did not return in any form. Since 2022, select G League players participate in the Rising Stars Challenge alongside NBA rookie and sophomore players.

=== NBA G League Showcase ===
The league stages an annual NBA G League Showcase in which all of the league&#x27;s teams play each other in a &quot;carnival&quot; format. The showcase was first played in 2005 was originally intended solely as a scouting event for NBA general managers and scouts, but evolved into a four-day event with each team playing two games apiece. From 2005 to 2017, 15 players were called-up or recalled during or immediately following the Showcase.

As of 2019, the event&#x27;s location was the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Because of limited space at the conference center site, all games are played without spectators, although TV and Internet coverage is available for all games. The 2019 showcase was a series of mini-tournaments in which the winning team shared a $100,000 grand prize.

Before Las Vegas, host cities were Columbus, Georgia (2005); Fayetteville, North Carolina (2006); Sioux Falls, South Dakota (2007); Boise, Idaho (2008); Orem, Utah (2009); Boise, Idaho (2010); South Padre Island, Texas (2011); Reno, Nevada in 2012 and 2013; Santa Cruz, California in 2015; and Mississauga, Ontario in 2017 and 2018. It was not held in 2016.

<text>Keith Robert Simpson, (born 29 March 1949) is a British Conservative Party politician and military historian who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Broadland from 2010 to 2019, having previously served as the MP for Mid Norfolk from 1997 to 2010.

== Early life ==
Simpson was born in Norwich, the son of Harry Simpson and Jean Day. He was educated at Thorpe Grammar School (now known as Thorpe St Andrew School), in Thorpe St Andrew, Norfolk. He went on attain a BA in History at the University of Hull, and undertook postgraduate research in War Studies at King&#x27;s College London, where he completed a PGCE in 1975.

== Political career ==
Simpson served as the National Vice-Chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students from 1972–73.

He was Head of Foreign Affairs and Defence at Conservative Central Office from 1986–88. From 1988–90, he was a Political Adviser to the Secretary of State for Defence (first to George Younger, and then to Tom King).

Simpson was the Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Plymouth Devonport at the 1992 general election, where he lost to the Labour candidate David Jamieson.

At the 1997 general election, Simpson was elected as the Member of Parliament for Mid Norfolk with a majority of 1,336.

In July 1997, Simpson was appointed to the Conservative Parliamentary Defence Committee. In June 1998, he was appointed a frontbench defence spokesman. From June 1999 to June 2001, he was an Opposition Whip responsible for Treasury, Home Affairs and Health. He was subsequently appointed Shadow Agriculture Spokesman in October 2001. From 2002–05, he was Shadow Minister for Defence, and from 2005–10 he served as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs.

During its extensive coverage of the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published the story that Simpson had claimed £185 for light bulbs over a period of four years.

Following parliamentary boundary changes and prior to the 2010 general election, Simpson&#x27;s constituency of Mid Norfolk was redrawn. He was selected to stand for the newly created seat of Broadland, which derived from parts of the Mid Norfolk, Norfolk North and Norwich North constituencies. Simpson won the seat with a majority of 7,292.

Following the 2010 general election, Simpson was appointed the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government.

In May 2014 he was one of seven unsuccessful candidates for the chairmanship of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee.

In March 2015, he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and therefore granted the title The Right Honourable.

Simpson was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.

Simpson stood down at the 2019 general election.

== Career outside politics ==

<doc id="450394" wikidata="Q3100360" url="?curid=450394" title="Genaro Hernández">
<text>Genaro Hernández (May 10, 1966 – June 7, 2011) was a Mexican American professional boxer who competed from 1984 to 1998. Nicknamed &quot;Chicanito&quot; Hernandez, he went on to become a two-time super featherweight world champion, having held the WBA title from 1991 to 1995, and the WBC and lineal titles from 1997 to 1998. Additionally, he challenged for the WBO lightweight title in 1995.

==Professional career==
&quot;Chicanito&quot; Hernández, a Mexican-American, enjoyed a distinguished career as a professional boxer. His debut as a paid fighter came on September 27, 1984, when he beat Dino Ramirez by a decision in four rounds in Inglewood, California. He racked up a record of 13–0 with 6 knockouts and a solid reputation as a future champion around Southern California, when he met former Julio César Chávez world title challenger Refugio Rojas on November 22, 1988. He beat Rojas, who had lasted seven rounds against Chávez, by a knockout in round six. This enabled Hernández to enter the WBA super featherweight rankings. Hernandez went on to win seven more fights, four by knockout, including one over former world title challenger Felipe Orozco, and another, in his first professional fight abroad: a three-round knockout over Leon Collins in Tokyo, Japan.

===WBA super featherweight champion===
Exactly two years after his win over Rojas, Hernández got his first world title try, against Daniel Londas, on November 22, 1991, in Épernay, France. Hernández did not disappoint those who had predicted him to be a future world champion as he knocked out future world champion Londas in nine rounds in front of Londas&#x27; hometown crowd, becoming World Junior Lightweight champion by winning the until then vacant title. In 1992, he defended his crown twice, knocking out Omar Catari in six rounds and, travelling to Japan once more, defeating challengers Masuaki Takeda and Yuji Watanabe, Takeda by decision and Watanabe by knockout in six.

His next fight proved historic, albeit for the wrong reasons. Defending on April 26, 1993, once again in Inglewood against former world featherweight champion Raúl Pérez, Hernández had to settle for a first round technical draw. This was the first, and so far only, world title fight in which no punches were landed. Right after the initial bell, Perez headbutted Hernández, and Perez bled profusely from an arterial vein on his forehead. The referee summoned the ring doctor, who decided the fight should be stopped as Perez required immediate surgery. In the June 28 rematch later that year, Hernández retained the world title by a knockout in round eight. Hernandez then closed the year by defeating Harold Warren by decision to once again keep his title. In 1994, Hernandez retained the title twice, including a victory over Jimmy Garcia, (who would die later after a fight with Gabriel Ruelas). By the end of 1994, Hernández was clamoring for a world title fight against crosstown rival and WBO lightweight champion Oscar De La Hoya.

After eight successful title defenses, Hernández vacated his WBA super featherweight title in order to face De La Hoya in the upcoming year. Hernández began 1995 by beating popular Mexican boxer, Jorge &quot;Maromero&quot; Páez, by a knockout in eight rounds in Inglewood.

===WBO lightweight title challenge===

On September 9, the highly anticipated encounter between Hernández and de la Hoya took place in Las Vegas. Hernández lost for the first time in his career, retiring from the fight at the end of the sixth round, his nose bloody: He returned to his corner, but without sitting down motioned to his team that he did not want to continue the fight. Reportedly, he had come to the fight with a nose previously injured in a sparring session. Up until the fight&#x27;s end, the judges had de la Hoya holding a lead on all three scorecards. After the loss Hernández took some brief time off but by 1996 he was back inside the ring, winning two bouts that year.

===WBC and lineal super featherweight champion===

In 1997, he fought what almost turned into another controversial fight when he challenged Azumah Nelson in a title bout for the WBC &amp; Lineal super featherweight titles, in Corpus Christi, Texas. Ahead on all scorecards at the end of round seven, he was hit in his throat by a Nelson punch after the bell. He needed some time to recuperate from the illegal late hit, and WBC President José Sulaiman came to his corner and informed him that if he could not continue he would be declared winner by disqualification. Hernández told Sulaiman something along the lines of &quot;I want to win it like real champions do&quot;, and he went back to the fight at the beginning of round eight. The fight ended after twelve rounds and Hernández won the Super featherweight titles by defeating Nelson with a split decision victory.

Hernández went on to defend his crown against such capable challengers as future super featherweight champion Anatoly Alexandrov, Carlos Gerena and another future world champion Carlos Famoso Hernandez, a gym-mate and personal friend who would later become El Salvador&#x27;s first world boxing champion in history.

In what would turn out to be his last fight, on October 3 of 1998 he lost his titles to Floyd Mayweather Jr. by an 8th round retirement.

===Retirement===
In December 1998, after he was diagnosed with a blood clot and a torn cartilage muscle, he announced his retirement with a record of 38 wins, 2 losses and 1 draw, with 17 of those wins coming by knockout. He had intended to challenge WBC lightweight champion César Bazán before the diagnosis.

==Professional boxing record==

==Life after boxing==

Hernández worked as a boxing color commentator on television, broadcasting several fights including the Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Diego Corrales fight on January 20, 2001. He was a boxing instructor at the LA Boxing Gym in Lake Forest, California until early 2011. He also assisted with regional boxing broadcasts in California.

==Illness and death==
After retiring from boxing Hernández was diagnosed with stage four rhabdomyosarcoma of the head and neck, a very rare form of cancer, and one which Hernández&#x27; insurance would not cover for treatment. Although Hernández collected several large purses in his career, including $600,000 for his final fight against Mayweather, he was not able to afford his expensive treatments and benefits were held to assist in paying what insurance would not cover. Bob Arum, of Top Rank Promotions, who promoted Hernández, footed Hernandez&#x27; bills for chemotherapy for a number of years, until Hernandez died, also having him brought to and from the chemotherapy sessions. In mid 2009 it was reported that Hernández&#x27; cancer was in remission but in early 2010 the cancer had returned and Hernández was undergoing treatment.

On June 3, 2011, it was announced that Hernández would stop chemotherapy treatment. Hernández died from cancer on June 7, 2011, at the age of 45. Floyd Mayweather paid for Hernández&#x27;s funeral expenses.

<doc id="450395" wikidata="Q524389" url="?curid=450395" title="Maratha (caste)">
<text>The Maratha caste is composed of 96 clans, originally formed in the earlier centuries from the amalgamation of families from the peasant (Kunbi), shepherd (Dhangar), blacksmith (Lohar), pastoral (Gavli), carpenter (Sutar), Bhandari, Thakar and Koli castes in Maharashtra. Many of them took to military service in the 16th century for the Deccan sultanates or the Mughals. Later in the 17th and 18th centuries, they served in the armies of the Maratha Kingdom, founded by Shivaji, a Maratha Kunbi by caste. Many Marathas were granted hereditary fiefs by the Sultanates, and Mughals for their service.

According to the Maharashtrian historian B. R. Sunthankar, and scholars such as Rajendra Vora, the &quot;Marathas&quot; are a &quot;middle-peasantry&quot; caste which formed the bulk of the Maharashtrian society together with the other Kunbi peasant caste. Vora adds that the Marathas account for around 30 per cent of the total population of the state and dominate the power structure in Maharashtra because of their numerical strength, especially in the rural society.

According to Jeremy Black, British historian at the University of Exeter, &quot;Maratha caste is a coalescence of peasants, shepherds, ironworkers, etc. as a result of serving in the military in the 17th and 18th century&quot;. They are the dominant caste in rural areas and mainly constitute the landed peasantry. As of 2018, 80% of the members of the Maratha caste were farmers.

Marathas are subdivided into 96 different clans, known as the &quot;96 Kuli Marathas&quot; or &quot;Shahānnau Kule.&quot; Three clan lists exist but the general body of lists are often at great variance with each other. These lists were compiled in the 19th century.
There is not much social distinction between the Marathas and Kunbis since the 1950s.

The Maratha king Shivaji founded the Maratha Kingdom that included warriors and other notables from Maratha and several other castes from Maharashtra. It was dominant in India for much of the 18th century.

==Origin==
Modern research has revealed that the Marathas and Kunbi have the same origin. Most recently, the Kunbi origin of the Maratha has been explained in detail by historians Richard Eaton and Stewart Gordon. Marathas who were distinguished from the Kunbi, in the past claimed genealogical connections with Rajputs of northern India. However, modern researchers demonstrate, giving examples, that these claims are not factual. Modern scholars agree that Marathas and Kunbi are the same. Anthropologist J. V. Ferreira writes: &quot;The Maratha claim to belong to the ancient 96 Kshatriya families has no foundation in fact and may have been adopted after the Marathas became with Shivaji a power to be reckoned with&quot;. Gordon writes how the Maratha caste was generated from the Kunbis who served the Muslim rulers, prospered, and over time adopted different customs like different dressing styles, employed genealogists, started identifying as Maratha, and caste boundaries solidified between them. In the nineteenth century, economic prosperity rather than martial service to the Muslims replaced the mobility into Maratha identity. Eaton gives an example of the Holkar family that originally belonged to the Dhangar (shepherd) caste but was given a Maratha or even an &quot;arch-Maratha&quot; identity. The other example, given by Susan Bayly, is of the Bhonsles who originated among Maratha and Kunbi populations of the Deccani tiller-plainsmen. Similarly, scholars write that the Shinde (also known as Scindia) Maratha clan originated from the Kunbi caste and the Scindia&#x27;s founder was a servant of the Peshwa who would carry his slippers. Dhanmanjiri Sathe states that &quot;The line between Marathas and Kunbis is thin and sometimes difficult to ascertain&quot;. Iravati Karve, an anthropologist, showed how the Maratha caste was generated from Kunbis who simply started calling themselves &quot;Maratha&quot;. She states that Maratha, Kunbi and Mali are the three main farming communities of Maharashtra – the difference being that the Marathas and Kunbis were &quot;dry farmers&quot; whereas the Mali farmed throughout the year. Cynthia Talbot quotes a saying in Maharashtra, &quot;when a Kunbi prospers he becomes Maratha&quot;. The Kunbi origin has been one of the factors on the basis of which the head of Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC), a Judge, M.G. Gaikwad, and some others in 2018, stated that Maratha associations have submitted historical proofs and petitions to be included in the Other Backward Class. The decision for giving reservation in jobs and education for Marathas based on the petitions that Marathas and Kunbis are one and the same caste was upheld by the Mumbai court in 2019.

==History==
The term &quot;Maratha&quot; referred broadly to all the speakers of the Marathi language. In the 17th century, it also served as a designation for peasants from the Deccan Plateau who served as soldiers in the armies of Muslim rulers and later in the armies of Shivaji. Thus, the term &quot;Maratha&quot; became a marker of an endogamous caste for them. A number of Maratha warriors, including Shivaji&#x27;s father, Shahaji, originally served in those Muslim armies. By the mid-1660s, Shivaji had established an independent Maratha kingdom. After Shivaji&#x27;s death, Marathas fought under his sons and defeated Aurangzeb in the Mughal–Maratha Wars. The Maratha empire was further expanded into a vast empire by the Maratha Confederacy including Peshwas, stretching from central India in the south to Peshawar (in modern-day Pakistan) on the Afghanistan border in the north, and with expeditions in Bengal to the east.

The Confederacy remained the pre-eminent power in India until their defeat by the British East India Company in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818).

By the 19th century, the term &quot;Maratha&quot; had several interpretations in the British administrative records. In the Thane District Gazetteer of 1882, the term was used to denote elite layers within various castes: for example, &quot;Maratha-Agri&quot; within the Agri caste and &quot;Maratha-Koli&quot; within the Koli caste. In the Pune District, the words Kunbi and Maratha had become synonymous, giving rise to the Maratha-Kunbi caste complex. The Pune District Gazetteer of 1882 divided the Kunbis into two classes: Marathas and other Kunbis. The 1901 census listed three groups within the Maratha-Kunbi caste complex: &quot;Marathas proper&quot;, &quot;Maratha Kunbis&quot; and Konkan Maratha.

According to Steele, in the early 19th century, Kunbis, who were agriculturists, and the Marathas who claimed Rajput descent and Kshatriya status, were distinguished by their customs related to widow remarriage. The Kunbis allowed it and the higher status Marathas prohibited it. However, there is no statistical evidence for this. However, the Kunbis and Marathas had hypergamous inter-community marriages – a rich Kunbi could always marry his daughter to a poor Maratha.

Historically, the Maratha population comprised more than 31% of the population in Maharashtra and the Kunbi was 7%, whereas the upper castes, Brahmins, Saraswat, and Prabhus, were earlier only about 4% of the population. The Other Backward Class population (other than the Kunbi) was 27% while the population of the Mahars was 12%.

Gradually, the term &quot;Maratha&quot; came to denote an endogamous caste. From 1900 onwards, the Satyashodhak Samaj movement defined the Marathas as a broader social category of non-Brahmin groups. These non-Brahmins gained prominence in the Indian National Congress during the Indian independence movement. In independent India, these Marathas became the dominant political force in the newly formed state of Maharashtra.

The ritual caste hierarchy in Maharashtra is led by the Deshasthas, Chitpawans, Karhades, Saraswats and the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus. The Maratha are ranked lower under this classification than the above castes but are considered higher than the Kunbi, backward castes and castes that were considered ritually impure. According to the Chairperson of the Centre for Social Justice and Governance, this caste ranking is significant even in recent times in inter-caste matrimonial alliances between Maharashtrians.

==Internal diaspora==
Expansion of Maratha Empire also resulted in the voluntary relocation of substantial numbers of Maratha and other Marathi-speaking people outside Maharashtra, and across a big part of India. Today several significant communities descended from these emigrants live in the north, south and west of India. These descendant communities tend often to speak the local languages, although many also speak Marathi in addition. Notable Maratha families outside Maharashtra include Bhonsle of Tanjore, Scindia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda, Holkar of Indore, Pawar of Dewas and Dhar, Ghorpade of Mudhol.

== Culture ==
===Literacy===
In 17th century Maharashtra, the Brahmins and CKPs were the communities that had a system of higher education in Gurukula or lower-level education in clerical work or book-keeping. Education of all other castes and communities consisted of listening to oral reproductions from sacred texts like the Puranas and Kirtans. However, despite lack of education, the Maratha caste due to their long tradition of service in military of the Yadavas and later the Muslim sultanates produced good soldiers and commanders.

Stewart Gordon writes that the prominent Ghorpade Maratha family, for instance, was not literate and had to use Brahmins as record keepers.

Gail Omvedt concludes that during the British era, the overall literacy of Brahmins and CKPs was overwhelmingly high as compared to the literacy of the Maratha and Kunbi communities where it was strikingly low. The artisan castes were intermediate in terms of literacy. For all castes, men were more literate than the women from that caste(respectively). Female literacy, as well as English literacy, showed the same pattern among castes.

A Bhandari author from 1920s quotes, according to Monika Vaidya, that Brahmins are not to blame for the lack of education of Marathas, as shown by communities whose occupations required education, like the Prabhus, Saraswats and CKP. These communities got education despite the barriers imposed by the Brahmins and it has been argued that the need for reservations does not arise if each community tries for its own development.

===Marriages===
Like other Maharashtrian communities such as Kunbis, Malis, Mahars, etc., the marriage of a man to his maternal uncle&#x27;s (&quot;mama&quot; in Marathi) daughter is common in the Maratha community. Maratha and Kunbis intermarried in a hypergamous way i.e. a rich Kunbi&#x27;s daughter could always marry a poor Maratha. Anthropologist Donald Attwood shows giving an example of the Karekars of Ahmednagar that this trend continues even in recent times indicating that the social order is fluid and flexible.

====Dowry Issues====
Being a politically dominant caste, the Marathas have not been able to progress beyond the social practices of Dowry (Dowry refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride&#x27;s family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage.). 80% of the Maratha community are farmers and there have been cases where the Maratha farmers had to sell their lands just to get their daughters married. Data compiled by the Maratha Kranti Morcha members showed that the expenditure incurred by an average low income and poor Maratha family has doubled in the last 10 years when it comes to dowry. A member said (in 2018), &quot;The dowry amount ranges from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, depending on the profession of the groom. The lower-middle class Marathas too often have to bear an expenditure of Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh for a daughter&#x27;s wedding. Even in the remote villages, a small and marginal farmer spends Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh on a daughter&#x27;s wedding.&quot; Some caste members tried to use the Morcha to address the issue of Dowry but they did not get a positive response. Dowry has now attained a status symbol in the community and that is part of the issue.

====Widows====
Research by a sociologist has shown that the restrictions faced by widows among Marathi Brahmins, Saraswats and CKP were significantly more than those faced by widows in Maratha caste.

===Festivals and Gods===
Rosalind O&#x27;Hanlon, Professor at the University of Oxford stated that the Hindu God Khandoba, also known by the name Mhasoba, is traditionally very popular in the Maratha caste. She quotes about the devotion of the Marathas in the 19th century to Mhasoba as follows:
Mhasoba was also worshiped by the Bhonsles.
The other Hindu deity popular in the Maratha community is the Goddess Bhavani of Tuljapur.

Maratha leaders said that &quot;Chhatrapati Shivaji is worshiped by the Maratha community, while different sections of society hold him in high esteem&quot;. &quot;Shivaji Jayanti&quot; (his birthday) is celebrated with folk dances, songs, plays and Puja. There was some controversy over the date but it is now celebrated on 19 February. Earlier, the regional Marathi political parties – Shiv Sena as well as the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena were celebrating it as per the Tithi according to the Hindu Calendar (&quot;Falgun Vadya Tritiya&quot; – third day of the month of Falgun), whereas the State Government was celebrating it as per the Gregorian Calendar.

==Varna status==

Research by modern anthropologists and historians has shown that the Maratha caste originated from the amalgamation of families from the peasant communities that belonged to the Shudra Varna. However, after gaining political prominence with Shivaji&#x27;s rise to power, this caste started claiming Kshatriya descent and genealogies were fabricated including those for Shivaji. Thus, the &quot;96 clans&quot;(Kuls)(&quot;96 Kuli Marathas&quot; or &quot;Shahānnau Kule&quot;) genealogies were concocted most likely after Shivaji came to power. Gordon explains that there are three such lists for the 96 clans compiled in the 19th century and they are &quot;impossible to reconcile&quot; due to this nature of origin of the caste. Jaffrelot writes that this process where Shudras pretend to be Kshatriyas and follow their customs is called &quot;Kshatriyatization&quot; and is a variation of Sanskritization.

Modern scholars such as M. S. A. Rao and Francine Frankel also agree that the Varna of Marathas remained Shudra, an indication being: &quot;the maratha practice of hypergamy which permitted inter-marriage with rising peasant kunbi lineages, and created a hierarchy of maratha kuls, whose boundaries were flexible enough to incorporate, by the twentieth century, most of the kunbi population&quot;.

By the late 19th century, some Brahmins made public proclamations of their Shudra status but some moderate Brahmins were keen to ally with the influential Marathas of Bombay in the interests of Indian independence from Britain. These Brahmins, motivated by such political reasons, supported the Maratha claim to Kshatriya status, but the success in this political alliance was sporadic and fell apart entirely following independence in 1947.

As late as the turn of 20th century, the Brahmin priests of Shahu, the Maratha ruler of Kolhapur refused to use Vedic mantras and would not take a bath before chanting, on the grounds that even the leading Marathas such as Shahu and his family belonged to the Shudra varna. This opinion about the Shudra varna was supported by Brahmin Councils in Maharashtra and they stuck to their opinion even when they (the Brahmins) were threatened with the loss of land and property. This led to Shahu supporting Arya Samaj and Satyashodhak Samaj as well as campaigning for the rights of the Maratha community. He soon became the leader of the non-Brahmin movement and united the Marathas under his banner.

Gaikwad, the leader of Sambhaji Brigade, a prominent Maratha caste organisation, stated in an interview, that before Indian Independence, &quot;Backward Class federation had raised the concerns of the Shudra communities including the Marathas&quot;.

Maratha caste does not have the upanayanam or &quot;sacred thread ceremony&quot; of ritually upper caste Hindus. However, despite the ritual status, the Marathas have significant political power.

In the 21st century, the Government of Maharashtra cited historical incidents for the claim of Shudra status of prominent Maratha families to form a case for reservation for the Marathas in the state. Additionally, a report by an independent commission in November 2018 concluded that the Maratha caste is educationally, socially and economically a backward community.

==Affirmative Action==

In Karnataka, the Marathas are classified as Other Backward Class with the exception of the Marathas of Kodagu district who are classified as a Scheduled Tribe. In Maharashtra, they were classified as a Forward caste by the Mandal commission. In 2018, they were classified as Socially and Educationally Backward (SEBC) and were granted 16% reservation in jobs and education. In 2019, the court upheld the quota but recommended that the quota be cut to 12%.

In November 2022, the Government of Maharashtra declared that needy Maratha students who live in hostels would be getting a stipend of Indian Rupees sixty thousand per year.

== Inter-caste issues ==

===Anti-Marwadi/Anti-Brahmin Deccan riots of 1875===
Claude Markovits, director of center of Indian and South-Asian studies, writes, that in 1875, in places such as Pune and Ahmednagar, Marwadi moneylenders became victims of coordinated attacks by the &quot;local peasantry of the Maratha caste&quot;. Historian, David Ludlen states that the motivation for the violence was destroying the debt agreements that the moneylenders held over the Maratha farmers. These riots were known as the &quot;Deccan riots&quot;. According to John McLane, the victims were mostly Marwadi moneylenders but Marathi speaking Brahmin moneylenders were usually spared. However, according to Lele, in Ahmednagar, Poona and Satara, the Marathas led the riots to challenge the Brahmins, who were a majority of the money lenders.
===Anti-Brahmin Violence===
Following the assassination of Gandhi in 1948 by Nathuram Godse, a Chitpawan Brahmin from Pune, other Brahmins in Maharashtra became targets of violence, mostly from elements from the Maratha caste. Later, in Sangli, Jains and Lingayats joined the Marathas in their attacks against the Brahmins. Thousands of offices and homes were also set on fire. Molestation incidents were also reported during these attacks. On the first day alone, the number of deaths in Bombay were 15, and 50 in Pune.

One scholar has observed, &quot;It will be too much to believe that the riots took place because of the intense love of Gandhiji on the part of the Marathas. Godse became a very convenient hate symbol to damn the Brahmins and burn their properties.&quot;
Donald Rosenthal opines that the motivation for the violence was the historic discrimination and humiliation that the Maratha community faced due to their caste status. He writes, &quot;Even today, local Brahmins claim that the Marathas organized the riots to take political advantage of the situation&quot;.

In Satara alone, the official reports show that about 1000 houses were burnt in about 300 villages. There were &quot;cruel, cold-blooded killings&quot; as well – for example, one family whose last name happened to be &#x27;Godse&#x27; had three of its male members killed. Brahmins suffered from serious physical violence as well as economic violence in the form of looting.

Maureen Patterson concludes that the greatest violence took place not in the cities of Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur – but in Satara, Kolhapur and Belgaum. Destruction was extensive in Kolhapur. Earlier in the century, Shahu of Kolhapur had actively collaborated with the British against the Indian freedom struggle which he identified being led by Chitpavan Brahmins such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Shahu was also actively involved in the anti-Brahmin movement as well. During the 1948 disturbances, in Sangli, the local Jain and the Lingayat communities joined the Marathas in the attacks against the Brahmins. Here, specifically, the factories owned by the Chitpawan Brahmins were destroyed. This event led to the hasty integration of the Patwardhan ruled princely states into the Bombay Province by March 1948.

===Worli BDD Chawl violence===
The BDD Chawl in the Worli inner suburb of Mumbai is a complex of buildings which were built in 1920s to house workers employed by the textile mills.
In the 1970s, at the height of the Dalit Panther movement, fights between the Chawl&#x27;s dominant Maratha population and the Neo-Buddhists living in 20-odd buildings resulted in full-scale riots. Violence between the communities continued through the 1970s to the early 1990s.

===Other incidents of caste related violence===
==== Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute ====
Sambhaji Brigade is a branch of &quot;Maratha Seva Sangh&quot;(a Maratha caste organisation) and has committed acts of violence. In 2004, a mob of 150 Maratha activists attacked the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute - the reason being a book by James Laine. The vandalism led to loss of valuable historic documents and an estimated loss of Rs 1.25 crore. Sanskrit and religious documents dating back to the 16th century were destroyed, translation of the RigVeda by the Shankaracharya was thrown on the road. A woman who tried to call the police had bricks pelted at her by the mob.

====Ram Ganesh Gadkari Statue====
In 2017, the statue of Ram Ganesh Gadkari, a noted playwright and poet who showed Sambhaji in a poor light in his 1919 play &#x27;Rajsanyas&#x27;, was uprooted and thrown in the river by Sambhaji Brigade. The Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu(CKP), the community to which Gadkari belonged later organised a meeting to protest this incident at the &quot;Ram Ganesh Gadkari Rangayatan&quot;(a theatre named after Gadkari) in Thane. As per Smriti Koppikar, &quot;the symbols and markers of Brahmin and/or upper caste ideology have proved to be an eyesore for Marathas&quot;. Devendra Fadnavis said that the statue would be restored. At the location of the bust, the &quot;Brahman Mahasangh&quot;(a Brahmin caste organisation) kept a photo of Gadkari and Medha Vishram Kulkarni supported the Brahmin organisation&#x27;s decision and announced that parts of the play would be read in Sambhaji Park. The BJP as well as the Shiv Sena alleged that the Sambhaji Brigade was trying to divide the community. Nitesh Rane later rewarded the vandals and made inflammatory remarks claiming that he had announced a reward earlier in 2016 for removing the bust, and was proud of the act carried out by the accused.

====Violence related to inclusion in the Other Backward Caste (OBC)====

In 2018, several incidents of violence were reported due to agitation over the delay of the inclusion of the Maratha caste in the Other Backward Class category. The agitation was started by the Maratha Kranti Morcha. In June 2018, the Marathas threatened violent protests if their demands were not met. In July, Maratha protests turned violent as the protesters attacked police and torched police vehicles. Several incidents, including some deaths, were reported in other locations as well – several police were injured by the mobs, public property was damaged and private cars were torched. In Navi Mumbai itself, hundreds of vehicles were torched and buses were set on fire in cities such as Mumbai and Pune.

===Other inter caste issues===
====Medha Khole Incident====
In a widely publicised 2017 incident, a Brahmin scientist by the name of Medha Vinayak Khole(Deputy Director-General for the weather forecasting section) filed a police complaint against her Maratha domestic worker, Nirmala Yadav, for hiding her caste and &quot;violating ritual purity and sanctity&quot;. Khole even insulted the latter&#x27;s Gods, Khandoba (a popular God worshipped by most Marathi Hindu communities) and Mhasoba (a Hindu God worshiped by Pastoral communities and very popular in the Marathas). The &quot;Akhil Bhartiya Bramhan Mahasangh&quot; initially came out in support of Khole. However, there were widespread protests not just by Maratha caste organisations but also by non-caste organisations like Domestic Workers Unions and Women&#x27;s organisations and Khole was widely criticised.

==Political participation==
The 1919 Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms of the British colonial government called for caste based representation in legislative council. In anticipation a Maratha league party was formed. The league and other groups came together to form the non-Brahmins party in the Marathi speaking areas in the early 1920s under the leadership of Maratha leaders Keshavrao Jedhe and Baburao Javalkar. Their early goals in that period were capturing the Ganpati and Shivaji festivals from Brahmin domination. They combined nationalism with anti-casteism as the party&#x27;s aims. Later on in the 1930s, Jedhe merged the non-Brahmin party with the Congress party and changed the Congress party in the Maharashtra region from an upper-caste dominated body to a more broadly based but Maratha-dominated party. Apart from Jedhe, most Congress leaders from the Maratha /Kunbi community remained aloof from the Samyukta Maharashtra campaign of the 1950s. However, they have dominated the state politics of Maharashtra since its inception in 1960.

The INC was the preferred party of the Maratha/Kunbi community in the early days of Maharashtra and the party was long without a major challenger, and enjoyed overwhelming support from the Maratha dominated sugar co-operatives and thousands of other cooperative organisations involved in the rural agricultural economy of the state such as marketing of dairy and vegetable produce, credit unions etc. The domination by Marathas of the cooperative institutions and with it the rural economic power allowed the community to control politics from the village level up to the Assembly and Lok Sabha seats. Since the 1980s, this group has also been active in setting up private educational institutions. Major past political figures of Congress party from Maharashtra such as Panjabrao Deshmukh, Keshavrao Jedhe, Yashwantrao Chavan, Shankarrao Chavan and Vilasrao Deshmukh have been from this group.
Sharad Pawar, who has been a towering figure in Maharashtrian and national politics, belongs to this group.

The state has had many Maratha government ministers and officials, as well as in local municipal councils, and panchayats. Marathas comprise around 32 per cent of the state population. 10 out of 16 chief ministers of Maharashtra hailed from the Maratha community as of 2012.

The rise of the Hindu Nationalist Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party in recent years have not dented Maratha representation in Maharashtra Legislative assembly.

Shiv Sena&#x27;s strength mainly came from the Maratha support which it drew away from the Congress. In 1990, 24 MLAs elected from Shiv Sena were Marathas which increased to 33 in 2004 (more than 50%). Thus, researcher Vora concludes that the Shiv Sena has been emerging as a &quot;Maratha Party&quot;.

Maratha Seva Sangh, a Maratha caste based organisation and its youth wing Sambhaji Brigade came into the political scene after the BORI attack. The group distances itself from the Hindu nationalist parties like the BJP and Shiv Sena and invokes a secular anti-Brahmin genealogy from Shivaji, Tukaram, Jyotirao Phule and B. R. Ambedkar. In late 2004, Maratha Seva Sangh announced that they had established a new religion called &quot;Shiv Dharma&quot; to protest &quot;Vedic Brahminism&quot; and oppose Hinduism. The details of this are published in &quot;Jijau Brigade va Sambhaji Brigade Sanskarmala, Maratha Sanskarmala I&quot;.

==Military service==

The Duke of Wellington, after defeating the Marathas, noted that the Marathas, though poorly led by their Generals, had regular infantry and artillery that matched the level of that of the Europeans and warned other British officers from underestimating the Marathas on the battlefield. He cautioned one British general that: &quot;You must never allow Maratha infantry to attack head on or in close hand to hand combat as in that your army will cover itself with utter disgrace&quot;.

Norman Gash says that the Maratha infantry was equal to that of British infantry. After the Third Anglo-Maratha war in 1818, Britain listed the Marathas as one of the Martial Races to serve in the British Indian Army although it was unclear whether this categorisation referred to the Maratha caste or a subset of some Marathi castes. Despite praising the military prowess of the Marathas, the British considered them inferior to Sikhs and Gurkhas in terms of other masculine traits due to prevailing Christian notions of being a &quot;man at arm&quot; in battlefield i.e., they disapproved of Maratha utilisation of guerrilla warfare in combat along with their uncharitable and ruthless attitudes. However, racial theories have been discredited.
Lord Roberts, commander-in-chief of the Indian Army 1885–1893, who came up with the &quot;Martial Race&quot; theory, stated that in order to improve the quality of the army, there was a need to use &quot;more warlike and hardy races&quot; instead of the current sepoys from Bengal, the Tamils, Telugus and the Marathas. Based on this theory, Gurkhas and Sikhs were recruited by the British army and they were &quot;construed as martial races&quot; in preference to other races in India. Historian Sikata Banerjee notes a dissonance in British military opinions of the Maratha, wherein the British portrayed them as both &quot;formidable opponents&quot; and yet not &quot;properly qualified&quot; for fighting in the western manner, criticising the Maratha guerrilla tactics as an improper way of war. Banerjee cites an 1859 statement as emblematic of this disparity: 

The Maratha Light Infantry regiment is one of the &quot;oldest and most renowned&quot; regiments of the Indian Army. Its First Battalion, also known as the &quot;Jangi Paltan&quot; (&quot;Warrior Platoon&quot;), traces its origins to 1768 as part of the Bombay Sepoys.

The battle cry of Maratha Light Infantry is &quot;Bol Shri Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki Jai!&quot; (&quot;Hail Victory to Emperor Shivaji!&quot;) in tribute to the Maratha sovereign and their motto is &quot;Shatrujeet&quot; (victory over enemy).

<text>New Right (Dutch: &quot;Nieuw Rechts&quot;, abbr. NR) was a nationalist Dutch political party, founded by Michiel Smit in February 2003 and dissolved in December 2007.

==History==
Michiel Smit was secretary of Pim Fortuyn&#x27;s local Leefbaar Rotterdam party. He was elected into the Rotterdam city council in March 2002. After the assassination of Fortuyn, May 6, 2002, the Leefbaar Rotterdam leadership was handed over to Ronald Sørensen. Michiel Smit was forced out of the Leefbaar Rotterdam party though in February 2003, after it became public that Smit participated on various rightwing radical internet fora, one of which was the American-based &quot;Stormfront&quot;.
However, Smit held on to his seat in the Rotterdam city council, forming a one-person party called Nieuw Rechts. From this position, Smit started to build up the Nieuw Rechts party. New Right worked with the nationalist NNP party (whose chairman Florens van der Kooi worked for a time at the New Right party office) to form the &quot;Actiecomité Stop MARTIJN&quot; in 2003, which campaigned against the pedophiles of the Vereniging MARTIJN.

In the first electoral campaign (the 2004 European Elections), the party attracted 0.3% of the votes, and no seats. In the Dutch municipal elections of 2006, New Right fielded candidates in Rotterdam, Ridderkerk, Almelo and Eindhoven, obtaining 0.06% of the total vote and one seat in the council of Ridderkerk.

==Ideology==
The most important issue for the New Right was immigration and integration of Muslims. Smit held then controversial views like forced repatriation of criminal foreigners and mandatory Dutch services in mosques. These views have since become mainstream in Dutch politics.

<text>Mimail is a computer worm which first emerged in August 2003; it is transmitted via e-mail. Since its initial release, nearly two dozen variants of the original Mimail worm have appeared. The Mydoom worm, which emerged in January 2004, was initially believed to be a variant of Mimail. Mimail is written in the C programming language.

<text>The Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. (FSFE) is an organization that supports free software and all aspects of the free software movement in Europe, with registered chapters in several European countries. It is a registered voluntary association (German: &quot;eingetragener Verein&quot;) incorporated under German law.

FSFE was founded in 2001. It is the European sister organization of the USbased Free Software Foundation (FSF), although each foundation exists as a separate organization. Following the return of Richard Stallman to the FSF in 2021, the FSFE declared themselves &quot;unable to collaborate&quot; with the FSF.

== Goals ==
FSFE believes that access to (and control of) software determines who may participate in a digital society. Consequently, FSFE believes, the freedoms to use, copy, modify and redistribute software, as described in The Free Software Definition, are necessary for equal participation in the Information Age. The focus of FSFE&#x27;s work is political, legal, and social, with the aim of promoting free software and the ethical, philosophical, social, political and commercial values that it implements. In particular, it:
* is actively promoting free software politically as a Europe-based global competence center in dialog with politicians and press
* follows and seeks to influence legal and political activities that are contrary to the goals and values of Free Software
* provides a contact point and orientational help on all issues regarding Free Software
* works closely together with lawyers active in the Free Software area in universities and practices in order to follow and influence the legal discourse; also, it cooperates with lawyers throughout Europe to maximize the legal security of Free Software
* supports, coordinates and develops projects in the Free Software area, especially the GNU Project; it also provides computer resources to Free Software developers to enable them to continue their developments
* helps companies to develop business models based on Free Software or fit existing models to it; it encourages companies in their evolution to Free Software; to make it easier for companies based on Free Software to be commercially successful, the FSF Europe also seeks to broaden the market for Free Software
* helps coordinating and networking other initiatives in the Free Software area

== Example projects ==


Projects undertaken by FSFE include:

*&quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign. In September 2017, FSFE launched the &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign by publishing an open letter signed by other organizations and calling for European and national Members of Parliament to “Implement legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software license”. Among the 150 signing organizations (as of July 2018), the campaign is supported by digital rights NGOs like Creative Commons, Open Source Initiative, Electronic Frontier Foundation, EDRi, April, Chaos Computer Club, and national chapters of Wikimedia (Germany, Czech Republic, France and Italy) as well as organizations responsible for the development and maintenance of Free and Open Source Software like OpenSUSE, Fedora, Tor, Debian and Videolan. The campaign was publicly endorsed by more than 18 000 individuals (as of July 2018) including public figures such as Edward Snowden, Francesca Bria (CTO of the city of Barcelona) as well as public administrations like the City of Barcelona.
* Software patents in Europe: According to the FSFE, software patents for Europe are currently being pushed forward actively by a lobby gathering around the European patent office and the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represents the interests of the largest US companies. Software patents are considered by the FSFE to be a menace to society and economy and FSF Europe is actively involved in the resistance to such plans.
*European Union v. Microsoft: In 2001 the European Union, through the DG Competition of the European Commission (led by Prof. Mario Monti), started investigating Microsoft&#x27;s dominant position in the desktop operating systems. The Free Software Foundation Europe was invited by the EC to represent the stance of the Free Software movement. In 2004 FSFE was admitted as an intervening third party in the appeal against the decision of the Commission and, also representing the Samba Team, was one of the only two interveners to remain active in the proceedings from start to end. It provided strong evidence in court thanks to the effort of volunteers like Andrew Tridgell, Jeremy Allison, Volker Lendeke and their lawyer, Carlo Piana. The case is now considered one of the leading cases in European antitrust.
* World Intellectual Property Organization: The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is one of 16 specialized agencies of the United Nations system of organisations. Its role is to administer 24 international treaties dealing with different aspects of limited monopolies on knowledge. As an observer to WIPO and together with a global coalition of other players with similar goals, FSFE is working towards reshaping it as a &quot;World Intellectual Wealth Organization.&quot;
*FSFE Legal Team (previously known as the Freedom Task Force): The legal branch of FSFE that helps individuals, projects, businesses and government agencies find Free Software legal information, experts and support. FSFE Legal provides compliance, best practice, procurement and governance resources in-house, in partnership with FSFE&#x27;s associate organizations and through its extensive network of contacts (including the Legal Network). Its mission is to spread knowledge, solve problems and encourage the long-term growth of Free Software. The FSFE Legal Team is also responsible for maintaining the Fiduciary License Agreement, a balanced Contributor License Agreement that makes sure the project remains Free Software.
*The REUSE Software: This project provides a consistent way to add licensing and copyright information to the source code of a project. It is based on the SPDX license identifier and allows automating many processes involved in licensing compliance. REUSE is currently being adopted by many big open source projects, for example KDE.

Each month, FSFE publishes a newsletter, in multiple languages (including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish), of their activities that can be mentioned in public.

==Structure==
From FSFE&#x27;s published &quot;Self-Conception&quot;:

Internally, the FSFE has a consensus-oriented team structure, in which participation is determined by each person&#x27;s willingness to participate and do work. A democratic and representative-democratic model functions as a fallback when the consensus-based approach accomplishes no results, or when a quick decision is needed.

===Legal structure===
The FSFE has a modular legal structure with a central &quot;Hub&quot; organization and the possibility of local legal bodies, called &quot;chapters&quot;. The Hub is a charitable association (&quot;e.V.&quot;) which is registered in Germany.

As well as being in regular contact with other FSFs — Free Software Foundation India (FSFI), Free Software Foundation Latin America (FSFLA) — FSFE has a structure of organizations which are official associates. These are mostly national-level free software groups.

===Awards===
In 2010, FSFE received the Theodor Heuss Medal in recognition of its work for freedom in the information society. The medal is awarded once a year in Stuttgart by a non-partisan foundation named after West Germany&#x27;s first president.

<text>A personal firewall is an application which controls network traffic to and from a computer, permitting or denying communications based on a security policy. Typically it works as an application layer firewall.

A personal firewall differs from a conventional firewall in terms of scale. A personal firewall will usually protect only the computer on which it is installed, as compared to a conventional firewall which is normally installed on a designated interface between two or more networks, such as a router or proxy server. Hence, personal firewalls allow a security policy to be defined for individual computers, whereas a conventional firewall controls the policy between the networks that it connects.

The per-computer scope of personal firewalls is useful to protect machines that are moved across different networks. For example, a laptop computer may be used on a trusted intranet at a workplace where minimal protection is needed as a conventional firewall is already in place, and services that require open ports such as file and printer sharing are useful. The same laptop could be used at public Wi-Fi hotspots, where it may be necessary to decide the level of trust and reconfigure firewall settings to limit traffic to and from the computer. A firewall can be configured to allow different security policies for each network.

Unlike network firewalls, many personal firewalls are able to control network traffic allowed to programs on the secured computer. When an application attempts an outbound connection, the firewall may block it if blacklisted, or ask the user whether to blacklist it if it is not yet known. This protects against malware implemented as an executable program. Personal firewalls may also provide some level of intrusion detection, allowing the software to terminate or block connectivity where it suspects an intrusion is being attempted.

== Features ==
Common personal firewall features:
* Block or alert the user about all unauthorized inbound or outbound connection attempts.
* Allows the user to control which programs can and cannot access the local network and/or Internet and provide the user with information about an application that makes a connection attempt.
* Hide the computer from port scans by not responding to unsolicited network traffic.
* Monitor applications that are listening for incoming connections.
* Monitor and regulate all incoming and outgoing Internet users.
* Prevent unwanted network traffic from locally installed applications.
* Provide information about the destination server with which an application is attempting to communicate.
* Track recent incoming events, outgoing events, and intrusion events to see who has accessed or tried to access your computer.
* Blocks and prevents hacking attempt or attack from hackers.

== Limitations ==
Firewalls help protecting internal network from hackers, However firewall do have some limitations.

* If the system has been compromised by malware, spyware or similar software, these programs can also manipulate the firewall, because both are running on the same system. It may be possible to bypass or even completely shut down software firewalls in such a manner.
* A firewall can&#x27;t notify, if it has been incorrectly configured.
* Firewall may limit access from the Internet, but it may not protect your network from wireless and other access to your systems.
* Firewalls and Virtual Private Networks are not the only solution to secure private documents and emails that are either sent within an organization or to other business contacts that are outside the organization.
* The alerts generated can possibly desensitize users to alerts by warning the user of actions that may not be malicious.
* Software firewalls that interface with the operating system or with other firewalls or security software at the kernel mode level may potentially cause instability and/or introduce security flaws.

== History ==
In the mid 1990s, as a part of the information security architecture project for a Fortune 100 corporation in the United States (the Anheuser-Busch Corporation), one of the members of the three-man architectural development team came up with a concept with regards to improving the overall security of the operating system to be used on all the computers within this networked system (a network system referred to as BudNET). Improving the overall security of an operating system is commonly referred to as &quot;OS Hardening.&quot; The member of the team that was charged with this was SSgt. Donald R. Woeltje Jr. and the concept he came up with was the installation of special software (firewall software) on every BudNET server, workstation, and perimeter security device. Indeed, every single Windows system on the BudNET network. This is a concept that is now commonly referred to as &quot;personal firewall&quot; software. So, while SSgt. Woeltje did not invent personal firewall software, he did invent the idea of the &quot;personal firewall.&quot; Evidence of this fact exists in the Anheuser-Busch Security Model Proposal document made by SSgt. Woeltje, at the time. When SSgt. Woeltje brought in all the leading firewall vendors for meetings concerning the products being considered for use for the perimeter security of the BudNET network, SSgt. Woeltje brought up the concept of the &quot;personal firewall&quot; with the vendors and asked them if they had any firewall product that could be used in this way. With the exception of the representatives from the Cyberguard Corporation, every vendor said that not only did that not have any firewall software that could be used in this way but they also said that the idea was crazy and unworkable. But, today we know they were wrong because the use of personal firewall software has become a de facto computer security standard. The companies that SSgt. Woeltje discussed &quot;personal firewall&quot; software with were, among others, Cisco, Checkpoint, Axent Technologies, Milkyway Networks, Cyberguard, Network ONE, Trusted Information Systems, and Secure Computing Corporation.

<doc id="450403" wikidata="Q6906903" url="?curid=450403" title="Monument to the Royal Stuarts">
<text>The Monument to the Royal Stuarts is a memorial in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican City State. It commemorates the last three members of the Royal House of Stuart: James Francis Edward Stuart (&quot;the Old Pretender&quot;, d. 1766), his elder son Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;the Young Pretender&quot; or &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;, d. 1788), and his younger son, Henry Benedict Stuart (&quot;the Cardinal Duke of York&quot;, d. 1807). The Jacobites recognised these three as kings of England, Scotland and Ireland.

The marble monument is by Antonio Canova (1757–1822), the most celebrated Italian sculptor of his day. It was erected in 1819.

==Description==
The monument takes the form of a truncated obelisk. It carries bas relief profile portraits of the three exiled princes, and the following inscription:

Below the inscription are two weeping angels, symbolising the lost hopes of the exiled Stuarts.

The monument to the Royal Stuarts was originally commissioned by Monsignor Angelo Cesarini, executor of the estate of Henry Benedict Stuart. Among the subscribers, curiously, was King George IV, who (once the Jacobite threat to his throne had ended with the death of Cardinal Stuart in 1807) was an admirer of the Stuart legend.

The monument stands towards the back of the basilica in the left aisle opposite the door from which people coming down the spiral staircase from the dome and roof exit. It is frequently adorned with flowers by Jacobite romantics.

==Burials==

The monument is, strictly speaking, a cenotaph, not a tomb. The three Stuarts are buried in the crypt below the basilica. James Francis Edward Stuart was buried here at his death in 1766. When Charles Edward Stuart died in 1788, he was buried in the Basilica of St Peter Apostle in Frascati. When his brother Henry Benedict Stuart died in 1807, both brothers were laid to rest next to their father in the crypt of St. Peter&#x27;s. Three separate tombstones were erected on the site.

Until 1938 the bodies of the three Stuarts were buried where the tomb of Pius XI now stands. In that year the bodies were moved slightly further east on the left side of the crypt, to make room for Pius&#x27;s tomb. In 1939 a single sarcophagus was erected over the three graves. On top of the sarcophagus is a bronze pillow on which is placed a bronze crown. On the front of the sarcophagus is the same inscription quoted above.

==Other monuments==
Opposite the monument to the Royal Stuarts in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is a monument to Maria Clementina Sobieska, wife of James Francis Edward Stuart and mother of Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart. Its inscription reads:

Queen Christina of Sweden, the only other monarch with a memorial in the church, also lies entombed in the crypt below the basilica, with the Royal Stuarts. She abdicated her throne in 1654 to convert to Catholicism.

<text>Helmut Zacharias (27 January 192028 February 2002) was a German violinist and composer who created over 400 works and sold 14 million records. He also appeared in a number of films, usually playing musicians.

==Early life==
Helmut Zacharias was born in Berlin. His father Karl was a violinist and conductor, and his mother was a singer. He started having lessons from his father at the age of 2 and a half and at 6 he played at the Faun club, a cabaret venue on the Friedrichstraße in Berlin.

At the age of 8, Zacharias became the youngest student in Gustav Havemann&#x27;s masterclass at the Berlin Academy of Music. Aged 11, he played on radio for the first time with a performance of Mozart&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 3 in G major and began touring in 1934 at the age of 14. At this time, in the 1930s, the records of Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli&#x27;s all-string jazz band were available in Germany and they heavily influenced Zacharias&#x27;s musical style.

==Musical career==
In 1940, Zacharias was discovered by Lindström-Electrola (then-name of the German branch of EMI) and in 1941 had his first mainstream success with &quot;Schönes Wetter Heute&quot;. By the 1950s, he was considered to be one of the best jazz violinists of Europe and was dubbed &quot;The Magic Violinist&quot; and &quot;Germany&#x27;s Mr. Violin&quot;. In 1956 he achieved his greatest success in the United States with the release of &quot;When the White Lilacs Bloom Again&quot; which, on 22 September, reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

On 21 November 1964 he reached number 9 in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Tokyo Melody&quot; following its use as theme music for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Zacharias moved to Switzerland in the late 1950s and continued playing with many other famous artists, including Yehudi Menuhin. From 1968 to 1973 he appeared in his own television show. In 1985, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

==Death==
Zacharias had been detected as suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1995 and retired from public life in 1997 before the fact was publicly acknowledged on World Alzheimer&#x27;s Day in 2000. He died in 2002 in Brissago, Switzerland and is buried in Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.

==Personal life==
Zacharias was married to Hella (&quot;née&quot; Konradat) from 1943 until his death. Together they had two sons, Stephan and Thomas, and a daughter, Sylvia. Stephan, born in 1956, is a composer whose credits include the soundtrack to Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Downfall&quot;, while Thomas was an international athlete.

<text>The astral body is a subtle body posited by many philosophers, intermediate between the intelligent soul and the mental body, composed of a subtle material. In many recensions the concept ultimately derives from the philosophy of Plato though the same or similar ideas have existed all over the world well before Plato&#x27;s time: it is related to an astral plane, which consists of the planetary heavens of astrology. The term was adopted by nineteenth-century Theosophists and neo-Rosicrucians.

The idea is rooted in common worldwide religious accounts of the afterlife in which the soul&#x27;s journey or &quot;ascent&quot; is described in such terms as &quot;an ecstatic.., mystical or out-of body experience, wherein the spiritual traveller leaves the physical body and travels in his/her subtle body (or dreambody or astral body) into &#x27;higher&#x27; realms&quot;. Hence &quot;the &quot;many kinds of &#x27;heavens&#x27;, &#x27;hells&#x27;, and purgatorial existences believed in by followers of innumerable religions&quot; may also be understood as astral phenomena, as may the various &quot;phenomena of the séance room&quot;. The phenomenon of apparitional experience is therefore related, as is made explicit in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;.

The astral body is sometimes said to be visible as an aura of swirling colours. It is widely linked today with out-of-body experiences or astral projection. Where this refers to a supposed movement around the real world, as in Muldoon and Carrington&#x27;s book &quot;The Projection of the Astral Body&quot;, it conforms to Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s usage of the term. Elsewhere, this latter is termed &quot;etheric&quot;, while &quot;astral&quot; denotes an experience of dream-symbols, archetypes, memories, spiritual beings and visionary landscapes.

==History==
===The classical world===

Neoplatonists agreed with Plato as to the immortality of the rational soul but disagreed as to whether man&#x27;s &quot;irrational soul&quot; was immortal and celestial (&quot;starry&quot;, hence astral) or whether it remained on earth and dissolved after death. The late Neoplatonist Proclus, who is credited the first to speak of subtle &quot;planes&quot;, posited two subtle bodies or &quot;carriers&quot; (&quot;okhema&quot;) intermediate between the rational soul and the physical body. These were; 1) the astral vehicle which was the immortal vehicle of the Soul and 2) the spiritual (&quot;pneuma&quot;) vehicle, aligned with the vital breath, which he considered mortal.

The word &quot;astral&quot; means &quot;of the stars&quot;, thus the astral plane, consisting of the celestial spheres, is held to be an astrological phenomenon: &quot;The whole of the astral portion of our earth and of the physical planets, together with the purely astral planets of our System, make up collectively the astral body of the Solar Logos&quot;. There are &quot;seven types of astral matter&quot; by means of which &quot;psychic changes occur periodically&quot;.

===The Modern Era===
Such ideas greatly influenced medieval religious thought and are visible in the Renaissance medicine of Paracelsus and Servetus. In the romantic era, alongside the discovery of electromagnetism and the nervous system, there came a new interest in the spirit world. Franz Anton Mesmer spoke of the stars, animal magnetism and magnetic fluids. In 1801, the English occultist Francis Barrett wrote of a herb&#x27;s &quot;excellent astral and magnetic powers&quot; – for herbalists had categorised herbs according to their supposed correspondence with the seven planetary influences.

In the mid-nineteenth century the French occultist Eliphas Levi wrote much of &quot;the astral light&quot;, a factor he considered of key importance to magic, alongside the power of will and the doctrine of correspondences. He considered the astral light the medium of all light, energy and movement, describing it in terms that recall both Mesmer and the luminiferous ether.

Levi&#x27;s idea of the astral was to have much influence in the English-speaking world through the teachings of The Golden Dawn, but it was also taken up by Helena Blavatsky and discussed in the key work of Theosophy, &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;. Levi seems to have been regarded by later Theosophists as the immediate source from which the term was adopted into their sevenfold schema of planes and bodies, though there was slight confusion as to the term&#x27;s proper use.

===Theosophy===
Blavatsky frequently used the term &quot;astral body&quot; in connection with the Indian &quot;linga sharira&quot; which is one of the seven principles of human life. However, she said that &quot;there are various astral bodies&quot;. For example, she talked of one as being constituted by &quot;the lower manas and volition, kama&quot; According to the Theosophical founder William Q. Judge &quot;There are many names for the Astral Body. Here are a few: Linga Sarira, Sanskrit, meaning design body, and the best one of all; ethereal double; phantom; wraith; apparition; doppelgänger; personal man; perispirit; irrational soul; animal soul; Bhuta; elementary; spook; devil; demon. Some of these apply only to the astral body when devoid of the corpus after death.&quot;

C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant (Theosophical Society Adyar), equated it with Blavatsky&#x27;s &quot;Kama&quot; (desire) principle and called it the &quot;Emotional body&quot;. &quot;Astral body&quot;, &quot;desire body&quot;, and &quot;emotional body&quot; became synonymous, and this identification is found in later Theosophically inspired thought. The astral body in later Theosophy is &quot;the vehicle of feelings and emotions&quot; through which &quot;it is possible...to experience all varieties of desire&quot;. We have a &quot;life in the astral body, whilst the physical body is wrapped in slumber&quot;. So the astral body &quot;provides a simple explanation of the mechanism of many phenomena revealed by modern psycho-analysis&quot;. To this extent, then, the &quot;astral body&quot; is a reification of the dream-world self.

===Post-theosophists===

According to Max Heindel&#x27;s Rosicrucian writings, the Desire body is made of desire stuff, from which human beings form feelings and emotions. It is said to appear to spiritual sight as an ovoid cloud extending from sixteen to twenty inches beyond the physical body. It has a number of whirling vortices (chakras) and from the main vortex, in the region of the liver, there is a constant flow which radiates and returns. The desire body exhibits colors that vary in every person according to his or her temperament and mood.

However, the astral body (or &quot;Soul body&quot;) must be evolved by means of the work of transmutation and will eventually be evolved by humanity as a whole. According to Heindel, the term &quot;astral body&quot; was employed by the mediaeval Alchemists because of the ability it conferred to traverse the &quot;starry&quot; regions. The &quot;Astral body&quot; is regarded as the &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; or &quot;Living Stone&quot; of the alchemist, the &quot;Wedding Garment&quot; of the Gospel of Matthew and the &quot;Soul body&quot; that Paul mentions in the First Epistle to the Corinthians

Many other popular accounts of post-Theosophical ideas appeared in the late 20th century. Barbara Brennan&#x27;s &quot;Hands of Light&quot; distinguishes between the emotional body and the astral body. She sees these as two distinct layers in the seven-layered &quot;Human Energy Field&quot;. The emotional body pertains to the physical universe, the astral body to the astral world. The Mother sometimes referred to the astral body and experiences on the astral plane. The Indian master Osho occasionally made use of a modified Theosophical terminology.

According to Samael Aun Weor, who popularised Theosophical thought in Latin America, the astral body is the part of human soul related to emotions, represented by the sephirah Hod in the kabbalistic Tree of Life. However the common person only has a kamarupa, body of desire or &quot;lunar astral body,&quot; a body related to animal emotions, passions and desires, while the true human emotional vehicle is the solar astral body, which can be crystallised through Tantric sex. The solar astral body is the first mediator between the Cosmic Christ, Chokmah, and the individual human soul.

===Fourth Way===
&quot;What is called the &#x27;body-Kesdjan&#x27;, or, as they themselves later began to name this being-part of theirs—of which, by the way, contemporary beings know only by hearsay—the &#x27;Astral-body&#x27;.&quot;
&quot;At first on the planet itself the &#x27;second-being-body,&#x27; i.e., the body-Kesdjan, together with the &#x27;third-being-body&#x27; separate themselves from the &#x27;fundamental-planetary-body&#x27; and, leaving this planetary body on the planet, rise both together to that sphere where those cosmic substances— from the localizations of which the body-Kesdjan of a being arises—have their place of concentration.
“And only there, at the end of a certain time, does the principal and final sacred Rascooarno occur to this two-natured arising, after which such a &#x27;higher being-part&#x27; indeed becomes an independent individual with its own individual Reason.&quot;
According to Gurdjieff it is an independent arising which is intermediate between the physical body and the Soul.

Gurdjieff refers to the astral body as the &quot;body Kesdjan&quot; or &quot;vessel of the soul&quot;: it is of the sun and all planets, just as the physical body is of the earth. While it is not developed one is a &quot;human being only in quotation marks&quot;, who cannot be considered in any meaningful sense to have a soul and who will &quot;die like a dog&quot;.

==Scientific reception==

Donovan Rawcliffe, who noted there is no scientific evidence for an astral body, has written that &quot;delusions and hallucinations due to acenesthesia or hysteria have undoubtedly helped to perpetuate the myth of the astral body.&quot;

<text>The Betar Movement (), also spelled Beitar (), is a Revisionist Zionist youth movement founded in 1923 in Riga, Latvia, by Vladimir (Ze&#x27;ev) Jabotinsky. It was one of several right-wing youth movements that arose at that time and adopted special salutes and uniforms influenced by fascism.

During World War II, Betar was a source of recruits for both Jewish regiments that fought alongside the British and Jewish groups fighting against the British in Mandatory Palestine. Betar was traditionally linked to the original Herut and then Likud political parties of Jewish pioneers, and was closely affiliated with the Revisionist Zionist militant group Irgun. Some of the most prominent politicians of Israel were Betarim in their youth, most notably prime ministers Yitzhak Shamir and Menachem Begin.

The group has faced controversy over its support for Zionist terrorism and Kahanism, a movement that calls for segregation of non-Jews. The organization, which Haaretz says is tied to Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s Likud party, has been blacklisted by the Anti-Defamation League for its embrace of &quot;Islamophobia [and] harras[ing] Muslims.&quot;

==Etymology==
The name Betar בית&quot;ר refers both to Betar (fortress), the last Jewish fort to fall in the Bar Kokhba revolt and to the altered abbreviation of the Hebrew name of the organisation, &quot;Berit Trumpeldor&quot; or &quot;Brit Yosef Trumpeldor&quot; ( ברית יוסף תרומפלדור, &quot;Joseph Trumpeldor Alliance&quot;), named after Joseph Trumpeldor. Although Trumpeldor&#x27;s name is properly spelt with &quot;tet&quot; (ט), it was written with &quot;taf&quot; (ת) so as to produce the acronym.

==History==

Betar was founded by Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky at a meeting of Jewish youth in Riga, Latvia, arranged by in 1923. Jabotinsky spoke of the Arab attacks on the settlement of Tel Hai and other Jewish settlements in the Galilee. He believed that these incidents, indicative of serious threats to the Jewish Palestinians, could only be addressed by the recreation of the ancient Jewish state of Israel, extending across the entirety of both Palestine and Jordan. This is the defining philosophy of Revisionist Zionism. Jabotinsky proposed creating Betar to foster a new generation of Jews thoroughly indoctrinated in these nationalist ideals and trained for military action against all enemies of Judaism. In 1931, Jabotinsky was elected &quot;rosh Betar&quot; (&quot;head of Betar&quot;) at the first world conference in Danzig.

Joseph Trumpeldor, the leader of the Jewish settlers who were killed at Tel Hai in 1920, served as the primary role model of the Betar. A disabled man with only one arm, he led his people in the futile defense of the settlement and reportedly died with the words, &quot;Never mind, it is good to die for our country&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;אין דבר ,טוב למות בעד ארצנו&quot;). This was particularly significant given that the Jews did not yet have a country: Trumpeldor was referring to sacrificing one&#x27;s life in order to further the establishment of an independent Jewish state. The words of &quot;Shir Betar&quot; (&quot;The Betar Song&quot;), written by Jabotinsky, include a line that quotes Trumpeldor&#x27;s last words of &quot;never mind&quot;. As the song expresses, Betar youth were to be as &quot;proud, generous, and fierce [alternately translated as &#x27;cruel&#x27;]&quot; as Trumpeldor, and as ready to sacrifice themselves for Israel.
Despite resistance from both Zionist and non-Zionist Jews, Betar quickly gained a large following in Poland, Palestine, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and elsewhere. It was particularly successful in Poland, which had the largest Jewish population in Europe at the time.

In 1934, Poland was home to 40,000 of Betar&#x27;s 70,000 members. Routine Betar activities in Warsaw included military drilling, instruction in Hebrew, and encouragement to learn English. Militia groups organized by Betar Poland helped to defend against attacks by the anti-Semitic ONR. The interwar Polish government helped Betar with military training.
Some members admired the Polish nationalist camp and imitated some of its aspects.


From 1937 to 1944, Betar aided the widespread immigration of Jews to Palestine in violation of the British Mandate&#x27;s immigration quotas, which had not been increased despite the surge of refugees from the Nazi persecution and murder of Jews. In total, as part of Operation Action, Betar was, according to one of its organisers, William R. Perl, partly responsible for smuggling an estimated 40,000 Jews into Palestine under such restrictions.

During World War II, Betar members, including former Polish Army officers, founded &quot;Żydowski Związek Wojskowy&quot; (ŻZW; &quot;Jewish Military Union&quot;), which fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Mordechai Anielewicz, the head of the other major uprising group, &quot;Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa&quot; (ZOB; &quot;Jewish Combat Organization&quot;), also gained his military training in Betar. He was the secretary of the prominent Betar Warsaw organization in 1938. He left it to join and quickly take leadership of the left-wing Zionist Hashomer Hatzair group in Warsaw.

In the summer of 1941, Julek (Joel/Jakób) Brandt, a Betar leader from Chorzów who was a relative of Samuel Brandt, the chairman of the Hrubieszów Judenrat (Jewish Council), arranged for several hundred Betar members from the Warsaw Ghetto to work on local farms and estates, including one in Dłużniów and Werbkowice. Most of the Betar youth were killed in the spring of 1942 and in subsequent months, together with the local Jewish population. A small number, however, returned to the ghetto and later took part in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in the ranks of the ŻZW. Brandt escaped from a transport heading for the death camp at Sobibor. He was denounced by local peasants who turned him over to the Gestapo in Hrubieszów. There, he was put to work by Gestapo Obersturmbannführer Ebner, who named him chief of a small work camp. At the end of 1942 or the beginning of 1943, Ebner shot and killed him.

Jewish fighters under the leadership of Josef Glazman, head of Betar Lithuania, battled the Nazis alongside the Lithuanian partisans in the forests outside Vilnius; anti-Nazi partisans in most other nations, however, were unwilling to fight alongside Betar. &quot;The Song Of The Partisans&quot;, an anthem traditionally sung by Holocaust survivors on Yom HaShoah, was written in memory of and dedication to Glazman.

In 1938, David Raziel became the head of both Betar and the &quot;Irgun Zvai Leumi&quot; (&quot;National Military Organisation&quot;, known as &quot;Etzel&quot;). The Irgun&#x27;s anthem was the third and final verse of the Betar song. Raziel died shortly into World War II, while taking part in Iraq in the Habbaniyeh area of Anbar Province in a failed British sabotage mission against German interests.

The tactics of the Irgun-Betar coalition were at odds with the mainstream Zionist establishment&#x27;s policy of restraint in response to Arab attacks. Throughout most of the 1930s and &#x27;40s, the two organizations typically bombed collections of Arab civilians in response to any attack of any kind on any Palestinian Jews. The Irgun worked closely with Betar in Palestine and worldwide, particularly with respect to illegal immigration into Palestine, but they remained organizationally and structurally separate. As British policy and Jewish needs/demands grew more opposed, Betar and the Irgun stepped up their military campaign against the British, based primarily on guerrilla tactics of sabotage and assassination.
With the outbreak of World War II, Raziel and Jabotinsky declared an unconditional ceasefire against the British, as Britain and the Zionists had a common enemy in Germany. Raziel&#x27;s second-in-command, Avraham &quot;Yair&quot; Stern, broke away and formed the Stern Group, later renamed LEHI (&quot;Lohamei Herut Yisrael&quot;, &quot;Freedom Fighters For Israel&quot;), which continued to attack British targets. Radical elements of Betar joined LEHI but most stayed with the Irgun.

Future Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who had headed Betar Poland prior to World War II, reached Palestine at the war&#x27;s end and took immediate control of both Betar Palestine and the Irgun. He led the two organizations in their contribution to the 1948–49 war that established the initial borders of the newly proclaimed state of Israel. Betar and the Irgun remained functionally intermingled, consistently sharing leadership and manpower. By contrast, the Haganah, the official defense organization of the Jewish Agency, and its military wing, the Palmach, had practically no Betar members.

Members of Betar were also instrumental in setting up Israel&#x27;s navy, the Israeli Sea Corps. The first Israeli plane was flown into Palestine by Jabotinsky&#x27;s son, Eri, at the time a member of the Betar World Executive.

Many of Israel&#x27;s most prominent conservatives have been &quot;graduates&quot; of Betar, including former prime ministers Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Shamir, and Ehud Olmert, and former Defense Minister Moshe Arens. Former Likud/Kadima minister (in several offices) Tzipi Livni MK was a youth Betarist. Yoel Hasson MK was formerly national head of Betar in Israel. Livni and Hasson later formed Hatnuah, which in 2015 allied with Labor in the center-left Zionist Union. Israel&#x27;s current Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, is a Betarist and a former leader of the World Betar Organization.

Since the 1970s, Betar has suffered a decline in membership and activities. It remains much involved in Zionist activism, however. Tagar, Betar&#x27;s young adult movement, was active on many university campuses throughout North America during the 1980s, as part of the Revisionist Zionist Association, and Betar played a major part in raising the awareness of Soviet oppression of Jews, and fighting for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel. It remains relatively prominent in Australia and in Cleveland, Ohio.

In the early 21st century, Betar had around 21,000 members globally.

Most recently, in 2014, Betar organized marches and demonstrations in France, to protest the rise in anti-semitic incidents there, including attacks against synagogues and individual Jews. At those marches, some Betar members displayed the emblem formerly used by the Jewish Defense League.

==Regional activities==

===Israel===

Once a vibrant movement tied to the opposition Herut Party, Betar&#x27;s following in Israel has declined since the 1970s due to a generally transformed political landscape. An important change has been the rise of religious conservatives in Israel. Though Betar had many of the same political goals as the rapidly growing Gush Emunim (&quot;Bloc of the Faithful&quot;) and Bnei Akiva youth movements (tied to the National Religious Party), they remained a secular movement. They did not join the latter organizations in seeking annexation of the contested West Bank and Gaza Strip. During the 1980s, as a result of the Camp David Accords negotiated by Menachem Begin (the leader of Herut and its successor movement Likud), a similar effect occurred due to the rise of the &quot;Secular Right&quot;. The more extreme movements drew youth away from Betar.

As the Likud party under Benjamin Netanyahu moved away from the traditional values of Revisionist Zionism, Betar drew criticism from Israeli conservatives who identified as ideological purists. While Betar had consistently been a source of powerful political figures in Israel, its leaders were criticized for placing partisan political expediency above greater ideological priorities. In the late 1990s, Benny Begin broke away from Likud to form Herut – The National Movement.

===Canada===
Betar Toronto currently focuses on opposing the Israeli apartheid analogy. In February 2006 at the University of Toronto, Tagar organized a &quot;Know Radical Islam Week&quot; featuring activist Nonie Darwish, former Sudanese slave Simon Deng, Dr. Salim Mansur (a Muslim activist speaking on gay rights in the Middle East), and presentations by Honest Reporting and Palestinian Media Watch.

 The event was also co-sponsored by the Toronto Secular Alliance and other allied groups. Betar has also worked in Toronto and Montreal with off-campus organizations, such as the Canadian Coalition for Democracies, to promote the importance of secular and participatory politics in Canada. In March 2007, Betar-Tagar at the University of Toronto changed its name to &#x27;Zionists at U of T&#x27;.

Betar-Tagar was active in Montreal and Toronto during the 1980s Lebanon-Israel conflict. A revival of Betar occurred in Montreal on November 9, 2006, as an event entitled &quot;Taking Liberties: Terrorism in the West&quot;. It featured keynote speaker Dr. Salim Mansur and was the first film screening of &quot;&quot; at McGill University. It was co-organized with Conservative McGill students. At McGill University in March 2007, Betar Montreal held a &quot;Radical Islam Awareness Week&quot; similar to the one at the University of Toronto the year before. Speakers included David B. Harris, a Canadian lawyer and security specialist, and John Thompson of the Mackenzie Institute. Concurrent with the 2007 Montreal program, Betar in Toronto held &quot;Freedom and Democracy Week&quot; at the University of Toronto. Speakers included Ezra Levant, co-founder of the &quot;Western Standard&quot; newspaper, and Jonah Goldberg of the &quot;National Review.&quot;

===United States===

The first branch of Betar in the United States was founded in October 1929, led principally by Joseph Beder, William Katz, Haim Messer, and Israel Posnansky. Beder had visited Palestine under the Mandate in the spring of 1929 and come in contact with Betar members there. The first activity of Betar USA was a Hanukkah party alongside local branches which existed already in eastern New York and the Lower East Side.

When the USSR imprisoned the ailing Dr. Mikhail Stern because his sons were openly Zionist, seven Betarim from New York City went to the USSR and offered to and serve his sentence in his stead. The Soviet government refused their proposal and deported them. The group was led by Fred Pierce and included Elie Yossef and Gilad Freund.

Betar maintains a Shaliach in New York City and Cleveland, Ohio. The Cleveland chapter offers a fall and spring camp that is open to all cities. Betar offers summer and winter tours of Israel. It is one of the few movements that offer students a chance to visit the West Bank. Both programs allow students to spend time at Kedumin, Itamar, Alon Moreh East Jerusalem, and Hebron. They have officially adopted Kedumin as a sister city and spend an extensive time volunteering there. The winter tour is for college-age students and runs in late December.

During the period of the early to mid 90s, Ronn Torossian served as National President and increased Betar USA membership into the hundreds. Previous leadership in the U.S. included; Roey Urman, Glenn Mones, Barry Liben, Fred Pierce (early to mid 70s), and Benny Rosen (60s). In addition to its programs for younger students, Betar USA also has an affiliated program for college-age students called Tagar. Betar strongly promotes the emigration of American Jews to Israel.

Previous Shaliachs in the U.S. have included Sallai Meridor, former Israel Ambassador to the U.S. (late 1980s); Eli Cohen, former Israel Ambassador to Japan (early 1990s); Tova Vagimi; Sharon Tzur; Yitzhak Kerstein; Shlomo Ariav; and Shlomi Levy.

===United Kingdom===
Betar UK existed in the late 1930s but had ceased functioning when the state of Israel was established. The movement&#x27;s revitalization began in 1974 with Eli Joseph with the assistance of Eric Graus and George Evnine. Yisrael Medad of the World Betar Movement arrived in the UK in 1975 and built a winter camp at Sherborne School in Dorset, England, a summer camp in north-west France, and a two-week summer camp in Israel. Branches were opened in various locations in Greater London and elsewhere. Educational and cultural activities were organized and demonstrations were held on the themes of Soviet Jewry and Jews in Arab lands as well as on local British issues. Betar shared offices with the Herut Movement at 73, Compayne Gardens, London, at the &quot;Tel Chai House&quot;. When that property was sold, Betar held its meetings at various locations in Stamford Hill and other Greater London areas.

Anti-Zionist demonstrations and BDS picketing occurred weekly outside the flagship Marks &amp; Spencer store on Oxford Street in London from 2004 until 2010. Betar and Tagar UK organised and led a weekly pro-Israel counter-demonstration during that period.

Betar lost its registered charity status in 2004 when the Charity Commission for England and Wales stated that Betar &quot;appeared to be in furtherance of a political purpose rather than a charitable purpose&quot;.

Many of Betar’s members have emigrated to Israel over the years. Betar UK currently has a small active group of around 150 members, mainly in London. It is involved in Zionist activism, self-defence and martial arts training, government lobbying, criticism of what its members regard as biased, anti-Israel articles in media, and organises and supports pro-Israel demonstrations. Its website has not been updated for a number of years but Betar members are still known to be active and are considering permanent headquarters in London.

===Australia===
Betar Australia is an active movement with branches in Melbourne, Sydney, and Queensland. Each of these branches organizes many activities, functions, and Jewish youth camps in each state. Betar Australia is a member of the Australasian Zionist Youth Council.

Betar Australia was initially established in Melbourne and branched out to New South Wales (Sydney) and Queensland (Brisbane). In 1948, Betar members from Harbin, China and elsewhere reestablished Betar in Melbourne to help provide refuge for the many Jewish survivors of the Holocaust who remained without assistance. Later, in 1953, Betar expanded to Sydney where Betar NSW was established by Jewish immigrants from China such as their first mefaked (director) Hans Dreyer and Bob Shteinman. Further, Betar expanded to Canberra and Brisbane, although the Canberra branch did not continue to stay active. The Queensland branch celebrated its 50th reunion in 2006.

The Sydney movement has experienced various periods of expansion and contraction, reaching its zenith in the early 1990s. During that time, winter camps regularly attracted over 220 &quot;chanichim&quot; (campers). Summer camps were also large, often held in conjunction with the rest of Betar Australia. Several federal camps were held during that time, including Jamboree in Toowoomba, Queensland. Betar Australia also holds annual seminars for senior members as well as educational and training conventions for its senior leaders.

Betar has been at the forefront of Jewish activism in Australia. Betar Australia began protesting Nazi supporters and sympathizers in 1952, when it released pigeons and stink bombs during a concert by allegedly pro-Nazi German pianist Walter Gieseking in Melbourne. The group battled neo-Nazi groups in the 1960s, and in the 1970s and 1980s, it spearheaded the protests of the Sydney Jewish community on behalf of Soviet Jewry. The group was instrumental in supporting the annual protest outside the Soviet Consulate in Trelawney Street, Woollahra, which occurred each Pesach, and has supported mass protests outside the Bolshoi Ballet and the Moscow Circus on Ice at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. It also protested Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s visit to Canberra and Sydney. In the 1970s, the group demonstrated against a visit of the General Union of Palestine Students to the Australian Union of Students after the latter had moved to the political left. In later years, Betar Australia took the initiative to organize community protests outside the Iraqi Embassy in Canberra during the Gulf War and outside the Iranian Embassy to protest Iranian state sponsorship of terrorism. The group also marched in front of the German Consulate in Sydney to protest what it perceived to be a resurgence of anti-Semitism in postwar Germany. In 2004, Betar Sydney was active in protesting Dr. Hanan Ashrawi&#x27;s receiving of the Sydney Premier&#x27;s peace prize.

Australia Betarim leaders very often emigrate to Israel and maintain close relations between the two nations. Betar Australia sends several members to Israel&#x27;s &quot;hasbarah&quot; programs each year. This pilgrimage is generally made after the completion of year 12 and the program spans the course of a year. After completing the program, the leaders are considered to be, &quot;Bogrim&quot; a more senior title for a youth leader.

===South Africa===
Once one of the largest youth movements in South Africa, Betar South Africa has since dwindled greatly. Headquartered in Johannesburg, the group used to host a 3-week summer camp each December and annual programs to send youth to Israel. Like Betar Australia, Betar South Africa saw many of its members permanently emigrate to Israel.

===Brazil===
Betar Brasil is an active movement with branches in Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. Each of these branches organize consistent activities, events, both summer and winter camps (Machanot) as well as a lot of other community initiatives. There are also frequent National Seminars and some activities are carried out by all three maozim together. Betar has gained significant strength in Brazil by the end of the 2010s decade and seems to continue growing considerably. In 2018, the Betar branch in Rio de Janeiro was officially inaugurated, under the leadership of Theodor Fuchs, Nicholas Beznos, Gabriel Uram, Guilherme Jaffé, Felipe Lazkani, Gabriela Sznajderman, Eduardo Oliven, Bernardo Press, Bruno Sznajderman, Gabriel Kac Nigri, Paulo Orenbuch, Davi Beznos, Caio Cohen, and Victor Cohen. By 2019 São Paulo&#x27;s branch was established too, with the leadership of Marcos Zlotnik, Raphael Harari, David Breslauer and Ilan Charchat. The revival of Betar Brasil was only possible with the help of Juliana Katz, Mono Sommer (World Betar&#x27;s Rosh Chinuch), and Nerya Meir (CEO of World Betar). In 2020, the first Hanagah Artzit was formed after decades. Jabotinsky&#x27;s ideas were finally reborn in the two largest Jewish communities of the country. Today, each maoz counts with more than 50 betarím, including &quot;madrichim&quot; and &quot;chanichim&quot;.

===Uruguay===
One of the largest youth movements in Uruguay, Betar Uruguay has expanded greatly. Its &quot;maoz&quot; is located in Montevideo and there are weekly activities carried out as well as Jewish summer camps (Machanot) and Continental Seminars.

===Italy===
Recently created, the new maoz in Rome was founded by an Italian teen group, together with betarím from all over the world.

===Tunisia===
The group was active in Tunisia and published several periodicals, including &quot;Cahiers du Bétar&quot;.

==Sports==
There are a number of Betar (or &quot;Beitar&quot;) sports teams. Included among them are Beitar Jerusalem F.C., Beitar Tel Aviv, and Beitar Jerusalem B.C., and Beitar Ramat Gan F.C.

<text>Marsha Singh (11 October 1954 – 17 July 2012) was a British Labour Party politician, and the member of parliament (MP) for Bradford West from 1997 to 2012. Singh stood down due to ill health.

Singh had a degree in Languages, Politics and Economics of Modern Europe from Loughborough University. He was part of the Directorate of Education for Bradford City Council from 1983 to 1990 and worked for the Bradford Community Health Trust from 1990 to 1997. Singh originally lived in the Manningham Ward of the area, and later moved to Allerton.

At the 2010 general election, Singh managed to increase his majority by 5% with nearly 6,000 votes more than the second placed Zahid Iqbal, despite the Bradford West constituency being a Tory target. Singh managed a 14% majority over the Conservatives, even larger than that he had achieved when first elected in Labour&#x27;s 1997 landslide election victory.

On 29 February 2012, he announced his intention to retire owing to ill health. He officially vacated his seat by becoming Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds on 2 March 2012. A by-election in the constituency was held on 29 March 2012 and the seat was a gain for George Galloway of the Respect Party, who benefitted from a huge swing against the Labour Party.

Singh was married with two children and four grandchildren. He died four months after resigning, while on holiday in the Dominican Republic.

She became Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, in 2007 and served until her appointment as Minister of State for the Third Sector in 2009. 

Smith lost her seat to the Conservatives at the 2010 general election, contesting the reformed South Basildon and East Thurrock constituency. She was appointed to the House of Lords shortly after her defeat, where she became Shadow Deputy Chief Whip in 2012 and Shadow Leader in 2015.

==Early life==
Smith was born on 7 January 1959 in London, England. She attended Pitsea Junior School and Chalvedon Comprehensive (&quot;later&quot; Chalvedon School) in Basildon, before studying Public Administration at Leicester Polytechnic, where she graduated with a BA degree. In 1978, she married Nigel Smith, who has written a number of history books for Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4.

From 1982 to 1983, Smith was a trainee accountant with the London Borough of Newham. She then worked for the League Against Cruel Sports from 1983 to 1995, becoming the head of Political and Public Relations. She was a political researcher from 1995 to 1997.

Smith was a member of Essex County Council from 1989 and a member of the Fire Authority for the County of Essex.

==Parliamentary career==

=== House of Commons ===
Having previously contested Southend West in the 1987 general election, Smith was selected to stand for election for Labour in Basildon nearly a decade later in December 1995 through an all-women shortlist. She was elected for Basildon at the 1997 general election, replacing the Conservative MP David Amess, who had moved to contest the nearby safer seat of Southend West, which Smith previously fought herself, when Basildon&#x27;s boundaries were slightly redrawn. Amess&#x27;s hold on the seat had always been tenuous even in Tory landslides, and he knew the new boundaries all but assured his small majority would be overturned by Labour. She was re-elected comfortably in 2001 and 2005.

In December 1997, Smith introduced the Private member&#x27;s bill to minimise waste generation, and was successful in negotiating its passage through Parliament to become the Waste Minimisation Act 1998.

=== In government ===
Smith was appointed a Government Whip in 2001, before being promoted to Parliamentary under-secretary of state for Northern Ireland in October 2002. In 2006, she was moved to the Department for Communities and Local Government, with responsibility for Fire Services.

On 28 June 2007, Smith was appointed as a Parliamentary private secretary to the new prime minister Gordon Brown, entitling her to attend Cabinet. She gave up this role at the reshuffle of June 2009, to enter Government in the Cabinet Office as Minister of State for the Third Sector, when she was sworn of the Privy Council.

The old Basildon seat was abolished in the 2010 general election, and she stood for and lost the contest to the new South Basildon and East Thurrock constituency, which predominantly covered much of the area she represented in Parliament, to the Conservative candidate Stephen Metcalfe. Adverse boundary changes contributed to her defeat, as some of her voters were moved into the new Basildon and Billericay seat, whilst the new South Basildon seat took in strong Conservative wards in East Thurrock. Labour would have possibly held the old Basildon seat, and Smith herself said in a 2011 House of Lords debate: &quot;Prior to my election to the other place in 1997, the constituency boundaries in my constituency were redrawn. For the 2010 election, the constituency boundaries were redrawn again, which may explain why I am in your Lordships&#x27; House and not in the other place&quot;.

Expenses

In June 2009 Smith had to repay over £1,000 for wrongly claimed Council Tax expenses and service charges for her second property in Elephant and Castle. A review by Sir Thomas Legg uncovered further monies over-claimed by Baroness Smith making a total of £1,429 which she later returned.

=== House of Lords ===

Smith was created a Life Peer as Baroness Smith of Basildon, of Basildon in the County of Essex, on 7 July 2010, following the 2010 Dissolution Honours List. She was introduced into the House of Lords the next day.

In the Lords, Smith was Labour Spokeswoman for Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2013, Northern Ireland from 2011 to 2012 and the Home Office from 2012 to 2015. She also served as Opposition Deputy Whip in the House of Lords from 2012 to 2015. On 27 May 2015, Smith was elected unopposed as Labour&#x27;s Leader in the Lords, and so joined Harriet Harman&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet.

In June 2016, Smith and Lords chief whip Lord Bassam of Brighton stated they would boycott shadow cabinet meetings while Jeremy Corbyn remained leader of the Labour Party, but returned to attending shadow cabinet four months later.

In September 2017, she was named at Number 71 in &#x27;The 100 Most Influential People on the Left&#x27; by commentator Iain Dale.

=== Shadow cabinet ===
In April 2020, Corbyn resigned and as the leadership election ensued which was later won by Keir Starmer, Smith remained as Shadow Leader of the House of Lords.

In September 2021, she made comments regarding Corbyn and the Labour Party&#x27;s conference in Brighton. She stressed that Corbyn should not attempt to disrupt Starmer&#x27;s efforts to reshape the party&#x27;s direction. This was in light of Corbyn&#x27;s planned participation in a parallel event linked to Momentum, which had supported his leadership.

Smith strongly advocated for reforming the House of Lords, aligning with Labour&#x27;s broader constitutional review led by former prime minister Gordon Brown. She favoured replacing the current House with an elected chamber, acknowledging the existing system as &quot;indefensible.&quot; However, she was pragmatic about the time and the complexities involved in immediate constitutional change. Smith emphasised that the initial years of a Labour government would likely focus on more immediate issues such as economic growth and addressing the cost of living crisis, rather than undertaking a complete overhaul of the Lords.

== Leader of the House of Lords (2024–present) ==

Following the Labour Party&#x27;s landslide victory in the 2024 general election, Baroness Basildon was appointed as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on 5 July.

== Political positions ==
An active supporter of animal welfare, Smith is a patron of Freedom for Animals, a charity campaigning for an end to the use of animals in circuses, zoos and the exotic pet trade.
