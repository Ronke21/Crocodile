<text>Steven Michael Burns (born October 9, 1973) is an American actor, musician and television host. He portrayed a fictional version of himself as the host of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; from 1996 until 2002, for which he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy in 2001. He has also done extensive voice-over work for advertising, including the &quot;Snickers satisfies&quot; advertising campaign.

==Early life and career==
Burns was born in Boyertown, Pennsylvania, to Joseph Burns Jr. (1938–2015) and Janet Burns (née Petaccio). He has two sisters. His father served in the U.S. Navy and later became the human resources director of Safeguard Business Systems. He attended Boyertown Area Senior High School in Berks County, graduating in 1992.

During his high school and college years, Burns played in several bands: Sudden Impact US, Nine Pound Truck, and the Ivys, the latter of which he called a &quot;Morrissey rip-off band&quot;. He studied theatre under an acting scholarship at DeSales University in Center Valley, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley, where he was discovered by an agent. He dropped out of school and moved to New York City to become a professional actor. He lived in a basement apartment near Times Square, finding his first success as a voice-over artist for ads and making appearances on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

==&quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;==
In 1994, Burns auditioned for &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, thinking it was a voice-over role for a game show. He modeled his audition performance after Christopher Walken. He had long hair and an earring. &quot;I was a bit of a skate rat,&quot; he said. Initially, the Nickelodeon executives were not supportive of Burns hosting their new show; in subsequent auditions, the show&#x27;s creators requested that he dress more conservatively. (Burns reported that the creators, in a call-back phone conversation, asked him, &quot;Could you not look like yourself tomorrow morning?&quot;) It became apparent, however, that he was the favorite with preschool test audiences. Executive producer and co-creator Traci Paige Johnson reported that of the 100 people they auditioned, Burns was &quot;the realest&quot;. As Alice Wilder, Nickelodeon&#x27;s Director of Research and Development, said: &quot;There was just something about this kid, who was fresh out of Pennsylvania, who just knew where to look in the camera to really talk to kids. He was just right.&quot;

&quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; premiered on September 8, 1996, on Nick Jr. and was an instant hit due to Burns&#x27;s performances as much as the show&#x27;s format. He became &quot;a superstar&quot; among his audience and their parents, but unknown to everyone else, and enjoyed what he called being a &quot;micro-celebrity, about as small a celebrity as you can be&quot;. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, he &quot;developed an avid following among both preteen girls and mothers. The former send torrents of e-mail; the latter scrutinize the show with an intensity that might make even Elmo, the red Muppet, blush.&quot; In 2000, &quot;People&quot; included Burns in their annual list of America&#x27;s most eligible bachelors. According to writer Diane Tracy, Burns was &quot;destined for the part&quot;. Also, according to Tracy, Burns was not the typical children&#x27;s television host: &quot;There is nothing syrupy about him—his humor is sometimes borderline offbeat, but never inappropriate for preschoolers.&quot;

The show was filmed in a studio in Tribeca, Manhattan. Burns became &quot;very involved&quot; with the production of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; from the beginning. One of the most challenging aspects of hosting the show was performing on the &quot;blue screen&quot; before the animation was added. Burns called it &quot;maddening&quot; and likened it to &quot;acting at the bottom of a swimming pool&quot;.

===Departure===

After nearly six years and nearly 100 episodes, Burns announced he was leaving &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; in January 2001 and in his final episodes, which aired as a three-part special on April 29, 2002, &quot;Steve&quot; introduced new host Donovan Patton as his younger brother, Joe.

According to Johnson, Burns never wanted to become a &quot;children&#x27;s host&quot;. He loved kids, but stated, &quot;he could not make a life-long career out of it.&quot; Burns went on by saying, &quot;I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be doing children&#x27;s television all my life, mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid&#x27;s TV show, and it was happening, fast.&quot; The day following the filming of his final episode for the show, he shaved his head – something that he wanted to do for several years, but the show&#x27;s producers would not allow. He explained in a 2016 interview that &quot;a lot of the original people on the show, like the people who created it, were all moving on to other careers. It just felt like time.&quot; In a 2022 &quot;Variety&quot; interview, Burns revealed that he suffered from clinical depression while on the show.

Burns&#x27;s departure led to the resurfacing of rumors that had circulated about him since 1998, including death from a heroin overdose, being killed in a car accident, and (similar to rumors about Paul McCartney in 1966) being replaced with a look-alike. Burns made an appearance on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; to dispel these rumors, and he and co-creator Angela Santomero appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot; to help concerned parents extinguish the fears of kids who may have heard these rumors.

Burns consulted on the casting for the revival of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, titled &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues &amp; You!&quot; and hosted by Josh Dela Cruz. He and Patton reprised their roles in the premiere episode to welcome their &quot;cousin&quot; Josh, as well as on a recurring basis for the rest of the series. Burns and Patton also made prominent appearances in the Paramount+ movie &quot;Blue&#x27;s Big City Adventure&quot; in 2022. In addition, Burns has written and directed several episodes of the revival.

Burns appeared in videos for the twenty-fifth anniversary of the premiere of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; in 2021, including a widely watched Twitter video on Nick Jr.&#x27;s Twitter account in which he – in character as the host of the show – explained reassuringly that he had never forgotten the viewers after leaving to go to college, and marveling at how much each of them had experienced since then.

==Music and film &amp; television career==

Burns worked on material for his first album, &quot;Songs for Dustmites&quot;, for two and a half years at a small studio in his home in Brooklyn before it was produced by PIAS Records in late 2002. He started work on the album after he left &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; in 2002, and it was released in 2003. He posted eleven songs on his webpage and then realizing he needed help with drums and arrangements went to Steven Drozd of the Flaming Lips for advice. Drozd assisted Burns with six tracks, Lips bassist Michael Ivins engineered the album, and longtime Lips producer Dave Fridmann produced it. One of the songs from the album, &quot;Mighty Little Man&quot;, is used as the opening theme for the CBS series &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;. Burns made several appearances on the series beginning in January 2022, playing a &quot;Star Trek&quot; enthusiast whom the title character meets.

Burns started a band, Steve Burns and the Struggle, and completed his second album, &quot;Deep Sea Recovery Efforts&quot;, which was released in 2009. Members of the Struggle include Drozd and Ryan Smith of A Million Billion.

Burns acted in the 2007 horror-comedy film &quot;Netherbeast Incorporated&quot; with Darrell Hammond and Dave Foley, playing the part of a vampire. In 2008, he played an astronaut in &quot;Christmas on Mars&quot;, a science fiction film from the Flaming Lips. In March 2012, he appeared in the YouTube comedy series &quot;The Professionals&quot;.

He appeared in DeSales University&#x27;s production of &quot;Amadeus&quot; as the title character in 2007 and also appeared in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;.

In late 2016, Burns released a children&#x27;s album with Drozd, titled &quot;Foreverywhere&quot; under the name &quot;STEVENSTEVEN&quot;. They released a video of the album&#x27;s first song, &quot;The Unicorn and Princess Rainbow&quot;.

Burns made a guest appearance on Tim Kubart&#x27;s 2018 children&#x27;s album &quot;Building Blocks&quot;.

==Personal life==
After residing in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for much of his adult life, Burns told the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 2020 that he had been living mostly near the Catskill Mountains for the past four years.

<doc id="453343" wikidata="Q2420736" url="?curid=453343" title="Battle of Chantilly">
<text>The Battle of Chantilly (or Ox Hill, the Confederate name) took place on September 1, 1862, in Fairfax County, Virginia, as the concluding battle of the Northern Virginia Campaign of the American Civil War. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s corps of the Army of Northern Virginia attempted to cut off the line of retreat of the Union Army of Virginia following the Second Battle of Bull Run but was attacked by two Union divisions. During the ensuing battle, Union division commanders Isaac Stevens and Philip Kearny were both killed, but the Union attack halted Jackson&#x27;s advance.

==Background==
Defeated in the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 30, Union Maj. Gen. John Pope ordered his Army of Virginia to retreat to Centreville. The movement began after dark, with Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell&#x27;s III Corps providing cover. The army crossed Bull Run and the last troops across, Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel&#x27;s I Corps, destroyed Stone Bridge behind them. Gen. Robert E. Lee decided not to press the advantage gained that day, largely because he knew his Army of Northern Virginia was exhausted from two weeks of nearly constant marching and nearly three days of battle, so the Union retreat went unmolested. Lee&#x27;s decision also allowed the Army of Virginia&#x27;s II Corps, under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, to consolidate with the bulk of Pope&#x27;s army, marching in from Bristoe Station, where they had been guarding the army&#x27;s trains. More importantly, Lee&#x27;s decision bought time for the Union to push to the front the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s II, V, and VI Corps, which had been brought from the Peninsula and—much to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s dismay—placed under Pope&#x27;s command.

By the morning of August 31, Pope began to lose his grasp on command of his army. The defeat at Second Bull Run seemed to have shattered his nerve and Pope was unsure what to do next; he knew Washington wanted an attack but he feared Lee might strike first and destroy his reforming force before it was ready to fight again. Calling a conference of his corps commanders—something he had been loath to do previously in the Virginia Campaign—in his Centreville headquarters, Pope agreed with their decision to retreat further into the Washington defenses. But a message from General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck directed him to attack and he ordered an advance on Lee&#x27;s forces on the Manassas field.

Lee, however, had already set in motion his own plan that would rob Pope of the initiative to attack. Lee directed Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson to march his troops around Pope&#x27;s right flank to get behind the Union position at Centreville. Leading the way and scouting for any Union blocking force was Confederate cavalry under the command of Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart. Maj. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s command would remain in place for the day to deceive Pope into believing that Lee&#x27;s entire force remained in his front, while Jackson&#x27;s command would make its flanking march north and then east to take strategically important Germantown, Virginia, where Pope&#x27;s only two routes to Washington—the Warrenton Pike (modern U.S. Route 29) and the Little River Turnpike (modern U.S. Route 50)—converged. Jackson&#x27;s men, hungry and worn, moved slowly and bivouacked for the night at Pleasant Valley, three miles northeast of Centreville. As Pope settled down for the night on August 31, he was unaware that Jackson was on the verge of turning his flank.

During the night two events occurred that forced Pope to change his mind. A staff officer arrived from the Germantown position to report that a heavy force of cavalry had shelled the intersection before retreating. Pope initially dismissed the cavalry as little more than a patrol. But when, hours later, two Union cavalrymen reported seeing a large mass of infantry marching east down the Little River Turnpike, Pope realized that his army was in danger. He countermanded actions preparing for an attack and directed the army to retreat from Centreville to Washington; he also sent out a series of infantry probes up the roads that Lee might use to reach his troops as they pulled back.

==Battle==

On the morning of September 1, Pope ordered Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner of the II Corps, Army of the Potomac, to send a brigade north to reconnoiter; the army&#x27;s cavalry was too exhausted for the mission. But at the same time, he continued his movement in the direction of Washington, sending McDowell&#x27;s corps to Germantown (on the western border of modern-day Fairfax, Virginia), where it could protect the important intersection of Warrenton Pike and Little River Turnpike that the army needed for the retreat. He also sent two brigades from Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno&#x27;s IX Corps, under the command of Brig. Gen. Isaac Stevens, to block Jackson. Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny&#x27;s division from the III Corps followed later that afternoon.

Jackson resumed his march to the south, but his troops were tired and hungry and made poor progress as the rain continued. They marched only three miles and occupied Ox Hill, southeast of Chantilly Plantation, and halted, while Jackson himself took a nap. All during the morning, Confederate cavalry skirmished with Union infantry and cavalry. At about 3 p.m., Stevens&#x27; division arrived at Ox Hill. Despite being outnumbered, Stevens chose to attack across a grassy field against Brig. Gen. Alexander Lawton&#x27;s division in the Confederate center. The Union attack was initially successful, routing the brigade of Colonel Henry Strong and driving in the flank of Captain William Brown, with Brown killed during the fighting. The Union division was driven back following a counterattack by Brig. Gen. Jubal Early&#x27;s brigade. Stevens was killed during this attack at about 5 p.m., by a shot through his temple.
A severe thunderstorm erupted about this time, resulting in limited visibility and an increased dependence on the bayonet, as the rain soaked the ammunition of the infantry and made it useless. Kearny arrived about this time with his division to find Stevens&#x27; units disorganized. Perceiving a gap in the line he deployed Brig. Gen. David B. Birney&#x27;s brigade on Stevens&#x27;s left, ordering it to attack across the field. Birney managed to maneuver close to the Confederate line but his attack stalled in hand-to-hand combat with Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill&#x27;s division. Kearny mistakenly rode into the Confederate lines during the battle and was killed. As Kearny&#x27;s other two brigades arrived on the field, Birney used the reinforcements as a rear guard as he withdrew the remainder of the Union force to the southern side of the farm fields, ending the battle.

==Aftermath==
That night, Longstreet arrived to relieve Jackson&#x27;s troops and to renew the battle in the morning. The lines were so close that some soldiers accidentally stumbled into the camps of the opposing army. The Union army withdrew to Germantown and Fairfax Court House that night, followed over the next few days by retreating to the defenses of Washington. The Confederate cavalry attempted a pursuit but failed to cause significant damage to the Union army.

The fighting was tactically inconclusive. Although Jackson&#x27;s turning movement was foiled and he was unable to block the Union retreat or destroy Pope&#x27;s army, National Park Service historians count Chantilly as a strategic Confederate victory because it neutralized any threat from Pope&#x27;s army and cleared the way for Lee to begin his Maryland Campaign. The Confederates claimed a tactical victory as well because they held the field after the battle. Two Union generals were killed, while one Confederate brigade commander was killed. Pope, recognizing the attack as an indication of continued danger to his army, continued his retreat to the fortifications around Washington, D.C. Lee began the Maryland Campaign, which culminated in the Battle of Antietam, after Pope retreated from Virginia. The Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, absorbed the forces of Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia, which was disbanded as a separate army.

==Battlefield today==

The site of the battle, once rural farmland, is now surrounded by suburban development in Fairfax County, Virginia. The modern thoroughfares of U.S. Route 50 (Lee-Jackson Memorial Highway) and State Route 286 (Fairfax County Parkway), as well as State Route 608 (West Ox Road) intersect near the location of the battle. A 4.8 acre (19,000 m2) memorial park, the Ox Hill Battlefield Park, is located off of West Ox Road and lies adjacent to the Fairfax Towne Center shopping area, and includes most of the Gen. Isaac Stevens portion of the battle, about 1.5% of the total ground. The park is under the jurisdiction of the Fairfax County Park Authority; in January 2005, the Authority approved a General Management Plan and Conceptual Development Plan that sets forth a detailed history and future management framework for the site.

A small yard located within the nearby Fairfax Towne Center has been preserved to mark the area crossed by Confederate troops to get to the Ox Hill battlefield.

<text>Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) was an American aerospace and arms manufacturer headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia. The company operated across 22 states, Puerto Rico, and internationally. ATK revenue in fiscal year 2014 was about US$4.8 billion.

On April 29, 2014, ATK announced that it would spin off its Sporting Group and merge its Aerospace and Defense Groups with Orbital Sciences Corporation.

The spinoff of the Sporting Group to create Vista Outdoor and the merger leading to the creation of Orbital ATK were completed on February 9, 2015. The companies began operations as separate entities on February 20, 2015. Orbital ATK was bought by Northrop Grumman in 2018.

==History==
ATK was launched as an independent company in 1990 after Honeywell spun off its defense businesses to shareholders. The former Honeywell businesses had supplied defense products and systems to the U.S. and its allies for 50 years, including the first electronic autopilot for the B-17 aircraft&#x27;s bombing missions during World War II.

In 1995, ATK entered the aerospace market with the acquisition of the Hercules Aerospace Co., a division of Hercules Inc. Since then ATK has become a supplier of aerospace and defense products to the U.S. government and its allies, and to their contractors. It also carries on the manufacture and sale of the Hercules gunpowder lines.

In 2001, ATK acquired Thiokol, renaming it ATK Launch Systems in 2006, though it was still known within the industry by its original name. Thiokol was the sole manufacturer of the reusable Solid Rocket Motor used to launch the NASA Space Shuttle, which is being adapted for NASA&#x27;s Space Launch System.

Also in 2001, ATK entered the sporting and law enforcement ammunition market with the acquisition of the ammunition businesses of Blount International. This acquisition made ATK the nation&#x27;s largest manufacturer of ammunition.

In 2009, ATK acquired Eagle Industries and in 2010 ATK acquired Blackhawk Industries Products Group Unlimited, LLC, diversifying into the security and law enforcement market.

On 29 April 2014, ATK announced that its board unanimously approved a plan to create two independent, public companies composed of ATK&#x27;s current businesses and Orbital Sciences Corporation. ATK spun off its Sporting Group to ATK shareholders on a tax-free basis. The spinoff was immediately followed by an all-stock merger of ATK&#x27;s Aerospace and Defense Groups with Orbital Sciences; Orbital shareholders received ATK common stock as consideration. The combined company was named Orbital ATK Inc. On October 28, 2014, ATK announced that it would be seeking approval of issuance of shares to Orbital stockholders on December 9.

ATK responded to news of the explosion of a rocket built by Orbital in an earnings call. ATK stated it would conduct a &quot;thorough evaluation of any potential implications resulting from the incident, including current operating plans, long-term strategies, and the proposed transaction&quot;. ATK also said that it was taking a careful look at its Castor 30XL motor, which is used in the second stage of Orbital&#x27;s Antares rocket. ATK further noted that the explosion occurred before ignition of the second stage.

On November 17, 2014 ATK stated that its due-diligence assessment of its merger with Orbital Sciences undertaken in response to the failure of Orbital&#x27;s Antares rocket found that the transaction remained in the best interest of its shareholders. Both firms rescheduled shareholder votes on the merger from December 9, 2014 to January 27, 2015.

The spinoff of the Sporting Group to create Vista Outdoor and the merger leading to the creation of Orbital ATK were completed on February 9, 2015; both companies began operations as separate entities on February 20, 2015. Orbital ATK was bought by Northrop Grumman in June 2018.

In July 2022, Northrop CEO Kathy Warden was forced to deny reports that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would break up the merger.

==Groups==
===ATK Aerospace===

ATK&#x27;s Aerospace Group covered space, defense and commercial aerospace products and capabilities. The group offered propulsion for space exploration, commercial launch vehicles and strategic and missile defense. ATK Aerospace was headquartered in Magna, Utah.

It also specialized in:
* Composite structures for military and commercial aircraft
*Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engine
*Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II (also known as the Joint Strike Fighter)
*Integrated satellite systems
*Satellite components and subsystems
*Military flares and decoys
*Space engineering services
*Propulsion for space exploration, commercial launch vehicles, strategic and missile defines
**ALV X-1 sounding rocket

In November 2010, ATK was selected by NASA for potential contracts in heavy lift launch vehicle systems and other propulsion technologies. In 2012, NASA awarded the company a $50 million contract to complete engineering development and risk reduction tests as part of the Advanced Concept Booster Development for the Space Launch System (SLS).

In April 2014, ATK received a contract from the United Launch Alliance, worth $178 million, to produce composite structures for the United States Air Force&#x27;s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program. ATK will deliver parts for the Atlas V and Delta IV starting in 2014 and continuing into early 2018. There is an option for additional deliveries in 2017 and 2018. ATK will provide fairings, payload adapters and diaphragms, interstages, nose cones, and thermal/aerodynamic protection components. All the structures will be produced at ATK&#x27;s Large Structures Center of Excellence in Iuka, Mississippi.

ATK produces avionics for NASA&#x27;s Space Launch System program. The Space Launch System is designed for deep space operations, including missions to Mars. After ATK finishes testing, avionics will be delivered to NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center. The first launch is expected in 2017.

====Airbus A350 XWB-1000====

ATK produces composite stringers and frames for the Airbus A350 XWB-1000 variant at its facility in Clearfield, Utah. As of 2014, ATK has delivered more than 10,000 components to Airbus.

====Boeing 787 Dreamliner====

ATK participated in a consortium to develop a new engine nozzle for the Boeing 787 designed to make its operation more environmentally friendly. The nozzle was made from oxide-oxide ceramic matrix composite (CMC) and tested on the 787 ecoDemonstrator. Boeing&#x27;s tests show that the nozzle is more heat resistant than previous models and lighter, allowing for potential gains in fuel efficiency. This was the largest part ever made from CMC.

====Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle====

The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle is a spacecraft intended to carry a crew of up to four astronauts to destinations beyond-low Earth orbit. Currently under development by NASA, for launch on the Space Launch System, Orion will facilitate human exploration of the Moon, asteroids and Mars.

ATK developed the launch abort motor that sits on top of the Orion capsule. This device would pull the capsule and its crew up and away from the rocket in the event of major fault on the launch pad or during ascent. ATK also developed numerous composite parts that provide heat protection for Orion.

====James Webb Space Telescope====
ATK worked with Northrop Grumman to produce the backplane support frame (BSF) for the James Webb Space Telescope. The BSF, center section, and wings form what is called the primary mirror backplane support system (PMBSS). The BSF is the primary load-bearing structure during launch and the PMBSS holds the telescope&#x27;s main instruments, including its mirrors. The BSF was designed and manufactured at ATK&#x27;s facilities in Magna, Utah. ATK designed and fabricated more than 10,000 parts for the PMBSS. PMBSS is made primarily of lightweight graphite, but numerous other materials including invar, titanium, and other composite materials were used.

====Delta II====
ATK produces Graphite Epoxy Motors (GEM) and largest composite fairings for the Delta II rocket as a subcontractor for the United Launch Alliance. As of June 2014, ATK has produced 987 solid rocket boosters for Delta II missions. These strap-on boosters, known as GEM-40s, add 434,000 pounds to the Delta II&#x27;s maximum thrust. The GEM-40s can be used in groups of three, four, and nine depending on the weight of the payload. The composite structures supplied by ATK increase performance by reducing weight. In addition to composite booster cases for the GEM-40s, ATK produces a 10-foot wide composite payload fairing that covers and protects satellites during launch. ATK also produces the titanium diaphragm propellant tanks and pressurant tank for each Delta II vehicle.

====Delta IV====

ATK produces Graphite Epoxy Motors and numerous other components for the Delta IV rocket. For example, for the Delta IV that carried the Wideband Global SATCOM satellite (WGS-6) into orbit for the U.S. Air Force, ATK supplied the interstage connector that linked the Common Booster Core and the cryogenic second stage, a centerbody that connects the liquid oxygen tank to liquid hydrogen tanks, a thermal shield for the RS-68 engine, the composite payload fairing, and numerous pieces of hardware for securing the payload.

====Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2====

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) is an American environmental science satellite. The spacecraft is used to study carbon dioxide concentrations and distributions in the atmosphere. ATK produced the OCO-2&#x27;s Variable Conductance Heat Pipes, an important part of its thermal control system, solar arrays, and solar array substrates.

====InSight====
InSight is a robotic lander mission to Mars originally planned for launch in March 2016. The mission&#x27;s objective is to place a stationary lander equipped with a seismometer and heat flow probe on the surface of Mars to study its early geological evolution. This would bring new understanding of the solar system&#x27;s terrestrial planets. ATK was awarded a contract to provide its UltraFlex solar arrays for the mission. ATK claims that UltraFlex will provide better performance than typical solar arrays used on spacecraft while accommodating ambitious requirements for low mass and small size.

====Atlas V====

ATK entered the competition to replace the Russian-made rocket engine on the Atlas V rocket in September 2014. The Atlas V is used to launch most U.S. military satellites. ATK entered the competition in response to a request for proposals from the Air Force Space and Missile Defense Center issued in 2013 for the RD-180 rocket engine. ATK already supplies rocket engines used in heavier version of the Atlas V. ATK says that solid rocket motors are more reliable and deliver more thrust. ATK said, &quot;Solid rocket motors are optimal for first-stage performance as they provide high lift-off thrust, allowing for more payload margin. They also require less ground and launch infrastructure, resulting in fewer launch scrubs.&quot; The RD-180 engines use kerosene for fuel. The request from the Air Force occurred due to concerns about whether the RD-180 would be available in the future due to increasing tensions with Russia.

====Graphite Epoxy Motors====
The Graphite-Epoxy Motor (GEM) is a solid rocket motor produced by ATK using epoxy composite casing. GEMs are used as boosters for the Delta II, Delta III, and Delta IV launch vehicles. The use of composite materials allows for booster casings several times lighter than the steel casings of the Castor 4 solid rocket motors they replaced. The first flight of a GEM occurred in 1990 on a Delta II 7925.

===ATK Defense===

ATK&#x27;s Defense Group produced ammunition, precision and strike weapons, missile-warning solutions and tactical rocket motors across air, sea and land-based systems.

ATK Defense Group develops products and services for:
*Small-, medium- and large-caliber ammunition
*Anti-radiation homing strike vehicles
**AARGM
*Missile warning and hostile fire detection
*Precision-guided munitions
**PGK
**XM25
*Propulsion, advanced fuzing and warheads
*Medium-caliber gun systems
*Missile defense interceptors
*Weaponized ISR special mission aircraft
**MC-27J

As of April 2014, ATK had a three-year contract with Lockheed to develop a warhead for the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. The contract includes engineering, manufacturing, and development. ATK&#x27;s work will focus on system performance, warhead qualification, and producibility.

====Lake City Army Ammunition Plant====
In 2012, ATK was selected by the United States Army to continue operating and maintaining the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP) for an additional seven to ten years. The LCAAP is a federally owned facility in Independence, Missouri. It was built by Remington Arms in 1941 to manufacture and test small-caliber ammunition for the army. As of July 2007, the plant produced about 1.5 billion rounds of ammunition per year. The LCAAP still tests ammunition and is the largest producer of small-arms ammunition for the U.S. military. ATK has operated the LCAAP since April 2001.

The United States Army and ATK opened a renovated ammunition production facility at the LCAAP in December 2014. The renovations improved efficiency and quality control. The Army and ATK invested $11 million to modernize &quot;Building 65&quot; for the production of 20 millimeter ammunition. These large caliber rounds are usually fired from automatic cannons mounted on ground vehicles and aircraft. Building 65 housed 20 millimeter round production until 1997, when it was moved to Building 3. About 50 people are employed on this line.

====AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile====

The AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) is an upgrade to the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM). The AARGM is the result of cooperation between the United States and Italy. It is produced by ATK. In September 2013, ATK delivered the 100th AARGM to the U.S. Navy. It will be initially integrated onto the FA-18C/D, FA-18E/F, EA-18G, and Tornado ECR aircraft and later on the F-35. The AGM-88E development program was proceeded on schedule and did not exceed its budget.

In August 2014, the United States Navy awarded a full-rate production contract to ATK to produce to AARGM. Under this contract ATK will also provide captive air training missiles for both the United States and Italy. This is the third contract for the AARGM won by ATK and it is worth $96.2 million.

====AN/AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning System====
The AN/AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning System (MWS) is used on slow moving aircraft such as helicopters and military transport aircraft to notify the pilot of threats and to trigger the aircraft&#x27;s countermeasures systems. Its main users are the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force, but is also operated by other countries. Originally developed by Loral Space &amp; Communications, it has been solely a product of ATK since 2002. The AN/AAR-47 passively detects missiles by their infrared signature, and uses algorithms to differentiate between incoming missiles and false alarms. Newer versions also have laser warning sensors and are capable of detecting a wider range of threats. After processing the nature of the threat, the system gives the pilot an audio and visual warning, and tells the direction of the incoming threat. It also sends a signal to the aircraft&#x27;s infrared countermeasures system, which can then for example deploy flares. The development of the original AN/AAR-47(V)1 began in 1983 by Loral. ATK became a second production source in the mid 90s and eventually became the primary contractor. In 1998 ATK began production of the improved AN/AAR-47(V)2, which added laser warning functionality.

====Precision Guidance Kit====

The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a United States Army program to develop a precision guidance system for existing 155 mm artillery shells. The prime contractor is Alliant Techsystems and the project team includes Interstate Electronics Corporation. In operation the PGK will screw into the nose of the projectile much like the existing fuze. However, as well as the fuzing function it will provide a GPS guidance package and control surfaces to correct the flight of the shell. This is analogous to the addition of a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail-kit to a dumb iron bomb, creating a precision guided munition. Production started in 2009.

====Bushmaster autocannons====

The M242 Bushmaster is a 25 mm (25×137mm) chain-fed autocannon. It is used extensively by the United States and NATO forces in ground combat vehicles and watercraft. Originally, the weapon was designed and manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. It is an externally powered, chain driven, single-barrel weapon which may be fired in semi-automatic, burst, or automatic modes. It is fed by a metallic link belt and has dual-feed capability. The term &quot;chain gun&quot; derives from the use of a roller chain that drives the bolt back and forth. The gun can destroy lightly armored vehicles and aerial targets, such as helicopters and slow-flying aircraft. It can also suppress enemy positions such as exposed troops, dug-in positions, and occupied built-up areas. The standard rate of fire is 200 rounds per minute. The weapon has an effective range of , depending on the type of ammunition used.

The Mk44 Bushmaster II is a 30 mm chain gun also manufactured by ATK. It is a derivative of the 25 mm M242 referenced above and uses 70% of the same parts as the M242. The Mk 44 Bushmaster II is the standard primary armament of the Bionix-II AFV currently in service with the Singapore Army, the KTO Rosomak in Polish service as well as that of the CV90 AFVs in Finnish, Norwegian and Swiss service. Some United States Navy vessels, such as the new &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class amphibious transport dock are armed with the Bushmaster II for surface threat defense.

The XM813 Bushmaster, also produced by ATK Defense, is based on the Mk44 and is offered as an upgrade for M1126 Stryker and M2 Bradley. Improvements include a one-inch longer barrel, integral mount to increase first round hit probability by up to 10 percent, and dual recoil system to enhance accuracy and cope with future hotter propellants. It can have a next-round select, linkless feed system. The 30 mm chain gun can fire Mk310 Programmable Air Burst Munition rounds to attack targets in defilade. The United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command helped enhance the XM813 mainly for safety and turret integration. By changing five parts, the gun caliber can be increased to 40 mm. As of November 2013, the XM813 was being tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground.

<text>Glengettie is a blend of tea aimed at Welsh consumers. It was first marketed in 1952.

==History ==
Glengettie is supplied in bags and also loose, in brown cartons, with English and Welsh text on opposite sides. The brand&#x27;s website describes the tea as &quot;an everyday black tea blend made up of Kenyan and Assam teas. The Kenyan teas give distinct flavour and rich colour, and the Assam teas give the blend a good, brisk strength&quot; and claims that it &quot;has been specially designed to complement the region’s soft water&quot;.

In November 2016 the brand launched a series of radio adverts featuring actor Di Botcher who plays Aunty Brenda in the television comedy drama &quot;Stella&quot;, which is set in South Wales. The Glengettie brand is owned by Typhoo Tea Limited, which until 2021 was part of by the Apeejay Surrendra Group, an Indian conglomerate.

In 2021 Glengettie&#x27;s parent company Typhoo was acquired by British private-equity firm Zetland Capital. In March 2023 Typhoo announced it was closing its Moreton factory on the Wirral and outsourcing production of all its tea brands including Glengettie.

<text> (; plural ) is a traditional Welsh short poem form. It uses quantitative metres, involving the counting of syllables, and rigid patterns of rhyme and half rhyme. Each line contains a repeating pattern of consonants and accent known as .

==Early history==

The is found in the work of the earliest attested Welsh poets (the ), where the main types are the three-line and . It is the only set stanzaic metre found in the early Welsh poetic corpus, and explanations for its origins have tended to focus on stanzaic Latin poetry and hymns; however, it is as likely to be a development within the Brittonic poetic tradition. Whereas the metrical rules of later are clear (and are based on counting syllables), the precise metre of the early is debated and could have involved stress-counting. The earliest are found as marginalia written in a tenth-century hand in the Juvencus Manuscript. Many early form poems which seem to represent moments of characters&#x27; emotional reflection in stories now lost: , , . Others survey heroic tradition, for example the or &quot;Geraint son of Erbin&quot;, and others again are lyric, religious meditations and laments such as the famous and .

== Types of ==

There are a number of types of . Details of their structures are as follows; not all of these, however, are included in the Traditional Welsh poetic metres.

Also known as &quot;the short-ended &quot;. It consists of a stanza of three lines. The first line has ten syllables (in two groups of five), the second has five to six; and the third has seven. The seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the first line introduces the rhyme and this is repeated on the last syllable of the other two lines. The fourth syllable of the second line may echo the final syllable of the first through either rhyme or consonance.
=== ===
The &quot;straight one-rhymed &quot;, identical to except that it adds a fourth, rhyming, seven-syllable line at the end. Thus it consists of four lines of ten, six, seven and seven syllables. The seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the first line introduces the rhyme and this is repeated on the last syllable of the other three lines. The part of the first line after the rhyme alliterates with the first part of the second line.

This is an by Alan Llwyd:


The &quot;soldier&#x27;s &quot;. This consists of three seven-syllable lines. All three lines rhyme.
=== ===
The &quot;even &quot;, more common in the Middle Ages than later. This consists of four seven-syllable lines. All four lines rhyme. One example (showing the half-rhyme of with ) is:
=== ===
The &quot;short crooked &quot;. This is like , but orders the lines differently: seven syllables in the first, ten syllables (in two groups of five) in the second, and five to six syllables in the third. In the following example, the second line does not participate in the rhyme:
=== ===

The &quot;crooked one-rhyme &quot;. This is like , except that it adds an extra seven-syllable line at the beginning. This is made up of four lines of seven, seven, ten and six syllables. The last syllables of the first, second and last lines and the seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the third line all rhyme.

The &quot;seeking &quot;. This form has four lines of seven syllables each. The final syllables of the first, second, and last line rhyme. The final syllable of the third line rhymes with the second, third or fourth syllable of the last line:
=== ===

In this , there are four seven-syllable lines that half-rhyme with each other (half-rhyme means that the final consonants agree).
=== ===

This is identical to the except that the half rhymes must use the , , , and diphthongs.

The &quot;chain half-rhyme &quot;. In this version there are four lines of seven syllables. The first and third lines rhyme and the second and fourth half rhyme on the same vowel sound as the full rhyme syllables.

The &quot;reciprocal half-rhyme &quot;. This has four lines of seven syllables. All four lines half-rhyme, and there is additional .
This is a hybrid between an and a . The first two lines are as for an , and there follow two more lines of ten syllables each.
After the first two lines there is just one more line of three syllables or fewer, which follows the rhyme of the first two lines.

<doc id="453375" wikidata="Q697655" url="?curid=453375" title="Stielhandgranate">
<text> is the German term for &quot;stick hand grenade&quot; and generally refers to a prominent series of World War I and World War II–era German stick grenade designs, distinguished by their long wooden handles, pull cord arming and cylindrical warheads. The first models were introduced by the Imperial German Army during World War I and the final design was introduced during World War II by the German Wehrmacht.

The distinctive appearance of the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; family has led to them being called &quot;potato mashers&quot; in British Army slang, and they remain one of the most easily recognized infantry weapons of the 20th century.

== World War I models: 1915–1917 ==

Germany entered World War I with a single grenade type: a heavy ball-shaped fragmentation grenade (&quot;Kugelhandgranate&quot;) for use only by pioneers in attacking fortifications. It was too heavy for regular battlefield use by untrained troops and not suitable for mass production. This left Germany without a standard-issue grenade and improvised designs similar to those of the British were used until a proper grenade could be supplied.

Germany introduced the &quot;stick grenade&quot; in 1915, the second year of the conflict. Aside from its unusual appearance, the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; used a friction igniter system. This had been used in other German grenades, but was uncommon internationally.

During World War I, the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot;, under the name M1915 (Model 1915), competed technologically with the British standard-issue Mills bomb series. The first Mills bomb – the grenade  5 Mk. 1 – was introduced the same year as the German Model 1915, but due to manufacturing delays it was not widely distributed into general service until 1916. Thus, there was a small period of time where German troops had large supplies of new Model 1915 grenades, while their British opponents only had a small number.

As World War I progressed, the Model 1915 &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; was improved with various changes. These variants received designations such as the Model 1916 and the Model 1917.

=== Model 1915 (M15): &quot;Stielhandgranate 15&quot; ===

In 1915, industries of the German Empire designed and began production of the original &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot;, the &quot;Model 1915&quot; (M15). It used a priming system, unlike the percussion cap pin used in most grenades of the period. The easily recognizable &quot;potato masher&quot; shape is a result of a number of different styles and choices of the design. The grenade mounted a charge head within a sheet-steel cylinder atop a long hollow wooden handle. Internally, the explosive – initially ammonal but later approximately of trinitrotoluene filling – was connected to a detonator, and a pull cord ran from the detonator down the length of the hollow handle, emerging from the base. To use it, a soldier would pull the string downwards, dragging a rough steel rod through the igniter within the fuse. The rod&#x27;s abrasive contact would cause sparks and a flame to light, setting the fuse burning. This fuse took approximately four and a half seconds to reach the detonator before exploding.

The British War Office reported average thrown distance of a Mills bomb as when standing, when crouched and lying prone. One issue that hand grenades of the time had was unpredictable rolling after landing. The &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; did not suffer nearly as much. Instead of rolling straight down a hill or across rough terrain, it would instead roll from side to side. However, the larger size and the irregular overall shape meant that fewer grenades could be carried. It also took longer to prime the grenade than Allied counterparts such as the Mills bomb.

The &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; primarily relied on a concussion blast effect, its thin metal container creating little fragmentation compared with many grenades of the time, such as the Mills bomb and the French F1 grenade, the later World War II American Mk 2 grenade, and the Russian (later Soviet) F1 grenade. Fragmentation grenades produced shrapnel which could wound enemy infantry over a large area, which made these types very useful in open areas such as fields, the blasted expanse of no man&#x27;s land, beaches, spacious trenches, and wide city streets.

Concussion grenades were primarily designed to stun opponents at close quarters with the blast of their explosive charge, thereby reducing resistance for the immediately following-up infantry assault closing with its target with rifles and bayonets. The &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; was extremely effective and reliable in clearing enclosed areas, such as buildings, fortifications, and the fighting compartments of enemy tanks, although performance in wide open areas was less satisfactory. The blast effect went only a limited distance before dying out, while pieces from an equivalent fragmentation grenade could fly hundreds of metres (it was not unrealistic to expect that metal shrapnel could create friendly fire casualties, especially in open areas).

=== Model 1916 (M16): &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 16 ===
The pull cord which activated the M15 grenade&#x27;s fuse protruded from the base and could get caught in debris or clutter on the battlefields of World War I, causing the fuse to be ignited, and the grenade to explode on the belt of an unaware infantryman. This resulted in the introduction of the Model 1916 (M16).

Functionally identical to the M15, the M16 changed the pull cord to improve safety. A small porcelain ball was placed at the base of the grenade, attached directly to the pull cord. This prevented the string from being exposed. The small bead was partially enveloped in the wooden handle, meaning that some force was needed to pluck it out. Operation was nearly identical, except that a soldier no longer needed to pull the string itself.

=== Model 1917 (M17): &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 17 ===
Another development of the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; was implemented during the later stages of World War I, affecting the priming system. The base of the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot;″s handle was slightly redesigned, and a metal cover cap was introduced. This cap concealed the porcelain bead and pull cord, allowing it to simply rest freely inside of the handle. The operator pulled the cap off and then pulled the cord as with the M16.


== Model 1924 (M24): &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 ==
With the German Empire&#x27;s defeat at the conclusion of World War I, the collapse of industrial capability and military strength of Germany left many projects and ideas forgotten for years. When the newly created Weimar Republic progressively began to repair both the physical and economic devastation, a slow rebuilding of the armed forces was allowed under the limitations set by the allies.

The Weimar Republic revived the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot;, and created a new version in 1924, the &quot;Model 1924&quot; (M24). While retaining the same explosive and fuse, the main distinction between the M24 and the original M15 is a slightly shorter charge head and the removal of a belt carry clip. At the same time the wooden handle was lengthened. The intent of these design alterations was simply for mobility; German soldiers could easily (and often did) tuck the grenade in behind their uniform&#x27;s belt, held tight and secure. Being slightly lighter, and smaller in thickness, this improved overall use.

The M24 (75.5 million produced) was beside the more common Model 39 grenade (84.2 million produced) the standard hand grenade of the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during World War II. Adapting to the rapidly changing field of modern warfare, German soldiers would carry the M24 directly in front, allowing quick and easy access. However, in the later years of the war it was often advised to carry them in a different manner, as it was very likely any sort of explosion or heat could light the fuse from the grenade on the belt, resulting in unnecessary casualties.

The Model 24 &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; was stored in specially designed crates during transport, which could carry up to 15 individual grenades. As a safety precaution, units of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; were advised to only insert the actual fuse assemblies when about to go into combat. Later in the war, however, many soldiers of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; would always have their weapons ready, due to the fierceness seen in the Soviet Red Army in the east and the progressive advance of the Allies on the Western Front. A reminder was stenciled on each explosive charge: &quot;Vor Gebrauch Sprengkapsel einsetzen&quot; (&quot;Before use insert detonator&quot;).

=== Variants of the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 ===
The Model 1924 was rather ineffective by itself at damaging or disabling an enemy armored vehicle or destroying fortifications. It also lacked the shrapnel effect of most other grenades of the time. To overcome these faults, various German industries during World War II produced a number of variants that widened the utility and capability of the M24.

==== Winter variant (K variant): &quot;Stielhandgranate 24 Kalt&quot; ====
During numerous operations of the invasion of the Soviet Union, the &quot;Heer&quot; found that under freezing conditions the M24&#x27;s fuse could fail to ignite. In response, a variant with a cold-resistant explosive was developed and supplied to most units deployed on the eastern front (especially into present-day Russia). During production, the metal charge head was marked with a letter &quot;K&quot;, for the German word &quot;Kalt&quot; (English: cold).

==== Smoke variant: &quot;Nebelhandgranate&quot; 39 ====

The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; lacked a proper smoke grenade to allow infantry to cover advances or retreats, or for assaulting a position. A smoke version of the M24, the &quot;Nebelhandgranate&quot; 39 (English: Fog hand grenade 39), was produced. It had a remodeled fuse mechanism and a smoke charge instead of explosive; the smoke emitted from small vents in the underside of the charge head. To make it readily distinguishable from an M4, it had large markings on the head and a white band on the handle. Later, the handle was textured so that they could be told apart by touch.

==== Exercise variant: &quot;Übungs-Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 ====
Like most of the forces that took part in World War II, the Wehrmacht produced inert (not able to explode) practice versions of the standard-issue grenade, designed to aid recruits on how to properly throw and operate the weapon during training. An exercise version called &quot;Übungs-Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 (English: Exercise-stick hand grenade 24) was introduced that was characterized by its bright-red warhead with big perforated holes going throughout. The &quot;Übungs-Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 could be outfitted with an exercise charge and a fuse with a pull cord that made a bang and puff of smoke to indicate explosion when used.

=== Alternative use of the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 ===
==== Improvised &quot;bundle charge&quot;: &quot;Geballte Ladung&quot; ====
The M24 lacked effectiveness against hard targets such as tanks and buildings. A common solution was an improvised &quot;bundle charge&quot;, officially known as &quot;Geballte Ladung&quot; (English: &quot;concentrated charge&quot;). The heads of a number of M24 grenades – their handles and fuses removed – would be strapped around a complete grenade, usually with simple rope, cloth, or metal wire, a solution initially invented during World War I using M15, M16 and M17 grenades. These &quot;bundle charges&quot; could be crafted with up to six additional heads around the complete grenade, the most common styles being the addition of four or six M24 heads.

As a result of this cost-effective and reliable solution, the standard infantryman of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; could quickly improvise a grenade with up to seven times the explosive power. However, the added weight made it more difficult to throw, and the increased size meant that it was not practical to carry with one hand and that far fewer could be carried. These factors meant that infantry squads, if faced with an armored enemy, would have to close to a reduced range if they wanted to use the bundle charges. During the early years of World War II, there was little in terms of truly effective German handheld weaponry designed to fight hard targets such as armored vehicles and structures, and even later in the war this style of bundle grenade remained useful to the common &quot;Heer&quot; infantryman.

==== Improvised &quot;bangalore torpedo&quot;: &quot;Gestreckte Ladung&quot; ====
A different version of improvised weapon using M24 grenades was the &quot;Gestreckte Ladung&quot; (English: Elongated Charge), a type of bangalore torpedo made out of a number of M24 grenades – their handles and fuses removed and replaced with detonators – mounted to a long stick or plank behind one another with a complete grenade at one end to initiate the explosion.

=== Foreign use and designs of &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 ===
Separate from Nazi Germany, the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 was used globally during World War II. A number of nations either directly acquired or purchased stockpiles of the grenade, or created similar versions with very slight adjustments.
==== Spain (Spanish version M24, &quot;grenade ferrobellum&quot;)====
==== China (M24 clones, Type 67) ====

China started using the M24 &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; as a result of the German involvement in the modernization of the Chinese Army during the Sino-German cooperation 1926–1941. During this period the Chinese army would adopt German uniforms and equipment, such as the &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 24.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), the Chinese designed and produced a grenade based on the Model 1924 which was used by the National Revolutionary Army. Such grenades were the main type of grenade used by Chinese forces during the whole war. The M24 inspired clone was a simple design and was mass-produced in large numbers, not only in arsenals (primarily in the 1st, 11th, 21st, 24th, 25th and 30th), but also by hand with the help of civilians. Hundreds of thousands of grenades were produced each month. There were some variations in the design, but most followed the same basic pattern: A wooden handle with a round or cylindrical warhead and a slow burning fuse. The charge was a mixture of TNT and potassium nitrate, and they were generally somewhat weaker than their German counterpart. In 1939, a new design with a smaller handle and much more compressed explosive load began trials. The resulting model was lighter and more powerful and the ordnance office decreed it to be the new standard type in all arsenals.

Just like German troops, Chinese soldiers often bundled grenades together to blast open fortifications, vehicles and the like. Another tactic was to tie a grenade to a long bamboo stick, for example to stick up over a wall or into a window.

After World War II, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army standardized a variant of the grenade, designated &quot;Type 67&quot;. It became the standard grenade for the PLA and was also supplied in huge numbers to the Viet Cong and the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

==== Japan (Type 98) ====

In 1938, the Imperial Japanese Army copied the Chinese &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot; 24 and produced them at a Japanese factory in Manchuria (then Japanese Manchukuo). These were designated the &quot;Type 98&quot;. Unlike both the original German M24 and its Chinese counterpart, the Type 98 was a fragmentation grenade. The charge, however, was weak and only contained of picric acid (more powerful but less safe than TNT). The weapon had a pull ring attached to the igniting cord, and the fuse delay was 4 to 5 seconds (varying from grenade to grenade). Like the Chinese grenades, it was a crude copy of the Model 1924 and a number of issues plagued its effectiveness.

==== Sweden (&quot;Shgr m/39&quot;) ====
To catch up in the arms race leading to WWII, Sweden managed to purchase a large amount of German produced M24s in 1939, adopting it as the &quot;spränghandgranat m/39&quot; (abbr. &quot;shgr m/39&quot;), meaning: &quot;explosive hand grenade m/39&quot;. Later shipments included wartime changes to the grenades, such as a metal pull cord and cheaper explosives such as nitrolite, leading to four designs in use eventually: &quot;m/39&quot;, &quot;m/39A&quot;, &quot;m/39B&quot; and &quot;m/39C&quot;. These would remain in use until expended during the Cold War.

Along the M24s, the exercise &quot;Übungs-Stielhandgranate 24&quot; variant was also purchased, being adopted as the &quot;övningshandgranat m/39&quot; (abbr. &quot;övnhgr m/39&quot;), meaning: &quot;practice hand grenade m/39&quot;. They were painted according to Swedish color code with a blue stripe to indicate exercise charge. German ones were painted red. Later on the övnhgr m/39s were modified to use more modern exercise charges, receiving suffix letters per upgrade, eventually resulting in the &quot;övnhgr m/39C&quot;.

Sweden also produced an indigenous design similar to the M24, featuring a pull cord through the handle for arming the time-fuze, but also differing in a great number of areas, such as having a full metal tube for the handle, a more rounded warhead, and other quality of life additions to the overall design. It was designated &quot;spränghandgranat m/43&quot;.


== Model 1943 (M43): &quot;Stielhandgranate 43&quot; and &quot;Eihandgranate 43&quot; ==
As the war progressed and the Wehrmacht began to lose strength and momentum against the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany began implementing measures to ensure the safety and reliability of its weapons. The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; needed to minimize the risk of injury or death caused by faults of its military equipment, munitions, and weapons.

Germany&#x27;s industrial capabilities decreased as the war progressed. As a result, the production of munitions, equipment, and weaponry had to become easier and more cost-efficient. Some of these, like the &quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; 42, were more than a success on the level of resources, but many were only simpler and less-expensive versions of an existing item. The Model 1924 grenade was technically &quot;succeeded&quot; by the Model 1943 (M43). This was a copy with a few expensive parts removed or replaced for easier production – and because of this, the original remained in service with &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; infantry right to the end of the war.

The only significant alterations in the M43&#x27;s design was the inclusion of a self-contained detonator, meaning that the fuse and the explosive were directly linked. The M43 also utilized an entirely different fuse assembly, very similar to that of the Model 39 grenade, another German hand grenade of the time. Not only was the stick no longer needed to be hollowed out for a pull cord as in the M24, minimizing the amount of woodworking required to manufacture each grenade, it also made the stick optional so it could replace the Model 39 as the thrower could choose in which configuration to use the grenade. Whether it was intended to merge the production of two types into a single line, or if that was a beneficial side-effect is unknown.

<text>The Pool of London is a stretch of the River Thames from London Bridge to below Limehouse.

Part of the Tideway of the Thames, the Pool was navigable by tall-masted vessels bringing coastal and later overseas goods—the wharves there were the original part of the Port of London. The Pool of London is divided into two parts, the Upper Pool and Lower Pool. The Upper Pool consists of the section between London Bridge, which blocked tall-masts from continuing west, and the Cherry Garden Pier in Bermondsey. The Lower Pool runs from the Cherry Garden Pier to Limekiln Creek.

==History==
Originally, the Pool of London was the stretch of the River Thames along Billingsgate on the south side of the City of London where all imported cargoes had to be delivered for inspection and assessment by Customs Officers, giving the area the name of &quot;Legal Quays&quot;. Smuggling, theft and pilferage of cargoes were rife, both on the busy open wharves and in the crowded warehouses. The term was later used more generally to refer to the stretch of the river from Rotherhithe upriver to London Bridge, with the venerable bridge being the farthest reach that could be navigated by a tall-masted vessel.


The Pool of London was of vital importance to the capital for centuries – as early as the 7th century Bede wrote that it was the reason for London&#x27;s existence – but it reached its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries. By this time the river was lined with nearly-continuous walls of wharves running for miles along both banks, and hundreds of ships moored in the river or alongside the quays.

The Pool of London saw a phenomenal increase in both overseas and coastal trade in the second half of the eighteenth century. Two-thirds of coastal vessels using it were colliers meeting an increase in the demand for coal as the population of London rose. Coastal trade virtually doubled between 1750 and 1796 reaching 11,964 vessels in 1795. In overseas trade, in 1751 the Pool of London handled 1,682 ships and 234,639 tons of goods but by 1794 this had risen to 3,663 ships and 620,845 tons. 

The congestion was so extreme that it was said to be possible to walk across the Thames simply by stepping from ship to ship. London&#x27;s Docklands had their origins in the lack of capacity in the Pool of London which particularly affected the West India trade. The West India Dock Act 1799 allowed a new off-river dock to be built for produce from the West Indies and the rest of Docklands followed as landowners built enclosed docks with better security and facilities than the Pool&#x27;s wharves.

Even after the construction of off-river docks, the Pool of London remained an important part of the Port of London. Shipping needed unrestricted access to the Pool of London which imposed constraints on the crossings that became increasingly necessary with the commercial development on both sides of the river. The Thames Tunnel from Rotherhithe to Wapping was constructed between 1825 and 1843. Tower Bridge opened in 1894 as a bascule bridge. In 1909 the Pool came under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority. The docks thrived up until the 1950s, despite suffering extremely severe bomb damage during the Second World War.
The abrupt collapse of commercial traffic in the Thames due to the introduction of shipping containers and coastal deep-water ports in the 1960s emptied the Pool and led to all of the wharves being closed down, and many being demolished. The area was extensively redeveloped in the 1980s and 1990s to create new residential and commercial neighbourhoods.

==Urban renewal==
In 1996, an organisation - the Pool of London Partnership - was established to help promote urban renewal of the areas north and south of the river. It also extended its remit slightly further eastwards to include the docks and wharves of St Katharine Docks and Shad Thames. After a decade of regeneration and an investment of approximately £100m, the Pool of London Partnership was due to dissolve in March 2007 with its work to be partially continued by three new organisations: Team London Bridge, the Potters Fields Park Management Trust and the Tower Hill Management Group.

The &#x27;core area&#x27; includes Borough Market, London Bridge, Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London Bridge station, Hay&#x27;s Galleria, HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;, City Hall, Shad Thames, Tower Bridge, St Katharine Docks, the Tower of London, Tower Hill Underground station and the Monument to the Great Fire of London.

==Cultural references==
André Derain painted four works of the Thames, and his 1906 &quot;The Pool of London&quot; is in the UK Tate collection. Derain was a leading Fauvist and had been sent to London by his dealer to produce Thames views in the Fauvist style.

A British film, &quot;Pool of London&quot; (1951), is a crime drama set within the Pool. The film was directed by Basil Dearden, and features actors Earl Cameron, Susan Shaw, Joan Dowling, and Bonar Colleano, and comic actors Leslie Phillips, Alfie Bass and James Robertson Justice. The Pool has also featured as a location in various other films.

Patrick O&#x27;Brian refers to the Pool of London in his novels &quot;The Commodore&quot; and &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot;, both in the Aubrey-Maturin series.

Neal Stephenson mentions various locations around the Pool of London in his novel &quot;The System of the World&quot;, the third book in The Baroque Cycle.

<text>In computer science, a tagged union, also called a variant, variant record, choice type, discriminated union, [[disjoint union]], sum type, or [[coproduct]], is a data structure used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types. Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a tag field explicitly indicates which type is in use. It can be thought of as a type that has several &quot;cases&quot;, each of which should be handled correctly when that type is manipulated. This is critical in defining recursive datatypes, in which some component of a value may have the same type as that value, for example in defining a type for representing trees, where it is necessary to distinguish multi-node subtrees and leaves. Like ordinary unions, tagged unions can save storage by overlapping storage areas for each type, since only one is in use at a time.

==Description==
Tagged unions are most important in functional programming languages such as ML and Haskell, where they are called &quot;datatypes&quot; (see algebraic data type) and the compiler can verify that all cases of a tagged union are always handled, avoiding many types of errors. Compile-time checked sum types are also extensively used in Rust, where they are called &quot;enum&quot;. They can, however, be constructed in nearly any programming language, and are much safer than untagged unions, often simply called unions, which are similar but do not explicitly track which member of a union is currently in use.

Tagged unions are often accompanied by the concept of a constructor, which is similar but not the same as a constructor for a class. A constructor is a function or an expression that produces a value of the tagged union type, given a tag and a value of the corresponding type.

Mathematically, tagged unions correspond to &quot;disjoint&quot; or &quot;discriminated unions&quot;, usually written using +. Given an element of a disjoint union &quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot;, it is possible to determine whether it came from &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;. If an element lies in both, there will be two effectively distinct copies of the value in &quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot;, one from &quot;A&quot; and one from &quot;B&quot;.

In type theory, a tagged union is called a &quot;sum type&quot;. Sum types are the dual of product types. Notations vary, but usually the sum type comes with two introduction forms (injections) and The elimination form is case analysis, known as pattern matching in ML-style languages: if has type and and have type formula_1 under the assumptions and respectively, then the term formula_2 has type formula_1. The sum type corresponds to intuitionistic logical disjunction under the Curry–Howard correspondence.

An enumerated type can be seen as a degenerate case: a tagged union of unit types. It corresponds to a set of nullary constructors and may be implemented as a simple tag variable, since it holds no additional data besides the value of the tag.

Many programming techniques and data structures, including rope, lazy evaluation, class hierarchy (see below), arbitrary-precision arithmetic, CDR coding, the indirection bit, and other kinds of tagged pointers, are usually implemented using some sort of tagged union.

A tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of self-describing data format.
The tag of the tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of metadata.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The primary advantage of a tagged union over an untagged union is that all accesses are safe, and the compiler can even check that all cases are handled. Untagged unions depend on program logic to correctly identify the currently active field, which may result in strange behavior and hard-to-find bugs if that logic fails.

The primary advantage of a tagged union over a simple record containing a field for each type is that it saves storage by overlapping storage for all the types. Some implementations reserve enough storage for the largest type, while others dynamically adjust the size of a tagged union value as needed. When the value is immutable, it is simple to allocate just as much storage as is needed.

The main disadvantage of tagged unions is that the tag occupies space. Since there are usually a small number of alternatives, the tag can often be squeezed into 2 or 3 bits wherever space can be found, but sometimes even these bits are not available. In this case, a helpful alternative may be folded, computed or encoded tags, where the tag value is dynamically computed from the contents of the union field. Common examples are the use of &quot;reserved values&quot;, where, for example, a function returning a positive number may return -1 to indicate failure, and sentinel values, most often used in tagged pointers.

Sometimes, untagged unions are used to perform bit-level conversions between types, called reinterpret casts in C++. Tagged unions are not intended for this purpose; typically a new value is assigned whenever the tag is changed.

Many languages support, to some extent, a universal data type, which is a type that includes every value of every other type, and often a way is provided to test the actual type of a value of the universal type. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;variants&quot;. While universal data types are comparable to tagged unions in their formal definition, typical tagged unions include a relatively small number of cases, and these cases form different ways of expressing a single coherent concept, such as a data structure node or instruction. Also, there is an expectation that every possible case of a tagged union will be dealt with when it is used. The values of a universal data type are not related and there is no feasible way to deal with them all.

Like option types and exception handling, tagged unions are sometimes used to handle the occurrence of exceptional results. Often these tags are folded into the type as &quot;reserved values&quot;, and their occurrence is not consistently checked: this is a fairly common source of programming errors. This use of tagged unions can be formalized as a monad with the following functions:

:formula_4
:formula_5

where &quot;value&quot; and &quot;err&quot; are the constructors of the union type, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are valid result types and &quot;E&quot; is the type of error conditions. Alternately, the same monad may be described by &quot;return&quot; and two additional functions, &quot;fmap&quot; and &quot;join&quot;:

:formula_6
:formula_7

==Examples==
Say we wanted to build a binary tree of integers. In ML, we would do this by creating a datatype like this:
datatype tree = Leaf
 | Node of (int * tree * tree)
This is a tagged union with two cases: one, the leaf, is used to terminate a path of the tree, and functions much like a null value would in imperative languages. The other branch holds a node, which contains an integer and a left and right subtree. Leaf and Node are the constructors, which enable us to actually produce a particular tree, such as:
Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))
which corresponds to this tree:

Now we can easily write a typesafe function that, for example, counts the number of nodes in the tree:
fun countNodes(Leaf) = 0
 | countNodes(Node(int, left, right)) =
 1 + countNodes(left) + countNodes(right)
==Timeline of language support==

===1960s===
In ALGOL 68, tagged unions are called &quot;united modes&quot;, the tag is implicit, and the codice_1 construct is used to determine which field is tagged:

codice_2

Usage example for codice_3 codice_1 of codice_5:

 node n := &quot;1234&quot;;
 case n in
 (real r): print((&quot;real:&quot;, r)),
 (int i): print((&quot;int:&quot;, i)),
 (compl c): print((&quot;compl:&quot;, c)),
 (string s): print((&quot;string:&quot;, s))
 out print((&quot;?:&quot;, n))
 esac

===1970s &amp; 1980s===
Functional programming languages such as ML (from the 1970s) and Haskell (from the 1990s) give a central role to tagged unions and have the power to check that all cases are handled. Some other languages also support tagged unions.

Pascal, Ada, and Modula-2 call them &quot;variant records&quot; (formally &quot;discriminated type&quot; in Ada), and require the tag field to be manually created and the tag values specified, as in this Pascal example:
type shapeKind = (square, rectangle, circle);
 shape = record
 centerx : integer;
 centery : integer;
 case kind : shapeKind of
 square : (side : integer);
 rectangle : (width, height : integer);
 circle : (radius : integer);
 end;
and this Ada equivalent:

type Shape_Kind is (Square, Rectangle, Circle);
type Shape (Kind : Shape_Kind) is record
 Center_X : Integer;
 Center_Y : Integer;
 case Kind is
 when Square =&gt;
 Side : Integer;
 when Rectangle =&gt;
 Width, Height : Integer;
 when Circle =&gt;
 Radius : Integer;
 end case;
end record;

-- Any attempt to access a member which existence depends
-- on a certain value of the discriminant, while the
-- discriminant is not the expected one, raises an error.
In C and C++, a tagged union can be created from untagged unions using a strict access discipline where the tag is always checked:
enum ShapeKind { Square, Rectangle, Circle };

struct Shape {
 int centerx;
 int centery;
 enum ShapeKind kind;
 union {
 struct { int side; }; /* Square */
 struct { int width, height; }; /* Rectangle */
 struct { int radius; }; /* Circle */
};

int getSquareSide(struct Shape* s) {
 assert(s-&gt;kind == Square);
 return s-&gt;side;

void setSquareSide(struct Shape* s, int side) {
 s-&gt;kind = Square;
 s-&gt;side = side;

/* and so on */
As long as the union fields are only accessed through the functions, the accesses will be safe and correct. The same approach can be used for encoded tags; we simply decode the tag and then check it on each access. If the inefficiency of these tag checks is a concern, they may be automatically removed in the final version.

C and C++ also have language support for one particular tagged union: the possibly-null pointer. This may be compared to the codice_6 type in ML or the codice_7 type in Haskell, and can be seen as a tagged pointer: a tagged union (with an encoded tag) of two types:
* Valid pointers,
* A null pointer type with only one value, codice_8, indicating an exceptional condition.
Unfortunately, C compilers do not verify that the null case is always handled. This is a particularly common source of errors in C code, since there is a tendency to ignore exceptional cases.

===2000s===
One advanced dialect of C, called Cyclone, has extensive built-in support for tagged unions.

The enum types in the Rust, Haxe, and Swift languages also work as tagged unions.

The variant library from the Boost C++ Libraries demonstrated it was possible to implement a safe tagged union as a library in C++, visitable using function objects.

struct display : boost::static_visitor&lt;void&gt;
 void operator()(int i)
 std::cout « &quot;It&#x27;s an int, with value &quot; « i « std::endl;

 void operator()(const std::string&amp; s)
 std::cout « &quot;It&#x27;s a string, with value &quot; « s « std::endl;
};

boost::variant&lt;int, std::string&gt; v = 42;
boost::apply_visitor(display(), v);

boost::variant&lt;int, std::string&gt; v = &quot;hello world&quot;;
boost::apply_visitor(display(), v);
Scala has case classes:

sealed abstract class Tree
case object Leaf extends Tree
case class Node(value: Int, left: Tree, right: Tree) extends Tree

val tree = Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))
Because the class hierarchy is sealed, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:

tree match {
 case Node(x, _, _) =&gt; println(&quot;top level node value: &quot; + x)
 case Leaf =&gt; println(&quot;top level node is a leaf&quot;)


Scala&#x27;s case classes also permit reuse through subtyping:
sealed abstract class Shape(centerX: Int, centerY: Int)
case class Square(side: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)
case class Rectangle(length: Int, height: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)
case class Circle(radius: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)
F# has discriminated unions:
type Tree =
 | Leaf
 | Node of value: int * left: Tree * right: Tree

let tree = Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))
Because the defined cases are exhaustive, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:

match tree with
| Node (x, _, _) -&gt; printfn &quot;top level node value: %i&quot; x
| Leaf -&gt; printfn &quot;top level node is a leaf&quot;
Haxe&#x27;s enums also work as tagged unions:

enum Color {
 Red;
 Green;
 Blue;
 Rgb(r:Int, g:Int, b:Int);


These can be matched using a switch expression:

switch (color) {
 case Red: trace(&quot;Color was red&quot;);
 case Green: trace(&quot;Color was green&quot;);
 case Blue: trace(&quot;Color was blue&quot;);
 case Rgb(r, g, b): trace(&quot;Color had a red value of &quot; +r);
Nim has object variants similar in declaration to those in Pascal and Ada:
type
 ShapeKind = enum
 skSquare, skRectangle, skCircle
 Shape = object
 centerX, centerY: int
 case kind: ShapeKind
 of skSquare:
 side: int
 of skRectangle:
 length, height: int
 of skCircle:
 radius: int
Macros can be used to emulate pattern matching or to create syntactic sugar for declaring object variants, seen here as implemented by the package patty:
import patty

proc `~`[A](a: A): ref A =
 new(result)
 result[] = a

variant List[A]:
 Nil
 Cons(x: A, xs: ref List[A])

proc listHelper[A](xs: seq[A]): List[A] =
 if xs.len == 0: Nil[A]()
 else: Cons(xs[0], ~listHelper(xs[1 .. xs.high]))

proc list[A](xs: varargs[A]): List[A] = listHelper(@xs)

proc sum(xs: List[int]): int = (block:
 match xs:
 Nil: 0
 Cons(y, ys): y + sum(ys[])

echo sum(list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
=== 2010s ===

Enums are added in Scala 3, allowing us to rewrite the earlier Scala examples more concisely:

enum Tree[+T]:
 case Leaf
 case Node(x: Int, left: Tree[T], right: Tree[T])

enum Shape(centerX: Int, centerY: Int):
 case Square(side: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerY, centerX)
 case Rectangle(length: Int, height: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)
 case Circle(radius: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)
The Rust language has extensive support for tagged unions, called enums. For example:

enum Tree {
 Leaf,
 Node(i64, Box&lt;Tree&gt;, Box&lt;Tree&gt;)


It also allows matching on unions:
let tree = Tree::Node(
 2,
 Box::new(Tree::Node(0, Box::new(Tree::Leaf), Box::new(Tree::Leaf))),
 Box::new(Tree::Node(3, Box::new(Tree::Leaf),
 Box::new(Tree::Node(4, Box::new(Tree::Leaf), Box::new(Tree::Leaf)))))

fn add_values(tree: Tree) -&gt; i64 {
 match tree {
 Tree::Node(v, a, b) =&gt; v + add_values(*a) + add_values(*b),
 Tree::Leaf =&gt; 0
}

assert_eq!(add_values(tree), 9);
Rust&#x27;s error handling model relies extensively on these tagged unions, especially the codice_9 type, which is either codice_10 or codice_11, and the codice_12 type, which is either codice_13 or codice_14.

Swift also has substantial support for tagged unions via enumerations. For example:
enum Tree {
 case leaf
 indirect case node(Int, Tree, Tree)

let tree = Tree.node(
 2,
 .node(0, .leaf, .leaf),
 .node(3, .leaf, .node(4, .leaf, .leaf))

func add_values(_ tree: Tree) -&gt; Int {
 switch tree {
 case let .node(v, a, b):
 return v + add_values(a) + add_values(b)

 case .leaf:
 return 0
}

assert(add_values(tree) == 9)

With TypeScript it is also possible to create tagged unions. For example:
interface Leaf { kind: &quot;leaf&quot;; }

interface Node { kind: &quot;node&quot;; value: number; left: Tree; right: Tree; }

type Tree = Leaf | Node

const root: Tree = {
 kind: &quot;node&quot;,
 value: 5,
 left: {
 kind: &quot;node&quot;,
 value: 1,
 left: { kind: &quot;leaf&quot; },
 right: { kind: &quot;leaf&quot; }
 right: {
 kind: &quot;node&quot;,
 value: 3,
 left: { kind: &quot;leaf&quot; },
 right: {
 kind: &quot;node&quot;,
 value: 4,
 left: { kind: &quot;leaf&quot; },
 right: { kind: &quot;leaf&quot; }
 }

function visit(tree: Tree) {
 switch (tree.kind) {
 case &quot;leaf&quot;:
 break
 case &quot;node&quot;:
 console.log(tree.value)
 visit(tree.left)
 visit(tree.right)
 break 
}
Python 3.9 introduces support for typing annotations that can be used to define a tagged union type (PEP-593): 
Currency = Annotated[
 TypedDict(&#x27;Currency&#x27;, {&#x27;dollars&#x27;: float, &#x27;pounds&#x27;: float}, total=False),
 TaggedUnion,
C++17 introduces std::variant and constexpr if

using Tree = std::variant&lt;struct Leaf, struct Node&gt;;

struct Leaf
 std::string value;
struct Node
 Tree* left = nullptr;
 Tree* right = nullptr;

struct Transverser
 template&lt;typename T&gt;
 void operator()(T&amp;&amp; v)
 if constexpr (std::is_same_v&lt;T, Leaf&amp;&gt;)
 std::cout « v.value « &quot;\n&quot;;
 else if constexpr (std::is_same_v&lt;T, Node&amp;&gt;)
 if (v.left != nullptr)
 std::visit(Transverser{}, *v.left);

 if (v.right != nullptr)
 std::visit(Transverser{}, *v.right);
 else
 // The !sizeof(T) expression is always false
 static_assert(!sizeof(T), &quot;non-exhaustive visitor!&quot;);
 }
/*Tree forest = ...;
 std::visit(Transverser{}, forest);*/

== Class hierarchies as tagged unions ==
In a typical class hierarchy in object-oriented programming, each subclass can encapsulate data unique to that class. The metadata used to perform virtual method lookup (for example, the object&#x27;s vtable pointer in most C++ implementations) identifies the subclass and so effectively acts as a tag identifying the data stored by the instance (see RTTI).
An object&#x27;s constructor sets this tag, and it remains constant throughout the object&#x27;s lifetime.

Nevertheless, a class hierarchy involves true subtype polymorphism. It can be extended by creating further subclasses of the same base type, which could not be handled correctly under a tag/dispatch model. Hence, it is usually not possible to do case analysis or dispatch on a subobject&#x27;s &#x27;tag&#x27; as one would for tagged unions. Some languages such as Scala allow base classes to be &quot;sealed&quot;, and unify tagged unions with sealed base classes.

<doc id="453397" wikidata="Q1606789" url="?curid=453397" title="Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Henry George Wakelyn Smith, 1st Baronet, GCB (28 June 1787 – 12 October 1860) was a notable English soldier and military commander in the British Army of the early 19th century. A veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, he is also particularly remembered for his role in the Battle of Aliwal, India in 1846, his subsequent governorship of the Cape Colony, and as the husband of Lady Smith.

==Biography==

He was born in Whittlesey, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, the son of a surgeon and major in the Wisbech, Whittlesey and Thorney United Battalion. 
The east end of the south aisle of St. Mary’s church was at this time partitioned off and used as a schoolroom, the vicar or curate teaching. It was here that Harry Smith received his education from the Rev. George Burgess, then curate. 

During a review of the unit by General Stewart, he got into conversation with the youth and offered to procure him a commission. A short time later a commission as a second lieutenant with the 95th Rifle Regiment arrived. A chapel in the town&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s church was restored in his memory in 1862, and a local community college also bears his name: Sir Harry Smith Community College.

===Napoleonic Wars===

Harry Smith—for throughout life he adopted the more familiar form of his Christian name—was educated privately and was commissioned on 8 May 1805, and then promoted Lieutenant on 15 August. His first active service was in South America in 1806 during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Montevideo in 1807, but first came to real prominence during the Peninsular War. Smith served throughout these campaigns with the 95th Rifles in which he served from 1808 through to the end of the war at the Battle of Toulouse in 1814. In 1810 he was appointed ADC to Colonel Beckwith. Early in 1812, on 28 February, he was promoted Captain, having already the previous March joined the 2nd brigade Light Division as major to the Major-Generals staff. On 7 April, the day following the storming of Badajoz a well-born Spanish lady, whose entire property in the city had been destroyed, presented herself at the British lines seeking protection from the licence of the soldiery for herself and her sister, a child of fourteen. The latter, Juana Maria de Los Dolores de León, had but recently emerged from a convent; but notwithstanding her years she was married to Harry Smith a few days later. She accompanied him throughout the rest of the war.

At the close of the war, Harry Smith volunteered for service in the United States, where he was present at the Battle of Bladensburg on 24 August 1814, and witnessed the burning of the capitol at Washington; which, as he said, &quot;horrified us coming fresh from the Duke&#x27;s humane warfare in the south of France.&quot;

Returning to Europe he was a brigade major at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, and afterwards rewarded as Assistant Quartermaster-General to the division. During the occupation of France he was sent to be Mayor of Cambrai in Picardy. With the restoration of peace in France he returned to divisional ADC at Glasgow for Major-General Reynell, GOC Western District of Scotland. Smith impressed Reynell, who helped his appointment as ADC to the Governor of Nova Scotia, Lieutenant-General Sir James Kempt in 1826.
===Xhosa Kingdom===
Smith was promoted Major in the army by the end of 1826, but remained unattached to a regimental posting, and was still unattached when raised to Lieutenant-colonel in July 1830. In 1828 Smith was ordered to the Cape of Good Hope, where he commanded a force in the Sixth Xhosa War of 1834-36. In 1835 he accomplished the feat of riding the 550 miles from Cape Town to Grahamstown in less than six days; after he had restored confidence among the whites by his energetic measures, he was appointed governor of the Province of Queen Adelaide, where he gained influence over the native tribes, whom he vigorously set himself to civilize and benefit.

But though Sir Benjamin D&#x27;Urban, the high commissioner, supported Smith, the ministry in London reversed his policy and, to quote Smith&#x27;s own words, &quot;directed the Province of Queen Adelaide to be restored to barbarism.&quot; Smith himself was removed from his command, his departure being deplored alike by Bantu and Boers. Many Boers, largely in consequence of this policy of Lord Glenelg, began the migration to the interior known as the Great Trek.

===India===
Smith was appointed Adjutant-General in India in 1840, where he took part in the Gwalior campaign of 1843, for which he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). From 1845 to 1846, he fought in the First Anglo-Sikh War. He was in command of a division under Sir Hugh Gough at the battles of Mudki and Ferozeshah, where he conspicuously distinguished himself, but was insufficiently supported by the commander-in-chief. After the second of these actions, Smith was appointed to an independent command, and on 28 January 1846 he inflicted a crushing defeat on the Sikhs at Aliwal on the Sutlej.

At the Battle of Sobraon on 10 February he again commanded a division under Gough. For the great victory of Aliwal he was awarded the thanks of Parliament; and the speech of the Duke of Wellington was perhaps the warmest encomium ever bestowed by that great commander on a meritorious officer. Smith was at the same time created a baronet; and as a special distinction the words &quot;of Aliwal&quot; were by the patent appended to the title. He was promoted to Major-General on 9 November 1846.

===Return to South Africa===
In 1847 he returned to South Africa as Governor of Cape Colony and high commissioner, with the local rank of Lieutenant-General, to grapple with the difficulties he had foreseen eleven years before. Issues he faced ranged from domestic problems within the colony, such as the Convict Crisis of 1849, as well as external threats such as instability on the Cape&#x27;s eastern frontier.

He took command of an expedition to deal with the disaffected Boers in the Orange River Sovereignty, and fought the Battle of Boomplaats on 29 August 1848.
It has been asserted that &quot;the half-mad Smith&#x27;s&quot; seizure of the entire region of &quot;British Kaffraria&quot; in 1848 was launched and carried out &quot;entirely on his own initiative.&quot; Piers Brendon described &quot;Smith, placing his foot on the neck of the Xhosan soldier and proclaiming, &#x27;I am your Paramount Chief, and the K*****s are my dogs!&#x27;&quot;

In December 1850 war broke out with the Xhosa and some of the Khoikhoi; Sir Harry Smith was insufficiently supplied with troops from England; and though his conduct of the operations was warmly approved by the Duke of Wellington and other military authorities, Earl Grey, in a dispatch never submitted to the queen, recalled him in 1852 before the Xhosa and Khoikhoi had been completely subdued. He protested strongly against the abandonment of the Orange River Sovereignty to the Boers, which was carried out two years after his departure, and he actively furthered the granting of responsible government to Cape Colony.

His wife Juana gave her name to Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal as well as Ladismith in the Western Cape province. Harrismith in the Free State was named after Smith himself (two other towns, Aliwal North in the Eastern Cape and Smithfield in the Free State, also mark Smith&#x27;s connection with South Africa).

Impressed by the showing of the Cape Mounted Riflemen under his command, Smith created Sir Harry Smith&#x27;s Medal for Gallantry in recognition of their conduct.

===Back in England===

In 1853 he was made General Officer Commanding Western District back in England. He was given brevet promotion to lieutenant-general on 20 June 1854 and appointed GOC Northern District in 1856.

After a long illness he died at his home at Eton Place, London, on 12 October 1860. He was buried at St Mary&#x27;s, Whittlesey, where he is commemorated with a marble bust and memorial. That section of the church is known as Sir Harry&#x27;s Chapel. His wife, Juana, deceased 10 October 1872, is interred with him.

His autobiography, first published posthumously in 1901, is regarded as a classic of love and war.

The story of Harry Smith and his wife in the Peninsular Campaign and the Battle of Waterloo is narrated in Georgette Heyer&#x27;s novel &quot;The Spanish Bride&quot; (1940).

<doc id="453401" wikidata="Q1755500" url="?curid=453401" title="Rumble Pak">
<text>The is a removable device from Nintendo that provides force feedback while playing video games. Games that support the Rumble Pak cause it to vibrate in select situations, such as when firing a weapon or receiving damage, to immerse the player in the game. Versions of the Rumble Pak are available for the Nintendo 64, the Nintendo DS, and the Nintendo DS Lite. A select few Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance (GBA) games use a similar technology built into the game cartridge. Force feedback vibration has become a built-in standard feature in almost every home video game console controller since.

==Nintendo 64==

The original Rumble Pak, designed for the Nintendo 64 controller, was released in April 1997 in Japan, July 1997 in North America, and October 1997 in Europe. It requires two AAA batteries and is inserted into the controller&#x27;s memory cartridge slot, which prevents simultaneous use of the Controller Pak. This does not significantly affect games that feature on-cartridge save functions, but is a drawback with games that require the Controller Pak to save, as software by default was not designed to support hot swapping Paks, although some games support saving to a Controller Pak in a second controller. Nintendo remedied the situation in later games by offering developers the inclusion of special screens for hot swapping. The Rumble Pak is estimated to provide 50-60 hours of continuous rumbling before the batteries must be replaced.

Originally named &quot;Jolting Pak&quot;, it was announced as what IGN called &quot;the biggest surprise&quot; of the 1996 Shoshinkai show. The Rumble Pak was introduced bundled with the game &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; (known as &quot;Lylat Wars&quot; in the PAL region) and made available as a separate purchase two months later. Rumble Pak support soon became a standard for N64 games. &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; were re-released in Japan in July 1997 with Rumble Pak support.

Several third party versions of the Rumble Pak, such as the Tremor Pak, followed. Some draw power from the controller instead of batteries, but the lower power makes them less effective. The TremorPak Plus allows a memory card to be inserted simultaneously, eliminating the need to switch between two accessories. The Nyko Hyper Pak Plus contains internal memory and allows the user to adjust the amount of feedback between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;too hard&quot;. Though it does not allow the use of rumble and memory functions simultaneously, users can toggle between the two functions by flipping a switch, instead of having to swap accessories.

=== Reception ===
Atomic Dawg&#x27;s review of the Rumble Pak in &quot;GamePro&quot; described it as &quot;cute, gimmicky - and actually kind of fun.&quot; When reviewing &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, IGN praised the Rumble Pak, stating that it &quot;adds an unusual burst of arcade ecstasy to the game&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; commented, &quot;Sure, a vibrating joystick may sound lame - even a little naughty - but trust us: it&#x27;s cool. The Pak&#x27;s only drawback is that it slips into your analog stick&#x27;s memory cartridge port and doesn&#x27;t offer a through port.&quot; The magazine&#x27;s &quot;review crew&quot; later reviewed the standalone release of the Rumble Pak, giving it an 8.5 out of 10. While Kraig Kujawa and John Ricciardi commented that its usage in games thus far had been as a gimmick rather than an enhancement to the actual gameplay, Kelly Rickards and Sushi-X lauded its usage in games such as &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, and all four of them praised the low retail price of the unit, saying that at worst gamers risk little by purchasing it. At their 1997 Editors&#x27; Choice Awards, they named it &quot;Best Peripheral&quot;.

IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan wrote an 11th birthday article on the Nintendo 64&#x27;s Rumble Pak, describing how its influence led to rumble being &quot;an industry standard within a single generation&quot;. He said that it is bulky and heavy when attached to the Nintendo 64 controller, but that &quot;the trade-off was actually worth it&quot;.

More recently, in TWGNews&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Controller Innovations&quot; article, the Rumble Pak is listed as #8, saying &quot;the Rumble Pak added a whole new level of immersion to the fifth generation of video games&quot;.

The Rumble Pak for the Nintendo DS is an official DS Option Pak shaped like a Game Boy Advance Game Pak and is designed to be inserted in the system&#x27;s GBA game slot (SLOT-2). It is the first Nintendo DS accessory to have utilized the slot. In North America, it was first made available bundled with &quot;Metroid Prime Pinball&quot;, but was later sold through other promotions or as a stand-alone purchase from Nintendo&#x27;s online store. The accessory was released differently in Europe due to a delay of &quot;Metroid Prime Pinball&quot; in that region. Various DS games supporting the Rumble Pak (&quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot;, &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time&quot;, and &quot;42 All-Time Classics&quot;) had been released in Europe before the accessory was available. The accessory was eventually released as a pack-in with the game &quot;Actionloop&quot; in the UK.

Although the Rumble Pak works with both the Nintendo DS and the redesigned Nintendo DS Lite, it protrudes from the Nintendo DS Lite when inserted, as do GBA Game Paks, because of the Nintendo DS Lite&#x27;s smaller size. For this reason, a smaller version of the Rumble Pak is available in Japan, which is flush with the system when inserted. It was initially available in just black, but other colors produced by unlicensed accessory manufacturer eWin, such as white (see picture), have been released. Other color variations have been released by eWin.

Some GBA flash cartridges (SLOT-2 flash cartridges) have a built-in rumble feature that, when used in tandem with a SLOT-1 flash card on a Nintendo DS, can provide rumble as if it was an ordinary Rumble Pak.

The Nintendo DS Rumble Pak is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL, as both consoles lack a SLOT-2. However, none of the games supporting the Rumble Pak require it for proper operation of the game, meaning that the games themselves are still compatible with DSi (some software titles, such as Nintendo DS Browser and &quot;Guitar Hero: On Tour&quot;, have SLOT-2 peripherals that are required for operation, and are hence incompatible with DSi and DSi XL, although the former already has an alternative version made specifically for the Nintendo DSi and later consoles). Although Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL lack the SLOT-2, some Nintendo DS titles released after the Nintendo DSi&#x27;s launch do support the Rumble Pak accessory, likely due to the fact the Nintendo DS Lite console was sold concurrently with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL.

=== Reception ===
The Nintendo DS Rumble Pak was initially met with criticism as reviewers pointed out the limited number of games compatible with the card (at the time only four were compatible). Reviewers also pointed out the annoying &quot;squealing noise&quot; or &quot;electronic chirp&quot; that the device made when &#x27;rumbling&#x27;. IGN stated that &quot;Good thing it&#x27;s free, because at this point we wouldn&#x27;t bother buying it as an extra.&quot; Up until the removal of the expansion slot from later Nintendo DS models, the DS Rumble Pak was supported by 51 games in total.

==Game Boy family==
While there is no dedicated Rumble Pak for the Game Boy family (Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance), due to these more primitive systems lacking an expansion slot, there were several games released for the Game Boy&#x27;s successors that featured built-in rumble. Game Boy Color games with built-in rumble, such as &quot;10-Pin Bowling&quot;, &quot;Vigilante 8&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Episode I: Racer&quot;, were released as bulkier Game Paks with an added rumble motor powered by an extra AAA battery that is inserted into the Game Pak itself. The only two Game Boy Advance games that feature built-in rumble, &quot;Drill Dozer&quot; and &quot;&quot;, draw power from the system itself and thus do not require an extra battery or a specially enlarged Game Pak. &quot;Twisted&quot; also rumbles weakly whenever its special built-in piezoelectric gyroscope for its motion controls are utilized. Other Game Boy Advance games, such as &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot;, support rumble when played on a Game Boy Player for the GameCube, utilizing its controller&#x27;s built-in vibration.

<doc id="453404" wikidata="Q464691" url="?curid=453404" title="The Stars, Like Dust">
<text>The Stars, Like Dust is a 1951 science fiction mystery book by American writer Isaac Asimov.

The book is part of Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; series and takes place before the actual founding of the Galactic Empire, before even Trantor becomes important. It starts with a young man attending the University of Earth. Biron Farrill is the son of the greatest nobleman on the planet Nephelos, one of the Nebula Kingdoms. The story starts with the news that his father has been caught conspiring against the Tyranni.

The Tyranni, who come from the planet Tyrann, rule a minor empire of 50 planets near the Horsehead Nebula. Tyrann suppressed science and space navigation training in the kingdoms to help maintain control over its subject worlds. The ruler of Tyrann in the story is called the &quot;Khan,&quot; suggesting that Asimov took the Mongol dominion over the Russian principalities as a model, much as he used the declining Roman Empire for his &quot;Foundation&quot; series. (See the &quot;Golden Horde&quot; for the real-world history that Asimov drew upon and adapted.)

Asimov once called it his &quot;least favorite novel.&quot;

==Publication history==
The story was first published with the title &quot;Tyrann&quot; in &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine. It was serialised in three parts in the January, February, and March 1951 issues. It was published as a novel on February 15 of that year by Doubleday with the title &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot;. It was first published as a paperback in 1954 with the title &quot;The Rebellious Stars&quot;: however, this version of the story was heavily cut without Asimov&#x27;s permission and was bound together with &quot;An Earth Gone Mad&quot; by Roger Dee.

==Context==
The story is set long before &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;, but it was written one year later. The Trantorian Empire is not directly mentioned; it would be located far away, having been settled not long beforehand and before its first great wave of territorial expansion. Earth&#x27;s radioactivity is explained as the result of an unspecified nuclear war. 

That contradicts what Asimov later wrote in &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;. One could suppose that history has become muddled over the intervening centuries since the final &quot;Robot&quot; novel: &quot;many of the inhabitants of the planets near the Horsehead Nebula now believe it was named after an explorer called Horace Hedd.&quot; Other theories exist, and when Biron pretends on Rhodia that he comes from Earth, the Earth is not recognized, and he has to identify it as &quot;a small planet of the Sirian Sector.&quot;

In contemporary terms, however, Asimov wrote the &quot;Empire series&quot; in the early years of the Cold War, when a nuclear World War Three seemed a realistic future; its widespread and enduring radioactive contamination might be remembered, at least in folklore, for thousands of years. By the time he wrote &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, that was no longer so. However, in the intervening years, he had mentioned the contamination and the resulting abandonment of Earth in many stories. He therefore retained both elements but gave a different cause than nuclear war.

==Plot==

Biron Farrill, about to complete studies at the University of Earth, is told by Sander Jonti that his father, a rich planetary leader who is known as Lord Rancher of Widemos, has been arrested and killed by the Tyranni and that his own life may be in danger. On Jonti&#x27;s advice, he travels to Rhodia, the strongest of the conquered planets. There, from the Director of Rhodia&#x27;s cousin Gillbret, he hears rumours of a world on which rebellion against the Tyranni is secretly being plotted.

Escaping with Artemisia oth Hinriad, the daughter of the Director of Rhodia, and her uncle Gillbret in a Tyranni spaceship, they travel to the planet Lingane. It is not part of the Tyranni conquests but maintains &quot;peaceful&quot; relations with them.

There, they meet the Autarch of Lingane, who is revealed to be Sander Jonti, the man who sent Farrill to Rhodia from Earth, who seems to possess knowledge of a rebellion world. With him and his followers, the group travel to the heart of the Horsehead Nebula as they believe that for any rebellion world to exist and not be known to the Tyranni, it must be located in a place like the Horsehead Nebula.

The Tyranni spaceship that was stolen by Farrill is being tracked by a fleet of Tyranni vessels led by Simok Aratap, the Tyrannian Commissioner. With him is the Director, who is shown to be nervous about the well-being of his daughter and his brother. They keep themselves at a distance for fear of discovery until Farrill lands on one planet in the heart of the nebula.

The Autarch believes that the planet is the rebellion world. However, there is no sign of life anywhere. When the Autarch and Farrill leave the spaceship, apparently to set up a radio transmitter, Farrill faces the Autarch and accuses him of getting his father killed at the hands of the Tyranni. The Autarch affirms the accusation, and Farrill adds that the Autarch feared his father&#x27;s growing reputation and so caused Farrill&#x27;s father&#x27;s death.

In a fight, Farrill subdues the Autarch with help from the Autarch&#x27;s aide, Tedor Rizzet, who reveals that he is ashamed of the Autarch for killing a great man like Farrill&#x27;s father. Later, as Farrill and Rizzet try to explain everything to the rest of the crew they picked up from Lingane, the Tyranni fleet arrives and takes them prisoner. Aratap interrogates Farrill, Artemisia, Gillbret, and Rizzet to ascertain the co-ordinates of the rebellion world, but they do not know where it is. However, the Autarch reveals the information to Aratap. Rizzet kills the Autarch with a blaster in anger.

While Aratap interrogates Farrill, Gillbret manages to escape to the engine room of the spaceship and short the hyperatomics. Farrill, realizing the danger, manages to contact Aratap. The engines are repaired, but Gillbret is injured and later dies.

The space jump is made with the co-ordinates given to them by the late Autarch. However, they find a planetless system with only a white-dwarf star. Aratap lets Farrill and the others go, believing that there is no rebellion world. Aratap makes it clear that he will never be chosen as Director. Biron and Artemisia are allowed to marry.

It is eventually revealed that there is indeed a rebellion in the making, on Rhodia itself, with the Director as its leader; he deliberately took on the persona of a nervous and timid old man to throw off suspicion from himself and his planet.

It is further revealed that the Director, who possesses a collection of ancient documents, has searched for and has found a document that will help a future empire, likely Trantor, govern the galaxy. The document is eventually revealed to be the United States Constitution.

==Reception==
Asimov noted in his autobiography that the genesis of the Constitution subplot lay with H. L. Gold, the editor of &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine. Asimov felt that Gold&#x27;s judgment was at fault by attributing too much power to the Constitution as a document. Asimov later considered the premise highly improbable and became annoyed at Gold for having persuaded him to insert the subplot into the novel. Whatever Asimov&#x27;s opinion of the novel, he never actually withdrew it from publication.

&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Groff Conklin termed the novel &quot;a first-rate piece of imaginative story-telling&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Floyd C. Gale told readers &quot;Don&#x27;t miss&quot; it and the other Empire novels. In &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, Villiers Gerson declared the novel successful despite its &quot;unidimensional&quot; characters because of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s skill as a story-teller of suspense.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the novel &quot;a rousing adventure story of the remote future.&quot;

Reviewer Jane Fowler noted, &quot;Making the re-discovery of the United States Constitution into the climax of the plot implies that the space civilization depicted is going to take up this Constitution as a model for building a new political structure, that the &quot;space feudalism&quot; which dominates the political system depicted in the book will be transformed into some kind of a federal, representative democracy. That could have worked fine if this was a stand-alone novel. As part of a series, it does not work because we know that galactic civilization is not going to develop in this way. Trantor will expand and expand, until the entire galaxy is included in its empire. Trantor and its empire have many points in their favor, but it is not a democratic federation. So, the re-discovery of the US Constitution led nowhere, it did not shape a new political reality, and in the end probably ended up right back in a collection of old documents. Of course, the fact is that when Asimov wrote this he probably did not yet fully realize that this was going to be an integral part of a comprehensive long series.&quot;

<text>John Holbrook Powers (c. 1831–1918), who was known as &quot;Honest John,&quot; was a Nebraska pioneer who ran for governor as a populist in 1892. Powers was born in Madison County, Illinois, and served in the Union Army in the Civil War before moving to Nebraska. In 1884, Powers joined the Farmers&#x27; Alliance and rose rapidly in the organization. In 1892, he was nominated as the gubenarorial candidate of the People&#x27;s Party, the political wing of the Alliance. Of the three candidates, Powers received the most votes, but after a long and bitter fight, James E. Boyd, the Democrat, was declared elected. In his &quot;History of Nebraska&quot;, James Olson described Powers as &quot;a modest man who lived in a sod house on his homestead in Hitchcock County.&quot;(Page 222).

Robert B. Crosby, the Republican Governor of Nebraska from 1954 to 1955, was John Powers&#x27; great grandson.

<text>Acamapichtli ( , meaning &quot;Handful of reeds&quot;) was the first &quot;Tlatoani&quot;, or king, of the Aztecs (or Mexica) of Tenochtitlan, and founder of the Aztec imperial dynasty. Chronicles differ as to the dates of his reign: according to the Codex Chimalpahin, he reigned from 1367 to 1387; according to the Codex Aubin, he reigned from 1376 to 1395; and according to the Codex Chimalpopoca, he reigned from 1350 to 1403.

== Biography ==

=== Family and early life ===
Acamapichtli was not a native of Tenochtitlan. Blood relationships between rulers were an important aspect of politics in 14th century Mexico, and as relative newcomers, the Mexicans were at a disadvantage. On the death of Tenoch, the elders of the Mexica &quot;calpultin&quot; decided to elect a &quot;tlatoani&quot; who could secure the fledgling city&#x27;s position through ties to powerful groups in the region. They sent a delegation to the leaders of Culhuacan. Although the Culhua had only recently ejected the Mexica from Tizaapan, some intermarriage had taken place between the two peoples during their period of association. Acamapichtli was the product of one such union. His father, Opochtli Iztahuatzin, was a Mexican leader, while his mother Atotoztli I was the daughter of the King Coxcoxtli and sister of King Huehue Acamapichtli. He also had ties to the Acolhua of Coatlinchan. In addition to these concrete ties, the Culhua nobility claimed direct descent from the Toltecs, making their bloodline particularly prestigious.

The Spanish colonial historians Diego Durán, Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl, and Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc each mention Acamapichtli&#x27;s maternal uncle, who occupied the throne of Culhuacan in 1324.

=== Reign ===

Acamapichtli began his rule as &quot;cihuacóatl&quot; (governor). At the time of his designation he was 20 years old, living in Texcoco with his mother. After his acceptance of the throne, he was brought to Tenochtitlan and made his entry into the city with great pomp. He married Ilancueitl, daughter of the then ruler of Culhuacán, Acolmiztli.

To integrate these ties with the city of Tenochtitlan, Acamapichtli took a wife from each Tenochtitlan &quot;calpulli&quot; (in addition to his first wife Ilancuetl).

In the same year, Tenochtitlan&#x27;s sister city of Tlatelolco also installed an outsider as &quot;tlatoani&quot; — Cuacuapitzahuac, son of Tezozómoc, &quot;tlatoani&quot; of the Tepanec city of Azcapotzalco, the other major power in the region.

Despite Acamapichtli&#x27;s Culhua ancestry, his city rapidly fell into the Tepanec orbit and became a tributary of Azcapotzalco. During his reign Mexica forces fought for Azcapotzalco against various city states, notably Chalco, and were eventually allowed to wage war on their own. Expeditions were sent against Cuauhnahuac (modern Cuernavaca) and Xochimilco.

Tribute was due to the Tecpanec rulers every full moon, a tribute said to be oppressive and capricious. In spite of the hostility of Azcapotzalco, Tenochtitlan progressed. The island on which the city was situated (and the only territory subject to its rule) was enlarged to the east with the addition of dirt and rock. The Mexica were careful, however, to maintain a proper distance from the mainland, for defensive purposes in the event of war.

Built in the middle of Lake Texcoco, Tenochtitlan suffered from limited farmland. Acamapichtli built up the city&#x27;s agricultural base by expanding the &quot;chinampa&quot; system (&quot;floating&quot; gardens) around the island, and by capturing lakeshore chinampas from other cities, particularly Xochimilco. He also made improvements to the city&#x27;s architecture — the earliest excavated level of the Great Pyramid, Temple II, dates to his reign.

During his reign, the city was divided into four neighborhoods or &quot;calpullis&quot;: Moyotlán in the southwest; Zoquipan in the southeast; Cuecopan in the northwest; and Atzacualco in the northeast. Houses of cane and reeds were replaced with houses of stone. A great temple, or &quot;teocalli&quot;, was also constructed. It is said that during his reign, the first Aztec laws were made.

In 1382, Acamapichtli was named &quot;tlatoani&quot;. He was crowned with even more pomp than before, at the altar of Huitzilopochtli. He ascended the steps accompanied by the highest-ranking warriors. He was anointed with oil and water by the chief priest, who placed on his head the crown or &quot;xiuhuitzolli&quot;. This same ceremony was repeated in all the subsequent Aztec coronations, with the difference that, from 1427, the new &quot;tlatoani&quot; was accompanied by the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan, the other two towns of the Aztec Triple Alliance.

Acamapichtli was an astute politician who strengthened his position more by alliances with his neighbors than by wars (of which there were only two or three during his reign). He avoided difficulties with the more powerful rulers, in the case of Tezozómoc, by paying the demanded tribute. Tezozómoc asked for a chinampa cultivated with beautiful flowers, and the Aztecs formed one, raised the flowers, and floated the chinampa to him over the lake.

===Heirs and succession===
Acamapichtli&#x27;s first wife bore him no children, so he took another wife, Tezcatlan Miyahuatzin, a daughter of Acacitli. She was the mother of Huitzilíhuitl, who succeeded to the throne after the death of his father. Another son of Acamapichtli, Itzcóatl, also became &quot;tlatoani&quot; in 1427. He was the son of a slave Acamapichtli had bought in the market of Azcapotzalco. She was of noble birth, but had been captured and enslaved. Although &quot;tlatoani&quot; was not strictly a hereditary title, candidates were clearly restricted to a small class of princes, and all later Aztec rulers descended from Acamapichtli.

Before his death, Acamapichtili called together the chiefs of the four neighborhoods into which he had divided the city, and asked them to elect his successor. Before the death of Acamapichtili, they chose his eldest son Huitzilíhuitl. Acamapichtili approved the election, and then died. After the death of his father, Huitzilíhuitl consolidated his power by ordering a new election, with more electors, including important warriors and priests.

==Personal life==
Among his wives were Ilancueitl, Tezcatlan Miyahuatzin, Huitzilxotzin, and Xiuhcuetzin.

<doc id="453420" wikidata="Q1341528" url="?curid=453420" title="Directed-energy weapon">
<text>A directed-energy weapon (DEW) is a ranged weapon that damages its target with highly focused energy without a solid projectile, including lasers, microwaves, particle beams, and sound beams. Potential applications of this technology include weapons that target personnel, missiles, vehicles, and optical devices.

In the United States, the Pentagon, DARPA, the Air Force Research Laboratory, United States Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center, and the Naval Research Laboratory are researching directed-energy weapons to counter ballistic missiles, hypersonic cruise missiles, and hypersonic glide vehicles. These systems of missile defense are expected to come online no sooner than the mid to late-2020s.

China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, India, Israel, and Pakistan are also developing military-grade directed-energy weapons, while Iran and Turkey claim to have them in active service. The first use of directed-energy weapons in combat between military forces was claimed to have occurred in Libya in August 2019 by Turkey, which claimed to use the ALKA directed-energy weapon. After decades of research and development, most directed-energy weapons are still at the experimental stage and it remains to be seen if or when they will be deployed as practical, high-performance military weapons.

==Operational advantages==
Directed energy weapons could have several main advantages over conventional weaponry:
* Directed-energy weapons can be used discreetly; radiation does not generate sound and is invisible if outside the visible spectrum.
* Light is, for practical purposes, unaffected by gravity, windage and Coriolis force, giving it an almost perfectly flat trajectory. This makes aim much more precise and extends the range to line-of-sight, limited only by beam diffraction and spread (which dilute the power and weaken the effect), and absorption or scattering by intervening atmospheric contents.
* Lasers travel at light-speed and have long range, making them suitable for use in space warfare.
* Laser weapons potentially eliminate many logistical problems in terms of ammunition supply, as long as there is enough energy to power them.
* Depending on several operational factors, directed-energy weapons may be cheaper to operate than conventional weapons in certain contexts.
* Use of high-powered microwave weapons, which are typically used to degrade and damage electronics such as drones, can be hard to attribute to a particular actor.

==Types==
=== Microwave ===
Some devices are described as microwave weapons; the microwave frequency is commonly defined as being between 300 MHz and 300 GHz (wavelengths of 1 meter to 1 millimeter), which is within the radiofrequency (RF) range. Some examples of weapons which have been publicized by the military are as follows:

====Active Denial System====
Active Denial System is a millimeter wave source that heats the water in a human target&#x27;s skin and thus causes incapacitating pain. It was developed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and Raytheon for riot-control duty. Though intended to cause severe pain while leaving no lasting damage, concern has been voiced as to whether the system could cause irreversible damage to the eyes. There has yet to be testing for long-term side effects of exposure to the microwave beam. It can also destroy unshielded electronics.

====Vigilant Eagle====
Vigilant Eagle is a ground-based airport defense system that directs high-frequency microwaves towards any projectile that is fired at an aircraft. It was announced by Raytheon in 2005, and the effectiveness of its waveforms was reported to have been demonstrated in field tests to be highly effective in defeating MANPADS missiles.

The system consists of a missile-detecting and tracking subsystem (MDT), a command and control system, and a scanning array. The MDT is a fixed grid of passive infrared (IR) cameras. The command and control system determines the missile launch point. The scanning array projects microwaves that disrupt the surface-to-air missile&#x27;s guidance system, deflecting it from the aircraft. Vigilant Eagle was not mentioned on Raytheon&#x27;s Web site in 2022.

====Bofors HPM Blackout====
Bofors HPM Blackout is a high-powered microwave weapon that is said to be able to destroy at short distance a wide variety of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic equipment and is purportedly non-lethal.

====EL/M-2080 Green Pine|EL/M-2080 Green P====
The effective radiated power (ERP) of the EL/M-2080 Green Pine radar makes it a hypothetical candidate for conversion into a directed-energy weapon, by focusing pulses of radar energy on target missiles. The energy spikes are tailored to enter missiles through antennas or sensor apertures where they can fool guidance systems, scramble computer memories or even burn out sensitive electronic components.

====Active electronically scanned array====
AESA radars mounted on fighter aircraft have been slated as directed energy weapons against missiles, however, a senior US Air Force officer noted: &quot;they aren&#x27;t particularly suited to create weapons effects on missiles because of limited antenna size, power and field of view&quot;. Potentially lethal effects are produced only inside 100 meters range, and disruptive effects at distances on the order of one kilometer. Moreover, cheap countermeasures can be applied to existing missiles.

====Anti-drone rifle====

A weapon often described as an &quot;anti-drone rifle&quot; or &quot;anti-drone gun&quot; is a battery-powered electromagnetic pulse weapon held to an operator&#x27;s shoulder, pointed at a flying target in a way similar to a rifle, and operated. While not a rifle or gun, it is so nicknamed as it is handled in the same way as a personal rifle. The device emits separate electromagnetic pulses to suppress navigation and transmission channels used to operate an aerial drone, terminating the drone&#x27;s contact with its operator; the out-of-control drone then crashes.
The Russian &quot;Stupor&quot; is reported to have a range of two kilometers, covering a 20-degree sector; it also suppresses the drone&#x27;s cameras. &quot;Stupor&quot; is reported to have been used by Russian forces during the Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war.

Both Russia and Ukraine are reported to use these devices during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian army are reported to use the Ukrainian KVS G-6, with a 3.5 km range and able to operate continuously for 30 minutes. The manufacturer states that the weapon can disrupt remote control, the transmission of video at 2.4 and 5 GHz, and GPS and Glonass satellite navigation signals. Ukraine has also used the EDM4S anti drone rifle to shoot down Russian Eleron-3 drones.

Due to the threat posed by drones in regard to terrorism, several police forces have carried anti-drone guns as part of their equipment. For example, during the policing of the Commonwealth Games in 2018, the Australian Queensland Police Service carried anti-drone guns with an effective range of . In Myanmar, police have been equipped with anti-drone guns &quot;ostensibly to defend VIPs&quot;.

====Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project====
==== THOR/Mjolnir ====
====Radio Frequency Directed Energy Weapon (RFDEW)====

This UK-developed system was unveiled in May 2024 and uses radio waves to fry the electronic components of its targets, rendering them inoperable. It is capable of engaging multiple targets, including drone swarms, and reportedly costs less than 10 pence (13 cents) per shot, making it a cheaper alternative to traditional missile-based air defense systems.

=== Laser ===

A laser weapon is a directed-energy weapon based on lasers.

====DragonFire====

An example of a laser directed-energy weapon is the DragonFire currently being developed by the United Kingdom. It is reportedly in the 50 kW class and is capable of engaging any target within line-of-sight at a currently classified range. It has been tested against drones and mortar rounds and is expected to equip ships, aircraft and ground vehicles from 2027.

=== Particle-beam ===

Particle-beam weapons can use charged or neutral particles, and can be either endoatmospheric or exoatmospheric. Particle beams as beam weapons are theoretically possible, but practical weapons have not been demonstrated yet. Certain types of particle beams have the advantage of being self-focusing in the atmosphere.

Blooming is also a problem in particle-beam weapons. Energy that would otherwise be focused on the target spreads out and the beam becomes less effective:
* Thermal blooming occurs in both charged and neutral particle beams, and occurs when particles bump into one another under the effects of thermal vibration, or bump into air molecules.
* Electrical blooming occurs only in charged particle beams, as ions of like charge repel one another.

=== Plasma ===
Plasma weapons fire a beam, bolt, or stream of plasma, which is an excited state of matter consisting of atomic electrons and nuclei, and free electrons if ionized, or other particles if pinched.

The MARAUDER (&quot;Magnetically Accelerated Ring to Achieve Ultra-high Directed-Energy and Radiation&quot;) used the Shiva Star project (a high energy capacitor bank which provided the means to test weapons and other devices requiring brief and extremely large amounts of energy) to accelerate a toroid of plasma at a significant percentage of the speed of light.

The Russian Federation claims to be developing various plasma weapons.

=== Sonic ===
==== Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) ====
The Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) is an acoustic hailing device developed by Genasys (formerly LRAD Corporation) to send messages and warning tones over longer distances or at higher volume than normal loudspeakers, and as a non-lethal directed-acoustic-energy weapon. LRAD systems are used for long-range communications in a variety of applications and as a means of non-lethal, non-projectile crowd control. They are also used on ships as an anti-piracy measure.

According to the manufacturer&#x27;s specifications, the systems weigh from and can emit sound in a 30°- 60° beam at 2.5 kHz. They range in size from small, portable handheld units which can be strapped to a person&#x27;s chest, to larger models which require a mount. The power of the sound beam which LRADs produce is sufficient to penetrate vehicles and buildings while retaining a high degree of fidelity, so that verbal messages can be conveyed clearly in some situations.

== History ==

=== Ancient ===

==== Mirrors of Archimedes ====
According to a legend, Archimedes created a mirror with an adjustable focal length (or more likely, a series of mirrors focused on a common point) to focus sunlight on ships of the Roman fleet as they invaded Syracuse, setting them on fire. Historians point out that the earliest accounts of the battle did not mention a &quot;burning mirror&quot;, but merely stated that Archimedes&#x27;s ingenuity combined with a way to hurl fire were relevant to the victory. Some attempts to replicate this feat have had some success; in particular, an experiment by students at MIT showed that a mirror-based weapon was at least possible, if not necessarily practical. The hosts of &quot;MythBusters&quot; tackled the Mirrors of Archimedes three times (in episodes 19, 57 and 172) and were never able to make the target ship catch fire, declaring the myth busted three separate times.

===20th Century===
==== Robert Watson-Watt ====
In 1935, the British Air Ministry asked Robert Watson-Watt of the Radio Research Station (UK) whether a &quot;death ray&quot; was possible. He and colleague Arnold Wilkins quickly concluded that it was not feasible, but as a consequence suggested using radio for the detection of aircraft and this started the development of radar in Britain.

==== The fictional &quot;engine-stopping ray&quot; ====
Stories in the 1930s and World War II gave rise to the idea of an &quot;engine-stopping ray&quot;. They seemed to have arisen from the testing of the television transmitter in Feldberg, Germany. Because electrical noise from car engines would interfere with field strength measurements, sentries would stop all traffic in the vicinity for the twenty minutes or so needed for a test. Reversing the order of events in retelling the story created a &quot;tale&quot; where tourists car engine stopped first and then were approached by a German soldier who told them that they had to wait. The soldier returned a short time later to say that the engine would now work and the tourists drove off. Such stories were circulating in Britain around 1938 and during the war British Intelligence relaunched the myth as a &quot;British engine-stopping ray,&quot; trying to spoof the Germans into researching what the British had supposedly invented in an attempt to tie up German scientific resources.

==== German World War II experimental weapons ====

During the early 1940s Axis engineers developed a sonic cannon that could cause fatal vibrations in its target body. A methane gas combustion chamber leading to two parabolic dishes pulse-detonated at roughly 44 Hz. This sound, magnified by the dish reflectors, caused vertigo and nausea at by vibrating the middle ear bones and shaking the cochlear fluid within the inner ear. At distances of , the sound waves could act on organ tissues and fluids by repeatedly compressing and releasing compressive resistant organs such as the kidneys, spleen, and liver. (It had little detectable effect on malleable organs such as the heart, stomach and intestines.) Lung tissue was affected at only the closest ranges as atmospheric air is highly compressible and only the blood rich alveoli resist compression. In practice, the weapon was highly vulnerable to enemy fire. Rifle, bazooka and mortar rounds easily deformed the parabolic reflectors, rendering the wave amplification ineffective.

In the later phases of World War II, Nazi Germany increasingly put its hopes on research into technologically revolutionary secret weapons, the &quot;Wunderwaffe&quot;.

Among the directed-energy weapons the Nazis investigated were X-ray beam weapons developed under Heinz Schmellenmeier, Richard Gans and Fritz Houtermans. They built an electron accelerator called Rheotron to generate hard X-ray synchrotron beams for the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM). Invented by Max Steenbeck at Siemens-Schuckert in the 1930s, these were later called Betatrons by the Americans. The intent was to pre-ionize ignition in aircraft engines and hence serve as anti-aircraft DEW and bring planes down into the reach of the flak. The Rheotron was captured by the Americans in Burggrub on April 14, 1945.

Another approach was Ernst Schiebolds &#x27;Röntgenkanone&#x27; developed from 1943 in Großostheim near Aschaffenburg. Richert Seifert &amp; Co from Hamburg delivered parts.

====Reported use in Sino-Soviet conflicts====
The Central Intelligence Agency informed Secretary Henry Kissinger that it had twelve reports of Soviet forces using laser weapons against Chinese forces during the 1969 Sino-Soviet border clashes, though William Colby doubted that they had actually been employed.

==== Northern Ireland &quot;squawk box&quot; field trials ====
In 1973, &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine reported that a sonic weapon known as a &quot;squawk box&quot; underwent successful field trials in Northern Ireland, using soldiers as guinea pigs. The device combined two slightly different frequencies which when heard would be heard as the sum of the two frequencies (ultrasonic) and the difference between the two frequencies (infrasonic) e.g. two directional speakers emitting 16,000 Hz and 16,002 Hz frequencies would produce in the ear two frequencies of 32,002 Hz and 2 Hz. The article states: &quot;The squawk box is highly directional which gives it its appeal. Its effective beam width is so small that it can be directed at individuals in a riot. Other members of a crowd are unaffected, except by panic when they see people fainting, being sick, or running from the scene with their hands over their ears. The virtual inaudibility of the equipment is said to produce a &#x27;spooky&#x27; psychological effect.&quot; The UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence denied the existence of such a device. It stated that it did have, however, an &quot;ultra-loud public address system which [...] could be &#x27;used for verbal communication over two miles, or put out a sustained or modulated sound blanket to make conversation, and thus crowd organisation, impossible.&#x27;&quot;

==== East German &quot;decomposition&quot; methods ====

In East Germany in the 1960s, in an effort to avoid international condemnation for arresting and interrogating people for holding politically incorrect views or for performing actions deemed hostile by the state the state security service, the Stasi, attempted alternative methods of repression which could paralyze people without imprisoning them. One such alternative method was called decomposition (transl. Zersetzung). In the 1970s and 1980s it became the primary method of repressing domestic &quot;hostile-negative&quot; forces.

Some of the victims of this method suffered from cancer and claimed that they had also been targeted with directed X-rays. In addition, when the East German state collapsed, powerful X-ray equipment was found in prisons without there being any apparent reason to justify its presence. In 1999, the modern German state was investigating the possibility that this X-ray equipment was being used as weaponry and that it was a deliberate policy of the Stasi to attempt to give prisoners radiation poisoning, and thereby cancer, through the use of directed X-rays.

The negative effects of the radiation poisoning and cancer would extend past the period of incarceration. In this manner someone could be debilitated even though they were no longer imprisoned. The historian Mary Fulbrook states, 

==== Strategic Defense Initiative ====
In the 1980s, U.S. President Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program, which was nicknamed &quot;Star Wars&quot;. It suggested that lasers, perhaps space-based X-ray lasers, could destroy ICBMs in flight. Panel discussions on the role of high-power lasers in SDI took place at various laser conferences, during the 1980s, with the participation of noted physicists including Edward Teller.

A notable example of a directed energy system which came out of the SDI program is the Neutral Particle Beam Accelerator developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory. This system is officially described (on the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum website) as a low power neutral particle beam (NPB) accelerator, which was among several directed energy weapons examined by the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization for potential use in missile defense. In July 1989, the accelerator was launched from White Sands Missile Range as part of the Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket (BEAR) project, reaching an altitude of 200 kilometers (124 miles) and operating successfully in space before being recovered intact after reentry. The primary objectives of the test were to assess NPB propagation characteristics in space and gauge the effects on spacecraft components. Despite continued research into NPBs, no known weapon system utilizing this technology has been deployed.

Though the strategic missile defense concept has continued to the present under the Missile Defense Agency, most of the directed-energy weapon concepts were shelved. However, Boeing has been somewhat successful with the Boeing YAL-1 and Boeing NC-135, the first of which destroyed two missiles in February 2010. Funding has been cut to both of the programs.

==== Iraq War ====

During the Iraq War, electromagnetic weapons, including high power microwaves, were used by the U.S. military to disrupt and destroy Iraqi electronic systems and may have been used for crowd control. Types and magnitudes of exposure to electromagnetic fields are unknown.

====Alleged tracking of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;====
The Soviet Union invested some effort in the development of ruby and carbon dioxide lasers as anti-ballistic missile systems, and later as a tracking and anti-satellite system. There are reports that the Terra-3 complex at Sary Shagan was used on several occasions to temporarily &quot;blind&quot; US spy satellites in the IR range.

It has been claimed that the USSR made use of the lasers at the Terra-3 site to target the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1984. At the time, the Soviet Union was concerned that the shuttle was being used as a reconnaissance platform. On 10 October 1984 (STS-41-G), the Terra-3 tracking laser was allegedly aimed at &quot;Challenger&quot; as it passed over the facility. Early reports claimed that this was responsible for causing &quot;malfunctions on the space shuttle and distress to the crew&quot;, and that the United States filed a diplomatic protest about the incident. However, this story is comprehensively denied by the crew members of STS-41-G and knowledgeable members of the US intelligence community. After the end of the Cold War, the Terra-3 facility was found to be a low-power laser testing site with limited satellite tracking capabilities, which is now abandoned and partially disassembled.

===Havana syndrome===

Havana syndrome is a disputed medical condition reported by US personnel in Havana, Cuba and other locations, originally suspected to be caused by microwave radiation. In January 2022, the Central Intelligence Agency issued an interim assessment concluding that the syndrome is not the result of &quot;a sustained global campaign by a hostile power.&quot; Foreign involvement was ruled out in 976 cases of the 1,000 reviewed. In February 2022, the State Department released a report by the JASON Advisory Group, which stated that it was highly unlikely that a directed-energy attack had caused the health incidents. The cause of Havana syndrome remains unknown and controversial.

===Anti-piracy measures===
LRADs are often fitted on commercial and military ships. They have been used on several occasions to repel pirate attacks by sending warnings and by producing intolerable levels of sound. For example, in 2005 the cruise liner &quot;Seabourn Spirit&quot; used a sonic weapon to defend itself from Somali pirates in the Indian ocean. A few years later, the cruise liner &quot;Spirit of Adventure&quot; also defended itself from Somali pirates by using its LRAD to force them to retreat.

== Non-lethal weapon capability==
The TECOM Technology Symposium in 1997 concluded on non-lethal weapons, &quot;determining the target effects on personnel is the greatest challenge to the testing community&quot;, primarily because &quot;the potential of injury and death severely limits human tests&quot;.

Also, &quot;directed-energy weapons that target the central nervous system and cause neurophysiological disorders may violate the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention of 1980. Weapons that go beyond non-lethal intentions and cause &#x27;superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering&#x27; may also violate the Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1977.&quot;

Some common bio-effects of non-lethal electromagnetic weapons include:
* Difficulty breathing
* Disorientation
* Nausea
* Pain
* Vertigo
* Other systemic discomfort
Interference with breathing poses the most significant, potentially lethal results.

Light and repetitive visual signals can induce epileptic seizures. Vection and motion sickness can also occur.

Russia has reportedly been using blinding laser weapons during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

<text>Not safe for work (NSFW) is Internet slang or shorthand used to mark links to content, videos, or website pages the viewer may not wish to be seen viewing in a public, formal, or controlled environment. The marked content may contain graphic violence, pornography, profanity, nudity, slurs, or other potentially disturbing subject matter. Environments that may be problematic include workplaces, schools, and family settings. NSFW has particular relevance for people trying to make personal use of the Internet at workplaces or schools that have policies prohibiting access to sexual and graphic subject matter. Conversely, safe for work (SFW) is used for links that do not contain such material, especially where the title might otherwise lead people to think that the content is NSFW.

The similar expression not safe for life (NSFL) is also used, referring to content which is so nauseating or disturbing that it might be emotionally scarring to view. Links marked NSFL may contain fetish pornography, gore, or murder. 

Some websites, such as Reddit and OnlyFans, give users the option to designate their content as NSFW in order to warn others of its inappropriate nature.

<doc id="453427" wikidata="Q2125331" url="?curid=453427" title="Racter">
<text>Racter is an artificial intelligence program that generates English language prose at random. It was published by Mindscape for IBM PC compatibles in 1984, then for the Apple II, Mac, and Amiga. An expanded version of the software, not the one released through Mindscape, was used to generate the text for the published book &quot;The Policeman&#x27;s Beard Is Half Constructed&quot;.

==History==
Racter, short for &quot;raconteur&quot;, was written by William Chamberlain and Thomas Etter. Racter&#x27;s initial creation was the short story &quot;Soft Ions&quot;, which appeared in the October 1981 issue of Omni (magazine). The publication&#x27;s editors bought the story in January 1980, before it had even been written. In exchange for the rights, the editors offered financial support to Chamberlain and Etter so the two could refine Racter. In 1983, Racter produced a book called &quot;The Policeman&#x27;s Beard Is Half Constructed&quot; ().

The program originally was written for an OSI which only supported file names at most six characters long, causing the name to be shorted to Racter and it was later adapted to run on a CP/M machine where it was written in &quot;compiled ASIC on a Z80 microcomputer with 64K of RAM.&quot; This version, the program that allegedly wrote the book, was not released to the general public. The sophistication claimed for the program was likely exaggerated, as could be seen by investigation of the template system of text generation.

In 1984, Mindscape released an interactive version of Racter, developed by Inrac Corporation, for IBM PC compatibles, and it was ported to the Apple II, Mac, and Amiga. The published Racter was similar to a chatterbot. The BASIC program that was released by Mindscape was far less sophisticated than anything that could have written the fairly sophisticated prose of &quot;The Policeman&#x27;s Beard&quot;. The commercial version of Racter could be likened to a computerized version of &quot;Mad Libs&quot;, the game in which you fill in the blanks in advance and then plug them into a text template to produce a surrealistic tale. The commercial program attempted to parse text inputs, identifying significant nouns and verbs, which it would then regurgitate to create &quot;conversations&quot;, plugging the input from the user into phrase templates which it then combined, along with modules that conjugated English verbs.

By contrast, the text in &quot;The Policeman&#x27;s Beard&quot;, apart from being edited from a large amount of output, would have been the product of Chamberlain&#x27;s own specialized templates and modules, which were not included in the commercial release of the program.

==Reception==
&quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; called the story &quot;Soft Ions&quot; &quot;schematic nonsense. But the scheme is obvious enough and the nonsense accessible enough to an attentive reader that one can almost believe Chamberlain when he predicts that before long Racter will be ready to write for the pulp-reading public.&quot;

&quot;PC Magazine&quot; described some of &quot;Policeman&#x27;s Beard&quot;″s scenes as &quot;surprising for their frankness&quot; and &quot;reflective&quot;. It concluded that the book was &quot;whimsical and wise and sometimes fun&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described &quot;Racter&quot; as &quot;a diversion into another dimension that might best be seen before paying the price of a ticket. (Try before you buy!)&quot;

A 1985 review of the program in &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes that, &quot;As computers move ever closer to artificial intelligence, Racter is on the edge of artificial insanity.&quot; It also states that Racter&#x27;s &quot;always-changing sentences are grammatically correct, often funny and, for a computer, sometimes profound.&quot; The article includes examples showing interaction with Racter, most often Racter asking the user questions.

<doc id="453433" wikidata="Q774278" url="?curid=453433" title="Scallion">
<text>Scallions (also known as green onions and spring onions) are edible vegetables of various species in the genus &quot;Allium&quot;. Scallions generally have a milder taste than most onions. Their close relatives include garlic, shallots, leeks, chives, and Chinese onions. The leaves are eaten both raw and cooked. 

Scallions produce hollow, tubular, green leaves that grow directly from the bulb, which does not fully develop. This is different to other &quot;Allium&quot; species where bulbs fully develop, such as commercially available onions and garlic. With scallions, the leaves are what is typically chopped into various dishes and used as garnishes. 

== Etymology and naming==
The names &quot;scallion&quot; and &quot;shallot&quot; derive from the Old French &quot;eschalotte&quot;, by way of &quot;eschaloigne&quot;, from the Latin &quot;Ascalōnia caepa&quot; or &quot;Ascalonian onion&quot;, a namesake of the ancient Eastern Mediterranean coastal city of Ascalon.

Other names used in various parts of the world include spring onion, green onion, table onion, salad onion, onion stick, long onion, baby onion, precious onion, wild onion, yard onion, gibbon, syboe (Scots), and shallot.

==Varieties==

Species and cultivars that may be used as scallions include
* &quot;A. cepa&quot;
** &#x27;White Lisbon&#x27;
** &#x27;White Lisbon Winter Hardy&#x27; – an extra-hardy variety for overwintering
** Calçot
** &quot;A. cepa&quot; var. &quot;cepa&quot; – Most of the cultivars grown in the West as scallions belong to this variety. The scallions from &quot;A. cepa&quot; var. &quot;cepa&quot; (common onion) are usually from a young plant, harvested before a bulb forms or sometimes soon after slight bulbing has occurred.
** &quot;A. cepa&quot; var. &quot;aggregatum&quot; (formerly &quot;A. ascalonicum&quot;) – commonly called shallots or sometimes &quot;eschalot&quot;.
* &quot;A. chinense&quot;
* &quot;A. fistulosum&quot;, the Welsh onion – does not form bulbs even when mature, and is grown in the West almost exclusively as a scallion or salad onion. 
* &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;proliferum&quot; – sometimes used as scallions

== Germination ==
Scallions generally take 7–14 days to germinate depending on the variety.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===

Scallions may be cooked or used raw, often as a part of salads, salsas, or as a garnish. Scallion oil is sometimes made from the green leaves, after they are chopped, lightly cooked, and emulsified in a vegetable oil.

In Catalan cuisine, &quot;calçot&quot; is a type of onion traditionally eaten in a &quot;calçotada&quot; (plural: &quot;calçotades&quot;). An eponymous gastronomic event is traditionally held between the end of winter and early spring, where &quot;calçots&quot; are grilled, dipped in &quot;salvitxada&quot; or romesco sauce, and consumed in massive quantities.

In Ireland, scallions are chopped and added to mashed potatoes, known as champ or as an added ingredient to Colcannon.

In Mexico and the Southwest United States, &quot;cebollitas&quot; () are scallions that are sprinkled with salt, grilled whole, and eaten with lime juice, cheese and rice. They are typically served as a traditional accompaniment to &quot;asado&quot; dishes.
At the Passover meal (Seder), Afghan Jews and Persian Jews strike one another with scallions before singing &quot;Dayenu&quot;, thus re-enacting the whipping endured by the Hebrews enslaved by the ancient Egyptians. 

In Asian cuisine, diced scallions are often used in soup, noodle, and seafood dishes, sandwiches, curries, and as part of a stir fry. The bottom half-centimetre of the root is commonly removed before use.

In China, scallion is commonly used together with ginger and garlic to cook a wide variety of vegetables and meat. This combination is often called the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of Chinese cooking, much like the mirepoix (celery, onions, and carrots) in French cuisine or the holy trinity in Cajun cuisine. The white part of scallion is usually fried with other ingredients while the green part is usually chopped to decorate finished food.

In India, it is sometimes eaten raw as an appetizer. In north India, coriander, mint and onion chutney are made using uncooked scallions. It is also used as a vegetable with Chapatis and Rotis. In south India, spring onions stir fried with coconut and shallots (known as &quot;Vengaya Thazhai Poriyal&quot; in Tamil and &quot;Ulli Thandu Upperi&quot; in Malayalam) are served as a side dish with rice.

In Japan, tree onions (&quot;wakegi&quot;) are used mostly as topping of Japanese cuisine such as tofu. 
In Nepal, scallion is used in different meat dish fillings like momo and choyla (meat intertwined with scallion and spices).

In the southern Philippines, it is ground in a mortar along with ginger and chili pepper to make a native condiment called wet &quot;palapa&quot;, which can be used to spice dishes or as a topping for fried or sun-dried food. It can also be used to make the dry version of &quot;palapa&quot;, when it is stir fried with fresh coconut shavings and wet palapa.

In Vietnam, Welsh onion is important to prepare &quot;dưa hành&quot; (fermented onions) which is served for Tết, the Vietnamese New Year. A kind of sauce, &quot;mỡ hành&quot; (Welsh onion fried in oil), is used in dishes such as &quot;cơm tấm&quot;, &quot;bánh ít&quot; and &quot;cà tím nướng&quot;. Welsh onion is the main ingredient in the dish &quot;cháo hành&quot;, which is a rice porridge used to treat the common cold.

<text>OpenAFS is an open-source implementation of the Andrew distributed file system (AFS). AFS was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, and developed as a commercial product by the Transarc Corporation, which was subsequently acquired by IBM. At &quot;LinuxWorld&quot; on 15 August 2000, IBM announced their plans to release a version of their commercial AFS product under the IBM Public License. This became OpenAFS. Today, OpenAFS is actively developed for a wide range of operating system families including: AIX, Mac OS X, Darwin, HP-UX, Irix, Solaris, Linux, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, NetBSD.

== Foundation ==
The OpenAFS Foundation was established on May 20, 2013 as a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the stability and growth of OpenAFS.

==Governance==
Governance of the project is split between the board of elders who consider issues of strategic direction, and the gatekeepers who control the source repository.

==Licensing==
Although there is no legal entity that owns the OpenAFS source code, copyright on many files is attributed to IBM. Most of the source is covered by the IPL, however several files in the tree are covered by university vanity licenses. All applicable licenses are listed in a file in the source repository called openafs/doc/LICENSE.

==Development==
The contributors over the last five years have made significant improvements to both the implementation and the AFS3 protocol without breaking interoperability with the IBM/Transarc releases. Since that announcement was written, several large development projects have been integrated, such as: 64-bit MS-Windows support, MS-Windows 7 support, Apple-Mac OS X v10.4-v10.9 support, and the demand attach fileserver.

Many development projects are at various stages of completion. The following are several prominent examples:

* Fileserver back-end utilizing object storage
* rxtcp
* rxgk
* rxk5
* Instrumentation framework
* Byte-range locking support

==Deployment==
The existing user base includes small single server cells as well as large multinational deployments spanning academia, private research laboratories, government, and commercial entities. A small snapshot of the deployed AFS cells can be found by reviewing the contents of the CellServDB file distributed with OpenAFS.

In 1989, he had a recurring role on the television series &quot;Wiseguy&quot;.
As for major motion pictures, he has appeared in films including &quot;The Goonies&quot;, where his role of Jake Fratelli was based upon Davi’s own artistic ideas differing from the original script.

Rather, he is his own singer.&quot; The album reached the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz charts.

<text>Royston Campbell Crane (November 22, 1901 – July 7, 1977), who signed his work Roy Crane, was an American cartoonist who created the comic strip characters Wash Tubbs, Captain Easy and Buz Sawyer. He pioneered the adventure comic strip, establishing the conventions and artistic approach of that genre. Comics historian R. C. Harvey wrote, &quot;Many of those who drew the earliest adventure strips were inspired and influenced by his work.&quot;

== Biography ==
Born in Abilene, Texas, Crane grew up in nearby Sweetwater. When he was 14, he took the Charles N. Landon correspondence course in cartooning. He initially attended college at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene and later the University of Texas, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. At 19, he studied for six months at the Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago. His early work history was a checkered one, including pitching tents for a Chautauqua, a seaman&#x27;s berth and a stint riding the rails. In 1922, he began his newspaper cartooning career on the &quot;New York World&quot;, where he assisted H. T. Webster. Crane was also influenced by the work of cartoonist Ethel Hays, especially in the drawing of women.

===Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy===
In 1924, Crane approached Charles N. Landon, an editor at the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Landon and Crane discussed a strip titled &quot;Washington Tubbs II&quot; about a diminutive goof employed at a grocery store. With the title shortened to &quot;Wash Tubbs&quot;, the strip debuted April 14, 1924. After four months, Crane tired of the gag-a-day format and sent his pint-size hero hunting for a treasure buried somewhere on a South Pacific island. The strip then evolved into a rollicking adventure yarn, with Crane introducing innovations in storytelling, sound effects and layouts, as noted by pop culture historian Tim DeForest:
:Though played mostly for laughs, the storyline contained a notable element of danger as well... Crane was developing strength as an artist that added to his already strong figure work. He had an eye for detail, paying close attention to background and to the overall layout of each panel. He was an innovator in the use of lettering, using bold type and exclamation points to enhance the emotions already expressed by his character design... It was Crane who pioneered the use of onomatopoeic sound effects in comics, adding &quot;bam,&quot; &quot;pow&quot; and &quot;wham&quot; to what had previously been an almost entirely visual vocabulary. Crane had fun with this, tossing in an occasional &quot;ker-splash&quot; or &quot;lickety-wop&quot; along with what would become the more standard effects. Words as well as images became vehicles for carrying along his increasingly fast-paced storylines. Following Wash&#x27;s initial adventure, the strip reverted to a dependence on gags for a time. But Wash had acquired a taste for travel and adventure.

With the introduction in 1929 of the raffish soldier of fortune, Captain Easy, Crane heightened the spirit of adventure and later created a Sunday strip focusing on Captain Easy. NBM Publishing&#x27;s Flying Buttress Classics Library reprinted the complete run of &quot;Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy&quot; in a series of 18 volumes. Bill Blackbeard&#x27;s introductions to these books contain biographical and critical material.

===Buz Sawyer===
World War II rendered the comic-opera settings of Tubbs&#x27; adventures frivolous, and the strip took on a new tone. In 1943, an offer from Hearst&#x27;s King Features Syndicate persuaded Crane to jump ship and create a more realistic comic strip, &quot;Buz Sawyer&quot;. He left &quot;Wash Tubbs&quot; in the hands of his assistant, Leslie Turner, a boyhood friend who had shared the hobo life with him.

Crane, an excellent draftsman despite his deceptively cartoonish style, introduced more illustrative shading techniques to the daily comics page. He progressed from line drawings with crosshatching to grease pencil on textured paper, then to Benday Dots and finally to Craftint Doubletone Paper. The Craftint paper, when brushed with chemical solutions, revealed either one or two layers of diagonal shading. Under Crane&#x27;s brush, the technique yielded scenes of dramatic atmosphere, such as junglescapes fading into the misty distance. As he had done with &quot;Wash Tubbs&quot;, Crane traveled to various locations to research his plot lines and visuals. According to Crane: &quot;In using benday, at first I thought in terms of blacks, grays, and white. Years of indifferent results and frustration followed. Gradually, black became less important. Today white is not just something to bring out the color of black... on the contrary, black is something to bring out the color of white&quot;.

Crane progressively relinquished his cartooning to assistants, and he died in Orlando, Florida in 1977.

Today, &quot;Buz Sawyer&quot; has been resurrected digitally as one of the vintage strips in King Features&#x27; emailed DailyINK subscription service.

According to comics historian Jeet Heer, Crane had a relationship with the State Department and the Navy Department and used the &quot;Buz Sawyer&quot; strip for propaganda purposes in order to support American foreign policy aims during World War II, the Cold War as well as the Vietnam War.

==Awards==
Crane was awarded the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Billy DeBeck Memorial Award, later renamed the Reuben Award, for Cartoonist of the Year in 1950, and their Story Comic Strip Award in 1965, both for &quot;Buz Sawyer&quot;. In 1961 he was awarded the Silver Lady by the New York Banshee Society. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Texas at Austin in 1969.

In 1965, he established the Roy Crane Award in the Arts at the University of Texas to encourage excellence and creativity in the arts among undergraduate and graduate students. In 1980, this award was given to Berkeley Breathed.

<text>The Hyundai Motor Group (HMG; ; stylized as HYUNDAI) is a South Korean &quot;chaebol&quot; (loosely similar to a multinational conglomerate but without a central holding company or ownership structure) headquartered in Seoul, South Korea.

The HMG also refers to the group of affiliated companies interconnected by complex shareholding arrangements, with Hyundai Motor Company regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; representative of the group. It is the third-largest South Korean &quot;chaebol&quot;, after Samsung and SK Group, related to other Hyundai-name industries following a specialized development split and restructuring which resulted in Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai Heavy Industries Group, Hyundai Development Company Group, Hyundai Department Store Group, and Hyundai Marine &amp; Fire Insurance.

== History ==
The group was formed through the purchase of 51% of Kia by Hyundai Motor Company in 1998. As of 2011, Hyundai owns 33.7% of Kia Motors.

On 22 May 2022, the Hyundai Motor Group announced the company would invest an additional $5 billion in the United States by the year 2025. The investment would strengthen collaboration with US firms in areas such as; urban air mobility, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, and robotics. The investments were announced during a visit to South Korea by President Biden.

== Businesses ==
The largest member of the &quot;chaebol&quot;, Hyundai Motor Company, has a stake in Kia, and they are the largest and second largest car manufacturers in the country respectively. Following several years of rapid growth, the Group sold 8.01 million vehicles in 2015, falling short of its sales target. In 2017 the Group sold 7.25 million vehicles, the lowest in five years at that point. According to the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d&#x27;Automobiles, it was the world&#x27;s third-largest vehicle manufacturer by production volume in 2017, behind Japanese Toyota and German Volkswagen Group. In 2023, it maintained its No. 3 position in the global market while widening its gap with the fourth-ranked Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance.

On 17 June 2024, Hyundai Motor India announced its commencement of an initial public offering (IPO) process to list on the Mumbai-based Bombay Stock Exchange.

Hyundai Motor Group announced plans to invest a record $16.7 billion in South Korea in 2024, focusing on green technologies and future mobility, marking its largest annual investment commitment.

== Hydrogen ==
Hydrogen Wave global online forum was held on 7 September 2021. Hyundai Motor Group (the Group) set out the vision of the hydrogen business and the substance of hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen mobility. In addition, the Group has set out Hydrogen Vision 2040.

Vision FK, a high-performance hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, was unveiled. Vision FK does not use standard, common vehicle parts and combines Hydrogen Fuel Cell System and PE System developed under collaboration with Limak. Hydrogen Fuel Cell System is utilized as a main power source during FK&#x27;s low speed driving or for the management of battery condition. Two of 2 kg hydrogen fuel tanks are located above the rear axle. Also, the 2nd generation fuel cell stacks, with the power of average 85 kW to maximum 95 kW, are located above the front axle. PE System that consists of two motor drives, decelerator, inverter, and battery, helps to exercise power during the high speed or dynamic driving. The total output of two motor drives applied to the rear-wheel is over 500 kW.

In December 2021, Hyundai suspended development of its Genesis, and possibly its other, hydrogen cars.

<text>Hyundai Glovis Co., Ltd. is a logistics company headquartered in Seoul, South Korea and part of the Hyundai Motor Group. Its predecessor company, Hankook Logitech Co. Ltd was formed in February 2001. Hyundai Glovis supplies ocean transportation logistics advice, cargo space, loading/unloading, and packaging services. It changed its name to Hyundai Glovis in June 2003.

==Company==
The meaning of the name Glovis comes from a portmanteau that combines the two words &quot;Global - Vision&quot;.

Hyundai Glovis main business areas in South Korea and internationally are finished vehicles distribution by Roll-on/roll-off ocean shipping, air transportation, inland truck transportation, logistics consulting, storage, and packaging services, as well as supply chain management services. Since 2011, the company has launched an auto parts recycling business, named &quot;OnECO,&quot; that mainly consists of distribution of reused and remanufactured auto parts.

The company fleet includes 60 Pure Car and Trucks carriers and 36 bulk carrier ships, deployed on 13 different service routes globally,
specialized in the maritime transport and distribution of cargo such as automobiles, trucks, trailers, Mafi roll trailers, heavy construction machinery and further types of rolling freight.

The fleet&#x27;s size largely increased at the end of 2014, when Hyundai Glovis acquired the majority of STX Pan Ocean tonnage.

A joint venture with Stena Line has been announced and approved by the European Commission in February 2019, for the implementation of a new cooperative intra-European waters short sea service in between the two carriers, for the sea transport of transhipment cargo.

==Facts and accidents==
On 1 November 2013, the Port of Le Havre welcomed Glovis&#x27; maiden port stay in France. MV &quot;Glovis Condor&quot; called at the port on her way from Gothenburg to Southampton to load and unload cargo, mainly used trucks and military vehicles destined for the Middle East.

On 23 November 2014, Glovis announced the acquisition of the Polish logistics specialist distributor Adampol. The company owns 611 car carrier trailer trucks, manage 600 loads per day, and has a total staff of over 1,300 employees. The main business is storage, pick up from ports and distribution of new cars within Eastern Europe and Russia, with an average of 400,000 cars delivered per year to the final dealers, for brands such as BMW, General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

On 16 June 2016, the company reaffirmed their intention not to support the Federal government of the United States demands to employ or charter US-flagged vessels. The American Government has suggested on a number of occasions the opportunity to reflag or hiring vessels registered in US, to carry military equipment on Glovis&#x27; ballast leg from US to South Korea. However, due to the costs involved, South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries politely declined.

On 27 December 2016, MV &quot;Glovis Corona&quot; (built in 1996, and formerly known as MV &quot;Asian Grace&quot;) faced a serious near miss, due to severe weather conditions in the European North Sea. The vessel listed approximately 15 degrees, caused by cargo movements in the holds, when cars and high and heavy cargo broke their lashings, dangerously moving within the decks. The accident took place when &quot;Glovis Corona&quot; was sailing from Hamburg to Gothenborg, having to suddenly stop close to Bremerhaven anchorage. On 30 December, a berth was granted at Bremerhaven, to discharge 1,800 cars, and to further ballast to even the keel. Owing to the situation, the export voyage had to be cancelled and the cargo bookings rolled to another sailing.

On 15 February 2018, MV &quot;Glovis Spring&quot; ran aground within the Paracel Islands waters. The vessel was sailing from Singapore to Hong Kong, with over 3,400 brand new European manufactured cars on board, when it ended up in shallow waters, possibly related to the shifting of landfill materials arranged by the Chinese authorities, and aggravated by extreme low tide sea conditions. Two Chinese companies immediately proposed to assist with the maritime salvage promptly sending divers and tugboats. The operation was finally awarded to a joint venture formed by Messrs Ardent and Guangzhou Salvage. MV &quot;Glovis Spring&quot; was successfully refloated and made free 4 days after the grounding.

On Monday, 21 May 2018, MV &quot;Auto Banner&quot;, part of the Glovis tonnage, caught fire while alongside Incheon port, due to overheating of one of the vehicles just loaded on board, destined for Libya. The crew of 28 had to be quickly evacuated from on board, while fire brigades proceeded to successfully extinguish the fire from sea, shore and air. MV &quot;Auto Banner&quot; was built in 1988 and used to be part of STX Pan Ocean fleet. The ship was certified in good condition, according to a recent port state inspection performed in January 2018 in Portland, US.

On 7 September 2019, Greenpeace activists temporary blocked the discharging of Korean SUV vehicles into Bremerhaven port, disrupting for several hours the operations of MV &quot;Glovis Sky&quot;.
On 8 September 2019, , built in 2017 and flying Marshall Islands flag, capsized within Port of Brunswick harbour, shortly after unberthing and proceeding towards Port of Baltimore. Four of the 23 crew members were initially missing, but all were eventually rescued and appeared to be in good medical condition. The incident was mentioned as related to a sudden loss of stability possibly due to cargo stowage and incorrect water ballasting. A Hyundai Glovis executive told the news media that &quot;there was some kind of an internal fire that could not be controlled and then it capsized&quot;. The National Transportation Safety Board agreed to assist in the investigation of the cause of the incident with two investigators assigned to the case.

On 3 November 2019, MV &quot;Glovis Captain&quot; arrived in Southampton after facing extreme weather conditions in the English Channel. The abnormal rolling caused the breaking of several cargo lashings, producing a series of cargo damages on her main deck. A number of brand-new trucks and Porsche cars destined for China, were damaged or nearly completely destroyed after crushing against the ship’s bulkhead. The bulkhead itself suffered a hole that needed urgent repair before the vessel could restart her passage towards Asia. The cargo had to be unloaded by forklift and mafi roll trailers, being no more in driveable conditions. The port stay had to be increased to over 3 days, to perform the necessary inspections, and welding repairs to the ship.

On 28 June 2020, Glovis operated MV &quot;Grand Venus&quot; after completing the discharge of Tesla cars loaded in US at Zeebrugge port, collided with a LNG tanker while both adrift in proximity of Ostend and Zeebrugge outer anchorage area, waiting for assignment. Although the damages occurred were minor, the vessel required repair at Vlissingen dock before starting her consequent voyage towards Asia in July.

On 7 March 2022, the Government Pension Fund of Norway, the world&#x27;s largest sovereign wealth fund, decided to place the company under observation &quot;due to unacceptable risk that the company contributes to gross or systematic human rights violations&quot;.

== Continental rail transport ==
In August 2018, Hyundai Glovis inaugurated its transportation of containers via the Transsiberian Railway, after shipping them via sea to Vladivostok. Hyundai Glovis expects to cut the transit time from 43 days by ship on the southern route around the Eurasian landmass, via the Strait of Malacca, the Suez Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar, to 22 days by rail via Vladivostok. The 22 days are composed of &quot;two days from Busan to Vladivostok; eight days for unloading, customs clearance, and reloading in Vladivostok; and 12 days from Vladivostok to Shushary Station near Saint Petersburg.&quot;

This is seen as a precursor to breaking up the situation of South Korea as an island, having to rely exclusively on transport to and from other countries by sea and air, by re-establishing the rail links to North Korea and thus open direct rail routes to all countries in Europa and nearly all in Asia. South Korean governments since Park Geun-hye have worked towards this goal.

For this purpose, on June 7, 2018, South Korea became an official member of the Organization for Cooperation of Railways (OSJD). &quot;South Korea&#x27;s official membership in the OSJD&quot;, Heo Seung wrote on June 8, 2018, in Hankoryeh, &quot;means it will be able to take part in the operation of 280,000 km of international railway lines in Eurasia, which include the Trans-China Railway (TCR) and Trans-Siberian Railway (TSR). OSJD members are entitled to transport passengers and freight without the need for separate agreements with countries where the railways pass through.&quot;

<text>The M203 is a single-shot 40 mm under-barrel grenade launcher designed to attach to a rifle. It uses the same rounds as the older stand-alone M79 break-action grenade launcher, which utilizes the high-low propulsion system to keep recoil forces low. While compatible with many weapons, the M203 was originally designed and produced by the United States military for the M16 rifle and its carbine variant, the M4. The launcher can also be mounted onto a C7, a Canadian version of the M16 rifle; this requires the prior removal of the bottom handguard. 

Stand-alone variants of the M203 exist, as do versions designed specifically for many other rifles. The device attaches under the barrel, the launcher trigger being in the rear of the launcher, just forward of the rifle magazine. The rifle magazine functions as a hand grip when firing the M203. A separate, right-handed only, sighting system is added to rifles fitted with the M203, as the rifle&#x27;s standard sights are not matched to the launcher. The version fitted to the Canadian C7 has a sight attached to the side of the launcher, either on the left or right depending on the user&#x27;s needs.

==History==
The M203 was the only part of the United States Army&#x27;s Special Purpose Individual Weapon (SPIW) project to go into production. The M203 has been in service since 1969 and was introduced to US military forces during the early 1970s, replacing the M79 grenade launcher and the conceptually similar Colt XM148 design. However, while the M79 was a stand-alone weapon (and usually the primary weapon of troops who carried it), the M203 was designed as an under-barrel device attached to an existing rifle. Because the size and weight of 40 mm ammunition limits the quantities that can be carried, and because a grenade is often not an appropriate weapon for all engagements (such as when the target is at close range or near friendly troops), an under-barrel system has the advantage of allowing its user to also carry a rifle, and to easily switch between the two.

A new grenade launcher, the M320, will eventually replace the M203 in the United States Army. The United States Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy continued to use the older M203, although the Marines began issuing the M320 in June 2017. The M320 features an advanced day/night sight, a double-action firing mechanism (as opposed to the M203&#x27;s single-action) as well as other benefits, such as an unobstructed side-loading breech.

==Uses==
The M203 grenade launcher is intended to be used as close fire support against point and area targets. The round is designed to be effective at breaking through windows and exploding inside, blowing up doors, producing multiple casualties, destroying bunkers or emplacements, and damaging or disabling soft-skinned vehicles. In the Vietnam War, U.S. Navy and Coast Guard personnel on boats would lob 40 mm grenades into the water (using the M79 grenade launcher), to preemptively attack Viet Cong swimmers (&quot;sappers&quot;) attempting to plant explosives on anchored or moored U.S. watercraft.

Its primary purpose is to engage enemies in dead space that cannot be reached by direct fire. A well-trained M203 gunner can use their weapon to suppress the enemy, based on movement and sight. In addition, the M203 can be used as a crowd control weapon when equipped with the M651 tactical CS (tear gas) grenade. While classified primarily as an anti-personnel weapon, the shaped charge featured in the HEDP round gives it the capability to penetrate lightly armored vehicles.

==Rounds==
The M203 is able to fire a variety of different rounds for many purposes. According to the &quot;U.S. Army Field Manual FM 3-22.31 40-MM Grenade Launcher, M203&quot;, there are eight different rounds for the M203:
* (M433) high-explosive dual purpose round. The HEDP round has an olive drab aluminum skirt with a steel cup attached, white markings, and a gold ogive (head of the round). It penetrates at least 5 cm (2 inches) when fired straight at steel armor at or less, or, at a point target, it arms between , causes casualties within a radius, and has a kill radius of 5 meters.
* (M406) high-explosive round. The HE round has an olive drab aluminum skirt with a steel projectile attached, gold markings, and a yellow ogive. It arms between , produces a ground burst that causes casualties within a radius, and has a kill radius of .
* (M583A1) star parachute round. This round is white impact or bar alloy aluminum, with black markings. It is used for illumination and signals and is lighter and more accurate than comparable handheld signal rounds. The parachute attached to the round deploys upon ejection to lower the candle at . The candle burns for about 40 seconds. A raised letter on the top of the round denotes the color of the parachute.
* (M585) white star cluster round. This round is white impact or bar aluminum alloy, with black markings. The attached plastic ogive has five raised dots for night identification. The round is used for illumination or signals. It is lighter and more accurate than comparable handheld signal rounds. The individual stars burn for about 7 seconds during free fall.
* (M713) ground marker round. This round is light green impact aluminum with black markings. It is used for aerial identification and for marking the location of soldiers on the ground. It arms between . If a fuse fails to function on impact, the output mixture provided in the front end of the delay casing backs up the impact feature. The color of the ogive indicates the color of the smoke.
* (M781) practice round. Used for practice, this round is blue zinc or aluminum, with white markings. It produces a yellow or orange signature on impact, arms between , and has a danger radius of .
* (M651) CS round. This round is gray aluminum with a green casing and black markings. Though it is a multipurpose round, it is most effective for riot control and in Urban Operations. It arms between and produces a white cloud of CS gas on impact.
* (M576) buckshot round. This round is olive drab with black markings. Though it is a multipurpose round, it is most effective in thick vegetated areas or for room clearing. Inside, it has 20 metal pellets, each weighing , with a muzzle velocity of . The round has no mechanical-type fuse.

==Components==

The M203 grenade launcher system comes with a variety of components, usually including the launcher, adapters for attachment to assault rifles, and leaf sights (which can be used with the rifle&#x27;s front sight post). M203s can also come with quadrant sights, mounting to an MIL-STD 1913 Rail, or to the carrying handle of an M16 rifle.

The U.S. Marine Corps also uses the SU-277/PSQ Grenade Launcher Sight (GLS), which features a holographic red dot for improved aiming, integrated ballistic data for automatic adjustment based on ammunition, infrared aiming laser, and a compact, lightweight design.

==Variants==

There are numerous variants of the M203 manufactured in the U.S., and throughout the world, for various applications. These vary chiefly in the length of the barrel, attachment type, and quick detach (QD) capability.

The &quot;standard M203&quot; is intended for permanent attachment to the M16A1, M16A2 and M16A3 rifles, and utilizes a rifled barrel. The M203 unmodified to an A1/A2 series will not fit on the M4 carbine series.

The U.S. M203A1 has a barrel of 12 inches, while the SOPMOD M203A1 has a barrel. The M203A1 is intended for use with the M4 and M4A1 carbines, and uses a special bracket mount consisting of three screws and lacing wire. Only M203A2s consist of a quick release bracket.

The Canadian M203A1 by Diemaco (now Colt Canada) is a similar design with a different mounting system that does not require mounting points of the same profile as the M16A1 rifle&#x27;s. The weapon&#x27;s barrel slides further forward than the standard American models, which allows longer rounds to be loaded. This model is identifiable by the increased distance between the grenade launcher&#x27;s barrel axis and the rifle&#x27;s. This weapon may no longer be in production, but is still in use.

The M203A2 is intended for use with the M4 series/M16A4 and now also authorized on the M16A2 rifle as the modular weapon system (MWS). Using standard barrels, the grenade launcher is intended for use in concert with the Knight&#x27;s Armament Company M5 RAS. The M5 MWS rail system became authorized in December 2008 for the M16A2 Rifle. An advantage of this system is the use of range-finding optics to make precise targeting easier.

The M203PI system is used for attachment of the M203 to other rifles, including, but not limited to, the Steyr AUG, Heckler &amp; Koch G3, and the MP5 sub-machine gun. Most of these other companies have since devised 40 mm grenade launchers custom integrated with the weapon.

The M203 DAX has a double-action trigger and longer breech opening to accommodate less-lethal rounds.

The M203 and M203A1 are currently manufactured by AIRTRONIC USA, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Illinois for the U.S. Department of Defense under contract numbers W52H09-06-D-0200 and W52H09-06-D-0225. Each contract is for up to 12,000 units. Each unit is shipped with hand guard, leaf sight and quadrant range sight. The contracts unit prices vary from $840 to $1,050 each. The production rate is 1,500 units per month. The M203PI is manufactured for both the U.S. Department of Defense and for commercial sales to law enforcement agencies both in the United States and abroad, and for foreign military sales by RM-Equipment Inc. of Miami, Florida.

The Turkish MKEK made &quot;T-40&quot; grenade launcher is based on the M203.

The M203 37 mm version became available on the U.S. market in 2017. It is available in a and a barrel version. They are scroll marked: &quot;Launcher, Grenade M203 40mm&quot;, even though they are actually 37 mm devices. These 37 mm versions are considered a &quot;title 1 firearm&quot;, and are not classified as &quot;destructive devices&quot; under the NFA. These launchers can be sold the same as regular firearms on an ATF Form 4473.

==Civilian ownership in the United States==
In the United States, M203 grenade launcher attachments fitted with the standard rifled 40 mm barrels are classified as &quot;destructive devices&quot; under the National Firearms Act (NFA) part 26 U.S.C. 5845, 27 CFR 479.11, because they are a &quot;non-sporting&quot; firearm with a bore greater than one-half inch in diameter. M203s are on the civilian NFA market but are limited as most manufacturers have quit selling to the civilian markets. New M203 launchers sell for approximately $2,000 plus a $200 transfer tax, and new manufacture 40 mm training ammunition is available for $5 to $10 per cartridge, as of March 2011. High explosive 40 mm grenades are available for $400 to $500 per cartridge; however, they are exceedingly rare on the civilian market, as each grenade constitutes a destructive device on its own, and must be registered with the federal government, requiring payment of a $200 tax and compliance with storage regulations for high explosives. There are also sub-caliber adapters available for the 40 mm M203 (and M79) grenade launchers, which will allow the use of standard 12-gauge shotgun shells and .22 rimfire ammo. 

In 2017, a 37 mm civilian version became available on the market that is not considered an NFA weapon. As the 37 mm version is not classified as a &quot;destructive device&quot;, it can be sold to the general public on the same ATF Form 4473 as most other firearms. The 37 mm launcher can use 37 mm flare rounds already available on the market. This civilian version sells for around $2,000 and accessories such as quick detach mounts and a quadrant sight are also available.

<text>Brixton Hill is the name given to a section of road between Brixton and Streatham Hill in south London, England.

Brixton Hill and Streatham Hill form part of the traditional main London to Brighton road (A23). The road follows the line of a Roman Road, the London to Brighton Way, which diverges from Stane Street near Kennington, and led south from the capital, Londinium, to a port on the south coast.

==History==
Prior to the late 19th century, the road was known as Brixton (or Bristow) Causeway. On the eastern side of the road, a series of tree-lined open spaces and front gardens make up Rush Common — an area of former common land that, although it is subject to a prohibition on &#x27;erections above the surface of the earth&#x27; under an Act of Parliament of 1806, has seen some incursions for building.

The name Brixton Hill has subsequently been given to the residential areas on both sides of the road, and from 2002 to 2022, it was also the name of an electoral ward of the London Borough of Lambeth.

From 1891 until the 1950s Brixton Hill was served by a regular London tram service; it was cable-drawn until 1904 when it was replaced by a conventional electric tram. The tram depot at Streatham Hill, opposite Telford Avenue, housed the tram cars, horses and the steam-powered winding gear for the cable. It is now a bus depot.
Another surviving tram shed, which can still be seen near the junction of Brixton Hill with Christchurch Road, was designed by London County Council Tramways&#x27; architect G. Topham Forest, and had a capacity of 30 trams.

==Notable residents==
*Edward Petherick, Australian bookseller and bibliophile lived at &quot;Yarra Yarra&quot; 30 Brixton Hill. He maintained a library, which was particularly extensive as regards Australia. George William Rusden was a frequent visitor when writing his books &quot;History of Australia&quot; and &quot;History of New Zealand&quot;.
*Tom Holland
*67 (rap group)
*Sarah Everard, a marketing executive was living here. She was murdered in 2021.

<doc id="453503" wikidata="Q4688999" url="?curid=453503" title="Affirmative action bake sale">
<text>An affirmative action bake sale is a type of campus protest event used by student groups to performatively criticize affirmative action policies by charging students different prices depending on which social or racial group they belong to. It has also been used to raise awareness of racial or sexual wage gaps.

==Methodology==
The bake sales offer to sell cookies at different prices depending on the customer&#x27;s race and sex, imitating racial and sexual orientation practices of affirmative action. For example, one such bake sale at the University of New Mexico charged $1.50 for Asian customers, $1 for whites, and 50 cents for African-Americans and Hispanics. 

According to one bake sale student leader, the goal of the technique is to &quot;bring the issue of affirmative action down to everyday terms.&quot;

These bake sales have been organized at many schools across the U.S., sometimes annually. Affirmative action bake sales have also taken place at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, the latest (in 2008) having been forcibly broken up by campus security.

==Reception==
The bake sales have met opposition, drawing crowds of students, sometimes facing opposition or restriction from campus administrations, often being accused of racism, and sometimes even being attacked. Additionally, some administrators have been accused of censorship and inappropriately advocating a political position.

Responding to an affirmative action bake sale being attacked at the University of Washington, the school&#x27;s Board of Regents President Jerry Grinstein presented the opinion of many opponents of these events when he described &quot;the statements [...] in putting on a bake sale about affirmative action were tasteless, divisive and hurtful to many members of the university community.&quot; The student leader of a bake sale at UCLA addressed this issue of divisiveness, saying &quot;we wanted to show how affirmative action is racial division, not racial reconciliation.&quot; Similarly, administrators at Bucknell University claimed that the bake sales violated the private university&#x27;s discrimination policy.

Other criticisms of the concept claim that these bake sales do not take into account ingrained social factors that favor white people. An opinion column in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; after a similar sale took place at Texas A&amp;M University held that &quot;Actions like these reinforce the common misconception that affirmative action policies give academically unqualified minority students a get-into-college-free card, and they ignore historical discrimination that denied nonwhites opportunities to be successful at any price, no matter their talents or intelligence.&quot; The editorial also praised school officials for not shutting down the sale.

At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, the Graduate and Professional Students of Color student organization responded to a bake sale held by the Students for Individual Liberty by holding a White Privilege popcorn giveaway where white males received a full bag of popcorn, while women and non-whites received 1/3 of a bag.

<text>Robert Reiniger Meredith Willson (May 18, 1902 – June 15, 1984) was an American flautist, composer, conductor, musical arranger, bandleader, playwright, and writer. He is perhaps best known for writing the book, music, and lyrics for the 1957 hit Broadway musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas&quot; (1951). Willson wrote three other musicals, two of which appeared on Broadway, and composed symphonies and popular songs. He was twice nominated for Academy Awards for film scores.

==Early life==
Willson was born in Mason City, Iowa, to Rosalie Reiniger Willson and John David Willson. He had a brother two years his senior, John Cedrick, and a sister 12 years his senior, children&#x27;s writer Dixie Willson. Willson attended Frank Damrosch&#x27;s Institute of Musical Art (which later became The Juilliard School) in New York City. He married his high-school sweetheart, Elizabeth &quot;Peggy&quot; Wilson, on August 29, 1920; they were married for 26 years.

As a child, Willson played the bass drum for a Salvation Army band. He became a flute and piccolo virtuoso accomplished enough to become a member of John Philip Sousa&#x27;s band (1921–1924) and later the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini (1924–1929). He then moved to San Francisco, California, as the concert director for radio station KFRC, and then as a musical director for the NBC radio network in Hollywood. His on-air radio debut came on KFRC in 1928 on &quot;Blue Monday Jamboree&quot;.

==Hollywood==
Willson&#x27;s work in many films included the score for Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940) (Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score), and arranging music for the score of William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1941) (Academy Award nomination for Best Music Score of a Dramatic Picture).
During World War II, Willson worked for the United States&#x27; Armed Forces Radio Service. His work with the AFRS teamed him with George Burns, Gracie Allen, and Bill Goodwin. He worked with all three as the bandleader, and a regular character, on the Burns and Allen radio program. He played a shy man always trying to get advice on women. His character was ditzy as well, basically a male version of Allen&#x27;s.

In 1942, Willson had his own program on NBC. &quot;Meredith Willson&#x27;s Music&quot; was a summer replacement for &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;. &quot;Sparkle Time&quot;, which ran on CBS in 1946–47, was Willson&#x27;s first full-season radio program.

Returning to network radio after WWII, Willson created the Talking People, a choral group that spoke in unison while delivering radio commercials. In 1950, he became the musical director for &quot;The Big Show&quot;, a 90-minute comedy-variety program hosted by actress Tallulah Bankhead and featuring some of the era&#x27;s best-known entertainers. Willson became part of one of the show&#x27;s very few running gags, beginning replies to Bankhead&#x27;s comments or questions with &quot;well, sir, Miss Bankhead&quot;. He wrote the song &quot;May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You&quot; for the show. Bankhead spoke the lyrics over the music at the end of each show. He also worked on Jack Benny&#x27;s radio program, and hosted his own program in 1949. For a few years in the early 1950s, Willson was a regular panelist on the Goodson-Todman game show &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot;; he recalled later that he did the show for the steady Goodson-Todman salary, which he was saving toward his Broadway musical project.

In 1950, Willson served as musical director for &quot;The California Story&quot;, California&#x27;s centennial production at the Hollywood Bowl. The show&#x27;s director, Vladimir Rosing, introduced Willson to writer Franklin Lacey, who proved instrumental in developing the storyline for a musical Willson had been working on, soon to become &quot;The Music Man&quot;. &quot;The California Story&quot; was followed by two more state centennial collaborations with Rosing: &quot;The Oregon Story&quot; in 1959 and &quot;The Kansas Story&quot; in 1961.

==Broadway==
Willson&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;The Music Man&quot;, premiered on Broadway in 1957, and was adapted twice for film (in 1962 and 2003). He called it &quot;an Iowan&#x27;s attempt to pay tribute to his home state&quot;. It took Willson eight years and 30 revisions to complete the musical, for which he wrote more than 40 songs. The show, starring Robert Preston and Barbara Cook, was a resounding success, running on Broadway for 1,375 performances over three and a half years. The cast recording won the first Grammy Award for Best Original Cast Album (Broadway or TV). The show subsequently had a national tour and international productions. It was produced at New York City Center in 1980 with Dick Van Dyke in the titular role and Meg Bussert as Marian. The first Broadway revival opened in 2000 at the Neil Simon Theatre with Craig Bierko as Harold Hill and Rebecca Luker as Marian. The production ran for 699 performances. A second Broadway revival premiered on February 10, 2022, at the Winter Garden Theatre, starring Hugh Jackman as Harold and Sutton Foster as Marian. In 1959, Willson and his second wife Ralina &quot;Rini&quot; Zarova recorded an album, &quot;... and Then I Wrote The Music Man&quot;, in which they review the history of, and sing songs from, the show. In 2010, Brian d&#x27;Arcy James and Kelli O&#x27;Hara played Willson and Rini in an off-Broadway entertainment based on that album.

Willson&#x27;s second musical, &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, ran on Broadway for 532 performances from 1960 to 1962 and was made into a 1964 motion picture starring Debbie Reynolds. His third Broadway musical was an adaptation of the film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, called &quot;Here&#x27;s Love&quot;. Some theater buffs recall it as a quick failure, but it actually enjoyed an eight-month run on Broadway in 1963–64 (334 performances). His fourth, last, and least successful musical was &quot;1491&quot;, which told the story of Columbus&#x27;s attempts to finance his famous voyage. It was produced by the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1969, but not on Broadway.

==Other works==
===Classical music===
Willson&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 in F minor: &quot;A Symphony of San Francisco&quot; and his Symphony No. 2 in E minor: &quot;Missions of California&quot; were recorded in 1999 by William T. Stromberg conducting the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra. Other symphonic works include the &quot;O.O. McIntyre Suite&quot;, &quot;Symphonic Variations on an American Theme and Anthem&quot;, the symphonic poem &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, and &quot;Ask Not&quot;, which incorporates quotations from John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural address. In tribute to the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts (ISOMATA), Willson composed &quot;In Idyllwild&quot; for orchestra, choir, vocal solo and Alphorn. Willson&#x27;s chamber music includes &quot;A Suite for Flute&quot;.

===Television specials===
In 1958, Willson appeared on the televised panel game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. His secret was that he &quot;wrote the new Salvation Army theme song.&quot; Willson wrote the song, &quot;With Banners and Bonnets They Come&quot;, especially for The Salvation Army. The song was a direct reference to The Salvation Army&#x27;s use of uniforms, flags, and symbols to &quot;love the unloved&quot;. In the television special, Willson conducted the New York Staff Band while a Salvation Army officer, Olaf Lundgren, sang the song. 

In 1964, Willson produced three original summer variety specials for CBS under the title &quot;Texaco Star Parade&quot;. The first premiered on June 5, 1964, and starred Willson and his wife Rini. It featured guest stars Caterina Valente and Sergio Franchi, and a production number with Willson leading four military bands composed of 500 California high school band members. The second special starred Debbie Reynolds singing songs she sang in the 1964 movie version of Willson&#x27;s Broadway musical &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown.&quot; On July 28, Willson and Rini hosted the third special, which featured a Willson production number with 1,000 Marine Corps volunteers from Camp Pendelton. Guest stars were Vikki Carr, Jack Jones, Frederick Hemke, and Joe and Eddie.

===Popular songs===
Willson wrote a number of well-known songs, such as &quot;You and I&quot;, a No. 1 hit for Glenn Miller in 1941 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It was also recorded by Bing Crosby, and by Tommy Dorsey with Frank Sinatra on vocals.

Three songs from &quot;The Music Man&quot; have become American standards: &quot;Seventy-Six Trombones&quot;, &quot;Gary, Indiana&quot;, and &quot;Till There Was You&quot;, originally titled &quot;Till I Met You&quot; (1950).

Other popular songs by Willson include &quot;It&#x27;s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas&quot; (published as &quot;It&#x27;s Beginning to Look Like Christmas&quot;), &quot;May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You&quot;, and &quot;I See the Moon&quot;. He wrote the University of Iowa&#x27;s fight song, &quot;Iowa Fight Song&quot;, as well as Iowa State University&#x27;s &quot;For I for S Forever&quot;. He also wrote the fight song for his hometown high school &quot;Mason City, Go!&quot; 

An oddity in Willson&#x27;s body of work is &quot;Chicken Fat&quot;, written in 1962. In school gymnasiums across the nation, this was the theme song for President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s youth fitness program. It was time to get the country&#x27;s youth into shape, and Willson&#x27;s song had youngsters moving through basic exercises at a frenetic pace: push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, torso twists, running in place, pogo springs, and plenty of marching. With an energetic lead vocal by Robert Preston, orchestral marching band, and full chorus, it was recorded during sessions for &quot;The Music Man&quot; film. Two versions of the song exist: a three-minute, radio-friendly length, and a longer, six-minute version for use in the gymnasium. In 2014, a re-recording of &quot;Chicken Fat&quot; was used in a television commercial for the iPhone 5S.

In 1974, Willson offered another marching song, &quot;Whip Inflation Now&quot;, to the Ford Administration.

===Autobiography===
Willson wrote three memoirs: &quot;And There I Stood With My Piccolo&quot; (1948), &quot;Eggs I Have Laid&quot; (1955), and &quot;But He Doesn&#x27;t Know the Territory&quot; (1959).

==Personal life==

Willson was married three times. He was divorced by his first wife, Elizabeth, as reported in a news dispatch of March 5, 1947. They apparently had no contact after the divorce, and in his three memoirs Elizabeth is never mentioned, although he surprised her by sending her roses on August 20, 1970, which would have been their 50th wedding anniversary.

Willson married Ralina &quot;Rini&quot; Zarova, a Russian opera singer, on March 13, 1948. She died on December 6, 1966. Willson married Rosemary Sullivan in February 1968. For years he lived in the Mandeville Canyon section of Brentwood, California; he was fondly remembered by friends and neighbors as a warm and gregarious host who loved nothing more than to play the piano and sing at parties. He often gave guests autographed copies of his album &quot;Meredith Willson Sings Songs from The Music Man&quot;. In 1982, he and Rosemary appeared in the audience of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

Willson returned several times to his hometown for the North Iowa Band Festival, an annual event celebrating music with a special emphasis on marching bands. Mason City was the site of the 1962 premiere of the motion picture &quot;The Music Man&quot;, hosted by Iowa Governor Norman Erbe, which was timed to coincide with the festival. Like his character Harold Hill, Willson led the &quot;Big Parade&quot; through the town, and the event included special appearances by the film&#x27;s stars Shirley Jones and Robert Preston. The Master of Ceremonies, Mason City &quot;Globe-Gazette&quot; editor W. Earl Hall, was a statewide radio personality and friend of many decades.

Willson was a member of the National Honorary Band Fraternity, Kappa Kappa Psi.

Willson died of heart failure in 1984 at the age of 82. His funeral in Mason City included mourners dressed in &quot;Music Man&quot; costumes and a barbershop quartet that sang &quot;Lida Rose&quot;. Willson is buried at the Elmwood-St. Joseph Municipal Cemetery in Mason City.

<doc id="453516" wikidata="Q353454" url="?curid=453516" title="Horace Andy">
<text>Horace Andy (born Horace Keith Hinds, 19 February 1951) is a Jamaican roots reggae songwriter and singer, known for his distinctive vocals and hit songs such as &quot;Government Land&quot;, as well as &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Spying Glass&quot;, and &quot;Five Man Army&quot; with English trip hop group Massive Attack. He is also famous for a cover version of &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot;. Andy is often described as one of the most respected and influential singers in Jamaica.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Hinds recorded his first single, &quot;This is a Black Man&#x27;s Country,&quot; in 1967 for producer Phil Pratt. &quot;This is a Black Man&#x27;s Country&quot; failed to make an impact, and it would be 1970 before he achieved a breakthrough. After unsuccessfully auditioning at Coxsone Dodd&#x27;s Studio One as a duo along with Frank Melody, he successfully auditioned on his own a few days later. Dodd decided Hinds should record as Horace Andy, partly to capitalise on the popularity of Bob Andy, and partly to avoid comparisons with his cousin, Justin Hinds, with whom his singing style at the time showed a resemblance. &quot;Got To Be Sure&quot;, the song he had auditioned with, became his first release for Studio One. The following two years saw the release of further singles such as &quot;See a Man&#x27;s Face&quot;, &quot;Night Owl&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Bassie&quot;. One of Andy&#x27;s most enduring songs, &quot;Skylarking&quot;, first appeared on Dodd&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Today&quot; compilation album, but after proving a sound system success, it was released as a single, going on to top the Jamaican chart. The next few years saw Andy regularly in the reggae chart with further singles for Dodd such as &quot;Something on My Mind&quot;, &quot;Love of a Woman&quot;, &quot;Just Say Who&quot;, and &quot;Every Tongue Shall Tell&quot;, as well as singles for other producers such as &quot;Lonely Woman&quot; (for Derrick Harriott), &quot;Girl I Love You&quot; (Ernest and Joseph Hoo Kim), &quot;Love You to Want Me&quot; and &quot;Delilah&quot; (Gussie Clarke), and &quot;Get Wise&quot;, &quot;Feel Good&quot;, and &quot;Money Money&quot; for Phil Pratt. Andy had a second Jamaican number one single in 1973 with &quot;Children of Israel&quot;. Andy&#x27;s most successful association with a producer, however, was with Bunny Lee in the middle part of the 1970s. This era produced a series of singles now regarded as classics such as a re-recorded &quot;Skylarking&quot;, &quot;Just Say Who&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Try To Use Me&quot;, &quot;You Are My Angel&quot;, &quot;Zion Gate&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Get Away&quot;, and a new version of &quot;Something on My Mind&quot;.

In 1977, Andy moved to Hartford, Connecticut, with his first wife, Claudette, where he recorded for Everton DaSilva, including the &quot;In The Light&quot; album and its associated dub album, and singles such as &quot;Do You Love My Music&quot; and &quot;Government Land&quot;. In 1979, Tapper Zukie released on his own Stars label, Horace Andy and Headley Bennett&#x27;s discomix, &quot;If I Wasn&#x27;t a Man&quot; tune, built around a variation on the horns refrain from Sound Dimension&#x27;s Real Rock rhythm. In 1978, both Horace Andy and Freddie McKay recorded their own discomix versions of Wentworth Vernal&#x27;s Studio One Coxsone Dodd hit tune, &quot;The Rainbow”. Horace Andy&#x27;s version was released on Tapper Zukie&#x27;s Roots Rocker&#x27;s label &quot;Stars&quot;, Freddie McKay&#x27;s version on the well-received &quot;Creation&quot; album. Andy also set up his own Rhythm label, which became an outlet for his work with DaSilva. The association with the producer was brought to an abrupt end when DaSilva was murdered in 1979. Andy&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Pure Ranking&quot; had anticipated the rise of dancehall reggae, and he was a key figure in the early development of the genre, confirmed by 1982&#x27;s groundbreaking, epoch making &quot;Dance Hall Style&quot; album, released on the Bullwackie&#x27;s label, out of his studio in White Plains Road in The Bronx. &quot;Dance Hall Style&quot;, amongst other albums Wackie&#x27;s released in that period, is now considered a classic. Andy continued to record with a variety of producers in the first half of the 1980s. In 1985, with his second wife Caroline, he relocated to Ladbroke Grove, London, and he recorded in the United Kingdom as well as regularly visiting Jamaica for further recording work.

===Mainstream success with Massive Attack and after===
1990 saw Andy&#x27;s profile further raised when he began collaborating with Bristol trip hop pioneers Massive Attack, contributing to all five of their albums. He sang vocals on five tracks on their third album, &quot;Mezzanine&quot;, including on the song &quot;Angel&quot; (a new version of &quot;You Are My Angel&quot;). On their 2010 release &quot;Heligoland&quot;, Andy sang on the tracks &quot;Splitting the Atom&quot; and &quot;Girl I Love You&quot;. In the mid-1990s, he also worked with Mad Professor, releasing the albums &quot;Life Is for Living&quot; and &quot;Roots and Branches&quot;. He then continued to record new music, with the album &quot;Living in the Flood&quot;, released in 1999 on Massive Attack&#x27;s Melankolic record label, and &quot;Mek It Bun&quot; in 2002. He also featured on the world music project 1 Giant Leap and on the Easy Star All-Stars 2006 album &quot;Radiodread&quot;.

2022 saw the release of Andy&#x27;s album &quot;Midnight Rocker&quot;, produced by Adrian Sherwood of On-U Sound. Andy&#x27;s vocals were recorded in Jamaica, with the tracks sent back and forth between vocalist and producer until they were complete. The album received critical acclaim upon its release.

===Personal life===
Andy is a Rastafarian.

Some of his lyrics have been criticized for being homophobic. Andy confirmed that Trojan Records only agreed to release his album &quot;On Tour&quot; after removing a track containing the lyrics &quot;The Father never make Adam and Steve, he make Adam and Eve&quot;.

<text>In photography, bracketing is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings, typically with the aim of combining the images in postprocessing. Bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot, especially when a small variation in exposure parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image. Given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots, it is typically, but not always, used for static subjects. Autobracketing is a feature of many modern cameras. When set, it will automatically take several bracketed shots, rather than the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot.

== Types of bracketing ==

===Exposure bracketing===

Without further qualifications, the term &quot;bracketing&quot; usually refers to exposure bracketing: the photographer chooses to take one picture at a given exposure, one or more brighter, and one or more darker, in order to select the most satisfactory image. Technically, this can be accomplished by changing either the shutter speed or the aperture, or, with digital cameras, the ISO speed, or combinations thereof. Exposure can also be changed by altering the light level, for example using neutral-gray filters or changing the degree of illumination of the subject (e.g. artificial light, flash). Since the aim here is to alter the amount of exposure, but not otherwise the visual effect, exposure compensation for static subjects is typically performed by altering the shutter speed, for as long as this is feasible.

Many professional and advanced amateur cameras, including digital cameras, can automatically shoot a bracketed series of pictures, while even the cheaper ones have a less convenient but still effective manual exposure compensation control.

Exposure bracketing is indicated when dealing with high-contrast subjects and/or media with limited dynamic range, such as transparency film or CCD sensors in many digital cameras.

Exposure bracketing is also used to create fade-in or fade-out effects, for example in conjunction with multi-vision slide shows, or in combination with multiple exposure or flash.

When shooting using negative film, the person printing the pictures to paper must not compensate for the deliberately underexposed and overexposed pictures. If a set of photos are bracketed but are then printed using automated equipment, the equipment may assume that the camera or photographer made an error and automatically &quot;correct&quot; the shots it determines are &quot;improperly&quot; done.

Images produced using exposure bracketing are often combined in postprocessing to create a high dynamic range image that exposes different portions of the image by different amounts.

===Flash bracketing===

Flash bracketing is a technique of working with electronic flash, especially when used as fill flash in combination with existing light, maintaining the overall amount of exposure. The amount of light provided by the flash is varied in a bracketed series in order to find the most pleasing combination of ambient light and fill flash. If used for this purpose, flash bracketing can be differentiated from normal exposure bracketing via flash, although the usage of the term is not strict.

Alternatively, if the amount of flash light cannot be altered easily (for example with studio flashes), it is also possible to alter the aperture instead, however, this will also affect the depth of field and ambient light exposure. If the flash to ambient light ratio is to be changed in flash bracketing using this technique, it is necessary to counter-shift the shutter speed as well in order to maintain the level of ambient light exposure, however, with focal plane shutters, this is often difficult to achieve given their limited X-sync speed - and flash techniques such as high-speed synchronization are not available with studio flashes.

===Depth-of-field bracketing===

DOF (Depth-of-field) bracketing comprises taking a series of pictures in stepped apertures (f-stops), while maintaining the exposure, either by counter-shifting the shutter speed or, with digital cameras, adapting the ISO speed accordingly. In the first case, it will also change the amount of motion blur in the picture. In the second case, it may visibly affect image noise and contrast.

Combining DOF bracketing with multiple exposure, the so-called &quot;STF effect&quot; (for &quot;Smooth Trans Focus&quot;) can be achieved as implemented in the Minolta Maxxum 7&#x27;s automated STF function. This closely resembles the Bokeh-pleasing optical effect of the apodization filter in the Minolta/Sony STF 135 mm f/2.8 [T4.5]&#x27;s special-purpose lens.

===Focus bracketing===

Focus bracketing is useful in situations with limited depth of field, such as macro photography, where one may want to make a series of exposures with different positions of the focal plane and then choose the one in which the largest portion of the subject is in focus, or combine the in-focus portions of multiple exposures digitally (focus stacking). Usually this involves the use of software with unsharp masking, a filtering algorithm that removes out-of-focus portions of each exposure. The in-focus portions are then &quot;stacked&quot;; combined into a single image. Focus stacking is challenging, in that the subject (as in all brackets) must stay still and that as the focal point changes, the magnification (and position) of the images change. This must then be corrected in a suitable application by transforming the image.

===White balance bracketing===

White balance bracketing, which is specific to digital photography, provides a way of dealing with mixed lighting by shooting several images with different white point settings, often ranging from bluish images to reddish images.

When shooting in a camera&#x27;s raw format (if supported), white balance can be arbitrarily changed in postprocessing as well, so white balance bracketing is particularly useful for reviewing different white balance settings in the field.

In contrast to manual white balance bracketing, which requires the photographer to take multiple shots, automatic white-balance bracketing, as it is implemented in many digital cameras, requires a single exposure only.

===ISO bracketing===

ISO bracketing is a form of simulated exposure bracketing in which aperture and shutter speed (thus depth of field and motion blur) remain constant. The brightness levels in this case are only altered by increasing or decreasing gain, or amplification of the digital signal prior to the conversion to an image file such as a JPEG or Tag Image File Format (TIFF). This type of bracketing must be performed with the camera in Manual mode but is easy to implement simply by shooting a single properly exposed image in RAW and applying exposure compensation in post processing. This is analogous to &quot;pushing&quot; or &quot;pulling&quot; in film processing, and as in film processing, will affect the amount of &quot;grain&quot; or image noise.

It is also possible to apply a type of ISO bracketing which brackets the signal gain while maintaining a constant level of brightness in the finished photograph. In this case the exposure compensation (EV value) setting remains constant while bracketing the ISO value in Av, TV, or P mode, which will have a corresponding effect on the shutter speed, aperture value, or both. This form of ISO bracketing could potentially affect not only image noise, but also depth of field and motion blur.

In-camera automatic ISO bracketing is uncommon and therefore must usually be performed manually.

<text>The Arkansas Territory was a territory of the United States from July 4, 1819, to June 15, 1836, when the final extent of Arkansas Territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Arkansas. Arkansas Post was the first territorial capital (1819–1821) and Little Rock was the second (1821–1836).

==Etymology==
The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the Territory of Arkansaw on March 2, 1819, but the final extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically pronounced , , and had several other pronunciation variants. In 1881, the Arkansas General Assembly passed the following concurrent resolution (Arkansas Statutes, Title 1, Chapter 4, Section 105):
Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.
And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.
Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final &quot;s&quot; silent, the &quot;a&quot; in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;man&quot; and the sounding of the terminal &quot;s&quot; is an innovation to be discouraged.
Residents of Kansas often pronounce the Arkansas River as in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.

==History==
The first official use of the name Arkansas came in 1806 when the southern portion of New Madrid County in Louisiana Territory was designated as the District of Arkansas. In 1813, it became Arkansas County in Missouri Territory. When Missouri applied for statehood, it requested a southern boundary at 36º30′, except for a small section between the St. Francis River and the Mississippi River, where it extended south to 36º. This line later became the northern boundary of the Arkansas Territory.

On March 2, 1819, at the penultimate meeting of the 15th United States Congress, Congress passed the Arkansas organic act (3 Stat. L. 493), providing for the creation of the Arkansaw Territory on July 4, 1819, from the portion of the Missouri Territory lying south of a point on the Mississippi River at 36 degrees north latitude running west to the St. Francis River, then following the river to 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, then west to the territorial boundary. This included all of the present state of Oklahoma south of the parallel 36°30&#x27; north. The westernmost portion of the territory was removed on November 15, 1824, and a second westernmost portion was removed on May 6, 1828, reducing the territory to the extent of the present state of Arkansas.

Originally the western border of Missouri was intended to go due south to the Red River. During negotiations with the Choctaw in 1820, however, Andrew Jackson unknowingly ceded more of Arkansas Territory. Then in 1824, after further negotiations, the Choctaw agreed to move farther west, but only by &quot;100 paces&quot; of the garrison on Belle Point. This resulted in the bend in the common border at Fort Smith.

The territory originally had nine counties: Arkansas, Clark, Crawford (which included Lovely&#x27;s Purchase), Hempstead, Independence, Lawrence, Miller, Phillips, and Pulaskị.

==Demographics==

In the 1830 United States census, 23 counties in the Arkansas Territory reported the following population counts (after only 7 reported the following counts in the 1820 United States census):

These census counts did not include Native Americans, and the earlier count includes 1,617 slaves. Though a census of Cherokee was to be taken as part of the Jackson and McMinn Treaty in 1818, it was never conducted. Instead, when the treaty was renegotiated in 1819, it used John C. Calhoun&#x27;s estimate of 5000 Cherokee in Arkansas, despite the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s estimate of 3,500. The Quapaw were counted at 455 in the mid 1820s.

==Law and government==

Robert Crittenden was the territorial secretary until 1829 and the &quot;de facto&quot; territorial governor, preparing Arkansas for statehood. Until present-day Oklahoma received statehood, Fort Smith served as the ostensible legal authority overseeing the Indian Territory. The Army oversaw issues dealing with the Indian Nations.

<doc id="453539" wikidata="Q150209" url="?curid=453539" title="North Finchley">
<text>North Finchley is a suburb of London in the London Borough of Barnet, situated seven miles (11 km) northwest of Charing Cross. North Finchley is centred on Tally Ho Corner, the junction of the roads to East Finchley, Church End, Friern Barnet and Whetstone. Church End is usually known as Finchley Central, owing to the name of the tube station located there.

North Finchley offers an array of amenities, including parks such as Victoria Park, providing residents and visitors alike with spaces for relaxation and recreation. Excellent transport links, including bus routes and nearby tube stations like Woodside Park and Finchley Central, facilitate easy travel to and from central London and surrounding areas.

Lodge Lane has a large car park, part of which is used as a Tuesday market.

==Character==
It is primarily a residential and shopping area, with several supermarkets and many restaurants. The &quot;artsdepot&quot;, a local community arts centre including a gallery, a studio and a theatre, was opened on 23 October 2004 in an attempt to revitalise the area, and in order to fill a gap created by the demolition of the Gaumont cinema and what had become an open-air market.

The area has mainly 19th-century housing, ranging from quaint Victorian cottages to substantially larger Victorian double-fronted houses. There is also a dominant Edwardian style toward Woodside Park and Nether Street, but with some modern houses—probably built between the 1930s and 1960s—towards Friern Barnet. There are some mansion-style properties on Friern Barnet Lane, and a development of luxury flats at Tally Ho Corner, above the &quot;artsdepot&quot;, with views over Mill Hill and Hertfordshire. There are few local authority estates in the area; the largest one is in Woodside Park where ex-Spice Girl Emma Bunton grew up.

==Transport==
The new North Finchley bus station opened in 2004; however, it closed several months later owing to safety issues, after a pensioner walked into the shelter through the wrong entrance, was hit by a bus, and died. The bus station was reopened in March 2007 after safety improvements had been implemented.

The bus station is served by routes 13, 125, 221 (to Edgware only), 460, 683, SL1 and SL10. From the stop on the Great North Road going south, it is served by routes 112, 134, 221 (to Turnpike Lane only), 263, 383, 626 and night bus route N271. The &#x27;Cricketers&#x27; pub used to stand adjacent to the old bus station.

The area is served by West Finchley and Woodside Park tube stations, both on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line.

==Balfour House bombing==
On 26 July 1994 a bomb exploded outside Balfour House, a prominent building on North Finchley High Street and location of the offices of numerous Jewish charities. Earlier on the same day, a bomb had exploded outside the Israeli embassy. Two Palestinians, Samar Alami and Jawad Botmeh, were subsequently convicted of carrying out the Finchley bombing.

==History==
An urban district of Finchley, part of the then county of Middlesex (since abolished) was created in 1894. In 1932 the Municipal Borough of Finchley was created, but in 1965 the municipal borough was abolished and its area became part of the London Borough of Barnet.

Margaret Thatcher was elected as MP for Finchley in 1959; she served until her retirement from the House of Commons in 1992.

=== Tally Ho Corner and the High Road ===
North End, the old name for the area of North Finchley and Whetstone, was first recorded in 1462. North Finchley did not develop into an urban area until after the enclosure of Finchley Common after 1816. Prior to that, in 1627, Thomas Rawson was allowed to construct a windmill and house which by 1722 had also become an inn, the Windmill. By 1754 the inn was called the Swan with Two Nicks and had ceased as a mill. The site is now a police garage.

Ballards Lane is an ancient road which was probably named after the Ballard family of about 1300. It did not always connect with the High Road. For many centuries it terminated near where Victoria Park is today. In 1756 a raised way was constructed from the end of Ballards Lane to the High Road, then the Great North Road, making North Finchley a junction. This suggests that Ballards Lane had already become a link in a route from London via Hendon to the Great North Road. There was a beer house in 1814, licensed to provide gunpowder and shot, near the junction.

The name &quot;Tally Ho&quot; allegedly originates from the 1830s when a coaching company of the same name based a staging post of 16 horses on the corner, serving as a stop where the horses were changed on their way to Birmingham. There is, however, no direct evidence of the company ever having existed; local historians believe that it is unlikely that the company ever existed, or that the horses would have needed changing so early on in their journey from London to Birmingham. But it was later, with the enclosure of the Common after 1816 and the creation of the Finchley Road turnpike along Ballards Lane in the late 1820s, that beginnings of a suburb were sparked.

Charles Jacques built twenty-one cottages in Lodge Lane around 1824 and constructed Torrington Cottage as a residence. By the 1830s there were other houses and in 1837 a dissenting chapel, &quot;Cottagers Chapel&quot;, which had been converted from the stables of Orchard Cottage.

By 1839 North Finchley had at least five retail outlets including a blacksmith called Elizabeth Humphreys. These were on Lodge Lane rather than on the High Road. Incidentally Lodge Lane was the home of Private John Parr the first British soldier to be killed in World War I, and the actor David Jason.

In 1851, there was a regular &#x27;bus service running from the Torrington to Charing Cross and railway connections had been established with London, first at New Southgate. During the 1850s and 1860s Woodside Lane, Torrington Park, Friern Park, Grove Road, Finsbury Road (now Finchley Park) had all been laid out. In 1872 the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway opened Torrington Park Station which was renamed Woodside Park in 1882. It was during the construction of a railway through Finchley from 1864 that a Reverend Henry Stephens opened a mission for the navvies working on the line. A church had been constructed by 1869 which was formally opened in 1870 as Christ Church. It became a new parish in 1872. By 1874 it was said that there were 350 dwellings within this ecclesiastical parish.

In 1905. the Metropolitan Electric Tramways (the M.E.T.) opened a tramline between Highgate and Whetstone and this was crossed by another from New Southgate to Golders Green from 1909. To facilitate this a tramway depot was opened in Woodberry Grove. Trams combined with motorbus services promoted the development of the retail district we see today. During the 1930s the old Ballards Lane, which terminated where the Embassy Lounge (formerly called the Purple Rain Bar, before that the Cherry Tree and previously the Coach Stop) is today, was replaced by a new road called Kingsway. In 1937 the new plot created by this diversion became the location for the Gaumont Cinema. This was demolished in 1987 to be replaced with the recently opened Arts Depot.

The Finchley Meeting House, the local Quaker place of worship, was built on Alexandra Grove in 1967. Quakers had met in the area since 1945.

===Woodhouse and the Rough Lots===
The Woodhouse area of Finchley began with three houses called the Woodhouses sometime before 1655. In the mid-18th century there was a single house of this name and it was home to the well-known plasterer Thomas Collins. It was reconstructed in 1888 and in 1925 it became Woodhouse Grammar School (Now Woodhouse College).

Summers Lane existed from at least the 18th century as a short cut from the main road through to Friern Barnet. Below it and to the east is a small pocket of woodland called Coppetts Wood, one of the last remnants of the medieval Finchley Wood. Close to Coppetts Wood a sewage farm was established by Finchley in 1885, of which, since the area&#x27;s sewage was diverted to Deephams Sewage Treatment Works, Edmonton in 1961, only the manager&#x27;s cottage remains.

A small isolation hospital with 18 beds was established: it evolved to become Coppetts Wood Hospital.

After enclosure the eastern end of Summers Lane was developed by Henry Dunger, owner of the Flower Pot brewery in Dunger Place (now Summers Place), from the 1830s until the 1870s.

The area popularly called the Rough Lots, officially called the Glebe Land, was the location (from 1879 until the early 20th century) of John Lawford&#x27;s brick works. On a site where Summers Lane meets the High Road a gun battery was placed in World War I as a defence against early German air raids.

Finchley football club (now Wingate and Finchley F.C.), founded in 1874, started playing football on the Glebe Lands in 1932. Ken Aston, late president of the club, was the man who started the system of red and yellow cards use by referees.

The Finchley Lido was a swimming pool opened by Finchley Borough Council in September 1931. A tour de force of art deco, the main pool was heated until World War II. During the 1948 Olympic Games the pool was used for the water polo events. (Only a men&#x27;s event in those days.) The pool was the first element in a Finchley complex which was to include a Town Hall for which plans were drawn up in 1936 but never realised.

In 1938 the War Office built a drill hall at the bottom of the hill for the 61 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regt RA (TA), better known locally as the T.A. centre. The open air pool was closed in 1992 and replaced by the present complex in May 1996 The T.A. centre was demolished in 2004.

===Fallow Corner===
The area of Fallow Corner was recorded in 1429, probably Cobley&#x27;s Farm (so called by the 17th century). By the 18th century there was a small hamlet of houses and the access roads from these to the main road formed the distinct Bow Road we see today.

Between 1806 and 1827 the clown Joseph Grimaldi lived here. It was whilst &quot;ghost writing&quot; Grimaldi&#x27;s memoirs that Charles Dickens probably first stayed at the farm during 1836 and 1837. Later, in 1843, he returned and wrote portions of Martin Chuzzlewit, conceiving the character of &#x27;Sairey&#x27; Gamp whilst out walking in Finchley. The Farm&#x27;s fields were realised for building, as the Etchingham Park Estate, between 1878 and 1920, the farm itself disappearing in 1905.

Two institutions occupied the fields within the bow of Bow Lane.
Finchley Cottage Hospital opened with 18 beds in 1908 and was renamed the Finchley Memorial Hospital in 1922. The original hospital was paid for out of subscriptions and the later extensions raised to form a memorial for the Finchley dead of World War I.
Finchley County School was opened in 1903. Dame Evelyn Turner (1910–1993), on whose life the television series &quot;Tenko&quot; was partially based, went to school here. The building was demolished in 2004.

===Moss Hall and Woodside Park===
On the north western edge of Finchley Common there were four houses by the 17th century. At Nether Street was Moss Hall, a name taken from a house in the area which may have existed in the 15th century (named after the Mosse family), and certainly in existence since the 18th century. The house was demolished in 1927 after much of the estate had been built on after the 1860s. The name survives in the names of streets such as Moss Hall Grove and, until the 1990s, a pub called the Moss Hall Tavern (the pub still exists but has been renamed the Elephant Inn).

Further up was Court House which may have been the house in 1664 owned by the Peacock Family who owned Frith Manor. Prior to the building of Frith manor house in 1790 the Court House was the main house of the estate and it is possible that the manorial courts were held here (hence the name). The house was demolished and the remnants of the estate sold in 1936.

Finchley Lodge (from which Lodge Lane takes its name) may have existed by 1564 and was certainly there by 1667. Finally there was Woodside House, again possibly a medieval property but certainly known by 1699, around which a small hamlet had developed by the 1750s. By the 1800s it was called Woodside Farm and when the estate was left to Henry Holden, after whom Holden Road is named, the estate was developed into housing as the Woodside Park Estate. 

Holden built an assembly room, Woodside Hall, in 1885. In 1950 it was converted to a synagogue. St Barnabas church was established as a tin chapel in 1885 and as a proper church in 1912. Spike Milligan, the comedian, lived in Holden Road.

<text>Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is a robotic space probe mission to Mars launched by NASA on November 26, 2011, which successfully landed &quot;Curiosity&quot;, a Mars rover, in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012. The overall objectives include investigating Mars&#x27; habitability, studying its climate and geology, and collecting data for a human mission to Mars. The rover carries a variety of scientific instruments designed by an international team.

== Overview ==

MSL successfully carried out the most accurate Martian landing of any known spacecraft at the time, hitting a small target landing ellipse of only , in the Aeolis Palus region of Gale Crater. In the event, MSL achieved a landing east and north of the center of the target. This location is near the mountain Aeolis Mons (a.k.a. &quot;Mount Sharp&quot;). The rover mission is set to explore for at least 687 Earth days (1 Martian year) over a range of .

The Mars Science Laboratory mission is part of NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort for the robotic exploration of Mars that is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of California Institute of Technology. The total cost of the MSL project is about US$2.5 billion.

Previous successful U.S. Mars rovers include &quot;Sojourner&quot; from the Mars Pathfinder mission and the Mars Exploration Rovers &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;. &quot;Curiosity&quot; is about twice as long and five times as heavy as &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;, and carries over ten times the mass of scientific instruments.

== Goals and objectives ==

The MSL mission has four scientific goals: Determine the landing site&#x27;s habitability including the role of water, the study of the climate and the geology of Mars. It is also useful preparation for a future human mission to Mars.

To contribute to these goals, MSL has eight main scientific objectives:
;Biological:
* (1) Determine the nature and inventory of organic carbon compounds
* (2) Investigate the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur)
* (3) Identify features that may represent the effects of biological processes (biosignatures)

;Geological and geochemical:
* (4) Investigate the chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical composition of the Martian surface and near-surface geological materials
* (5) Interpret the processes that have formed and modified rocks and soils

;Planetary process
* (6) Assess long-timescale (i.e., 4-billion-year) Martian atmospheric evolution processes
* (7) Determine present state, distribution, and cycling of water and carbon dioxide

;Surface radiation
* (8) Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation, including cosmic radiation, solar particle events and secondary neutrons. As part of its exploration, it also measured the radiation exposure in the interior of the spacecraft as it traveled to Mars, and it is continuing radiation measurements as it explores the surface of Mars. This data would be important for a future human mission.

About one year into the surface mission, and having assessed that ancient Mars could have been hospitable to microbial life, the MSL mission objectives evolved to developing predictive models for the preservation process of organic compounds and biomolecules; a branch of paleontology called taphonomy.

== Specifications ==

=== Spacecraft ===
The spacecraft flight system had a mass at launch of , consisting of an Earth-Mars fueled cruise stage (), the entry-descent-landing (EDL) system ( including of landing propellant), and a mobile rover with an integrated instrument package.

The MSL spacecraft includes spaceflight-specific instruments, in addition to utilizing one of the rover instruments — Radiation assessment detector (RAD) — during the spaceflight transit to Mars.
* MSL EDL Instrument (MEDLI): The MEDLI project&#x27;s main objective is to measure aerothermal environments, sub-surface heat shield material response, vehicle orientation, and atmospheric density. The MEDLI instrumentation suite was installed in the heatshield of the MSL entry vehicle. The acquired data will support future Mars missions by providing measured atmospheric data to validate Mars atmosphere models and clarify the lander design margins on future Mars missions. MEDLI instrumentation consists of three main subsystems: MEDLI Integrated Sensor Plugs (MISP), Mars Entry Atmospheric Data System (MEADS) and the Sensor Support Electronics (SSE).

=== Rover ===
&quot;Curiosity&quot; rover has a mass of , can travel up to per hour on its six-wheeled rocker-bogie system, is powered by a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG), and communicates in both X band and UHF bands.
* Computers: The two identical on-board rover computers, called &quot;Rover Compute Element&quot; (RCE), contain radiation-hardened memory to tolerate the extreme radiation from space and to safeguard against power-off cycles. Each computer&#x27;s memory includes 256 KB of EEPROM, 256 MB of DRAM, and 2 GB of flash memory. This compares to 3 MB of EEPROM, 128 MB of DRAM, and 256 MB of flash memory used in the Mars Exploration Rovers.

:The RCE computers use the RAD750 CPU (a successor to the RAD6000 CPU used in the Mars Exploration Rovers) operating at 200 MHz. The RAD750 CPU is capable of up to 400 MIPS, while the RAD6000 CPU is capable of up to 35 MIPS. Of the two on-board computers, one is configured as backup, and will take over in the event of problems with the main computer.

:The rover has an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that provides 3-axis information on its position, which is used in rover navigation. The rover&#x27;s computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep the rover operational, such as by regulating the rover&#x27;s temperature. Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to the rover.

The rover&#x27;s computers run VxWorks, a real-time operating system from Wind River Systems. During the trip to Mars, VxWorks ran applications dedicated to the navigation and guidance phase of the mission, and also had a pre-programmed software sequence for handling the complexity of the entry-descent-landing. Once landed, the applications were replaced with software for driving on the surface and performing scientific activities.


* Communications: &quot;Curiosity&quot; is equipped with several means of communication, for redundancy. An X band Small Deep Space Transponder for communication directly to Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network and a UHF Electra-Lite software-defined radio for communicating with Mars orbiters. The X-band system has one radio, with a 15 W power amplifier, and two antennas: a low-gain omnidirectional antenna that can communicate with Earth at very low data rates (15 bit/s at maximum range), regardless of rover orientation, and a high-gain antenna that can communicate at speeds up to 32 kbit/s, but must be aimed. The UHF system has two radios (approximately 9 W transmit power), sharing one omnidirectional antenna. This can communicate with the &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; (MRO) and &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot; orbiter (ODY) at speeds up to 2 Mbit/s and 256 kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is only able to communicate with &quot;Curiosity&quot; for about 8 minutes per day. The orbiters have larger antennas and more powerful radios, and can relay data to Earth faster than the rover could do directly. Therefore, most of the data returned by &quot;Curiosity&quot; (MSL) is via the UHF relay links with MRO and ODY. The data return during the first 10 days was approximately 31 megabytes per day.

:Typically 225 kbit/day of commands are transmitted to the rover directly from Earth, at a data rate of 1–2 kbit/s, during a 15-minute (900 second) transmit window, while the larger volumes of data collected by the rover are returned via satellite relay. The one-way communication delay with Earth varies from 4 to 22 minutes, depending on the planets&#x27; relative positions, with 12.5 minutes being the average.

:At landing, telemetry was monitored by the &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot; orbiter, &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; and ESA&#x27;s &quot;Mars Express&quot;. Odyssey is capable of relaying UHF telemetry back to Earth in real time. The relay time varies with the distance between the two planets and took 13:46 minutes at the time of landing.
* Mobility systems: &quot;Curiosity&quot; is equipped with six wheels in a rocker-bogie suspension, which also served as landing gear for the vehicle, unlike its smaller predecessors. The wheels are significantly larger ( diameter) than those used on previous rovers. Each wheel has cleats and is independently actuated and geared, providing for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks. The four corner wheels can be independently steered, allowing the vehicle to turn in place as well as execute arcing turns. Each wheel has a pattern that helps it maintain traction and leaves patterned tracks in the sandy surface of Mars. That pattern is used by on-board cameras to judge the distance traveled. The pattern itself is Morse code for &quot;JPL&quot; (•−−− •−−• •−••). Based on the center of mass, the vehicle can withstand a tilt of at least 50 degrees in any direction without overturning, but automatic sensors will limit the rover from exceeding 30-degree tilts.
==== Instruments ====

The general analysis strategy begins with high resolution cameras to look for features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, &quot;Curiosity&quot; can vaporize a small portion of it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock&#x27;s elemental composition. If that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look. If the specimen warrants further analysis, &quot;Curiosity&quot; can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover.
* Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS): This device can irradiate samples with alpha particles and map the spectra of X-rays that are re-emitted for determining the elemental composition of samples.
* CheMin: CheMin is short for &#x27;Chemistry and Mineralogy&#x27;, and it is an X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence analyzer. It will identify and quantify the minerals present in rocks and soil and thereby assess the involvement of water in their formation, deposition, or alteration. In addition, CheMin data will be useful in the search for potential mineral biosignatures, energy sources for life or indicators for past habitable environments.
* Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM): The SAM instrument suite will analyze organics and gases from both atmospheric and solid samples. This include oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of Mars in order to distinguish between their geochemical or biological origin.

* Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD): This instrument was the first of ten MSL instruments to be turned on. Both en route and on the planet&#x27;s surface, it will characterize the broad spectrum of radiation encountered in the Martian environment. Turned on after launch, it recorded several radiation spikes caused by the Sun. On May 31, 2013, NASA scientists reported that a possible human mission to Mars may involve a great radiation risk based on the amount of energetic particle radiation detected by the RAD on the Mars Science Laboratory while traveling from the Earth to Mars in 2011–2012.

* Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN): A pulsed neutron source and detector for measuring hydrogen or ice and water at or near the Martian surface. On August 18, 2012 (sol ) the Russian science instrument, DAN, was turned on, marking the success of a Russian-American collaboration on the surface of Mars and the first working Russian science instrument on the Martian surface since Mars 3 stopped transmitting over forty years ago. The instrument is designed to detect subsurface water.
* Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS): Meteorological package and an ultraviolet sensor provided by Spain and Finland. It measures humidity, pressure, temperatures, wind speeds, and ultraviolet radiation.
* Cameras: &quot;Curiosity&quot; has seventeen cameras overall. 12 engineering cameras (Hazcams and Navcams) and five science cameras. MAHLI, MARDI, and MastCam cameras were developed by Malin Space Science Systems and they all share common design components, such as on-board electronic imaging processing boxes, 1600×1200 CCDs, and a RGB Bayer pattern filter.
** MastCam: This system provides multiple spectra and true-color imaging with two cameras.
** Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI): This system consists of a camera mounted to a robotic arm on the rover, used to acquire microscopic images of rock and soil. It has white and ultraviolet LEDs for illumination.
* ChemCam: Designed by Roger Wiens is a system of remote sensing instruments used to erode the Martian surface up to 10 meters away and measure the different components that make up the land. The payload includes the first laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) system to be used for planetary science, and &quot;Curiosity&quot; fifth science camera, the remote micro-imager (RMI). The RMI provides black-and-white images at 1024×1024 resolution in a 0.02 radian (1.1-degree) field of view. This is approximately equivalent to a 1500 mm lens on a 35 mm camera.

* Mars Descent Imager (MARDI): During part of the descent to the Martian surface, MARDI acquired 4 color images per second, at 1600×1200 pixels, with a 0.9-millisecond exposure time. Images were taken 4 times per second, starting shortly before heatshield separation at 3.7 km altitude, until a few seconds after touchdown. This provided engineering information about both the motion of the rover during the descent process, and science information about the terrain immediately surrounding the rover. NASA descoped MARDI in 2007, but Malin Space Science Systems contributed it with its own resources. After landing it could take per pixel views of the surface, the first of these post-landing photos were taken by August 27, 2012 (sol ).
* Engineering cameras: There are 12 additional cameras that support mobility:
** Hazard avoidance cameras (Hazcams): The rover has a pair of black and white navigation cameras (Hazcams) located on each of its four corners. These provide closed-up views of potential obstacles about to go under the wheels.
** Navigation cameras (Navcams): The rover uses two pairs of black and white navigation cameras mounted on the mast to support ground navigation. These provide a longer-distance view of the terrain ahead.

== History ==

The Mars Science Laboratory was recommended by United States National Research Council Decadal Survey committee as the top priority middle-class Mars mission in 2003. NASA called for proposals for the rover&#x27;s scientific instruments in April 2004, and eight proposals were selected on December 14 of that year. Testing and design of components also began in late 2004, including Aerojet&#x27;s designing of a monopropellant engine with the ability to throttle from 15 to 100 percent thrust with a fixed propellant inlet pressure.

=== Cost overruns, delays, and launch ===
By November 2008 most hardware and software development was complete, and testing continued. At this point, cost overruns were approximately $400 million. In the attempts to meet the launch date, several instruments and a cache for samples were removed and other instruments and cameras were simplified to simplify testing and integration of the rover. The next month, NASA delayed the launch to late 2011 because of inadequate testing time. Eventually the costs for developing the rover reached $2.47 billion, that for a rover that initially had been classified as a medium-cost mission with a maximum budget of $650 million, yet NASA still had to ask for an additional $82 million to meet the planned November launch. As of 2012, the project suffered an 84 percent overrun.

MSL launched on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011. On January 11, 2012, the spacecraft successfully refined its trajectory with a three-hour series of thruster-engine firings, advancing the rover&#x27;s landing time by about 14 hours. When MSL was launched, the program&#x27;s director was Doug McCuistion of NASA&#x27;s Planetary Science Division.

&quot;Curiosity&quot; successfully landed in the Gale Crater at 05:17:57.3 UTC on August 6, 2012, and transmitted Hazcam images confirming orientation. Due to the Mars-Earth distance at the time of landing and the limited speed of radio signals, the landing was not registered on Earth for another 14 minutes. The &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; sent a photograph of &quot;Curiosity&quot; descending under its parachute, taken by its HiRISE camera, during the landing procedure.

Six senior members of the &quot;Curiosity&quot; team presented a news conference a few hours after landing, they were: John Grunsfeld, NASA associate administrator; Charles Elachi, director, JPL; Peter Theisinger, MSL project manager; Richard Cook, MSL deputy project manager; Adam Steltzner, MSL entry, descent and landing (EDL) lead; and John Grotzinger, MSL project scientist.

=== Naming ===
Between March 23 and 29, 2009, the general public ranked nine finalist rover names (Adventure, Amelia, Journey, Perception, Pursuit, Sunrise, Vision, Wonder, and Curiosity) through a public poll on the NASA website. On May 27, 2009, the winning name was announced to be &quot;Curiosity&quot;. The name had been submitted in an essay contest by Clara Ma, a sixth-grader from Kansas.

=== Landing site selection ===

Over 60 landing sites were evaluated, and by July 2011 Gale crater was chosen. A primary goal when selecting the landing site was to identify a particular geologic environment, or set of environments, that would support microbial life. Planners looked for a site that could contribute to a wide variety of possible science objectives. They preferred a landing site with both morphologic and mineralogical evidence for past water. Furthermore, a site with spectra indicating multiple hydrated minerals was preferred; clay minerals and sulfate salts would constitute a rich site. Hematite, other iron oxides, sulfate minerals, silicate minerals, silica, and possibly chloride minerals were suggested as possible substrates for fossil preservation. Indeed, all are known to facilitate the preservation of fossil morphologies and molecules on Earth. Difficult terrain was favored for finding evidence of livable conditions, but the rover must be able to safely reach the site and drive within it.

Engineering constraints called for a landing site less than 45° from the Martian equator, and less than 1 km above the reference datum. At the first MSL Landing Site workshop, 33 potential landing sites were identified. By the end of the second workshop in late 2007, the list was reduced to six; in November 2008, project leaders at a third workshop reduced the list to these four landing sites:

A fourth landing site workshop was held in late September 2010, and the fifth and final workshop May 16–18, 2011. On July 22, 2011, it was announced that Gale Crater had been selected as the landing site of the Mars Science Laboratory mission.

== Launch ==
=== Launch vehicle ===
The Atlas V launch vehicle is capable of launching up to to geostationary transfer orbit. The Atlas V was also used to launch the &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; and the &quot;New Horizons&quot; probe.

The first and second stages, along with the solid rocket motors, were stacked on October 9, 2011, near the launch pad. The fairing containing MSL was transported to the launch pad on November 3, 2011.

=== Launch event ===
MSL was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 on November 26, 2011, at 15:02 UTC via the Atlas V 541 provided by United Launch Alliance. This two stage rocket includes a Common Core Booster (CCB) powered by one RD-180 engine, four solid rocket boosters (SRB), and one Centaur second stage with a diameter payload fairing. The NASA Launch Services Program coordinated the launch via the NASA Launch Services (NLS) I Contract.

== Cruise ==
=== Cruise stage ===
The cruise stage carried the MSL spacecraft through the void of space and delivered it to Mars. The interplanetary trip covered the distance of 352 million miles in 253 days. The cruise stage has its own miniature propulsion system, consisting of eight thrusters using hydrazine fuel in two titanium tanks. It also has its own electric power system, consisting of a solar array and battery for providing continuous power. Upon reaching Mars, the spacecraft stopped spinning and a cable cutter separated the cruise stage from the aeroshell. Then the cruise stage was diverted into a separate trajectory into the atmosphere. In December 2012, the debris field from the cruise stage was located by the &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;. Since the initial size, velocity, density and impact angle of the hardware are known, it will provide information on impact processes on the Mars surface and atmospheric properties.

=== Mars transfer orbit ===
The MSL spacecraft departed Earth orbit and was inserted into a heliocentric Mars transfer orbit on November 26, 2011, shortly after launch, by the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V launch vehicle. Prior to Centaur separation, the spacecraft was spin-stabilized at 2 rpm for attitude control during the cruise to Mars.

During cruise, eight thrusters arranged in two clusters were used as actuators to control spin rate and perform axial or lateral trajectory correction maneuvers. By spinning about its central axis, it maintained a stable attitude. Along the way, the cruise stage performed four trajectory correction maneuvers to adjust the spacecraft&#x27;s path toward its landing site. Information was sent to mission controllers via two X-band antennas. A key task of the cruise stage was to control the temperature of all spacecraft systems and dissipate the heat generated by power sources, such as solar cells and motors, into space. In some systems, insulating blankets kept sensitive science instruments warmer than the near-absolute zero temperature of space. Thermostats monitored temperatures and switched heating and cooling systems on or off as needed.

== Entry, descent and landing (EDL) ==

=== EDL spacecraft system ===

Landing a large mass on Mars is particularly challenging as the atmosphere is too thin for parachutes and aerobraking alone to be effective, while remaining thick enough to create stability and impingement problems when decelerating with retrorockets. Although some previous missions have used airbags to cushion the shock of landing, the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover is too heavy for this to be an option. Instead, &quot;Curiosity&quot; was set down on the Martian surface using a new high-accuracy entry, descent, and landing (EDL) system that was part of the MSL spacecraft descent stage. The mass of this EDL system, including parachute, sky crane, fuel and aeroshell, is . The novel EDL system placed &quot;Curiosity&quot; within a landing ellipse, in contrast to the landing ellipse of the landing systems used by the Mars Exploration Rovers.

The entry-descent-landing (EDL) system differs from those used for other missions in that it does not require an interactive, ground-generated mission plan. During the entire landing phase, the vehicle acts autonomously, based on pre-loaded software and parameters. The EDL system was based on a Viking-derived aeroshell structure and propulsion system for a precision guided entry and soft landing, in contrasts with the airbag landings that were used in the mid-1990s by the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions. The spacecraft employed several systems in a precise order, with the entry, descent and landing sequence broken down into four parts—described below as the spaceflight events unfolded on August 6, 2012.

=== EDL event–August 6, 2012 ===

Despite its late hour, particularly on the east coast of the United States where it was 1:31 a.m., the landing generated significant public interest. 3.2 million watched the landing live with most watching online instead of on television via NASA TV or cable news networks covering the event live. The final landing place for the rover was less than from its target after a journey. In addition to streaming and traditional video viewing, JPL made Eyes on the Solar System, a three-dimensional real time simulation of entry, descent and landing based on real data. &quot;Curiosity&quot; touchdown time as represented in the software, based on JPL predictions, was less than 1 second different from reality.

The EDL phase of the MSL spaceflight mission to Mars took only seven minutes and unfolded automatically, as programmed by JPL engineers in advance, in a precise order, with the entry, descent and landing sequence occurring in four distinct event phases:

==== Guided entry ====

Precision guided entry made use of onboard computing ability to steer itself toward the pre-determined landing site, improving landing accuracy from a range of hundreds of kilometers to . This capability helped remove some of the uncertainties of landing hazards that might be present in larger landing ellipses. Steering was achieved by the combined use of thrusters and ejectable balance masses. The ejectable balance masses shift the capsule center of mass enabling generation of a lift vector during the atmospheric phase. A navigation computer integrated the measurements to estimate the position and attitude of the capsule that generated automated torque commands. This was the first planetary mission to use precision landing techniques.

The rover was folded up within an aeroshell that protected it during the travel through space and during the atmospheric entry at Mars. Ten minutes before atmospheric entry the aeroshell separated from the cruise stage that provided power, communications and propulsion during the long flight to Mars. One minute after separation from the cruise stage thrusters on the aeroshell fired to cancel out the spacecraft&#x27;s 2-rpm rotation and achieved an orientation with the heat shield facing Mars in preparation for Atmospheric entry. The heat shield is made of phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA). The diameter heat shield, which is the largest heat shield ever flown in space, reduced the velocity of the spacecraft by ablation against the Martian atmosphere, from the atmospheric interface velocity of approximately down to approximately , where parachute deployment was possible about four minutes later. One minute and 15 seconds after entry the heat shield experienced peak temperatures of up to as atmospheric pressure converted kinetic energy into heat. Ten seconds after peak heating, that deceleration peaked out at 15 g.

Much of the reduction of the landing precision error was accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, derived from the algorithm used for guidance of the Apollo Command Modules returning to Earth in the Apollo program. This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to &quot;fly out&quot; any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the axial centerline that results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight. This was accomplished by ejecting ballast masses consisting of two tungsten weights minutes before atmospheric entry. The lift vector was controlled by four sets of two reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that produced approximately of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allowed the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone. Prior to parachute deployment the entry vehicle ejected more ballast mass consisting of six tungsten weights such that the center of gravity offset was removed.

==== Parachute descent ====
When the entry phase was complete and the capsule slowed to about at about altitude, the supersonic parachute deployed, as was done by previous landers such as Viking, Mars Pathfinder and the Mars Exploration Rovers. The parachute has 80 suspension lines, is over long, and is about in diameter. Capable of being deployed at Mach 2.2, the parachute can generate up to of drag force in the Martian atmosphere. After the parachute was deployed, the heat shield separated and fell away. A camera beneath the rover acquired about 5 frames per second (with resolution of 1600×1200 pixels) below during a period of about 2 minutes until the rover sensors confirmed successful landing. The &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; team were able to acquire an image of the MSL descending under the parachute.

==== Powered descent ====

Following the parachute braking, at about altitude, still travelling at about , the rover and descent stage dropped out of the aeroshell. The descent stage is a platform above the rover with eight variable thrust monopropellant hydrazine rocket thrusters on arms extending around this platform to slow the descent. Each rocket thruster, called a Mars Lander Engine (MLE), produces of thrust and were derived from those used on the Viking landers. A radar altimeter measured altitude and velocity, feeding data to the rover&#x27;s flight computer. Meanwhile, the rover transformed from its stowed flight configuration to a landing configuration while being lowered beneath the descent stage by the &quot;sky crane&quot; system.

==== Sky crane ====


For several reasons, a different landing system was chosen for MSL compared to previous Mars landers and rovers. &quot;Curiosity&quot; was considered too heavy to use the airbag landing system as used on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rovers. A legged lander approach would have caused several design problems. It would have needed to have engines high enough above the ground when landing not to form a dust cloud that could damage the rover&#x27;s instruments. This would have required long landing legs that would need to have significant width to keep the center of gravity low. A legged lander would have also required ramps so the rover could drive down to the surface, which would have incurred extra risk to the mission on the chance rocks or tilt would prevent &quot;Curiosity&quot; from being able to drive off the lander successfully. Faced with these challenges, the MSL engineers came up with a novel alternative solution: the sky crane. The sky crane system lowered the rover with a tether to a soft landing—wheels down—on the surface of Mars. This system consists of a bridle lowering the rover on three nylon tethers and an electrical cable carrying information and power between the descent stage and rover. As the support and data cables unreeled, the rover&#x27;s six motorized wheels snapped into position. At roughly below the descent stage the sky crane system slowed to a halt and the rover touched down. After the rover touched down, it waited two seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground by detecting the weight on the wheels and fired several pyros (small explosive devices) activating cable cutters on the bridle and umbilical cords to free itself from the descent stage. The descent stage then flew away to a crash landing away. The sky crane concept had never been used in missions before.

=== Landing site ===

Gale Crater is the MSL landing site. Within Gale Crater is a mountain, named Aeolis Mons (&quot;Mount Sharp&quot;), of layered rocks, rising about above the crater floor, that &quot;Curiosity&quot; will investigate. The landing site is a smooth region in &quot;Yellowknife&quot; &quot;Quad 51&quot; of Aeolis Palus inside the crater in front of the mountain. The target landing site location was an elliptical area . Gale Crater&#x27;s diameter is .

The landing location for the rover was less than from the center of the planned landing ellipse, after a journey. NASA named the rover landing site Bradbury Landing on sol , August 22, 2012. According to NASA, an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 heat-resistant bacterial spores were on &quot;Curiosity&quot; at launch, and as much as 1,000 times that number may not have been counted.

<doc id="453551" wikidata="Q244451" url="?curid=453551" title="Amazon basin">
<text>The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about , or about 35.5 percent of the South American continent. It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela, as well as the territory of French Guiana.

Most of the basin is covered by the Amazon rainforest, also known as Amazonia. With a area of dense tropical forest, it is the largest rainforest in the world.

== Geography ==
The Amazon River begins in the Andes Mountains at the west of the basin with its main tributary the Marañón River and Apurimac River in Peru. The highest point in the watershed of the Amazon is the second biggest peak of Yerupajá at .

The Amazon River Basin occupies the entire central and eastern area of South America, lying to the east of the Andes mountain range and extending from the Guyana Plateau in the north to the Brazilian Plateau in the south.

With a length of about before it drains into the Atlantic Ocean, it is one of the two longest rivers in the world. A team of scientists has claimed that the Amazon is longer than the Nile, but debate about its exact length continues.

The Amazon system transports the largest volume of water of any river system, accounting for about 20% of the total water carried to the oceans by rivers. Some of the Amazon rainforests are deforested because of an increase in cattle ranches and soybean fields. The Amazon basin formerly flowed west to the Pacific Ocean until the Andes formed, causing the basin to flow eastward towards the Atlantic Ocean.

Politically the basin is divided into Peruvian Amazonia, Amazônia Legal of Brazil, the Amazon natural region of Colombia, Amazonas (Venezuelan state), and parts of Bolivia and Ecuador.

== Plant life ==
Plant growth is quite dense and its variety of animal inhabitants is comparatively high due to the heavy rainfall and the dense and extensive evergreen and coniferous forests. Little sunlight reaches the ground due to the dense roof of canopy by plants. The ground remains dark and damp and only shade-tolerant vegetation will grow here. Orchids and bromeliads exploit trees and other plants to get closer to the sunlight. They grow hanging onto the branches or tree trunks with aerial roots, not as parasites but as epiphytes. Species of tropical trees native to the Amazon include Brazil nut, rubber tree and Assai palm.

== Wildlife ==
=== Mammals ===
More than 1,400 species of mammals are found in the Amazon, the majority of which are species of bats and rodents. Its larger mammals include the jaguar, ocelot, capybara, puma and South American tapir.

=== Birds ===
About 1,500 bird species inhabit the Amazon basin. The biodiversity of the Amazon and the sheer number of diverse bird species is given by the number of different bird families that reside in these humid forests. An example of such would be the cotinga family, to which the Guianan cock-of-the-rock belong. Birds such as toucans, and hummingbirds are also found here. Macaws are famous for duck gathering by the hundreds along the clay cliffs of the Amazon River. In the western Amazon hundreds of macaws and other parrots descend to exposed river banks to consume clay on an almost daily basis, the exception being rainy days.

=== Reptiles ===
The green anaconda inhabits the shallow waters of the Amazon and the emerald tree boa and boa constrictor live in the Amazonian tree tops.

Many reptile species are illegally collected and exported for the international pet trade. Live animals are the fourth largest commodity in the smuggling industry after drugs, diamonds and weapons.

=== Amphibians ===
More than 1,500 species of amphibians swim and are found in the Amazon. Unlike temperate frogs which are mostly limited to habitats near the water, tropical frogs are most abundant in the trees and relatively few are found near bodies of water on the forest floor. The reason for this occurrence is quite simple: frogs must always keep their skin moist since almost half of their respiration is carried out through their skin. The high humidity of the rainforest and frequent rainstorms gives tropical frogs infinitely more freedom to move into the trees and escape the many predators of rainforest waters. The differences between temperate and tropical frogs extend beyond their habitat.

=== Fish ===
About 2,500 fish species are known from the Amazon basin and it is estimated that more than 1,000 additional undescribed species exist. This is more than any other river basin on Earth, and Amazonia is the center of diversity for Neotropical fishes. About 45% (more than 1,000 species) of the known Amazonian fish species are endemic to the basin. The remarkable species richness can in part be explained by the large differences between the various parts of the Amazon basin, resulting in many fish species that are endemic to small regions. For example, fauna in clearwater rivers differs from fauna in white and blackwater rivers, fauna in slow moving sections show distinct differences compared to that in rapids, fauna in small streams differ from that in major rivers, and fauna in shallow sections show distinct differences compared to that in deep parts. By far the most diverse orders in the Amazon are Characiformes (43% of total fish species in the Amazon) and Siluriformes (39%), but other groups with many species include Cichlidae (6%) and Gymnotiformes (3%).

In addition to major differences in behavior and ecology, Amazonian fish vary extensively in form and size. The largest, the arapaima and piraiba can reach or more in length and up to in weight, making them some of the largest strict freshwater fish in the world. The bull shark and common sawfish, which have been recorded far up the Amazon, may reach even greater sizes, but they are euryhaline and often seen in marine waters. In contrast to the giants, there are Amazonian fish from several families that are less than long. The smallest are likely the &quot;Leptophilypnion&quot; sleeper gobies, which do not surpass and are among the smallest fish in the world.

The Amazon supports very large fisheries, including well-known species of large catfish (such as &quot;Brachyplatystoma&quot;, which perform long breeding migrations up the Amazon), arapaima and tambaqui, and is also home to many species that are important in the aquarium trade, such as the oscar, discus, angelfish, &quot;Corydoras&quot; catfish and neon tetra. Although the true danger they represent often is greatly exaggerated, the Amazon basin is home to several feared fish species such as piranhas (including the famous red-bellied), electric eel, river stingrays and candiru.

Several cavefish species in the genus &quot;Phreatobius&quot; are found in the Amazon, as is the cave-dwelling &quot;Astroblepus pholeter&quot; in the far western part of the basin (Andean region). The Tocantins basin, arguably not part of the Amazon basin, has several other cavefish species. The deeper part of the major Amazonian rivers are always dark and a few species have adaptions similar to cavefish (reduced pigment and eyes). Among these are the knifefish &quot;Compsaraia&quot; and &quot;Orthosternarchus&quot;, some &quot;Cetopsis&quot; whale catfish (especially &quot;C. oliveirai&quot;), some &quot;Xyliphius&quot; and &quot;Micromyzon&quot; banjo catfish, and the loricariid catfish &quot;Loricaria spinulifera&quot;, &quot;L. pumila&quot;, &quot;Peckoltia pankimpuju&quot;, &quot;Panaque bathyphilus&quot; and &quot;Panaqolus nix&quot; (these five also occur in &quot;normal&quot; forms of shallower waters). The perhaps most unusual habitat used by Amazonian fish is land. The splash tetra is famous for laying its eggs on plants above water, keeping them moist by continuously splashing on them, the South American lungfish can survive underground in a mucous cocoon during the dry season, some small rivulid killifish can jump over land between water sources (sometimes moving relatively long distances, even uphill) and may deliberately jump onto land to escape aquatic predators, and an undescribed species of worm-like &quot;Phreatobius&quot; catfish lives in waterlogged leaf litter near (not in) streams.

Some of the major fish groups of the Amazon basin include:
* Order Gymnotiformes: Neotropical electric fishes
* Order Characiformes: characins, tetras and relatives
* Family Potamotrygonidae: river stingrays
* Family Arapaimidae: bonytongues
* Family Loricariidae: suckermouth catfishes
* Family Callichthyidae: armored catfishes
* Family Pimelodidae: pimelodid catfishes
* Family Trichomycteridae: pencil catfishes
* Family Auchenipteridae: driftwood catfishes
* Subfamily Cichlinae: pike cichlids, peacock cichlids and relatives
* Subfamily Geophaginae: Eartheaters and Neotropical dwarf cichlid
* Subfamily Poeciliinae: guppies and relatives

=== Insects ===
More than 90% of the animal species in the Amazon are insects, of which about 40% are beetles (Coleoptera constituting almost 25% of all known types of animal life-forms.)

Whereas all of Europe has some 321 butterfly species, the Manú National Park in Peru (4,000 hectare-survey) has 2,300 species, while Tambopata National Reserve (5,500 hectare-survey) has at least 1,231 species.

== Climate ==
The Amazon River basin has a low-water season (known popularly as summer), and a wet season (known popularly as winter) during which, the rivers flood the adjacent, low-lying forests. The climate of the basin is generally hot and humid. In some areas, however, the summer months (June–September) can bring cold snaps, fueled by Antarctic winds traveling along the adjacent mountain range. The average annual temperature is around 25-degree and 28 
degree Celsius with little to no distinction between summer and winter season.

== Human lifestyle ==
Amazonia is scarcely populated. There are scattered settlements inland, but most of the population lives in a few larger cities on the banks of the Amazon and other major rivers, such as in Iquitos – Loreto in Peru, Manaus-Amazonas State, and Belém, Pará. In many regions, the forest has been cleared for soya bean plantations and ranching (the most extensive non-forest use of the land); some of the inhabitants harvest wild rubber latex, and Brazilian nuts. This is a form of extractive farms, where the trees are not cut down. These are relatively sustainable operations in contrast to lumbering or agriculture dependent on clearing the rainforest. The people live in thatched houses shaped liked beehives. They also build apartment-like houses called &quot;Maloca&quot;, with a steeply slanting roof.

== Languages ==
The most widely spoken languages in the Amazon are Portuguese and Spanish. There are hundreds of native languages still spoken in the Amazon, most of which are critically endangered.

== Indigenous peoples ==
Many tribal groups live in the Amazon Basin, often in relative isolation. It is estimated 400 or more tribal groups have lived in the Amazon Basin for hundreds of years with their own culture, language, and lifestyle. Today total population of Amazon basin is 1.5 million distributed. There are an estimated 100 uncontacted tribal groups.
The largest organization fighting for the indigenous peoples in this area is COICA. It is a supra organization encompassing all indigenous rights organizations working in the Amazon basin area, and covers the people living in several countries.

== River commerce ==
The river is the principal path of transportation for people and produce in the regions, with transport ranging from balsa rafts and dugout canoes to hand built wooden river craft and modern steel hulled craft.

== Agriculture ==
Seasonal floods excavate and redistribute nutrient-rich silt onto beaches and islands, enabling dry-season riverside agriculture of rice, beans, and corn on the river&#x27;s shoreline without the addition of fertilizer, with additional slash and burn agriculture on higher floodplains. Fishing provides additional food year-round, and free-range chickens need little or no food beyond what they can forage locally. Charcoal made largely from forest and shoreline deadfall is produced for use in urban areas. Exploitation of bushmeat, particularly deer and turtles is common.
Extensive deforestation, particularly in Brazil, is leading to the extinction of known and unknown species, reducing biological diversity and adversely impacting soil, water, and air quality. A final part of the deforestation process is the large-scale production of charcoal for industrial processes such as steel manufacturing. Soils within the region are generally shallow and cannot be used for more than a few seasons without the addition of imported fertilizers and chemicals.

== Global ecological role / Function for climate change ==
&quot;Over past 20 years (2021), the Brazilian Amazon emitted 13% more CO2 than it absorbed&quot;.
&quot;Amazon biodiversity also plays a critical role as part of global systems, influencing the global carbon cycle and thus climate change, as well as hemispheric hydrological systems, serving as an important anchor for South American climate and rainfall. It also produces 20% oxygen of the Earth.&quot;

<text>Green Bank is a census-designated place in Pocahontas County in West Virginia&#x27;s Potomac Highlands inside the Allegheny Mountain Range. Green Bank is located along WV 28. Green Bank is home to the Green Bank Observatory and is also close to the Snowshoe Mountain ski resort. As of the 2020 census, its population was 141.

The community was named for a green riverbank near the original town site.

==National Radio Quiet Zone==

Green Bank is located within the National Radio Quiet Zone, which means that radio transmissions are heavily restricted by law. This policy is enforced by a &quot;radio policeman&quot; who uses specialized equipment to detect signals from unauthorized electronics. Green Bank is home to the Green Bank Telescope, the world&#x27;s largest fully steerable radio telescope, which was operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) until September 30, 2016. Since October 1, 2016, the Telescope has been operated by the Green Bank Observatory, which is no longer part of the NRAO. It was at the Green Bank Site in 1961 that Frank Drake presented the Drake Equation, which was developed to provide an estimate of the total number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.

As Green Bank is located within the National Radio Quiet Zone, many people who believe they suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, a disputed medical condition, are finding new homes within its borders. Escape from cellular radiation is the main attraction to Green Bank for these people. , around 30 people had moved to Green Bank to escape the supposed effects of electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

<text>Phoenix was an uncrewed space probe that landed on the surface of Mars on May 25, 2008, and operated until November 2, 2008. &quot;Phoenix&quot; was operational on Mars for sols ( days). Its instruments were used to assess the local habitability and to research the history of water on Mars. The mission was part of the Mars Scout Program; its total cost was $420 million, including the cost of launch.

The multi-agency program was led by the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, with project management by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Academic and industrial partners included universities in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, NASA, the Canadian Space Agency, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, Lockheed Martin Space Systems, MacDonald Dettwiler &amp; Associates (MDA) in partnership with Optech Incorporated (Optech) and other aerospace companies. It was the first NASA mission to Mars led by a public university.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was NASA&#x27;s sixth successful landing on Mars, from seven attempts, and the first in Mars&#x27; polar region. The lander completed its mission in August 2008, and made a last brief communication with Earth on November 2 as available solar power dropped with the Martian winter. The mission was declared concluded on November 10, 2008, after engineers were unable to re-contact the craft. After unsuccessful attempts to contact the lander by the &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; orbiter up to and past the Martian summer solstice on May 12, 2010, JPL declared the lander to be dead. The program was considered a success because it completed all planned science experiments and observations.

==Mission overview==
The mission had two goals. One was to study the geological history of water, the key to unlocking the story of past climate change. The second was to evaluate past or potential planetary habitability in the ice-soil boundary. &quot;Phoenix&quot;&#x27;s instruments were suitable for uncovering information on the geological and possibly biological history of the Martian Arctic. &quot;Phoenix&quot; was the first mission to return data from either of the poles, and contributed to NASA&#x27;s main strategy for Mars exploration, &quot;Follow the water.&quot;

The primary mission was anticipated to last 90 sols (Martian days)—just over 92 Earth days. However, the craft exceeded its expected operational lifetime by a little over two months before succumbing to the increasing cold and dark of an advancing Martian winter. Researchers had hoped that the lander would survive into the Martian winter so that it could witness polar ice developing around it – perhaps up to of solid carbon dioxide ice could have appeared. Even had it survived some of the winter, the intense cold would have prevented it from lasting all the way through. The mission was chosen to be a fixed lander rather than a rover because:
* costs were reduced through reuse of earlier equipment (though this claim is disputed by some observers);
* the area of Mars where &quot;Phoenix&quot; landed is thought to be relatively uniform, thus traveling on the surface is of less value; and
* the weight budget needed for mobility could instead be used for more and better scientific instruments.

The 2003–2004 observations of methane gas on Mars were made remotely by three teams working with separate data. If the methane is truly present in the atmosphere of Mars, then something must be producing it on the planet now, because the gas is broken down by radiation on Mars within 300 years; therefore, it was considered important to determine the biological potential or habitability of the Martian arctic&#x27;s soils. Methane could also be the product of a geochemical process or the result of volcanic or hydrothermal activity.

===History===
While the proposal for &quot;Phoenix&quot; was being written, the &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; orbiter used its gamma-ray spectrometer and found the distinctive signature of hydrogen on some areas of the Martian surface, and the only plausible source of hydrogen on Mars would be water in the form of ice, frozen below the surface. The mission was therefore funded on the expectation that &quot;Phoenix&quot; would find water ice on the arctic plains of Mars. In August 2003 NASA selected the University of Arizona &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission for launch in 2007. It was hoped this would be the first in a new line of smaller, low-cost, Scout missions in the agency&#x27;s exploration of Mars program. The selection was the result of an intense two-year competition with proposals from other institutions. The $325 million NASA award is more than six times larger than any other single research grant in University of Arizona history.

Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, as Principal Investigator, along with 24 Co-Investigators, were selected to lead the mission. The mission was named after the Phoenix, a mythological bird that is repeatedly reborn from its own ashes. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; spacecraft contains several previously built components. The lander used was the modified Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander (canceled in 2000), along with several of the instruments from both that and the previous unsuccessful Mars Polar Lander mission. Lockheed Martin, who built the lander, had kept the nearly complete lander in an environmentally controlled clean room from 2001 until the mission was funded by the NASA Scout Program.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was a partnership of universities, NASA centers, and the aerospace industry. The science instruments and operations were a University of Arizona responsibility. NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, managed the project and provided mission design and control. Lockheed Martin Space Systems built and tested the spacecraft. The Canadian Space Agency provided a meteorological station, including an innovative laser-based atmospheric sensor. The co-investigator institutions included Malin Space Science Systems (California), Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (Germany), NASA Ames Research Center (California), NASA Johnson Space Center (Texas), MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (Canada), Optech Incorporated (Canada), SETI Institute, Texas A&amp;M University, Tufts University, University of Colorado, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), University of Michigan, University of Neuchâtel (Switzerland), University of Texas at Dallas, University of Washington, Washington University in St. Louis, and York University (Canada). Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Bristol provided hardware for the mission and were part of the team operating the microscope station.

On June 2, 2005, following a critical review of the project&#x27;s planning progress and preliminary design, NASA approved the mission to proceed as planned. The purpose of the review was to confirm NASA&#x27;s confidence in the mission.

===Specifications===

;Launched mass
: Includes Lander, Aeroshell (backshell and heatshield), parachutes, cruise stage.
;Lander Mass
;Lander Dimensions
:About long with the solar panels deployed. The science deck by itself is about in diameter. From the ground to the top of the MET mast, the lander measures about tall.
;Communications
:X-band throughout the cruise phase of the mission and for its initial communication after separating from the third stage of the launch vehicle. UHF links, relayed through Mars orbiters during the entry, descent and landing phase and while operating on the surface of Mars. The UHF system on &quot;Phoenix&quot; is compatible with relay capabilities of NASA&#x27;s Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and with the European Space Agency&#x27;s Mars Express. The interconnections use the Proximity-1 protocol.
;Power
:Power for the cruise phase is generated using two decagonal gallium arsenide solar panels (total area ) mounted to the cruise stage, and for the lander, via two gallium arsenide solar array panels (total area ) deployed from the lander after touchdown on the Martian surface. NiH2 battery with a capacity of 16 A·h.

Lander systems include a RAD6000 based computer system for commanding the spacecraft and handling data. Other parts of the lander are an electrical system containing solar arrays and batteries, a guidance system to land the spacecraft, eight and monopropellant hydrazine engines built by Aerojet-Redmond Operations for the cruise phase, twelve Aerojet monopropellant hydrazine thrusters to land the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, mechanical and structural elements, and a heater system to ensure the spacecraft does not get too cold.

==Scientific payload==
&quot;Phoenix&quot; carried improved versions of University of Arizona panoramic cameras and volatiles-analysis instrument from the ill-fated Mars Polar Lander, as well as experiments that had been built for the canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander, including a JPL trench-digging robotic arm, a set of wet chemistry laboratories, and optical and atomic force microscopes. The science payload also included a descent imager and a suite of meteorological instruments.

During EDL, the Atmospheric Structure Experiment was conducted. This used accelerometer and gyroscope data recorded during the lander&#x27;s descent through the atmosphere to create a vertical profile of the temperature, pressure, and density of the atmosphere above the landing site, at that point in time.

===Robotic arm and camera===
The robotic arm was designed to extend from its base on the lander, and had the ability to dig down to below a sandy surface. It took samples of dirt and ice that were analyzed by other instruments on the lander. The arm was designed and built for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by &quot;Alliance Spacesystems, LLC&quot; (now Maxar Space Robotics, LLC) in Pasadena, California. A rotating rasp-tool located in the heel of the scoop was used to cut into the strong permafrost. Cuttings from the rasp were ejected into the heel of the scoop and transferred to the front for delivery to the instruments. The rasp tool was conceived of at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The flight version of the rasp was designed and built by HoneyBee Robotics. Commands were sent for the arm to be deployed on May 28, 2008, beginning with the pushing aside of a protective covering intended to serve as a redundant precaution against potential contamination of Martian soil by Earthly life-forms.
The Robotic Arm Camera (RAC) attached to the robotic arm just above the scoop was able to take full-color pictures of the area, as well as verify the samples that the scoop returned, and examined the grains of the area where the robotic arm had just dug. The camera was made by the University of Arizona and Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Germany.

===Surface stereo imager===
The Surface Stereo Imager (SSI) was the primary camera on the lander. It is a stereo camera that is described as &quot;a higher resolution upgrade of the imager used for Mars Pathfinder and the Mars Polar Lander&quot;. It took several stereo images of the Martian Arctic, and also used the Sun as a reference to measure the atmospheric distortion of the Martian atmosphere due to dust, air and other features. The camera was provided by the University of Arizona in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research.

===Thermal and evolved gas analyzer===
The Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) is a combination of a high-temperature furnace with a mass spectrometer. It was used to bake samples of Martian dust and determine the composition of the resulting vapors. It has eight ovens, each about the size of a large ball-point pen, which were able to analyze one sample each, for a total of eight separate samples. Team members measured how much water vapor and carbon dioxide gas were given off, how much water ice the samples contained, and what minerals are present that may have formed during a wetter, warmer past climate. The instrument also measured organic volatiles, such as methane, down to 10 parts per billion. TEGA was built by the University of Arizona and University of Texas at Dallas.

On May 29, 2008 (sol ), electrical tests indicated an intermittent short circuit in TEGA, resulting from a glitch in one of the two filaments responsible for ionizing volatiles. NASA worked around the problem by configuring the backup filament as the primary and vice versa.

In early June, first attempts to get soil into TEGA were unsuccessful as it seemed too &quot;cloddy&quot; for the screens.
On June 11 the first of the eight ovens was filled with a soil sample after several tries to get the soil sample through the screen of TEGA. On June 17, it was announced that no water was found in this sample; however, since it had been exposed to the atmosphere for several days prior to entering the oven, any initial water ice it might have contained could have been lost via sublimation.

===Mars Descent Imager===
The Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) was intended to take pictures of the landing site during the last three minutes of descent. As originally planned, it would have begun taking pictures after the aeroshell departed, about above the Martian soil.

Before launch, testing of the assembled spacecraft uncovered a potential data corruption problem with an interface card that was designed to route MARDI image data as well as data from various other parts of the spacecraft. The potential problem could occur if the interface card were to receive a MARDI picture during a critical phase of the spacecraft&#x27;s final descent, at which point data from the spacecraft&#x27;s Inertial Measurement Unit could have been lost; this data was critical to controlling the descent and landing. This was judged to be an unacceptable risk, and it was decided to not use MARDI during the mission. As the flaw was discovered too late for repairs, the camera remained installed on &quot;Phoenix&quot; but it was not used to take pictures, nor was its built-in microphone used.

MARDI images had been intended to help pinpoint exactly where the lander landed, and possibly help find potential science targets. It was also to be used to learn if the area where the lander lands is typical of the surrounding terrain. MARDI was built by Malin Space Science Systems. It would have used only 3 watts of power during the imaging process, less than most other space cameras. It had originally been designed and built to perform the same function on the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander mission; after that mission was canceled, MARDI spent several years in storage until it was deployed on the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander.

===Microscopy, electrochemistry, and conductivity analyzer===
The Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) is an instrument package originally designed for the canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander mission. It consists of a wet chemistry lab (WCL), optical and atomic force microscopes, and a thermal and electrical conductivity probe. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory built MECA. A Swiss consortium led by the University of Neuchatel contributed the atomic force microscope.

Using MECA, researchers examined soil particles as small as 16 μm across; additionally, they attempted to determine the chemical composition of water-soluble ions in the soil. They also measured electrical and thermal conductivity of soil particles using a probe on the robotic arm scoop.

====Sample wheel and translation stage====
This instrument presents 6 of 69 sample holders to an opening in the MECA instrument to which the robotic arm delivers the samples and then brings the samples to the optical microscope and the atomic force microscope. Imperial College London provided the microscope sample substrates.

====Optical microscope====
The optical microscope, designed by the University of Arizona, is capable of making images of the Martian regolith with a resolution of 256 pixels/mm or 16 micrometers/pixel. The field of view of the microscope is a sample holder to which the robotic arm delivers the sample. The sample is illuminated either by 9 red, green and blue LEDs or by 3 LEDs emitting ultraviolet light. The electronics for the readout of the CCD chip are shared with the robotic arm camera which has an identical CCD chip.

====Atomic force microscope====
The atomic force microscope has access to a small area of the sample delivered to the optical microscope. The instrument scans over the sample with one of 8 silicon crystal tips and measures the repulsion of the tip from the sample. The maximum resolution is 0.1 micrometres. A Swiss consortium led by the University of Neuchatel contributed the atomic force microscope.

====Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL)====
The wet chemistry lab (WCL) sensor assembly and leaching solution were designed and built by Thermo Fisher Scientific. The WCL actuator assembly was designed and built by Starsys Research in Boulder, Colorado. Tufts University developed the reagent pellets, barium ISE, and ASV electrodes, and performed the preflight characterization of the sensor array.

The robotic arm scooped up some soil and put it in one of four wet chemistry lab cells, where water was added, and, while stirring, an array of electrochemical sensors measured a dozen dissolved ions such as sodium, magnesium, calcium, and sulfate that leached out from the soil into the water. This provided information on the biological compatibility of the soil, both for possible indigenous microbes and for possible future Earth visitors.

All of the four wet chemistry labs were identical, each containing 26 chemical sensors and a temperature sensor. The polymer Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE) were able to determine the concentration of ions by measuring the change in electric potential across their ion-selective membranes as a function of concentration. Two gas sensing electrodes for oxygen and carbon dioxide worked on the same principle but with gas-permeable membranes. A gold micro-electrode array was used for the cyclic voltammetry and anodic stripping voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry is a method to study ions by applying a waveform of varying potential and measuring the current–voltage curve. Anodic stripping voltammetry first deposits the metal ions onto the gold electrode with an applied potential. After the potential is reversed, the current is measured while the metals are stripped off the electrode.

====Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP)====
The MECA contains a Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP). The TECP, designed by Decagon Devices, has four probes that made the following measurements: Martian soil temperature, relative humidity, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity, wind speed, and atmospheric temperature.

Three of the four probes have tiny heating elements and temperature sensors inside them. One probe uses internal heating elements to send out a pulse of heat, recording the time the pulse is sent and monitoring the rate at which the heat is dissipated away from the probe. Adjacent needles sense when the heat pulse arrives. The speed that the heat travels away from the probe as well as the speed that it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity, specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and thermal diffusivity (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).

The probes also measured the dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity, which can be used to calculate moisture and salinity of the regolith. Needles 1 and 2 work in conjunction to measure salts in the regolith, heat the soil to measure thermal properties (thermal conductivity, specific heat and thermal diffusivity) of the regolith, and measure soil temperature. Needles 3 and 4 measure liquid water in the regolith. Needle 4 is a reference thermometer for needles 1 and 2.

The TECP humidity sensor is a relative humidity sensor, so it must be coupled with a temperature sensor in order to measure absolute humidity. Both the relative humidity sensor and a temperature sensor are attached directly to the circuit board of the TECP and are, therefore, assumed to be at the same temperature.

===Meteorological station===
The Meteorological Station (MET) recorded the daily weather of Mars during the course of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission. It is equipped with a wind indicator and pressure and temperature sensors. The MET also contains a lidar (light detection and ranging) device for sampling the number of dust particles in the air. It was designed in Canada by Optech and MDA, supported by the Canadian Space Agency. A team initially led by York University&#x27;s Professor Diane Michelangeli until her death in 2007, when Professor James Whiteway took over, oversaw the science operations of the station. The York University team includes contributions from the University of Alberta, University of Aarhus (Denmark), Dalhousie University, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Optech, and the Geological Survey of Canada. Canadarm maker MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) of Richmond, B.C. built the MET.


The surface wind velocity, pressure, and temperature were also monitored over the mission (from the tell-tale, pressure, and temperature sensors) and show the evolution of the atmosphere with time. To measure dust and ice contribution to the atmosphere, a lidar was employed. The lidar collected information about the time-dependent structure of the planetary boundary layer by investigating the vertical distribution of dust, ice, fog, and clouds in the local atmosphere.

There are three temperature sensors (thermocouples) on a vertical mast (shown in its stowed position) at heights of approximately above the lander deck. The sensors were referenced to a measurement of absolute temperature at the base of the mast. A pressure sensor built by Finnish Meteorological Institute is located in the Payload Electronics Box, which sits on the surface of the deck, and houses the acquisition electronics for the MET payload. The Pressure and Temperature sensors commenced operations on Sol 0 (May 26, 2008) and operated continuously, sampling once every 2 seconds.

The Telltale is a joint Canadian/Danish instrument (right) which provides a coarse estimate of wind speed and direction. The speed is based on the amount of deflection from vertical that is observed, while the wind direction is provided by which way this deflection occurs. A mirror, located under the telltale, and a calibration &quot;cross,&quot; above (as observed through the mirror) are employed to increase the accuracy of the measurement. Either camera, SSI or RAC, could make this measurement, though the former was typically used. Periodic observations both day and night aid in understanding the diurnal variability of wind at the &quot;Phoenix&quot; landing site.

The wind speeds ranged from . The usual average speed was .

The vertical-pointing lidar was capable of detecting multiple types of backscattering (for example Rayleigh scattering and Mie Scattering), with the delay between laser pulse generation and the return of light scattered by atmospheric particles determining the altitude at which scattering occurs. Additional information was obtained from backscattered light at different wavelengths (colors), and the &quot;Phoenix&quot; system transmitted both 532 nm and 1064 nm. Such wavelength dependence may make it possible to discriminate between ice and dust, and serve as an indicator of the effective particle size.

The &quot;Phoenix&quot; lidar&#x27;s laser was a passive Q-switched laser with the dual wavelengths of 1064 nm and 532 nm. It operated at 100 Hz with a pulse width of 10 ns. The scattered light was received by two detectors (green and IR) and the green signal was collected in both analog and photon counting modes.

The lidar was operated for the first time at noon on Sol 3 (May 29, 2008), recording the first surface extraterrestrial atmospheric profile. This first profile indicated well-mixed dust in the first few kilometers of the atmosphere of Mars, where the planetary boundary layer was observed by a marked decrease in scattering signal. The contour plot (right) shows the amount of dust as a function of time and altitude, with warmer colors (red, orange) indicating more dust, and cooler colors (blue, green), indicating less dust. There is also an instrumentation effect of the laser warming up, causing the appearance of dust increasing with time. A layer at can be observed in the plot, which could be extra dust, or—less likely, given the time of sol this was acquired—a low altitude ice cloud.

The image on the left shows the lidar laser operating on the surface of Mars, as observed by the SSI looking straight up; the laser beam is the nearly-vertical line just right of center. Overhead dust can be seen both moving in the background, as well as passing through the laser beam in the form of bright sparkles. The fact that the beam appears to terminate is the result of the extremely small angle at which the SSI is observing the laser—it sees farther up along the beam&#x27;s path than there is dust to reflect the light back down to it.

The laser device discovered snow falling from clouds; this was not known to occur before the mission. It was also determined that cirrus clouds formed in the area.

==Mission highlights==
=== Launch ===

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was launched on August 4, 2007, at 5:26:34 a.m. EDT (09:26:34 UTC) on a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle from Pad 17-A of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch was nominal with no significant anomalies. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander was placed on a trajectory of such precision that its first trajectory course correction burn, performed on August 10, 2007, at 7:30 a.m. EDT (11:30 UTC), was only 18 m/s. The launch took place during a launch window extending from August 3, 2007, to August 24, 2007. Due to the small launch window, the rescheduled launch of the &quot;Dawn&quot; mission (originally planned for July 7) had to be launched after &quot;Phoenix&quot; in September. The Delta II rocket was chosen due to its successful launch history, which includes launches of the &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; Mars Exploration Rovers in 2003 and Mars Pathfinder in 1996.

A noctilucent cloud was created by the exhaust gas from the Delta II 7925 rocket used to launch &quot;Phoenix&quot;. The colors in the cloud formed from the prism-like effect of the ice particles present in the exhaust trail.
=== Cruise ===
=== Entry, descent, and landing ===

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory made adjustments to the orbits of its two active satellites around Mars, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey, and the European Space Agency similarly adjusted the orbit of its Mars Express spacecraft to be in the right place on May 25, 2008, to observe &quot;Phoenix&quot; as it entered the atmosphere and then landed on the surface. This information helps designers to improve future landers. The projected landing area was an ellipse covering terrain which has been informally named &quot;Green Valley&quot; and contains the largest concentration of water ice outside the poles.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; entered the Martian atmosphere at nearly , and within 7 minutes had decreased its speed to before touching down on the surface. Confirmation of atmospheric entry was received at 4:46 p.m. PDT (23:46 UTC). Radio signals received at 4:53:44 p.m. PDT confirmed that &quot;Phoenix&quot; had survived its difficult descent and landed 15 minutes earlier, thus completing a 680 million km (422 million miles) flight from Earth.

For unknown reasons, the parachute was deployed about 7 seconds later than expected, leading to a landing position some east, near the edge of the predicted 99% landing ellipse.
&quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&#x27;s&quot; High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera photographed &quot;Phoenix&quot; suspended from its parachute during its descent through the Martian atmosphere. This marked the first time ever one spacecraft photographed another in the act of landing on a planet (the Moon not being a planet, but a satellite). The same camera also imaged &quot;Phoenix&quot; on the surface with enough resolution to distinguish the lander and its two solar cell arrays. Ground controllers used Doppler tracking data from &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; to determine the lander&#x27;s precise location as .

&quot;Phoenix&quot; landed in the Green Valley of Vastitas Borealis on May 25, 2008, in the late Martian northern hemisphere spring (Ls=76.73), where the Sun shone on its solar panels the whole Martian day. By the Martian northern Summer solstice (June 25, 2008), the Sun appeared at its maximum elevation of 47.0 degrees. &quot;Phoenix&quot; experienced its first sunset at the start of September 2008.

The landing was made on a flat surface, with the lander reporting only 0.3 degrees of tilt. Just before landing, the craft used its thrusters to orient its solar panels along an east–west axis to maximize power generation. The lander waited 15 minutes before opening its solar panels, to allow dust to settle. The first images from the lander became available around 7:00 p.m. PDT (2008-05-26 02:00 UTC). The images show a surface strewn with pebbles and incised with small troughs into polygons about across and high, with the expected absence of large rocks and hills.

Like the 1970s era &quot;Viking&quot; spacecraft, &quot;Phoenix&quot; used retrorockets for its final descent. Experiments conducted by Nilton Renno, mission co-investigator from the University of Michigan, and his students have investigated how much surface dust would be kicked up on landing. Researchers at Tufts University, led by co-investigator Sam Kounaves, conducted additional in-depth experiments to identify the extent of the ammonia contamination from the hydrazine propellant and its possible effects on the chemistry experiments. In 2007, a report to the American Astronomical Society by Washington State University professor Dirk Schulze-Makuch, suggested that Mars might harbor peroxide-based life forms which the &quot;Viking&quot; landers failed to detect because of the unexpected chemistry. The hypothesis was proposed long after any modifications to &quot;Phoenix&quot; could be made. One of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission investigators, NASA astrobiologist Chris McKay, stated that the report &quot;piqued his interest&quot; and that ways to test the hypothesis with &quot;Phoenix&quot;&#x27;s instruments would be sought.

===Surface mission===

====Communications from the surface====
The robotic arm&#x27;s first movement was delayed by one day when, on May 27, 2008, commands from Earth were not relayed to the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander on Mars. The commands went to NASA&#x27;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as planned, but the orbiter&#x27;s Electra UHF radio system for relaying commands to &quot;Phoenix&quot; temporarily shut off. Without new commands, the lander instead carried out a set of backup activities. On May 27 the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed images and other information from those activities back to Earth.

The robotic arm was a critical part of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; Mars mission. On May 28, scientists leading the mission sent commands to unstow its robotic arm and take more images of its landing site. The images revealed that the spacecraft landed where it had access to digging down a polygon across the trough and digging into its center.

The lander&#x27;s robotic arm touched soil on Mars for the first time on May 31, 2008 (sol ). It scooped dirt and started sampling the Martian soil for ice after days of testing its systems.

====Presence of shallow subsurface water ice====
The polygonal cracking at the landing zone had previously been observed from orbit, and is similar to patterns seen in permafrost areas in polar and high altitude regions of Earth. &quot;Phoenix&quot;″s robotic arm camera took an image underneath the lander on sol 5 that shows patches of a smooth bright surface uncovered when thruster exhaust blew off overlying loose soil. It was later shown to be water ice.

On June 19, 2008 (sol ), NASA announced that dice-sized clumps of bright material in the &quot;Dodo-Goldilocks&quot; trench dug by the robotic arm had vaporized over the course of four days, strongly implying that they were composed of water ice which sublimed following exposure. While dry ice also sublimes, under the conditions present it would do so at a rate much faster than observed.

On July 31, 2008 (sol ), NASA announced that &quot;Phoenix&quot; confirmed the presence of water ice on Mars, as predicted in 2002 by the Mars Odyssey orbiter. During the initial heating cycle of a new sample, TEGA&#x27;s mass spectrometer detected water vapor when the sample temperature reached 0 °C.
Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars with its present low atmospheric pressure, except at the lowest elevations for short periods.

With &quot;Phoenix&quot; in good working order, NASA announced operational funding through September 30, 2008 (sol ). The science team worked to determine whether the water ice ever thaws enough to be available for life processes and if carbon-containing chemicals and other raw materials for life are present.

Additionally during 2008 and early 2009 a debate emerged within NASA over the presence of &#x27;blobs&#x27; which appeared on photos of the vehicle&#x27;s landing struts, which have been variously described as being either water droplets or &#x27;clumps of frost&#x27;. Due to the lack of consensus within the &quot;Phoenix&quot; science project, the issue had not been raised in any NASA news conferences.

One scientist thought that the lander&#x27;s thrusters splashed a pocket of brine from just below the Martian surface onto the landing strut during the vehicle&#x27;s landing. The salts would then have absorbed water vapor from the air, which would have explained how they appeared to grow in size during the first 44 sols (Martian days) before slowly evaporating as Mars temperature dropped.

====Wet chemistry====
On June 24, 2008 (sol ), NASA&#x27;s scientists launched a series of scientific tests. The robotic arm scooped up more soil and delivered it to 3 different on-board analyzers: an oven that baked it and tested the emitted gases, a microscopic imager, and a wet chemistry laboratory (WCL). The lander&#x27;s robotic arm scoop was positioned over the Wet Chemistry Lab delivery funnel on Sol 29 (the 29th Martian day after landing, i.e. June 24, 2008). The soil was transferred to the instrument on sol (June 25, 2008), and &quot;Phoenix&quot; performed the first wet chemistry tests. On Sol 31 (June 26, 2008) &quot;Phoenix&quot; returned the wet chemistry test results with information on the salts in the soil, and its acidity. The wet chemistry lab (WCL) was part of the suite of tools called the Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA).

A 360-degree panorama assembled from images taken on sols 1 and 3 after landing. The upper portion has been vertically stretched by a factor of 8 to bring out details. Visible near the horizon at full resolution are the backshell and parachute (a bright speck above the right edge of the left solar array, about distant) and the heat shield and its bounce mark (two end-to-end dark streaks above the center of the left solar array, about distant); on the horizon, left of the weather mast, is a crater.

===End of the mission===

The solar-powered lander operated two months longer than its three-month prime mission. The lander was designed to last 90 days, and had been running on bonus time since the successful end of its primary mission in August 2008. On October 28, 2008 (sol ), the lander went into safe mode due to power constraints based on the insufficient amount of sunlight reaching the lander, as expected at this time of year. It was decided then to shut down the four heaters that keep the equipment warm, and upon bringing the lander back from safe mode, commands were sent to turn off two of the heaters rather than only one as was originally planned for the first step. The heaters involved provide heat to the robotic arm, TEGA instrument and a pyrotechnic unit on the lander that were unused since landing, so these three instruments were also shut down.

On November 10, Phoenix Mission Control reported the loss of contact with the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander; the last signal was received on November 2. The demise of the craft occurred as a result of a dust storm that reduced power generation even further. While the spacecraft&#x27;s work ended, the analysis of data from the instruments was in its earliest stages.

==== Communication attempts 2010 ====
Though it was not designed to survive the frigid Martian winter, the spacecraft&#x27;s safe mode kept the option open to reestablish communications if the lander could recharge its batteries during the next Martian spring. However, its landing location is in an area that is usually part of the north polar ice cap during the Martian winter, and the lander was seen from orbit to be encased in dry ice. It is estimated that, at its peak, the layer of CO2 ice in the lander&#x27;s vicinity would total about 30 grams/cm2, which is enough to make a dense slab of dry ice at least thick. It was considered unlikely that the spacecraft could endure these conditions, as its fragile solar panels would likely break off under so much weight.

Scientists attempted to make contact with &quot;Phoenix&quot; starting January 18, 2010 (sol ), but were unsuccessful. Further attempts in February and April also failed to pick up any signal from the lander. Project manager Barry Goldstein announced on May 24, 2010, that the project was being formally ended. Images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that its solar panels were apparently irretrievably damaged by freezing during the Martian winter.

===Results of the mission===

====Landscape====
Unlike some other places visited on Mars with landers (&quot;Viking&quot; and &quot;Pathfinder&quot;), nearly all the rocks near &quot;Phoenix&quot; are small. For about as far as the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons between in diameter and are bounded by troughs that are deep. These shapes are due to ice in the soil expanding and contracting due to major temperature changes. The microscope showed that the soil on top of the polygons is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. Also, unlike other places visited on Mars, the site has no ripples or dunes. Ice is present a few inches below the surface in the middle of the polygons, and along its edges, the ice is at least deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly sublimates. Some dust devils were observed.

====Weather====
Snow was observed to fall from cirrus clouds. The clouds formed at a level in the atmosphere that was around , so the clouds would have to be composed of water-ice, rather than carbon dioxide-ice (dry ice) because, at the low pressure of the Martian atmosphere, the temperature for forming carbon dioxide ice is much lower—less than . It is now thought that water ice (snow) would have accumulated later in the year at this location. This represents a milestone in understanding Martian weather. Wind speeds ranged from . The usual average speed was . These speeds seem high, but the atmosphere of Mars is very thin—less than 1% of the Earth&#x27;s—and so did not exert much force on the spacecraft. The highest temperature measured during the mission was , while the coldest was .

====Climate cycles====
Interpretation of the data transmitted from the craft was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. As per the peer-reviewed data the presence of water ice has been confirmed and that the site had a wetter and warmer climate in the recent past. Finding calcium carbonate in the Martian soil leads scientists to think that the site had been wet or damp in the geological past. During seasonal or longer period diurnal cycles water may have been present as thin films. The tilt or obliquity of Mars changes far more than the Earth; hence times of higher humidity are probable.

====Surface chemistry====

Chemistry results showed the surface soil to be moderately alkaline, with a pH of 7.7 ±0.5. The overall level of salinity is modest. TEGA analysis of its first soil sample indicated the presence of bound water and CO2 that were released during the final (highest-temperature, 1,000 °C) heating cycle.

The elements detected and measured in the samples are chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and sulfate. Further data analysis indicated that the soil contains soluble sulfate (SO42-) at a minimum of 1.1% and provided a refined formulation of the soil.

Analysis of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; WCL also showed that the Ca(ClO4)2 in the soil has not interacted with liquid water of any form, perhaps for as long as 600 million years. If it had, the highly soluble Ca(ClO4)2 in contact with liquid water would have formed only CaSO4. This suggests a severely arid environment, with minimal or no liquid water interaction. The pH and salinity level were viewed as benign from the standpoint of biology.

;Perchlorate
On August 1, 2008, &quot;Aviation Week&quot; reported that &quot;&quot;The White House has been alerted by NASA about plans to make an announcement soon on major new &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander discoveries concerning the &quot;potential for life&quot; on Mars, scientists tell Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology.&quot;&quot; This led to a subdued media speculation on whether some evidence of past or present life had been discovered. To quell the speculation, NASA released the preliminary findings stating that Mars soil contains perchlorate () and thus may not be as life-friendly as thought earlier. The presence of almost 0.5% perchlorates in the soil was an unexpected finding with broad implications.

Laboratory research published in July 2017 demonstrated that when irradiated with a simulated Martian UV flux, perchlorates become bacteriocidal. Two other compounds of the Martian surface, iron oxides and hydrogen peroxide, act in synergy with irradiated perchlorates to cause a 10.8-fold increase in cell death when compared to cells exposed to UV radiation after 60 seconds of exposure. It was also found that abraded silicates (quartz and basalt) lead to the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species. The results leaves the question of the presence of organic compounds open-ended since heating the samples containing perchlorate would have broken down any organics present. However, in the cold subsurface of Mars, which provides substantial protection against UV radiation, halotolerant organisms might survive enhanced perchlorate concentrations by physiological adaptations similar to those observed in the yeast &quot;Debaryomyces hansenii&quot; exposed in lab experiments to increasing NaClO4 concentrations.

Perchlorate (ClO4) is a strong oxidizer, so it has the potential of being used for rocket fuel and as a source of oxygen for future missions. Also, when mixed with water, perchlorate can greatly lower freezing point of water, in a manner similar to how salt is applied to roads to melt ice. So, perchlorate may be allowing small amounts of liquid water to form on the surface of Mars today. Gullies, which are common in certain areas of Mars, may have formed from perchlorate melting ice and causing water to erode soil on steep slopes. Perchlorates have also been detected at the landing site of the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover, nearer equatorial Mars, and in the martian meteorite EETA79001, suggesting a &quot;global distribution of these salts&quot;. Only highly refractory and/or well-protected organic compounds are likely to be preserved in the frozen subsurface. Therefore, the MOMA instrument planned to fly on the 2022 ExoMars rover will employ a method that is unaffected by the presence of perchlorates to detect and measure sub-surface organics.

==&quot;Phoenix&quot; DVD==

Attached to the deck of the lander (next to the US flag) is a special DVD compiled by The Planetary Society. The disc contains Visions of Mars, a multimedia collection of literature and art about the Red Planet. Works include the text of H.G. Wells&#x27; 1897 novel &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (and the 1938 radio broadcast by Orson Welles), Percival Lowell&#x27;s 1908 book &quot;Mars as the Abode of Life&quot; with a map of his proposed canals, Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, and Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Green Mars&quot;. There are also messages directly addressed to future Martian visitors or settlers from, among others, Carl Sagan and Arthur C. Clarke. In 2006, The Planetary Society collected a quarter of a million names submitted through the Internet and placed them on the disc, which claims, on the front, to be &quot;the first library on Mars.&quot; This DVD is made of a special silica glass designed to withstand the Martian environment, lasting for hundreds (if not thousands) of years on the surface while it awaits retrieval by future explorers. This is similar in concept to the Voyager Golden Record that was sent on the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; missions.

The text just below the center of the disk reads:

A previous CD version was supposed to have been sent with the Russian spacecraft &quot;Mars 94&quot;, intended to land on Mars in Fall 1995.

<text>Heterobasidiomycetes, including jelly fungi, smuts and rusts, are basidiomycetes with septate basidia. This contrasts them to [[homobasidiomycetes]] (alternatively called holobasidiomycetes), including most mushrooms and other Agaricomycetes, which have aseptate basidia. The division of all basidiomycetes between these two groups has been influential in fungal taxonomy, and is still used informally, but it is no longer the basis of formal classification. In modern taxonomy homobasidiomycetes roughly correspond to the monophyletic class Agaricomycetes, whereas heterobasidiomycetes are paraphyletic and as such correspond to various taxa from different taxonomic ranks, including the Basidiomycota other than Agaricomycetes and a few basal groups within Agaricomycetes.

==Distinction between homo- and heterobasidiomycetes==
In addition to having septate basidia, heterobasidiomycetes also frequently possess large irregularly shaped sterigmata and spores that are capable of self-replication – a process where a spore, instead of germinating into a vegetative hypha, gives rise to a sterigma and a new spore, which is then discharged as if from a normal basidium. In contrast, homobasidiomycetes, in addition to having aseptate basidia, generally have small regularly shaped sterigmata and spores that do not self-replicate. In different classifications, different features have been stressed.

==Intermediate forms==
Certain taxa, such as Dacrymycetaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae or Tulasnellaceae, due to possessing a combination of hetero- as well as homobasidiomycetous features, have been difficult to definitively assign to either group, resulting in dissenting opinions among taxonomists. For example, Dacrymycetaceae possess very large and irregularly shaped sterigmata as well as self-replicating spores, but have aseptate basidia. Tulasnellaceae have self-replicating spores and grossly swollen sterigmata that are separated from the basidium with a septum at the base, however the basidial body itself is not septate and the sterigmata and the basidium are quite regularly shaped. Ceratobasidiaceae have aseptate basidia, but the sterigmata are quite large and irregular and the spores are self-replicating.

==History==
The terms homo- and heterobasidiomycetes were coined by Patouillard in 1900 (&quot;&quot;Hétérobasidiés&quot; and &quot;Homobasidiés&quot;&quot;). He divided all basidiomycetes between these two groups. This distinction formed the basis of various classifications up to the end of the 20th century. The terms have been used for taxa at the subclass but later at the class level, as fungi were elevated from a phylum of plants to an independent kingdom (consequently shifting the class Basidiomycetes to the phylum Basidiomycota).

Homobasidiomycetes have been present in most if not all major classifications throughout the 20th century (called holobasidiomycetes in some), and only vary with regard to which of the groups combining both hetero- and homobasidiomycetous features are included. The composition of Heterobasidiomycetes has been more variable. In addition to the variable inclusion or exclusion of groups with intermediate features, they have frequently been split into two different groups alongside homobasidiomycetes (one including either only smuts or both smuts and rusts, and the other including the remaining heterobasidiomycetes, mainly jelly fungi). Toward the end of the 20th century, the term &quot;heterobasidiomycetes&quot; has sometimes been reserved to jelly fung only, excluding smuts and rusts.

Throughout most of the 20th century, no single one of these systems gained dominance over the others. In the last quarter of the 20th century, micrography of the septal pore apparatus began to clarify the true phylogenetic relationships in Basidiomycota. However, it was not until the use of molecular systematics in the 90s and early 2000s that fungal taxonomy arrived at a consensus.

==Modern view==
A phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal genes in 1993 showed that heterobasidiomycetes as originally circumscribed by Patouillard in 1900 in fact correspond quite well to a grade of fungi that is paraphyletic in relation to the homobasidiomycetes, the bulk of the latter forming a monophyletic clade. Remarkably, despite a century long effort, classifications after Patouillard had only increased the distance from the true phylogeny. The subsequent rapid accumulation of molecular data in the past two decades has allowed mycologists to abandon the use of paraphyletic taxa and arrive at a consensus classification based on monophyletic clades that was finalized in 2007.

The bulk of homobasidiomycetes forms a monophyletic clade, constituting majority of the modern Agaricomycetes. Heterobasidiomycetes correspond to most Basidiomycota other than the homobasidiomycetes: the subphyla Ustilaginomycotina (smuts), Pucciniomycotina (rusts and a variety of other forms), and from the subphylum Agaricomycotina the classes Tremellomycetes and Dacrymycetes, the orders Auriculariales and Sebacinales within the class Agaricomycetes, and the families Ceratobasidiaceae and Tulasnellaceae from the agaricomycete order Cantharellales (these members of the Agaricomycotina, save for the web-like Ceratobasidiaceae, are collectively known as the jelly fungi).

<text>Soldier Blue is a 1970 American revisionist Western film directed by Ralph Nelson and starring Candice Bergen, Peter Strauss, and Donald Pleasence. Adapted by John Gay from the novel &quot;Arrow in the Sun&quot; by T.V. Olsen, it is inspired by events of the 1864 Sand Creek massacre in the Colorado Territory. Nelson and Gay intended to utilize the narrative surrounding the Sand Creek massacre as an allegory for the contemporary Vietnam War.

Released in August 1970, the film drew attention for its frank depictions of violence, specifically its graphic final sequence. Some film scholars have cited &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; as a critique of America&#x27;s &quot;archetypal art form [the Western],&quot; with other interpretations ranging from it being an anti-war picture to an exploitation film.

==Plot==
In 1877 Colorado Territory, a young woman, Cresta Lee, and young Colorado Private Honus Gant are joined together by fate when they are the only two survivors after their group is massacred by the Cheyenne. Gant is devoted to his country and duty; Lee, who has lived with the Cheyenne for two years, is scornful of Gant (she refers to him as &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; derisively) and declares that in this conflict she sympathizes with them. The two must now try to make it to Fort Reunion, the army camp, where Cresta&#x27;s fiancé, an army officer, waits for her. As they travel through the desert with very low supplies, hiding from the Native Americans, they are spotted by a group of Kiowa horsemen. Under pressure from Cresta, Honus fights and seriously wounds the group&#x27;s chief when the chief challenges him. Honus finds himself unable to kill the disgraced Kiowa leader, whose own men stab him leaving Honus and Cresta alone. The ideological gulf between them is also revealed in their attitudes towards societal mores, with the almost-puritanical Honus disturbed by things Cresta barely notices.

The duo are pursued by a corrupt trader who sells guns to the Cheyenne, but whose latest shipment of weapons Honus has managed to destroy. An injured Honus finds himself in a cave where Cresta has left him to get help. She arrives at Fort Reunion, only to discover that her fiancé&#x27;s cavalry unit plans to attack the peaceful Native American village of the Cheyenne the following day. She rides to the village in time to warn Spotted Wolf, the Cheyenne chief. The chief does not recognize the danger and, under a U.S. flag, rides out to extend a hand of friendship to the European American soldiers. The soldiers, however, obey the orders of their psychopathic commanding officer and open artillery fire on the village.

After a cavalry charge decimates the Native American men, the soldiers enter the village and begin to rape and kill the Cheyenne women. Honus attempts to halt the atrocities, to no avail, and he is later arrested for treason by his own comrades. Cresta attempts to lead the remaining women and children to safety, but her group is discovered and massacred, though Cresta herself survives and is arrested for treason by the soldiers. Honus is dragged away chained behind an army wagon while a despairing Cresta is left with the few Cheyenne survivors.

==Production==
The film provided the first motion picture account of the Sand Creek massacre, one of the most infamous incidents in the history of the American frontier, in which Colorado Territory militia under Colonel John M. Chivington massacred a defenseless village of Cheyenne and Arapaho on the Colorado Eastern Plains.

The account of the massacre is included as part of a longer fictionalized story about the escape of two white survivors from an earlier massacre of U.S. Cavalry troops by Cheyenne, and names of the actual historical characters were changed. Director Nelson stated that he was inspired to make the film based on the wars in Vietnam and Sơn Mỹ.

Principal photography began on October 28, 1969, with exterior photography taking place in Mexico. Arthur J. Ornitz was originally hired as the film&#x27;s cinematographer, but was replaced by Robert B. Hauser several weeks into production. According to Bergen, a large van full of prosthetics was brought in during the filming of the violent battle sequences, full of dummy body parts and animatronics. Additionally, amputees from Mexico City were hired to serve as extras during the final massacre sequence.

==Release==
&quot;Soldier Blue&quot; premiered in New York City on August 12, 1970, and opened in Los Angeles two days later on August 14, 1970.

===Box office===
The film was the third-most popular film at the British box office in 1971. It brought $1.2 million from the U.S./ Canada rentals. The title song, written and performed by Buffy Sainte-Marie, was released as a single and became a top ten hit in the UK as well as other countries in Europe and Japan during the summer of 1971.

==Reception==
===Contemporaneous===
Multiple film critics said &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; evoked the My Lai massacre, which had been disclosed to the American public the previous year. In September 1970, Dotson Rader writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, remarked that &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; &quot;must be numbered among the most significant, the most brutal and liberating, the most honest American films ever made.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote of the film: &quot;&quot;Soldier Blue&quot; is indeed savage, but it wears its cloak of &quot;truth&quot; self-consciously. It is supposed to be a pro-Indian movie, and at the end the camera tells us the story was true, more or less, and that the Army chief of staff himself called the massacre shown in the film one of the most shameful moments in American history.&quot; He added: &quot;So it was, and of course we&#x27;re supposed to make the connection with My Lai and take &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; as an allegory for Vietnam. But that just won&#x27;t do. The film is too mixed up to qualify as a serious allegory about anything.&quot; The &quot;Time Out&quot; film guide called the film &quot;a grimly embarrassing anti-racist Western about the U.S. Cavalry&#x27;s notorious Sand Creek Indian massacre in 1864. In the interests of propaganda, one might just about stomach the way the massacre itself is turned into a gleefully exploitative gore-fest of blood and amputated limbs; but not when it&#x27;s associated with a desert romance that&#x27;s shot like an ad-man&#x27;s wet dream, all soft focus and sweet nothings.&quot;

===Contemporary===
Modern critics and scholars have alternately described &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; as a revisionist western anti-American, and as an exploitation film. In 2004, the BBC named it &quot;one of the most significant American films ever made.&quot; British author and critic P.B. Hurst, who wrote the 2008 book &quot;The Most Savage Film: Soldier Blue, Cinematic Violence and the Horrors of War&quot;, said of the film:

Retrospective analysis has placed the film in a tradition of motion pictures of the early 1970s – such as &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; (1972) – which were used as &quot;natural venues for remarking on the killing of women and children by American soldiers&quot; in light of the political conflicts of the era. However, the &quot;visual excesses&quot; of the film&#x27;s most violent sequences have been similarly criticized as exploitative by modern critics as well.

In a 2005 article on the film in &quot;Uncut&quot;, Kevin Maher deemed it &quot;a bloody 1970 exploitation western ... [which] has a gore-count worthy of &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; awarded the film one out of five stars, writing: &quot;&quot;Soldier Blue&quot; suffers from Bergen&#x27;s weak performance and Strauss is bland, but the parallel between the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre and Vietnam&#x27;s My Lai incident is disturbing and the film&#x27;s depiction of Native American life is an explicit attempt to move past Hollywood stereotypes.&quot;

Film scholar Christopher Frayling described &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; as a &quot;much more angry film&quot; than its contemporary Westerns, which &quot;challenges the language of the traditional Western at the same time as its ideological bases.&quot; Frayling also praised its cinematography and visual elements in his 2006 book &quot;Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone&quot;: &quot;most critics succeeded in missing the really inventive sections of &quot;Soldier Blue&quot;, which involve Nelson&#x27;s use of elaborate zooms, and of untraditional compositions, both of which subtly explore the relationship between the &#x27;initiates&#x27; and the virgin land which surrounds them.&quot;

Recalling the film, star Candice Bergen commented that it was &quot;a movie whose heart, if nothing else, was in the right place.&quot;

===In culture===
Artist Andrea Carlson&#x27;s 2010 work &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; incorporates text and images from several cannibal films popular in the 1970s and 1980s.

==History==
===Early years===
The University of Milan was founded in 1924 from the merger of two institutions that boasted a great tradition of medical, scientific and humanistic studies: the &quot;Accademia Scientifico-Letteraria&quot; (Scientific-Literary Academy), active since 1861, and the &quot;Istituti Clinici di Perfezionamento&quot; (Clinical Specialisation Institutes), established in 1906. By 1928, the University already had the fourth-highest number of enrolled students in Italy, after the University of Naples, Sapienza University of Rome and the University of Padua. Many of its premises are located in Città Studi (City of Studies), the university district of Milan (where the Polytechnic University of Milan is also located) which was built from 1915 onwards. The scientific Schools and Departments of the University of Milan are mostly located in the Città Studi district, while the School of Humanities, School of Law, School of Political, Economic and Social Sciences, among others, are mostly located within the historic city centre.

At the time of its foundation, there were four &quot;traditional&quot; Schools – Law, Humanities, Medicine, and Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences. Later, in the 1930s, the Schools of Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture were introduced, after the aggregation of the old Schools of Veterinary Medicine (1792) and Agriculture (1871).

At the end of the Second World War, the old &quot;Ospedale Maggiore di Milano&quot; (Major Hospital of Milan) building, originally named the &quot;Magna Domus Hospitalis&quot; (The Great House of the Hospital) and colloquially known as the &quot;Ca&#x27; Granda&quot; (The Great House), was assigned to the University of Milan. One of the first Italian examples of civil architecture and the main building of the Policlinico of Milan hospital complex established during the Renaissance period, it was designed by Filarete and commissioned in 1456 by Francesco I Sforza, the fourth Duke of Milan (the first Duke from the House of Sforza, which had succeeded the House of Visconti in 1450). The building had been seriously damaged by the bombings of 1943. In 1958, after a complex series of reconstruction and renovation works, it became home to the University Rector&#x27;s Office, the administrative offices, and the Schools of Law and Humanities.

===1960s reformation===
In the 1960s, due to the extension of compulsory school attendance and the subsequent liberalisation of access to higher education, the number of people entering Italian universities progressively increased and the University of Milan enrolled more than 60,000 students. The University broadened the range of its courses and at the same time increased its number of centres. Two new schools (the School of Pharmacy and the School of Social and Political Sciences) were established, and were based, respectively, in Città Studi and in Via Conservatorio, in the city centre of Milan. Città Studi was also the site of a new complex, intended entirely for the Biology departments, which was the work of architect Vico Magistretti.

There was also an increase in the number of agreements with the city&#x27;s hospital facilities, where students from the School of Medicine receive their clinical training.
In 1968, the University was occupying approximately ; by the beginning of the 1980s this had increased to . In 1989 there were 22 degree-awarding schools and 75,000 enrolled students, which increased to 90,000 by 1993.

===1980s streamline process===
In view of this increase, the University began a process of streamlining and delocalising its facilities: from 1986 onwards, new centres began to appear in other areas of Milan, particularly in the Bicocca district, as well as in other parts of the region: in Como, Varese, Crema and Lodi.

In 1998, the University split in two and the city&#x27;s second public institution was founded: The University of Milan-Bicocca. The University of Insubria was also established in Varese, bringing together courses that were already offered at Varese and Como by the Universities of Milan and Pavia.
At the conclusion of this process, notwithstanding the reduction in the number of students, the University of Milan was still the largest institution in Lombardy and still one of the largest in the country.

The 2001 law that transformed the education system opened a new phase of change. 
The University updated its range of courses, trying to adapt them to better suit the evolution of the social demand for education and the innovation of the production system: thus, the number of degree-awarding programmes rose to 74 and there was a new increase in enrolments.
There was also an increase in the University&#x27;s commitment to providing student services (orientation, internships and training, online education) and in investments for new education and research facilities, covering approximately .

The most recent phase of expansion concerned the fields of communication science, intercultural mediation and art, but there are also ongoing projects relating to the sectors of information technology, veterinary medicine and biomedicine. Furthermore, there was also a strengthening of commitment to technology transfer and the practical application of scientific research results in the economic-production context.

===Present===
At present, the University comprises 9 schools, 134 degree-awarding programmes (both undergraduate and graduate), 19 doctoral schools (&quot;scuole di dottorato&quot;) and 92 specialisation schools (&quot;scuole di specializzazione&quot;). Approximately 65,000 students are enrolled at the University. The teaching staff is composed of 2,500 tenured professors and researchers and approximately 500 adjunct professors. More than 2,300 people work in the technical and administrative sector. The University of Milan was one of the institutions that helped to establish the League of European Research Universities (LERU) and is the only Italian member of the organisation. Thanks to its commitment to basic and applied research, the University of Milan is among Italy&#x27;s top institutions in the main national and international rankings.

==Academics==
The University of Milan is a public teaching and research university, the second largest university in Italy, which – with 10 schools and a teaching staff of about 2,200 – comprises a wide variety of disciplinary fields.

==Campuses==
The University of Milan possesses a substantial artistic and cultural heritage that includes renowned historic buildings, inherited and acquired collections, archives, botanical gardens and the old Brera Astronomical Observatory commissioned by Maria Theresa of Austria. The University&#x27;s departments are housed in important historic buildings in the centre of Milan and in modern buildings in the area known as &quot;Città Studi&quot; (City of Studies). Among the palazzos that house the University&#x27;s facilities are the old &quot;Ca’ Granda&quot; (The Great House) designed by Filarete, a monumental complex from the 15th century in the heart of the historical city centre; the 18th-century &quot;Palazzo Greppi&quot; designed by Giuseppe Piermarini (architect of La Scala in Milan), and the 17th-century Sant’Alessandro College commissioned by the Arcimboldi family. The book collection, which is one of the richest in the region, is preserved in 47 libraries, while the APICE Centre collects rare and valuable book stocks and archives.

The total university surface area is about , comprising 356 classrooms with approximately 27,382 seats, 203 teaching and computer laboratories with approximately 1,831 seats and 171 libraries and study rooms with approximately 4,417 seats.

=== Headquarters – City Centre Campus ===
Built in 1456 by Francesco I Sforza, Duke of Milan, the &quot;Ca’ Granda&quot; (The Great House) designed by Filarete is the headquarters of the University of Milan. It was originally named the &quot;Magna Domus Hospitalis&quot; (The Great House of the Hospital) and was the main building of the Policlinico of Milan, a large hospital complex established during the Renaissance period, which was later expanded with the addition of adjacent structures or nearby buildings in the city centre, close to the Milan Cathedral (&quot;Duomo di Milano&quot;). The historical buildings of the Policlinico of Milan underwent a careful restoration in the 20th and early 21st centuries. The &quot;Ca’ Granda&quot; was one of the first Renaissance buildings in Milan and had a large following throughout northern Italy. 

At present, it is the seat of the Rectorate of the University of Milan and contains some of the main administrative offices; as well as the central library, lecture halls and auditoria of the School of Humanities and the School of Law.

=== Città Studi – Scientific Campus ===
Since the late 1960s, the exponential growth of the number of enrolled students forced the university to build other structures in the Città Studi neighbourhood, where the main buildings of all scientific schools and departments of the University of Milan are located, as well as the majority of the research facilities. The Polytechnic University of Milan is also located in this quarter.

The &quot;Città Studi Campus Sostenibile&quot; (CSCS, &quot;Città Studi Sustainable Campus&quot;) is a joint project launched by the University of Milan and the Polytechnic University of Milan in 2011 to turn the Città Studi (the historic university quarter in the city, home to the main campuses of two of its largest universities) into a forum on issues of sustainable development, thereby creating a model for the city at large to follow.

Devised as six roundtables on areas of intervention – People, Energy, Education, Mobility, City, and Food and Health – the project aims to implement a series of best practices with the goal of improving the quality of life for those living in the university quarter, through projects, events and programmes.

=== Milan Innovation District – MIND ===
Australia-based Lendlease has been contracted to design, build and manage the MIND campus of the University of Milan by a resolution of the board of directors. The project for the new campus of the science schools and departments of the University of Milan, located in the Milan Innovation District (MIND) within the former Expo 2015 area, covers a total area of over 190,000 square meters. The new area will be shared with Human Technopole, Italy&#x27;s new research institute for life sciences, and the new IRCSS Galeazzi Orthopedic Institute for Medicine. The project has a total value of approximately €338 million.

<text>Harold Clayton Urey ( ; April 29, 1893 – January 5, 1981) was an American physical chemist whose pioneering work on isotopes earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for the discovery of deuterium. He played a significant role in the development of the atom bomb, as well as contributing to theories on the development of organic life from non-living matter.

Born in Walkerton, Indiana, Urey studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis at the University of California, Berkeley. After he received his PhD in 1923, he was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. He was a research associate at Johns Hopkins University before becoming an associate professor of chemistry at Columbia University. In 1931, he began work with the separation of isotopes that resulted in the discovery of deuterium.

During World War II, Urey turned his knowledge of isotope separation to the problem of uranium enrichment. He headed the group located at Columbia University that developed isotope separation using gaseous diffusion. The method was successfully developed, becoming the sole method used in the early post-war period. After the war, Urey became professor of chemistry at the Institute for Nuclear Studies, and later Ryerson professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago.

Urey speculated that the early terrestrial atmosphere was composed of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. One of his Chicago graduate students was Stanley L. Miller, who showed in the Miller–Urey experiment that, if such a mixture were exposed to electric sparks and water, it can interact to produce amino acids, commonly considered the building blocks of life. Work with isotopes of oxygen led to pioneering the new field of paleoclimatic research. In 1958, he accepted a post as a professor at large at the new University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where he helped create the science faculty. He was one of the founding members of UCSD&#x27;s school of chemistry, which was created in 1960. He became increasingly interested in space science, and when Apollo 11 returned Moon rock samples from the Moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. Lunar astronaut Harrison Schmitt said that Urey approached him as a volunteer for a one-way mission to the Moon, stating &quot;I will go, and I don&#x27;t care if I don&#x27;t come back.&quot;

== Early life ==
Harold Clayton Urey was born on April 29, 1893, in Walkerton, Indiana, the son of Samuel Clayton Urey, a school teacher and a minister in the Church of the Brethren, and his wife, Cora Rebecca née Reinoehl. Of mostly German ancestry, the family name had English origins. He had a younger brother, Clarence, and a younger sister, Martha. The family moved to Glendora, California, after Samuel became seriously ill with tuberculosis, in hopes that the climate would improve his health. When it became clear that he would die, the family moved back to Indiana to live with Cora&#x27;s widowed mother. Samuel died when Harold was six years old.

Urey was educated in an Amish grade school, from which he graduated at the age of 14. He then attended high school in Kendallville, Indiana. After graduating in 1911, he obtained a teacher&#x27;s certificate from Earlham College, and taught in a small school house in Indiana. He later moved to Montana, where his mother was then living, and continued to teach there.

Urey entered the University of Montana in Missoula in the autumn of 1914. Unlike Eastern universities of the time, the University of Montana was co-educational in both students and teachers. Urey earned a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in zoology there in 1917.

As a result of the United States entry into World War I that same year, there was strong pressure to support the war effort. Urey had been raised in a religious sect that opposed war. One of his professors suggested that he support the wartime effort by working as a chemist. Urey took a job with the Barrett Chemical Company in Philadelphia, making TNT, rather than joining the army as a soldier. After the war, he returned to the University of Montana as an instructor in chemistry.

An academic career required a doctorate, so in 1921 Urey enrolled in a PhD program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis. His initial attempt at a thesis was on the ionization of cesium vapor. He ran into difficulties, and Meghnad Saha published a better paper on the same subject. Urey then wrote his thesis on the ionization states of an ideal gas, which was subsequently published in the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;. After he received his PhD in 1923, Urey was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he met Werner Heisenberg, Hans Kramers, Wolfgang Pauli, Georg von Hevesy, and John Slater. At the conclusion of his stay, he traveled to Germany, where he met Albert Einstein and James Franck.

On returning to the United States, Urey received an offer of a National Research Council fellowship to Harvard University, and also received an offer to be a research associate at Johns Hopkins University. He chose the latter. Before taking up the job, he traveled to Seattle, Washington, to visit his mother. On the way, he stopped by Everett, Washington, where he knew Dr. Kate Daum, a colleague from the University of Montana. Dr. Daum introduced Urey to her sister, Frieda. Urey and Frieda soon became engaged. They were married at her father&#x27;s house in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1926. The couple had four children: Gertrude Bessie (Elizabeth), born in 1927; Frieda Rebecca, born in 1929; Mary Alice, born in 1934; and John Clayton Urey, born in 1939.

At Johns Hopkins, Urey and Arthur Ruark wrote &quot;Atoms, Quanta and Molecules&quot; (1930), one of the first English texts on quantum mechanics and its applications to atomic and molecular systems. In 1929, Urey became an associate professor of chemistry at Columbia University, where his colleagues included Rudolph Schoenheimer, David Rittenberg, and T. I. Taylor.

== Deuterium ==
In the 1920s, William Giauque and Herrick L. Johnston discovered the stable isotopes of oxygen. Isotopes were not well understood at the time; James Chadwick would not discover the neutron until 1932. Two systems were in use for classifying them, based on chemical and physical properties. The latter was determined using the mass spectrograph. Since it was known that the atomic weight of oxygen was almost exactly 16 times as heavy as hydrogen, Raymond Birge, and Donald Menzel hypothesized that hydrogen had more than one isotope as well. Based upon the difference between the results of the two methods, they predicted that only one hydrogen atom in 4,500 was of the heavy isotope.

In 1931, Urey set out to find it. Urey and George M. Murphy (1903–1968) calculated from the Balmer series that the heavy isotope should have lines blueshifted (correspondingly the light isotope redshifted) by . Urey had access to a grating spectrograph, a sensitive device that had been recently installed at Columbia and was capable of resolving the Balmer series. With a resolution of 1 Å per millimetre, the machine should have produced a difference of about 1 millimetre. However, since only one atom in 4,500 was heavy, the line on the spectrograph was very faint. Urey therefore decided to delay publishing their results until he had more conclusive evidence that it was heavy hydrogen.

Urey and Murphy calculated from the Debye model that the heavy isotope would have a slightly higher boiling point than the light one. By carefully warming liquid hydrogen, 5 litres of liquid hydrogen could be distilled to 1 millilitre, which would be enriched in the heavy isotope by 100 to 200 times. To obtain five litres of liquid hydrogen, they traveled to the cryogenics laboratory at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., where they obtained the help of Ferdinand Brickwedde, whom Urey had known at Johns Hopkins.

The first sample that Brickwedde sent was evaporated at at a pressure of . To their surprise, this showed no evidence of enrichment. Brickwedde then prepared a second sample evaporated at at a pressure of . On this sample, the Balmer lines for heavy hydrogen were seven times as intense. The paper announcing the discovery of heavy hydrogen, later named deuterium, was jointly published by Urey, Murphy, and Brickwedde in 1932. Urey was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 &quot;for his discovery of heavy hydrogen&quot;. He declined to attend the ceremony in Stockholm, so that he could be present at the birth of his daughter Mary Alice. He was elected to both the American Philosophical Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences the following year.

Working with Edward W. Washburn from the Bureau of Standards, Urey subsequently discovered the cause of the anomalous sample. Brickwedde&#x27;s hydrogen had been separated from water by electrolysis, resulting in a depleted sample. Moreover, Francis William Aston had reported that his calculated value for the atomic weight of hydrogen was wrong, thereby invalidating Birge and Menzel&#x27;s original reasoning. The discovery of deuterium stood, however.

Urey and Washburn attempted to use electrolysis to create pure heavy water. Their technique was sound, but they were beaten to it in 1933 by Lewis, who had the resources of the University of California at his disposal. Using the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, Urey and David Rittenberg calculated the properties of gases containing hydrogen and deuterium. They extended this to enriching compounds of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. These could be used as tracers in biochemistry, resulting in a whole new way of examining chemical reactions. He founded the &quot;Journal of Chemical Physics&quot; in 1932, and was its first editor, serving in that capacity until 1940.

At Columbia, Urey chaired the University Federation for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom. He supported Atlanticist Clarence Streit&#x27;s proposal for a federal union of the world&#x27;s major democracies, and the republican cause during the Spanish Civil War. He was an early opponent of German Nazism and assisted refugee scientists, including Enrico Fermi, by helping them find work in the United States, and to adjust to life in a new country.

== Manhattan Project ==
By the time World War II broke out in Europe in 1939, Urey was recognized as a world expert on isotope separation. Thus far, separation had involved only the light elements. In 1939 and 1940, Urey published two papers on the separation of heavier isotopes in which he proposed centrifugal separation. This assumed great importance due to speculation by Niels Bohr that uranium 235 was fissile. Because it was considered &quot;very doubtful whether a chain reaction can be established without separating 235 from the rest of the uranium,&quot; Urey began intensive studies of how uranium enrichment might be achieved. Apart from centrifugal separation, George Kistiakowsky suggested that gaseous diffusion might be a possible method. A third possibility was thermal diffusion. Urey coordinated all isotope separation research efforts, including the effort to produce heavy water, which could be used as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors.
In May 1941, Urey was appointed to the Committee on Uranium, which oversaw the uranium project as part of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). In 1941, Urey and George B. Pegram led a diplomatic mission to England to establish co-operation on development of the atomic bomb. The British were optimistic about gaseous diffusion, but it was clear that both gaseous and centrifugal methods faced formidable technical obstacles. In May 1943, as the Manhattan Project gained momentum. Urey became head of the wartime Substitute Alloy Materials Laboratories (SAM Laboratories) at Columbia, which was responsible for the heavy water and all the isotope enrichment processes except Ernest Lawrence&#x27;s electromagnetic process.

Early reports on the centrifugal method indicated that it was not as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.

The gaseous diffusion process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on gaseous diffusion. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.

Worn out by the effort, Urey left the project in February 1945, handing over his responsibilities to R. H. Crist. The K-25 plant commenced operation in March 1945, and as the bugs were worked out, the plant operated with remarkable efficiency and economy. For a time, uranium was fed into the S50 liquid thermal diffusion plant, then the K-25 gaseous, and finally the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant; but soon after the war ended the thermal and electromagnetic separation plants were closed down, and separation was performed by K-25 alone. Along with its twin, K-27, constructed in 1946, it became the principal isotope separation plant in the early post-war period. For his work on the Manhattan Project, Urey was awarded the Medal for Merit by the Project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.

== Post-war years ==
After the war, Urey became professor of chemistry at the Institute for Nuclear Studies, and then became Ryerson professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1952. He did not continue his pre-war research with isotopes. However, applying the knowledge gained with hydrogen to oxygen, he realized that the fractionation between carbonate and water for oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 would decrease by a factor of 1.04 between . The ratio of the isotopes could then be used to determine average temperatures, assuming that the measurement equipment was sufficiently sensitive. The team included his colleague Ralph Buchsbaum. Examination of a 100-million-year-old belemnite then indicated the summer and winter temperatures that it had lived through over a period of four years. For this pioneering paleoclimatic research, Urey was awarded the Arthur L. Day Medal by the Geological Society of America, and the Goldschmidt Medal of the Geochemical Society. While at the University of Chicago, Urey contributed to the Urey–Bigeleisen–Mayer equation, a model of stable isotope fractionation.
Urey actively campaigned against the 1946 May-Johnson bill because he feared that it would lead to military control of nuclear energy, but supported and fought for the McMahon bill that replaced it, and ultimately created the Atomic Energy Commission. Urey&#x27;s commitment to the ideal of world government dated from before the war, but the possibility of nuclear war made it only more urgent in his mind. He went on lecture tours against war, and became involved in Congressional debates regarding nuclear issues. He argued publicly on behalf of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee.

==Cosmochemistry and the Miller–Urey experiment==
In later life, Urey helped develop the field of cosmochemistry and is credited with coining the term. His work on oxygen-18 led him to develop theories about the abundance of the chemical elements on Earth, and of their abundance and evolution in the stars. Urey summarized his work in &quot;The Planets: Their Origin and Development&quot; (1952). Urey speculated that the early terrestrial atmosphere was composed of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. One of his Chicago graduate students, Stanley L. Miller, showed in the &quot;Miller–Urey experiment&quot; that, if such a mixture is exposed to electric sparks and to water, it can interact to produce amino acids, commonly considered the building blocks of life.

Urey also researched the isotopic abundance of cosmic bodies, particularly the contribution of radioisotopes to internal heating. In tribute to his contributions, scientists refer to the ratio of a planet&#x27;s internal heat generation to surface heat flux as the &quot;Urey ratio&quot;.

Urey spent a year in the United Kingdom as a visiting professor at Oxford University in 1956 and 1957. In 1958, he reached the University of Chicago&#x27;s retirement age of 65, but he accepted a post as a professor at large at the new University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and moved to La Jolla, California. He was subsequently made a professor emeritus there from 1970 to 1981. Urey helped build up the science faculty there. He was one of the founding members of UCSD&#x27;s school of chemistry, which was created in 1960, along with Stanley Miller, Hans Suess, and Jim Arnold.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, space science became a topic of research in the wake of the launch of Sputnik 1. Urey helped persuade NASA to make uncrewed probes to the Moon a priority. When Apollo 11 returned Moon rock samples from the Moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. The samples supported Urey&#x27;s contention that the Moon and the Earth shared a common origin. While at UCSD, Urey published 105 scientific papers, 47 of them about lunar topics. When asked why he continued to work so hard, he joked, &quot;Well, you know I&#x27;m not on tenure anymore.&quot;

== Death and legacy ==
Urey enjoyed gardening and raising cattleya, cymbidium and other orchids. He died at La Jolla, California, and is buried in the Fairfield Cemetery in DeKalb County, Indiana.

Apart from his Nobel Prize, he also won the Franklin Medal in 1943, the J. Lawrence Smith Medal in 1962, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1966, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1966, and the Priestley Medal of the American Chemical Society in 1973. In 1964 he received the National Medal of Science. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947. Named after him are lunar impact crater Urey, asteroid 4716 Urey, and the H. C. Urey Prize, awarded for achievement in planetary sciences by the American Astronomical Society. The Harold C. Urey Middle School in Walkerton, Indiana, is also named for him, as is Urey Hall, the chemistry building at Revelle College, UCSD, in La Jolla and the Harold C. Urey Lecture Hall at the University of Montana. UCSD has also established a Harold C. Urey chair whose first holder was James Arnold.

Urey&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth Baranger, also became a notable physicist.

<text>The Dallas Morning News is a daily newspaper serving the Dallas–Fort Worth area of Texas, with an average print circulation in 2022 of 65,369. It was founded on October 1, 1885, by Alfred Horatio Belo as a satellite publication of the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot;, of Galveston, Texas. Historically, and to the present day, it is the most prominent newspaper in Dallas.

Throughout the 1990s and as recently as 2010, the paper has won nine Pulitzer Prizes for reporting and photography, George Polk Awards for education reporting and regional reporting, and an Overseas Press Club award for photography. Its headquarters is in downtown Dallas.

==History==

&quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; was founded in 1885 as a spin-off of the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot; by Alfred Horatio Belo. In 1926, the Belo family sold a majority interest in the paper to its longtime publisher, George Dealey. By the 1920s, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; had grown larger than the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot; and had become a progressive force in Dallas and Texas. Adolph Ochs, who saved &quot;The New York Times&quot; from bankruptcy in 1896 and made the newspaper into one of the country&#x27;s most respected, said in 1924 that he had been strongly influenced by &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;.

During the 1920s, when the Ku Klux Klan was a powerful force in Dallas, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; pushed back against the KKK with its news coverage and editorials. In turn, the KKK, which had a membership that included one in three eligible Dallas men, threatened to boycott the newspaper.

In 1904, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; began publishing the &quot;Texas Almanac&quot;, which had previously been published intermittently during the 1800s by the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot;. After over a century of publishing by the &quot;Morning News&quot;, the &quot;Almanac&quot;&#x27;s assets were given to the Texas State Historical Association in May 2008.

By the late 1940s, the &quot;Morning News&quot; had built and opened a new office, newsroom, and printing plant at Houston and Young Streets on the southwest side of downtown Dallas. A notable part of the facade above the front doors includes a quote etched in the stony exterior:
::::::BUILD THE NEWS UPON&lt;br&gt;THE ROCK OF TRUTH&lt;br&gt;AND RIGHTEOUSNESS&lt;br&gt;CONDUCT IT ALWAYS&lt;br&gt;UPON THE LINES OF&lt;br&gt;FAIRNESS AND INTEGRITY&lt;br&gt;ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT&lt;br&gt;OF THE PEOPLE TO GET&lt;br&gt;FROM THE NEWSPAPER&lt;br&gt;BOTH SIDES OF EVERY&lt;br&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTION&lt;br&gt;
The complex at 508 Young Street would house all or part of the &quot;Morning News&quot; operations for the next six decades.

In late 1991, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; became the lone major newspaper in the Dallas market when the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; was closed after several years of circulation wars between the two papers, especially over the then-burgeoning classified advertising market. In July 1986, the &quot;Times Herald&quot; was purchased by William Dean Singleton, owner of MediaNews Group. After 18 months of efforts to turn the paper around, Singleton sold it to an associate. On December 8, 1991, Belo Corporation bought the &quot;Times Herald&quot; for $55 million, closing the paper the next day.

It was not the first time the Belo family had bought and closed a paper named &quot;The Herald&quot; in Dallas.

In 2003, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; launched a Spanish-language newspaper called &quot;Al Día&quot; . Initially &quot;Al Día&quot; came with a purchase price, but it was later made available free. It was published twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday. Publication ceased in June 2023. 

Between 2003 and 2011, a tabloid-sized publication called &quot;Quick&quot; was published by &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, which initially focused on general news in a quick-read, digest form, but in later years covered mostly entertainment and lifestyle stories.

In late 2013, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; ended its longtime news-gathering collaboration with previously co-owned TV station WFAA. The newspaper entered into a new partnership with KXAS at that time.

Historically, the &quot;Morning News&quot;&#x27; opinion section has tilted conservative, mirroring Texas&#x27; drift to the Republican Party since the 1950s. However, on September 7, 2016, it endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the first time it had recommended a Democrat for president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. This came a day after it ran a scathing editorial declaring Republican candidate Donald Trump &quot;not qualified to serve as president.&quot; It was the first time the paper had refused to recommend a Republican since 1964. Then, ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, the &quot;Morning News&quot; once again endorsed a Democratic candidate: Beto O&#x27;Rourke, the challenger to incumbent Senator Ted Cruz. In 2024, the &quot;Morning News&quot; endorsed Colin Allred and referenced Allred&#x27;s bipartisanship and Cruz&#x27;s divisiveness.

In late 2016, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; announced it would move away from its home of 68 years on Young Street to a much-smaller building on Commerce Street previously used as the Dallas Public Library&#x27;s downtown branch. Reasons given for the move included technology innovations and fewer staff, as well as printing presses no longer co-located with the newsroom and main offices. By December 2017, the move was completed. The former property was sold in October 2018 to a business partnership, which was looking into possible redevelopment opportunities for the complex, but in December 2018 the partnership backed out of the deal.

Changes were announced in January 2019, which included layoffs and reducing the paper&#x27;s Business section to one separate section per week, on Sundays; the remainder of the week, Business coverage was placed in the paper&#x27;s Metro section. A total of 43 employees were affected by the move.

In late February 2019, several printing agreements were not renewed at the &quot;Morning News&quot;&#x27; suburban printing plant, and 92 positions were affected by the change there. Publications that had to find a different printing partner included the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; and &quot;Fort Worth Weekly&quot;.

DallasNews Corporation, the paper&#x27;s owner, announced on Sept. 13, 2023, it would offer buyouts eliminating up to 40 jobs, a 6% reduction in staff count. Buyouts would be offered starting Oct. 16. In May 2024, the company announced it would move its Plano printing operation, built in 1980, to a smaller facility in Carrollton. This would result in the elimination of 85 jobs, a 60% staff reduction. The changes were expected to save the company $5 million annually. The News reported in December 2024 it had agreed to sell the Plano location for $43.5 million. A new printing press will be purchased for the new site and should be ready in 2025.

<text>Central Java (, , Pegon: جاوا ماديا) is a province of Indonesia, located in the middle of the island of Java. Its administrative capital is Semarang. It is bordered by West Java in the west, the Indian Ocean and the Special Region of Yogyakarta in the south, East Java in the east, and the Java Sea in the north. It has a total area of 33,750.37 km2, with a population of 36,516,035 at the 2020 Census making it the third-most populous province in both Java and Indonesia after West Java and East Java. The official population estimate in mid-2023 was 37,608,336 The province also includes a number of offshore islands, including the island of Nusakambangan in the south (close to the border of West Java), and the Karimun Jawa Islands in the Java Sea.

Central Java is also a cultural concept that includes the Yogyakarta Special Region, in turn including the city of Yogyakarta; however, administratively that city and its surrounding regencies have formed a separate special region (equivalent to a province) since the country&#x27;s independence, and is administered separately. Although known as the &quot;heart&quot; of Javanese culture, there are several other non-Javanese ethnic groups, such as the Sundanese on the border with West Java. Chinese Indonesians, Arab Indonesians, and Indian Indonesians are also scattered throughout the province.

The province has been inhabited by humans since the prehistoric-era. Remains of a &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, known as &quot;Java Man&quot;, were found along the banks of the Bengawan Solo, and date back to 1.7 million years ago. What is present-day Central Java was once under the control of several Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms, Islamic sultanates, and the Dutch East Indies colonial government. Central Java was also the centre of the Indonesian independence movement. As the majority of modern-day Indonesians are of Javanese descent, both Central Java and East Java have a major impact on Indonesia&#x27;s social, political, and economic life.

The origin of the name &quot;Java&quot; can be traced from the Sanskrit chronicle which mentions the existence of an island called yavadvip(a) (&quot;dvipa&quot; means &quot;island&quot;, and &quot;yava&quot; means &quot;barley&quot; or also &quot;grain&quot;). These grains may be millet (Setaria italica) or rice, both of which have been widely found on this island, before the entry of Indian influence. It is possible that the island had many previous names, including the possibility of it originating from the word &quot;jaú&quot; which means &quot;far away&quot;. Yavadvipa is mentioned in one of the Indian epic, Ramayana. According to the epic, Sugriva, the commander of the wanara (ape man) from Sri Rama&#x27;s army, sent his envoy to Yavadvip (&quot;Java Island&quot;) to look for the Hindu goddess Sita.

Another possibility is that the word &quot;Java&quot; comes from Proto-Austronesian, &quot;Awa&quot; or &quot;Yawa&quot; (Similar to the words &quot;Awa&#x27;i&quot; (Awaiki) or &quot;Hawa&#x27;i&quot; (Hawaiki) used in Polynesia, especially Hawaii) which means &quot;home&quot;.

An island called &quot;Iabadiu&quot; or &quot;Jabadiu&quot; is mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s work called &quot;Geographia&quot; which was made around 150 AD during the era of the Roman Empire. &quot;Iabadiu&quot; is said to mean &quot;island of barley&quot;, also rich in gold, and has a silver city called Argyra at its western end. This name mentioned Java, which most likely origins from the Sanskrit term Java-dvipa (Yawadvipa).

Chinese records from the &quot;Songshu&quot; and the &quot;Liangshu&quot; referred to Java as She-po (5th century AD), He-ling (640–818 AD), then called it She-po again until the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), where they began to call Zhao-Wa. In the book &quot;Yingyai Shenglan&quot;, written by the Chinese Ming explorer Ma Huan, the Chinese call Java as Chao-Wa, and it was once called the She-pó (She-bó). When Giovanni de&#x27; Marignolli returned from China to Avignon, he stopped at the kingdom of Saba, which he said had many elephants and was led by a queen; this name Saba might be his interpretation of She-bó.

=== Prehistoric era ===

Java has been inhabited by humans or their ancestors (hominina) since prehistoric times. In Central Java and the adjacent territories in East Java remains known as &quot;Java Man&quot; were discovered in the 1890s by the Dutch anatomist and geologist Eugène Dubois. It belongs to the species &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, and are believed to be about 1.7 million years old. The Sangiran site is an important prehistoric site on Java.

Around years ago, Australoid peoples related to modern Australian Aboriginals and Melanesians settled in Central Java. They were assimilated or replaced by Mongoloid Austronesians by about 3,000 BC, who brought technologies of pottery, outrigger canoes, the bow and arrow, and introduced domesticated pigs, fowls, and dogs. They also introduced cultivated rice and millet.

=== Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic era ===

Recorded history began in what is now Central Java in the 7th century AD. The writing, as well as Hinduism and Buddhism, were brought by the Indians from South Asia, at the time of Central Java was a centre of power in Java. In 664 AD, the Chinese monk Hui-neng visited the Javanese port city he called &quot;Hēlíng&quot; (訶陵) or &quot;Ho-ling&quot;, where he translated various Buddhist scriptures into Chinese with the assistance of the Javanese Buddhist monk Jñānabhadra. It is not precisely known what is meant by the name &quot;Hēlíng&quot;. It used to be considered the Chinese transcription of &quot;Kalinga&quot; but it is now most commonly thought of as a rendering of the name &quot;Areng&quot;. &quot;Hēlíng&quot; is believed to be located somewhere between Semarang and Jepara.

The first dated inscription in Central Java was the Canggal from 732 AD. This inscription, from Kedu, is written in Sanskrit in Pallava script. It is written that a Shaivite king named Sri Sanjaya established a kingdom called Mataram. Under the reign of Sanjaya&#x27;s dynasty, several monuments such as the Prambanan temple complex were built. At the same time, a competing dynasty Sailendra arose, adhering to Buddhism and built the Borobudur temple. After 820 AD, there was no more mention of the &quot;Hēlíng&quot; in Chinese records. Coinciding with the overthrow of the Sailendras by the Sanjayas who restored Shaivism as the dominant religion. In the middle of the 10th century, however, the centre of power moved to eastern Java. Raden Wijaya founded the Majapahit Empire, and reaching its peak during the reign of Hayam Wuruk. The kingdom claimed sovereignty over the entire Indonesian archipelago, although direct control tended to be limited to Java, Bali and Madura. Gajah Mada was a military leader during this time, who led numerous territorial conquests. The kingdoms in Java had previously based their power on agriculture, but Majapahit had succeeded in seizing ports and shipping lanes, in a bid to become the first commercial empire on Java. The empire suffered a setback after the death of Hayam Wuruk and the entry of Islam into the archipelago.

In the late 16th century, Islam had surpassed Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion in Java. The emergence of Islamic kingdoms in Java is also inseparable from the role of Walisongo. At first, the spread of Islam was quick and was accepted by ordinary people, until the entrance of &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot; and it was carried out by the rulers of the island. The Sultanate of Demak was the first recorded Islamic kingdom in Java, first led by one of the descendants of the Majapahit emperor Raden Patah, who converted to Islam. During this period, Islamic kingdoms began to develop from Pajang, Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Cirebon, and Banten. Another Islamic kingdom, the Sultanate of Mataram, grew into a dominant force in the central and eastern Java. The cities of Surabaya and Cirebon were subdued by Mataram. Only the Mataram and Banten Sultanates remained after the Dutch arrived in the early 17th century. Some Islamic kingdoms in Java can still be found in several regions, such as Surakarta (with two kingdoms of Kasunanan and Mangkunegaran), and Yogyakarta with the Yogyakarta Sultanate and Pakualaman.

=== Dutch colonial rule ===

By the late 16th century, European traders began to frequent central Javanese ports. The Dutch established a presence in the region through the East India Company. Following the fall of Demak to Mataram under the reign of Sultan Agung, Mataram was able to conquer almost all of Java by the 17th century, but internal disputes and Dutch intervention forced it to cede more land to the Dutch. These cessions led to several partitions of Mataram. The first was after the 1755 Treaty of Giyanti, which divided the kingdom in two, the Sultanates of Surakarta and Yogyakarta. Surakarta was divided again with the establishment of the Mangkunegaran following the 1757 Treaty of Salatiga.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Central Java as a Dutch colony was taken over by the British. In 1813, the Sultanate of Yogyakarta was divided with the establishment of the Pakualaman. Following the departure of the British, the Dutch returned as stipulated in the Congress of Vienna. The Java War between 1825 and 1830 ravaged Central Java, which resulted in a consolidation of the Dutch power. The power and the territories of the already divided Mataram were greatly reduced. After the war, the Netherlands enforced the Cultivation System which was linked to famines and epidemics in the 1840s, first in Cirebon and then Central Java, as cash crops such as indigo and sugar had to be grown instead of rice.

In the 1900s, the predecessor of the modern Central Java was created, named &quot;Gouvernement van Midden-Java&quot;. Before 1905, central Java consisted of 5 &quot;gewesten&quot; (regions) namely Semarang, Rembang, Kedu, Banyumas, and Pekalongan. Surakarta was still an independent &quot;vorstenland&quot; (autonomous region) which stood alone and consisted of two regions, Surakarta and Mangkunegaran, as well as Yogyakarta. Each &quot;gewest&quot; consisted of districts. At that time, the &quot;Rembang Gewest&quot; also included &quot;Regentschap Tuban&quot;and &quot;Regentschap Bojonegoro&quot;. After the enactment of the 1905 &quot;Decentralisatie Besluit&quot; (Decentralisation Decision), the governor was given autonomy and a regional Council was formed. In addition, autonomous &quot;gemeente&quot; (municipal) was formed, Pekalongan, Tegal, Semarang, Salatiga, and Magelang. In 1930, the province was designated as an autonomous region with a &quot;provinciale raad&quot; (provincial council). The province consists of several &quot;residenties&quot; (residencies), covering several &quot;regentschap&quot; (districts), divided into several &quot;kawedanan&quot; (districts). Central Java consisted of 5 residences: Pekalongan, Jepara-Rembang, Semarang, Banyumas, and Kedu.

=== Independence and contemporary era ===
On 1 March 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army landed on Java, and the following week, the Dutch East Indies surrendered to Japan. During Japanese rule, Java and Madura were placed under the Japanese 16th Army. Many who lived in areas considered important to the war effort experienced torture, sex slavery, arbitrary arrest and execution, and other war crimes. Thousands of people were taken away as forced labourers (&quot;romusha&quot;) for Japanese military projects, including the Burma-Siam and Saketi-Bayah railways, and suffered or died as a result of ill-treatment and starvation. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of the Japanese occupation. About 2.4 million people died in Java from famine during 1944–45.

Following the surrender of Japan, Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945. The final stages of warfare were initiated in October when, under the terms of their surrender, the Japanese tried to re-establish the authority they relinquished to the Indonesians in towns and cities. The fiercest fighting involving the Indonesian &quot;pemuda&quot; and the Japanese was in Semarang. Six days later, British forces began to occupy the city, after which retreating Indonesian Republican forces retaliated by killing between 130 and 300 Japanese prisoners. Five hundred Japanese and 2,000 Indonesians had been killed, and the Japanese had almost captured the city when British forces arrived.

The province of Central Java was formed on 15 August 1950, excluding Yogyakarta but including Surakarta. There has been no significant changes in the administrative division of the province ever since. In the aftermath of the 30 September Movement in 1965, an anti-communist purge took place in Central Java, in which the army and community vigilante groups killed Communists and leftists, both actual and alleged. Others were interned in concentration camps, the most infamous of which was on the isle of Buru in Maluku, first used as a place of political exile by the Dutch. Some were executed years later, but most were released in 1979 In 1998, near the downfall of Suharto, anti-Chinese violence broke out in Surakarta (Solo) and surrounding areas, in which Chinese property and other buildings were burnt down. The following year, public buildings in Surakarta were burnt by supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri after Indonesia&#x27;s parliament chose Abdurrahman Wahid instead of Megawati for the presidency.

The 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake in the south and Yogyakarta devastated many buildings and caused thousands of deaths and more than injuries.

== Geography ==
According to the slope level of land in Central Java, 38% of the land has a slope of 0–2%, 31% has a slope of 2–15%, 19% has a slope of 15–40%, and the remaining 12% has a slope of more than 40%.

The northern coastal region of Central Java has a narrow lowland. In the Brebes area, it is 40 km wide from the coast, while in Semarang, it is only 4 km wide. This plain continues with the depression of Semarang-Rembang in the east. Mount Muria at the end of the Ice Age (around 10,000 years BC) was a separate island from Java, which eventually fused because of alluvial deposits from flowing rivers. The city of Demak during the era of the Demak Sultanate was on the edge of the sea and became a thriving port. This sedimentation process is still ongoing on the coast of Semarang.

In the south of the area are the Northern Cretaceous Mountains and the Kendeng Mountains, which are limestone mountains stretching from the east of Semarang from the Southwest end of Pati then east to the Lamongan and Bojonegoro in East Java.

The main range of mountains in Central Java is the North and South Serayu Mountains. The North forms a mountain chain that connects the Bogor range in West Java with the Kendeng Mountains in the east. The width of this mountain range is around 30–50 km; on the western end there is Mount Slamet, which is the highest mountain in Central Java as well as the second-highest mountain in Java, and the eastern part is the Dieng Plateau with peaks of Mount Prahu and Mount Ungaran. Between the series of North and South Serayu Mountains are separated by the Serayu Depression which stretches from Majenang in the Cilacap Regency, Purwokerto, to Wonosobo. East of this depression is the Sindoro and Sumbing volcano, and the east again (Magelang and Temanggung areas) is a continuation of depression which limits Mount Merapi and Mount Merbabu.

The Southern Serayu Mountains are part of the South Central Java Basin located in the southern part of the province. This mandala is a geoantiklin that extends from west to east along 100 kilometres and is divided into two parts separated by the Jatilawang valley, namely the western and eastern regions. The western part is formed by Mount Kabanaran (360 m) and can be described as having the same elevation as the Bandung Depression Zone in West Java or as a new structural element in Central Java. This section is separated from the Bogor Zone by the Majenang Depression.

The eastern part was built by the Ajibarang anticline (narrow anticline) which was cut by the Serayu River stream. In the east of Banyumas, the anticline developed into an anticlinorium with a width reaching 30 km in the Lukulo area (south of Banjarnegara-Midangan) or often called the &quot;Kebumen Tinggi&quot;. At the very eastern end of Mandala, the South Serayu Mountains are formed by the dome of the Kulonprogo Mountains (1022 m), which is located between Purworejo and the Progo River.

The area of the south coast of Central Java also has a narrow lowland, with a width of 10–25 km. In addition, there are South Gombong Karst Areas. Sloping hills stretch parallel to the coast, from Yogyakarta to Cilacap. East of Yogyakarta is a limestone mountain area that extends to the southern coast of East Java.

=== Hydrology ===

The rivers that empty into the Java Sea include the Bengawan Solo River, Kali Pemali, Kali Comal, and Kali Bodri, while the ones that empty into the Indian Ocean include Serayu River, Bogowonto River, Luk Ulo River and Progo River. Bengawan Solo is the longest river on the island of Java (572 km); has a spring in the Sewu Mountains (Wonogiri Regency), this river flows to the north, crosses the City of Surakarta, and finally goes to East Java and empties into the Gresik area (near Surabaya).

Among the main reservoirs (lakes) in Central Java are Gunung Rowo Lake (Pati Regency), Gajahmungkur Reservoir (Wonogiri Regency), Kedungombo Reservoir (Boyolali and Sragen Regency), Rawa Pening Lake (Semarang Regency), Cacaban Reservoir (Tegal Regency), Malahayu Reservoir (Brebes Regency), Wadaslintang Reservoir (border of Kebumen Regency and Wonosobo Regency), Gembong Reservoir (Pati Regency), Sempor Reservoir (Kebumen Regency) and Mrica Reservoir (Banjarnegara Regency).

=== Climate ===
The average temperature in Central Java is between and the relative humidity varies between 73% and 94%. While the humidity is high in most low-lying parts of the province, it drops significantly in the upper mountains. The highest average annual rainfall of 3,990 mm with 195 rainy days was recorded in Salatiga.

== Government and Administrative divisions ==

On the eve of the World War II in 1942, Central Java was subdivided into seven residencies (Dutch: &quot;residentie&quot; or plural &quot;residenties&quot;, Javanese &quot;karésiḍènan&quot; or &quot;karésidhènan&quot;) which corresponded more or less with the main regions of this area. These residencies were:
* &quot;Banjoemas&quot;
* &quot;Kedoe&quot;
* &quot;Pekalongan&quot;
* &quot;Semarang&quot;
* &quot;Djapara-Rembang&quot;
* &quot;Gouvernement Soerakarta&quot;
* &quot;Gouvernement Jogjakarta&quot;

The Southeastern (Solo) area used to be the Surakarta Sunanate until the monarchy was unrecognized by the Indonesian government. However, after the local elections in 1957, the role of these residencies were reduced until they finally disappeared. The only major boundary change since the creation of the province took place on 14 June 1965, when a new Batang Regency was formed from the eastern half of Pekalongan Regency.

Today, Central Java (excluding Special Region of Yogyakarta) is divided into 29 regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and six cities (&quot;kota&quot;, previously &quot;kotamadya&quot; and &quot;kota pradja&quot;), the latter being independent of any regency. These contemporary regencies and cities can further be subdivided into 565 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;). These districts are further divided into rural villages (&quot;desa&quot;) and 764 urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;).

=== Central Java regencies and cities ===

Note: The regencies now appear in the formal order prescribed by the Indonesian Central Statistics Board (&quot;Badan Pusat Statistik&quot;), as indicated by the regional codes (&quot;Kode Wilayah&quot;).
=== Central Java electoral districts ===
The province comprises 10 of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the House of Representatives. The province&#x27;s 77 elected members are comprised as follows:

== Demographics ==
As of the 2010 census, Central Java&#x27;s population stood at 32.38 million, barely increasing from 2000, compared with the 1990 census when the population was 28 million. This reflected an increase of approximately 13.5% in 20 years. At the 2020 Census the population was 36,516,035, and the official estimate for mid 2023 was 37,608,336. Birthrates had not plunged between 2000 and 2010, instead losses due to domestic outmigration on 2010 figures, reversed themselves in 2020 with pandemic &quot;back to kampung&quot; influence.

The three biggest regencies in terms of population are: Brebes, Cilacap and Banyumas. Together they make up approximately 16% of the province&#x27;s population. Major urban population centres include Greater Semarang, Greater Surakarta and the Brebes-Tegal-Slawi area in the northwest of the province.

===Religion===


Although the overwhelming majority of Javanese are Muslims, many also profess indigenous Javanese beliefs. Clifford Geertz, in his book about the religion of Java, made a distinction between the so-called &quot;santri&quot; Javanese and &quot;abangan&quot; Javanese. He considered the former as orthodox Muslims and the latter as nominal Muslims that devote more energy to indigenous traditions.

Dutch Protestants were active in missionary activities and were rather successful. The Dutch Catholic Jesuit missionary, F.G.C. van Lith also achieved some success, especially in areas around the central-southern parts of Central Java and Yogyakarta at the beginning of the 20th century, and is buried at the Jesuit necropolis at Muntilan.

Following the upheavals in 1965–66, religious identification of citizens became compulsory, and there has been a renaissance of Buddhism and Hinduism since then. As one has to choose a religion out of the five official religions in Indonesia; i.e. Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, and Buddhism, the latter two became alternatives for people who did not want to be Muslims or Christians. Confucianism is also common among Chinese Indonesians. In the post-Suharto era, it is recognised as an official religion along with the aforementioned five.

=== Ethnicity ===
At approximately 98%, Javanese people form the overwhelming majority of the population, and a minority of the Sundanese people. Central Java is known as the centre of Javanese culture. The cities of Surakarta and Yogyakarta are the centres of the Javanese royal palace that still stands today.

Significant minority ethnic groups include the Chinese Indonesians. They usually reside in urban areas, although they are also found in rural areas. In general, they primarily work in trade and services. Many speak the Javanese language with sufficient fluency as they have lived alongside the Javanese. One can feel the strong influence in Semarang and the town of Lasem in Rembang Regency, which is on the northeastern tip of Central Java. Even Lasem is nicknamed &quot;Le petit chinois&quot; or the Small Chinese City. The urban areas that are densely populated by Chinese Indonesians are called &quot;pecinan&quot;, which means &quot;Chinatown&quot;. Additionally, in several major cities, the Arab-Indonesian community can also be found. Similar to the Chinese community, they are usually engaged in trade and services.

In areas bordering the province of West Java, there are Sundanese people and Sundanese culture, especially in the Cilacap, Brebes, and Banyumas regions. Sundanese toponyms are common in these regions such as Dayeuhluhur in Cilacap, Ciputih and Citimbang in Brebes and even Cilongok as far away in Banyumas. In the interior of Blora, which borders East Java, there is an isolated Samin community, the case of which is almost the same as the Baduy people in Banten.

=== Language ===

Although Indonesian is the official language, people mostly speak Javanese as their daily language. The Solo-Jogja dialect or the Mataram dialect is considered as the standard Javanese Language.

Additionally, there are a number of Javanese dialects but in general, it consists of two, namely &quot;kulonan&quot; and &quot;timuran&quot;. The former is spoken in the western part of Central Java, consisting of the Banyumasan dialects and Tegal dialects (also called &quot;Basa Ngapak)&quot;. They are quite different in pronunciation from the standard Javanese. The latter dialect is spoken in the eastern part of the province, including the Mataram dialect (Solo-Jogja), Semarang dialect, and the Pati dialect. Between the borders of the two dialects, Javanese is spoken with a mixture of both dialects; these areas are Pekalongan and the Kedu Plain, which composes Magelang and Temanggung.

===Sundanese language===
Some parts of the districts of Brebes and Cilacap speak Sundanese, the western part of Central Java is the border between the Javanese people and Sundanese people worlds in the western of Java.

== Culture ==

Central Java is considered to be the heart of the Javanese culture. The ideal conduct and moral of the courts (such as politeness, nobility and grace) has a tremendous influence on the people. They are known as soft-spoken, very polite, extremely class-conscious, apathetic, down-to-earth, etc. These stereotypes form what most non-Javanese see as the &quot;Javanese Culture&quot;, when in fact, not all Javanese behave in such manner as most Javanese are far from the court culture.

=== Mapping the Javanese cultures ===
The Javanese cultural area can be divided into three distinct main regions: Western, Central, and Eastern Javanese culture or in their Javanese names as &quot;Ngapak&quot;, &quot;Kejawèn&quot; and &quot;Arèk&quot;. The boundaries of these cultural regions coincide with the isoglosses of the Javanese dialects. Cultural areas west of Dieng Plateau and Pekalongan Regency are considered &quot;Ngapak&quot; whereas the border of the eastern cultural areas or &quot;Arèk&quot; lies in East Java. Consequently, culturally, Central Java consists of two cultures, while the Central Javanese Culture proper is not entirely confined to Central Java.

=== Creative arts ===
==== Architecture ====

The architecture of Central Java is characterised by the juxtaposition of the old and the new and a wide variety of architectural styles, the legacy of many successive influences from the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, China, and Europe. In particular, northern coastal cities such as Semarang, Tegal, and Pekalongan can boast European colonial architecture. The European and Chinese influence can be seen in Semarang&#x27;s temple of Sam Poo Kong dedicated to Zheng He and the Domed Church built in 1753. The latter is the second-oldest church in Java and the oldest in Central Java. In the former capital of Surakarta, there are also several European architectures.

Central Java also has some notable religious buildings. The Borobudur and the Prambanan temple complexes are among the largest Buddhist and Hindu structures in the world. In general, a characteristic Javanese mosque does not have a dome as its roof but a &quot;Meru&quot;-like roof which is reminiscent of a Hindu or Buddhist temple. The tower of the famous Mosque of Kudus resembles a Hindu-Javanese or Balinese temple more than a traditional Middle Eastern mosque.

==== Batik ====

Central Java is famous and well known for its exquisite &quot;batik&quot;, a generic wax-resist dyeing technique used on textiles. There are different styles of batik motifs. A centre of batik production is in Pekalongan. Other centres include Surakarta and Yogyakarta. &quot;Batik&quot; in Pekalongan style, which represent &quot;gaya pesisir&quot; (or coastal style), is different from the one in Surakarta and Yogyakarta that represent &quot;batik&quot; from the heartland of Java (&quot;gaya kejawèn&quot;).

==== Dance ====

One can even see the court influences in the art forms. The dances of the courts of Java are usually slow and graceful with no excessive gestures. The people followed this approach, and as a result, slow-paced and graceful movements can even be found in folk dances throughout Central Java, though with some exceptions. One can enjoy the beauty of Central Javanese dances in &quot;Kamajaya-Kamaratih&quot; or &quot;Karonsih&quot;, usually performed in a traditional Javanese wedding.

==== Theatre ====
There are several kinds of Central Javanese theatre and performing arts. The most well-known is the Javanese &quot;wayang&quot; theatre, which has several types. These are &quot;wayang kulit&quot;, &quot;wayang klitik&quot;, &quot;wayang beber&quot;, &quot;wayang golek&quot;, and &quot;wayang wong&quot;. &quot;Wayang kulit&quot; are shadow puppets theatre with leather puppets. The stories are loosely based on the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot; cycles. &quot;Wayang klitik&quot; are puppets theatre with flat wooden puppets. The stories are based on Panji stories. Panji was a native Javanese princes who embarked a &#x27;journeys of desire&#x27;. &quot;Wayang beber&quot; is scroll theatre, and it involves &quot;performing&quot; scenes of a story elaborately drawn and painted on rolled sheets. &quot;Wayang golek&quot; consists of three-dimensional wooden puppets. The narrative can be based on anything, but usually are drawn from Islamic heroic ones. Finally, &quot;wayang wong&quot; is &quot;wayang&quot; theatre involving live figures, actors who are performing a play. The narrative, however, must be based on the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; or the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

In addition to &quot;wayang&quot;, there is another form of theatre called &quot;ketoprak&quot;. It is a staged play by actors accompanied by Javanese &quot;gamelan&quot;. The narrative is free but cannot be based on Mahabharata or Ramayana.

==== Music ====
Central Javanese music is almost synonymous with &quot;gamelan&quot;. It is a musical ensemble typically featuring a variety of instruments such as metallophones, xylophones, drums, gongs, bamboo flutes, bowed and plucked strings. Vocalists may also be included. The term refers more to the set of instruments than the players of those instruments. A gamelan as a set of instruments is a distinct entity, built and tuned to stay together. Instruments from different gamelan are not interchangeable. However, gamelan is not typically Central Javanese as it is also known elsewhere.

Contemporary Javanese pop music is called &quot;campursari&quot;. It is a fusion between gamelan and Western instruments, much like &quot;kroncong&quot;. Usually, the lyrics are in Javanese, though not always. One notable singer is Didi Kempot, born in Sragen, north of Surakarta. He mostly sings in Javanese.

==== Literature ====
It can be argued that Javanese literature started in Central Java. The oldest-known literary work in the Javanese language is the inscription of Sivagrha from Kedu Plain. This inscription, which is from 856 AD, is written as a &quot;kakawin&quot; or Javanese poetry with Indian metres. The oldest of narrative poems, &quot;Kakawin Ramayana&quot;, which tells the well-known story of Ramayana, is believed to have come from Central Java. It can be safely assumed that this &quot;kakawin&quot; were written in the central Java region in the 9th century.

After the shift of Javanese power to eastern Java, it had been quiet from Central Java for several centuries concerning Javanese literature until the 16th century. At this time, the centre of power was shifted back to Central Java. The oldest work written in modern Javanese language concerning Islam is the so-called &quot;Book of Bonang&quot; or also &quot;The Admonitions of Seh Bari&quot;. This work is extant in just one manuscript, now kept in the University of Leiden as codex Orientalis 1928. It is assumed that this manuscript originates from Tuban, in eastern Java and was taken to the Netherlands after 1598. However, this work is attributed to Sunan Bonang, one of the nine Javanese saints who spread Islam in Java and Sunan Bonang came from Bonang, a place in Demak Regency, Central Java. It can be argued that this work marked the beginning of Islamic literature in the region.

However, the pinnacle of Central Javanese literature was created at the courts of the kings of Mataram in Kartasura and later in Surakarta and Yogyakarta that are mostly attributed to the Yasadipura family. The most famous member of this family is Rangga Warsita who lived in the 19th century. He is the best-known of all Javanese writers and also one of the most prolific. He is also known as &quot;bujangga panutup&quot; or &quot;the last court poet&quot;.

Following independence, the Javanese language as a medium was pushed to the background. Still, one of the greatest contemporary Indonesian authors, Pramoedya Ananta Toer was born in 1925 in Blora. He was an author of novels, short stories, essays, polemics, and histories of his homeland and its people. A well-regarded writer in the West, his outspoken and often politically charged writings faced censorship at home. He faced extrajudicial punishment for opposing the policies of both President Sukarno and Suharto. During imprisonment and house arrest, he became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for advocates of freedom of expression and human rights. In his works, he writes much about life and social problems in Java.

=== Cuisine ===
Rice is the staple food of Central Java. In addition to rice, dried cassava, known locally as &quot;gaplèk&quot;, also serve as a staple food. Javanese food tends to taste sweet. Cooked and stewed vegetables, usually in coconut milk (&quot;santen&quot; in Javanese) are prevalent. Raw vegetable, which is popular in West Java, is less prevalent in Central Java.

Saltwater fish, both fresh and dried are common, especially among coastal areas. Freshwater fish is not popular in Central Java, unlike in West Java, except perhaps for catfish known locally as &quot;lélé&quot;. It is usually fried and served with chilli condiment (&quot;sambal&quot;) and raw vegetables.

Chicken, mutton and beef are common meat. Certain parts of the population also eat dog meat, known by its euphemism &quot;daging jamu&quot; (literally &quot;traditional medicine meat&quot;).

Tofu and tempe serve as the standard replacement to fish and meat. Famous dishes in Central Java include &quot;gudeg&quot; (sweet stew of jackfruit) and &quot;sayur lodeh&quot; (vegetables cooked in coconut milk).

Besides the aforementioned tofu, there is a strong Chinese influence in numerous dishes. Some examples of Sino-Javanese food include noodles, &quot;bakso&quot; (meatballs), &quot;lumpia&quot;, &quot;soto&quot; etc. The widespread use of sweet soybeans sauce (&quot;kecap manis&quot;) in the Javanese cuisine can also be attributed to the Chinese influence.
== Transportation ==

Central Java is connected to the Trans-Java Toll Road which currently runs from Merak in Banten to Probolinggo (planned: Banyuwangi), East-Java. Within the province the toll road starts at Brebes, continuing via Semarang then turn southeast to Surakarta until east of Sragen. Along the north coast east of Semarang, the North Coast Road (&quot;Jalur Pantai Utara&quot; or &quot;Jalur Pantura&quot;) is the main road. Losari, the Central Javanese gate at the western border on the northern coast, could be reached from Jakarta in 4 hours drive. On the southern coast, there is also a national way which run from Kroya at the Sundanese-Javanese border, through Yogyakarta to Surakarta and then to Surabaya via Kertosono in East Java. There is furthermore a direct connection from Tegal to Purwokerto and from Semarang to Yogyakarta and Surakarta.

Central Java was the province that first introduced a railway line in Indonesia. The very first line began in 1873 between Semarang and Yogyakarta by a private company, but this route is now no longer used. Today there are five lines in Central Java: the northern line which runs from Jakarta via Semarang to Surabaya. Then there is the southern line from Kroya through Yogyakarta and Surakarta to Surabaya. There is also a train service between Semarang and Surakarta and a service between Kroya and Cirebon. At last there is a route between Surakarta and Wonogiri. The line between Kutoarjo and Surakarta, the line from Cirebon to Purwokerto up to Kroya and the entire north coast line (since 2014) are double-track, while second tracks from Surakarta to Kertosono (towards Surabaya) and Purwokerto-Kroya-Kutoarjo are under construction of which the latter will be finished in 2019
. Other lines are single-track.

On the northern coast Central Java is served by 8 harbours. The main port is Tanjung Mas in Semarang, other harbours are located in Brebes, Tegal, Pekalongan, Batang, Jepara, Juwana and Rembang. The southern coast is mainly served by the port Tanjung Intan in Cilacap.

Finally on mainland Central Java there are five commercial airports. There is one additional commercial airport on the Karimunjawa isles. The airports on the mainland are: Adisumarmo International Airport in Surakarta, Jenderal Ahmad Yani International Airport in Semarang, Ngloram Airport in Cepu, Blora, General Sudirman Airport in Purbalingga and Tunggul Wulung Airport in Cilacap. Karimunjawa is served by Dewadaru Airport.

Economic growth in the province is quite rapid and GDP is forecast to reach $US 180 billion by 2015. The poverty rate of its people is 13% and will be decreased below 6%.

=== Agriculture ===

Much of Central Java is a fertile agricultural region. The primary food crop is wet rice. An elaborate irrigation network of canals, dams, aqueducts, and reservoirs has greatly contributed to Central Java&#x27;s the rice-growing capacity over the centuries. In 2001, productivity of rice was 5,022 kilograms/ha, mostly provided from irrigated paddy field (± 98%). Klaten Regency had the highest productivity with 5525 kilograms/ha.

Other crops, also mostly grown in lowland areas on small peasant landholdings, are corn (maize), cassava, peanuts (groundnuts), soybeans, and sweet potatoes. Terraced hillslopes and irrigated paddy fields are familiar features of the landscape. Kapok, sesame, vegetables, bananas, mangoes, durian fruits, citrus fruits, and vegetable oils are produced for local consumption. Tea, coffee, tobacco, rubber, sugarcane and kapok; and coconuts are exported. Several of these cash crops at a time are usually grown on large family estates. Livestock, especially water buffalo, is raised primarily for use as draft animals. Salted and dried fish are imported.

== Coat of arms and symbols ==
The motto of Central Java is &quot;Prasetya Ulah Sakti Bhakti Praja&quot;. This is a Javanese phrase meaning &quot;A vow of devotion with all might to the country&quot;. The coat of arms of Central Java depicts a legendary flask, &quot;Kundi Amerta&quot; or &quot;Cupu Manik&quot;, formed in a pentagon representing Pancasila. In the centre of the emblem stands a sharp bamboo spike (representing the fight for independence, and it has 8 sections which represent Indonesia&#x27;s month of Independence) with a golden five-pointed star (representing faith in God), superimposed on the black profile of a &quot;candi&quot; (temple) with seven &quot;stupas&quot;, while the middle stupa is the biggest. This &quot;candi&quot; is reminiscent of the Borobudur. Under the &quot;candi&quot; wavy outlines of waters are visible. Behind the &quot;candi&quot; two golden mountain tops are visible.

These twin mountains represents the unity between the people and their government. The emblem shows a green sky above the &quot;candi&quot;. Above, the shield is adorned with a red and white ribbon, the colours of the Indonesian flag. Lining the left and right sides of the shield are respectively stalk of rice (17 of them, representing Indonesia&#x27;s day of Independence) and cotton flowers (5 of them, each one is 4-petaled, representing Indonesia&#x27;s year of Independence). At the bottom, the shield is adorned with a golden red ribbon. On the ribbon the name &quot;Central Java&quot; (&quot;Jawa Tengah&quot;) is inscribed in black. The floral symbol of the province is the &quot;Michelia alba&quot;, while the provincial fauna is &quot;Oriolus chinensis&quot;.

<text>West Sumatra () is a province of Indonesia. It is on the west coast of the island of Sumatra and includes the Mentawai Islands off that coast. West Sumatra borders the Indian Ocean to the west, as well as the provinces of North Sumatra to the north, Riau to the northeast, Jambi to the southeast, and Bengkulu to the south. The province has an area of , or about the same size as Switzerland, with a population of 5,534,472 at the 2020 census. The official estimate at mid 2023 was 5,757,210 (comprising 2,900,270 males and 2,856,940 females). The province is subdivided into twelve regencies and seven cities. It has relatively more cities than other provinces outside Java, although several of them are relatively low in population compared with cities elsewhere in Indonesia. &quot;&quot; is the province&#x27;s capital and largest city.

West Sumatra is home to the Minangkabau people, although the traditional Minangkabau region is actually wider than the province&#x27;s boundaries, covering up to the western coast of North Sumatra, the southwestern coast of Aceh, the western region of Riau, the western region of Jambi, the northern region of Bengkulu, and in Malaysia. Another native ethnic group is the Mentawai people, who inhabit the western islands of the same name. Islam is a predominant religion in the province, with about 97.4% of the total population.

West Sumatra was the centre of the Pagaruyung Kingdom, founded by Adityawarman in 1347. The first European to come to the region was a French traveler named Jean Parmentier who arrived around 1523. The region was later colonised by the Dutch Empire and became a residency named Sumatra&#x27;s West Coast (), whose administrative area included the present-day Kampar Regency in Riau and Kerinci Regency in Jambi. Before becoming a province in 1957, West Sumatra was a part of the province of Central Sumatra (1948–1957), alongside Riau, Jambi, and the Riau Islands.

== Etymology ==
West Sumatra is known by the name &quot;Bumi Minangkabau&quot; (Land of Minangkabau), as it is the home and origin of the Minangkabau people. The &quot;Minangkabau&quot; name comes from two words namely, &quot;Minang&quot; (win) and &quot;Kabau&quot; (cattle). The name is associated with a Minangkabau legend known as &quot;Tambo&quot;. From the &quot;Tambo&quot;, it is said that at one time there was a foreign kingdom (usually interpreted as the Majapahit Empire) which came from the sea and would conquer what is now West Sumatra. To prevent fighting in the region, the local people propose a cattle race competition with the foreign forces. The foreign forces agreed and sent a large and aggressive cattle to the competition, while the local community sent a cattle calf who was still breastfeeding to the competition. In the competition, the cattle calf who was still breastfeeding thought the large and aggressive cattle was the mother. So the calf immediately ran towards the large and aggressive cattle to find milk until he tore apart the big cattle&#x27;s stomach. The victory inspired the local people to use the name &quot;Minangkabau,&quot; which comes from the phrase &quot;Manang kabau&quot; (winning cattle). The story of the Tambo is also found in the which also mentions that the victory made the country that was previously named &quot;Pariangan&quot; changed to the name &quot;Minangkabau&quot;. Furthermore, the use of the name &quot;Minangkabau&quot; is also used to refer to a &quot;nagari&quot; (village), namely the &quot;Nagari Minangkabau&quot;, which is located in Sungayang District, Tanah Datar Regency.

In the historical record of the Majapahit Empire, which dated from 1365, also mentioned the name &quot;Minangkabwa&quot; as one of the Malay countries that has been conquered by the Majapahit. Likewise in the Ming Chronicles from 1405, there was the royal name of &quot;Mi-nang-ge-bu&quot; of the six kingdoms who sent messengers facing Yongle Emperor in Nanjing. On the other hand, the name &quot;Minang&quot; (Minanga kingdom) itself has also been mentioned in the Kedukan Bukit inscription dated from 682 which is written in Sanskrit. In the inscription, it was stated that the founder of the Srivijaya Empire named Dapunta Hyang departed from a place called &quot;Minānga&quot;. Some experts who refer to the source of the inscription suspects that the 4th line words (... &quot;minānga&quot;) and the 5th line words (&quot;tāmvan&quot; ...) are actually incorporated, so that they become &quot;mināngatāmvan&quot; and are translated as the meeting point of twin rivers. The twin river is supposed to refer to the meeting of two sources of the Kampar River, namely the Kampar Kiri River and the Kampar Kanan River. But this hypothesis is denied by the Dutch indologist Johannes Gijsbertus de Casparis, which proves that &quot;tāmvan&quot; has nothing to do with &quot;meeting point&quot;, because these can also be found in other Srivijaya relics.

==History==
=== Prehistoric era ===
From the stories of the &quot;tambo&quot; passed from generation to generation, the ancestors of the Minangkabau people were the descendants of Iskandar Zulkarnain (Alexander the Great). This tambo story is more or less comparable to the Malay Annals who also tells how the Minangkabau people sent their representatives to ask Sang Sapurba, one of the descendants of Iskandar Zulkarnain, to become their king.

The Minang community is part of the Deutro-Malay community who migrated from Southern China to the island of Sumatra around 2,500–2,000 years ago. It is estimated that this community group entered from the east of the island of Sumatra, along the Kampar River to the highlands called &quot;darek&quot; which became the home of the Minangkabau people. Some of these &quot;darek&quot; areas then form a kind of confederation known as &quot;luhak&quot;, which is then referred to as &quot;Luhak Nan Tigo&quot;, which consists of &quot;Luhak Tanah Data&quot;, &quot;Luhak Agam&quot;, and &quot;Luhak Limopuluah Koto&quot;. During the era of the Dutch East Indies, the &quot;luhak&quot; area became a territorial government area called &quot;afdeling&quot;, headed by a resident who by the Minangkabau community was called the name &quot;Tuan Luhak.&quot; Initially, The Minangkabau people were included as a sub-group of the Malays, but since the 19th century, the Minangkabau and the Malays began to be seen as distinguished, from the matrilineal culture of the Minangkabau that persisted compared to the patrilineal culture adopted by Malay society in general.

=== Precolonial era ===
According to the Minangkabau &quot;Tambo&quot;, in the period between the 1st century to the 16th century, many small kingdoms stood on what is now West Sumatra. These kingdoms included the Kuntu, Kandis, Siguntur, Pasumayan Koto Batu, Batu Patah, Sungai Pagu, Inderapura, Jambu Lipo, Taraguang, Dusun Tuo, Bungo Setangkai, Talu, Kinali, Parit Batu, Pulau Punjung. These kingdoms were short lived, and are usually under the influence of larger kingdoms, such as Malayu and Pagaruyung.

The Malayu Kingdom is estimated to have appeared in the year 645 thought to be located in the upper reaches of the Batang Hari River. Based on the Kedukan Bukit inscription, this kingdom was conquered by the Srivijaya in 682. And then in 1183 it appeared again based on the Grahi inscription in Cambodia, and then the &quot;Negarakertagama&quot; and &quot;Pararaton&quot; recorded the existence of the Malay Kingdom which had its capital in Dharmasraya. A military expedition to West Sumatra called the Pamalayu emerged in 1275–1293 under the leadership of Kebo Anabrang of the Singasari Kingdom. After the submission of the kingdom recorded on the &quot;Amoghapasa&quot; carved on the Padang Roco Inscription, the Pamalayu returned to Java with the daughters of King Dharmasraya, Dara Petak and Dara Jingga. Dara Petak was married to Raden Wijaya, the king of Majapahit, as well as the heir to the Singhasari kingdom, while Dara Jingga was married to Adwayawarman. Jayanagara was born from the marriage of Raden Wijaya and Dara Petak, who would become the second king of Majapahit, while Adityawarman was born from the marriage of Dara Jingga and Adwayawarman; he later became king of the Pagaruyung Kingdom.

Hindu-Buddhist influence in western Sumatra emerged around the 13th century, and began during the Pamalayu expedition by Kertanagara, and later during the reign of Adityawarman and his son Ananggawarman. Adityawarman&#x27;s kingdom had the strength to dominate the central Sumatra region and its surrounding. This was proven by the title &quot;Maharajadiraja&quot; which was held by Adityawarman recorded on the back of the Amoghapasa carving, found in the upper reaches of the Batang Hari River (now part of the Dharmasraya Regency). The Batusangkar inscription mentioned Ananggawarman as a yuvaraja performing the Tantris teaching ritual from Buddhism called hevajra which is the ceremony of the transfer of power from Adityawarman to his crown prince, this can be attributed to the Chinese chronicle of 1377 about the &quot;San-fo-ts&#x27;i&quot; messenger to the Emperor of China requesting recognition as ruler of the &quot;San-fo-ts&#x27;i&quot; region. Some inland areas of central Sumatra are still influenced by Buddhism, evident in the Padangroco temple, the Padanglawas temple and Muara Takus temple, the areas that were formerly part of Adityawarman&#x27;s land. Whereas the recorded devout adherents besides Adityawarman, were Kublai Khan and king Kertanegara of Singhasari.

The spread of Islam after the end of the 14th century had little effect, especially relating to the patrilineal system, and gave a relatively new phenomenon to the people in the interior of Minangkabau. At the beginning of the 16th century, the &quot;Suma Oriental&quot;, written between 1513 and 1515, recorded from the three Minangkabau kings, only one of whom had been a Muslim convert from 15 years before. The influence of Islam in Pagaruyung developed around the 16th century, namely through travelers and religious teachers who stopped or came from Aceh and Malacca. One of the famous ulama of Aceh, Abd al-Rauf al-Sinkili, was a cleric who was thought to first spread Islam in Pagaruyung. By the 17th century, the Kingdom of Pagaruyung transformed itself into an Islamic sultanate. The first Islamic king in the Minangkabau traditional culture was Sultan Alif.

With the entry of Islam, the customary rules that are contrary to the teachings of Islam began to be replaced with the Islamic-based customary law. There is a famous Minangkabau custom proverb, &quot;Adat basandi syarak, syarak basandi Kitabullah&quot;, which means that the Minangkabau adat is based on Islam, while Islam is based on the Qur&#x27;an. But in some cases, several systems and methods of adat were still maintained causing the outbreak of civil war known as the Padri War. The war was initially between the ulamas and the &quot;Adats&quot;, who were the Minangkabau nobility and traditional chiefs; later, the Dutch involved themselves in the war.

Islam also had an influence on Pagaruyung kingdom&#x27;s government system with the addition of government elements such as &quot;Tuan Kadi&quot; and several other terms related to Islam. The naming of the Sumpur Kudus District, which contains the words derived from the word &quot;Quduus&quot; (holy) as the seat of &quot;Rajo Ibadat&quot; and &quot;Limo Kaum&quot; which contains the word &quot;qaum&quot; is an influence from Arabic or Islam. In addition, in the &quot;adat&quot;, the term &quot;Imam&quot;, &quot;Katik&quot; (Khatib), &quot;Bila&quot; (Bilal), &quot;Malin&quot; (Mu&#x27;alim), which is a substitute for Hindu and Buddhist terms used previously, such as the term &quot;Pandito&quot; (priest), also appears.

=== Colonial era ===


At the beginning of the 17th century, the Pagaruyung Kingdom was forced to recognize the sovereignty of the Aceh Sultanate, and to recognize the designated Aceh governors for the west coast of Sumatra. But around 1665, the Minangkabau people on the west coast rebelled against the Aceh governor. From the letter of the Minangkabau ruler Raja Pagaruyung submitted a request to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and the VOC at that time took the opportunity to end Aceh&#x27;s monopoly on gold and pepper. Furthermore, the VOC through its regent in Padang, Jacob Pits whose territory included from Kotawan in the south to Barus in the north sent a letter dated October 9, 1668 addressed to the Ahmadsyah Sultan, Iskandar Zur-Karnain, the Minangkabau ruler who was rich in gold, was told the VOC controlled the west coast area so that the gold trade can be re-flowed through the coast. According to Dutch records, Sultan Ahmadsyah died in 1674 and was replaced by his son Sultan Indermasyah. When the VOC succeeded in expelling the Aceh Sultanate from the coast of West Sumatra in 1666, Aceh&#x27;s influence weakened on Pagaruyung. The relationship between the outer regions and the coast with the Kingdom of Pagaruyung becomes closer. At the time Pagaruyung was one of the trading centers on the island of Sumatra, due to its production of gold, it attracted the attention of the Dutch and the British to establish relations with Pagaruyung. It is recorded that in 1684, a Portuguese explorer named Tomas Dias paid a visit to Pagaruyung at the behest of the Dutch governor general in Malacca.

Around 1750 the Pagaruyung kingdom began to dislike the presence of the VOC in Padang and once tried to persuade the British who were in Bengkulu to expel the Dutch from the region which the British did not respond to. But in 1781, the British managed to control Padang for a short period of time, and messengers from Pagaruyung congratulated the success of the British in expelling the Dutch from Padang. Minangkabau land has long been considered rich in gold, and at that time the power of the Minangkabau king was divided into king &quot;Suruaso&quot; and the king of &quot;Sungai Tarab&quot; with the equal power. Previously in 1732, the VOC regent in Padang had noted that there was a queen named &quot;Yang Dipertuan Puti Jamilan&quot; who had sent spears and swords made from gold, as a sign of her inauguration as the ruler of the land. While the Dutch and British succeeded in reaching the interior of the Minangkabau region, they had never found significant gold reserves in the area.

As a result of the conflict between the British and French in the Napoleonic Wars where the Dutch were on the French side, the British fought the Dutch and again succeeded in taking control of the coast of West Sumatra between 1795 and 1819. The British governor Thomas Stamford Raffles visited Pagaruyung in 1818, when the Padri War began. At that time Raffles discovered that the capital city of the kingdom had been burned because of the war. After the signing of a peace agreement between the British and the Netherlands was signed in 1814, the Dutch re-entered Padang in May 1819. The Dutch reaffirmed their influence on the island of Sumatra and Pagaruyung, with the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. The power of the king of Pagaruyung was very weak in the days leading up to the Padri war, although the king was still respected by his subject. The areas on the western coast fell into the influence of Aceh, while Inderapura on the southern coast practically became an independent kingdom although officially still under the rule of the king of Pagaruyung.

In the early 19th century a conflict broke out between the &quot;Padri&quot; and the &quot;Adat&quot;. In several negotiations there was no agreement between them. Pagaruyung&#x27;s kingdom was in turmoil, and the peak of the war was when the Padri under the leadership of Tuanku Pasaman attacked Pagaruyung in 1815. Sultan Arifin Muningsyah was forced to abdicate and escape from the royal capital to Lubuk Jambi. Under pressure by the Padri, the Pagaruyung royal family requested assistance from the Dutch, and before that they had conducted diplomacy with the British when Raffles visited Pagaruyung and promised them assistance. On February 10, 1821, Sultan Tangkal Alam Bagagarsyah, the nephew of Sultan Arifin Muningsyah, in Padang along with 19 other traditional leaders signed an agreement with the Dutch to cooperate in fighting the Padri, even though he was considered not entitled to make an agreement on behalf of the kingdom of Pagaruyung. As a result of this agreement, the Netherlands considered it a sign of surrender of the kingdom of Pagaruyung to the Dutch government. After the Dutch captured Pagaruyung from the Padri, in 1824 at the request of Lieutenant Colonel Raaff, Sultan Arifin Muningsyah returned to Pagaruyung, but in 1825, Sultan Arifin Muningsyah, the last king in Minangkabau, died and was later buried in Pagaruyung. Sultan Tangkal Alam Bagagarsyah on the other hand wanted to be recognized as the king of Pagaruyung, but the Dutch East Indies government had limited his authority and only appointed him the Regent of Tanah Datar. Because of the policy it encouraged Sultan Tangkal Alam Bagagarsyah to start thinking about expelling the Dutch from the region.

After emerging victorious from the Diponegoro War in Java, the Dutch then tried to conquer the Padri with shipments of soldiers from Java, Madura, Celebes and the Moluccas. But the Dutch colonial ambitions caused the Adat and the Padri to forget their differences in secret to drive the Dutch away. On 2 May 1833 Sultan Tangkal Alam Bagagarsyah was captured by Lieutenant Colonel Elout in Batusangkar on charges of treason. He was exiled to Batavia (present-day Jakarta) until his death, and was buried in the Mangga Dua cemetery. After the fall, the influence and prestige of the kingdom of Pagaruyung remained high, especially among Minangkabau people who were overseas. One of Pagaruyung&#x27;s royal heirs was invited to become a ruler in Kuantan, Malaysia. Likewise when Raffles was still on duty in the Malay Peninsula, he met Pagaruyung&#x27;s relatives who were in Negeri Sembilan, and Raffles intended to appoint Yang Dipertuan Ali Alamsyah who he considered to be the direct descendant of the Minangkabau kings as a king under British protection. After the end of the Padri War, Tuan Gadang of Batipuh asked the Dutch East Indies government to give a higher position than just as the Tanah Datar Regent which he held after replacing Sultan Tangkal Alam Bagagarsyah, but this request was rejected by the Dutch, this later included one of the drivers of the outbreak of the 1841 rebellion in Batipuh in addition to the &quot;cultuurstelsel&quot; problem.

The name West Sumatra originated in the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) era, where the designation of the area for the west coast of Sumatra was &quot;Hoofdcomptoir van Sumatra&#x27;s Westkust&quot;. Then with the strengthening of the political and economic influence of the VOC, until the 18th century this administrative region included the west coast of Sumatra from Barus to Inderapura. Along with the fall of the Kingdom of Pagaruyung, and the involvement of the Dutch in the Padri War, the Dutch East Indies government began to make the interior of Minangkabau a part of &quot;Pax Nederlandica&quot;, an area under Dutch supervision, and the Minangkabau region was divided into the &quot;Residentie Padangsche Benedenlanden&quot; and the &quot;Residentie Padangsche Bovenlanden&quot;. Furthermore, in the development of the colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies, this area was incorporated in the &quot;Gouvernement Sumatra&#x27;s Westkust&quot;, including the &quot;Residentie Bengkulu&quot; region which had just been surrendered by the British to the Dutch. Then expanded again by including Tapanuli and Singkil. But in 1905, the status of Tapanuli was upgraded to &quot;Residentie Tapanuli&quot;, while the Singkil area was given to &quot;Residentie Atjeh&quot;. Then in 1914, &quot;Gouvernement Sumatra&#x27;s Westkust&quot;, was demoted to &quot;Residentie Sumatra&#x27;s Westkust&quot;, and added the Mentawai Islands region in the Indian Ocean into &quot;Residentie Sumatra&#x27;s Westkust,&quot; and in 1935 the Kerinci region was also incorporated into &quot;Residentie Sumatra&#x27;s Westkust.&quot; After the breakdown of the &quot;Gouvernement Sumatra&#x27;s Oostkust&quot;, the Rokan Hulu and Kuantan Singingi regions were given to &quot;Residentie Riouw&quot;, and &quot;Residentie Djambi&quot; was also formed in almost the same period.

=== Japanese occupation and Independence ===

During the Japanese occupation, &quot;Residentie Sumatra&#x27;s Westkust&quot; changed its name to &quot;Sumatora Nishi Kaigan Shu&quot;. On the basis of military geo-strategy, the Kampar area was separated from &quot;Sumatora Nishi Kaigan Shu&quot; and incorporated into the territory of &quot;Rhio Shu&quot;.

At the beginning of Indonesian independence in 1945, the West Sumatra region was incorporated in the Sumatra province based in Bukittinggi. Four years later, Sumatra Province was divided into three provinces: North Sumatra, Central Sumatra, and South Sumatra. West Sumatra, Riau and Jambi were part of the residency within the province of Central Sumatra. During the PRRI rebellion, based on emergency law number 19 of 1957, Central Sumatra Province was further divided into three provinces: West Sumatra Province, Riau Province, and Jambi Province. The Kerinci region which was previously incorporated in the South Sumatra Regency of Kerinci, was incorporated into Jambi Province as a separate regency. Likewise, the Kampar, Rokan Hulu and Kuantan Singingi areas are designated as part of Riau Province.

Communism in Sumatra has historically had an influence in the politics and society of Sumatra. Padang, Pariaman, Silungkang, Sawah Lunto, Alahan Panjang and Suliki of West Sumatra have been cited as areas which were particularly active in communism. During the PRRI rebellion, the insurgents arrested leftist activists and placed them in detention camps in West Sumatra. PKI cadres were detained at Situjuh and Suliki, while followers of the national communist Murba Party and other groups were detained at the Muara Labuh camp. Incidentally, Hadji Abdullah Ahmad, a noted anti-communist and religious leader was from the Minangkabau Highlands, where communism was active. Numerous examples of anti-communist resentment also occurred, for instance during the Indonesian killings of 1965–1966, PKI-organised squatters&#x27; movements and campaigns against foreign businesses in Sumatra&#x27;s plantations provoked quick reprisals against Communists. Repression against alleged PKI members and sympathizers continued for several years. As late as 1976 mass lay-offs of former members of the communist plantation workers&#x27; union Sarbupri members took place in Sumatra, actions motivated by the communist past of these individuals.

==Geography==
West Sumatra lies in the middle of the western coast of Sumatra, and has an area of 42,119.54 km2. Geographic features include plains, mountainous volcanic highlands formed by the Barisan mountain range that runs from north-west to south-east, and an offshore island archipelago called the Mentawai Islands. The West Sumatran coastline faces the Indian Ocean and stretches 375 km from North Sumatra province in the north-west to Bengkulu in the south-east. The lakes of West Sumatra include: Maninjau (99.5 km2), Singkarak (130.1 km2), Diatas (31.5 km2), Dibawah (14.0 km2) and Talang (5.0 km2). Most of the rivers in West Sumatra flow into the Strait of Malacca, include: Batanghari, Kampar, Ombilin and Sinamar, and others flow into the Indian Ocean, include: Kuranji, Anai and Arau. The mountains and volcanoes of West Sumatra include: Kerinci (3,805 m), Talakmau (2,912 m), Marapi (2,891 m), Singgalang (2,877 m), Talang (2,572 m), Tandikat (2,438 m) and Sago (2,271 m).

West Sumatra is one of the earthquake-prone areas in Indonesia, due to its location in the tectonic slab located between the confluence of two major continental plates (the Eurasian Plate and Indo-Australian Plate) and Great Sumatran fault, plus the activity of the active volcanoes. Large earthquakes that occurred recently in West Sumatra earthquake were the 2009 Sumatra earthquake and the 2010 Mentawai earthquake and tsunami. The area was also affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.

This region has a tropical monsoon climate, similar to most other Indonesian provinces. Throughout the year the province is only affected by two seasons, namely the rainy season and the dry season. The air temperature varies from 24.7 to 32.9 degrees Celsius with air humidity levels ranging from 82% to 88%. The relative rainy season falls from October to April. Variation in rainfall ranges from 2,100 mm to 3,264 mm. The month December is the month with the most rainfall. While the dry season usually starts in June to September.

The season in West Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September wind flows from Australia and do not contain much water vapor, resulting in a dry season. Conversely in December to March many wind currents contain water vapor from Asia and the Pacific Ocean during the rainy season. Such conditions occur every half-year after passing the transition period in between April – May and October – November.

The city of Padang is one of Indonesia&#x27;s wettest cities, with frequent rainfall throughout the course of the year.
As in most other province of Indonesia, West Sumatra has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.

=== Flora and Fauna ===
The province includes large areas of dense tropical forest, which is home to a host of species including: &quot;Rafflesia arnoldii&quot; (world&#x27;s largest flower), Sumatran tiger, siamang, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow, rusa deer, Malayan sun bear, Bornean clouded leopard, and many birds and butterflies.
The province includes two national parks: Siberut National Park and Kerinci Seblat National Park, as well as a number of nature reserves: Rimbo Panti Nature Reserve, Batang Palupuh Nature Reserve, Lembah Anai Nature Reserve, Lembah Harau Nature Reserve, Bung Hatta Grand Forest Park, and Beringin Sakti Nature Reserve.

== Government ==
The Province of West Sumatra is led by a governor who is elected directly with his representative for a 5-year term. In addition to being a regional government, the Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010.

While the relationship between the provincial government and the regency and city governments is not a sub-ordinate, each of these regional governments governs and manages government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and co-administration.

=== Nagari ===

Until 1979, the smallest administrative unit in West Sumatra was called a &quot;nagari&quot;, which had existed before Indonesian independence. With the enactment of Law No. 5 of 1979 concerning village governance, the status of nagari was eliminated and replaced with villages, and several jorong statuses were upgraded to villages. The position of nagari guardians was also removed and government administration was carried out by village heads. But since the onset of government reform and regional autonomy, since 2001, the term &quot;nagari&quot; has been used again in this province.

The political culture that lived in the West Sumatra village government since the policy of uniformity (Law No.5 of 1979) was applied to the parochial political culture. this condition is seen through the power system, the ruling system, the terms of the ruler, and the role of the ruler in the village government.

The kinship system in developing participant political culture began to shift, in terms of the level of sensitivity, the form of tolerance in kinship, and the role of seniority in kinship. This means that the lack of togetherness in the kinship power system.

Nagari government is an autonomous government structure, has a clear territory and adheres to adat as a regulator of the life of its members. the regency replaced the term village government that was used previously. Whereas for the nagari in the city government system still as a traditional institution, it has not become part of the regional government structure.

Opportunities that occur in village government are the emergence of individualistic economic growth. This condition is a result of dependence on the central government, resulting in lack of independence. This condition can weaken the resilience of the area of the economy itself. However, now the villages of West Sumatra have tried to build efforts to facilitate the political policies of the village government or since exchanging back into nagari, namely changing the structure and process between village government structures made under Law No. 5 of 1979.

&quot;Nagari&quot; was initially led jointly by the princes or &quot;datuk&quot; in the &quot;nagari&quot;, then during the Dutch East Indies government one of the princes was chosen to become the guardian of the Nagari. Then in running the government, the nagari guardians are assisted by a number of jorong or jorong guardians, but now assisted by the &quot;nagari&quot; secretary and civil servants depending on the needs of each &quot;nagari&quot;. This &quot;nagari&quot; guardian was chosen by the &quot;anak nagari&quot; (nagari residents) democratically in direct elections for 6 years in office.

=== Administrative divisions ===
West Sumatra Province is subdivided into twelve regencies and seven autonomous cities, which lie outside any regency. The regencies and cities are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.

Before the reforms of 1999 and the implementation of regional autonomy in 2001, the lowest local government unit under the district administrations was the Javanese model of the village, the &quot;desa&quot;. Under regional autonomy, the traditional Minangkabau &quot;nagari&quot;, which are larger than villages elsewhere in Indonesia, have been reintroduced in place of the &quot;desa&quot;.

This &quot;rumag Bagonjong&quot; according to the local community was inspired by the&quot;Tambo&quot;, which tells of the arrival of their ancestors by boat from the sea. Another distinctive feature of this traditional house is not using iron nails but using wooden pegs, but strong enough as a binder.

== Cuisine ==

Padang food is the cuisine of the Minangkabau people. Padang food is famous for its rich taste of succulent coconut milk and spicy chili. Minang cuisine put much emphasis in three elements; &quot;gulai&quot; (curry), &quot;lado&quot; (chili pepper) and &quot;bareh&quot; (rice). No traditional Padang meal is complete without the three—spicy chili sauce, thick curry, and perfect steamed rice. Among the cooking traditions in Indonesian cuisine, Minangkabau cuisine and most of Sumatran cuisine, demonstrate Indian and Middle Eastern influences, with dishes cooked in curry sauce with coconut milk and the heavy use of spices mixture.

Because most Minangkabau people are Muslims, Minangkabau cuisine follows halal dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, lamb meat, and poultry and fish. Minangkabau people are known for their fondness of cattle meat products including offal. Almost all the parts of a cattle, such as meat, ribs, tongue, tail, liver, tripe, brain, bone marrow, spleen, intestine, cartilage, tendon, and skin are made to be Minangkabau delicacies. Seafood is popular in coastal West Sumatran cities, and most are grilled or fried with spicy chili sauce or in curry gravy. Fish, shrimp, and cuttlefish are cooked in similar fashion. Most of Minangkabau food is eaten with hot steamed rice or compressed rice such as &quot;katupek&quot; (ketupat). Vegetables are mostly boiled such as boiled cassava leaf, or simmered in thin curry as side dishes, such as gulai of young jackfruit or cabbages.

In Padang food establishments, it is common to eat with one&#x27;s hands. They usually provide &quot;kabasuah&quot;, a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent. This water is used to wash one&#x27;s hands before and after eating. If a customer does not wish to eat with bare hands, it is acceptable to ask for a spoon and fork.

The cuisine is usually cooked once per day. To have &quot;Nasi Padang&quot; in restaurants customers choose from those dishes, which are left on display in high-stacked plates in the windows. During a dine-in &quot;hidang&quot; (serve) style Padang restaurant, after the customers are seated, they do not have to order. The waiter immediately serves the dishes directly to the table, and the table will quickly be set with dozens of small dishes filled with highly flavored foods such as beef rendang, curried fish, stewed greens, chili eggplant, curried beef liver, tripe, intestines, or foot tendons, fried beef lung, fried chicken, and of course, sambal, the spicy sauces ubiquitous at Indonesian tables. Customers take—and pay for—only what they want from this array. The best known Padang dish is rendang, a spicy meat stew. &quot;Soto Padang&quot; (crispy beef in spicy soup) is local residents&#x27; breakfast favorite, meanwhile &quot;sate&quot; (beef satay in curry sauce served with ketupat) is a treat in the evening.

The serving style is different in &quot;Nasi Kapau&quot; food stalls, a Minangkabau Bukittinggi style. After the customer is seated, he or she is asked which dishes they desire. The chosen dishes will be put directly upon the steamed rice or in separate small plates.

There are myriad Padang food establishments throughout Indonesia and the region, according to &quot;Ikatan Warung Padang Indonesia&quot; (Iwapin) or Warung Padang Bonds. In Greater Jakarta alone there are at least 20,000 Padang restaurant establishments. Several notable Minangkabau restaurant chains are Sederhana, Garuda, Pagi Sore, Simpang Raya, Sari Ratu, Sari Minang, Payakumbuah and Natrabu.

The importance of Padang food establishments (&quot;warung&quot; or &quot;rumah makan&quot; Padang) for Indonesian workers&#x27; lunch break in urban areas, was demonstrated in 2016; when Jakarta municipal civil servants demanded the raise of &quot;uang lauk pauk&quot; (food allowance, as a component of civil servant&#x27;s salary), following the raise of &quot;Nasi Padang&quot; price in Greater Jakarta area.
