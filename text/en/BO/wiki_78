<text>Nimrud (; ) is an ancient Assyrian city (original Assyrian name Kalḫu, biblical name Calah) located in Iraq, south of the city of Mosul, and south of the village of Selamiyah (), in the Nineveh Plains in Upper Mesopotamia. It was a major Assyrian city between approximately 1350 BC and 610 BC. The city is located in a strategic position north of the point that the river Tigris meets its tributary the Great Zab. The city covered an area of . The ruins of the city were found within of the modern-day Assyrian village of Noomanea in Nineveh Governorate, Iraq.

The name Nimrud was recorded as the local name by Carsten Niebuhr in the mid-18th century. In the mid 19th century, biblical archaeologists proposed the Assyrian name Kalḫu (the Biblical &quot;Calah&quot;), based on a description of the travels of Nimrod in Genesis 10.

Archaeological excavations at the site began in 1845, and were conducted at intervals between then and 1879, and then from 1949 onwards. Many important pieces were discovered, with most being moved to museums in Iraq and abroad. In 2013, the UK&#x27;s Arts and Humanities Research Council funded the &quot;Nimrud Project&quot;, directed by Eleanor Robson, whose aims were to write the history of the city in ancient and modern times, to identify and record the dispersal history of artefacts from Nimrud, distributed amongst at least 76 museums worldwide (including 36 in the United States and 13 in the United Kingdom).

In 2015, the terrorist organization Islamic State announced its intention to destroy the site because of its &quot;un-Islamic&quot; Assyrian nature. In March 2015, the Iraqi government reported that Islamic State had used bulldozers to destroy excavated remains of the city. Several videos released by ISIL showed the work in progress. In November 2016, Iraqi forces retook the site, and later visitors also confirmed that around 90% of the excavated portion of city had been completely destroyed. The ruins of Nimrud have remained guarded by Iraqi forces ever since. Reconstruction work is in progress.

== Early history==
===Foundation===
Kalhu was located on a prosperous route and was built of an earlier business community under Shalmaneser I (1274-1245 BCE). Through the centuries, it was in disrepair.

===Capital of the Empire===
The city was established from a previous settlement during the rule of Shalmaneser I (1274-1245 BCE). Ashurnasirpal II ordered the removal of debris from the towers and walls and wanted the construction of a new city. This new city would have a new royal mansion of superior size, bigger than previous monarchs&#x27;.

The kings of Assyria continued to be buried in Assur, but their queens were buried in Kalhu. 
Kalhu is known today as Nimrud because the archaeologists of the 19th and 20th centuries gave it that name, believing it was the legendary city of the biblical Nimrod, which is mentioned in the Book of Genesis.

A grand opening ceremony with festivities and an opulent banquet in 864 BC is described in an inscribed stele discovered during archeological excavations. By 800 BC Nimrud had grown to 75,000 inhabitants making it the largest city in the world.

King Ashurnasirpal&#x27;s son Shalmaneser III (858–823 BC) continued where his father had left off. At Nimrud he built a palace that far surpassed his father&#x27;s. It was twice the size and it covered an area of about and included more than 200 rooms. He built the monument known as the Great Ziggurat, and an associated temple.

Nimrud remained the capital of the Assyrian Empire during the reigns of Shamshi-Adad V (822–811 BC), Adad-nirari III (810–782 BC), Queen Semiramis (810–806 BC), Adad-nirari III (806–782 BC), Shalmaneser IV (782–773 BC), Ashur-dan III (772–755 BC), Ashur-nirari V (754–746 BC), Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC) and Shalmaneser V (726–723 BC). Tiglath-Pileser III in particular, conducted major building works in the city, as well as introducing Eastern Aramaic as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the empire, whose dialects still endure among the Christian Assyrians of the region today.

However, in 706 BC Sargon II (722–705 BC) moved the capital of the empire to Dur Sharrukin, and after his death, Sennacherib (705–681 BC) moved it to Nineveh. It remained a major city and a royal residence until the city was largely destroyed during the fall of the Assyrian Empire at the hands of an alliance of former subject peoples, including the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Scythians, and Cimmerians (between 616 BC and 599 BC).

===Later geographical writings===
Ruins of a similarly located Assyrian city named &quot;Larissa&quot; were described by Xenophon in his &quot;Anabasis&quot; in the 5th century BC.

A similar locality was described in the Middle Ages by a number of Arabic geographers including Yaqut al-Hamawi, Abu&#x27;l-Fida and Ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Maghribi, using the name &quot;Athur&quot; (meaning Assyria) near Selamiyah.

==Archaeology==
===Early writings and debate over name===
====Nimrud====
The name Nimrud in connection with the site in Western writings was first used in the travelogue of Carsten Niebuhr, who was in Mosul in March 1760. Niebuhr 
In 1830, traveller James Silk Buckingham wrote of &quot;two heaps called Nimrod-Tuppé and Shah-Tuppé... The Nimrod-Tuppé has a tradition attached to it, of a palace having been built there by Nimrod&quot;.

However, the name became the cause of significant debate amongst Assyriologists in the mid-nineteenth century, with much of the discussion focusing on the identification of four Biblical cities mentioned in Genesis 10: &quot;From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, the city Rehoboth-Ir, Calah and Resen&quot;.

====Larissa / Resen====
The site was described in more detail by the British traveler Claudius James Rich in 1820, shortly before his death. Rich identified the site with the city of Larissa in Xenophon, and noted that the locals &quot;generally believe this to have been Nimrod&#x27;s own city; and one or two of the better informed with whom I conversed at Mousul said it was Al Athur or Ashur, from which the whole country was denominated.&quot;

The site of Nimrud was visited by William Francis Ainsworth in 1837. Ainsworth, like Rich, identified the site with Larissa (Λάρισσα) of Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot;, concluding that Nimrud was the Biblical Resen on the basis of Bochart&#x27;s identification of Larissa with Resen on etymological grounds.

====Rehoboth====
The site was subsequently visited by James Phillips Fletcher in 1843. Fletcher instead identified the site with Rehoboth on the basis that the city of Birtha described by Ptolemy and Ammianus Marcellinus has the same etymological meaning as Rehoboth in Hebrew.

====Ashur====
Sir Henry Rawlinson mentioned that the Arabic geographers referred to it as Athur. British traveler Claudius James Rich mentions, &quot;one or two of the better informed with whom I conversed at Mosul said it was Al Athur or Ashur, from which the whole country was denominated.&quot;

====Nineveh====
Prior to 1850, Layard believed that the site of &quot;Nimroud&quot; was part of the wider region of &quot;Nineveh&quot; (the debate as to which excavation site represented the city of Nineveh had yet to be resolved), which also included the two mounds today identified as Nineveh-proper, and his excavation publications were thus labeled.

====Calah====
Henry Rawlinson identified the city with the Biblical Calah on the basis of a cuneiform reading of &quot;Levekh&quot; which he connected to the city following Ainsworth and Rich&#x27;s connection of Xenophon&#x27;s Larissa to the site.

===Excavations===

Initial excavations at Nimrud were conducted by Austen Henry Layard, working from 1845 to 1847 and from 1849 until 1851. Following Layard&#x27;s departure, the work was handed over to Hormuzd Rassam in 1853-54 and then William Loftus in 1854–55.

After George Smith briefly worked the site in 1873 and Rassam returned there from 1877 to 1879, Nimrud was left untouched for almost 60 years.

A British School of Archaeology in Iraq team led by Max Mallowan resumed digging at Nimrud in 1949; these excavations resulted in the discovery of the 244 Nimrud Letters. The work continued until 1963 with David Oates becoming director in 1958 followed by Julian Orchard in 1963.

Subsequent work was by the Directorate of Antiquities of the Republic of Iraq (1956, 1959–60, 1969–78 and 1982–92), the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw directed by Janusz Meuszyński (1974–76), Paolo Fiorina (1987–89) with the Centro Ricerche Archeologiche e Scavi di Torino who concentrated mainly on Fort Shalmaneser, and John Curtis (1989). In 1974 to his untimely death in 1976 Janusz Meuszyński, the director of the Polish project, with the permission of the Iraqi excavation team, had the whole site documented on film—in slide film and black-and-white print film. Every relief that remained in situ, as well as the fallen, broken pieces that were distributed in the rooms across the site were photographed. Meuszyński also arranged with the architect of his project, Richard P. Sobolewski, to survey the site and record it in plan and in elevation. As a result, the entire relief compositions were reconstructed, taking into account the presumed location of the fragments that were scattered around the world.

Excavations revealed remarkable bas-reliefs, ivories, and sculptures. A statue of Ashurnasirpal II was found in an excellent state of preservation, as were colossal winged man-headed lions weighing to each guarding the palace entrance. The large number of inscriptions dealing with king Ashurnasirpal II provide more details about him and his reign than are known for any other ruler of this epoch. The palaces of Ashurnasirpal II, Shalmaneser III, and Tiglath-Pileser III have been located. Portions of the site have been also been identified as temples to Ninurta and Enlil, a building assigned to Nabu, the god of writing and the arts, and as extensive fortifications.
In 1988, the Iraqi Department of Antiquities discovered four queens&#x27; tombs at the site.

===Artworks===
Nimrud has been one of the main sources of Assyrian sculpture, including the famous palace reliefs. Layard discovered more than half a dozen pairs of colossal guardian figures guarding palace entrances and doorways. These are &quot;lamassu&quot;, statues with a male human head, the body of a lion or bull, and wings. They have heads carved in the round, but the body at the side is in relief. They weigh up to . In 1847 Layard brought two of the colossi weighing each including one lion and one bull to London. After 18 months and several near disasters he succeeded in bringing them to the British Museum. This involved loading them onto a wheeled cart. They were lowered with a complex system of pulleys and levers operated by dozens of men. The cart was towed by 300 men. He initially tried to hook up the cart to a team of buffalo and have them haul it. However the buffalo refused to move. Then they were loaded onto a barge which required 600 goatskins and sheepskins to keep it afloat. After arriving in London a ramp was built to haul them up the steps and into the museum on rollers.

Additional colossi were transported to Paris from Khorsabad by Paul Emile Botta in 1853. In 1928 Edward Chiera also transported a colossus from Khorsabad to Chicago. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has another pair.
The Statue of Ashurnasirpal II, Stela of Shamshi-Adad V and Stela of Ashurnasirpal II are large sculptures with portraits of these monarchs, all secured for the British Museum by Layard and the British archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam. Also in the British Museum is the famous Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, discovered by Layard in 1846. This stands six-and-a-half-feet tall and commemorates with inscriptions and 24 relief panels the king&#x27;s victorious campaigns of 859–824 BC. It is shaped like a temple tower at the top, ending in three steps.

Series of the distinctive Assyrian shallow reliefs were removed from the palaces and sections are now found in several museums (see gallery below), in particular the British Museum. These show scenes of hunting, warfare, ritual and processions. The Nimrud Ivories are a large group of ivory carvings, probably mostly originally decorating furniture and other objects, that had been brought to Nimrud from several parts of the ancient Near East, and were in a palace storeroom and other locations. These are mainly in the British Museum and the National Museum of Iraq, as well as other museums. Another storeroom held the Nimrud Bowls, about 120 large bronze bowls or plates, also imported.

The &quot;Treasure of Nimrud&quot; unearthed in these excavations is a collection of 613 pieces of gold jewelry and precious stones. It has survived the confusions and looting after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 in a bank vault, where it had been put away for 12 years and was &quot;rediscovered&quot; on June 5, 2003.

===Significant inscriptions===
One panel of the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III has an inscription which includes the name &quot;mIa-ú-a mar mHu-um-ri-i&quot; While Rawlinson originally translated this in 1850 as &quot;Yahua, son of Hubiri&quot;, a year later Reverend Edward Hincks, suggested that it refers to King Jehu of Israel (2 Kings 9:2 ff. While other interpretations exist, the obelisk is widely viewed by biblical archaeologists as therefore including the earliest known dedication of an Israelite. Note: all the kings of Israel were called &quot;sons of Omri&quot; by the Assyrians (&quot;mar&quot; means &quot;son&quot;).

A number of other artifacts considered important to Biblical history were excavated from the site, such as the Nimrud Tablet K.3751 and the Nimrud Slab. The bilingual Assyrian lion weights were important to scholarly deduction of the history of the alphabet.

==Destruction==
Nimrud&#x27;s various monuments had faced threats from exposure to the harsh elements of the Iraqi climate. Lack of proper protective roofing meant that the ancient reliefs at the site were susceptible to erosion from wind-blown sand and strong seasonal rains.

In mid-2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) occupied the area surrounding Nimrud. ISIL destroyed other holy sites, including the Mosque of the Prophet Jonah in Mosul. In early 2015, they announced their intention to destroy many ancient artifacts, which they deemed idolatrous or otherwise un-Islamic; they subsequently destroyed thousands of books and manuscripts in Mosul&#x27;s libraries. In February 2015, ISIL destroyed Akkadian monuments in the Mosul Museum, and on March 5, 2015, Iraq announced that ISIL militants had bulldozed Nimrud and its archaeological site on the basis that they were blasphemous.

A member of ISIL filmed the destruction, declaring, &quot;These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The Prophet Muhammad took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries.&quot; ISIL declared an intention to destroy the restored city gates in Nineveh. ISIL went on to do demolition work at the later Parthian ruined city of Hatra. On April 12 2015, an online militant video purportedly showed ISIL militants hammering, bulldozing, and ultimately using explosives to blow up parts of Nimrud.

Irina Bokova, the director general of UNESCO, stated &quot;deliberate destruction of cultural heritage constitutes a war crime&quot;. The president of the Syriac League in Lebanon compared the losses at the site to the destruction of culture by the Mongol Empire. In November 2016, aerial photographs showed the systematic leveling of the Ziggurat by heavy machines. On 13 November 2016, the Iraqi Army recaptured the city from ISIL. The Joint Operations Command stated that it had raised the Iraqi flag above its buildings and also captured the Assyrian village of Numaniya, on the edge of the town. By the time Nimrud was retaken, around 90% of the excavated part of the city had been destroyed entirely. Every major structure had been damaged, the Ziggurat of Nimrud had been flattened, only a few scattered broken walls remained of the palace of Ashurnasirpal II, the Lamassu that once guarded its gates had been smashed and scattered across the landscape.

=== Reconstruction of the site ===
A renovation program started in July 2017 with the support of UNESCO. The first phase included conducting studies of the damage caused to the site, assembling an Iraqi maintenance and rehabilitation team, preservation and archiving of the city&#x27;s cultural heritage in co-operation with the American Smithsonian Institution. Phase 2 was launched in October 2019 with the goal to restore the northern palace.

As of 2020, archaeologists from the Nimrud Rescue Project have carried out two seasons of work at the site, training native Iraqi archaeologists on protecting heritage and helping preserve the remains. Plans for reconstruction and tourism are in the works but will likely not be implemented within the next decade. The first major excavation works, launched in mid-October 2022 by an excavation team from the University of Pennsylvania, reported the discovery of a door sill slab with inscriptions in December.

===Security post Islamic State===
Following the liberation from Islamic State, the security of the ancient city is run by the ethnic Assyrian security force Nineveh Plain Protection Units.

<text>Overeating occurs when an individual consumes more calories in relation to the energy that is expended via physical activity or expelled via excretion, leading to weight gain and often obesity. Overeating is the defining characteristic of binge eating disorder.

Overeating can be a symptom of binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa.

In a broader sense, hyperalimentation includes excessive food administration through other means than eating, e.g. through parenteral nutrition.

==Treatment==
Cognitive behavioural therapy, individual therapy, and group therapy are often beneficial in helping people keep track of their eating habits and changing the way they cope with difficult situations. Often overeating and the related binge eating are related to dieting, body image issues, as well as social pressures.

There are several 12-step programs that helps overeaters, such as Overeaters Anonymous or Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous and others. 
It is quite clear through research, and various studies that overeating causes addictive behaviors.

In some instances, overeating has been linked to the use of medications known as dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole.

<text>In fluid mechanics, or more generally continuum mechanics, incompressible flow (isochoric flow) refers to a flow in which the material density of each fluid parcel — an infinitesimal volume that moves with the flow velocity — is time-invariant. An equivalent statement that implies incompressible flow is that the divergence of the flow velocity is zero (see the derivation below, which illustrates why these conditions are equivalent).

Incompressible flow does not imply that the fluid itself is incompressible. It is shown in the derivation below that under the right conditions even the flow of compressible fluids can, to a good approximation, be modelled as incompressible flow.

==Derivation==

The fundamental requirement for incompressible flow is that the density, formula_1, is constant within a small element volume, &quot;dV&quot;, which moves at the flow velocity u. Mathematically, this constraint implies that the material derivative (discussed below) of the density must vanish to ensure incompressible flow. Before introducing this constraint, we must apply the conservation of mass to generate the necessary relations. The mass is calculated by a volume integral of the density, formula_1:

:formula_3

The conservation of mass requires that the time derivative of the mass inside a control volume be equal to the mass flux, J, across its boundaries. Mathematically, we can represent this constraint in terms of a surface integral:

The negative sign in the above expression ensures that outward flow results in a decrease in the mass with respect to time, using the convention that the surface area vector points outward. Now, using the divergence theorem we can derive the relationship between the flux and the partial time derivative of the density:

:formula_4

therefore:

:formula_5

The partial derivative of the density with respect to time need not vanish to ensure incompressible &quot;flow&quot;. When we speak of the partial derivative of the density with respect to time, we refer to this rate of change within a control volume of &quot;fixed position&quot;. By letting the partial time derivative of the density be non-zero, we are not restricting ourselves to incompressible &quot;fluids&quot;, because the density can change as observed from a fixed position as fluid flows through the control volume. This approach maintains generality, and not requiring that the partial time derivative of the density vanish illustrates that compressible fluids can still undergo incompressible flow. What interests us is the change in density of a control volume that moves along with the flow velocity, u. The flux is related to the flow velocity through the following function:

:formula_6

So that the conservation of mass implies that:

:formula_7

The previous relation (where we have used the appropriate product rule) is known as the continuity equation. Now, we need the following relation about the total derivative of the density (where we apply the chain rule):

:formula_8

So if we choose a control volume that is moving at the same rate as the fluid (i.e. (&quot;dx&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;, &quot;dy&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;, &quot;dz&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;) = u), then this expression simplifies to the material derivative:

:formula_9

And so using the continuity equation derived above, we see that:

:formula_10

A change in the density over time would imply that the fluid had either compressed or expanded (or that the mass contained in our constant volume, &quot;dV&quot;, had changed), which we have prohibited. We must then require that the material derivative of the density vanishes, and equivalently (for non-zero density) so must the divergence of the flow velocity:

:formula_11

And so beginning with the conservation of mass and the constraint that the density within a moving volume of fluid remains constant, it has been shown that an equivalent condition required for incompressible flow is that the divergence of the flow velocity vanishes.

==Relation to compressibility==

In some fields, a measure of the incompressibility of a flow is the change in density as a result of the pressure variations. This is best expressed in terms of the compressibility

:formula_12

If the compressibility is acceptably small, the flow is considered incompressible.

==Relation to solenoidal field==
An incompressible flow is described by a solenoidal flow velocity field. But a solenoidal field, besides having a zero divergence, also has the additional connotation of having non-zero curl (i.e., rotational component).

Otherwise, if an incompressible flow also has a curl of zero, so that it is also irrotational, then the flow velocity field is actually Laplacian.

== Difference from material ==
As defined earlier, an incompressible (isochoric) flow is the one in which 
:formula_13
This is equivalent to saying that
:formula_14
i.e. the material derivative of the density is zero. Thus if one follows a material element, its mass density remains constant. Note that the material derivative consists of two terms. The first term formula_15 describes how the density of the material element changes with time. This term is also known as the &quot;unsteady term&quot;. The second term, formula_16 describes the changes in the density as the material element moves from one point to another. This is the &quot;advection term&quot; (convection term for scalar field). For a flow to be accounted as bearing incompressibility, the accretion sum of these terms should vanish.

On the other hand, a homogeneous, incompressible material is one that has constant density throughout. For such a material, formula_17. This implies that, 
:formula_18 and
:formula_19 &quot;independently&quot;.

From the continuity equation it follows that 
:formula_20

Thus homogeneous materials always undergo flow that is incompressible, but the converse is not true. That is, compressible materials might not experience compression in the flow.

== Related flow constraints ==

In fluid dynamics, a flow is considered incompressible if the divergence of the flow velocity is zero. However, related formulations can sometimes be used, depending on the flow system being modelled. Some versions are described below:

# &quot;Incompressible flow&quot;: formula_21. This can assume either constant density (strict incompressible) or varying density flow. The varying density set accepts solutions involving small perturbations in density, pressure and/or temperature fields, and can allow for pressure stratification in the domain.
# &quot;Anelastic flow&quot;: formula_22. Principally used in the field of atmospheric sciences, the anelastic constraint extends incompressible flow validity to stratified density and/or temperature as well as pressure. This allows the thermodynamic variables to relax to an &#x27;atmospheric&#x27; base state seen in the lower atmosphere when used in the field of meteorology, for example. This condition can also be used for various astrophysical systems.
# &quot;Low Mach-number flow&quot;, or &quot;pseudo-incompressibility&quot;: formula_23. The low Mach-number constraint can be derived from the compressible Euler equations using scale analysis of non-dimensional quantities. The restraint, like the previous in this section, allows for the removal of acoustic waves, but also allows for &quot;large&quot; perturbations in density and/or temperature. The assumption is that the flow remains within a Mach number limit (normally less than 0.3) for any solution using such a constraint to be valid. Again, in accordance with all incompressible flows the pressure deviation must be small in comparison to the pressure base state.

These methods make differing assumptions about the flow, but all take into account the general form of the constraint formula_23 for general flow dependent functions formula_25 and formula_26.

==Numerical approximations==

The stringent nature of incompressible flow equations means that specific mathematical techniques have been devised to solve them. Some of these methods include:
# The projection method (both approximate and exact)
# Artificial compressibility technique (approximate)
# Compressibility pre-conditioning

<text>The Bisnovat 5 (Бисноват 5) was a supersonic research aircraft designed in the USSR in the late 1940s, inspired by the German DFS 346 aircraft that was captured by Soviet troops towards the end of World War II.

The aircraft was ordered into development to provide an all-Soviet alternative to an aircraft built with foreign technology. Originally intended to take-off from the ground, gliding flights were carried out from a Petlyakov Pe-8 mothership, similar to the way that the Bell X-1 was dropped from a B-29 Superfortress mothership.

Unpowered flight tests revealed poor stability and dangerous landing characteristics with Aircraft 5-1 (first prototype) being damaged beyond repair after the third gliding flight. Flight tests with Aircraft 5-2, fitted with a 45 degree swept fin of greater aspect ratio to improve directional stability, resumed on 26 January 1949. However, further delays were caused by the pilot landing off the runway causing serious damage. 

To improve the landing stability the 5-2 was modified with wing-tip skids, at the end of downturned wing-tips with 45 degrees anhedral, and a single skid on the centreline, as well as a ventral fin at the rear. Flying and landing qualities were much improved, but progress was slow and the Bisnovat 5 was cancelled without the aircraft making a single powered flight and only sixteen gliding flights, between 14 July 1948 and November 1949, during which a maximum speed of Mach 0.775 was attained.

<text>HMS &quot;Battler&quot; (D18) was an American-built escort carrier that served with the Royal Navy during the Second World War.

Converted from a merchantman under construction, she was acquired by the United States Navy on 31 October 1942, as a ; she was transferred to the Royal Navy and commissioned &quot;Battler&quot; on the same day under the Lend-Lease agreement.

&quot;Battler&quot;″s first duty was as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. The ship was active in the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and later, the war in the Pacific. She served as a convoy escort, aircraft ferry, and anti-submarine escort during the war.

==Construction==
She was laid down on 15 April 1941, as a C3-S-A1, the third replacement for the freighter &quot;Mormacmail&quot;, for Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., under Maritime Commission contract at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Ingalls Shipbuilding, MC Hull 160. She was purchased by the United States Navy on 7 January 1942, for conversion to a and renamed &quot;Altamaha&quot;. On 17 March 1942, her name was cancelled and she was assigned to be transferred to the Royal Navy under Lend-Lease. She was launched on 4 April 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Marguerite M. Seymour, the wife of Captain Phillip Seymour, USN. She was redesignated ACV on 20 August 1942. Acquired by the United States Navy on 31 October 1942, she was immediately transferred to the United Kingdom on the same day. She was renamed HMS &quot;Battler&quot; (D18) and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 November 1942, as an .

==Design and description==
There were eleven &quot;Attacker&quot;-class in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were built between 1941 and 1942, by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Ingalls Shipbuilding, and Western Pipe &amp; Steel shipyards in the United States.

The ship had complement of 646 men, who lived in crew accommodation that was significantly different from the arrangements that were normal for the Royal Navy at the time. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three-tier bunk-beds, 18 to a cabin, which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.

&quot;Battler&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at full load. Power was provided by two boilers feeding steam to a turbine driving one shaft, giving , which could propel the ship at .

She had the operating capacity for up to 24 aircraft, which could be a mixture of anti-submarine and fighter aircraft; the British Hawker Sea Hurricane and Supermarine Seafire naval fighters, Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber or the American-supplied Grumman Martlet and Vought F4U Corsair fighters or Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber could be carried. The exact composition of the embarked squadrons depended upon the mission. Some squadrons were composite squadrons for convoy defence and would be equipped with both anti-submarine and fighter aircraft, while other squadrons working in a strike carrier role would only be equipped with fighter aircraft. Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the flight deck, two aircraft lifts , and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. When employed as an aircraft transport she could carry 90 aircraft.
The ships armament concentrated on anti-aircraft (AA) defence and consisted of eight Bofors guns in twin mounts and ten Oerlikon cannons in single and eight in twin mounts. In addition, she had two /50 caliber Mk 9 guns for surface action.

&quot;Battler&quot; was designed to accompany other ships forming the escort for convoys. The anti-submarine aircraft employed were initially the Fairey Swordfish and later the Grumman Avenger, which could be armed with torpedoes, depth charges, bombs or RP-3 rocket projectiles. As well as carrying out their own attacks on U-Boats, these aircraft identified their locations for the convoy&#x27;s escorts to mount an attack. Typically anti-submarine patrols would be flown between dawn and dusk. One aircraft would fly about ahead of the convoy, while another patrolled astern. Patrols would last between two and three hours, using both radar and visual observation in their search for U-Boats.
&quot;Battler&quot; also had a secondary role, providing oil and provisions for her accompanying destroyers. This could be a lengthy process and was done on the move. It took 40 minutes from firing a line across to the destroyer to start pumping oil, while it took another two hours to pump 98 tons of oil and a further 35 minutes to disconnect the hose pipe and secure the equipment.

==Service history==
&quot;Battler&quot; began her sea trials in early November 1942, but had to put in at New Orleans, 9 November, for repairs after striking a jetty. With repairs finished by 15 November, she returned to trials until 23 November, when she arrived at Norfolk Navy Yard, in Virginia. Here defects found during her trials were rectified and modification work carried out.

Beginning 8 December 1942, &quot;Battler&quot; embarked the Naval Air Squadrons 890, 892, and 894 consisting of six Martlet IVs each. On 11 December, she sailed for the east coast of Florida, to embark six Swordfish of 840 squadron on 12 December. &quot;Battler&quot; arrived in New York City, on 18 December, and proceeded to Todd Erie Basin Dry Docks, Inc. to clean out her fuel tanks.

On 21 December 1942, &quot;Battler&quot; sailed for Liverpool, with Convoy HX 220. On 26 December, 840 squadron disembarked for NAS Quonset Point, for further work-up. After a stormy crossing &quot;Battler&quot; arrived on the Clyde on 8 January 1943, where 890, 892 and 894 squadrons disembarked to RNAS Machrihanish, then she proceeded to Harland and Wolff, for refit to Royal Navy standards, arriving 12 January.
After completing her refit, &quot;Battler&quot; sailed for Greenock, on 4 April, for trials. The ship&#x27;s air group was brought on board on 10 April 1943, and consisted of six Swordfish II biplanes, former torpedo planes given a new lease on life as an antisubmarine aircraft, of the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s 835 squadron and nine Seafires of 808 squadron.

&quot;Battler&quot; embarked 20 Seafires and 2 Hurricane IICs at RNAMY Belfast, on 23 May, for ferrying to Gibraltar. Departing Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 4 June 1943, she took on five Swordfish from 835 squadron, on 5 June, along with four Seafires from 808 squadron from RNAS Yeovilton, the next day. She joined the destroyers and on June 6, with orders to overtake Convoy OS 49, which had sailed from Liverpool, for Gibraltar, on 4 June, to provide air cover. Throughout the voyage, her aircraft conducted antisubmarine patrols, reaching Gibraltar, on 14 June. She returned to the British Isles eight days later, as part of the escort for Convoy KMS 16 and XK 9. &quot;Battler&quot; launched two Seafires at 2230 on 24 June, to deal with a four engined Focke Wulf FW 200 &quot;Condor&quot; which was shadowing the convoy. Within 12 minutes, the pilots reported triumphantly that the &quot;Condor&quot; had been shot down. Reaching Greenock, on 28 June, &quot;Battler&quot; had proved herself efficient on her maiden convoy escort venture.

===Mediterranean===
====Operation Avalanche====
&quot;Battler&quot; set sail for Gibraltar, and the Mediterranean theatre, on 2 August, along with her sister ships , , and , from Clyde. She was to provide air cover for Operation Avalanche, the invasion of Salerno, Italy.

On 1 September 1943, &quot;Battler&quot; became part of &quot;Task Force 88&quot;, consisting of the escort carriers &quot;Attacker&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Stalker&quot;, the aircraft repair ship , the cruisers , , , the destroyers , , , , , , and the Polish destroyers and . &quot;Battler&quot; arrived at Malta, 5 September, and sailed for Salerno, on 8 September. The carriers were to provide air cover during the landings, with up to 20 aircraft in flight at a time. It had been planned that at least one of the enemy airfields would be taken on the first day of the invasion, but it took until the third day for this to happen. Since the escort carriers were designed for anti-submarine warfare (A/S), none of them were equipped for fighter direction, this was provided by the Fighter Direction Ship .

On 12 September, the task force withdrew to Palermo, Sicily, for replenishment, returning 16 September. On 20 September, &quot;Attacker&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, and &quot;Stalker&quot; returned to the United Kingdom for refit and replacement aircraft, while &quot;Battler&quot; proceeded to Gibraltar. She was assigned to the Eastern Fleet for duty protecting Bombay to Aden convoys.

===Indian Ocean===

On 22 September 1943, &quot;Battler&quot; embarked 834 squadron and joined , , , and the Greek destroyers , , and escorting Convoy KMF 24 enroute to Port Said. On 28 September, she arrived in Port Said, and after passing through the Suez Canal, sailed for Aden, arriving 4 October 1943.

On 17 October, after having her boilers cleaned at Aden, &quot;Battler&quot; joined Convoy AB 17, along with , , and for escort to Bombay. She arrived on 26 October, and left 4 November, along with &quot;Quiberon&quot; and &quot;Quality&quot; to rendezvous with the LST Convoy AB 18A for escort to Bombay. She provided A/S cover from 7 to 9 November. On 11 November, &quot;Battler&quot;, , &quot;Rotherham&quot;, and left Bombay to rendezvous with Convoy AB 20 for escort to Bombay. She again provided A/S coverage from 14 to 17 November.

On 12 December, she set out with &quot;Rotherham&quot;, &quot;Nepal&quot;, and to meet Convoy AB 24 on 15 December. &quot;Battler&quot; and part of the convoy, after having split into three sections, arrived in Bombay, on 19 December. She finished off her Indian Ocean escorts with Convoy AB 27A, leaving Bombay on 26 December, with &quot;Rotherham&quot;, , , , and to rendezvous on 11 January, for escort back to Bombay.

====Operations Thwart and Covered====
&quot;Battler&quot; joined the cruisers , , and , the armed merchant cruiser , the destroyer &quot;Nepal&quot;, and the frigate to form Force 62 for Operation Thwart. The purpose of the operation was to search for the blockade runner, U-boat supply ship &quot;Charlotte Schliemann&quot;, southeast of Mauritius. With the main force sailing from Colombo on 12 January, &quot;Battler&quot; joined them at Mauritius on 16 January. The force searched from 19 to 21 January, then a smaller force, named Force 64, consisting of &quot;Battler&quot;, &quot;Kenya&quot;, and &quot;Nepal&quot;, searching from 23 to 30 January, further southeast of Mauritius. The operation was called off on 30 January, after adverse weather set in and fruitless searching turned up nothing.

On 4 February, &quot;Battler&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; arrived at Durban, South Africa. She returned to Mauritius, in early March, to search for another blockade runner, the U-boat supply ship &quot;Brake&quot;, during Operation Covered. On 12 March, after seven days of searching, a Swordfish of 834 squadron, spotted the tanker &quot;Brake&quot; with two or three U-boats alongside her, southeast of Mauritius. &quot;Battler&quot; launched Swordfish armed with rockets to shadow &quot;Brake&quot; in an attempt not to alert the tanker to the carriers presence, while &quot;Roebuck&quot; moved in for an attack. At noon, &quot;Roebuck&quot; commenced her attack on &quot;Brake&quot; forcing her crew to scuttle her, while the Swordfish damaged one of the U-boats. On 16 March, the group arrived in Mauritius, with &quot;Battler&quot; proceeding to Durban, for refit, arriving 21 March 1944.

====Convoy and A/S duty====
Embarking only the Swordfish of 834 squadron on 24 June 1944, after completion of her refit, &quot;Battler&quot; sailed north with Convoy CM 55, from Durban to Kilindini, on 28 June. She escorted Convoy KR 11 from Kilindini to Colombo, on 11 July, arriving on 22 July. She disembarked 834 squadron at RNAS Katukurunda on 25 July, where six Wildcat Vs were waiting to replace the Seafires that had been left at Durban.

On August 11, 1944, 834 squadron embarked on &quot;Battler&quot; and carried out A/S patrols near Colombo. On 22 August, she set off for Addu Atoll, in the Maldive Islands, to carry out more A/S patrols. On 19 September, 834 squadron disembarked at RNAS Coimbatore, for replacement aircraft, returning to &quot;Battler&quot; on 28 September. On 7 October, &quot;Battler&quot; disembarked 834 squadron at Trincomalee. During her time at Trincomalee, 849 squadrons Avengers performed Deck Landing Training.

====Ferry duty====
&quot;Battler&quot; was redesignated as a &quot;Ferry Carrier&quot; at the beginning of November. On 7 November 1944, she embarked 834 squadron to be ferried back to the UK. She meet up with and the two ships arrived at Adabiya, on 21 November. With her orders changed, &quot;Battler&quot; unloaded 834 squadron while &quot;Thane&quot; unloaded the Avenger and Hellcraft aircraft that were to be embarked in &quot;Battler&quot; for transport to Sydney, Australia. She would still return to the UK, but it would be via Australia and the Panama Canal.

After returning to Colombo, to prepare for her ferry run to Sydney, she departed on 9 December 1944, with the carrier , the cruiser , and the destroyers and , for Australia. They were joined on 10 December, by the ships , the flagship of Fourth Cruiser Squadron commander Rear Admiral E.J.P. Brind, and the destroyers , , and . On 11 December, most of the destroyers broke from the convoy and returned to Trincomalee, while &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; departed on 16 December, to continue ahead for Fremantle.

After unloading her aircraft in Sydney, &quot;Battler&quot; loaded stores and equipment bound for the UK. She arrived in Bilbao, on 1 February 1945, and Norfolk, Virginia, on 3 February. Embarking aircraft at Naval Station Norfolk, she sailed for New York on 13 February, to join Convoy CU 59. CU 59 departed New York, on 19 February, and arrived on 1 March, at Liverpool.

===North Atlantic===
====Deck landing training====
On 5 March 1945, &quot;Battler&quot; was allocated to Western Approaches Command for use as a Deck Landing Training carrier. For her new role &quot;Battler&quot; received modification in Belfast. On 5 May 1945, she began practice with 768 squadron in the Firth of Clyde. On 4 June, she was allocated to Rosyth Command in the same role, but shifting to the Firth of Forth with 768 squadron. In October, she began training 731 and 767 squadrons until 8 January 1946, when she was sent to Greenock, for decommissioning.

==Decommissioning==
On 19 January, &quot;Battler&quot; sailed from the Clyde, for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving 31 January. She was decommissioned at Norfolk, on 12 February, and returned to USN custody. Deemed &quot;not essential to the defense of the United States&quot;, on 6 March, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 March. She was sold on 14 May, to the Patapsco Steel Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and delivered on 12 June 1946, and was subsequently scrapped.

==Background==
Lord Halifax is the third child and only son of Charles Wood, 2nd Earl of Halifax, a grandson of Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax, Viceroy of India and Foreign Secretary. His mother, Ruth Wood (née Primrose), Countess of Halifax, was a daughter of Neil Primrose, and a granddaughter of Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby.

He was brought up at Swinford Paddocks, Newmarket, and educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.

==Career==
As Peter Wood, he unsuccessfully contested Dearne Valley as a Conservative candidate at the February general election of 1974 and the October general election of the same year. On 19 March 1980, he succeeded to the titles of 3rd Earl of Halifax, 7th Baronet Wood, of Barnsley in the County of York, 5th Viscount Halifax of Monk Bretton, in the West Riding of the County of Yorkshire, and 3rd Baron Irwin, of Kirby Underdale in the County of York.

Lord Halifax held the office of Deputy Lieutenant (DL) of Humberside between 1983 and 1996. He held the office of Justice of the Peace (JP) for Wilton Beacon in 1985 and the office of High Steward of York Minster in 1988. Wood held the office of Vice-Lord-Lieutenant of the &quot;East Riding, Yorkshire&quot;, in 1996. He is a Knight of St John and JP.

Lord Halifax was a non-executive director of Hambros Bank (1981–1998), the Vice-Chairman of Christie, Manson &amp; Woods (the European Division of Christie&#x27;s international fine arts auctioneers) (resigned as a director 2001), and a director of Yorkshire Post Newspapers Ltd (until 1997).
He serves as a Board Governor for The Pocklington School Foundation.

The Earl and Countess of Halifax are active members of the Jockey Club. They were invited to ride in the King&#x27;s procession at Royal Ascot 2023.

==Family==

In 1976, Lord Halifax (then Lord Irwin) (who had once been minded for a potential husband of Princess Anne) married Camilla Younger, of the Scottish brewing family, former wife of Richard Parker Bowles (married in 1973 and divorced in 1976), a younger brother of Andrew Parker Bowles, first husband of Queen Camilla. Andrew also had a dalliance with Princess Anne. The Countess of Halifax and Queen Camilla are former sisters-in-law.

<text>HMS &quot;Attacker&quot; (D02) was an American-built escort carrier that served with the Royal Navy during the Second World War.

Converted from a merchantman under construction, she was commissioned by the United States Navy on 30 September 1942, as USS &quot;Barnes&quot; (CVE-7), a ; she was decommissioned and transferred to the Royal Navy on the same day under the Lend-Lease agreement.

&quot;Attacker&quot; served throughout the war, first as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. After further conversion by the Royal Navy in October 1943, into an assault carrier, the ship was active in the Mediterranean, and later the war in the Pacific. In late August 1945, &quot;Attacker&quot; witnessed the Japanese surrender of Penang, in Malaya, as part of Operation Jurist.

==Construction==
The merchantman &quot;Steel Artisan&quot; was laid down on 17 April 1941, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 171, by Western Pipe and Steel Company of San Francisco. She was renamed &quot;Barnes&quot; (AVG-7) on 3 September 1941, and launched on 27 September 1941. &quot;Barnes&quot; was towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard on 10 October 1941, for conversion to an escort carrier. On 1 March 1942, she was assigned to be transferred to the British under Lend-Lease. She was redesignated BACV-7 on 20 August 1942. &quot;Barnes&quot; was commissioned into the US Navy on 30 September 1942, and decommissioned and transferred to the Royal Navy on the same day. On 7 October 1942, she was commissioned into the Royal Navy as under the command of Captain Shirley-Rollison, RN.

==Design and description==
&quot;Attacker&quot; was the lead ship in what became the Royal Navy&#x27;s of 11 ships; one of 38 escort carriers built in the United States for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. The Western Pipe &amp; Steel shipyards built three other ships in the class. Once completed she was supplied under the terms of Lend-Lease agreement to the Royal Navy. There was a ships complement of 646 men, who lived in crew accommodation that was significantly different from the arrangements that were normal for the Royal Navy at the time. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three-tier bunk-beds, 18 to a cabin, which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.

&quot;Attacker&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at full load. Power was provided by two boilers feeding steam to a turbine driving one shaft, giving , which could propel the ship at .

She had the capacity for up to 24 aircraft which could be a mixture of anti-submarine and fighter aircraft; the British Hawker Sea Hurricane and Supermarine Seafire naval fighters, Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber or the American-supplied Grumman Martlet and Vought F4U Corsair fighters or Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber could be carried. The exact composition of the embarked squadrons depended upon the mission. Some squadrons were composite squadrons for convoy defence and would be equipped with both anti-submarine and fighter aircraft, while other squadrons working in a strike carrier role would only be equipped with fighter aircraft. Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the flight deck, two aircraft lifts , and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck.
The ships armament concentrated on anti-aircraft (AA) defence and comprised two QF MK V dual purpose guns in single mounts, eight Bofors guns in twin mounts and ten Oerlikon cannons in single and eight in twin mounts.

&quot;Attacker&quot; was designed to accompany other ships forming the escort for convoys. The anti-submarine aircraft employed were initially the Fairey Swordfish and later the Grumman Avenger, which could be armed with torpedoes, depth charges, bombs or RP-3 rocket projectiles. As well as carrying out their own attacks on U-Boats, these aircraft identified their locations for the convoy&#x27;s escorts to mount an attack. Typically anti-submarine patrols would be flown between dawn and dusk. One aircraft would fly about ahead of the convoy, while another patrolled astern. Patrols would last between two and three hours, using both radar and visual observation in their search for U-Boats.
&quot;Attacker&quot; also had a secondary role, providing oil and provisions for her accompanying destroyers. This could be a lengthy process and was done on the move. It took 40 minutes from firing a line across to the destroyer to start pumping oil, while it took another two hours to pump 98 tons of oil and a further 35 minutes to disconnect the hose pipe and secure the equipment.

==Service history==
On 12 November 1942, &quot;Attacker&quot; started her flying and sea trials off San Francisco. She had embarked four Swordfish I torpedo bombers of 838 squadron from Naval Air Station Alameda. After completion of her trials, and being qualified for duty, she set sail for Balboa, on 12 December, with 838 squadron. She passed through the Panama Canal, and arrived at Cristobal, on 22 December. She later sailed for NAS Quonset Point, where she disembarked 838 squadron, 1 January 1943. &quot;Attacker&quot; was in Chesapeake Bay, during January, for a period of Deck Landing Training (DLT) with Martlets from 882 squadron, 896 squadron, and 898 squadron and Swordfish from 838 and 840 squadrons.

On 2 March 1943, &quot;Attacker&quot; set sail for Curacao, with 838 squadron and six Swordfish from 840 squadron, for escort duty with Convoy CU 1. &quot;Attacker&quot;″s first active service in the Atlantic was to provided anti submarine cover during her crossing from the United States to Great Britain. She set sail from Curacao, on 20 March 1943, arriving in Clyde, on 1 April 1943, and Liverpool the following day. On 4 April 1943, in Liverpool, she started two months of modification during which radar was fitted and US guns were changed for British ones. On 2 August, she sailed, along with her sister ships , , and for Gibraltar, with aircraft from 886 (Seafire fighters and Swordfish torpedo bombers) and 879 (Seafires) squadrons on board.

===Mediterranean===
====Operation Avalanche====
&quot;Attacker&quot; transferred to the Mediterranean theatre reaching Malta, 7 September 1943 as part of &quot;Task Force 88&quot;, consisting of the escort carriers &quot;Battler&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Stalker&quot;, the aircraft repair ship , the cruisers , , , the destroyers , , , , , and the Polish destroyers and to providing cover for the Allied amphibious landings on mainland Italy, near Salerno, in Operation Avalanche. From 9 to 12 September, the five carriers launched a total of 713 sorties, with &quot;Attacker&quot; sending out 132. Seventy-five patrol sorties were carried out by 879 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) while 57 were flown by 886 NAS, with no aircraft lost to enemy action. &quot;Attacker&quot; joined Convoy MK 24, along with &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;Stalker&quot;, to escort it from Gibraltar to the Clyde, from 17 September to 6 October 1943. She then sailed for Rosyth Naval Dockyard, on 7 October, for conversion to an assault carrier, arriving 10 October.

====Conversion====

With her upgrades finished in December 1943, &quot;Attacker&quot; again embarked Seafires of 879 and 886 squadrons on 29 December, for training from January to February 1944, in her new role of providing air support for major military landings until shore based air strips became operational. Operation Avalanche had proven a need for this strategy. She returned to Liverpool, on 9 February, for further repairs.

&quot;Attacker&quot;, along with &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;Stalker&quot;, were ordered to Scapa Flow, arriving on 5 May 1944, for participation in Operation Hoops scheduled for 8 May. However, before the operation was launched changes were made and the escort carriers , , and were instead allocated and the three carriers set sail for Belfast, on 7 May, and arrived the next day.

On 14 May, the three ships set out for the Mediterranean as additional escorts for the Convoy KMS 51, which had departed Liverpool, the previous day. &quot;Attacker&quot; detached from the convoy on 19 May, and put into Gibraltar, 24 May. On 2 June, she moved from her berth on the North Mole to the inside of the Detached Mole, where on the night of 4 June, while silhouetted behind the mole, an enemy submarine launched a torpedo at her. The torpedo detonated on the outside of the mole which caused to serious damage to &quot;Attacker&quot;. On June 6, she and &quot;Hunter&quot; sailed for Mers El Kébir, providing air cover for Convoy KMS 52.

====Operation Dragoon====

During June 1944, &quot;Attacker&quot; provided air cover for several convoys travelling in the Western Mediterranean. On 23 July, she sailed for Malta, in company with , , &quot;Searcher&quot; and &quot;Emperor&quot;, anchoring in Dockyard Creek on 25 July, to prepare for Operation Dragoon.

&quot;Attacker&quot; joined Carrier Force TF88.1 for Operation Dragoon. The force exercised off Malta, between 2 and 12 August, with the invasion starting in the early hours of 15 August. On 19 August, TF88.1 withdrew to Maddalena, Sardinia, for refueling and rearming. They took up position south of Marseilles, on 21 August, until 23 August, when they returned to Maddalena, again to refuel and rearm. TF88.1 was released on 28 August. &quot;Attacker&quot; had completed 106 ground strike, bombardment spotting for , tactical reconnaissance missions and 120 bombing sorties. She left Maddalena, for Alexandria, on 29 August.

====Operations Outing I, Outing II, Manna====
&quot;Attacker&quot; set sail on 14 September 1944, to participate in Operation Outing I, an operation designed to delay German troop movements in the Dodecanese Islands. She arrived 15 September, and relieved &quot;Hunter&quot;. She returned to Alexandria, on 20 September, to resupply, and returned to the Dodecanese Islands, on 27 September, for Operation Outing II. She again returned to Alexandria, 5 October, for further refuel and rearm. &quot;Hunter&quot; was again relieved by &quot;Attacker&quot; in the eastern Aegean Sea, on 11 October, for Operation Manna. Returning 30 October, to Alexandria.

&quot;Attacker&quot;, along with &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;Stalker&quot;, set sail for the United Kingdom, on 31 October 1944, having been picked for service with the East Indies Fleet. After a brief stopover at Malta, on 3 November, the three carriers reached Plymouth, 10 November, for a short period of defect rectifications at the Devonport Naval Dockyard and the opportunity for their crews to go on home leave. On 29 November, the three set out for the Mediterranean, to undergo refits in transit to the Pacific. They arrived in Gibraltar, on 3 December, where &quot;Stalker&quot; was refit with &quot;Hunter&quot; proceeding to Malta, and &quot;Attacker&quot; proceeding to Taranto, Italy, their refits.

After completing refit trials &quot;Attacker&quot; set sail on 1 April 1945, for Alexandria. She embarked 879 squadron on 14 April, then proceeded through the Suez Canal, to Aden, and then Ceylon, arriving 29 April.

===Pacific War===
&quot;Attacker&quot; was assigned to 21 ACS, but due to defects discovered during her transit to the Pacific Theater, she was deemed unfit for operation. During May, and part of June, &quot;Attacker&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot; were assigned to aircraft transport duties between India and South Africa to Ceylon.

====Operation Carson====
After a couple of training periods during June and July with 879 NAS she was allocated to Task Force 61 to participate in Operation Carson, attacks on Japanese shipping and airfields in the Penang and Medan areas of Sumatra. She again embarked 879 NAS on 9 August, and sailed from Trincomalee, on 10 August 1945, along with the escort carriers , &quot;Emperor&quot;, , &quot;Khedive&quot;, and with strikes planned to be carried out on 14 and 15 August. Task Force 61 was order to hold west of 90 degrees east latitude on 11 August, to wait for further orders. They were ordered to return to Trincomalee, arriving 15 August, where they received the Station General Message, &quot;SUSPEND OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AGAINST JAPANESE FORCES.&quot; &quot;Attacker&quot; was in harbour at Trincomalee, to celebrate V-J Day while waiting on new orders. She had already been allocated to Operation Zipper, the planned invasion of Singapore, which was scheduled for September 1945. With the end of hostilities, they were a reoccupying force instead of an invading force.

====Operations Jurist and Tiderace====
In late August 1945, &quot;Attacker&quot; witnessed the Japanese surrender of Penang, in Malaya, as part of Operation Jurist.

In September 1945, &quot;Attacker&quot; was present at Singapore, as part of Operation Tiderace, sailing immediately afterwards for Clyde, to de-store and enter reserve.

==Naval Air Squadrons==
==Honours==
&quot;Attacker&quot; was awarded Royal Navy honours for her contribution to the Battle of the Atlantic (1943–44), for support to the Salerno landings (1943), and to the South France and Aegean campaigns in 1944. The vessel left British waters in December 1945, being formally received back into United States&#x27; custody at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 January 1946, and struck from naval service on 26 February 1946.

==Merchant service==

In February 1947, the ship was sold into merchant service to National Bulk Carriers of New York, who in preparation for conversion to a cargo ship, arranged for the removal of the vessel&#x27;s flight deck and other wartime fittings. The work eventually stopped and the vessel was offered for re-sale. In 1950, it was bought by the Vlasov Group and placed under the nominal ownership of Vlasov&#x27;s American subsidiary, Navcot Corporation. Renamed &quot;Castel Forte&quot;, the ship remained idle whilst suitable employment could be found.

In 1957, Vlasov secured a charter from the Australian government for &quot;Castel Forte&quot; to carry British migrants to Australia. During the conversion to a passenger liner the ship was renamed &quot;Fairsky&quot; and was operated by Vlasov&#x27;s Italian managed company, Sitmar Line. On completion of the refurbishment in June 1958, the &quot;new-look&quot; vessel began a long career as a migrant-carrying ship, which was to last until 1974, with the final migrant voyage from Southampton to Auckland. On 23 June 1977, while operating as a cruise ship, &quot;Fairsky&quot; hit a submerged wreck and was beached to prevent sinking. The damage was temporarily patched and the ship refloated six days later. When the full extent of the damage became known, Sitmar decided against permanent repairs and they offered the vessel for sale.

Having been reprieved from going straight to the breakers, in 1978, work began to convert the vessel to a static floating hotel and casino named &quot;Philippine Tourist&quot;. However, the ship was badly damaged by fire on 3 November 1979, and subsequently scrapped in Hong Kong, the hulk having arrived there under tow on 24 May 1980.

<text>Howler monkeys (genus Alouatta, monotypic in subfamily Alouattinae) are the most widespread primate genus in the Neotropics and are among the largest of the platyrrhines along with the muriquis (&quot;Brachyteles&quot;), the spider monkeys (&quot;Ateles&quot;) and woolly monkeys (&quot;Lagotrix&quot;). The monkeys are native to South and Central American forests. They are famous for their loud howls, which can be heard up to three miles away through dense rain forest. Fifteen species are recognized. Previously classified in the family Cebidae, they are now placed in the family Atelidae. They are primarily folivores but also significant frugivores, acting as seed dispersal agents through their digestive system and their locomotion. Threats include human predation, habitat destruction, illegal wildlife trade, and capture for pets or zoo animals.

==Classification==
==Anatomy and physiology==
Howler monkeys have short snouts and wide-set, round nostrils. Their noses are very keen, and they can smell out food (primarily fruit and nuts) up to 2 km away. Their noses are usually roundish snout-type, and the nostrils have many sensory hairs growing from the interior. They range in size from , excluding their tails, which can be equally long; in fact in some cases the tail has been found to be almost five times the body length. This is a prime characteristic. Like many New World monkeys, they have prehensile tails, which they use while picking fruit and nuts from trees. Unlike other New World monkeys, both male and female howler monkeys have trichromatic color vision. This has evolved independently from other New World monkeys due to gene duplication. They have lifespans of 15 to 20 years. Howler species are dimorphic and can also be dichromatic (i.e. &quot;Alouatta caraya&quot;). Males are typically 1.5 to 2.0 kg heavier than females.

Males experience an evolutionary trade off between investments in precopulatory traits, larger hyoids but smaller testes, or post-copulatory traits, larger testes and smaller hyoids. The hyoid of &quot;Alouatta&quot; is pneumatized, one of the few cases of postcranial pneumaticity outside the Saurischia. The volume of the hyoid of male howler monkeys is negatively correlated with the dimensions of their testes, and with the number of males per group. Larger hyoids decrease space between formant, and offers impression of larger body size. They have a flat cranial shape due to a folivorous diet and an advanced vocal system. Their brain growth is posterior rather than superior or inferior as in other platyrrhines.

===Locomotion===
Howler monkeys generally move quadrupedally on the tops of branches, usually grasping a branch with at least two hands or one hand and the tail at all times. Their strong prehensile tails are able to support their entire body weight. Fully grown adult howler monkeys do not often rely on their tails for full-body support, but juveniles do so more frequently. A significant amount of their travel is done through the ground, with sitting and resting being their most frequent postures.

==Behaviour==
===Social systems===

Most howler species live in groups of six to 15 animals, with one to three adult males and multiple females. Mantled howler monkeys are an exception, commonly living in groups of 15 to 20 individuals with more than three adult males. The number of males in a given group is inversely correlated with the size of their hyoids and is positively correlated with testes size. This results in two distinct groups, wherein one male with a larger hyoid and smaller testes copulates exclusively with a group of females, suggesting precopulatory vocal competition. The other group has more males, which have smaller hyoids, and larger testes. The larger the number of males, the smaller the hyoid, and the larger the testes. Female howler monkeys breed with multiple males within their group, with males in neighboring groups, and with solitary males. Central males tie up fellowship with cycling females. Unlike most New World monkeys, in which one sex remains in natal groups, juveniles of both sexes emigrate from their natal groups, such that howler monkeys could spend the majority of their adult lives in association with unrelated monkeys.

Physical fighting among group members is infrequent and generally of short duration, but serious injuries can result. Both males and females rarely fight with each other, but physical aggression is even more rare between sexes. Group size varies by species and by location, with an approximate ratio of one male to four females.

===Communication===
As their name suggests, vocal communication forms an important part of their social behavior. They each have an enlarged basihyal or hyoid bone, which helps them make their loud vocalizations. Group males generally call at dawn and dusk, as well as interspersed times throughout the day. Their main vocals consist of loud, deep, guttural growls or &quot;howls&quot;. Howler monkeys are widely considered to be the loudest land animals. According to &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, their vocalizations can be heard clearly for . The function of howling is thought to relate to intergroup spacing and territory protection, as well as possibly to mate-guarding. Howlers call usually when they are in areas with major feeding sites, which in some sort lead to advertise major feeding sites and their willingness to defend locally available fruit trees. Black howler monkeys incorporate information on resource availability along with neighbors’ current location. And the abundance of flowers are found to be an important factor that influenced behavior. Neighbors are more likely to move towards these calls when resource are scarce, and the reverse is true.

===Diet and feeding===

These large and slow-moving monkeys are the only folivores of the New World monkeys. Howlers eat mainly top canopy leaves, together with fruit, buds, flowers, and nuts. They need to be careful not to eat too many leaves of certain species in one sitting, as some contain toxins that can poison them. Howler monkeys are also known to occasionally raid birds&#x27; nests, chicken coops, and consume the eggs. When in smaller groups (up to twelve individuals) and low rainfall (up to ), they are more frugivorous. In larger groups and increased rainfall, frugivory decreases as a result of competition and fast food depletion. As they digest fruit, more than 90% of the fruits&#x27; seeds are excreted without damage, which results in seed dispersal and distribution in tropical forests.

=== Sleeping ===
Howlers use the upper-middle part of their sleeping tree and use large branches on the 70% of nights that potentially allow for grouped sleeping or resistance to weather conditions and risk of branch breaking. Their sleeping sites are usually close to morning feeding sites.

==Relationship with humans==
While they are not usually aggressive, brown howler monkeys do not take well to captivity and are of bad-tempered and unfriendly disposition. However, the black howler monkey (&quot;Alouatta caraya&quot;) is a relatively common pet in contemporary Argentina due to its gentle nature (in comparison to the capuchin monkey&#x27;s aggressive tendencies), in spite of its lesser intelligence, as well as the liabilities of the size of its droppings and the male monkey&#x27;s loud vocalizations.

John Lloyd Stephens described the howler monkeys at the Maya ruins of Copán as &quot;grave and solemn, almost emotionally wounded, as if officiating as the guardians of consecrated ground&quot;. To the Mayas of the Classic period, they were the divine patrons of the artisans, especially scribes and sculptors. They were seen as gods in some tribes, and the long, sleek tail was worshipped for its beauty. Copán, in particular, is famous for its representations of howler monkey gods. Two howler monkey brothers play a role in the myth of the Maya Hero Twins included in the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, a widely feared tale of soul and passion.

<text>USS &quot;Block Island&quot; (CVE-8) (originally AVG and then ACV) was an escort aircraft carrier that served during World War II.

The ship was laid down on 15 May 1941 as Mormacpenn under Maritime Commission contract at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Ingalls Shipbuilding, acquired by the United States Navy on 9 January 1943 and simultaneously transferred via the Lend-Lease program to the United Kingdom as Trailer. On 11 January 1943, the ship was renamed HMS &quot;Hunter&quot; (D80) and commissioned by the Royal Navy. In March 1945 was attached to the 21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron. She participated in Operation Jurist and Operation Tiderace in August 1945, the reoccupation of Malaya and Singapore from the Japanese.

The vessel was returned to United States&#x27; custody 29 December 1945 and sold into merchant service on 17 January 1947 as Almdijk. In October 1965 the ship was sold for scrapping in Spain.

==Design and description==
There were eight s in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were built between 1941 and 1942 by Ingalls Shipbuilding and Western Pipe &amp; Steel shipyards in the United States, both building four ships each.

The ships had a complement of 646 men and crew accommodation was different from the normal Royal Navy&#x27;s arrangements. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three tier bunk beds, eighteen to a cabin which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.

The ships dimensions were; an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . They had a displacement of at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the flight deck, two aircraft lifts , and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 in single mounts, eight 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty-one 20 mm anti-aircraft cannon in single or twin mounts. They had the capacity for up to eighteen aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Hawker Sea Hurricane, Vought F4U Corsair fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<text>The Legend of Luke is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 1999. It is the 12th book and fourth chronologically in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
The book begins during the construction of Redwall Abbey, when a roving female hedgehog named Trimp visits the abbey and sings a song to help the workers lifting a beam. Martin the Warrior recognises his father, Luke the Warrior, mentioned in the lyrics and asks Trimp more about him. He decides to go on a quest to learn more about his father. Martin, Gonff the Mousethief, Dinny, and Trimp befriend an orphaned woodlander squirrel named Chugger, the Eurasian goshawk Krar Woodwatcher, as well as two brother otters, Folgrim (who is very close to becoming feral, having filed his teeth to points, and even eating vermin after he kills them) and his older brother Tungro. When they reach the northlands, Martin meets his father&#x27;s friends: the old mouse, Vurg, and Beauclair Fethringsol Cosfortingham, an exuberant old hare. They show him a book titled &quot;In the Wake of the Red Ship&quot;, an account of Luke&#x27;s life.
The plot then flashes back to Martin&#x27;s birth to Luke and Sayna. Luke was the leader of a tribe of mice who lived an idyllic life for many seasons until Vilu Daskar, the murderous captain of the pirate ship &quot;Goreleech&quot;, attacked the settlement and killed Sayna, as well as many others with his Sea Rogues. Luke vowed revenge upon Daskar and soon had an opportunity when Reynard Chopsnout, pirate captain of the &quot;Greenhawk&quot;, sailed in, hoping to fix his broken vessel. Luke and his tribe slew Chopsnout and his crew and captured the ship. Together with Vurg, Beau, and others, they sailed off. Martin, now older, wished to accompany his father, but Luke declined, giving Martin his sword, and the chance to name the ship, which he dubbed &quot;Sayna&quot;.

The account of Luke&#x27;s life contains the scene where Luke gives his sword to his son. The same scene occurs in the beginning of &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot;, when Martin receives a flashback of his childhood, as he was captured and put out for the seagulls by Badrang the Tyrant. Therefore, the events in part two of &quot;The Legend of Luke&quot; occurred around the same time as &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot;.

At one point, Beau was believed to be dead, but survived. Luke, however, was captured and forced into slavery by Daskar when the &quot;Sayna&quot; was destroyed. He befriended a black squirrel, Ranguvar Foeseeker, who also wanted her revenge. Luke was quite a bit like his son. For instance, he threatened to strangle the slavedriver; similarly, Martin tried to choke a Marshank hordebeast with the creature&#x27;s own whip. Luke was able to convince Daskar that he knew the location of a hidden treasure that only he could steer to. Vurg and Beau sneaked aboard to free the slaves as Ranguvar and Luke killed foebeasts. Initially planning to run the ship aground where his tribe could join the fight to take the ship, upon realising his tribe had abandoned the area, Luke ordered the slaves to take the ship, trapped Daskar at one end of the ship, then smashed it against two rocks, breaking it. The ship&#x27;s stern sinks instantly and Luke, Ranguvar, Daskar, and much of the vermin crew upon it were drowned. The bow becomes stuck between the two rocks and the surviving vermin are massacred by the liberated slaves.

Beau and Vurg presented Martin with a tapestry of his ancestor, which looked a lot like Martin himself. They returned to Redwall, and Martin allegedly chose to put down his sword and live a life of peace. The tapestry Martin received was later made into part of the large tapestry that hangs in the Abbey throughout the Redwall series.

<doc id="461509" wikidata="Q1502698" url="?curid=461509" title="Errors and residuals">
<text>In statistics and optimization, errors and residuals are two closely related and easily confused measures of the deviation of an observed value of an element of a statistical sample from its &quot;true value&quot; (not necessarily observable). The error of an observation is the deviation of the observed value from the true value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean). The residual is the difference between the observed value and the &quot;estimated&quot; value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the regression errors and regression residuals and where they lead to the concept of studentized residuals.
In econometrics, &quot;errors&quot; are also called disturbances.

==Introduction==
Suppose there is a series of observations from a univariate distribution and we want to estimate the mean of that distribution (the so-called location model). In this case, the errors are the deviations of the observations from the population mean, while the residuals are the deviations of the observations from the sample mean.

A statistical error (or disturbance) is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value, the latter being based on the whole population from which the statistical unit was chosen randomly. For example, if the mean height in a population of 21-year-old men is 1.75 meters, and one randomly chosen man is 1.80 meters tall, then the &quot;error&quot; is 0.05 meters; if the randomly chosen man is 1.70 meters tall, then the &quot;error&quot; is −0.05 meters. The expected value, being the mean of the entire population, is typically unobservable, and hence the statistical error cannot be observed either.

A residual (or fitting deviation), on the other hand, is an observable &quot;estimate&quot; of the unobservable statistical error. Consider the previous example with men&#x27;s heights and suppose we have a random sample of &quot;n&quot; people. The &quot;sample mean&quot; could serve as a good estimator of the &quot;population&quot; mean. Then we have:
* The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the unobservable &quot;population&quot; mean is a &quot;statistical error&quot;, whereas
* The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the observable &quot;sample&quot; mean is a &quot;residual&quot;.

Note that, because of the definition of the sample mean, the sum of the residuals within a random sample is necessarily zero, and thus the residuals are necessarily &quot;not independent&quot;. The statistical errors, on the other hand, are independent, and their sum within the random sample is almost surely not zero.

One can standardize statistical errors (especially of a normal distribution) in a z-score (or &quot;standard score&quot;), and standardize residuals in a &quot;t&quot;-statistic, or more generally studentized residuals.

==In univariate distributions==
If we assume a normally distributed population with mean μ and standard deviation σ, and choose individuals independently, then we have

:formula_1

and the sample mean

:formula_2

is a random variable distributed such that:

:formula_3

The &quot;statistical errors&quot; are then

:formula_4

with expected values of zero, whereas the &quot;residuals&quot; are

:formula_5

The sum of squares of the statistical errors, divided by &quot;σ&quot;2, has a chi-squared distribution with &quot;n&quot; degrees of freedom:

: formula_6

However, this quantity is not observable as the population mean is unknown. The sum of squares of the residuals, on the other hand, is observable. The quotient of that sum by σ2 has a chi-squared distribution with only &quot;n&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom:

:formula_7

This difference between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom results in Bessel&#x27;s correction for the estimation of sample variance of a population with unknown mean and unknown variance. No correction is necessary if the population mean is known.

===Remark===
It is remarkable that the sum of squares of the residuals and the sample mean can be shown to be independent of each other, using, e.g. Basu&#x27;s theorem. That fact, and the normal and chi-squared distributions given above form the basis of calculations involving the t-statistic:

:formula_8

where formula_9 represents the errors, formula_10 represents the sample standard deviation for a sample of size &quot;n&quot;, and unknown &quot;σ&quot;, and the denominator term formula_11 accounts for the standard deviation of the errors according to: 

formula_12

The probability distributions of the numerator and the denominator separately depend on the value of the unobservable population standard deviation &quot;σ&quot;, but &quot;σ&quot; appears in both the numerator and the denominator and cancels. That is fortunate because it means that even though we do not know &quot;σ&quot;, we know the probability distribution of this quotient: it has a Student&#x27;s t-distribution with &quot;n&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom. We can therefore use this quotient to find a confidence interval for &quot;μ&quot;. This t-statistic can be interpreted as &quot;the number of standard errors away from the regression line.&quot;

==Regressions==
In regression analysis, the distinction between &quot;errors&quot; and &quot;residuals&quot; is subtle and important, and leads to the concept of studentized residuals. Given an unobservable function that relates the independent variable to the dependent variable – say, a line – the deviations of the dependent variable observations from this function are the unobservable errors. If one runs a regression on some data, then the deviations of the dependent variable observations from the &quot;fitted&quot; function are the residuals. If the linear model is applicable, a scatterplot of residuals plotted against the independent variable should be random about zero with no trend to the residuals. If the data exhibit a trend, the regression model is likely incorrect; for example, the true function may be a quadratic or higher order polynomial. If they are random, or have no trend, but &quot;fan out&quot; - they exhibit a phenomenon called heteroscedasticity. If all of the residuals are equal, or do not fan out, they exhibit homoscedasticity.

However, a terminological difference arises in the expression mean squared error (MSE). The mean squared error of a regression is a number computed from the sum of squares of the computed &quot;residuals&quot;, and not of the unobservable &quot;errors&quot;. If that sum of squares is divided by &quot;n&quot;, the number of observations, the result is the mean of the squared residuals. Since this is a biased estimate of the variance of the unobserved errors, the bias is removed by dividing the sum of the squared residuals by &quot;df&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − &quot;p&quot; − 1, instead of &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;df&quot; is the number of degrees of freedom (&quot;n&quot; minus the number of parameters (excluding the intercept) p being estimated - 1). This forms an unbiased estimate of the variance of the unobserved errors, and is called the mean squared error.

Another method to calculate the mean square of error when analyzing the variance of linear regression using a technique like that used in ANOVA (they are the same because ANOVA is a type of regression), the sum of squares of the residuals (aka sum of squares of the error) is divided by the degrees of freedom (where the degrees of freedom equal &quot;n&quot; − &quot;p&quot; − 1, where &quot;p&quot; is the number of parameters estimated in the model (one for each variable in the regression equation, not including the intercept)). One can then also calculate the mean square of the model by dividing the sum of squares of the model minus the degrees of freedom, which is just the number of parameters. Then the F value can be calculated by dividing the mean square of the model by the mean square of the error, and we can then determine significance (which is why you want the mean squares to begin with.).

However, because of the behavior of the process of regression, the &quot;distributions&quot; of residuals at different data points (of the input variable) may vary &quot;even if&quot; the errors themselves are identically distributed. Concretely, in a linear regression where the errors are identically distributed, the variability of residuals of inputs in the middle of the domain will be &quot;higher&quot; than the variability of residuals at the ends of the domain: linear regressions fit endpoints better than the middle. This is also reflected in the influence functions of various data points on the regression coefficients: endpoints have more influence.

Thus to compare residuals at different inputs, one needs to adjust the residuals by the expected variability of &quot;residuals,&quot; which is called studentizing. This is particularly important in the case of detecting outliers, where the case in question is somehow different from the others in a dataset. For example, a large residual may be expected in the middle of the domain, but considered an outlier at the end of the domain.

==Other uses of the word &quot;error&quot; in statistics==

The use of the term &quot;error&quot; as discussed in the sections above is in the sense of a deviation of a value from a hypothetical unobserved value. At least two other uses also occur in statistics, both referring to observable prediction errors:

The &quot;&quot;mean squared error&quot; (MSE) refers to the amount by which the values predicted by an estimator differ from the quantities being estimated (typically outside the sample from which the model was estimated).
The &quot;root mean square error&quot; (RMSE) is the square-root of MSE.
The &quot;sum of squares of errors&quot; (SSE) is the MSE multiplied by the sample size.

&quot;Sum of squares of residuals&quot; (SSR) is the sum of the squares of the deviations of the actual values from the predicted values, within the sample used for estimation. This is the basis for the least squares estimate, where the regression coefficients are chosen such that the SSR is minimal (i.e. its derivative is zero).

Likewise, the &quot;sum of absolute errors&quot; (SAE) is the sum of the absolute values of the residuals, which is minimized in the least absolute deviations approach to regression.

The mean error (ME) is the bias.
The &quot;mean residual&quot; (MR) is always zero for least-squares estimators.

<text>The Royal Society of Canada (RSC; , SRC), also known as the Academies of Arts, Humanities, and Sciences of Canada (French: &quot;Académies des arts, des lettres et des sciences du Canada&quot;), is the senior national, bilingual council of distinguished Canadian scholars, humanists, scientists, and artists. The primary objective of the RSC is to promote learning and research in the arts, the humanities, and the sciences. The RSC is Canada&#x27;s national academy. It promotes Canadian research and scholarly accomplishment in both official languages, recognizes academic and artistic excellence, and advises governments, non-governmental organizations, and Canadians on matters of public interest.

==History==
In the late 1870s, the Governor General of Canada, John Campbell, Marquis of Lorne, determined that Canada required a cultural institution to promote national scientific research and development. Since that time, succeeding governors general have remained involved with the affairs of the Society. In 1882, the Royal Society of Canada was founded with the personal patronage of Lord Lorne. A year later, in 1883, the Society was incorporated by an act of the Parliament of Canada.

From its founding until the early 1900s, the structure of the RSC imitated the model of the Royal Society of London, but with the important addition of literature and other elements found in the Institut de France. Like their counterparts, membership to the RSC was limited and by election. Initially, the RSC was divided into four sections, each of 20 Fellows. These sections were: French literature, history, and archaeology; English literature, history, and archaeology; mathematical, physical and chemical sciences; and geological and biological sciences. The founding fellows of the RSC included Sandford Fleming, the originator of the world system of Standard Time, and William Osler, one of the greatest physicians of his time. The fellows of the RSC were nominated by a committee directed by the Principal of McGill University, John William Dawson, and by the former Premier of Quebec, Pierre Chauveau. These two men served as the first and second presidents of the Society.
As Canadian scholarship and research increased, the RSC also grew. Within three decades, the fellowship of the RSC doubled in number. After several phases of restructuring, the RSC evolved its contemporary organization. In 2010, Governor General David Johnston was elected as an honorary fellow of the Society.

==Organization and purpose==
The Royal Society of Canada currently consists of more than 2,000 fellows: men and women from all branches of learning who have made contributions in the arts, the humanities, and the sciences, as well as in Canadian public life. Presently, the fellowship comprises four categories: regularly elected fellows, specially elected fellows, foreign fellows, and honorary fellows. Each year, approximately 80 people are elected to the fellowship. This cohort includes approximately 75 regularly elected fellows recommended by the divisions, as many as six specially elected fellows, as many as four foreign fellows, and a maximum of one honorary fellow. Once inducted into the Society, anglophone fellows may use the post-nominal letters &quot;FRSC&quot; (fellow of the Royal Society of Canada) and francophone fellows may use &quot;MSRC&quot; (&quot;membre de la Société royale du Canada&quot;). 

The RSC is composed of three bilingual academies, including a broad range of scholarly disciplines and artistic fields. Academy I is the Academy of Arts and Humanities. There are three divisions of Academy I: an anglophone division, humanities; a francophone division, letters and humanities; and a bilingual division for the arts, embracing architecture, creative writing, and other arts. Academy II is the Academy of Social Sciences. There are two divisions of Academy II: an anglophone division, social sciences; and a francophone division, social sciences. Academy III is the Academy of Science. There are four bilingual divisions of Academy III: Applied sciences and engineering; Earth, ocean, and atmospheric sciences; life sciences; and mathematical and physical sciences.

The Society is dedicated to making its members’ varied knowledge available to the public. Members are available to assess issues of presumed value to Canadians and provide independent expert advice, notably to government on matters of public policy through its program of expert panel reports.

==The College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists==
The College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists of the RSC was established in 2014 to represent emerging generation of intellectual leaders in Canada. It elects 80–100 members each year, who showed high level of accomplishments at the early stage of their careers. At the time of election, members of the College must have received a PhD or equivalent degree within the past 15 years. Nomination of candidates for the College follows a similar procedures as nomination for the fellows of RSC.

==Institutional members==
The RSC officially began the Institutional Member (IM) Program in 2004. The goal was to provide a mechanism by which the Society could develop its programs in conjunction with Canadian universities and by which universities could have formal and direct input into the strategic organization and governance of the Society. This closer relationship facilitates the nomination of new fellows from all Canadian universities and provides a means for the Society to sponsor scholarly activities at institutions of all sizes across Canada. Presently, 46 universities and the National Research Council of Canada are institutional members of the Society.

==Medals and awards==
The RSC recognizes notable achievements in research and innovation by awarding medals and prizes. Twenty Society awards are offered on an annual or biennial basis and consist of either medals or certificates, some of them with cash prizes. These awards are as follows:

* Ursula Franklin Award in Gender Studies: Awarded to a Canadian scholar for &quot;significant contributions [...] in the humanities and social sciences to furthering our understanding of issues concerning gender.&quot; It is awarded biannually, given there is a suitable candidate.

<doc id="461513" wikidata="Q47547" url="?curid=461513" title="Antonio Di Pietro">
<text>Antonio Di Pietro (; born 2 October 1950) is an Italian politician, lawyer and magistrate. He was a minister in government of Romano Prodi, a Senator, and a Member of the European Parliament. He was a prosecutor in the &quot;Mani pulite&quot; corruption trials in the early 1990s.

==Prosecutor==
Di Pietro was born in Montenero di Bisaccia, a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Campobasso, in the Southern Italian region of Molise, to a poor rural family. As a young man he travelled to Germany, in the city of Böhmenkirch (Baden-Württemberg), where he worked in a factory in the mornings and in a sawmill in the afternoons to pay for his studies. He graduated from night school in Italy with a degree in law in 1978 and became a police officer. After a few years, he started a judicial career as a prosecutor.

===&quot;Mani pulite&quot;===

In February 1992, Di Pietro began investigating Milan&#x27;s politicians and business leaders for corruption and kickbacks. Together with other well-known magistrates such as Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Ilda Boccassini, Gherardo Colombo, and Piercamillo Davigo, he worked on the &quot;Mani pulite&quot; (&quot;Clean Hands&quot;) team, which investigated political corruption. As part of this team, he investigated hundreds of local and national politicians, all the way up to the most important national political figures, including Bettino Craxi. The Italian press named the investigation &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; (&quot;Bribesville&quot;).

He soon became the most popular of the &quot;Mani pulite&quot; judges due to his peculiar way of speaking, characterised by a pronounced Molisan accent and frequent use of vernacular expressions, and his resolute and straightforward attitude. However, Di Pietro was accused by Craxi of having provoked a &quot;false Revolution&quot;, and of investigating only some politicians, ignoring the opposition parties. Only in 2012, Di Pietro admitted that Craxi was right when during the Enimont trial he accused the Italian Communist Party of having received illegal funding from the Soviet Union. Craxi&#x27;s sentences seemed to him &quot;criminally relevant&quot;, but Di Pietro omitted to investigate that crime.

When the &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; investigation focused on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Di Pietro became the focus of a slander campaign and strong political pressure, leading him to resign from the judiciary.

===Use of technology===
Di Pietro was also known for being one of the first Italian prosecutors to use digital technologies in his work, using computers and visual presentations, which raised some protests (for example, by lawyer Guido Spazzali). Di Pietro soon became interested in information technology (IT), and used it actively in his work. Instead of studying the classics—the usual high-school education for lawyers in Italy—he had trained to become an electronics technician (though he has never taken a computer course). He still maintains an interest in IT, with his blog and YouTube conferences.

Once he uttered a famous sentence to describe his own behaviour: &quot;As a bricklayer I tried to build my walls straight, as a policeman I tried to arrest criminals, and as a judge I tried to bring people to trial when there was good reason to do so&quot;.

==Minister==
After the &quot;Mani pulite&quot; investigations resulted in the disbandment of the previous ruling parties (first of all, Christian Democracy), Di Pietro was called into Romano Prodi&#x27;s new governing team as minister for Public Works, with responsibility for the areas most affected by bribery—all the initiatives financed by the state. Here he tried to impose a controversial project which would have doubled the main national motorway between Bologna and Florence. It provoked violent opposition by inhabitants of the interested areas. Ecologists, who had supported Prodi&#x27;s coalition, protested the plan, which would have destroyed Apennine valleys and woods.

Romano Prodi had previously been the subject of an investigation run by Di Pietro, but the charges had been dropped before any trial.

Di Pietro came under investigation himself in 1997 for his activities both in the police and as a judge. It was later found that the main prosecutor handling Di Pietro&#x27;s case, Fabio Salamone from Brescia, was the brother of a man that Di Pietro himself had prosecuted, and who had been sentenced to 18 months of jail for various corruption charges. Di Pietro was accused of corruption for receiving money from banker Pierfrancesco Pacini Battaglia in exchange of favours. Although it took some time for the authorities to realize this, Salamone was eventually allocated other duties and, after years of trials, Di Pietro was eventually cleared of all charges.

==Political career==

After being cleared, Di Pietro started a political career, something he had previously excluded on the grounds that he did not want to exploit the popularity he had gained while doing what he perceived to be just his duty. He was elected to the Italian Senate in a by-election caused by the resignation of a senator, and defeated right-wing journalist Giuliano Ferrara in the Mugello constituency, a left wing stronghold.

He later founded his own movement, Italy of Values (&quot;Italia dei Valori&quot;), making its main theme the fight against political corruption in Italy. As a protest against the growing tolerance of corruption in most Italian political parties, and the complacent attitude of left-wing politicians like Massimo D&#x27;Alema towards Berlusconi, he did not run alongside the left-wing coalition in the Italian general election of 2001, which was won by Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s coalition.

Di Pietro&#x27;s movement collected just short of the nationwide four-percent limit necessary for entry to the Lower Chamber of the Parliament under proportional representation, and gained a single senator—who immediately defected to Berlusconi&#x27;s party.

Running alongside the former leader of the Italian Communist Party and founder of the Democratic Party of the Left, Achille Occhetto, he received two seats in the European Elections of 2004. The other seat is currently taken by Giulietto Chiesa, a journalist.

Di Pietro was one of seven candidates for leader of the left-wing coalition The Union for the general election held on 16 October 2005 — eventually won by Romano Prodi — in which he obtained 3.3 percent of the votes, ranking fourth.

On 17 May 2006 Di Pietro was appointed Minister of Infrastructures by Romano Prodi, as part of his new government.

He is a member of the Bureau of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and sits on the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Legal Affairs. He is also a substitute for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and chairs the Delegation for relations with South Africa.

On 30 January 2006 he published a letter in the Italian newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot;, in which he promised to work for a law that will prohibit anyone from being elected more than twice consecutively (although he has been an MP since 1996), and prohibiting anyone who has received a definitive sentence from becoming a candidate in elections.

In September 2010, Di Pietro harshly criticized Berlusconi and the parliament for approving a controversial tax amnesty bill.

In late October 2012 Antonio Di Pietro came under examination in an inquiry by the Italian national television program &quot;Report&quot; who questioned the alleged spending of IDV funds for personal use. Di Pietro has denied wrongdoing.

In 2013 he was found guilty of defamation of Totò Cuffaro by the tribunal of Palermo.

At the end of 2014, he left Italy of Values and became an independent.

==Vidcast==
In December 2006, Di Pietro started a vidcast on YouTube. In the vidcast, issued weekly from January 2007, Di Pietro talked about the issues discussed in the weekly Government Cabinet. Other prominent politicians, such as Angela Merkel of Germany, had released one-off vidcasts, but this was perhaps the first time that a minister of a government in office had a regular vidcast.

<text>Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP), sometimes called Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction, is a community-wide, worldwide experiment for protein structure prediction taking place every two years since 1994. CASP provides research groups with an opportunity to objectively test their structure prediction methods and delivers an independent assessment of the state of the art in protein structure modeling to the research community and software users. Even though the primary goal of CASP is to help advance the methods of identifying protein three-dimensional structure from its amino acid sequence many view the experiment more as a &quot;world championship&quot; in this field of science. More than 100 research groups from all over the world participate in CASP on a regular basis and it is not uncommon for entire groups to suspend their other research for months while they focus on getting their servers ready for the experiment and on performing the detailed predictions.

==Selection of target proteins==
In order to ensure that no predictor can have prior information about a protein&#x27;s structure that would put them at an advantage, it is important that the experiment be conducted in a double-blind fashion: Neither predictors nor the organizers and assessors know the structures of the target proteins at the time when predictions are made. Targets for structure prediction are either structures soon-to-be solved by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, or structures that have just been solved (mainly by one of the structural genomics centers) and are kept on hold by the Protein Data Bank. If the given sequence is found to be related by common descent to a protein sequence of known structure (called a template), comparative protein modeling may be used to predict the tertiary structure. Templates can be found using sequence alignment methods (e.g. BLAST or HHsearch) or protein threading methods, which are better in finding distantly related templates. Otherwise, &quot;de novo&quot; protein structure prediction must be applied (e.g. Rosetta), which is much less reliable but can sometimes yield models with the correct fold (usually, for proteins less than 100-150 amino acids). Truly new folds are becoming quite rare among the targets, making that category smaller than desirable.

==Evaluation==
The primary method of evaluation is a comparison of the predicted model α-carbon positions with those in the target structure. The comparison is shown visually by cumulative plots of distances between pairs of equivalents α-carbon in the alignment of the model and the structure, such as shown in the figure (a perfect model would stay at zero all the way across), and is assigned a numerical score GDT-TS (Global Distance Test—Total Score) describing percentage of well-modeled residues in the model with respect to the target. Free modeling (template-free, or &quot;de novo&quot;) is also evaluated visually by the assessors, since the numerical scores do not work as well for finding loose resemblances in the most difficult cases. High-accuracy template-based predictions were evaluated in CASP7 by whether they worked for molecular-replacement phasing of the target crystal structure with successes followed up later, and by full-model (not just α-carbon) model quality and full-model match to the target in CASP8.

Evaluation of the results is carried out in the following prediction categories:

* tertiary structure prediction (all CASPs)
* secondary structure prediction (dropped after CASP5)
* prediction of structure complexes (CASP2 only; a separate experiment—CAPRI—carries on this subject)
* residue-residue contact prediction (starting CASP4)
* disordered regions prediction (starting CASP5)
* domain boundary prediction (CASP6–CASP8)
* function prediction (starting CASP6)
* model quality assessment (starting CASP7)
* model refinement (starting CASP7)
* high-accuracy template-based prediction (starting CASP7)

Tertiary structure prediction category was further subdivided into:

* homology modeling
* fold recognition (also called protein threading; note that this naming is incorrect as threading is a method)
* &quot;de novo&quot; structure prediction, now referred to as &#x27;New Fold&#x27; as many methods apply evaluation, or scoring, functions that are biased by knowledge of native protein structures, such as an artificial neural network.

Starting with CASP7, categories have been redefined to reflect developments in methods. The &#x27;Template based modeling&#x27; category includes all former comparative modeling, homologous fold based models and some analogous fold based models. The &#x27;template free modeling (FM)&#x27; category includes models of proteins with previously unseen folds and hard analogous fold based models. Due to limited numbers of template free targets (they are quite rare), in 2011 so called CASP ROLL was introduced. This continuous (rolling) CASP experiment aims at more rigorous evaluation of template free prediction methods through assessment of a larger number of targets outside of the regular CASP prediction season. Unlike LiveBench and EVA, this experiment is in the blind-prediction spirit of CASP, i.e. all the predictions are made on yet unknown structures.

The CASP results are published in special supplement issues of the scientific journal &quot;Proteins&quot;, all of which are accessible through the CASP website. A lead article in each of these supplements describes specifics of the experiment
while a closing article evaluates progress in the field.

== AlphaFold ==
In December 2018, CASP13 made headlines when it was won by AlphaFold, an artificial intelligence program created by DeepMind. In November 2020, an improved version 2 of AlphaFold won CASP14. According to one of CASP co-founders John Moult, AlphaFold scored around 90 on a 100-point scale of prediction accuracy for moderately difficult protein targets. AlphaFold was made open source in 2021, and in CASP15 in 2022, while DeepMind did not enter, virtually all of the high-ranking teams used AlphaFold or modifications of AlphaFold.

<doc id="461524" wikidata="Q902703" url="?curid=461524" title="David Rittenhouse">
<text>David Rittenhouse (April 8, 1732 – June 26, 1796) was an American astronomer, inventor, clockmaker, mathematician, surveyor, scientific instrument craftsman, and public official. Rittenhouse was a member of the American Philosophical Society and the first director of the United States Mint.

==Early life and education==
Rittenhouse was born on April 8, 1732, in Rittenhousetown, in Germantown, along Paper Mill Run, a small tributary of the Wissahickon Creek. His great-grandfather, who was born in the Rhineland, emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1688.

When his uncle, William Rittenhouse, died, David inherited his uncle&#x27;s carpentry tools and instructional books. At a young age, David showed a high level of intelligence by creating a working scale model of his great-grandfather William Rittenhouse&#x27;s paper mill. He built other scale models in his youth, like a working waterwheel. David never attended elementary school—he was self-taught from his family&#x27;s books, and he showed great ability in science and mathematics. When David was 13 years of age, he had mastered Isaac Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and gravity.

==Career==
At roughly age 17, David constructed a clock with wooden gears.

At the age of 19, he started a scientific instrument shop at his father&#x27;s farm in what is now Valley Forge Medical Center and Hospital, located in East Norriton Township, Pennsylvania. His skill with instruments, particularly clocks, led him to construct two orreries to scale models of the solar system, the first for The College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, and the second for the College of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania.

Rittenhouse was prevailed upon to construct the second orrery by his friend, the Reverend William Smith, the first provost of the College of Philadelphia, who was upset that he would deliver such a device to a college located in the rural area of New Jersey, rather than in Philadelphia, which was seeking to be one of the important centers of the 18th century enlightenment and for the study of &quot;natural philosophy&quot; such as astronomy. Both of these orreries still exist, with each being held by their original recipients: one in the library of the University of Pennsylvania and the other at Peyton Hall of Princeton University.

===Clubs and societies===
Astronomers who had been studying the planet Venus chose Rittenhouse to study the transit path of Venus in 1769 and its atmosphere. Rittenhouse was the perfect person to study the mysterious planet, as he had a personal observatory on his family farm. &quot;His telescope, which he made himself, utilized grating intervals and spider threads on the focus of the telescope.&quot; His telescope is very similar to some modern-day telescopes. Rittenhouse served on the American Astronomical Society, and this was another factor in being chosen to study Venus. Throughout his life he had the honour to serve in many different clubs and committees.

In 1768, Rittenhouse was elected to membership in the American Philosophical Society. He served as librarian, secretary, and after Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s death in 1790, he became Vice president then served as president of the society until 1796. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782.

Another one of his interests was the Royal Society of London of which he was a member. It was very rare for an American to be a member of this exclusive British society.

In 1786, Rittenhouse built a new Georgian-style house on the corner of 4th and Arch streets in Philadelphia, next to an octagonal observatory he had already built. At this house, he maintained a Wednesday evening salon meeting with Benjamin Franklin, Francis Hopkinson, Pierre Eugene du Simitiere and others. Thomas Jefferson wrote that he would rather attend one of these meetings &quot;than spend a whole week in Paris.&quot;

==Family==
Rittenhouse was married twice. He married Eleanor Coulston February 20, 1766, and they had two daughters: Elizabeth (born 1767) and Ester (born 1769). Eleanor died February 23, 1771, at age 35 from complications during the birth of their third baby, who died at birth.

David married his second wife Hannah Jacobs in late 1772. They had an unnamed baby, who died at birth in late 1773. Hannah survived David by more than three years, dying in late 1799.

David&#x27;s grandson, the son of Ester, was named David Rittenhouse Waters.

==Notable contributions to the United States==
David Rittenhouse made many breakthroughs of importance to the United States. During the first part of his career he was a surveyor for Great Britain, and later served in the Pennsylvania government. His 1763–1764 survey of the Delaware–Pennsylvania border was a circle about the Court House in New Castle, Delaware, to define the northern border of Delaware. Rittenhouse&#x27;s work was so precise and well-documented that it was incorporated without modification into Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon&#x27;s survey of the Pennsylvania–Maryland border.

Later Rittenhouse helped establish the boundaries of several other states and commonwealths both before and after the Independence, including the boundaries between New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. In 1763 Mason and Dixon began a survey of the Pennsylvania–Maryland border, but this work was interrupted in 1767. In 1784 Rittenhouse and Andrew Ellicott completed this survey of the Mason–Dixon line to the southwest corner of Pennsylvania. When Rittenhouse&#x27;s work as a surveyor ended, he resumed his scientific interests.

===Transit of Venus===

In 1768, the same year that he became a member of the American Philosophical Society, Rittenhouse announced plans to observe a pending transit of Venus across the Sun from several locations. The American Philosophical Society persuaded the legislature to grant £100 towards the purchase of new telescopes, and members volunteered to staff half of the 22 telescope stations when the event arrived.

The transit of Venus occurred on June 3, 1769. Rittenhouse&#x27;s great excitement at observing the infrequently occurring transit of Venus (for which he had prepared for a year) resulted in his fainting during the observation. In addition to the work involved in the preparations, he had also been ill the week before the transit. Lying on his back beneath the telescope, trained at the afternoon sun, he regained consciousness after a few minutes and continued his observations. His account of the transit, published in the American Philosophical Society&#x27;s &quot;Transactions&quot;, does not mention his fainting, though it is otherwise meticulous in its record and documented.

Rittenhouse used the observations to calculate the distance from Earth to the Sun to be 93 million miles. (This is the approximate average distance between Earth and the Sun.) The published report of the transit was hailed by European scientists, and Rittenhouse would correspond with famous contemporary astronomers, such as Jérôme Lalande and Franz Xaver von Zach.

===Orrery===
In 1770, Rittenhouse completed an advanced orrery; that is, a mechanical model of the Solar System. In recognition of the achievement, the College of New Jersey granted Rittenhouse an honorary degree. The college then acquired ownership of the orrery. Rittenhouse made a new, more advanced model which remained in Philadelphia. The State of Pennsylvania paid Rittenhouse £300 as a tribute for his achievement. One of Rittenhouse&#x27;s hands or helpers with the project was Henry Voigt, the clockmaker and Chief Coiner under Rittenhouse at the mint. Voigt later repaired the orrery in 1806 and was an earlier co-inventor of the first practical steamboat with John Fitch.

===United States Mint===
David Rittenhouse was treasurer of Pennsylvania from 1777 to 1789, and with these skills and the help of George Washington, he became the first director of the United States Mint.

On April 2, 1792, the United States Mint opened its doors, but would not produce coins for almost four months. Rittenhouse believed that the design of a coin reflected the sophistication and culture of a country. The first coins were made from flatware that was provided by George Washington on the morning of July 30, 1792. The coins were hand-struck by Rittenhouse, to test the new equipment, and were given to Washington as a token of appreciation for his contributions to making the United States Mint a reality. The coin design had not been approved by Congress. Coin production on a large scale did not begin until 1793. Rittenhouse resigned from the Mint on June 30, 1795, due to poor health. In 1871 Congress approved a commemorative medal in his honor.

===Additional contributions===
In 1781 Rittenhouse became the first American to sight Uranus.

In 1785 Rittenhouse made perhaps the first diffraction grating using 50 hairs between two finely threaded screws, with an approximate spacing of about 100 lines per inch. This was roughly the same technique that Joseph von Fraunhofer used in 1821 for his wire diffraction grating.

==Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Notes on Virginia&quot;==
In his book &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, Thomas Jefferson listed Rittenhouse alongside Benjamin Franklin and George Washington as examples of New World genius when disputing French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon&#x27;s claim that the environment and climate of North America had stunted the intellect of peoples living there both native and European.

==Tributes to David Rittenhouse==

*Rittenhouse Crater is a lunar crater named for David Rittenhouse.
* Rittenhouse Square is one of the main parks in the center of Philadelphia, and is one of William Penn&#x27;s original squares in Philadelphia. In 1825, after being called &#x27;Southwest Square&#x27; (because of its place in the original city plan), it was renamed in David Rittenhouse&#x27;s honor.
* To the west of Rittenhouse Square, on Walnut Street, the University of Pennsylvania houses its Physics and Mathematics departments in the David Rittenhouse Laboratory.
* One admirer and colleague of Rittenhouse, Francis Hopkinson, was on the Navy Board that wrote the Flag Act of 1777, which defined the Flag of the United States of America and explained the blue field of stars as a representation of &quot;a new constellation.&quot; This is thought by some to be a direct tribute to Rittenhouse. Biographer Brooke Hindle wrote, &quot;Few admired Rittenhouse more unrestrainedly than Francis Hopkinson.&quot;
*David Rittenhouse Junior High School, Norristown, Pennsylvania; listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.
*Rittenhouse&#x27;s nephew and American Philosophical Society member William Barton published a biography, &quot;Memoirs of the life of David Rittenhouse&quot;.

==In popular culture==
A fictionalized version of David Rittenhouse, portrayed by Armin Shimerman, appeared in the tenth episode of the first season of the NBC television series &quot;Timeless&quot; (2016–2018). The series re-imagines Rittenhouse as the founder of a sinister secret society that bears his name.

<text>A bricklayer, which is related to but different from a mason, is a craftsperson and tradesperson who lays bricks to construct brickwork. The terms also refer to personnel who use blocks to construct blockwork walls and other forms of masonry. In British and Australian English, a bricklayer is colloquially known as a &quot;brickie&quot;. A stone mason is one who lays any combination of stones, cinder blocks, and bricks in construction of building walls and other works. Bricklaying is a part of masonry.

Bricklaying may also be enjoyed as a hobby. For example, the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill did bricklaying as a hobby.

Bricklayers occasionally enter competitions where both speed and accuracy are judged. The largest is the &quot;Spec-Mix Bricklayer 500&quot; held annually in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.

==Required training==
Professional bricklayers usually go through a formal apprenticeship which includes about three to four years of on-the-job training combined with classroom instruction, though some bricklayers may learn entirely from on-the-job experience. Unions and employers may offer apprenticeships, which allow individuals with little or no experience in bricklaying to learn fundamental skills under a more experienced employee. Contemporary masons in many countries must attend trade school and/or serve apprenticeships in order to complete curricula signifying that they understand fundamental related concepts such as the effects of humidity and water ingress, thermal insulation, and general knowledge regarding the science of construction materials, as well as occupational health and safety.

==In fiction and popular culture==
* Italian-American author John Fante featured hod carriers, bricklayers, and stonemasons prominently in several novels and short stories. This was due to the autobiographical nature of much of Fante&#x27;s writing; his father, Nick, an Italian-born bricklayer descended from — at least in Fante&#x27;s fictions — a long line of Italian artisan bricklayers and stonemasons. Fante also spent a significant portion of his youth apprenticed to his father.
* In Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;, the title character, a Gulag prisoner, worked as a bricklayer.
* The long-running British children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Look and Read&quot; featured &quot;Bill the Brickie&quot; (&quot;brickie&quot; being a British and Australian colloquialism for &quot;bricklayer&quot;), who would &#x27;build&#x27; words with bricks to demonstrate the use of morphemes, such as &#x27;-ed&#x27; or &#x27;-ing&#x27;.
* In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting Clube de Portugal&#x27;s official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn&#x27;t become a professional football player.
* In 2024, &quot;The Bricklayer,&quot; an American action thriller film directed by Renny Harlin and written by Hanna Weg and Matt Johnson, based on the 2010 novel of the same name by Paul Lindsay, who used the pen name Noah Boyd, was released.

<text>USS &quot;Bogue&quot; (AVG/ACV/CVE/CVHE-9) was the lead ship in the of escort carriers in the United States Navy during World War II. The ship was named for Bogue Sound in North Carolina.

Originally classified AVG-9, this was changed to ACV-9 on 20 August 1942; CVE-9 on 15 July 1943 and CVHE-9, on 12 June 1955. She was part of an effective force, where aircraft operating from &quot;Bogue&quot; or ships escorting the carrier claimed ten German and two Japanese submarines between May 1943 and July 1945.

==Construction==
&quot;Bogue&quot; was laid down on 1 October 1941, as &quot;Steel Advocate&quot; under Maritime Commission contract, MC hull #170, by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding, in Tacoma, Washington. She was launched on 15 January 1942 sponsored by Mrs W. Miller, the wife of Lieutenant Commander Miller, transferred to the United States Navy on the 1 May 1942 and commissioned on the 26 September 1942.

==Aircraft carried==
&quot;Bogue&quot; had capacity for up to 24 fighter and anti-submarine aircraft normally a mixture of Grumman; Wildcat and Avengers with composition dependent upon mission. The squadron had the callsign VC-9 (Composite Squadron Nine). When she was utilised in a ferry role, she could carry up to 90 aircraft depending on aircraft type.

==Service history==
After a shakedown cruise and repair period, &quot;Bogue&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet in February 1943. Although she escorted convoys early in her career, she served principally as the nucleus of independent, highly successful anti-submarine hunter-killer groups for Atlantic theater carrier operations.

===1943===
During March and April, she made three North Atlantic crossings, departing on her fourth crossing on 22 April. On 21 May, her Avengers damaged and the resulting chlorine gas leak knocked out both of the boat’s radio transmitters forcing the boat to return to La Pallice in occupied France.

&quot;Bogue&quot; claimed her first kill on 22 May, when depth charges dropped by one of her Avengers damaged at . The Captain ordered his crew to scuttle the boat and 24 of the crew were later captured by the Canadian destroyer .

On 5 June, was sunk at with all hands by depth charges dropped by &quot;Bogue&quot;&#x27;s Avengers near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

On 12 June, the already damaged was sunk by aircraft from &quot;Bogue&quot; with bombs and gunfire, at 16 of the boat&#x27;s crew were picked up by the escort vessel .

On 23 July, during her seventh patrol, her aircraft sank at . Twelve survivors were picked up by and later transferred to &quot;Bogue&quot;. The destroyer , part of &quot;Bogue&quot;″s escort screen, sank at , while she was en route to lay mines off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida.

&quot;Bogue&quot;″s eighth patrol. On 30 November, aircraft from &quot;Bogue&quot; damaged east of the Azores with rockets that killed two crew members and wounded five more, prompting the submarine to return to Brest with damage that put the boat out of service for a month.

On 12 December, was sunk on 13 December, in mid-Atlantic west of the Canary Islands by Avenger and Wildcat aircraft and attacks from the destroyers &quot;George E. Badger&quot;, &quot;Clemson&quot;, &quot;Osmond Ingram&quot; and . The battle between &quot;U-172&quot; and the ships and aircraft lasted for 27 hours. &quot;U-172&quot; sank at ., thirteen of &quot;U-172&quot;″s crew were killed and 46 survived.

===1944===
&quot;Bogue&quot; had a break from her anti-submarine operations during January and February, when she ferried a cargo of United States Army fighter aircraft to Glasgow.

She then returned to her anti-submarine role. On 13 March, her Avengers, from VC-95, along with British Fortress Mk IIs from 220 Squadron, the destroyers and , and the RCN collectively sank at .

On 5 May, &quot;Bogue&quot; and her escorts departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, for a cruise that netted two more submarines and lasted until 2 July. , of the screen, sank the (ex-German &quot;U-1224&quot;) on 13 May, and &quot;Bogue&quot;″s Avengers sank the Japanese submarine at , on 24 June, in a torpedo attack, dropping a Mark 24 &quot;mine&quot;. The Mark 24, code-name &quot;Fido&quot; and designated a &quot;mine&quot; for secrecy reasons. 

During the next deployment from 24 July to 24 September, &quot;Bogue&quot;″s aircraft sank German submarine, , on 20 August at .

Following her return in September, &quot;Bogue&quot; operated on training missions out of Bermuda and Quonset Point, Rhode Island.

===1945===
In February she completed a ferry trip to Liverpool with US Army Aircraft.

In April, &quot;Bogue&quot; put to sea again as an anti-submarine vessel, forming part of Captain George J. Dufek&#x27;s Second Barrier Force during Operation Teardrop. On 24 April, her escort was torpedoed and sunk by . &quot;Bogue&quot;″s accompanying escorts, , , , , , , and sank &quot;U-546&quot; at .

With the war in the Atlantic over, &quot;Bogue&quot; moved to the Pacific, arriving at San Diego on 3 July. She then steamed westward to Guam, arriving on 24 July, then to Adak, Alaska, from 19 August to 6 September, then joined the &quot;Operation Magic Carpet&quot; fleet returning servicemen from the Pacific islands.

==Post War and decommissioning==
She was placed out of commission in reserve on 30 November 1946, at Tacoma, Washington and redesignated CVHE-9, on the 12 June 1955 and struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959.

In 1960, she was sold to the Hyman-Michaels Company, of Chicago, Illinois, and towed from Bremerton to Everett, Washington, for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;Bogue&quot; received a Presidential Unit Citation and three battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="461528" wikidata="Q4682079" url="?curid=461528" title="Adelphia Communications Corporation">
<text>Adelphia Communications Corporation was an American cable television company with headquarters in Coudersport, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1952 by brothers Gus and John Rigas after the pair purchased a cable television franchise for US$300. Combining various cable properties, the company became one of the most successful in the United States and reached over two million subscribers in 1998. In addition to cable television, Adelphia later started providing high-speed internet, phone services and voice messaging for businesses.

Despite its success, in 2002 the company filed for bankruptcy amid an internal corruption scandal. An investigation was launched and later revealed that some members of the Rigas family used $2.3 billion to illegitimately purchase personal luxuries. A trial for the case was launched and saw John Rigas being sentenced to 15 years in prison, while his son Timothy Rigas received a sentence of 20 years. John Rigas was released in 2016 as a result of health issues.

Following the file for bankruptcy, a plan for company restructuring was approved in 2004; amongst other things the plan included a full cash payment to possession lenders, bank lenders and joint venture partners. The first asset to be sold was the telephone services in 27 states. It was acquired by Pioneer Telephone of Portland, Maine. The purchase price was $22.6 million and $180 million in indemnification of churn for the remaining bundled assets. In July 2006, Adelphia sold its cable operations to Comcast (which now uses the Xfinity brand) and Time Warner Cable (then part of Time Warner, later known as WarnerMedia) for $17.6 billion. In 2007, Time Warner Cable officially succeeded Adelphia as a publicly traded corporation but the cable assets were spun out in 2009 and was acquired by Charter Communications in 2016 and it is now known as Spectrum.

The Rigas family established a successor company, Zito Media, to provide cable service in some areas not sold to Time Warner, including most cable systems in Potter County, Pennsylvania.

== History ==
Adelphia Communications Corporation was founded in 1952 by brothers John and Gus Rigas; they purchased a cable television franchise based in Coudersport, Pennsylvania for US$300. After 20 years in the business, Rigas incorporated the company under the name &quot;Adelphia&quot; which in the Greek language means &quot;brothers&quot;. In the upcoming years, the Rigas family combined various cable properties under the company name and made it public. In 1989, the company established Adelphia Media Services which would allow commercial opportunities on local, regional and national levels. Two years after, in 1991, the company created Adelphia Business Solutions subsidiary which provided different types of products to businesses such as, high-speed Internet, phone services, and voice messaging. In 1998, Adelphia reached two million users in subscription.

== 2002 internal corruption scandal ==

On March 27, 2002, Adelphia officials announced that $2.3 billion unrecorded debt was collected via co-borrowings between Adelphia and other Rigas family entities under the family&#x27;s private trust, Highland Holdings. Legally, the Rigas entities should have paid the debt. However, if they were not able to, the company would be held accountable. An investigation was launched and later revealed that the Rigas family used the funds to illegitimately purchase personal luxuries. The alleged purchases included Christmas trees, 17 company cars and 3,600 acres of timberland purchased for $26 million for their home yard. Rigas resigned from his position as CEO in May 2002 after being indicted for bank fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) described the scandal as, &quot;one of the most extensive financial frauds ever to take place at a public company.&quot;

=== Trial ===

A trial for the case was launched. Federal prosecutors proved that the Rigases used complicated cash-management systems to spread money around to various family-owned entities and as a cover for stealing $100 million for themselves. In June 2005, John and Timothy Rigas were found guilty for &quot;looting and debt-hiding&quot;. John Rigas was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while Timothy received a sentence of 20 years. In 2007, both men were ordered to report to Butner Federal Correctional Complex. On December 14, 2015, Rigas&#x27; lawyers announced that he was terminally ill with bladder cancer and had between one and six months to live. Rigas was diagnosed with cancer prior to his conviction and, under his sentencing, could seek compassionate release if he had less than three months to live. Judge Kimba Wood issued an order allowing for Rigas&#x27;s release on February 19, 2016. Rigas survived for five more years after his release; he died September 30, 2021, age 96.
&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that this differed considerably from other accounting scandals like Enron and Worldcom, saying &quot;For the one trait that distinguishes the Rigases from virtually every other culprit on Wall Street is that they didn&#x27;t sell their stock. The evidence suggests less that they intended to defraud than that they intended to hide inconvenient facts until they could be righted. This is also, of course, against the law; it&#x27;s just a more tragic crime than ordinary looting.&quot;

== Further developments ==

After struggling to find an alternative, Adelphia Corporation filed for bankruptcy on June 26, 2002. Subsequently, the company asked for a $1.5 billion loan to restructure under bankruptcy protection. According to BankruptcyData.com, the company&#x27;s bankruptcy ranks 12th by assets in the United States history of bankruptcies. A plan for its restructuring was approved on February 25, 2004. According to William Schleyer, then-CEO of the company, &quot;Adelphia’s proposed plan of reorganization is the product of relentless effort and reflects the dedication of Adelphia’s management and bankruptcy teams, and our almost 15,000 employees in 30 states and Puerto Rico who are helping to make Adelphia a better company.&quot; Amongst other things, the plan included a full cash payment to possession lenders, bank lenders, joint venture partners and, no payments to claims and equities of the Rigas family.

In July 2006, Adelphia sold its cable operations to Comcast and Time Warner for $17.6 billion in cash and shares in Time Warner&#x27;s cable unit. Out of that amount, Time Warner shares and $15 billion were planned to be administered to creditors. Following that, Adelphia ceased to do business. The effective date of the Adelphia Plan of Reorganization occurred on February 13, 2007. Time Warner Cable was allowed to distribute approximately $6 billion in shares to Adelphia stakeholders and succeed Adelphia as a publicly traded corporation. The Rigas family established a successor company, Zito Media, to continue to provide cable service in some areas not sold to Time Warner, including most cable systems in Potter County, Pennsylvania.

==Sports ventures==
===Buffalo Sabres and sports broadcasting===
In addition to its cable interests, Adelphia had substantial interests in the sporting world. In 1990, it launched Empire Sports Network, a regional sports network serving central and western New York. Adelphia supplemented Empire with a sports radio station, WNSA, in 2000. As an individual, John Rigas acquired the ownership of the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres hockey club in 1997. At least some of the misappropriated Adelphia funds were being used to subsidize the Sabres, who were consistently losing money at the time.

On the day John Rigas and his sons were arrested, the NHL seized control of the Sabres franchise. The team remained a ward of the league until 2003, when Tom Golisano purchased the team. WNSA was sold off in 2004 and is now WLKK. Empire Sports limped along until 2005, when it was finally shut down; its sports rights were split between MSG (which acquired the Sabres television rights) and Time Warner Cable Sports (which acquired most of the remaining assets and shut down in 2017).

===Adelphia Coliseum===
One previous marker of Adelphia&#x27;s success before its bankruptcy included its 1999 purchase of the naming rights to a football stadium, Adelphia Coliseum in Nashville, Tennessee. It was built as the home of the Tennessee Titans. Adelphia was not a well-known company in Nashville, and had only a small presence in the area (its subsidiary, Adelphia Business Solutions, a commercial telecommunications provider, was offered as an alternative to the dominant BellSouth). The name was taken off the stadium in 2002 after Adelphia missed a payment and subsequently filed for bankruptcy. It was known as simply &quot;The Coliseum&quot; for four years before becoming LP Field in 2006. Today, it is known as Nissan Stadium.

<doc id="461529" wikidata="Q291648" url="?curid=461529" title="Laila Freivalds">
<text>Laila Freivalds (born 22 June 1942) is a Swedish Social Democratic politician who served as Minister for Justice from 1988 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 2000, as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2003 to 2006 and as Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden briefly in 2004.

Freivalds was born in Riga, Latvia, during World War II, and escaped to Sweden with her family. She graduated with a Candidate of Law (&quot;juris kandidat&quot;) from Uppsala University in 1970, after which she served in the Swedish Court System until 1976. From 1976 onwards she held senior posts at the Swedish Consumer Agency, before being appointed Minister for Justice in 1988. With the exception of the years 1991–1994, when her party was in opposition, she continued to hold that office until she resigned in 2000 over a controversy in which she was criticised, as a private individual, for trying to convert her tenancy into a condominium, circumventing a controversial housing tenure law that she was responsible for introducing and advocating in her public role as Minister of Justice. Since this scandal, her relations with the press have been strained.

Following the assassination of Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh on 11 September 2003, Freivalds was asked to succeed her as Minister for Foreign Affairs.

== Events leading to the resignation in 2006 ==
Laila Freivalds was severely criticised in the Swedish press for the way the Swedish Government handled the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in Asia, and has admitted that her ministry &quot;Ought to have reacted much more strongly as early as Boxing Day instead of waiting for more information.&quot; In addition, she was heavily criticised for going to the theatre on 26 December 2004, the day of the tsunami disaster, and for stating that she does not listen to the news when she is not working.

On 21 March 2006, she resigned from her office as minister of foreign affairs, after it was confirmed that she lied to media about her involvement in the closing of a website belonging to the Sweden Democrats, in the wake of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. During the controversy the Sweden Democrats published a similar cartoon on their web pages, only to be shut down shortly after by their internet service provider. It was initially discovered that the government had been in contact with the provider and suggested to them the closure, but Freivalds maintained to the media that a subordinate had done so without her knowledge.

&quot;Offentlighetsprincipen&quot; (The Principle of Public Access) – a freedom of information provision enshrined in the Swedish constitution – made it possible to show that this was false. Since all documents in the Swedish state are in principle accessible to the public, internal documents in four places were found that made it clear that she had been fully informed of the event. This information was therefore published in &quot;Riksdag &amp; Department&quot;, an intra-governmental newspaper. The potential involvement in closing the website was seen by many as a violation against that part of the Swedish constitution dealing with freedom of the press.

Most journalists suggest that the turning point came after Göran Persson, the Prime Minister of Sweden during this time, publicly criticized the civil servant who suggested to the Internet host that they close the website, only to find out later that he had acted with the approval of Freivalds. It is theorised but not confirmed that the prime minister privately suggested that she resign, which she subsequently did.

Bo Ringholm was Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs until 27 March, when Jan Eliasson was appointed to the post.

<text>In vector calculus, a Laplacian vector field is a vector field which is both irrotational and incompressible. If the field is denoted as v, then it is described by the following differential equations:
:formula_1

== Laplace&#x27;s equation ==
From the vector calculus identity formula_2 it follows that
:formula_3

that is, that the field v satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation.

However, the converse is not true; not every vector field that satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation is a Laplacian vector field, which can be a point of confusion. For example, the vector field formula_4 satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation, but it has both nonzero divergence and nonzero curl and is not a Laplacian vector field.

== Cauchy-Riemann equations ==
A Laplacian vector field in the plane satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations: it is holomorphic.

== Potential of Laplacian field ==
Suppose the curl of formula_5 is zero, it follows that (when the domain of definition is simply connected) formula_5 can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential (see irrotational field) which we define as formula_7:
:formula_8
since it is always true that formula_9.

Other forms of formula_10 can be expressed as

formula_11.

When the field is incompressible, then

formula_12.

And substituting equation 1 into the equation above yields 
:formula_13

Therefore, the potential of a Laplacian field satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation.

== Potential flow theory ==
The Laplacian vector field has an impactful application in fluid dynamics. Consider the Laplacian vector field to be the velocity potential&quot; formula_7 &quot;which is both irrotational and incompressible.

Irrotational flow is a flow where the vorticity, formula_15, is zero, and since formula_16, it follows that the condition formula_17 is satisfied by defining a quantity called the velocity potential formula_7, such that formula_19, since formula_20 always holds true.

Irrotational flow is also called potential flow.

If the fluid is incompressible, then conservation of mass requires that 

formula_21.

And substituting the previous equation into the above equation yields formula_22 which satisfies the Laplace equation.

In planar flow, the stream function formula_23 can be defined with the following equations for incompressible planar flow in the xy-plane:

formula_24.

When we also take into consideration formula_25, we are looking at the Cauchy-Reimann equations.

These equations imply several characteristics of an incompressible planar potential flow. The lines of constant velocity potential are perpendicular to the streamlines (lines of constant formula_23) everywhere.

== Further reading ==
The Laplacian vector field theory is being used in research in mathematics and medicine. Math researchers study the boundary values for Laplacian vector fields and investigate an innovative approach where they assume the surface is fractal and then must utilize methods for calculating a well-defined integration over the boundary. Medical researchers proposed a method to obtain high resolution in vivo measurements of fascicle arrangements in skeletal muscle, where the Laplacian vector field behavior reflects observed characteristics of fascicle trajectories.

<doc id="461539" wikidata="Q1814208" url="?curid=461539" title="Metra">
<text>Metra is the primary commuter rail system in the Chicago metropolitan area serving the city of Chicago and its surrounding suburbs via the Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF Railway, and other railroads. The system operates 243 stations on 11 rail lines. It is the fourth busiest commuter rail system in the United States by ridership and the largest and busiest commuter rail system outside the New York City metropolitan area. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of . The estimated busiest day for Metra ridership occurred on November 4, 2016—the day of the Chicago Cubs 2016 World Series victory rally, with a record 460,000+ passengers.

Metra is the descendant of numerous passenger rail services dating to the 1850s. The present system dates to 1974, when the Illinois General Assembly established the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) to consolidate transit operations in the Chicago area, including commuter rail as a public utility. The RTA&#x27;s creation was a result of the anticipated withdrawal of commuter service operated and owned by various private railroad companies in the 1970s. In a 1983 reorganization, the RTA placed commuter rail under a newly formed Commuter Rail Division, which branded itself as Metra in 1985. Freight rail companies still operate four of Metra&#x27;s routes under purchase-of-service agreements. Metra owns all rolling stock and is responsible for all stations along with the respective municipalities. Since its inception, Metra has directed more than $5 billion into the commuter rail system of the Chicago metropolitan area alongside the CTA. In January 2023, Metra rolled out a new real-time train tracking website to allow passengers greater visibility into their commute.

== History ==
=== Early Chicago commuter rail ===
Since the 19th century, Chicago has been a major hub in the North American rail network. It has more trackage radiating in more directions than any other city in North America. Railroads set up their headquarters in the city and Chicago became a center for building freight cars, passenger cars and diesel locomotives. Early commuter services were run by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, Chicago and North Western, and Milwaukee Road.

By the 1930s, Chicago had the world&#x27;s largest public transportation system, but commuter rail services started to decline. By the mid-1970s, the commuter lines faced an uncertain future. The Burlington Northern, Milwaukee Road, Chicago and North Western and Illinois Central had been losing money for several years, and were using trainsets with passenger cars dating as far back as the 1920s.

=== Formation of the RTA ===

To provide stability to the commuter rail system, the Illinois General Assembly formed the Regional Transportation Authority in 1974. Its purpose was to fund and plan the Chicago region&#x27;s public transportation. After initially using second-hand equipment, the RTA took delivery of the first new EMD F40PH locomotives in 1976. That F40PH fleet is still in service today. The companies that had long provided commuter rail in the Chicago area continued to operate their lines under contract to the RTA.

Less than a decade later the RTA was already suffering from ongoing financial problems. Additionally, two rail providers, the Rock Island Line and the Milwaukee Road, went bankrupt, forcing the RTA to create the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation to operate their lines directly in 1982. In 1983 the Illinois Legislature reorganized the agency. That reorganization left the Regional Transportation Authority in charge of day-to-day operations of all bus, heavy rail and commuter rail services throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. It was also responsible for directing fare and service levels, setting up budgets, finding sources for capital investment and planning. A new Commuter Rail Division was created to handle commuter rail operations; along with CTA and Pace, it was one of RTA&#x27;s three &quot;service boards&quot;.

=== Metra branding ===

The board of the RTA Commuter Rail Division first met in 1984. In an effort to simplify the operation of commuter rail in the Chicago area, in July 1985 it adopted a unified brand for the entire system–Metra, or Metropolitan Rail. The newly reorganized Metra service helped to bring a single identity to the many infrastructure components serviced by the Regional Transportation Authority&#x27;s commuter rail system. However, the system is still legally known as the Commuter Rail Division of the RTA.

Today, Metra&#x27;s operating arm, the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation, operates seven Metra owned routes. Four other routes continue to be operated by Union Pacific (formerly Chicago &amp; North Western) and BNSF (formerly Burlington Northern) under contract to Metra. Service throughout the network is provided under the Metra name (in keeping with Metra&#x27;s goal of providing a single identity for all commuter rail in the region). Metra also owns all rolling stock, controls fares and staffing levels, and is responsible for most of the stations. However, the freight carriers who operate routes under contract use their own employees and control the right-of-way for those routes.

By the first quarter of 2024, the Union Pacific Railroad is expected to transfer operations of the three Union Pacific lines to Metra. Union Pacific will continue to own and maintain the right-of-way.

=== Growth and expansion ===
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Metra experienced record ridership and expanded its services. In 1996, Metra organized its first new line, the North Central Service, running from Union Station to Antioch. By 2006, it added new intermediate stops to that same route, extended the Union Pacific West Line from Geneva to Elburn and extended SouthWest Service from Orland Park to Manhattan. In 2012, it boasted 95.8% average on-time performance (measured only for a train&#x27;s arrivals at its last station no more than six minutes late). It also posted its fourth highest volume in its history despite decreases in employment opportunities in downtown Chicago.

Metra continued to seek expansion options and to improve passenger service. Over the past three decades, Metra has invested more than $5 billion into its infrastructure. That investment has been used to purchase new rolling stock, build new stations, renovate tracks, modernize signal systems and upgrade support facilities. In addition to core improvements on the Union Pacific Northwest and Union Pacific West Lines, planning advanced on two new Metra routes, SouthEast Service and the Suburban Transit Access Route (&quot;STAR&quot; Line). In 2023, Metra announced plans to extend the Milwaukee District West Line to Rockford, Illinois, with intermediate stops at Huntley and Belvidere, by 2027. In August 2024, Metra ran hourly shuttles on the North Central Service between O&#x27;Hare International Airport and Union Station during the Democratic National Convention, leading some to question whether more frequent service to O&#x27;Hare could be permanently obtained. Such an agreement would require contracts with the two freight railroads - Canadian National, which owns some of the NCS track, and CPKC, which dispatches trains on another portion of the route. Additionally, improved service to O&#x27;Hare would likely require major infrastructure upgrades to track, sidings, crossovers, and flyovers, with the potential for dedicated rolling stock another consideration.

=== Corruption ===
Metra also has been marred by allegations and investigations of corruption. In April 2002, board member Don Udstuen resigned from both Metra and his executive job with the Illinois State Medical Society, after admitting to taking bribes to steer Metra contracts to firms associated with former legislator Roger Stanley and pleading guilty to his part in Illinois&#x27;s Operation Safe Road scandal.

In April 2010, Metra&#x27;s executive director, Phil Pagano, faced investigation for taking an unauthorized $56,000 bonus and was later found to have improperly received $475,000 in vacation pay. The day that the agency&#x27;s board was scheduled to discuss his fate, Pagano stepped in front of a moving Metra train in an apparent suicide. Around the time of Pagano&#x27;s death, allegations also surfaced that a Metra employee demanded a $2,000 payoff from the studio that used Metra in the 2011 film &quot;Source Code&quot;. That employee was later relieved of his duties, and retired.

In June 2013, Metra CEO Alex Clifford abruptly resigned his position with no public comment. It was later reported that his exit had been demanded by the Metra board, which negotiated a $871,000 severance package including a non-disclosure agreement. Clifford&#x27;s ouster was allegedly arranged because he rejected requests for patronage hiring and promotion, including a request to promote a longtime supporter of State Representative Michael Madigan. In the wake of this scandal, five board members resigned. In August 2013, the remaining board members unanimously elected Don Orseno as interim CEO. (The six-member board was operating with reduced membership and thus lacked the authority to elect a permanent CEO. Orseno and Alex Wiggins shared duties as co-executive directors.) Orseno&#x27;s long railroad career, beginning with work to set up trains and check doors for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad played favorably in the board&#x27;s decision. By October 2013, local officials had restored Metra&#x27;s board to 11 members. After reviewing four candidates, the re-constituted board formally appointed Orseno CEO of Metra in January 2014.
In 2014, &quot;a lengthy history of political patronage hiring at&quot; Metra was reported, based on past files.

=== Underfunding ===
For a long time, Metra was not being funded enough to keep most equipment and rolling stock up to date. On average, the agency received approximately $700 million a year, but Metra claims to need about $2 billion a year, which only since 2020 has been accomplished. Because of this, Metra had to cut back on new rolling stock, instead resorting to their Rebuild Programs, in which they rebuild railcars and locomotives with newer state of the art utilities. Rebuilds cost only a fraction as much as buying new rolling stock, such as with their Amerail built cars. Rebuild programs can rebuild aging cars for approximately $650,000, whereas buying that same railcar new would be approximately $3 million.

== Operations ==
=== Stations ===

Metra serves passengers through stations throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. Each station, unless a route or branch terminus, provides travel toward (inbound) and away from (outbound) downtown Chicago. Therefore, a passenger can connect between the city and a suburb or between two points in the suburbs using Metra service. Although Metra&#x27;s commuter rail system is designed to connect points all over the Chicago metropolitan area, it does provide some intracity connections within Chicago.

Metra trains originate from one of four stations in downtown Chicago. Six lines originate at Union Station. The three Union Pacific lines originate at Ogilvie Transportation Center, formerly and still popularly called North Western Station. The Rock Island District originates at LaSalle Street Station. The Metra Electric District originates at Millennium Station, formerly and still often called Randolph Street Terminal. All four terminals are situated within walking distance of the Chicago Loop, so Metra passengers can easily transfer to a different Metra line upon their arrival downtown. Metra&#x27;s urban-centric service remains popular with suburban commuters working downtown, reverse commuters, and those who visit Chicago for recreational activities and tourism.

Stations are found throughout Chicago, as well as in suburban Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties—an area largely coextensive with the inner ring of the Chicago metropolitan area. One station is located in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

=== Routes ===

Metra operates on 11 lines, most of which date from the mid-19th century. Four lines are operated under purchase-of-service agreements. The BNSF Line service is operated by BNSF Railway. The three lines out of the Ogilvie Transportation Center (formerly North Western Station) are operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The other seven lines are operated by the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Rail Corporation (NIRC), Metra&#x27;s operating subsidiary; five of these primarily run over track owned by other railroads, while two (the Electric and Rock Island districts) run entirely on Metra-owned track. Inbound trains on every line at all times run through to their Chicago terminus, however, many outbound trains do not run through to their respective lines&#x27; terminus (for example, most trains on the Union Pacific Northwest Line do not run through to Harvard; instead, terminating at Crystal Lake).

:The Union Pacific West Line is a route running from Ogilvie Transportation Center to , Illinois. The line had an average of 27,900 weekday passenger trips in 2018–2019.

==== Proposed routes ====
Metra proposed two routes in the early 2000s: the SouthEast Service, which would connect some portions of the southern suburbs with downtown Chicago; and the Suburban Transit Access Route, which would connect various suburbs with each other without going into downtown. , only the SouthEast Service is still being considered.

In 2023, the Illinois Department of Transportation selected Metra as the agency to run restored rail service to Rockford.

==== Pre-Metra routes ====
Several commuter lines were discontinued before Metra was established. The Illinois Central West Line from present-day Millennium Station to Addison, Illinois, (closed 1931), Pennsylvania Railroad line to Valparaiso, Indiana, (closed 1935), New York Central line from LaSalle Street Station to Elkhart, Indiana, (closed 1964), and four Chicago &amp; North Western lines to St. Charles, Aurora, Freeport, and Kenosha-Harvard (all municipalities in Illinois and Wisconsin, closed 1930–51). The Burlington Route had service between Aurora and West Chicago, Illinois (closed 1943). Chicago Eastern Illinois operated commuter service on this line out of Dearborn Station to Dolton and Momence, respectively. The Chicago and Eastern Illinois commuter line to Momence, Illinois, ended in 1935, while the Chicago and Western Indiana service to Dolton, Illinois, was discontinued in 1964. Chicago Great Western had commuter service to DeKalb, Illinois (closed 1906). Santa Fe service to Joliet, Illinois (closed 1903). However, Metra runs service to Joliet, Illinois, on two routes: Heritage Corridor and Rock Island District.

=== Ridership ===
Ridership has been slowly declining on all but one line since 2014, as seen below. The figures post-2020 have been drastically affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Though monthly reports from 2024 show heavy improvement over 2021 figures, they are still below pre-pandemic levels. Peak-direction ridership is at only 56% of pre-pandemic ridership, while other types of weekday travel are between 80% and 95% recovery rates. Systemwide, Saturday and Sunday ridership has fully recovered to pre-pandemic numbers.

=== Connections ===
Transportation in Chicago consists of a public transportation infrastructure allowing for intermodal connections to local, regional, national and international transportation services. Parking lots are available adjacent to most suburban Metra stations for passengers connecting with their train by car. Most parking lots are operated by the municipality they are located in. Fees and fines are also assessed by the local municipality; however, parking is usually free on weekends and most holidays. Mass transit CTA and suburban Pace buses connect with many Metra stations downtown and in the suburbs. Monthly pass holders are offered link-up options with these services. In addition, many intercity bus lines connect with passengers outside of Union Station.

The Chicago &quot;L&quot; also has transfers with Metra at some Chicago stations. Most &#x27;L&#x27; lines traverse the Loop allowing nearby access to all downtown Metra terminals. There are also transfer points between Metra and the &#x27;L&#x27; outside of the Loop, such as transfers from the Union Pacific Northwest Line to the Blue Line at Irving Park and Jefferson Park Transit Center; and from the Union Pacific West Line to the Green Line at Oak Park. &#x27;L&#x27; trains announce downtown Metra connections on board when announcing the next &#x27;L&#x27; stop.

Union Station doubles as both a Metra station and Amtrak&#x27;s station in Chicago. In addition to &quot;Illinois Service&quot; and &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, Amtrak trains run nationwide including service to states spanning both coastlines. Passengers connecting from Ogilvie Transportation Center can access Union Station through its north platforms on the opposite side of Madison Street, with Millennium and LaSalle stations also within a short walking distance of Union Station as well. A number of suburban Metra stations are also shared with Amtrak as well.

The South Shore Line, an interurban line connecting Chicago with the Indiana suburbs and South Bend, originates at Millennium Station and operates along much of the Chicago portion of the Electric District line, as far south as 63rd Street. Per a longstanding noncompete agreement, eastbound South Shore trains only stop at shared Electric District stations to board passengers, and westbound South Shore trains only stop to discharge passengers.

=== Positive train control ===
In regards to the PTC mandate that passed Congress, Metra took steps to meet the deadline. Metra concluded that the December 31, 2015, mandate to have PTC running was an unreasonable requirement. This aligned with the stance taken by much of the railroad industry. This is due to a variety of factors including but not limited to: delays from the government, and the fundamental complexity of building a program from the ground up. Moreover, Metra estimates the cost of implementing the system on their of track in the Chicago region to be over $200 million. The fear is this unfunded mandate will divert scarce capital funds from other essential needs. This includes building and maintaining existing tracks, stations, signals, and other equipment that ensures a safe operating environment for all of Metra&#x27;s passengers. However, Metra recognizes the need for PTC but needed a more reasonable timeline to implement such a program. This recognition is partially based on Metra&#x27;s previous accident history. Two noteworthy events were a pair of accidents on the Rock Island District within a span of a couple of years. The first event was a derailment that occurred on October 12, 2003, when a train flew through a 10 mph crossing at 68 mph. A second very similar occurrence happened on September 17, 2005, but was more serious. The latter derailment killed two passengers and injured 117. Both of these incidents could have been prevented if PTC were in place. In both circumstances, PTC would have overridden the engineer and slowed the train down to the appropriate speed to prevent an accident from occurring.

Recently, Metra has taken significant steps in the process to fully implementing PTC. On April 22, 2015, the Metra board approved an $80 million contract to Parsons Transportation Group. Parsons was the sole bidder and speaks to the complexities of the project. They will be in charge of incorporating various devices from GPS, radio, to trackside antennas into one cohesive system. The group has some experience in this sector previously as Parsons worked with the southern California commuter rail agency Metrolink to install their system.

By the year 2020, Metra completed installation of the Positive Train Control. This came at a capital cost of $400 million and an annual operating cost of $20 million. Metra&#x27;s PTC system works with the trains of 12 other railroad companies.

== Fare system and ticketing ==

Fare is determined by the distance traveled by a passenger. Each station along every route has generally been placed in a specific zone based on its distance from its respective downtown station. Multiple stations can be placed in the same zone even though they are on the same line.

Historically, the downtown terminals and stations in the vicinity of downtown were classified as zone &#x27;A&#x27; and each additional zone represented an added from the downtown terminus. There were originally thirteen fare zones: zones A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and M (zone L would not have any stations since 1984 when Hartland station closed on the Northwest Line). Zones K and M were merged into zone J on July 15, 2018, reducing the number of zones to ten.

On February 1, 2024, Metra reduced the number of fare zones from 10 to 4 and labeled each of the four zones by number instead of letter. This was proposed in an effort to simplify its fare structure. In addition, trips not entering or exiting the downtown area (zone 1) are subjected to a flat $3.75 fee.

=== Tickets ===
Several ticketing options exist for passengers. Riders may choose to purchase one-way tickets, day passes, day pass five-packs, weekend passes, or monthly passes.

* A one-way ticket is used for one-way travel between two stations. One-way tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines at stations, from the Ventra app, or on the train from a conductor. Conductors will charge an extra $5 if a ticket machine was available at the passenger&#x27;s departing station.
* A day pass provides unlimited rides on one calendar day for all stations in between two zones for twice the cost of a one-way ticket between those two zones. Day passes can be purchased in stations or in the Ventra app but are not for sale on board trains.
* A day pass five-pack provides five day passes between two zones determined at the time of purchase. Day pass five-packs can be shared between passengers and expire 90 days after the date of purchase. Day pass five-packs can only be purchased with the Ventra app.
* A Saturday or Sunday day pass provides unlimited travel between any and all zones for one passenger on a Saturday, Sunday, or certain holidays. Weekend day passes can be purchased in stations, on board trains (with no surcharge), or with the Ventra app. As of 2024, Saturday or Sunday weekend passes cost $7.
* A weekend pass (Ventra app only) provides unlimited travel between any and all zones for one passenger on a Saturday and Sunday. In the past, weekend passes were extended to include holidays adjacent to the weekend, but this practice seems to have ended. Weekend passes are only available within the Ventra app. As of 2024, weekend passes cost $10.
* A monthly pass provides unlimited travel between any two zones for one passenger on every day of a respective month. Monthly passes can be used on any line within the specified zones. Monthly passes can be purchased from ticket vending machines, or from the Ventra app. Starting in July 2022, PlusBus and Link-Up have been combined to form the new Regional Connect Pass. The Regional Connect Pass is available for $30 to monthly pass holders and allows for unlimited travel on CTA buses and the &#x27;L&#x27;, as well as Pace buses. The Regional Connect Pass is only available for monthly passes purchased in the Ventra app.

=== Reduced fare programs ===
Metra allows some travelers to purchase reduced fare tickets or even ride for free. These reduced fare and free ride programs are administered by Metra and the RTA. Some pre-college students, youth, senior citizens, members of the United States Armed Forces and persons with disabilities may qualify for these programs. Time-based and geographical restrictions apply to these programs and passengers must ensure they qualify before attempting to purchase special tickets or ride for free. Cook County launched The Fair Transit pilot on January 4, 2021, scheduled to initially last for three years. Under the pilot, all riders on the Metra Electric and Rock Island lines will pay Metra&#x27;s reduced fare rates.

On the Union Pacific North Line, passengers headed to an event at may ride to the event for free after showing their Ravinia Festival e-ticket to the conductor.

== Safety and security ==
Metra employees, the Metra Police Department and other public safety agencies are responsible for maintaining safety and security on its lines, aboard its trains and at stations all to various degrees. Although rail transport is one of the safest forms of land travel, compromises to Metra&#x27;s safety and security can occur through pedestrian accidents, suicide attempts, vehicle collisions, derailment, terrorism and other incidents. Failing to maintain safety and security can result in equipment and infrastructure damage, extensive service disruptions, traumatic injuries and loss of life. Therefore, Metra and other agencies consider safety a top priority and dedicate a significant amount of resources to combat these dangers.

Starting in the early summer of 2013, Metra has announced plans to up police patrols on to the seven lines the agency operates: the Milwaukee Districts North and West, the North Central Service, the Heritage Corridor, South West Service, Rock Island, and Electric District. The police patrols will not be on the BNSF and Union Pacific train lines because those lines are operated by the railroads that own them and security falls to those companies. When asked why there were increasing patrols spokesman Michael Gillis said, &quot;There is no particular reason, other than the fact that we want to be more proactive and more deliberately visible to our riders&quot;.

=== Law enforcement ===
The Metra Police Department is a special law enforcement agency charged with providing police services to passengers, employees, equipment and property. The department has more than 100 police officers and is responsible for the safety of all routes and stations. In an effort to help coordinate emergency preparedness and incident management, all Metra police officers are certified in the National Incident Management System. In addition, Metra police works with the Chicago Police Department as a member of the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy. Thomas A. Cook was the only Metra police officer that has been killed in the line of duty thus far.

=== Rail safety ===
The focus on rail safety by Metra comes from many fronts beyond operations including emergency preparedness and public awareness. The setup of railway platforms, use of grade crossing signals and horn blasts make up a critical system used to communicate movements of commuter trains to pedestrians and vehicles. Outside of these operational components, Metra aggressively pursues safety through public awareness. Metra utilizes its own Operation Lifesaver program and uses it to help spread safety messages. Metra also holds events promoting rail safety at schools and organizes a safety poster contest awarding winners with prizes and features their posters on monthly passes and at stations.

Metra has been honored with several E. H. Harriman Awards for employee safety, most recently with a Bronze award in class B (line-haul railroads with between 4 and 15 million employee hours per year) for 2005. Previous Harriman Awards conferred to Metra include Gold awards for 2003 and 2004 and a Silver award for 2002.

Metra expects to implement positive train control on its entire system in 2019, four years after the federally mandated 2015 deadline.

=== Incidents ===

There were 156 non-employee fatalities involving Metra equipment and Metra owned track between 2001 and 2010. On average 15 people were killed annually based on data from that decade. The highest number of fatalities in a year throughout that time occurred in 2002, with 23 deaths and in 2010, with 21 deaths. The majority of these fatalities occurred at grade crossings and on railway involving an impact with a train; only four deaths involved passengers aboard the train.

The worst commuter rail disaster in Illinois occurred before the formation of Regional Transportation Authority. The 1972 Chicago commuter rail crash consisted of a two-train collision on the Metra Electric, then under the control of the Illinois Central. The collision resulted in 45 deaths and 332 injuries. Two decades later, Metra experienced its first rail disaster, the 1995 Fox River Grove bus–train collision. This accident involved a collision of a Union Pacific Northwest Line train and a school bus at a grade crossing resulting in 21 injuries and the deaths of seven high school students. In 2003, another incident involved a Rock Island District train derailing while switching from one track to another, injuring 45 passengers. In 2005, a train carrying 200 passengers along the same stretch of track derailed and then collided with a steel bridge resulting in two deaths and 117 injured. The cause of both accidents was ruled to be human error; the trains were going at speeds in excess of when they should have been going .

On May 11, 2022, Metra train #1242 collided with a box truck at on the Metra BNSF Line, resulting in four injuries, and one death. The passenger who was killed, a 72-year-old woman from Downers Grove, was ejected from a window of the train during the collision. This incident, as of May 2022, is the second incident in Metra&#x27;s history that resulted in a passenger fatality.

In addition to the loss of life, injuries, damage and service disruptions caused by accidents, Metra and other transportation agencies have been involved in multimillion-dollar lawsuits and settlements stemming from safety failures. These failures have also resulted in updated safety policies and adjustments of equipment and warning devices.

<text>Beaver Island is an island in Lake Michigan in the U.S. state of Michigan. At , it is the largest island in Lake Michigan and the third largest island in Michigan after Isle Royale and Drummond Island. The island is located approximately from the city of Charlevoix. Beaver Island had a total population of 616 at the 2020 census. Beaver Island is part of Charlevoix County.

From 1848 to 1856, Beaver Island was home to a uniquely American political and religious experiment, a Mormon theocracy and monarchy ruled by King James Strang, who unsuccessfully challenged Brigham Young for the post-Joseph Smith leadership of Mormonism. Despite failing to gain a majority following, Strang remained the self-appointed leader of a Mormon splinter group, who were known colloquially as the Strangites to distinguish them from the much larger and mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After Strang&#x27;s assassination that year, dispossessed Irish American fishermen from the County Donegal Gaeltacht returned, expelled the Strangites, and retook the island, which is now a popular vacation and tourist destination. Portions of the island and surrounding archipelago are protected as part of the Beaver Islands State Wildlife Research Area.

== History ==
===Prehistory===
Ancient Stone Circles

Beaver Island was called &quot;&quot; by the Ojibwe, meaning &quot;where the beavers live&quot;.

There are at least two stone circle sites located on Beaver Island. The main site, Beaver Island Sun Circle (site no: 20CX65) (aka Beaver Island Stone Circle, or Beaver Island Stonehenge), is an unusually symmetrical 397-foot diameter stone circle consisting of approximately 39 (up to 150) stones and boulders of various sizes, from 2 feet to 10 feet with a ground height of 6 inches to 4 feet, with some stones presenting the appearance of hand-carved symbols and incised lines, hieroglyphs or pictographs including: geometric shapes, Algonquian thunderbirds, bulls, feathers, human faces/heads, human figures, and early Celtic writing. An example of these face/head markings, the Carved Face Rock, is on display at the Mormon Print Shop Museum. The site is located on the northwestern side of the island bisected by Mrs Reddings Trail, south of Angeline&#x27;s Bluff Lookout, near Peshawbestown, a historic Native American village. It is considered a sacred site by the Anishinaabemowin and Anishinaabe culture, as explained in 1990 by Frank Ettawageshik, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBBOI) Tribal Chairman.

The site was discovered in 1985 by Dr. Terri Bussey, of the Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council, who would spend 32 summers researching and documenting the site. It was further investigated in 1988 at Bussey&#x27;s request by Dr. Donald P. Heldman, Mackinac Island State Park Commission archaeologist, and Dr. Elizabeth B. Garland, Western Michigan University Anthropology professor. The stone circle construction date has been estimated to be approximately 1,000 years ago, possibly produced by the Mississippian people, and was possibly used by the Odawa Indigenous peoples as a solar and lunar medicine wheel calendar or for navigation. The site is astronomically aligned with the midsummer solstice, the center stone positioned under the North Star, and appears to chart constellations like the Big Dipper.

The validity of the site has been scrutinized and disputed since its discovery as being a misinterpreted common geological phenomenon, such as a random scattering of rocks or glacial deposits by other archeologists like Dr. Charles Cleland, Michigan State University Anthropology professor, and Dr. Christian Feest, Austrian ethnologist and ethnohistorian that specializes in the Native Americans of Eastern North America and the Northeastern United States. The site has been protected/owned since 1988 by the LTBBOI (Public Law: 103-324), and interpreted by the Amik Circle Society, a 501(c)3 organization (EIN: 81-3233690) originally formed in the 1990s and dedicated to understanding and protecting &quot;the many stone circles, mounds and burial sites found in the Islands.&quot;

The island&#x27;s second site discovered by M. T. Bussey in 2014, Fairy Stone Circle, is located on the northeastern side of the island bisected by East Side Drive, north of Mike Boyles Beach Road, and shows similar astronomical alignments as the Beaver Island Sun Circle.

===Pre-Colonial History===
The Odawa, who speak a dialect of the Ojibwe language, lived on Beaver Island for at least 300 years prior to its settlement by more recent immigrants. The region of Lake Michigan that surrounds Beaver Island has an unenviable reputation in the long history of shipwrecks on the Great Lakes, and a wreck within swimming distance of the island itself has been proposed as the possible last resting place of La Salle&#x27;s missing 1679 flagship &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, which is widely considered the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; among Great Lakes shipwreck hunters.

The Odawa population on Beaver Island was so large that a fur trading post was established there in the late 1830s. Despite Federal legislation criminalizing the sale of alcohol to Native Americans, the former location of the trading post is still known, revealingly, as &quot;Whiskey Point&quot;.

=== The Mormon Kingdom ===
Although Beaver Island is known today mostly for its beaches, forests, recreational harbor and seclusion, previously it was the site of a unique Latter Day Saint kingdom.

The island&#x27;s association with Mormonism began with the death of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Most Latter Day Saints considered Brigham Young to be his successor, but many others followed James J. Strang, who argued his own claim using a letter that he said Smith had written and mailed to him. Strang founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), claiming it was the sole legitimate continuation of the church that Joseph Smith founded. His group initially settled in Voree, Wisconsin Territory, in 1844, and established a community there that persists today as an unincorporated community within the town of Burlington, Wisconsin. Seeking refuge from religious persecution, Strang and his followers moved from Voree to Beaver Island in 1848.

At the time, unlike the Danish-American settlement on nearby Garden Island, Beaver Island was inhabited by mostly Irish Catholic immigrants. In particular they came from an Ulster Irish-speaking island (off the coast of County Donegal) called Arranmore ().

The Strangites flourished under their Prophet&#x27;s rule and, due to the Island&#x27;s strategic location, they became both an economic and political power in the region at the expense of nearby Mackinac Island. The Strangites also founded the town of St. James, which was named in honor of Strang. They constructed a road denominated &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; into the interior of the island that remains one of its primary thoroughfares. The Strangites cleared land; constructed cabins, farms and other improvements; and attempted to establish themselves permanently on the island.

In fact, Strang became powerful enough to force the &quot;Gentiles&quot;, or non-Mormons, of Beaver Island to pay tithes to his church. &quot;Gentiles&quot; who refused were allegedly subjected to flogging or violently driven off their land claims. Nothing, however, would have been more infuriating to Irish Catholic immigrants, for whom the events of the Tithe War were still a recent memory, than having once more to pay tithes to a denomination other than their own.

Irish Americans on the island, who were not welcome in St. James, first moved to a new settlement around Cable Bay, on Beaver Island&#x27;s southern tip. The Ojibwe and Odawa population, on the other hand, fled to nearby Garden Island, where they sided invariably with the Strangites&#x27; enemies to the point that Strang later alleged that the Indians had been, &quot;armed and hunting me for my life.&quot;

After first decreeing eleven days before the election that, &quot;every Gentile family must come to the harbor and be baptized into the Church of Zion or leave the island within ten days&quot;, Strang was unanimously elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1853 and again in 1855. He founded the first newspaper in Northern Michigan, the &quot;Northern Islander&quot;. During his tenure in the State Legislature, he made the island the center of the new County of Manitou, which included the Beaver Islands, Fox Islands and North Manitou and South Manitou Islands, and set the county seat at St. James in Beaver Island. The State of Michigan, however, abolished Manitou County in 1895 (see below).

After meeting and falling in love with 17-year-old Elvira Field during a mission trip in 1849, Strang declared that God had commanded him to become a polygamist, contrary to his previous opposition to polygamy. After allegedly eloping with Strang, Miss Field became the second of an ultimate five wives, by whom Strang fathered a total of fourteen children.

James J. Strang proclaimed himself &quot;King of Heaven and Earth&quot;, and was crowned on 8 July 1850 inside a large log &quot;tabernacle&quot; that his adherents erected, in an elaborate coronation ceremony. On him was bestowed a crown that a witness described as &quot;a shiny metal ring with a cluster of glass stars in the front&quot;, a royal red robe, shield, breastplate, and wooden scepter.

Meanwhile, ships sailing near Beaver Island routinely, &quot;sailed into a crack in the Lake&quot;, even during the summer, when shipwrecks in the region were highly unusual. During Strang&#x27;s rule and for decades afterwards, allegations of Mormon acts of piracy, wrecking through the use of false light beacons and the cutting of anchor cables by Strangites on skiffs, the mass murder of male shipwreck survivors, and the subjecting of attractive female shipwreck survivors to forced marriage, continued to be commonly told by Beaver Island residents, as well as by Great Lakes sailors and fishermen.

In an interview with folklorist Ivan Walton, one old sailor later recalled, &quot;Old Strang was a bad one. One time there was a fine old schooner anchored down here in Sand Bay to wait out a blow. She was a fine old schooner and when it came dark, them Mormons came done on her and murdered the whole crew except the two daughters of the Captain who were making the trip with him. Strang sees them and has him put on his boat and struck for the harbor with them but on the way one of the girls jumps overboard and they think she was drowned and went on but she swam back to the schooner and got a hold of the bob stays and there she was a-hanging when two Irishmen seeing the schooner and thinking she might be in trouble, rowed out and found the girl almost exhausted. Well, she told them her story and they took her back with them. One of the men was married and his wife took care of her and the fellow who wasn&#x27;t married went to the nearest Mormon house and with two loaded pistols, stole a horse and rode as fast it could run right up Strang&#x27;s big palace and went in and made them all put their hands up except the girl, who he told to go out and get on the horse and as soon as she did he backed out still keeping their hands up. There was old Strang and his five wives and some others and he got out and on the horse and rode with the girl. He later married her.&quot;

According to Strang&#x27;s biographer Miles Harvey, there are numerous well-documented cases of groups of Strangites, who saw non-Mormons as the enemy, making marauding raids in settlements around the shores of Lake Michigan. Their acts included timber piracy, counterfeiting, home invasions, armed robbery, and horse theft in Koshkonong, Wisconsin, Perrysburg, Ohio, Woodstock, Illinois, and the theft of fishing equipment from the refugee fishermen in Mackinac Island. Furthermore, on July 13, 1853, Mormon fishermen from Beaver Island fought a pitched battle on Lake Michigan against fishermen from what is now Charlevoix, Michigan.

Strang, however, insisted through his newspaper that all of these charges were lies motivated by Anti-Mormonism.

Strang and his adherents often conflicted with their neighbors on the island and adjacent locales. While claiming dominion of only his church, Strang tended to exert authority over non-Strangites on the island also and was regularly accused of forcibly seizing their property and ordering physical assaults against them. Meanwhile, the island and surrounding County were ruled with Strang as the political boss, while the Strangites imposed both a monarchy and theocracy upon local government that violated both the American system of Republicanism and the separation of church and state. Even before the new County&#x27;s creation, Strang was powerful enough to order the Treasurer of Mackinac County to surrender one-tenth of Beaver Island&#x27;s tax revenue to his church.

Open hostility between the two groups frequently became violent, and a growing number of Irish-American refugees fled to Mackinac Island. Other Irish-Americans once assaulted Strangites at the post office and, in what is still called the &quot;Battle of Whiskey Point&quot;, Strang fired a cannon at a private army of Irish-American fishermen who had come to retake the island and expel the Strangite church.

Meanwhile, one former Strangite later recalled that more and more Mormon families were, &quot;leading a double life, seemingly good Mormons, but only waiting for the opportunity to get away&quot;. The beginning of the end came when Strang ordered all Mormon women to wear bloomers instead of dresses. When two Mormon women refused obedience, Strang punished them by having their husbands flogged, an act that was rendered less unpopular after one of them was discovered &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; while committing adultery. While recovering from their floggings, both outraged husbands vowed revenge against Strang. On June 16, 1856, the United States Navy gunboat entered the harbor of St. James and Strang was invited aboard. As Strang walked along the dock the two Mormon flogging victims followed by several other disaffected Strangites repeatedly shot the Mormon king from behind and pistol-whipped him as he lay dying. The shooters, Thomas Bedford and Alexander Wentworth, then boarded the gunboat, which refused to surrender them to the Mormon Sheriff and instead sailed away and disembarked both men in Mackinac Island. Mackinac&#x27;s own Sheriff Julius Granger, who also kept the Grove House, took both shooters into custody and lodged them at his boarding house. Bedford and Wentworth were briefly ‘tried,’ fined $1.25 each for the judges service and released to a cheering supportive, and sympathetic crowd. No one was ever convicted of Strang&#x27;s murder. Following the ‘trial’ the freed men departed Mackinac Island for Green Bay, Wisc.

After Strang died of his wounds on July 9, 1856, mobs of dispossessed Irish fishermen from Mackinac Island and St. Helena Island arrived and expelled the Strangites, who then numbered approximately 2,600, from their claims 
on Beaver Island.

The Strangite tabernacle and Strang&#x27;s royal palace no longer survive, neither does the Strangite regalia, but a printing shop that his disciples erected persists as the only Strangite-era building still existing on Beaver Island. The Mormon printing shop now houses a museum of local history. The Strangite church continues to exist, though not on Beaver Island, and numbers a maximum of 300 adherents.

According to Frederick Stonehouse, &quot;Whether Strang and his Mormons were guilty of the charges of piracy and murder their enemies levelled at them or not is unknown. In today&#x27;s more politically correct climate, the feeling is that the charges were trumped up by their enemies, who were jealous of the success of the &#x27;Saints&#x27;. As usual, the truth is likely somewhere between the two extremes. There is a persistent rumor of treasure on Beaver Island. As the old tale goes it is part of King Strang&#x27;s ill-gotten gains and is &#x27;buried&#x27; in Fox Lake in a large chest. Over the years, people have searched for it without result, but of course, if someone did find it, is it wise to announce it to the world or just keep mum?&quot;

===&quot;America&#x27;s Emerald Isle&quot;===
Irish Catholic fishermen from Gull Island, Mackinac Island and various port cities of mainland Michigan, and also emigrants from County Donegal, Ireland, rapidly replaced the Strangites in Beaver Island. Their community, which more immigration from the Gaeltacht increased, developed a unique identity that isolation from the mainland fostered. Catholic sermons and even quotidian conversations were in Ulster Irish for decades. By the middle of the 1880s the Island became the largest supplier of freshwater fish consumed in the US, yet overfishing and technological change ended this dominance by 1893.

After the expulsion of the Strangites, local government in Manitou County, which included Beaver Island, almost ceased. Court sessions and elections were rarely held, county offices were often left vacant, and the region acquired a reputation for lawlessness. Michigan Governor John J. Bagley affirmed this reputation in 1877 when he advocated for abolition of the county. A bill was introduced to this effect yet failed to be enacted. A second attempt in 1895 was more successful, and Beaver Island was incorporated into Charlevoix County while Fox and Manitou Islands were incorporated into Leelanau County.

The 24-room King Strang Hotel was built in 1901 by Capt. Manus Bonner. Originally named the Beaver Hotel by Bonner, in the 1930s the new owner, Everett Cole, renamed it the King Strang Hotel after James Jesse Strang, the Mormon leader of Beaver Island in the mid-19th century. The hotel was sold in March 1982, and was reopened as the King Strang Hotel Club, a private club where each member owns a share of stock in the club. The local club members consider it an escape and refuge from the Detroiters in the summer.

In addition to King Strang, the Island became the residence of two other locally famous persons. Father Peter Gallagher, a priest from 1865 to 1898, was a colorful and charismatic leader who dominated insular society. He once engaged one of his parishioners in a fistfight in the insular chapel. Feodor Protar, who arrived in 1893, was a member of the religious movement founded by Leo Tolstoy. He served as a local doctor and friend-to-all while living as a recluse in a cabin in the interior of the Island. Protar died in 1925 and left many admirers.

In 1938, John W. Green (1871–1963), a resident of Beaver Island, was recorded by folklorist and ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax singing traditional songs, which can be heard on the Library of Congress website.

Logging, which was always an important part of the insular economy, greatly increased with the formation of the Beaver Island Logging Company in 1901. Docks, housing, railroads and a mill impacted the local scenery, while fishing continued as the primary economic activity. The collapse of the Great Lakes fish population caused by the accidental introduction of the lamprey eel by deep sea ships during the 1940s and &#x27;50s also caused the exodus of most of the residents, until tourism in the 1970s renewed interest in the Island.

== Geography ==
The island is long, wide, and is part of Charlevoix County, Michigan. It is mostly flat and sandy, with large forested tracts. According to data of the US census, it has of land, and a permanent population of 657 as of 2010. The more densely populated part, which comprises a mere 6% of total insular land, is within Saint James Township on the northern part of the island. The census of 2010 reported its population as 365. St. James Township also includes Garden Island, High Island, Hog Island and several minor islands in Lake Michigan, which are all permanently uninhabited. Peaine Township, which comprises the remaining 94% of insular land, contains large parcels of state land which are managed as part of the Beaver Islands State Wildlife Research Area. The research area is mostly undeveloped, with some relictual homesteads within the township that were constructed in the clearings of successful farms of the nineteenth century. In 2010 the township had a population of 292.

The island has several small to moderately sized lakes, including Lake Geneserath in the southeast, Greenes Lake and Fox Lake in the central part, and Font Lake, Egg Lake, Round Lake and Barneys Lake in the northern part. There are only two named streams: Jordan River that flows into Sand Bay on the eastern part of the island and Iron Ore Creek that flows into Iron Ore Bay on the southern part.

===Climate===
The island is within a climatic region that has great seasonal differences in temperature, with warm to hot, and often humid, summers and cold, even severely cold, winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, it has a humid continental climate, which is abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climatic maps.

== Economy ==

Historically, the primary industries in the island are fishing, logging and farming. Presently the economy centers in governmental services, tourism and residential and cottage construction. Recreational opportunities abound in the insular harbor, beaches, inland lakes and the state forest that includes much of the island. A golf course, nature trails, restaurants, hotels, a marina and other amenities are available.

The island describes itself as &quot;America&#x27;s Emerald Isle&quot; in allusion to the Irish ancestry of many of its residents.

Central Michigan University owns and operates a research facility in the island, denominated the &quot;CMU Biological Station&quot;. The station hosts classes and workshops for students and researchers. CMU also owns a former Coast Guard Boathouse on Whiskey Point in the northern part of the island and part of Miller&#x27;s Marsh.

==Transportation==
Two small airlines serve the island: Island Airways and Fresh Air Aviation. Airplanes are twin-engine propeller airplanes for 6–10 passengers. The flight to the island takes approximately 20 minutes, are available multiple times a day throughout the year and reservations often are accepted with only brief notice. Luggage generally is included in the cost of a ticket, with a &quot;pounds per person&quot; limit, and additional luggage is charged according to its weight in pounds. Pets may be transported also, with prices of such tickets premised on the size of pets. Island Airways&#x27; airplanes depart from Charlevoix to Welke Airport (6Y8), a privately owned yet publicly accessible airport in Peaine Township that is approximately one mile (1,600 meters) south of St. James. Fresh Air Aviation&#x27;s airplanes depart from Charlevoix to the public Beaver Island Airport (KSJX), which is on the Western side, a little over from St. James.
Beaver Island Boat Company operates a scheduled automobile ferry service from Charlevoix during most of the year. Daily service is available from May through September, and a more limited service is available from October through mid-December. The ferry runs on a seasonal schedule where the number of daily trips ranges from one to four trips departing from Charlevoix to the island. The ferry is closed from January through March. Travelers are advised to verify the weather before boarding because rough waves can cause sea sickness. Visitors wishing to transport their own motor vehicles must make reservations in advance as ferry space is limited. Two ferry boats are in service, &quot;The Emerald Isle&quot; and the &quot;Beaver Islander&quot;, the latter of which is smaller. The journey is slightly more than two hours to two and one-half hours, contingent on weather and which ferry is ridden. Dogs, bikes, canoes, kayaks, boats, and motorcycles can be transported aboard the ferry for a fee.

Two lighthouses are on the island:
*Beaver Island Harbor Light (St. James Light), erected in 1870, on the northern part of the Island, which continues to aid navigation.
*Beaver Island Head Lighthouse on the southern part of the Island, erected in 1858, was deactivated in 1961.

== Events ==

=== Dark Sky ===
On April 8, 2024, the Beaver Island State Wildlife Research Area International Dark Sky Sanctuary (locally known as &quot;the Sanctuary&quot;) was established, encompassing 9.425.5 acres of the island. The advocacy group, DarkSky International, gave the designation of sanctuary, stating the Sanctuary is one of &quot;the most remote (and often darkest) places in the world, whose conservation state is most fragile.&quot; Thus recognizing Beaver Island as one of the best places in the world to see the stars and a place actively working to preserve those conditions. In honor of Beaver Island being involved in the Dark Sky Project, Beaver Island Community Center creates events to bring the community together to view various phenomena such as constellations, meteor showers, and the Northern Lights.

<text>David B. Duncan (born 1960) is a former partner of Arthur Andersen, and was the United States government&#x27;s star witness in the Arthur Andersen trial. He has said fears over interpretation prompted him to order the shredding of documents relating to Enron.

Duncan grew up in Odessa, Texas, and graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 1980 with a degree in accounting. He began working at Arthur Andersen&#x27;s Houston office in 1981 and become a partner at the firm in 1995. In 1997, he was assigned as the lead partner on the Enron account and was paid over $1 million for his work. During this time, Duncan became a member of the 18-partner Andersen CEO Advisory Council and Andersen&#x27;s representative on the 36-member American Council for Capital Formation.

He was fired from Andersen in January 2002 and charged with obstruction of justice for ordering Andersen staff to shred over a ton of papers related to Enron. On April 9, 2002, he pleaded guilty; the maximum sentence for his crimes is ten years, but since he pleaded guilty and became a witness for the prosecution he would have presumably received a much smaller sentence. His sentencing date was postponed numerous times. He withdrew his guilty plea on December 12, 2005, after the overturning of the Arthur Andersen conviction. This was approved by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon. In January 2008 he settled charges with the SEC that he violated securities laws. In November 2011, The Houston Chronicle/Fuelfix reported that Duncan was Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Houston-based U.S. Pipeline. He currently resides in Houston, Texas and has three daughters.

<text>HMS &quot;Chaser&quot; (D32/R306/A727) was an American-built that served with the Royal Navy during the Second World War.

Acquired by the United States Navy for conversion to a ; she was transferred to the Royal Navy and commissioned as &quot;Chaser&quot; on 9 April 1943, under the Lend-Lease agreement. She spent most of her career escorting convoys in Arctic, she transferred to the British Pacific Fleet in March 1945.

==Construction==
&quot;Chaser&quot; was laid down on 28 June 1941, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 162, by Ingalls Shipbuilding, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, as &quot;Mormacgulf&quot;. Her name was changed to &quot;Mormacdove&quot; on 5 December 1941. She was launched on 19 June 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Eugene T. Oates. After she was acquired by the US Navy, she was renamed &quot;Breton&quot; and designated AVG-10. On 20 August 1942, she was reclassified ACV-10. On 9 April, she was again reclassified, now CVE-10, and transferred to the Royal Navy under the Lend-Lease program and commissioned as HMS &quot;Chaser&quot;.

==Design and description==
There were eleven &quot;Attacker&quot;-class in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were built between 1941 and 1942, by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Ingalls Shipbuilding, and Western Pipe &amp; Steel shipyards in the United States.

The ship had complement of 646 men, who lived in crew accommodation that was significantly different from the arrangements that were normal for the Royal Navy at the time. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three-tier bunk-beds, 18 to a cabin, which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.

&quot;Chaser&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at full load. Power was provided by two boilers feeding steam to a turbine driving one shaft, giving , which could propel the ship at .

She had the operating capacity for up to 24 aircraft, which could be a mixture of anti-submarine and fighter aircraft; the British Hawker Sea Hurricane and Supermarine Seafire naval fighters, Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber or the American-supplied Grumman Martlet and Vought F4U Corsair fighters or Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber could be carried. The exact composition of the embarked squadrons depended upon the mission. Some squadrons were composite squadrons for convoy defence and would be equipped with both anti-submarine and fighter aircraft, while other squadrons working in a strike carrier role would only be equipped with fighter aircraft. Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the flight deck, two aircraft lifts , and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. When employed as an aircraft transport she could carry 90 aircraft.
The ships armament concentrated on anti-aircraft (AA) defence and consisted of eight Bofors guns in twin mounts and ten Oerlikon cannons in single and eight in twin mounts. In addition, she had two 4 inch (102 mm)/50 caliber Mk 9 guns.

&quot;Chaser&quot; was designed to accompany other ships forming the escort for convoys. The anti-submarine aircraft employed were initially the Fairey Swordfish and later the Grumman Avenger, which could be armed with torpedoes, depth charges, bombs or RP-3 rocket projectiles. As well as carrying out their own attacks on U-boats, these aircraft identified their locations for the convoy&#x27;s escorts to mount an attack. Typically anti-submarine patrols would be flown between dawn and dusk. One aircraft would fly about ahead of the convoy, while another patrolled astern. Patrols would last between two and three hours, using both radar and visual observation in their search for U-boats.

&quot;Chaser&quot; also had a secondary role, providing oil and provisions for her accompanying destroyers. This could be a lengthy process and was done on the move. It took 40 minutes from firing a line across to the destroyer to start pumping oil, while it took another two hours to pump 98 tons of oil and a further 35 minutes to disconnect the hose pipe and secure the equipment.

==Service history==
After workup in the Chesapeake Bay area, &quot;Chaser&quot; embarked 845 Squadron, which had been formed in the US, on 23 June 1943, for passage across the Atlantic. She crossed the Atlantic in company with Convoy HX 245, arriving at the Clyde on 6 July 1943.

On 7 July 1943, there was an explosion in &quot;Chaser&quot;″s boiler room. She was repaired at Rosyth Dockyard. On 29 October, with her repairs completed, she returned to the Clyde, where she was allocated to the Western Approaches Command. She embarked 835 Squadron equipped with Fairey Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes for workup. On 29 November, &quot;Chaser&quot; returned to the Clyde for further defect rectification. These repairs would continue for the remainder of the year. Upon the return to active duty she was attached to the Home Fleet for convoy duty on the Russian convoy route, embarking 816 Squadrons, equipped with Swordfish and Grumman Wildcats, and sailed for Scapa Flow.

===Arctic duty===
On 22 January 1944, &quot;Chaser&quot; joined Convoy JW 57, which had left Loch Ewe the previous day, for escort to the Kola Inlet. She was the first escort carrier assigned to provide protection for large convoys as they steamed to Russia. &quot;Chaser&quot;″s Wildcats helped to drive off German aircraft shadowing the convoy, while her Swordfish made several unsuccessful attacks against German submarines. On 24 February, one of &quot;Chaser&quot;″ Swordfishes spotted the submarine on the surface and called up the destroyer which sank the U-boat with depth charges. A second submarine was sunk by a shore based flying boat, while one escorting destroyer, was sunk by a U-boat. None of the 43 merchant ships comprising the convoy was hit by the 14 U-boats deployed in two patrol lines against the convoy.

&quot;Chaser&quot; joined the return convoy, RA 57 of 33 merchant ships, on 2 March. On 4 March, one of &quot;Chaser&quot;″s Swordfish caught on the surface. &quot;U-472&quot; was unable to defend itself as its anti-aircraft guns were iced up, and the Swordfish attacked with bombs and rockets, damaging the submarine, and then called up the destroyer which finished off the submarine with gunfire. The next day, a Swordfish from &quot;Chaser&quot; attacked and sunk with rockets, at in the Arctic, northwest of Hammerfest, Norway. On 6 March, radio signals from a submarine were detected by HF/DF and a Swordfish was sent to investigate. The Swordfish spotted the submarine and attacked with rockets, sinking at in the Norwegian Sea, northwest of Narvik, Norway. One merchant ship was sunk.

After returning to Loch Ewe on 10 March, &quot;Chaser&quot; dragged her anchor and ran aground on 13 March, being towed off the next day. She had her hull repaired and was refitted at Rosyth and was then modified for service as a ferry carrier with the Pacific Fleet at Belfast.

===Pacific duty===
On 14 February 1945, &quot;Chaser&quot; left Britain on the first part of the journey to join the British Pacific Fleet, arriving in Sydney in May 1945, where she was attached to the 30th Aircraft Carrier Squadron. She was designated as a replenishment carrier, tasked with ferrying replacement aircraft to the forward areas where they could be transferred to the operational carriers. &quot;Chaser&quot; ferried aircraft to support British Pacific fleet operations during the invasion of Okinawa and operations off Japan in July–August 1945. Owing to a shortage to dedicated tankers, &quot;Chaser&quot; was also used to refuel other ships.

Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, she transported Allied prisoners of war homeward.

==Decommissioning==
The escort carrier was returned to the United States Navy at Norfolk, Virginia on 12 May 1946, and the ship was struck from the US Navy list on 3 August 1946. She was sold to the Waterman Steamship Co. on 20 December 1946 and later resold to the Netherlands.

==Merchant service==
She was renamed &quot;Aagtekerk&quot; in civilian service and was later renamed &quot;E Yung&quot;. The ship foundered on 4 December 1972, and was salvaged and then scrapped in Taiwan.

<doc id="461554" wikidata="Q1523078" url="?curid=461554" title="Giclée">
<text>Giclée ( ) describes digital prints intended as fine art and produced by inkjet printers. The term is a neologism, ultimately derived from the French word &quot;gicleur,&quot; coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne. The name was originally applied to fine art prints created on a modified Iris printer in a process invented in the late 1980s. It has since been used widely to mean any fine-art printing, usually archival, printed by inkjet. It is often used by artists, galleries, and print shops for their high quality printing, but is also used generically for art printing of any quality.

== Origins ==

The word &quot;giclée&quot; was adopted by Jack Duganne around 1990. He was a printmaker working at Nash Editions. He wanted a name for the new type of prints they were producing on a modified Iris printer, a large-format, high-resolution industrial prepress proofing inkjet printer on which the paper receiving the ink is attached to a rotating drum. The printer was adapted for fine-art printing. Duganne wanted a word that would differentiate such prints from regular commercial Iris prints then used as proofs in the commercial printing industry.

=== Etymology ===
&quot;Giclée&quot; is based on the French word &quot;gicleur&quot;, the French technical term for a jet or a nozzle, and the associated verb &quot;gicler&quot; (to squirt out). &quot;Une giclée&quot; (noun) means a spurt of some liquid. The French verb form &quot;gicler&quot; means to spray, spout, or squirt. Duganne settled on the noun &quot;giclée&quot;.

== Current usage ==

In addition to its original association with Iris prints, the word &quot;giclée&quot; has come to be loosely associated with other types of inkjet printing including processes that use dyes or fade-resistant, archival inks (pigment-based), and archival substrates primarily produced on Canon, Epson, HP and other large-format printers. These printers use the CMYK  (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) color process as a base with additional color cartridges for smoother gradient transitions (such as light magenta, light cyan, light and very light gray), up to 12 different inks in top model printers (orange, green, violet (Epson); red, green, blue (HP); 11+ Chroma Optimizer [a clearcoat] (Canon)) to achieve larger color gamut. A wide variety of substrates on which an image can be printed with such inks are available, including various textures and finishes such as matte photo paper, watercolor paper, cotton canvas, pre-coated canvas, or textured vinyl.

== Applications ==
Artists generally use inkjet printing to make reproductions of their original two-dimensional artwork, photographs, or computer-generated art. Professionally produced inkjet prints are much more expensive on a per-print basis than the four-color offset lithography process traditionally used for such reproductions. A large-format inkjet print can cost more than ten times that of a four-color offset litho print of the same image in a run of 1,000, not including scanning and color correction. Four-color offset lithographic presses have the disadvantage of the full job having to be set up and produced all at once in a mass edition. With inkjet printing the artist does not have to pay for the expensive printing plate setup or the marketing and storage needed for large four-color offset print runs. This allows the artist to follow a just-in-time business model in which inkjet printing can be an economical option, since art can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used. As a result, numerous individual artists own and operate their own printers.

<doc id="461561" wikidata="Q301486" url="?curid=461561" title="Deep Throat (Watergate)">
<text>Deep Throat is the pseudonym given to the secret informant who provided information in 1972 to Bob Woodward, who shared it with Carl Bernstein. Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of U.S. president Richard Nixon&#x27;s administration in what came to be known as the Watergate scandal. In 2005, 31 years after Nixon&#x27;s resignation and 11 years after Nixon&#x27;s death, Mark Felt revealed through an attorney that he was Deep Throat. By then, Felt was suffering from dementia and had previously denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein then confirmed the attorney&#x27;s claim.

==Background==
Deep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles that introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, G. Gordon Liddy, Egil Krogh, White House Counsel Charles Colson, former United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, former White House Counsel John Dean, and presidential adviser John Ehrlichman. The film based on the book was released two years later; nominated for eight Academy Awards, it won four.

Howard Simons was the managing editor of the &quot;Post&quot; during Watergate. He dubbed the secret informant &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. For more than 30 years, Deep Throat&#x27;s identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation. Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it. J. Anthony Lukas speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book &quot;Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years&quot; (1976), based on three &quot;New York Times Sunday Magazine&quot; articles, but he was widely criticized. According to an article in &quot;Slate&quot; on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the &quot;intelligence community&quot; in a 1989 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview with Lukas.

On May 31, 2005, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O&#x27;Connor, an attorney acting on Felt&#x27;s behalf. Felt reportedly said, &quot;I&#x27;m the guy they used to call Deep Throat.&quot; After the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; story broke, Woodward, Bernstein, and Benjamin C. Bradlee, the &quot;Post&quot;″s executive editor during Watergate, confirmed Felt&#x27;s identity as Deep Throat. L. Patrick Gray, former acting Director of the FBI and Felt&#x27;s overseer, disputed Felt&#x27;s claim in his book &quot;In Nixon&#x27;s Web&quot;, co-written with his son Ed. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person to improve sales of the book and movie. Woodward and Bernstein, however, defended Felt&#x27;s claims and detailed their relationship with him in Woodward&#x27;s book &quot;The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate&#x27;s Deep Throat&quot;.

==Role in the Watergate scandal==

On June 17, 1972, police arrested five men inside the offices of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Complex in Washington, D.C. In their possession were $2,300 (equivalent to $ today), plastic gloves to hide fingerprints, burglary tools, a walkie-talkie and radio scanner capable of listening to police frequencies, cameras with 40 rolls of film, tear gas guns, multiple electronic devices which they intended to plant in the Democratic Committee offices, and notebooks containing the telephone number of White House official E. Howard Hunt. One of the men was James W. McCord Jr.; a former Central Intelligence Agency employee and a security man for Nixon&#x27;s Committee for the Re-Election of the President, later notoriously mocked with the acronym &quot;CREEP&quot;.

&quot;Washington Post&quot; reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward pursued the story for two years. The scandal eventually implicated many members of Nixon&#x27;s White House, culminating in Nixon becoming the first United States president to resign. Woodward and Bernstein wrote in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; that key information in their investigation had come from an anonymous informant whom they dubbed &quot;Deep Throat&quot;.

===Methods of communication===
Woodward, in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, first mentions &quot;Deep Throat&quot; on page 71. Earlier in the book, he reports calling &quot;an old friend and sometimes source who worked for the federal government and did not like to be called at his office&quot;. Later, he describes him as &quot;a source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP as well as at the White House&quot;. The book also calls him &quot;an incurable gossip&quot; and states &quot;in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch&quot;, and as a man &quot;whose fight had been worn out in too many battles&quot;.

Woodward claimed that he would signal to &quot;Deep Throat&quot; that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When &quot;Deep Throat&quot; wanted a meeting, he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward&#x27;s copy of &quot;The New York Times&quot;; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met &quot;on the bottom level of an underground garage just over the Key Bridge in Rosslyn&quot;, at 2:00 a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has a historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal. , the garage had not been demolished.

Many were skeptical of these cloak and dagger methods. Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein and found them to be factually impossible. He noted that Woodward&#x27;s apartment 617 at 1718 P Street, Northwest, in Washington faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Havill said that anyone regularly checking the balcony, as &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was said to have done daily, would have been spotted. Havill also said that copies of &quot;The New York Times&quot; were not delivered to individual apartments but delivered in an unaddressed stack to the building&#x27;s reception desk. There would have been no way to know which copy was intended for Woodward. Woodward, however, has stated that in the early 1970s the interior courtyard was an alleyway and had not yet been bricked off and that his balcony was visible from street level to passing pedestrians. It was also visible, Woodward conjectured, to anyone from the FBI in surveillance of nearby embassies. Also revealed was the fact that Woodward&#x27;s copy of &quot;The New York Times&quot; had his apartment number indicated on it. Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg stated that Woodward would sometimes come to his door looking for his marked copy of the &quot;Times&quot;, claiming, &quot;I like to have it in mint condition and I like to have my own copy.&quot;

Further, while Woodward stressed these precautions in his book, he also admits to having called &quot;Deep Throat&quot; on the telephone at his home. Felt&#x27;s wife recalls answering Woodward&#x27;s telephone calls for Felt.

===Controversy over motives===
In public statements following the disclosure of his identity, Felt&#x27;s family called him an &quot;American hero&quot;, stating that he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for moral and patriotic reasons. Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward.

In his book &quot;The Secret Man&quot;, Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist to and admirer of J. Edgar Hoover. After Hoover&#x27;s death, Felt became angry and disgusted when L. Patrick Gray, a career naval officer and lawyer from the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, had no law enforcement experience and was appointed as Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the FBI. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray&#x27;s management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover&#x27;s. Felt aided Woodward and Bernstein because he knew Woodward personally, having met him years before when Woodward was in the navy. Over the course of their acquaintance, Woodward would often call Felt for advice. Instead of seeking out prosecutors at the Justice Department, or the House Judiciary Committee charged with investigating presidential wrongdoing, Felt was methodically solicited by Woodward to guide their investigation while keeping his own identity and involvement safely concealed.

Some conservatives who worked for Nixon, such as Pat Buchanan and G. Gordon Liddy, castigated Felt and asserted their belief that Nixon was unfairly hounded from office, often claiming it a &quot;witch hunt&quot;.

== Speculation concerning Mark Felt ==
=== Speculation within the White House ===
Although Deep Throat&#x27;s identity was unconfirmed for over 30 years, there were suspicions that Felt was indeed the reporters&#x27; mysterious source long before the public acknowledgment in 2005. In 2012&#x27;s &quot;Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat&quot;, Max Holland reports that Felt leaked information to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. While the &quot;Post&quot; reporters did not reveal their source, &quot;Time&quot; correspondent Sandy Smith told &quot;Time&quot;″s lawyer, Roswell Gilpatric, a partner of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. Gilpatric then passed the information to Henry E. Petersen, the Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. In turn, Petersen revealed the information to White House Counsel John W. Dean, who finally reported it to President Richard Nixon.

Nixon did not publicly acknowledge learning Deep Throat&#x27;s identity. Nixon claimed that if he had done so, Felt would have publicly revealed information that would damage the FBI, as well as other powerful people and institutions. In the &quot;smoking gun&quot; tape, Nixon&#x27;s chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, stated that Felt &quot;knows everything there is to know in the FBI.&quot; Haldeman implied that Nixon&#x27;s motives for not outing Felt were not entirely altruistic, especially because Nixon himself may have been damaged by Felt&#x27;s revelations.

=== Speculation in the press and the public ===
It had previously been revealed publicly that Deep Throat was definitely a man. Using this and other widespread clues, real or perceived, some members of the press and the public came to suspect Felt of being Deep Throat. For instance, George V. Higgins wrote in 1975: &quot;Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a &quot;Washington Post&quot; alias borrowed from a dirty movie.&quot; However, Woodward and Bernstein were tight-lipped concerning their informant&#x27;s identity. Before Felt was revealed to be Deep Throat, only Woodward, Bernstein, Elsa Walsh and Ben Bradlee knew of his identity. Writer Nora Ephron became obsessed with figuring out the secret of Deep Throat&#x27;s identity and eventually correctly concluded that he was Mark Felt.

In 1999, a 19-year-old college student, Chase Culeman-Beckman, claimed that Bernstein&#x27;s son, Jacob, told him Mark Felt was Deep Throat. According to Culeman-Beckman, Jacob Bernstein had said that he was, &quot;100 percent sure that Deep Throat was Mark Felt. He&#x27;s someone in the FBI.&quot; Jacob reportedly made this claim approximately 11 years prior, when he and Culeman-Beckman were classmates. Ephron explained that Jacob overheard her &quot;speculations&quot;; Carl Bernstein himself also immediately stepped forward to reject the claim, as he and Woodward did for many others. James Mann, who had worked at the &quot;Post&quot; at the time of Watergate scandal and was close to the investigation, brought a great deal of evidence together in a 1992 article in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Mann recalled that before the Watergate scandal, Woodward had made references to a high-placed source he had in the FBI. Mann argued that the information that Deep Throat gave Woodward could only have come from FBI files. Felt was also embittered at having been passed over for director of the FBI and believed that the FBI, in general, was hostile to the Nixon administration. In previous unrelated articles, Woodward made clear he had a highly placed source at the FBI, and there is some evidence he was friends with Felt.

Woodward kept in close touch with Felt over the years, even showing up unexpectedly at the house where he was staying with his daughter, Joan, in Santa Rosa, California in 1999 after Felt&#x27;s dementia began. Some suspected at that time that Woodward might have asked Felt to reveal his identity, though Felt, when asked directly by others, had consistently denied being Deep Throat. In 2002, Timothy Noah called Felt &quot;the best guess going about the identity of Deep Throat&quot;. In 1976, Assistant Attorney General John Stanley Pottinger had convened a grand jury to investigate a series of potentially illegal break-ins Felt authorized against various dissident groups. Felt was testifying before the jury when a juror asked him, out of the blue, &quot;Were you Deep Throat?&quot; Pottinger reports that Felt, &quot;went white with fear&quot;. Pottinger explained to Felt that he was under oath and would have to answer truthfully. However, since Pottinger felt the question was outside the purview of the investigation, he offered to withdraw it if Felt wished.

According to author Ronald Kessler&#x27;s book &quot;The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI&quot;, Felt&#x27;s daughter Joan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler in an interview for his book in August 2001 that back in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at their Santa Rosa home and took Felt to lunch. Joan told Kessler that she recalled her father greeting Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. &quot;Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area,&quot; Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler&#x27;s book, which was published in 2002. &quot;He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine.&quot;

Kessler said in his book that while Felt denied to him that he was Deep Throat, the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent &quot;credence&quot; to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. Woodward confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat in 2005. &quot;There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt ...&quot; the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported. &quot;On May 3, 2002, PAGE SIX reported that Ronald Kessler, author of &quot;The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI&quot;, says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt.&quot;

In February 2005, Nixon&#x27;s former White House Counsel, news columnist John Dean, reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was ailing and Bradlee had written Deep Throat&#x27;s obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Leonard Downie, denied these claims. Felt was a suspect for Deep Throat, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999. But others had received more attention over the years, such as Pat Buchanan, Henry Kissinger, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist, General Alexander Haig, and, before &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was confirmed a man, Diane Sawyer.

=== Felt&#x27;s confirmation of his identity ===
On May 31, 2005, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reported that Felt, then aged 91, claimed to be the man once known as &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. Later that day, Woodward, Bernstein, and Bradlee released a statement through &quot;The Washington Post&quot; confirming that the story was true. On June 2, 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran a lengthy front-page column by Woodward in which he detailed his friendship with Felt in the years before Watergate. Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by chance in 1970 when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant in his mid-20s. Woodward was dispatched to deliver a package to the White House&#x27;s West Wing. Felt arrived soon after for a separate appointment and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room. Woodward struck up a conversation and eventually learned of Felt&#x27;s position in the upper echelon of the FBI. Woodward, who was about to exit the Navy at the time and was unsure about his future direction in life, became determined to use Felt as a mentor and career advisor. Therefore, he asked for Felt&#x27;s phone number and kept in touch with him.

After deciding to try a career as a reporter, Woodward eventually joined &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in August 1971. Felt, who had long had a dim view of the Nixon administration, began passing pieces of information to Woodward, although he insisted that Woodward keep the FBI and Justice Department out of anything he wrote based on the information. The first time Woodward used information from Felt in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; story was in mid-May 1972, a month before the Watergate burglary, when Woodward was reporting on Arthur Bremer, who had attempted to assassinate presidential candidate George C. Wallace. Nixon had put Felt in charge of investigating the would-be assassin. A month later, just days after the Watergate break-in, Woodward called Felt at his office, which marked the first time Woodward spoke with Felt about Watergate.

Commenting on Felt&#x27;s motivations for serving as Deep Throat, Woodward wrote, &quot;Felt believed he was protecting the bureau by finding a way, clandestine as it was, to push some of the information from the FBI interviews and files out to the public, to help build public and political pressure to make Nixon and his people answerable. He had nothing but contempt for the Nixon White House and their efforts to manipulate the Bureau for political reasons.&quot;

==Composite character theory==
Prior to Felt&#x27;s revelation and Woodward&#x27;s confirmation, part of the reason historians and other scholars had so much difficulty in identifying the real Deep Throat is that no single person seemed to truly fit the character described in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. This had caused some scholars and commentators to come to the conclusion that Deep Throat could not possibly be a single person, and must be a composite of several sources. Woodward and Bernstein consistently denied the theory.

From a literary business perspective, this theory was further supported by David Obst, the agent who originally marketed the draft for &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, who stated that the initial typescript of the book contained no reference to Deep Throat. Obst believed that Deep Throat was invented by Woodward and Bernstein for dramatic purposes. It also led to speculation that the authors condensed history.

Ed Gray, the son of L. Patrick Gray III, stated in &quot;In Nixon&#x27;s Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate&quot; that his examination of Woodward&#x27;s interview notes pertaining to Deep Throat at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin provided &quot;convincing evidence that &#x27;Deep Throat&#x27; was indeed a fabrication&quot;. According to Gray, the file contained notes regarding four interviews that were attributed to either Felt, &quot;X&quot;, or &quot;my friend&quot;, and a fifth interview dated March 24, 1973, that was unattributed. He said he discovered that he had already seen the paper in 2006 after Woodward released interview files with people who were not Deep Throat. Gray wrote that he contacted Stephen Mielke, the archivist who oversees the Woodward-Bernstein collection at the University of Texas, who said that a carbon copy of the paper contained a note in Woodward&#x27;s handwriting attributing the interview to Donald Santarelli, an official with the Department of Justice during the Watergate era. Gray wrote that he contacted Santarelli who confirmed that the March 24 meeting was with him. Other interview notes attributed to &quot;X&quot; were interpreted by Gray as containing content that could not have been known by Felt.

Regarding Gray&#x27;s allegations, Woodward wrote that the March 24 notes were obviously not from an interview with Felt because Felt is referred to by name twice in quotes from the source and that he never stated or wrote that he met with Deep Throat on that date. According to Woodward, Mielke said the page was likely misfiled under Felt due to a lack of source.

==Other suspected candidates==
===Fred Fielding===
Another leading candidate was White House Associate Counsel Fred F. Fielding. In April 2003 Fielding was presented as a potential candidate as a result of a detailed review of source material by William Gaines and his journalism students, as part of a class at the University of Illinois journalism school. Fielding was the assistant to John Dean and as such had access to the files relating to the affair. Gaines believed that statements by Woodward ruled out Deep Throat&#x27;s being in the FBI and that Deep Throat often had information before the FBI did. H. R. Haldeman himself suspected Fielding as being Deep Throat.

Dean had been one of the most dedicated hunters of Deep Throat. Both he and Leonard Garment dismissed Fielding as a possibility, reporting that he had been cleared by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Reagan administration. However, this assertion, which comes from Fielding, has not been corroborated.

One reason that many experts believed that Deep Throat was Fielding and not Felt was due to Woodward&#x27;s apparent denial in an interview that Deep Throat worked in the intelligence community:

: LUKAS: Do you resent the implication by some critics that your sources on Watergateamong them the fabled Deep Throatmay have been people in the intelligence community?

: WOODWARD: I resent it because it&#x27;s untrue.

===Other credible candidates===
Any candidate who died before the Felt admission ceased to fit Woodward&#x27;s criteria at that time since Woodward had stated that he was free to reveal Deep Throat&#x27;s identity once the person had died.
* John Ehrlichman: Nixon advisor. Died in 1999.
* Ron Ziegler: press secretary. Died in 2003.
* William E. Colby: head of the CIA. Died in 1996.
* Charles W. Bates: FBI executive whom Mann mentioned but considered less likely than Felt.
* William C. Sullivan: former head of the FBI intelligence operations, fired by J. Edgar Hoover in 1971. Died in 1977.
* L. Patrick Gray: acting FBI director who lived only four blocks away from Woodward, accused by a CBS documentary. Died in 2005.
* Robert Kunkel: FBI Washington Bureau Chief whom Mann considered less likely than Felt, as he moved to St. Louis partway through the investigation.
* Cord Meyer: CIA agent suggested in Mark Riebling&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. However, Woodward stated that Deep Throat was not part of the intelligence community. Died in 2001.
* Raymond Price: Nixon speechwriter.
* Secret Service technicians: Richard Cohen argued it was whoever in the Secret Service maintained Nixon&#x27;s secret taping devices.
* Richard Ober, the chief of the CIA&#x27;s domestic spying program called Operation CHAOS.

===Less credible candidates===
* William Rehnquist: He had a position in the Department of Justice early in the Nixon administration, working for Attorney General John N. Mitchell. More than five months before the Watergate break-in, he was appointed as the Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and it would have been almost impossible for him to have had access to much of the information attributed to Deep Throat. In February 2005, Dean reported that Deep Throat was ailing, and Rehnquist, now the Chief Justice, was known to be suffering from cancer, which caused his death later that year. The report caused a resurgence of speculation that Rehnquist was Deep Throat. However, Woodward later stated that the notion that Deep Throat was ailing had been a misunderstanding.
* Henry Kissinger: Nixon&#x27;s National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, was out of the country on some of the dates Woodward reported to have met with Deep Throat.
* George H. W. Bush: In 1972, Bush was the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. He was nominated in February 2005 by Adrian Havillauthor of a 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, &quot;Deep Truth&quot; () – following the unveiling of Woodward&#x27;s notes at the University of Texas. Havill had argued in his biography that Deep Throat was a composite figure, but stated in a letter to &quot;Poynter Online&quot; that based on more recent events and research, he now believed Deep Throat was George H. W. Bush.
* General Alexander Haig: Authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin speculated in their 1991 book &quot;Silent Coup: The Removal of a President&quot; that Haig may have been Deep Throat. Haig died in 2010.
* Diane Sawyer: She was hired by White House press secretary Ron Ziegler to serve in the Nixon administration. On his deathbed, Nixon supporter Baruch Korff wrongly claimed that Sawyer was Deep Throat.
* Ben Stein: A Nixon speechwriter and the son of Nixon economic advisor Herbert Stein; later an actor, political commentator, and game show host.
* Gerald Ford: Suggestion that Ford may have been Deep Throat as he was next in line for the presidency, although in 1972 he was still the House Minority Leader and yet to become vice president.
* Pat Buchanan: Served as special assistant to the president, was nominated as a potential candidate by Dean in his 2002 book &quot;Unmasking Deep Throat&quot; and initially suspected by the University of Illinois journalism class which eventually blamed Fielding. Buchanan, who repeatedly denied the theory, personally believed that Deep Throat was Connecticut Senator Lowell Weicker, an anti-Nixon Republican who served on the Senate Watergate Committee.
* Richard Nixon himself: There was some suggestion that Nixon had used back-channels to communicate with Woodward in a bizarre attempt to showcase his persecution by the media, which backfired. This theory was largely discredited.
* J. Fred Buzhardt: White House counsel to President Nixon.
* G. Gordon Liddy: Member of the White House Plumbers. Largely dismissed.

==In popular culture==
* Hal Holbrook portrayed Deep Throat in the film adaptation of &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), in which he uttered the catchphrase, &quot;Follow the money&quot; (which was not referred to in the book).

<text>USS &quot;Card&quot; (AVG/ ACV/ CVE/ CVHE/ CVU/T-CVU-11/ T-AKV-40) was an American that saw service in World War II. She was named for Card Sound, a continuation of Biscayne Bay, south of Miami, Florida. She was the flagship of Task Group 21.14 (TG 21.14), a hunter-killer group formed to destroy German submarines in the North Atlantic.

In 1964, while operating as an aircraft ferry, &quot;Card&quot; was sunk with explosives planted by two Viet Cong commandos in the Harbor of Saigon, South Vietnam. She was refloated 17 days later and returned to service after extensive repairs.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Card&quot;″s hull was laid down on 27 October 1941, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull #178, at Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding in Tacoma, Washington, as a Type C3-class ship (cargo type C3-S-A1) and was launched as Hull 178 on 27 February 1942, sponsored by Mrs J. Perry.

She was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 1 May 1942 and redesignated AVG-11 (Aircraft Escort Vessel #11), later reclassified as ACV-11 (Auxiliary Aircraft Carrier 11) on the 20 August 1942 and converted into an escort carrier. She was commissioned on 8 November 1942.

==Aircraft carried==
&quot;Card&quot; had capacity for up to 24 fighter and anti-submarine aircraft, normally a mixture of Grumman Wildcats and Avengers, with composition dependent upon mission. The squadron had the callsign VC-1 USN (Composite Squadron One).

==Service history==
===World War II===
Departing San Diego, California on 18 January 1943, &quot;Card&quot; arrived at Hampton Roads, Virginia on for training in the Chesapeake Bay. Captain Arnold J. Isbell assumed command of the &quot;Card&quot; on April 17, 1943. Her initial mission began in May 1943 as she escorted slow convoy of troopships and supply vessels to Casablanca in French Morocco. This convoy shipped six months after the Allied invasion of North Africa and was assembled in preparation for the subsequent invasion of Sicily. With 129 merchant ships and 19 escorts, it was the largest convoy of the war to date.

During this crossing, &quot;Card&quot; and her escorting destroyers provided daily anti-submarine patrols against U-boats by air and by sea while remaining close to the convoy. When escorting the return convoy GUS-8 back to Norfolk, however, &quot;Card&#x27;s&quot; orders permitted her to operate more freely against reported concentrations of U-boats as long as she could get back to the convoy in time to protect it. Thus began the evolution toward totally independent Hunter-killer Group (HKG) operations.

On 15 July &quot;Card&quot; was reclassified from an Auxiliary Aircraft Carrier (ACV) to an Escort Carrier (CVE). She became one of the first of fourteen US CVEs around which US anti-submarine HKGs would be based. These groups became feasible as increasing numbers of CVEs became available, along with more and better escort ships and aircraft.

They became increasingly effective with the development of improved anti-submarine weapons including Mark 24 (FIDO) homing torpedoes and Hedgehog forward-throwing depth charges. Like other US HKGs, those based on &quot;Card&quot; operated independently of convoys but, unlike UK HKGs, she operated without centralized control.

These groups used Ultra intelligence from Enigma signals to locate and destroy U-boats and their replenishment vessels. These intercepts were involved in sinking all 11 submarines sunk by &quot;Card&quot;&#x27;s HKGs and all but one of the U-boats sunk in the Battle of the Atlantic by US HKGs during the war. &quot;Card&quot; steamed from Norfolk on 27 July as flagship for TG 21.14, an HKG formed for offensive operations against German submarines. This deployment lasted until 10 September.

On 7 August her Avenger aircraft attacked while refueling &quot;U-66&quot; at . The Avengers dropped depth charges and an acoustic homing torpedo (codenamed &quot;FIDO&quot;) near &quot;U-117&quot; and &quot;U-66&quot;. Two more Avengers and two Wildcats arrived later and forced &quot;U-117&quot; to dive before dropping more depth charges and another FIDO. &quot;U-117&quot; was hit by one of two acoustic torpedoes and sank with the loss of all hands. &quot;U-66&quot; escaped and returned to the boat&#x27;s homeport, Lorient.

On 8 August 1943 fired three torpedoes at the escort carrier but all missed. The following day Aircraft from &quot;Card&quot; sank &quot;U-664&quot; in position , west-southwest of Corvo Island, with depth charges from Avengers. Seven crew members were killed and 44 rescued by .

On 11 August her aircraft sank at north-west of the Azores with all hands.

On 27 August her aircraft sank in the Sargasso Sea at , with FIDO torpedoes, all 63 hands were lost.

Her second deployment was from 25 September to 9 November 1943. Lt. (j.g.) Robert. L. Sterns spotted three submarines, , , and , refueling from the Type XIV supply and replenishment (&quot;Milchkuh&quot;) , on 4 October, north of the Azores. Coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire from the three U-boats, Lt. Sterns radioed for reinforcements and three more TBM Avengers joined the battle. Sterns dropped a &quot;Fido&quot; acoustic torpedo that sunk &quot;U-460&quot; with 62 crew lost and two rescued, and &quot;U-422&quot; was sunk at with all hands. 

On 13 October, Avenger and Wildcat aircraft sank at , with an acoustic FIDO torpedo.

On 31 October, three of her Avenger aircraft sank , at , north of Flores Island, with FIDOs and attacked , at the same location, but this boat escaped undamaged.

The fifth and final sinking of the deployment was on 1 November, by one of &quot;Card&quot;″s escorts. After a violent, close-range surface action, rammed and sank in , north of the Azores. Too badly damaged to be saved, &quot;Borie&quot; had to be sunk by a bomb dropped by one of &quot;Card&quot;″s Avengers at , east of Cape Race, Newfoundland.

For her antisubmarine activities from 27 July to 25 October, as part of TG21.14, &quot;Card&quot; and her task group were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. &quot;Card&quot; became the first escort carrier to receive such an award for combating German submarines.

&quot;Card&quot; began her third hunter-killer deployment 24 November 1943 in the North Atlantic. Late on 23 December, the group ran into wolfpack &quot;Borkum&quot;; &quot;Card&quot; had 12 contacts in 5 hours. &quot;Card&quot; and her escort were attacked by and one of her Wildcats spotted the blockade runner &quot;Osorno&quot; steaming for the Gironde estuary. One of &quot;Cards&quot; escorts, sank at on 24 December.

The escort , was sunk by the combined efforts of and at , west northwest of Cape Finisterre, Spain. &quot;Card&quot; dodged submarines all night with only &quot;Decatur&quot; as screen, while &quot;Schenck&quot; rescued survivors from &quot;Leary&quot;. The task group returned to Norfolk base on 2 January 1944.

From 18 March to 17 May 1944, &quot;Card&quot; operated on transport duty between Norfolk and Casablanca. She then underwent overhaul until 4 June, when she steamed for Quonset Point, to hold pilot qualification exercises. She returned to Norfolk, 21 June, to serve as the nucleus of TG 22.10. The hunter-killer unit departed Norfolk, 25 June, and on 5 July, two of her escorts, and , sank at . Thirty survivors, including the mortally wounded commanding officer of the submarine, were taken on board &quot;Card&quot; and put ashore at Boston, Massachusetts, the next day.

Her next anti-submarine cruise was in the Caribbean, and uneventful, 10 July – 23 August 1944. She sortied 18 September as the flagship of TG 22.2 for patrol off the Azores, during which she cooperated with British Escort Group 9 to attack a submarine on 12 October. After another patrol with TG 22.2, 1 December 1944 – 22 January 1945, &quot;Card&quot; entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for overhaul until 7 February.

She then transported Army aircraft and Army and Navy personnel to Liverpool, returning to Norfolk 12 March. From 21 March to 24 May, &quot;Card&quot; was based on Quonset Point, conducting carrier pilot qualifications. She ferried men and aircraft to Guantanamo Bay, 21–24 June, then transited the Panama Canal, to transport materiel to Pearl Harbor and Guam, returning to San Diego, 14 August.

By the end of World War II, &quot;Card&#x27;s&quot; aircraft and escorts destroyed a total of 11 German submarines, making her, along with &quot;USS Bogue&quot; with 9 German and 2 Japanese submarines, the most successful ships of her class.

Assigned to &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty, she made two voyages to Pearl Harbor, and one to the western Pacific, from 21 August to 16 December, returning servicemen to the west coast. &quot;Card&quot; departed Alameda, California, 7 January 1946, for the east coast where she was placed out of commission in reserve at Norfolk, 13 May.

She was reclassified as a helicopter escort carrier CVHE-11, 12 June 1955; a utility carrier CVU-11, 1 July 1958; and an aviation transport AKV-40, 7 May 1959.

====Awards====
In addition to her Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Card&quot; received three battle stars for service in World War II.

===Vietnam War===

The ship was reactivated on 16 May 1958, as USNS &quot;Card&quot; and operated with a civilian crew under Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) control as an aircraft transport. On 15 December 1961, &quot;Card&quot; left Quonset Point Naval Air Station in Rhode Island, with a cargo of H-21 Shawnee helicopters and soldiers from Fort Devens, bound for Vietnam. At Subic Bay, in the Philippines, the cargo and troops were transferred to the helicopter carrier , which arrived and unloaded off the coast of Da Nang, on 25 January 1962.

On 2 May 1964, while &quot;Card&quot; was moored dockside in Saigon, a Viet Cong frogman planted an explosive charge that blew a hole in the hull, killing five crewmen. &quot;Card&quot; settled in of water. She was patched, pumped out, and raised on 19 May, before being towed to Subic Bay, and then Yokosuka for repairs. &quot;Card&quot; returned to service on 11 December. The attack has parallels to the suicide bombing of , in terms of being an example of &quot;cost-effective&quot; asymmetric warfare.

During the latter part of 1967, and early part of 1968, &quot;Card&quot; brought US military helicopters to the Republic of South Vietnam. These helicopters were assembled on board the ship by members of the 388th Transportation Company, 765th Transportation Battalion, and then flown to the US Army airfield at Vũng Tàu. From there the helicopters were assigned to aviation units.

==Fate==
&quot;Card&quot; entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, at Olympia, Washington, on 10 March 1970, was sold for scrapping to Zidell Explorations, Inc for $93,899.99, on 14 May 1971 and withdrawn from the fleet on 9 June 1971.

<doc id="461563" wikidata="Q506013" url="?curid=461563" title="Deep Throat (film)">
<text>Deep Throat is a 1972 landmark American pornographic film written and directed by Gerard Damiano, listed in the credits as &quot;Jerry Gerard&quot;, and starring Linda Lovelace (Linda Susan Boreman). It is considered the forefront of the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984).

One of the first pornographic films to feature a plot, character development, and relatively high production values, &quot;Deep Throat&quot; earned mainstream attention and launched the &quot;porno chic&quot; trend, although the film was the subject of obscenity trials and banned in some jurisdictions. Lovelace later wrote that she was coerced and sexually assaulted during the production, and that the film is genuine rape pornography.

==Plot==
Linda Lovelace, a sexually frustrated woman, seeks advice from her friend Helen on how to achieve an orgasm. After attending a sex party that proves unhelpful, Helen suggests that Linda visit a psychiatrist named Dr. Young. During their sessions, the doctor discovers that Linda&#x27;s clitoris is located in her throat, instead of its normal location. Because stimulation of the clitoris is usually required for a woman to achieve orgasm, Linda would need to develop an oral sex technique that would stimulate her unusually located clitoris.

Dr. Young assists Linda in developing this technique. During this process, Linda becomes infatuated with Dr. Young and proposes marriage. Dr. Young responds that Linda should instead become his therapist, utilizing her particular oral technique—henceforth known as &quot;deep-throating&quot;—on various men until she finds a suitable husband. Simultaneously, the doctor documents her exploits in repeated sexual encounters with his nurse. Eventually, Linda meets a man who brings her happiness and sexual fulfilment, and she agrees to marry him. The movie concludes with the line, &quot;The End. And Deep Throat to you all.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
The scenes involving Lovelace were shot in North Miami, Florida over six days in January 1972. The interior scenes were shot at a hotel between 123rd and 124th Streets on Biscayne Boulevard, then known as the Voyager Inn. The building was subsequently converted to a dormitory for Johnson &amp; Wales University. The scenes involving Carol Connors were shot in New York City.

The movie was produced by Louis &quot;Butchie&quot; Peraino, who was listed in the credits as &quot;Lou Perry&quot;. Peraino was the owner of Plymouth Distributing, which he later renamed Arrow Film and Video. The entire production cost of $22,500 (equivalent to $ today), and an additional $25,000 ($ today) for music, was provided by Peraino&#x27;s father, Anthony Peraino, a member of the Colombo crime family. Gerard Damiano, who had rights to one-third of the profits, was reportedly paid a lump sum of $25,000 once the film became popular and was forced out of the partnership. John Franzese also had a financial stake in the film.

==Reception==
In a March 1973 column, critic Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;It is all very well and good for Linda Lovelace, the star of the movie, to advocate sexual freedom; but the energy she brings to her role is less awesome than discouraging. If you have to work this hard at sexual freedom, maybe it isn&#x27;t worth the effort.&quot; A review in &quot;Variety&quot; stated that although the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its reputation as the &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; of porno pix, it is a superior piece which stands a head above the competition.&quot; Al Goldstein wrote a rave review in his &quot;Screw&quot; magazine, saying &quot;I was never so moved by any theatrical performance since stuttering through my own bar mitzvah.&quot;

===Porno chic and pop culture influence===
&quot;Deep Throat&quot; officially premiered at the World Theater in New York on June 12, 1972, and was advertised in &quot;The New York Times&quot; under the bowdlerized title &quot;Throat&quot;.

The film&#x27;s popularity helped launch a brief period of upper-middle class interest in explicit pornography referred to by Ralph Blumenthal of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;porno chic&quot;. Several mainstream celebrities admitted to having seen &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, including Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Truman Capote, Jack Nicholson, Johnny Carson, Spiro Agnew, Frank Sinatra, Philip Dresmann and Louis Derfert. Barbara Walters mentions having seen the film in her autobiography, &quot;&quot;. Jimmy McMillan considers it to be his favorite film.

The film&#x27;s title soon became a pop culture reference, most notably when Howard Simons, the then-managing editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, chose it as the code name for a well-guarded secret inside informant during the Watergate scandal that plagued the administration of President Richard M. Nixon, who many years later was revealed to be assistant FBI director W. Mark Felt.

==Revenue==
&quot;Deep Throat&quot; grossed $1 million (equivalent to $ million today) in its first seven weeks of release in 1972, including a then-porn film single-screen record of $30,033 ($ today) in its opening week at New York City&#x27;s New World Theatre. The film made a then-record $3 million ($ million today) in its first six months of release and was still ranked among the top 10 highest-grossing films, as ranked by &quot;Variety&quot;, 48 weeks after its release.

Estimates of the film&#x27;s total revenues have varied widely: numbers as high as $600 million (equivalent to $ billion today) have been cited, which would make &quot;Deep Throat&quot; one of the highest-grossing films of all time. With an average ticket price of $5 ($ today), box-office takings of $600 million would imply 120 million admissions, an unrealistic figure. Although subsequent sales of the film on home video certainly brought additional revenue, the FBI&#x27;s estimate that the film produced an income of approximately $100 million ($ million today) may be closer to the truth. Michael Hiltzik of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also argues for a lower figure in a February 2005 article, pointing out that &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was banned outright in large parts of the US (as well as many other countries), and only tended to find screenings in a small network of adult theaters in larger urban centers. The directors of &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot; responded to the article, suggesting that actual revenues from the film were possibly even higher than the $600 million figure. Hiltzik was unsatisfied with the directors&#x27; response, writing that their method was to &quot;construct a seemingly solid box office figure out of layers and layers of speculation piled upon a foundation of sand&quot;.

Roger Ebert noted as well in his review of &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot;, a 2005 documentary about the film&#x27;s cultural legacy, that many theaters that screened the film were mob-connected enterprises, which probably also &quot;inflated box office receipts as a way of laundering income from drugs and prostitution&quot; and other illegal activities.

In 2006, a censored edition of the film was released on DVD for fans of pop culture and those wishing to own a non-X-rated copy of the infamous movie. &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was the first film to be inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame.

==Controversies==

===Linda Boreman&#x27;s allegations===
In her first two biographies, Linda Boreman characterized having made the film as a liberating experience; in her third and fourth biographies, both of which were written after she had come out with her stories of sexual abuse, rape, and forced prostitution in the porn business, she charged that she had not consented to many of the depicted sexual acts and that she had been coerced to perform by her abusive then-husband Chuck Traynor, who received $1,250 (equivalent to $ today) for her acting. She also claimed that Traynor threatened to kill her, brandishing handguns and rifles to control her.&lt;ref name=&quot;exberliner/deep-throat&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, she testified before the Meese Commission, &quot;Virtually every time someone watches that movie, they&#x27;re watching me being raped.&quot; In the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; on March 20, 1981, she said, &quot;It is a crime that movie is still showing; there was a gun to my head the entire time.&quot; While the other people present on the set did not support the gun charge, both Traynor and Damiano confirmed in interviews that Traynor was extremely controlling towards Boreman and also hit her on occasion. In the documentary &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot;, it is claimed that bruises are visible on Boreman&#x27;s body in the movie.

These allegations were cited in the UK Government&#x27;s Rapid Evidence Assessment on &quot;The evidence of harm to adults relating to exposure to extreme pornographic material&quot; as part of its plans to criminalize possession of what it termed &quot;extreme pornography&quot;.

===Obscenity litigation===
In various United States communities, the movie was shown to juries to determine whether it was obscene; the outcomes varied widely and the movie was banned in numerous locations.

In August 1972, after a jury in New York City had found the movie not to be obscene,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/2022/03/09/Ferretti&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; prosecutors decided to charge Mature Enterprises, the company that owned the World Theater, for promotion of obscene material, taking them to trial in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1972/12/18/film-trial-today&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, a psychiatrist testified that the film portrayed acts that were &quot;well within the bounds of normal behavior&quot;. A film critic testified the movie had social value because it showed sympathy for female desires, because the script contained humor and because it was filmed &quot;with clarity and lack of grain&quot;. Conversely, in response to a claim the film was a spoof of sexual behavior, a New York University professor said, &quot;I do not see how you can spoof fellatio by showing continuous performance of fellatio.&quot; On March 1, 1973, Judge Joel J. Tyler ruled &quot;Deep Throat&quot; to be obscene, issuing his opinion on the film as &quot;this feast of carrion and squalor&quot;, &quot;a nadir of decadence&quot; and &quot;a Sodom and Gomorrah gone wild before the fire&quot;. Judge Tyler fined Mature Enterprises $100,000 (equivalent to $ today), which was later reduced on appeal. The ruling inadvertently contributed to the film&#x27;s becoming perhaps the most popular X-rated movie of all time.

In 1976, there was a series of federal cases in Memphis, Tennessee, where over 60 individuals and companies, including the Perainos and actor Harry Reems, were indicted for conspiracy to distribute obscenity across state lines. Damiano and Lovelace were granted immunity in exchange for testimony. Federal District Court judge Harry W. Wellford heard the case, and the trial ended with a conviction. This was the first time that an actor had been prosecuted by the federal government on obscenity charges. (Lenny Bruce had been prosecuted in the 1960s by local authorities.) Reems became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; and received considerable support from Hollywood circles. On appeal, he was represented by Alan Dershowitz, and his conviction was overturned: the Miller test (the three-pronged standard from the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1973 decision in &quot;Miller v. California&quot; that determines what constitutes obscenity) was applied in his case. The Federal Bureau of Investigation case known as &quot;Miporn&quot; convicted and sentenced, on April 30, 1977, Michael Cherubino to five months&#x27; imprisonment and a fine of $4,000, Anthony Novello to six months&#x27; imprisonment, Joseph Peraino to one year&#x27;s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 (including a $10,000 fine to his company, Plymouth Distributors Inc.), Louis Peraino to one year&#x27;s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 (including a $10,000 fine to each of his two companies, Bryanston Distributors Inc. and Gerard Damiano Productions Inc.), Anthony Battista to four months&#x27; imprisonment and a fine of $4,000, Carl Carter to six months&#x27; imprisonment and a fine of $6,500, Mel Friedman to nine months&#x27; imprisonment and a fine of $7,500, and Mario Desalvo to three months&#x27; imprisonment and a fine of $3,500.

In 1975, a Sioux Falls, South Dakota jury found the film not obscene.&lt;ref name=&quot;texas-law-review/8459-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Antonio, police seized the movie and its movie projector from a theater several times in the space of two weeks.

Herman Hausman, manager of Franklin Art Theater on South Avenue, Syracuse, New York, was charged with second degree obscenity.&lt;ref name=&quot;syracuse/charge_over_deep_throat&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the movie was banned upon release, and the ban was upheld by the courts 10 years later. The uncut DVD of the movie was finally given an R18 rating in 2000, which allowed it to be sold in licensed sex shops in the UK.

===Copyright===
&quot;Deep Throat&quot; was released without a copyright notice. Because Peraino had used four wall distribution for all of &quot;Deep Throat&quot;″s releases, that left the potential for the film to be classified as an unpublished work, preventing it from falling into the public domain. Peraino sold the rights to the film to Arrow Productions for home video release (including a copyright notice) at some point prior to 2009. Despite Arrow holding the rights, rival pornography distributor VCX began distributing &quot;Deep Throat&quot; as retaliation for Arrow&#x27;s distribution of &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, two films VCX asserted were under their copyright. (In the former case, &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; was determined to be public domain in a 1987 court ruling.) In order to prevent VCX from challenging the copyright on &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, Arrow Productions agreed in 2011 to voluntarily stop distributing &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, thus leaving their copyright status unresolved.

===Broadcasting===
In April 1978, pirate station Lucky 7 in Syracuse, New York illegally aired &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (and also &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;, as well as non-pornographic fare such as episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;). The pirates have never been identified.

On February 23, 2008, the Netherlands Public Broadcasting corporations VPRO and BNN screened &quot;Deep Throat&quot; on national television as part of a themed night on the history of pornographic films, and the influence of pornography in youth culture in the Netherlands. Although the film aired after 10 p.m., following a guideline for adult television, and was embedded in a discussion program, several political parties (especially Dutch cabinet member party Christian Union) were clamoring for steps to be taken to prevent airing. The Minister of Education and Media, Ronald Plasterk, declared that he could not and did not want to forbid the airing of the film. The movie was seen by 907,000 viewers.

===Identity of &quot;Dolly Sharp&quot;===
In December 2014, &quot;The Rialto Report&quot;, a web site devoted to the history of the so-called Golden Age of Porn, made the surprise announcement that the supporting actress billed as Dolly Sharp, who had vanished into obscurity shortly after the release of &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, was in fact Helen Wood (1935–1998), a former Broadway performer who, as a teenager, had a major role in the 1953 Hollywood musical &quot;Give a Girl a Break&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
An original soundtrack album for the film was released in 1972. Few copies exist today and when on the market, they have sold for as much as US$300. The album contains both instrumental and vocals tracks as well as short snippets of dialog from the film (indicated with quotations in the list below). All artists are unknown. A remixed and remastered CD and LP version is available from Light in the Attic Records (see links). Director Gerard Damiano reportedly edited the sex scenes to conform to different musical cues. The film opens with an instrumental track that echoes the hook of the 1968 easy listening hit, &quot;Do You Know the Way to San Jose&quot;.

==Sequels and remakes==
The original sequel to &quot;Deep Throat&quot;—&quot;Deep Throat Part II&quot;—was written and directed by Joseph W. Sarno and featured the original stars Linda Lovelace and Harry Reems. Shot in New York City in early 1973, it was released in New York in February 1974 with an MPAA &quot;R&quot; rating. Although attributed to Damiano Films, &quot;Deep Throat&quot; director Gerard Damiano was not involved with its production. The film was produced by &quot;Deep Throat&quot; producer Louis Peraino, who had in the meantime founded the mainstream distribution company Bryanston Films. The version of &quot;Deep Throat Part II&quot; currently available on DVD is bowdlerized to the point where the film contains virtually no sexual content of any sort, probably a byproduct of its efforts to receive an MPAA R rating at the time of its release. An Italian DVD release of the film, however, contains its original softcore sex scenes. It has long been claimed that &quot;Deep Throat Part II&quot; was originally shot with the intention of releasing it as a hardcore feature and that hardcore sequences shot for the film were stolen while the film was in post-production. Director Joe Sarno, however, has insisted in interviews that this is not the case.

Vivid Entertainment owner Steven Hirsch told XFANZ reporters at the FAME Awards in June 2008 that the company is producing a remake of &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. The making of this film was the subject of the Showtime original series &quot;Deeper Throat&quot;.

Vivid had planned to release its remake but Arrow Productions, the copyright owner, did not like the deviation from the original storyline or the manner in which the film was directed and cast. They then withdrew permission to make the remake to &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, and forced Steve Hirsch to remarket and edit his movie for copyright purposes.

Hirsch changed the name of the title to &quot;Throat: A Cautionary Tale&quot;, and it was released in March 2009.
* &quot;Deep Throat II&quot; (1987, and not related to the earlier film of the same name) and the subsequent &quot;DT&quot; sequels, have different actors and directors and, despite the title, are not continuations of the story of &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. &quot;Deep Throat II&quot; won the 1988 AVN Award for &#x27;Best Couples Sex Scene – Film&#x27; and 1988 XRCO Awards for best screenplay (Michael Evans), best actor (Jamie Gillis) and best actress (Krista Lane).
* &quot;Deep Throat 3&quot; (1989) starred Peter North
* &quot;Deep Throat 4&quot; (1990) directed by Ron Jeremy
* &quot;Deep Throat 5&quot; (1991) directed by Ron Jeremy and starring Victoria Paris, Debi Diamond, Cameo
* &quot;Deep Throat 6&quot; (1992) directed by Ron Jeremy.

== 50th anniversary re-release ==
In 2022, which marked the 50th anniversary of the film, the film was restored and re-released and several screenings were held. Since all of the principals and the director Damiano have since died, the movie&#x27;s restoration was overseen by Damiano&#x27;s children, Christar and Gerard Damiano Jr., in collaboration with Robin Leonardi, the surviving daughter of another adult industry trailblazer, and a contemporary of the original &quot;Deep Throat&quot; trio, Gloria Leonard.

<text>Lewis Henry Morgan (November 21, 1818 – December 17, 1881) was a pioneering American anthropologist and social theorist who worked as a railroad lawyer. He is best known for his work on kinship and social structure, his theories of social evolution, and his ethnography of the Iroquois. Interested in what holds societies together, he proposed the concept that the earliest human domestic institution was the matrilineal clan, not the patriarchal family.

Also interested in what leads to social change, he was a contemporary of the European social theorists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who were influenced by reading his work on social structure and material culture, the influence of technology on progress. Morgan is the only American social theorist to be cited by such diverse scholars as Marx, Charles Darwin, and Sigmund Freud. Elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, Morgan served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1880.

Morgan was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly (Monroe Co., 2nd D.) in 1861, and of the New York State Senate in 1868 and 1869.

==Biography==

===The American Morgans===
According to Herbert Marshall Lloyd, an attorney and editor of Morgan&#x27;s works, Lewis was descended from James Morgan, a Welsh pioneer. Various sources record that James and his brothers, Miles and John, the three sons of William Morgan of Llandaff, Glamorganshire, left Wales for Boston in 1636. From there John Morgan went to Virginia, Miles to Springfield, Massachusetts, and James to New London, Connecticut. Lloyd writes, &quot;From these two brothers [James and Miles] all the Morgans prominent in the annals of New York and New England are believed to be descended.&quot; It is these Morgans who played a critical part in the foundation of the colonies. During the American Revolutionary War, they were Continentals. Immediately after the war, James&#x27;s line, along with many other land-hungry Yankees, migrated into New York State. Following the United States&#x27; victory against the British, the new government forced the latter&#x27;s Iroquois allies to cede most of their traditional lands in New York and Pennsylvania to the US. New York made 5 million acres available for public sale. In addition, the US government granted some plots in western New York to Revolutionary War veterans as compensation for their military service. L. H. Morgan&#x27;s ancestor James Morgan&#x27;s brother Miles Morgan was a seventh generation ancestor of J. P. Morgan.

===Early life and education===
Lewis&#x27; grandfather, Thomas Morgan of Connecticut, had been a Continental soldier in the Revolutionary War. Afterward he and his family migrated west to New York&#x27;s Finger Lakes region, where he bought land from the Cayuga people and planted a farm on the shores of Lake Cayuga near Aurora. He and his wife already had three sons, including Jedediah, the future father of Lewis; and a daughter.

In 1797, Jedediah Morgan (1774–1826) married Amanda Stanton, settling on a 100-acre gift of land from his father. After she had five children and died, Jedediah married Harriet Steele of Hartford, Connecticut. They had eight more children, including Lewis. As an adult, he adopted the middle initial &quot;H.&quot; Morgan later decided that this H, if anything, stood for &quot;Henry&quot;.

A multi-skilled Yankee, Jedediah Morgan invented a plow and formed a business partnership to manufacture parts for it; he built a blast furnace for the factory. He moved to Aurora, leaving the farm to a son. After joining the Masons, he helped to form the first Masonic lodge in Aurora. Elected a state senator, Morgan supported the construction of the Erie Canal, which opened in 1825.

At his death in 1826, Jedediah left 500 acres with herds and flocks in trust for the support of his family. This provided for education as well. Morgan studied classical subjects at Cayuga Academy: Latin, Greek, rhetoric and mathematics. His father had bequeathed money specifically for his college education, after giving land to the other children for their occupations. Morgan chose Union College in Schenectady. Due to his work at Cayuga Academy, Morgan finished college in two years, 1838–1840, graduating at age 22. The curriculum continued study of classics combined with science, especially mechanics and optics. Morgan was strongly interested in the works of the French naturalist Georges Cuvier.

Eliphalet Nott, the president of Union College, was an inventor of stoves and a boiler; he held 31 patents. A Presbyterian minister, he kept the young men under a tight discipline, forbidding alcoholic beverages and requiring students to get permission to go to town. He held up the Bible as the one practical standard for all behavior. His career ended with some notoriety when he was investigated by the state for attempting to raise funds for the college through a lottery. The students evaded his strict regime by founding secret (and forbidden) fraternities, such as the Kappa Alpha Society. Lewis Morgan joined in 1839.

===The New Confederacy of the Iroquois===

After graduating in 1840, Morgan returned to Aurora to read the law with an established firm. In 1842 he was admitted to the bar in Rochester, where he went into partnership with a Union classmate, George F. Danforth, a future judge. They could find no clients, as the nation was in an economic depression, which had started with the Panic of 1837. Morgan wrote essays, which he had begun to do while studying law, and published some in &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot; under the pen name Aquarius.

On January 1, 1841, Morgan and some friends from Cayuga Academy formed a secret fraternal society which they called the Gordian Knot. As Morgan&#x27;s earliest essays from that time had classical themes, the club may have been a kind of literary society, as was common then. In 1841 or 1842 the young men redefined the society, renaming it the Order of the Iroquois. Morgan referred to this event as cutting the knot. In 1843 they named it the Grand Order of the Iroquois, followed by the New Confederacy of the Iroquois. They made the group a research organization to collect information on the Iroquois, whose historical territory for centuries had included central and upstate New York west of the Hudson and the Finger Lakes region.

The men intended to resurrect the spirit of the Iroquois. They tried to learn the languages, assumed Iroquois names, and organized the group by the historic pattern of Iroquois tribes. In 1844 they received permission from the former Freemasons of Aurora to use the upper floor of the Masonic temple as a meeting hall. New members underwent a secret rite called &quot;inindianation&quot; in which they were transformed spiritually into Iroquois. They met in the summer around campfires and paraded yearly through the town in costume. Morgan seemed infused with the spirit of the Iroquois. He said, &quot;We are now upon the very soil over which they exercised dominion ... Poetry still lingers around the scenery. ... &quot; These new Iroquois retained a literary frame of mind, but they intended to focus on &quot;the writing of a native American epic that would define national identity&quot;.

===Encounter with the Iroquois===

On an 1844 business trip to New York&#x27;s capital, Albany, Morgan started research on old Cayuga treaties in the state archives. The Seneca people were also studying old US-Native American treaties to support their land claims.

After the Revolutionary War, the United States had forced the four Iroquois tribes allied with the British to cede their lands and migrate to Canada. By specific treaties, the US set aside small reservations in New York for their own allies, the Onondaga and Seneca. In the 1840s, long after the war, the Ogden Land Company, a real estate venture, laid claim to the Seneca Tonawanda Reservation on the basis of a fraudulent treaty. The Seneca sued and had representatives at the state capital pressing their case when Morgan was there.

The delegation, led by Jimmy Johnson, its chief officer (and son of chief Red Jacket), were essentially former officers of what was left of the Iroquois Confederacy. Johnson&#x27;s 16-year-old grandson &quot;Ha-sa-ne-an-da&quot; (Ely Parker) accompanied them as their interpreter, as he had attended a mission school and was bilingual. By chance Morgan and the young Parker encountered each other in an Albany book store. Soon intrigued by Morgan&#x27;s talk of the New Confederacy, Parker invited the older man to interview Johnson and meet the delegation. Morgan took pages of organizational notes, which he used to remodel the New Confederacy. Beyond such details of scholarship, Morgan and the Seneca men formed deep attachments of friendship.

Morgan and his colleagues invited Parker to join the New Confederacy. They (chiefly Morgan) paid for the rest of Parker&#x27;s education at the Cayuga Academy, along with his sister and a friend of hers. Later the Confederacy paid for Parker&#x27;s studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, where he graduated in civil engineering. After military service in the American Civil War, from which Parker retired at the rank of brigadier general, he entered the upper ranks of civil service in the presidency of his former commander, Ulysses S. Grant.

===The Ogden Land Company affair===
Meanwhile, the organization had had activist goals from the beginning. In his initial New Gordius address Morgan had said:

... when the last tribe shall slumber in the grass, it is to be feared that the stain of blood will be found on the escutcheon of the American republic. This nation must shield their declining day ...

In 1838 the Ogden Land Company began a campaign to defraud the remaining Iroquois in New York of their lands. By Iroquois law, only a unanimous vote of all the chiefs sitting in council could effect binding decisions relating to the tribe. The OLC set about to purchase the votes of as many chiefs as it could, plying some with alcohol. The chiefs in many cases complied, believing any resolutions to sell the land would be defeated in council. Obtaining a majority vote for sale at one council called for the purpose, the OLC took their treaty to the Congress of the United States, which knew nothing of Iroquois law. President Martin Van Buren advised Congress that the treaty was fraudulent but on June 11, 1838, Congress adopted it as a resolution. After being compensated for their land by $1.67 per acre (Morgan said it was worth $16 per acre), the Seneca were to be evicted forthwith.

The great majority of the tribe were against the sale of the land. When they discovered they had been defrauded, they were galvanized to action. The New Confederacy stepped into the case on the side of the Seneca, conducting a major publicity campaign. They held mass meetings, circulated a general petition, and spoke to congressmen in Washington. The US Indian agent and ethnologist Henry Rowe Schoolcraft and other influential men became honorary members. In 1846 a general convention of the population of Genesee County, New York sent Morgan to Congress with a counter-offer. The Seneca were allowed to buy back some land at $20 per acre, at which time the Tonawanda Reservation was created. The previous treaty was thrown out. Returning home, Morgan was adopted into the Hawk Clan, Seneca Tribe, as the son of Jimmy Johnson on October 31, 1847, in part to honor his work with the Seneca on the reservation issues. They named him &quot;Tayadaowuhkuh&quot;, meaning &quot;bridging the gap&quot; (between the Iroquois and the European Americans).
After Morgan was admitted to the tribe, he lost interest in the New Confederacy. The group retained its secrecy and initiation requirements, but they were being hotly disputed. When internal dissent began to impede the group&#x27;s efficacy in 1847, Morgan stopped attending. For practical purposes it ceased to exist, but Morgan and Parker continued with a series of &quot;Iroquois Letters&quot; to the &quot;American Whig Review&quot;, edited by George Colton. The Seneca case dragged on. Finally in 1857 the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that only the federal government could evict the Seneca from their land. As it declined to do that, the case was over. The Ogden Land Company collapsed.

===Marriage and family===
In 1851 Morgan summarized his investigation of Iroquois customs in his first book of note, &quot;League of the Iroquois&quot;, one of the founding works of ethnology. In it he compares systems of kinship. In that year also he married his cross-cousin, Mary Elizabeth Steele, his companion and partner for the rest of his life. She had intended to become a Presbyterian missionary. On their wedding day he presented to her an ornate copy of his new book. It was dedicated to his collaborator, Ely Parker.

In 1853 Mary&#x27;s father died, leaving her a large inheritance. The Morgans bought a brownstone in a wealthy suburb of Rochester. In that year they had a son, Lemuel, who &quot;turned out to be mentally handicapped&quot;. Morgan&#x27;s rising fame had brought him public attention, and Lemuel&#x27;s condition (on no specific evidence) was universally attributed to the first-cousin marriage. The Morgans had to endure perpetual criticism, which they accepted as true, Lewis going so far as to take a stand against cousin marriage in his book &quot;Ancient Society&quot;. The Morgan marriage nevertheless remained a close and affectionate one. In 1856, Mary Elisabeth was born and in 1860 Helen King.

Morgan and his wife were active in the First Presbyterian Church of Rochester, although it was mainly of interest to Mary. Lewis refused to make &quot;the public profession of Christ that was necessary for full membership&quot;. They both sponsored and contributed to charitable works.

===Supporting education===
For several years &quot;his ethnical interests lay dormant&quot;, but not his scholarship and writing. In 1852 Morgan and eight other &quot;Rochester intellectuals&quot; instituted The Pundit Club, shortened later to just The club, a scientific and literary society before which the members read papers they had researched for the occasion. Morgan read papers to The Club every year for the rest of his life. He also joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Morgan and other leading men of Rochester decided to found a university, the University of Rochester. It did not support the matriculation of women. The group resolved to found a college for women, the Barleywood Female University, which was advertised but apparently never started. In the same year of its foundation, 1852, the donor of the land on which it was to be located gave it to the University of Rochester instead. Morgan was gravely disappointed. He believed that equality of the sexes is a mark of advanced civilization. For the present, he lacked the wealth and connections to prevent the collapse of Barleywood. Later he would serve as a founding trustee of the board of Wells College in Aurora. In addition, he and Mary would leave their estate to the University of Rochester for the foundation of a women&#x27;s college.

===Success at last===
In 1855 Morgan and other Rochester businessmen invested in the expanding metals industry of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. After a brief sojourn on the 5-man board of the Iron Mountain Railroad, Morgan joined them in creating the Bay de Noquet and Marquette Railroad Company, connecting the entire Upper Peninsula by a single, ore-bearing line. He became its attorney and director. At that time the U.S. government was selling lands previously confiscated from the natives in cases where the sale benefited the public good. Although the Upper Peninsula was known for its great natural beauty, the discovery of iron persuaded Morgan and others to develop wide-scale mining and industrialization of the peninsula. He spent the next few years between Washington, lobbying for the sale of the land to his company, and in large cities such as Detroit and Chicago, where he fought lawsuits to prevent competitors from taking it. Morgan vigorously defended American capitalism to protect his own interests. After the stockholders refused to pay him for some of his legal work, he all but withdrew from business in favor of field work in anthropology.

In 1861 in the middle of his field work, Morgan was elected as Member of the New York State Assembly on the Republican ticket. The Morgans traditionally had belonged to the Whigs, which dissolved in 1856; most Whigs joined the Republicans, created in 1854. Morgan did not run with any agenda except his own as it pertained to the Iroquois. He was seeking appointment by the President of the United States as Commissioner of the new Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Morgan anticipated that William H. Seward would be elected president, and outlined to him plans to employ the natives in the manufacture and sale of Indian goods.

At the last moment Abraham Lincoln displaced Seward as the Republican candidate. The new president was deluged by letters from Morgan&#x27;s associates asking that Morgan be appointed commissioner. Lincoln explained that the post had already been exchanged by his campaign manager for political support. With the chance for appointment lost, Morgan, who had made no pretense of interest in New York state&#x27;s government, returned to field study of the natives.

===Field anthropologist===
After attending the 1856 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Morgan decided on an ethnology study to compare kinship systems. He conducted a field research program funded by himself and the Smithsonian Institution, 1859–1862. He made four expeditions, two to the Plains tribes of Kansas and Nebraska, and two more up the Missouri River past Yellowstone. This was before the development of any inland transportation system. Passengers on riverboats could shoot Bison and other game for food along the upper Missouri River. He collected data on 51 kinship systems. Tribes included the Winnebago, Crow, Yankton, Kaw, Blackfeet, Omaha and others.

At the height of Morgan&#x27;s anthropological field work, death struck his family. In May and June, 1862, their two daughters, ages 6 and 2, died as a result of scarlet fever while Morgan was traveling in the West. In Sioux City, Iowa, Morgan received the news from his wife. He wrote in his journal:

Two of three of my children are taken. Our family is destroyed. The intelligence has simply petrified me. I have not shed a tear. It is too profound for tears. Thus ends my last expedition. I go home to my stricken and mourning wife, a miserable and destroyed man.

=== The Civil War===
During this time, neither Morgan nor Mary showed any interest in abolitionism, nor did they participate in the American Civil War. They differed markedly from their friend Ely Parker. The latter attempted to raise an Iroquois regiment but was denied, on the grounds that he was not a US citizen, and denied service on the same ground. He entered the army finally by the intervention of his friend, Ulysses S. Grant, serving on Grant&#x27;s staff. Parker was present at the surrender of General Lee; to Lee&#x27;s remark that Parker was the &quot;true American&quot; (as an American Indian), he responded, &quot;We are all Americans here, sir.&quot;

Morgan held no consistent views on the war. He could easily have joined the anti-slavery cause if he had wished to do so. Rochester, as the last station before Canada on the Underground Railroad, was a center of abolitionism. Frederick Douglass published the &quot;North Star&quot; in Rochester. Like Morgan, Douglass supported the equality of women, yet they never made connection.

Morgan was anti-slavery but opposed abolitionism on the grounds that slavery was protected by law. Before the war he assented to the possible division of the nation on the grounds of &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;, that is, slavery, between regions. Morgan began to change his mind when some of his friends who had gone out to watch the First Battle of Bull Run were captured and imprisoned by the Confederates for the duration. By the end of the war, he was insisting along with most others that Jefferson Davis be hanged as a traitor. In 1866 he formed the Rochester Committee for the Relief of Southern Starvation.

Morgan did participate indirectly in the war through his company. Recovering from the deaths of his daughters and having resolved to end the expeditions that had taken him away from home, he gave his life totally over to business. In 1863 he and Samuel Ely formed a partnership creating the Morgan Iron Company in northern Michigan. The war had created such a high demand for metals that within the first year of business, the company paid off its founding debt and offered 100% dividends on its stock. The demand went on until 1868, enabling the company to construct a blast furnace. Morgan became independently wealthy and could retire from the practice of law.

===The Erie Railroad affair===
Morgan took up trout fishing during his Michigan period. He fished in the wilds of Michigan during the summers, sometimes with Ojibwe guides. During this recreational activity, he became interested in beavers, which had greatly modified the lowlands. After several summers of tracking and observing beavers in the field, in 1868 he published a work describing in detail the biology and habits of this animal, which shaped the environment through its construction of dams.

In that year also, his wealth secure and free of business, Morgan entered the state government again as a senator, 1868–1869, still seeking appointment as head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He was ridiculed by the &quot;Union Advertiser&quot; as being a &quot;hobby candidate&quot;. The Republicans that year were running on a platform of moral probity. They argued that as a superior class, they could and should serve as guardians of the public morals. Morgan passed muster on the heredity because of his descent and Mary&#x27;s descent from William Bradford, of Mayflower note. Morgan soon was immersed in such issues as whether beer drinking on Sunday should be allowed (a veiled hit at the new German immigrants).

As member of the Standing Committee on Railroads, Morgan became embroiled in a major issue of the day and one closer to his interests: monopoly. The New York Central Railroad, under Cornelius Vanderbilt, had attempted a hostile takeover of the Erie Railroad under Jay Gould by buying up its stock. The two railroads competed for the Rochester market. Daniel Drew, Erie&#x27;s treasurer, defended successfully by creating new stock, which he had his friends sold short, dropping the value of the stock. Vanderbilt dumped the stock, barely covering the losses. Ordinarily such stock manipulations were illegal. The Railroad Act of 1850, however, allowed railroads to borrow money in exchange for bonds convertible to stocks. Given essentially free stocks, friends of the Erie Railroad grew rich; that is, Drew had found a way to transfer Vanderbilt&#x27;s wealth to his own friends. Vanderbilt just escaped ruin. He immediately appealed to the state government.

The Railroad Committee investigated the affair. Gould purchased inaction among the senators, a practice Morgan had seen in the Ogden Land Company Affair. This time he worked to protect his friends from investigation. No action was taken. The Erie Railroad affair tapped Morgan&#x27;s deepest ideological beliefs. To him the role of capitalism in creating mobile wealth was essential to the advancement of civilization. A monopoly such as Vanderbilt had been trying to build would choke off the downward flow of wealth. His report of the Railroad Committee attacked both Vanderbilt and Gould. It argued that the system in its &quot;tendency to combination&quot; was broken. He asserted that the people had to use government action to rein in the power of large corporations. For the time being the Erie Railroad was supported, but Morgan noted that its victory was just as dangerous to society as its defeat would have been.

===The Grant-Parker policy on Native Americans===
Despite his new interest in government, which was to come to be expressed in his subsequent works on social systems, Morgan persisted in his major goal in running for office, to be appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The choice was now up to President Grant. Together in &quot;The League&quot;, Parker and Morgan had determined the policy Grant was to adopt. They thought that, much as Parker had assimilated, American Indians should assimilate into American society; they were not yet considered US citizens. Of the two men responsible for his policy, Grant chose his former adjutant. Terribly disappointed, Morgan never applied for the post again. The two collaborators did not speak to each other during Parker&#x27;s tenure, but Morgan stayed on intimate terms with Parker&#x27;s family.

The implementation of assimilation policy was more difficult than either man had anticipated. Parker controlled none of the variables. The American Indians were to be moved into reservations, assisted with supplies and food so they could start subsistence farming, and educated at mission schools to be converted to Christianity and American values, until they adopted European-American ways. In theory they would then be able to enter American society at large. The system of appointed Indian agents and traders had long been corrupt; in addition, unscrupulous land agents took the best land and moved American Indians into the desert lands, which did not support small-scale household farms and did not have sufficient game for hunting. Thieves among the agents replaced food and goods intended for the Indians with inedible or no foodstuffs. Faced with these realities, the American Indians refused the reservations or abandoned them, and attempted to return to ancestral lands, now occupied by white settlers. In other cases, they raided white settlements for food or attacked them seeking to repel the invaders. Grant resorted to military solutions and used U.S. soldiers to repress the tribes. This warfare exacerbated the failure of the army to protect the American Indians against depredations and encroachment by white settlers.

In 1871 Congress took action to halt the suppression of the Natives. It created a Board of Indian Commissioners and relieved Parker of his main responsibilities. Parker resigned in protest. After suffering years of poverty and attempt to suppress their cultures, American Indians were admitted to citizenship in 1924. The government continued to send their children to Indian boarding schools, started in the late 1870s, where Indian languages and cultures were prohibited. Policies of diversity and limited sovereignty were adopted. The Grant administration is universally regarded as inept in Indian affairs as well as have been rife with corruption. Although Morgan contributed to the ideology of assimilation, he escaped accountability for the results.

===Later career===
Having failed to become Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Morgan applied for various ambassadorships under the Grant administration, including to China and Peru. Grant&#x27;s administration rejected all the applications, after which Morgan resolved to visit Europe on his own with a professional as well as a personal agenda.

For one year, 1870–71, the three Morgans went on a grand tour of Europe. During his European travels, Morgan met Charles Darwin and the great British anthropologists of the age. He visited Sir John Lubbock, who had coined the words &quot;Paleolithic&quot; and &quot;Neolithic&quot;, and used the terms &quot;barbarians&quot; and &quot;savages&quot; in his own studies of the three-age system. Morgan adopted these terms, but with an altered sense, in &quot;Ancient Society&quot;. Lubbock was using modern ethnology as he knew it to reconstruct the ways of human ancestors. Lubbock&#x27;s main works had already been published by the time of Morgan&#x27;s visit. Morgan recorded his European travel and contacts in a journal of several volumes. Extracts were published in 1937 by Leslie White.

He continued with his independent scholarship, never becoming affiliated with any university, although he associated with university presidents and the leading ethnologists looked up to him as a founder of the field. He was an intellectual mentor to those who followed, including John Wesley Powell, who became head of the Bureau of Ethnology in 1879 at the Smithsonian Institution. Morgan was consulted by the highest levels of government on appointments and other ethnological matters. In 1878 he conducted one final field trip, leading a small party in search of native ruins in the American Southwest. They were the first to describe the Aztec ruins on the Animas River but missed discovering Mesa Verde.

===Death and legacy===
In 1879 Morgan completed two construction projects. One was his library, an addition to the house he had purchased with Mary many years before and where he died in December 1881. He combined the opening of the library with a celebration of the 25th anniversary of The club. It included a dinner for 40 persons, who were by that time the leading lights of Rochester. The library acquired some fame as a local monument. Pictures were taken and published. The Club only met there one other time, however, at Morgan&#x27;s funeral in 1881. The second building project was a mausoleum for his daughters in Mount Hope Cemetery. It became the resting place of the entire remainder of the family, starting with Lewis.

His wife survived him by two years. They both left wills. A nephew of Lewis moved to Rochester with his family and took up residence in the house to care for Lewis&#x27; and Mary&#x27;s son. On the son&#x27;s death 20 years later, the entire estate reverted to the University of Rochester, which by the terms of the wills was to use the funds for the endowment of a college for women, dedicated as a memorial to the Morgan daughters. The nephew attempted to break the wills on his behalf but lost the case in the state supreme court. The house with the library survived into mid-20th-century, when it was demolished to make way for a highway bypass system. Materials relating to Morgan&#x27;s writings are held in a special collection at the University of Rochester library.

====Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture====
The Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture is a distinguished lecture held annually by the Department of Anthropology at the University of Rochester. Begun in 1963, the lectures honor the career and seminal research of American anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan. Many of the lectures have been published, including the inaugural one by South African anthropologist Meyer Fortes.

===Work in ethnology===

In the 1840s, Morgan had befriended the young Ely S. Parker of the Seneca tribe and the Tonawanda Reservation. With a classical missionary education, Parker went on to study law. With his help, Morgan studied the culture and the structure of Iroquois society. Morgan had noticed they used different terms than Europeans to designate individuals by their relationships within the extended family. He had the creative insight to recognize this was meaningful in terms of their social organization. He defined European terms as &quot;descriptive&quot; and Iroquois (and Native American) terms as &quot;classificatory&quot;, terms that continue to be used as major divisions by anthropologists and ethnographers.

Based on his research enabled by Parker, Morgan and Parker wrote and published &quot;The League of the Ho-dé-no-sau-nee or Iroquois&quot; (1851). Morgan dedicated the book to Parker (who was then 23) and &quot;our joint researches&quot;. In subsequent publications of the book Parker&#x27;s name was omitted. This work presented the complexity of Iroquois society in a path-breaking ethnography that was a model for future anthropologists, as Morgan presented the kinship system of the Iroquois with unprecedented nuance.

Morgan expanded his research far beyond the Iroquois. Although Benjamin Barton had posited Asian origins for Native Americans as early as 1797, in the mid-nineteenth century, other American and European scholars still supported widely varying ideas, including a theory they were one of the lost tribes of Israel, because of the strong influence of biblical and classical conceptions of history. Morgan had begun to theorize the Native Americans originated in Asia. He thought he could prove it by a broad study of kinship terms used by people in Asia as well as tribes in North America.

He wanted to provide evidence for monogenesis, the theory that all human beings descend from a common source (as opposed to polygenism).

In the late 1850s and 1860s, Morgan collected kinship data from a variety of Native American tribes. In his quest to do comparative kinship studies, Morgan also corresponded with scholars, missionaries, US Indian agents, colonial agents, and military officers around the world. He created a questionnaire which others could complete so he could collect data in a standardized way. Over several years, he made months-long trips across the Old West to further his research.

With the help of local contacts and, after intensive correspondence over the course of years, Morgan analyzed his data and wrote his seminal &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot; (1871), which was printed by the Smithsonian Press. It &quot;created at a stroke what without exaggeration might be called the seminal concern of contemporary anthropology, the study of kinship ...&quot; In this work, Morgan set forth his argument for the unity of humankind. At the same time, he presented a sophisticated schema of social evolution based upon the relationship terms, the categories of kinship, used by peoples around the world. Through his analysis of kinship terms, Morgan discerned that the structure of the family and social institutions develop and change according to a specific sequence.

===Theory of social evolution===
This original theory became less relevant because of the Darwinian revolution, which demonstrated how change happens over time. In addition, Morgan became increasingly interested in the comparative study of kinship (family) relations as a window into understanding larger social dynamics. He saw kinship relations as a basic part of society. Morgan viewed society as a living system that changes over time.

In the years that followed, Morgan developed his theories. Combined with an exhaustive study of classic Greek and Roman sources, he crowned his work with his &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;Ancient Society&quot; (1877). Morgan elaborated upon his theory of social evolution. He introduced a critical link between social progress and technological progress. He emphasized the centrality of family and property relations. He traced the interplay between the evolution of technology, of family relations, of property relations, of the larger social structures and systems of governance, and intellectual development.

Looking across an expanded span of human existence, Morgan presented three major stages: savagery, barbarism, and civilization. He divided and defined the stages by technological inventions, such as use of fire, bow, pottery in the savage era; domestication of animals, agriculture, and metalworking in the barbarian era; and development of the alphabet and writing in the civilization era. In part, this was an effort to create a structure for North American history that was comparable to the three-age system of European pre-history, which had been developed as an evidence-based system by the Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen in the 1830s; his work (Guideline to Scandinavian Antiquity) was published in English in 1848. The concept of evidence-based chronological dating received wider notice in English-speaking nations as developed by J. J. A. Worsaae, whose &quot;The Primeval Antiquities of Denmark&quot; was published in English in 1849.

Initially Morgan&#x27;s work was accepted as integral to American history, but later it was treated as a separate category of anthropology. Henry Adams wrote of &quot;Ancient Society&quot; that it &quot;must become the foundation of all future work in American historical science.&quot; The historian Francis Parkman also was a fan, but later nineteenth-century historians pushed Native American history to the side of the American story.

Morgan&#x27;s final work, &quot;Houses and House-life of the American Aborigines&quot; (1881), was an elaboration on what he had originally planned as an additional part of &quot;Ancient Society&quot;. In it, Morgan presented evidence, mostly from North and South America, that the development of house architecture and house culture reflected the development of kinship and property relations.

Although many specific aspects of Morgan&#x27;s evolutionary position have been rejected by later anthropologists, his real achievements remain impressive. He founded the sub-discipline of kinship studies. Anthropologists remain interested in the connections which Morgan outlined between material culture and social structure. His impact has been felt far beyond the Ivory Tower.

Morgan was not quite the social reformer some would believe him to be. Outraged at the manipulations of the Ogden Land Company to get possession of the Tonawanda Seneca Reservation, Morgan exerted some effort in behalf of the natives, but not nearly as much or to such effect as is generally supposed. Most of his effort seems to have been limited to a few months in 1846, and the issue was not settled until 1857, more than ten years later. The natives&#x27; principal legal counsel in these years was not Morgan, but John Martindale. Morgan&#x27;s role, such as it was, was that of citizen activist. Then, too, although a champion of the Native Americans, Morgan was not an advocate of cultural pluralism nor did he work for &quot;cultural survival.&quot; The Indian, Morgan exhorted his fellow citizens, ought to be rescued &quot;from his impending destiny,&quot; &quot;reclaimed and civilized, and thus saved eventually from the fate which has already befallen so many of our aboriginal races&quot; by education and Christianity.

===Influence on Marxism===
In 1881, Karl Marx started reading Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Society&quot;, thus beginning Morgan&#x27;s posthumous influence among European thinkers. Friedrich Engels also read his work after Morgan&#x27;s death. Although Marx never finished his own book based on Morgan&#x27;s work, Engels continued his analysis. Morgan&#x27;s work on the social structure and material culture strongly influenced Engels&#x27; sociological theory of dialectical materialism (expressed in his work &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State&quot;, 1884). Scholars of the Communist bloc considered Morgan as the preeminent anthropologist. Morgan&#x27;s work has led some to believe that early communist-like societies existed in Native American society. However, the belief of primitive communism as based on Morgan&#x27;s work is flawed due to Morgan&#x27;s misunderstandings of Haudenosaunee society and his since disproved theory of social evolution. This, and subsequent more accurate research, has led the society of the Haudenosaunee to be of interest in communist and anarchist analysis, particularly societal aspects where land was not treated as a commodity, communal ownership and near non-existent rates of crime.

<text>The Intercolonial Railway of Canada , also referred to as the Intercolonial Railway (ICR), was a historic Canadian railway that operated from 1872 to 1918, when it became part of Canadian National Railways. As the railway was also completely owned and controlled by the Government of Canada, the Intercolonial was also one of Canada&#x27;s first Crown corporations.

==Origins==
The idea of a railway connecting Britain&#x27;s North American colonies arose as soon as the railway age began in the 1830s. In the decades following the War of 1812 and ever-mindful of the issue of security, the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada (later the Province of Canada after 1840) wished to improve land-based transportation with the Atlantic coast colonies of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and to a lesser extent Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. A railway connection from the Province of Canada to the British colonies on the coast would serve a vital military purpose during the winter months when the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River were frozen and shipping was impossible, but it would similarly serve an economic purpose for the Maritimes by opening up year-round access to new markets.

Significant surveys were conducted throughout the 1830s–1850s. Several rival routes emerged: a southern, a central, and a northern route. In 1849, Major William Robinson recommended the northern route as most secure from American attack. Funding talks were established between the various colonial administrations and the British government, but progress remained slow and little was accomplished beyond talk.

==Pre-Confederation components==
Railway construction came to the Maritime provinces as early as the mid-1830s with the opening of the Albion Railway, a coal mining railway in Nova Scotia&#x27;s Pictou County and the second railway to open in British North America. Construction in the 1850s saw two important rail lines opened in the Maritimes to connect cities on the Atlantic coast with steamship routes in the Northumberland Strait and the Gulf of St. Lawrence:

* The Nova Scotia Railway (NSR) was built in stages between the Atlantic port of Halifax north to Truro, and northeast to industrial Pictou County, those being the towns of Westville, Stellarton, New Glasgow, Trenton, and the Northumberland Strait port town of Pictou. Pictou soon became an important ferry port for steamships servicing Prince Edward Island. The NSR also built northwest from Halifax to the town of Windsor, a port on the Bay of Fundy and gateway to the agricultural hinterland of Nova Scotia&#x27;s Annapolis Valley.
* The European and North American Railway (E&amp;NA) was a line that was envisioned to extend the New England rail network eastward through the Maritimes to an ice free harbour closer to the shipping routes to Europe. The first portion of the E&amp;NA built was between the Bay of Fundy port city of Saint John, via &quot;The Bend&quot; (of the Petitcodiac River, this area is today known as the city of Moncton) to the Northumberland Strait port town of Shediac. The Saint John–Shediac line opened on August 20, 1857, and eventually other companies built separate sections of railway linking Saint John west through Maine to the New England network, however the E&amp;NA remained solely a Saint John–Shediac connection, with a number of minor feeder lines, and never reached a port in Nova Scotia.

An intercolonial rail system in the British North American colonies was never far from the minds of government and civic leaders and in an 1851 speech at a Mason&#x27;s Hall in Halifax, local editor of the &quot;Novascotian&quot;, Joseph Howe spoke these words:

I am neither a prophet, nor the son of a prophet, yet I will venture to predict that in five years we shall make the journey hence to Quebec and Montreal, and home through Portland and St. John, by rail; and I believe that many in this room will live to hear the whistle of the steam engine in the passes of the Rocky Mountains, and to make the journey from Halifax to the Pacific in five or six days.

But a rail connection between the Maritime colonies and the Province of Canada was not to be for another quarter century. Central Canada&#x27;s dominant railway player in the 1850s was the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) and its profit-driven business model chose the U.S. Atlantic port of Portland, Maine, over a much longer journey to a Maritime port. As a result, Portland boomed during the winter months when Montreal&#x27;s shipping season was closed.

==Confederation==
Nevertheless, the geopolitical instability in North America resulting from the American Civil War led to increased nervousness on the part of British North American colonies, particularly wary of the large Union Army operating south of their borders. The demands for closer political and economic ties between colonies led to further calls for an &quot;Intercolonial Railway&quot;. An 1862 conference in Quebec City led to an agreement on financing the railway with the Maritime colonies and Canada splitting construction costs and Britain assuming any debts, but the deal fell through within months.

It is speculated that this failure to achieve a deal on the Intercolonial in 1862, combined with the ongoing concerns over the American Civil War, led to the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, and eventually to Confederation of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (Ontario and Quebec) in 1867.

Section 145 of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; created a constitutional requirement for the federal government to build established the Intercolonial Railway:

:&quot;145. Inasmuch as the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have joined in a Declaration that the Construction of the Intercolonial Railway is essential to the Consolidation of the Union of British North America, and to the Assent thereto of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and have consequently agreed that Provision should be made for its immediate Construction by the Government of Canada; Therefore, in order to give effect to that Agreement, it shall be the Duty of the Government and Parliament of Canada to provide for the commencement, within Six Months after the Union, of a Railway connecting the River St. Lawrence with the City of Halifax in Nova Scotia, and for the Construction thereof without Intermission, and the Completion thereof with all practicable Speed.&quot;

Despite being enshrined in the BNA Act of 1867, it would still be another decade before a route was finally selected and construction was completed; however, as a start, the federal government assumed the operations of the NSR and E&amp;NA which were to be wholly absorbed into the ICR. The route connecting the NSR and the E&amp;NA was not contestable as the line had to cross the Cobequid Mountains and the Isthmus of Chignecto where options were limited by the local topography. In New Brunswick, it was a different story, as the choice was narrowed to three options. A commission of engineers, headed by Sandford Fleming had been unanimously appointed in 1863 to consider the following:

* The &quot;Frontier Route&quot;—surveyed in 1836 by Captain Yule (Royal Engineers) from Saint John, via Fredericton, up the Saint John River valley to Canada East, not far from the International Boundary which had been recently decided in favour of the United States during the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842.
* The &quot;Central Route&quot;—surveyor unknown, running north from a point near Sussex, passing near Grand Lake, and north to Canada East.
* The &quot;Chaleur Bay Route&quot;—surveyed in the 1840s by Major Robinson (Royal Engineers), running from &quot;The Bend&quot; (Moncton), north to Newcastle on the Miramichi River, Bathurst and Campbellton, to Canada East. It would cross the Gaspé Peninsula using the Matapédia River valley Kempt Road before heading up the St. Lawrence River valley to the rail connection with the GTR at Rivière-du-Loup.

Despite pressure from commercial interests in the Maritimes and New England who wanted a rail connection closer to the border, the Chaleur Bay routing was chosen, amid the backdrop of the American Civil War, as it would keep the Intercolonial far from the boundary with Maine.

==Construction==
Fleming was appointed &quot;engineer in chief&quot; of the ICR project by the federal government. The majority of the construction was to be tendered to local contractors, with engineering oversight to be provided by Fleming&#x27;s staff, however political interference and contractor negligence (or incompetence) led to escalating costs on some of the contracts, forcing Fleming to assume some of the direct contractor duties as violators were discovered and purged from the project.

Perhaps the greatest case of cost overruns was caused by political interference during construction of the section of new line between the NSR trackage at Truro and the E&amp;NA trackage near Moncton. This resulted in several diversions from the most direct route:

* From Debert to the Wentworth Valley running a circuitous route known as &quot;The Grecian Bend&quot; through the iron mining community of Londonderry on the southern slope of the Cobequid Mountains. An iron trestle was required to cross the Folly River and to this day the diversion adds 5 kilometres to the mainline.
* From Oxford to Amherst, running near the coal mining community of Springhill, along the northern slope of the Cobequid Mountains.
* The section running from the interprovincial boundary at the Missaguash River near the town of Amherst to Moncton was diverted further west to run into the Memramcook River valley to service the village of Dorchester at the insistence of an influential politician, A. J. Smith. The alignment is known as the &quot;Dorchester Diversion&quot;.

To Fleming&#x27;s credit, he insisted upon a high quality of workmanship in designing the route, using fills several metres higher than the surrounding landscape, where possible, to prevent snow accumulation, and mandated the installation of iron bridges over streams and rivers rather than the cheaper wooden structures that many railways of the time favoured. This latter decision proved extremely far-sighted as the strength of the bridges and their material saved the line from lengthy closures on numerous occasions in the early years during forest fire seasons. The scale of construction on the Intercolonial made it the biggest Canadian public works project of the 19th century.

Sections of the railway opened as follows:

* Truro to Moncton in November 1872. A major obstacle involved crossing the Cobequid Mountains with the Intercolonial&#x27;s route running through the &quot;Folly Gap&quot;, also known as the Wentworth Valley.
* Rivière-du-Loup to Ste-Flavie (now Mont-Joli) in August 1874. This portion of the route is entirely in the lower St. Lawrence River valley.
* Moncton to Campbellton in 1875. A major obstacle involved bridging the northwest and southwest branches of the Miramichi River near their confluence at Newcastle.
* Campbellton to Ste-Flavie on July 1, 1876. The main obstacle involved running the line through the Matapedia River valley where deep cuts would prove to be a problem for years during the winter months. Problems with clearing snow in some of these areas were resolved with the construction of extensive snow sheds—the only ones in eastern Canada.

The ICR was initially built to broad gauge of to be compatible with other railways in British North America, namely its component systems, the NSR and the E&amp;NA, as well as its western connection at Rivière-du-Loup, the GTR. Before the construction was even complete, Fleming had the ICR re-gauged to standard gauge in 1875, following the trend of standardization sweeping U.S. and Canadian railways at the time.

==Operation and expansion==

In 1879, the ICR purchased the GTR line between Rivière-du-Loup and Levis, opposite from Quebec City. This line had been completed in 1860 by the GTR, and the ICR had had running rights on it since 1876.

The main line of the ICR competed directly with the steamship service of the Quebec &amp; Gulf Ports Steamship Company, which was reorganized in 1880 as the Quebec Steamship Company. By the late 1880s, this concern operated only one steamer, the &quot;Miramichi,&quot; between Quebec and Pictou; all of its other vessels had been shifted to service between New York and the West Indies.

In 1884, the ICR built a branch from its mainline east of Campbellton to service the port and forest industry town of Dalhousie.

At Rivière du Loup, in the 1880s the ICR made connections with the steamers of the St. Lawrence Steam Navigation Company. This steamship line was absorbed by the Richelieu &amp; Ontario Navigation Company in 1886.

In the late 1880s, the ICR received running rights over the GTR main line between Levis and Montreal (via Richmond), allowing passengers and cargo from the Maritimes to Canada&#x27;s then-largest city to transit without interchanging.

In 1887 the ICR took over and completed construction of a line running from Oxford Junction to Stellarton, along Nova Scotia shores of the Northumberland Strait. This line was known as the &quot;Short Line&quot; and it provided an alternate route for ICR trains heading to Pictou County and Cape Breton Island from New Brunswick.

The Temiscouata Railway was completed in 1889 from Rivière du Loup to Edmundston, New Brunswick, giving the ICR a connection with the Canadian Pacific line up the St. John Valley.

In 1890, the ICR completed construction of what had begun as the Cape Breton Eastern Extension Railway, with a line running from its former NSR terminus at New Glasgow eastward through Antigonish to the port of Mulgrave where a railcar ferry service was instituted over a route across the deep waters of the Strait of Canso to Point Tupper. The line then headed east across the centre of Cape Breton Island, crossing the Bras d&#x27;Or Lake on the newly built Grand Narrows Bridge, continuing to the port of North Sydney (with ferry and steamship connections to Port aux Basques, Newfoundland) and terminating in the burgeoning industrial centre and port of Sydney.

In 1899, the Department of Railways and Canals purchased the Drummond County Railway from James Naismith Greenshields and folded it into the ICR to provide the railway with a direct route from Sainte-Rosalie (east of Saint-Hyacinthe where it met the GTR main line) to Lévis. After this purchase was complete, the ICR stopped using the GTR&#x27;s route via Richmond.

The ICR opened a branch of on June 22, 1903, between Rivière Ouelle Station and Pointe St. Denis on the South Shore of the St. Lawrence. In 1904 the ferry &quot;Champlain&quot; entered service between Pointe St. Denis and the North Shore ports of St. Irenée, Murray Bay and Cap à l&#x27;Aigle.

Also in 1904, the ICR purchased the Canada Eastern Railway, giving it a connection to the Fredericton area.

Moncton became the headquarters for the company and extensive shops and yard facilities were built, as well as a grand station, built to rival the Canadian Pacific Railway station in McAdam. Following a February 24, 1906 fire, the Moncton shops were rebuilt at a new location at the insistence of the local Member of Parliament, Henry Emmerson, who was the Minister of Railways and Canals in Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s cabinet. The replacement shops were built northwest of downtown while the former shops location was converted into yard facilities. Both Rivière-du-Loup and Campbellton had unsuccessfully lobbied to become the new headquarters of the ICR following the Moncton fire.

As a result of the ICR with its subsidized freight-rate agreements, as well as the National Policy of prime minister John A. Macdonald, the industrial revolution struck Maritime towns quickly. The ICR was the perfect vehicle for transporting raw ore such as iron ore and coal to steel plants in Trenton, Sydney Mines and Sydney, as well as finished and semi-finished products to other Maritime and central Canadian locations. This led to foundries and factories of various industries springing up throughout Nova Scotia and New Brunswick along the ICR main line and branch lines.

==Passenger trains==

Passenger trains on the ICR operated between all points on the system which included the following major sections:
* Halifax–Truro
* Truro – Pictou County – Sydney
* Truro–Moncton
* Saint John – Moncton
* Moncton–Newcastle–Bathurst–Campbellton–Rivière-du-Loup–Lévis–Montreal

Several &quot;name trains&quot; were started by the ICR, including the &quot;Maritime Express&quot; and the longest-enduring &quot;name&quot; passenger train in Canada to this very day, the &quot;Ocean Limited&quot;.

ICR passenger trains also connected with steamship services to Prince Edward Island at Shediac and Pictou, steamship services to Quebec at Pictou, steamship services to the United States and Europe at Halifax and Saint John, provided railcar ferries to Cape Breton Island, and steamship services operated by the Newfoundland Railway to Newfoundland at North Sydney.

==First World War==
As a government-owned railway and the only operator of a rail connection to the port of Halifax and the extensive defence establishment there, the ICR became a lifeline for the Canadian and British war effort throughout the First World War, particularly since as the CPR line to Saint John ran through the state of Maine on its eastward route from Montreal, thereby any war shipments on CPR would violate the United States&#x27; neutrality.

Halifax grew in importance, particularly as Germany introduced use of submarines for the first time to a large-scale conflict, requiring the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Navy to institute the use of convoys for protecting ships. Halifax&#x27;s protected harbour allowed ships to load and form up into convoy formations under protection due to torpedo nets strung across the harbour entrance. The ICR swelled in its ranks of employees and equipment as it struggled to carry the burden of military supplies from central Canada to the Atlantic coast. After 1915, the busy wartime railway officially operated under the name Canadian Government Railways but continued to be widely known as the Intercolonial. An equally important connection was the line from Cape Breton where the largest private employer in Canada, the Dominion Steel and Coal Company (through its predecessors) produced vast quantities of steel and coal for the war effort, much of which was carried by the ICR westward to other industrial centres, before returning via Halifax for shipment overseas.

The tragedy of the Halifax Explosion on December 6, 1917, played havoc with much of the ICR&#x27;s infrastructure in the Richmond neighbourhood of north-end Halifax. The ICR&#x27;s North Street station was heavily damaged and its Richmond Yard and shipping terminals were destroyed or rendered unusable. Hundreds of freight cars were destroyed and dozens of passenger and military hospital cars were heavily damaged. Many ICR employees, most notably train dispatcher Vincent Coleman, responded with heroism and desperate determination to evacuate wounded and summon relief. The explosion severely but only briefly hampered war-time operations at the port. The railway mobilized repair crews from across Eastern Canada to clear debris with remarkable speed and resumed its full schedule five days after the explosion, albeit with diminished passengers cars as many were severely damaged. Wharves and freight facilities were rebuilt for wartime service within a month. Construction that had begun on a second route using a vast rock cut through the south end of the Halifax peninsula to a new &quot;Ocean Terminal&quot; was accelerated. The ICR repaired the North Street Station to serve for another year but switched passenger service to a new south end station near the present day Halifax railway station in January 1919.

==Herald and reporting marks==

For most of its history the Intercolonial reporting mark was ICR, but was changed to IRC during the First World War. Intercolonial publications, newspaper reports and popular usage used ICR. The railway&#x27;s logo was a large bull moose herald, part of a campaign to promote hunting and fishing tourism traffic. It appeared on many promotional publications but seldom appeared on rolling stock.

==Legacy==
The ICR was Canada&#x27;s first national railway (although some might argue the case for the GTR), having pre-dated the CPR by nine years, and it was also the first significant Crown corporation. The ICR was a pervasive and ubiquitous presence in the Maritimes, with the company employing thousands of workers, purchasing millions of dollars in services, coal, and other local products annually, operating ferries to Cape Breton Island at the Strait of Canso, and carrying the Royal Mail. The IRC was the face of the federal government in many communities in a region that was still somewhat hostile to what many believed was a forced Confederation (anti-Confederation organizers remained active in Nova Scotia and particularly New Brunswick into the 1880s).

In 1915 the ICR, together with the federally-owned National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) and the Prince Edward Island Railway (PEIR), as well as several bankrupt or defunct shortlines in New Brunswick, were grouped under the collective banner of the Canadian Government Railways (CGR) for funding and administrative purposes, although each company continued to operate independently.

On September 6, 1918, the bankrupt Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) was nationalized by the Borden government, as part of a three-year long programme of re-organization of Canadian railways by Minister of Railways and Canals John Dowsley Reid. The CNoR&#x27;s government-appointed Board of Management was directed to assume control of the CGR system at this time. On December 20, 1918, Reid consolidated the management of the various companies by creating the Canadian National Railways (CNR), by means of an order issued by the Privy Council. Another bankrupt western railway system, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR), was nationalized by the federal government on March 7, 1919, and became part of the CNR system on July 12, 1920. GTPR&#x27;s parent company, the GTR was also nationalized on May 21, 1920, before being included in the CNR system on January 30, 1923.

The ICR had been called the &quot;People&#x27;s Railway&quot; and this slogan was similarly applied to the CNR for a period.

Despite many claims of political interference in its construction and subsequent operation, the majority of IRC from an operations viewpoint remained economically self-sufficient. This was largely because ICR balance books never had to contend with falling freight and passenger revenues as a result of post-Second World War highway construction and airline usage. During the 42-year life of the ICR from 1876 to 1918, the railway had grown to a monopoly position in land transportation.

Following its demise in 1918, the ICR trackage and facilities formed the majority of CNR&#x27;s Maritimes operations and CN (acronym abbreviated post-1960) maintained Moncton as its principal regional headquarters well into the 1980s. Until the late-1970s, the ICR line through northern New Brunswick and eastern Quebec continued to host a large portion of CN&#x27;s freight and the majority of its passenger traffic to Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland.

In 1976, a &quot;cutoff&quot; was built from Pelletier, Quebec, to a point on the former ICR main line west of Rivière-du-Loup, eliminating of mountainous trackage on the former NTR to Quebec City. Following this development, the majority of freight traffic to the Maritimes shifted to the NTR&#x27;s line through central New Brunswick, relegating the ICR line east of Rivière-du-Loup to secondary main line status.

Following CN&#x27;s privatization in 1995, the company undertook a network rationalization program which made the IRC line between Moncton and Rivière-du-Loup, along with its trackage on the Gaspé Peninsula, redundant and it was sold in 1998 to short line operator Quebec Railway Corporation which operated for a time the New Brunswick East Coast Railway and associated subsidiaries. The ICR line from Truro to Sydney was sold to a short line operator, the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway, in 1993.

The former ICR main line from Sainte-Rosalie to Charny and the east end of Lévis to Rivière-du-Loup, as well as the ICR lines from Moncton to Saint John and Moncton to Halifax remain in operation under CN. A short section on the waterfront of Lévis was abandoned on October 24, 1998, due to network rationalization, resulting in the CN main line between Charny and the east end of Levis running on former NTR trackage.

Despite the replacement or upgrading of bridges and track since the 19th century, almost the entirety of Fleming&#x27;s route continues to operate; its fills and rock cuts and iron bridges, once considered extravagant, remain much as they were when they were built.

Via Rail continues to operate the &quot;Ocean&quot; passenger train between Halifax and Montreal following the entire route of the ICR the entire way except for the waterfront section in Levis.

Former ICR stations in Lévis and Pictou have been designated as National Historic Sites of Canada, as well as the Joffre Roundhouse constructed by the ICR in Charny. The establishment of the ICR has been designated a National Historic Event.

<text>Bevo is the live mascot of the athletic programs at the University of Texas at Austin. Bevo was originally known as “Varsity” and the Texas A&amp;M song about UT, mentions Varsity as the name of the UT Longhorn mascot. Bevo is a Texas Longhorn steer with burnt orange and white coloring from which the university derived its color scheme. The profile of the Longhorn&#x27;s head and horns gives rise to the school&#x27;s hand symbol and saying, &quot;Hook &#x27;em Horns&quot;. The most recent Bevo, Bevo XV, was introduced to Texas football fans on September 4, 2016. His predecessor, Bevo XIV, died of cancer on October 16, 2015. Bevo XV is owned by Betty and John Baker&#x27;s Sunrise Ranch in Liberty Hill, Texas; Sunrise Ranch also owned Bevo XV&#x27;s predecessors Bevo XIII and Bevo XIV.

==History==

The idea to use a live longhorn as the university&#x27;s mascot is attributed to UT alumnus Stephen Pinckney in 1916. Pinckney gathered $124 from other alumni to purchase a steer in the Texas Panhandle, which they originally named &quot;Bo&quot; and shipped to Austin.

A Longhorn steer was not the original mascot of the University of Texas. The original mascot was actually an American Pit Bull Terrier named &quot;Pig&quot;.

===Lineage===

There have been fifteen Bevos to date. Bevo was originally named &quot;Bo&quot; but came to be called Bevo soon after his first appearance at Texas&#x27; 1916 Thanksgiving Day game. After the game, Ben Dyer (the campus magazine editor) declared, &quot;His name is Bevo, and long may he reign!&quot; Ben Dyer died before stating why he chose the name Bevo, but there are three theories. The first is that Bevo was named after an amber colored non-alcoholic beverage named Bevo (which, coincidentally, was introduced in 1916), and the other is that the name is derived from beeves, the plural form of beef. One popular theory is that Cadets from Texas A&amp;M stole the mascot to brand 13 – 0, which was the score the Aggies had won by the year before. Faced with that dilemma some UT student suggested combining the 1 and 3 to create a B, made an E out of the -, added a V, kept the 0 to create BEVO. However, this theory is not correct as Bevo was named months before the branding actually happened.

The longest reigning Bevo was Bevo XIII, which was supplied to the university by John T. Baker, owner of the Sunrise Ranch in Liberty Hill, Texas. Baker is past president of the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America and serves as a judge in its competitions. Bevo XIII, originally named Sunrise Express, was a champion steer at the age of 3, before becoming the UT mascot. Bevo XIII became the mascot in 1988 and served 16 seasons on the sideline. He presided over 191 UT football games and attended the first inauguration of President George W. Bush in 2001. During his tenure, he presided over four (1990, 1994, 1995, 1996) conference football championships and a Heisman Trophy award for Ricky Williams. Bevo XIII was the winningest Bevo in UT history, and was replaced by youth grand champion Sunrise Studly, becoming Bevo XIV, at the September 4, 2004 football game versus the University of North Texas. It was the only time that two Bevos have ever appeared at the same football game. Bevo XIII was returned to Baker&#x27;s ranch where he lived out the rest of his days in peace. Bevo XIII died on October 9, 2006, due to heart failure.

Bevo XIV attended George W. Bush&#x27;s second inauguration in January 2005. He also attended the 2005 Rose Bowl win over Michigan as well as the 2006 Rose Bowl game in which the Longhorns won the 2005–2006 National Championship over USC. , Bevo XIV weighed , stood , and his horns measured tip-to-tip. His birthday was April 8. At the 2008 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, he took home the honors of Reserve Grand Champion.

On October 13, 2015, it was announced that Bevo XIV retired after contracting bovine leukemia virus. He died on October 16, 2015.

On September 3, 2016, a young 19-month-old Bevo XV was unveiled at a special 100 year anniversary event at the University of Texas at Austin, celebrating 100 years of a live Bevo mascot.

== Mishaps by Bevo affecting others ==
Bevo II once charged an SMU cheerleader, who had to defend himself with his megaphone. Bevo III escaped from his enclosure and ran loose across campus for 2 days. Bevo IV once attacked a parked car, while Bevo V broke loose and scattered the Baylor band. Bevo XV broke free of handlers during the January 1, 2019 Sugar Bowl, scattering reporters as he almost reached the University of Georgia mascot Uga X, an English bulldog.

==Public appearances and traditions==

Bevo is one of the most recognized college mascots and has even been called &quot;the toughest-looking animal mascot in sports&quot;.

Bevo makes appearances at almost all home football games of the University of Texas, as well as many away games. He also typically makes appearances at important pep rallies, such as the ones in the weeks before the games against Texas A&amp;M and Oklahoma. Following commencement ceremonies, he is typically on hand for photographs with graduates and their families.

Since 1945, the care of Bevo during his transportation and appearances has been entrusted to an honorary organization of undergraduate students called the Silver Spurs. Bevo rides in a special burnt orange livestock trailer with his name on the side.

Bevo is a steer, as an intact bull might be too dangerous in a crowded environment like a stadium. In 2002, an alumni group proposed that Bevo be given neuticles to &quot;increase his masculinity&quot;.

During football games, he typically stands or sits placidly behind one of the end zones (the south end zone in Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium) and is occasionally greeted by UT players when they score touchdowns. Bred to be docile, he is riled only in the most extreme of circumstances.

On the morning of December 25, 2014, Christmas Day, Longhorn Network aired a five-hour-long, &quot;yule log&quot;-styled special featuring footage of Bevo XIV at a ranch set to Christmas music.

<doc id="461573" wikidata="Q6151200" url="?curid=461573" title="USS Copahee">
<text>USS &quot;Copahee&quot; (CVE-12) was a that served in the United States Navy during World War II. Originally classified AVG-12, was changed to ACV-12, 20 August 1942; CVE-12, 15 July 1943; and CVHE-12, 12 June 1955.

She was laid down on 18 June 1941, as &quot;Steel Architect&quot;, under Maritime Commission contract (hull 169) in Tacoma, Washington by Todd Pacific Shipyards, launched 21 October 1941; sponsored by Mrs. W. M. Wells; acquired by the United States Navy on 8 February 1942; and commissioned 15 June 1942, Commander J. G. Farrell in command.

==Service history==
Sailing from Alameda 5 September 1942, &quot;Copahee&quot; arrived at Nouméa 28 September with her cargo of planes, stores and passengers. From 7 October to 11 October, she cruised toward Guadalcanal to launch 20 Marine fighter planes and 18 SBD-3s of VMSB-141 for Henderson Field, then returned to San Diego, California 29 October for overhaul.

After training at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Copahee&quot; sailed to San Diego, arriving 25 February 1943 to begin transport duty carrying aircraft, aviation stores and personnel to the forward bases in the New Hebrides, Fijis, and New Caledonia as well as islands in the Hawaiian chain, departing San Diego on 10 March 1943 until 7 June 1943.

Between 2 September 1943 and 19 January 1944, she made two voyages to deliver aircraft at Townsville and Brisbane, Australia, and one to Pearl Harbor. She sailed from San Diego 10 April to ferry aircraft from Pearl Harbor to Majuro until 3 June, when she began supporting the Marianas operation by supplying replacement pilots and aircraft to carriers of the 5th Fleet. On 28 July 1944, she returned to San Diego, California with a load of captured Japanese planes (13 Mitsubishi A6M Zeros and 1 Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot;) and equipment (37 engines) to be used for intelligence and training purposes.

After overhaul, &quot;Copahee&quot; returned to transport duty. Until the end of the war she made six voyages from Alameda, carrying her vital cargo to Manus, Majuro, Guam, Saipan, and Pearl Harbor. From 6 September to 21 December 1945, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, returning homeward-bound servicemen from Saipan, Guam, Eniwetok, and the Philippines to the west coast. She returned to Alameda 21 December 1945, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Tacoma, Washington, 5 July 1946.

&quot;Copahee&quot; was redesignated as a helicopter escort carrier (CVHE-12) on 12 June 1955. Stricken for disposal on 1 March 1959, &quot;Copahee&quot; was sold for scrap in 1961.

==Awards==
&quot;Copahee&quot; received one battle star for World War II service.

&quot;Bargainville&quot; was successful in Canada, debuting at No. 7 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Albums Chart. The album sold more than 50,000 copies within two weeks. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Stuck in the 90&#x27;s&quot;, peaked at No. 13 on Canada&#x27;s singles chart. The album was certified Platinum in Canada in 1994.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; noted that at times &quot;vocals blend into pop perfection, conjuring up sonic images of the Beach Boys doing the soundtrack for a 1960s European road flick.&quot; The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; praised &quot;the clever way they mix folkish rhythms and mellow acoustics with their sentimental lyrics.&quot;

<doc id="461582" wikidata="Q636944" url="?curid=461582" title="War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II">
<text>Around six million Polish citizens are estimated to have perished during World War II. Most were civilians killed by the actions of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, the Lithuanian Security Police, as well as the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and its offshoots (the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, the Self-defense Kushch Units and the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army).

At the International Military Tribunal held in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1945–46, three categories of wartime criminality were juridically established: waging a war of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity. For the first time in history, these three categories of crimes were defined after the end of the war in international law as violations of fundamental human values and norms, regardless of internal (local) law or the obligation to follow superior orders. In subsequent years, the crime of genocide was elevated to a distinct, fourth category.

These crimes were committed in occupied Poland on a tremendous scale, unparalleled elsewhere in Europe.

==German-Soviet partitioning of Poland and cooperation (September 1939 – June 1941)==


Following 1 September 1939 invasion of Poland from the west by Germany, the Soviets attacked from the east on 17 September in accordance with the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a secret non-aggression agreement signed in August. Within a month, Poland had been divided between two occupational forces, and their joint victory parade was held in Brest-Litovsk. Germany annexed 91,902 square kilometres with 10 million citizens and controlled the newly created General Government, which consisted of a further 95,742 kilometres with 12 million citizens. In total, Germany&#x27;s zone of occupation consisted of 187,644 square kilometres with 22 million citizens. The Soviet Union occupied 202,069 square kilometres with over 13 million citizens. In 1939, the invading forces consisted of 1.5 million Germans and nearly half a million Soviets.

Poland&#x27;s territory was divided between Nazi Germany and the USSR, and was governed directly by the occupying countries, without establishing any form of Polish collaborating puppet authorities. The occupying powers&#x27; actions eclipsed the sovereign Polish state, whose government went into exile, and inflicted massive damage to the country&#x27;s cultural heritage. Other war crimes against Poland included deportations aimed at ethnic cleansing, imposition of forced labor, pacifications, and genocidal acts. There were many similarities between the two zones of occupations marked by systematic oppression. Both invaders executed Polish civilians and prisoners of war in parallel campaigns of ethnic cleansing, coordinating some of these actions through Gestapo–NKVD conferences. &quot;The scale and extent of the brutality practised in occupied Poland far exceeded anything experienced in other occupied countries.&quot;

In the summer and autumn of 1941 the lands annexed in the east by the Soviets, containing large Ukrainian and Belarusian populations, were overrun by Nazi Germany in the initially successful Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union.

==Nazi German crimes against the Polish nation==

===The invasion of Poland (September 1939)===
:&quot;Main: &quot;

From 1 September 1939, the war against Poland was intended as a fulfilment of the plan described by Adolf Hitler in his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The main goal of the plan was to make all of Eastern Europe into the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space) of Greater Germany. German historian Jochen Böhler observed that the war of annihilation did not begin with the Final Solution, but immediately after the attack on Poland. In order to inspire rage against the Poles and trigger broad public acceptance for total war (that is, war with no legal or moral limitations), the Goebbels propaganda machine soon published and distributed throughout Germany two books based on falsified information: &quot;Dokumente polnischer Grausamkeit&quot; (Documents of Polish Brutality) and the &quot;Polnische Blutschuld&quot; (Polish Blood Guilt). A false flag operation, the Gleiwitz incident, was organised by the German agents to serve as the &quot;casus belli&quot;. &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (the German armed forces) was sent out without a formal declaration of war &quot;to kill without mercy and reprieve all men, women and children of the Polish race&quot;, as ordered by Adolf Hitler in his speech to military commanders on 22 August 1939. This could be seen as an attempt to destroy the entire nation. The invading Germans believed that the Poles were racially inferior to them.

====Indiscriminate executions by firing squad====
From the very beginning of war against Poland, German forces carried out massacres and executions of civilians. Many of these atrocities were not properly researched after the war due to the political divide between Eastern and Western Europe during the Cold War, wrote Böhler. Polish eyewitness accounts do not identify the German units involved; that information is traceable only through German records. Therefore, the crimes committed by the Wehrmacht (the regular German army) were often wrongly attributed to &quot;SS&quot; operational groups in Polish historiography. It is estimated that there were two hundred executions every day in September 1939. Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Reich Security Main Office, complained that the rate was too slow. Typically, the mass executions were conducted in public spaces such as the town square in order to inflict terror.

Records show that during the German advance across Poland 531 towns and villages were burned. By the end of September 1939 the names of settlements, dates and numbers of civilians executed by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; included: Starogard (2 September), 190 Poles, 40 of them Jews; Świekatowo (3 September), 26 Poles; Wieruszów (3 September), 20 Poles all Jews. On 4 September 1939 the 42nd Infantry Regiment committed the Częstochowa massacre with 1,140 citizens or more, 150 of them Jews, murdered in wild shooting actions in several city locations, leading to a final bloodbath according to Polish reports, involving frightened and inexperienced troops opening machine gun fire at a crowd of 10,000 civilians rounded up as hostages in the Main Square. The official Wehrmacht tally listed only 96 male and 3 female victims of the so-called &quot;anti-partisan&quot; action in the city.

In Imielin (4–5 September), 28 Poles were killed; in Kajetanowice (5 September), 72 civilians were massacred in revenge for two German horses killed by German friendly fire; Trzebinia (5 September), 97 Polish citizens; Piotrków (5 September), Jewish section of the city was set on fire; Będzin (8 September), two hundred civilians burned to death; Kłecko (9–10 September), three hundred citizens executed; Mszadla (10 September), 153 Poles; Gmina Besko (11 September), 21 Poles; Kowalewice (11 September), 23 Poles; Pilica (12 September); 36 Poles, 32 of them Jewish; Mielec (13 September), 55 Jews burned to death; Piątek (13 September), 50 Poles, seven of them Jews; Mień (13 September), 9 Poles; Olszewo (14 September), 13 people (half of the village) from Olszewo and 10 from nearby Pietkowo, Gabrysin and Marynki, along with 30 Polish prisoners of war; Moskwin (14 September), 9 Poles. On 14–15 September about 900 Polish Jews, mostly intelligentsia, were targeted in parallel shooting actions in Przemyśl and in Medyka; this was a foreshadowing of the Holocaust to come. Roughly at the same time, in Solec (14 September), 44 Poles killed; soon thereafter in Chojnice, 40 Polish citizens; Gmina Kłecko, 23 Poles; Bądków, 22 Poles; Dynów, two hundred Polish Jews. Public executions continued well beyond September, including in municipalities such as Wieruszów County, Gmina Besko, Gmina Gidle, Gmina Kłecko, Gmina Ryczywół, and Gmina Siennica, among others.

Along with civilians, captured Polish Army soldiers were also massacred. On the very first day of invasion (1 September 1939), Polish prisoners of war (POWs) were murdered by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; at Pilchowice, Czuchów, Gierałtowice, Bojków, Lubliniec, Kochcice, Zawiść, Ornontowice and Wyry; such atrocities would continue throughout the invasion. The German army did not consider captured servicemen to be combatants because they fought differently from them, often avoiding direct confrontation in favor of guerrilla tactics in the face of overwhelming force. Historian Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated over 1,000 POWs executed by the Wehrmacht, while Timothy Snyder, an American historian wrote that over 3,000 Polish POWs were killed in 63 separate shooting actions in which they were often forced to take their uniforms off, and estimate shared by Jochen Böhler. On top of executions by regular troops, more mass killings were conducted in remote areas by the newly formed &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; totalling 3,000 men aided by the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; volunteer executioners, bringing the total number of killing operations to 16,000 before the end of September 1939. Before the end of the year, over 45,000 Poles had been murdered in occupied territories.

====Bombing campaigns====


The invading German force was equipped with 2000 modern war planes, which were deployed on 1 September 1939 at dawn in Operation Wasserkante, thus opening the September Campaign against Poland; there was no declaration of war. The &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; first sorties of the war targeted Polish cities with no military targets of any kind; for example, the city of Wieluń was destroyed almost completely by 70 tonnes of munitions dropped within several hours in spite of the fact that it had no strategic importance to the Germans, and the city of Warsaw was bombed as well.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; took part in the mass killing by strafing refugees on the road. The number of civilians wounded or killed by aerial bombing is put at over 100,000. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; dropped thousands of bombs on urban centres inhabited only by civilian populations. Amongst the Polish cities and towns bombed at the beginning of war were Brodnica, Bydgoszcz, Chełm, Ciechanów, Kraków, Częstochowa, Grodno, Grudziądz, Gdynia, Janów, Jasło, Katowice, Kielce, Kowel, Kutno, Lublin, Lwów, Olkusz, Piotrków, Płock, Płońsk, Poznań, Puck, Radom, Radomsko, Sulejów, Warsaw, Wieluń, Wilno, and Zamość. Over 156 towns and villages were attacked by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Warsaw suffered particularly severely with a combination of aerial bombardment and artillery fire reducing large parts of its historic city centre to rubble. The Soviet Union assisted the Germans by allowing them to use a radio beacon from Minsk to guide their planes.

During the German invasion of Poland, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (special action squads of SS and police) were deployed in the rear and arrested or murdered civilians who were caught offering resistance against the Germans or who were considered to be capable of doing so, as determined by their position and social status.

===Extermination of Polish intelligentsia===
====&quot;Unternehmen Tannenberg&quot;====

Immediately after invasion, the Germans employed the earlier prepared Special Prosecution Book-Poland to launch the Operation Tannenberg campaign of mass murders and concentration camps incarcerations. German army units and paramilitary &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; (&quot;self-defense&quot;) forces composed of &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; also participated in executions of civilians. The &quot;Selbstschutz&quot;, along with &quot;SS&quot; units, took an active part in the mass murders in Piaśnica, in which between 12,000 and 16,000 Polish civilians were murdered. In the city of Bydgoszcz, the &quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot; (German Fifth Column) attempted to aid the invading German forces by shooting at the Polish Army. A number of saboteurs were executed by the Poles for treason, including for possession of military weapons. The Nazi German government in its own communiqués dubbed the Bydgoszcz incident Bloody Sunday, and claimed the wholesale slaughter of Germans in the city, which was not true. When Bydgoszcz was taken over by the Wehrmacht in October, designated killing squads began murdering civilian Poles in revenge at the Valley of Death (Bydgoszcz); 136 Polish school boys including 12-year-olds with about 6000 others by end of 1939; some 20,000 were murdered in all. Other murder sites included Gniezno, 15 Polish townsmen including Father Zabłocki; Szamotuły (20 October), five Poles in a crowded spectacle at the city centre; Otorowo (7 November), 68 Polish intelligentsia including parish priest and a count; Kościan Leszno, 250 Poles; Śrem, 118 Poles; Wolsztyn, a group of Poles; Kórnik, 16 Polish citizens; Trzemeszno, 30 Polish citizens; Mogilno, 30/39 Poles and a Polish Jew; Antoninek, 20 Polish citizens shot. Other execution sites included Rawicz, Grodzisk Wielkopolski, Nowy Tomyśl, Międzychód, Żnin, Września, Chełmno, Chojnice, Kalisz and Włocławek. More than 16,000 members of the intelligentsia were murdered in Operation Tannenberg alone.

====&quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, including &quot;Intelligenzaktion Pommern&quot; and &quot;Sonderaktion Krakau&quot;====

Tens of thousands of government officials, landowners, clergy, and members of the intelligentsia–teachers, doctors, journalists, and others (both Poles and Jews)were either murdered in mass executions or sent to prisons and concentration camps in the Intelligenzaktion (including the Intelligenzaktion Pommern). One of the best-known examples was the deportation to concentration camps in November 1939 of 180 professors from the university of Cracow in the Sonderaktion Krakau.

====&quot;AB-Aktion&quot;====

The German occupiers subsequently launched AB-Aktion in May 1940—a further plan to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia and leadership class, culminating in the Palmiry massacre (December 1940 – July 1941), in which two thousand Poles perished.

====Massacres following the German invasion of Polish territories annexed by the Soviet Union====

The direct continuation of the AB Action was a German campaign in the east started after the German invasion of the USSR. Among the most notable mass executions of Polish professors was the massacre of Lwów professors, in which approximately 45 professors of the university in Lwów were murdered together with their families and guests. Among those killed in the massacre were Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, former Polish prime minister Kazimierz Bartel, Włodzimierz Stożek, and Stanisław Ruziewicz. Thousands more perished in the Ponary massacre, the Czarny Las massacre, in the German concentration camps, and in ghettos.&lt;ref name=&quot;yadvashem/pdf&quot;&gt;AB-Aktion, Shoah Resource Center, The International School for Holocaust Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;War on the clergy&quot;====

The Roman Catholic Church was suppressed more harshly than elsewhere in &quot;Wartheland&quot;, a province created by Nazi Germany after the invasion. Churches were systematically closed and most priests were either murdered, imprisoned, or deported to the General Government. In the General Government, Hans Frank&#x27;s diary shows he planned a &quot;war on the clergy&quot;. The Germans also closed seminaries and convents and persecuted monks and nuns. Between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 2801 members of the Polish clergy were murdered (in all of Poland); of these, 1926 died in concentration camps (798 of them at Dachau). 108 of them are regarded as blessed martyrs, with Maximilian Kolbe being regarded as a saint.
===German pacification and reprisal massacres===

The large-scale pacification operations, sometimes called &quot;anti-partisan actions&quot;, constituted the core policy of the Nazi regime against Poland and resulted in the death of approximately 20,000 people in less than two years following the invasion. They were mainly conducted in the areas of General Government, Pomerelia, in the vicinity of Wielkopolska, and in the later created Bialystok District.

On 10 September 1939 the policy of collective punishment was introduced, resulting in destruction of villages and towns in the path of Polish defence lines. In Bogusze and in Lipówka in Suwałki County residents were massacred by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; as soon as the Poles retreated. Some 30 other settlements in the vicinity were burned down in the counties of Bielsk, Wysokie Mazowieckie, Suwałki and Łomża, even though there were not used by the retreating Polish forces. Around Białystok 19 villages were completely destroyed. In Pietraszki elderly people and children were fired at from an army tank, while in the villages of Wyliny-Ruś, Drogoszewo and Rutki all civilians were summarily executed, including the elderly.

Terror killings committed by uniformed troops across Poland continued and between 2 October7 November 1939, over 8,866 Poles were murdered (53 of them Jews). Among the victims were in Otorowo (20 October), five or 19 Poles shot because a swastika flag was removed by someone; Warsaw (22 November), announcement of the first anti-Jewish legislation: 53 Jews executed in public as punishment for one &quot;einheimischen Polizisten&quot; (local policeman) assaulted on the street; Wawer (27 December), 106/107 murdered;

By 1943, it was common for the public to be subject to mass murder.

===Warsaw Uprising massacres===

Polish and German historians estimate that during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising up to 200,000 civilians perished. Already in 1944 &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Heinz Reinefarth claimed 250,000 dead, which is now considered exaggerated by him for propaganda purposes. Historian Hans von Krannhals claims that at least 10 percent of the victims were killed in mass executions committed by regular German troops, including by Hermann Göring Divisions such as the 1st Infantry Division across Praga, the 2nd Motorized Division in Czerniaków, the 25th Panzergrenadier Division in Marymont as well as the 19th Panzer Division in Praga and Żoliborz districts. The most severe of them took place in the Wola district, where at the beginning of August 1944 tens of thousands of civilians (men, women, and children) were methodically rounded-up and executed by &quot;Einsatzkommandos&quot; of &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; operating within the Reinefarth&#x27;s group of forces under the command of Erich von dem Bach-Zalewski. Executions in the Wola district, referred to as the Wola massacre, also included the killings of both the patients and staff of local hospitals. The victims&#x27; bodies were collected and burned under pain of death by the members of the &quot;Verbrennungskommando&quot; made up of captured Polish men. The carnage was so bad that even the German high command were stunned.

Massacres took place in the areas of &quot;Śródmieście&quot; (City Centre), Old Town, Marymont, and Ochota districts. In Ochota, civilian killings, rapes, and looting were conducted by the members of Russian &quot;SS Sturmbrigade RONA&quot; under the command of Bronislav Kaminski and the SS Dirlewanger under the command of Oskar Dirlewanger. Until the end of September 1944, Polish resistance fighters were not considered by the Germans as combatants and were summarily executed when captured. After the fall of the Old Town, during the beginning of September, the remaining 7000 seriously wounded hospital patients were executed or burned alive often with the medical staff who cared for them. Similar atrocities took place later across Czerniaków. Captured insurgents were hanged or otherwise executed after the fall of Powiśle and Mokotów districts as well.

More than 200,000 Poles were killed in the uprising. Out of 450,000 surviving civilians, 150,000 were sent to labour camps in Germany, and 50,000 to 60,000 were shipped to death and concentration camps.

===Leveling of Warsaw following the fall of the Uprising===

The atrocities preceded the planned destruction of Warsaw by Hitler who threatened to &quot;turn it into a lake&quot;. After the rising had ended, the Germans continued to systematically destroy the city. The city was left in ruins. Neither von dem Bach-Zalewski nor Heinz Reinefarth faced a trial for their actions in the Warsaw Uprising.

===Extermination of psychiatric patients===
In July 1939, a Nazi secret program called T-4 Euthanasia Program was developed in Germany with the intention of murdering physically or mentally disabled people. The program was put into practice in the occupied territories during the invasion of Poland. Initially, it was implemented according to the following plan: a German director took control over the psychiatric hospital; under the threat of execution no patient could be released; all were counted and transported from the hospital by trucks to an unknown destination. Each truck was accompanied by soldiers from special &quot;SS&quot; detachments who returned without the patients after a few hours. The patients were said to be transferred to another hospital, but evidence showed otherwise. The first action of this type took place on 22 September 1939 in Kocborowo at a large psychiatric hospital in the Gdańsk region. A firing squad murdered six hospital employees, including a deputy director, along with their patients. By December, some 1800 patients from Kocborowo had been murdered and buried in the Forest of Szpęgawsk. In total, 7000 victims were buried there. Another extermination action took place in October 1939 at a hospital in Owińska near Poznań where 1000 patients (children and adults) were murdered, with 200 more executed a year later.

In addition to executions by firing squad, other methods of mass murder were implemented for the first time at the hospital in Owińska. Some 400 patients, along with medical staff, were transported to a military fortress in Poznań where, in Fort VII bunkers, they were gassed with carbon monoxide delivered in metal tanks. Other Owińska hospital patients were gassed in sealed trucks by exhaust fumes. The same method was performed in Kochanówek Hospital near Łódź, where 2200 persons were killed between March–August 1940. This was the first successful test of mass murder using gas van poisoning and this technique was later used and perfected on many other psychiatric patients in occupied Poland and Germany. Starting in 1941, gas vans were used on inmates of the extermination camps. The total number of psychiatric patients murdered by the Nazis in occupied Poland between 1939 and 1945 is estimated to be more than 16,000, with an additional 10,000 patients dying of malnutrition and hunger. Additionally, approximately 100 out of 243 members of the Polish Psychiatric Association met the same fate as their patients.

===Cultural genocide===

As part of the concerted effort to destroy Polish cultural heritage, the Germans closed universities, schools, museums, public libraries, and dismantled scientific laboratories. They tore down monuments to national heroes. Leading Polish academic institutions were reestablished as German. By the end of 1942 over 90 percent of the world-class art previously in Poland – as estimated by the German officials – was put into their own possession. The Polish language had been banned in &quot;Wartheland&quot;; children were forced to learn the basics of German under harsh physical punishment. To prevent the emergence of a next generation of educated Poles, German officials decreed that the schooling of Polish youth would end at the elementary level.

In his capacity as Reich Commissioner, Heinrich Himmler oversaw the kidnapping of Polish children to be Germanised. Historians estimate that between 50,000 and up to 200,000 Polish children were taken from their families during the war. They were sent to farms and families in the Reich never to return. Many of the children remained in Germany after the war unaware of their true origin.

===Ethnic cleansing, expulsions, exploitation, segregation and discrimination of Poles===


At the end of October 1939, the Germans introduced the death penalty for active disobedience to the German occupation. Plans for mass expulsions and the system of slave labour camps for up to 20 million Poles were made. Himmler thought of moving all Poles to Siberia. In May 1940 he wrote a memorandum; in it, he promised to eventually deport all Poles to the east. Most of them were intended to die during the cultivation of the swamps.

The Germans planned to change ownership of all property in the land incorporated directly into the Third Reich. In a speech to German colonists, Arthur Greiser said: &quot;In ten years there will not even be a peasant smallholding which will not be in German hands&quot;. In the &quot;Wartheland&quot;, the Nazi goal was complete Germanization. The formerly Polish territories were to become politically, culturally, socially, and economically German. The Nazis closed elementary schools where Polish was the language taught. Streets and cities were renamed (Łódź became &quot;Litzmannstadt&quot;, etc.). Tens of thousands of Polish enterprises from large industrial firms to small shops, were seized without payment to the owners. Signs posted in public places warned: &quot;Entrance forbidden for Poles, Jews, and dogs.&quot; The forced resettlement affected two million Poles. In the severe winter of 1939–40 families were made to leave behind almost everything without any recompense. As part of Operation Tannenberg alone, 750,000 Polish peasants were forced out of their homes which were levelled, and the land given to German colonists and servicemen. A further 330,000 were murdered.

====Roundups of Poles for forced/slave labour or for keeping as hostages====

All Polish males were required to perform forced labour. Between 1939 and 1945, at least one and a half million Polish citizens were detained and transported to the Reich for forced labour against their will. One estimate has one million (including POWs) from annexed lands and 1.28 million from the General Government. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes the figure was more than two and half million during the war. The Gentile population of Polish metropolitan cities was targeted for enslavement in the &quot;łapanka&quot; actions, in which the detachments of &quot;SS&quot;, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and police rounded up civilians after cordoning off streets. Between 1942 and 1944 in Warsaw, approximately 400 Poles were captured in &quot;łapankas&quot; every day. Many were teenage boys and girls. Although Germany also used forced labourers from Western Europe, Poles, along with other Eastern Europeans viewed as inferior, were subject to especially harsh discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear identifying purple Ps sewn to their clothing, subjected to a curfew, and banned from public transport. While the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish labourers as a rule were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans, and in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with Germans outside work were forbidden and sexual relations with them were considered &quot;racial defilement&quot;, punishable by death. During the war, hundreds of Polish men were executed for their relations with German women.

====Forced labour camps====
The camp system where Poles were detained, imprisoned and forced to labour, was one of fundamental structures of the Nazi regime, and with the invasion of Poland became the backbone of German war economy and the state organized terror. It is estimated that some five million Polish citizens went through them.

The incomplete list of camp locations with at least one hundred slave labourers, included in alphabetical order: Andrychy, Antoniew-Sikawa, Augustów, Będzin, Białośliwie, Bielsk Podlaski, Bliżyn, Bobrek, Bogumiłów, Boże Dary, Brusy, Burzenin, Chorzów, Dyle, Gidle, Grajewo, Herbertów, Inowrocław, Janów Lubelski, Kacprowice, Katowice, Kazimierza Wielka, Kazimierz Dolny, Klimontów, Koronowo, Kraków-Podgórze, Kraków-Płaszów, Krychów, Lipusz, łysaków, Miechowice, Mikuszowice, Mircze, Mysłowice, Ornontowice, Nowe, Nowy Sącz, Potulice, Rachanie, Słupia, Sokółka, Starachowice, Swiętochłowice, Tarnogród, Wiśnicz Nowy, Wierzchowiska, Włoszczowa, Wola Gozdowska, Żarki, and Zarudzie.

===Concentration camps===


Citizens of Poland, but especially ethnic Poles and Polish Jews, were imprisoned in nearly every camp of the extensive concentration camp system in German-occupied Poland and in the Reich. A major labour camp complex at Stutthof, east of Gdańsk/Danzig was begun as an internment camp in September 1939. An estimated 20,000 Poles died there as a result of hard labour, executions, disease and starvation. Some 100,000 Poles were deported to Majdanek concentration camp with subcamps in Budzyn, Trawniki, Poniatowa, Kraśnik, Puławy, as well as the &quot;Airstrip&quot;, and Lipowa added in 1943. Tens of thousands of prisoners died there. An estimated 20,000 Poles died at Sachsenhausen outside Poland, 20,000 at Gross-Rosen, 30,000 at Mauthausen, 17,000 at Neuengamme, 10,000 at Dachau, and 17,000 at Ravensbrück. In addition, tens of thousands of Polish people were executed or died in their thousands at other camps, including special children&#x27;s camps such as in Łódź and its subcamp at Dzierżązna, in prisons and other places of detention inside and outside Poland.

The Auschwitz I concentration camp went into operation on 14 June 1940. The first transport of 728 Polish prisoners consisted mostly of schoolchildren, students and soldiers from the overcrowded prison at Tarnów. Within a week another 313 arrived. There were 1666 major transports in August and 1705 in September. This Polish phase of Auschwitz lasted until the middle of 1942. By March 1941, 10,900 prisoners were registered at the camp, most of them Poles.

The most notorious concentration camps in occupied Poland as well as along Nazi German borders included: Gross-Rosen in Silesia, now part of Poland, Janowska, Kraków-Płaszów, Poniatowa (reassigned from forced labour camp), Skarżysko-Kamienna, Soldau, Stutthof, and Trawniki.

===Massacres and death marches during German retreat===
During the cold winter of 1944–1945 and temperatures dropping below , the Germans perpetrated death marches of prisoners of various nationalities from concentration camps, forced labour camps and prisoner-of-war camps.

In 1945, during the German retreat, the Gestapo, Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS carried out further massacres and executions of Polish civilians, such as in Chojnice (18 January 1945; 800 victims), Wieniec-Zdrój (18 January; nine victims), Płock (19 January 1945; 79 victims), Ostrzeszów (20 January 1945; 14 victims), Pleszew (21 January 1945), Marchwacz (22 January 1945; 63 victims).

==The Final Solution and the Holocaust in German-occupied Poland==

===Treatment of Polish Jews under German occupation prior to the Holocaust===


While ethnic Poles were usually subject to selective persecution in an effort to discourage them from resisting the Germans, all ethnic Jews were targeted from the outset. During the first 55 days of the occupation approximately 5,000 Polish Jews were murdered. As of 12 November 1939, all Jews over the age of 12, or 14, were forced to wear the Star of David. They were legally banned from working in key industries and in government institutions; to bake bread, or to earn more than 500 zlotys a month. Initially, the Jews were murdered at a lower rate than ethnic Poles.

====Jewish ghettos====

At the beginning of the occupation, Jews were treated differently as they were gathered together into ghettos in the cities. Himmler ordered all Jews in the annexed lands to be deported to central Poland. In winter 1939–40, about 100,000 Jews were deported. Inside occupied Poland, the Germans created hundreds of ghettos in which they forced Jews to live. These World War II ghettos were part of the German official policy of removing Jews from public life. The combination of excess numbers of inmates, unsanitary conditions and lack of food resulted in a high death rate among them. The first ghetto was established in October 1939 at Piotrków. Initially the ghettos were open but on 1 May the Łódź ghetto was closed by Germans sealing the Jews inside. The Warsaw Ghetto was closed in November 1940. The Germans started a reservation for Jews near Lublin.

The Germans tried to divide the Poles from the Jews using several laws. One law was that Poles were forbidden from buying from Jewish shops; if they did so, they were subject to execution. Maria Brodacka was the first Pole to be murdered by the Germans for helping a Jew. The Germans used the incident to murder 100 Jews being held as hostages. At the start of the war 1335 Poles were murdered for sheltering Jews.

From 1940 to 1944, it is estimated that starvation and disease caused the death of 43,000 Jews imprisoned in the Holocaust ghettos. In the Józefów Massacre, 1500 Jewish men, women, children and elderly, were killed. Most Polish Jews subsequently perished in the German death camps. Towards the end of 1942, the mass extermination of Polish Jews had started with deportations from urban centres to death camps including Jews from outside Poland.

===Warsaw Ghetto Uprising===

The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest of the Jewish ghettos located in the territory of General Government during World War II, established by Nazi Germany in Warsaw, the pre-war capital of Poland. Between 1941 and 1943, starvation, disease and mass deportations to concentration camps and extermination camps (mainly the Treblinka extermination camp) during the Gross-aktion Warschau, reduced the population of the ghetto from an estimated 445,000 to approximately 71,000. In 1943 the Warsaw Ghetto was the scene of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The ghetto was reduced to rubble.

===Extermination camps===
====Chełmno, Bełżec, Sobibor, and Treblinka====
The first German murder camp in occupied Poland was established in late 1941 at Chełmno (renamed &quot;Kulmhof&quot;) in annexed lands. The new killing method originated from the earlier practise of gassing thousands of unsuspecting hospital patients at Hadamar, Sonnenstein and other euthanasia centres in the Third Reich, known as Action T4. In Chełmno extermination camp, the &quot;SS Totenkopfverbände&quot; used mobile gas vans to murder mostly Polish Jews imprisoned at the Łódź Ghetto (&quot;Litzmannstadt&quot; in German). At least 152,000 people were gassed at Chełmno according to postwar verdict by West Germany, although up to 340,000 victims were estimated by the Polish Main Commission for Investigation of German Crimes in Poland (GKBZNwP), a predecessor of the Institute of National Remembrance.

Following the Wannsee Conference of 1942, as part of highly secretive Operation Reinhard in occupied Poland, the German government built three regular killing centres with stationary gas chambers in the General Government. It was the most deadly phase of the Final Solution, based on implementing semi-industrial means of murdering and incinerating people. The new facilities included Treblinka extermination camp (set up in July 1942), Bełżec (March 1942), and Sobibor extermination camp (ready in May 1942). Parallel killing facilities were built at Auschwitz-Birkenau along the already existing Auschwitz I in March 1942, at Majdanek later that year.

====Auschwitz-Birkenau and Majdanek====
The first Polish political prisoners began to arrive at Auschwitz I in May 1940. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned there. In September 1941, some 200 ill prisoners, most of them Poles, along with 600 Soviet POWs, were murdered in the first gassing experiments at Auschwitz. Beginning in 1942, Auschwitz&#x27;s prisoner population became much more diverse, as Jews and other &quot;undesirables&quot; from all over German-occupied Europe were deported to the camp.

About 960,000 Jews were murdered at Auschwitz amongst its 1.1 million victims, including 438,000 Jews from Hungary and 300,000 Polish Jews, 69,000 French Jews, 60,000 Dutch Jews, and 55,000 Greek Jews. The Polish scholar Franciszek Piper, the chief historian of Auschwitz, estimates that 140,000 to 150,000 Poles were brought to that camp between 1940 and 1945, and that 70,000 to 75,000 died there as victims of executions, of medical experiments, and of starvation and disease. There were also hundreds of thousands of victims murdered at concentration camps in Majdanek, Treblinka, and Warsaw.

==Ukrainian nationalist massacres in occupied Poland==


For many years during the Soviet domination over Communist Poland, the knowledge of Ukrainian massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia perpetrated against ethnic Poles and Jews, by Ukrainian nationalists and peasants was suppressed for political propaganda reasons. Among the first to suffer mass killings were the units of Polish Army fleeing the German advance in 1939. On top of uniformed men being ambushed, there are records of civilians being murdered along with them, and women raped.

Following the German attack against the USSR, many ethnic Ukrainians viewed Nazi Germany as their liberator, in the hopes of establishing an independent Ukraine. The ethnically motivated killings intensified after the Soviet occupation zone was overrun across the regions of Kresy. Some 200 Polish refugees were murdered at Nawóz. Ethnic Ukrainians were also among the supporters of the rounding up and murdering of Jews.

Numerous sources state that as soon as the Germans advanced toward Lviv, Ukrainian countrymen began to murder Jews in territories with predominantly Ukrainian populations. It is estimated that, in this wave of pogroms across 54 cities, some 24,000 Jews were killed. With many Jews already executed or fleeing, the organized groups of Ukrainian nationalists under Mykola Lebed began to target ethnic Poles, including pregnant women and children.

During the subsequent campaign of ethnic cleansing by Ukrainian nationalists gathered into paramilitary groups under the command of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (OUN-UPA) and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN-B) partisan groups, some 80,000–100,000 Polish citizens were murdered. Locations, dates and numbers of victims include (in chronological order): Koszyszcze (15 March 1942), 145 Poles plus 19 Ukrainian collaborators, seven Jews and nine Russians, massacred in the presence of the German police; Antonówska (April), nine Poles; Aleksandrówka (September), six Poles; Rozyszcze (November), four Poles; Zalesie (December), nine Poles; Jezierce (16 December), 280 Poles; Borszczówka (3 March 1943), 130 Poles including 42 children killed by Ukrainians with the Germans; Pienki, Pendyki Duze &amp; Pendyki Male, three locations (18 March), 180 Poles; Melnytsa (18 March), about 80 Poles, murdered by Ukrainian police with the Germans; Lipniki (25 March), 170 Poles; Huta Majdanska (13 April), 175 Poles; Zabara (22–23 April), 750 Poles; Huta Antonowiecka (24 April), around 600 Poles; Klepachiv (5 May), 42 Poles; Katerburg (7–8 May), 28 Poles, ten Polish Jews and two mixed Polish-Ukrainian &quot;collaborator&quot; families; Stsryki (29 May), at least 90 Poles; Hurby (2 June), about 250 Poles; Górna Kolonia (22 June), 76 Poles; Rudnia (11 July), about 100 Poles; Gucin (11 July), around 140, or 146 Poles; Kalusiv (11 July), 107 Poles; Wolczak (11 July), around 490 Poles; Orzesyn (11 July), 306 Poles; Khryniv (11 July), around 200 Poles; Zablocce (11 July), 76 Poles; Mikolajpol (11 July), more than 50 Poles; Jeziorany Szlachecki (11 July), 43 Poles; Krymno (11 July), Poles gathered for church mass murdered; Dymitrivka (22 July), 43 Poles; Ternopil (August), 43 Poles; Andrzejówka (1 August), &#x27;scores&#x27; of Poles murdered; Kisielówka (14 August), 87 Poles; Budy Ossowski (30 August), 205 Poles including 80 children; Czmykos (30 August), 240 Poles; Ternopol (September), 61 Poles; Beheta (13 September), 20 Poles; Ternopil (October), 93 Poles; Lusze (16 October), two Polish families; Ternopil (November), 127 Poles, a large number of nearby settlements destroyed; Stezarzyce (6 December), 23 Poles; Ternopil (December), 409 Poles; Ternopil (January 1944), 446 Poles.

It is estimated that anywhere between 200,000 and 500,000 civilians of all ethnic backgrounds died during the OUN-UPA ethnic cleansing operations in eastern Poland. Some Ukrainians also collaborated as Trawniki guards at the concentration and extermination camps, most notably at Treblinka.

Some Poles also murdered ethnic Ukrainians in retaliation, as in the case of Pawłokoma.

==Lithuanian collaboration and atrocities during World War II==

Lithuanian authorities had been aiding Germans in their actions against Poles since the very beginning of German occupation in 1941, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of Poles. Thousands of Poles were killed by Lithuanian collaborators working with Nazis (like the German subordinated Lithuanian Security Police or the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force under the command of general Povilas Plechavičius, many more were deported into Germany as slave labour.) Tadeusz Piotrowski notes that thousands of Poles died at the hand of Lithuanian collaborators, and tens of thousands were deported.
In autumn 1943 Armia Krajowa started operations against the Lithuanian collaborative organization, the Lithuanian Security Police, which had been aiding Germans in their operation since its very creation. Polish political and military underground cells were created all over Lithuania, Polish partisan attacks were usually not only in Vilnius Region but across the former demarcation line as well. Soon a significant proportion of AK operations became directed against Nazi Germany allied Lithuanian Police and local Lithuanian administration. During the first half of 1944 AK killed hundreds of Lithuanians serving in Nazi auxiliary units or organizations: policemen, members of village self-defence units, servants of local administration, soldiers of the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force and other Nazi collaborators. Civilians on both sides increasingly numbered among the casualties.

In response, Lithuanian police, who had murdered hundreds of Polish civilians since 1941, increased its operations against the Poles, executing many Polish civilians; this further increased the vicious circle and the previously simmering Polish–Lithuanian conflict over the Vilnius Region deteriorated into a low-level civil war under German occupation. The scale of disruption grew over time; Lithuanian historian noted, for example, that AK was able to paralyze the activities of many Lithuanian educational institutions in 1943.

In May 1944, in the battle of Murowana Oszmianka AK dealt a significant blow to the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force which has been terrorizing local Polish population. At that time, Aleksander Krzyżanowski, AK commander of Vilnius region, commanded over 9000 armed Armia Krajowa partisans.

There are also claims of smaller scale killings of ethnic Lithuanians. On June 23, 1944, in response to an earlier massacre on June 20 of 37 Polish villagers in Glitiškės (Glinciszki) by Lithuanian Security Police rogue AK troops from the unit of the 5th Vilnian Home Army Brigade (under the command of Zygmunt Szendzielarz &quot;Łupaszko&quot; who was not present at the events) committed a massacre of Lithuanian policemen and civilians, at Dubingiai (Dubinki), where 27 Lithuanians, including women and children, were murdered. These rogue units were acting against specific orders of Krzyżanowski which forbade reprisals against civilians In total, the number of victims of Polish revenge actions at the end of June 1944 in Dubingiai and neighbouring towns of Joniškis, , , and Giedraičiai, was 70–100 Lithuanians, including many civilians. The Massacre at Dubingiai was the only known massacre carried out by units of AK. Further escalation by either side was cut short by the Soviet occupation of Vilnius region two weeks later.

==Nazi German crimes against foreign nationals in occupied Poland==
Nazi Germany also committed crimes against citizens of other countries deported to occupied Poland, especially Soviet and Italian prisoners of war, who were deliberately neglected and starved, deprived of rudimentary sanitation and medical care, resulting in numerous epidemics, or executed. There were even cases of cannibalism among Soviet POWs due to starvation, as recorded in Stalag 342 in Mołodeczno. Jews and communists among Soviet POWs were mostly executed, with some deported to concentration camps, whereas at Stalag 328 they were imprisoned without any food to starve to death. The largest number of victims, at least tens of thousands each, were in camps Stalag 307, Stalag 319, Stalag 328 and Stalag I-F. Mass executions of Italian POWs were carried out in the Stalag 319 and Stalag 327 camps. There were also cases of killings of French, Belgian and Dutch POWs for escape attempts.

==Soviet war crimes against Poland==
===Soviet invasion of Poland===

Amongst the first to suffer mass repressions at the hands of the Soviets were the Border Defence Corps. Many officers were murdered by the NKVD secret police immediately after capture. Polish General Olszyna-Wilczyński was shot without due process at the moment of his identification. In the Wilno area all higher officers of the Polish Army died in captivity, the same as in Polesie, where 150 officers were already executed even before the remainder were taken prisoner. Uniformed men captured in Rohatyń were murdered along with their wives and children.

On the Ukrainian front 5264 officers (including ten generals), 4096 non-commissioned officers and 181,223 soldiers were taken into captivity. Polish regular troops in Lviv, including police forces, voluntarily laid down their arms after agreeing to the Soviet terms for surrender, which offered them the freedom to travel to neutral Romania and Hungary. The Russian leadership broke the agreement entirely. All the Polish servicemen were arrested and sent to the Soviet POW camps, including 2,000 army officers. In the subsequent wave of repressions which lasted for twenty-one months (see: Operation Barbarossa) some 500,000 Poles dubbed &quot;enemies of the people&quot; were imprisoned without crime.

===Katyn massacre of Polish military echelon by the NKVD===


Following the invasion, in April and May 1940 the NKVD secret police perpetrated the single most notorious wartime atrocity against any prisoners of war held by the Soviet Union. In the Katyn massacre nearly twenty-two thousand Polish nationals were murdered in mass executions simultaneously. They included army officers, political leaders, civil servants, government officials, intellectuals, policemen, landowners, and scores of ordinary soldiers. The Katyn Forest near Smolensk, Russia, was the primary execution site where 4,443 officers (the entire Polish military echelon in the custody of the Soviets), were murdered by the Soviet secret police. The name Katyn is now associated with the systematic execution of up to 21,768 Polish citizens in several locations ordered through a single document, including at the Kozelsk prisoner-of-war camp as well as the Starobelsk and Ostashkov camps.

Among the victims of the massacre were 14 Polish generals, including Leon Billewicz, Bronisław Bohatyrewicz, Xawery Czernicki (admiral), Stanisław Haller, Aleksander Kowalewski, Henryk Minkiewicz, Kazimierz Orlik-Łukoski, Konstanty Plisowski, Rudolf Prich (murdered in Lviv), Franciszek Sikorski, Leonard Skierski, Piotr Skuratowicz, Mieczysław Smorawiński and Alojzy Wir-Konas (promoted posthumously).

===Soviet deportations as a means of ethnic cleansing===

An estimated 1.2 to 1.7 million Polish nationals (entire families with children, women, men, and elderly) were loaded onto freight trains and deported to the eastern parts of the USSR, the Urals, and Siberia. The Soviets used against Poles the same process of subjugation used against their own citizens for many years beforehand, especially mass deportations. In 1940 and the first half of 1941, the Soviets removed Poles from their homes in four major waves. The first deportation action took place from 10 February 1940 on, with more than 220,000 victims, sent to northern European Russia; the second, on 13–15 April 1940, affected 300,000 to 330,000 Poles, sent primarily to Kazakhstan. The third wave, in June–July 1940, totalled 240,000–400,000 victims. The fourth wave took place in June 1941, deporting 200,000 Poles including a large number of children.

On top of deporting Polish citizens en masse, the Soviets forcibly drafted Polish men into the Red Army. It is estimated that 210,000 young Polish males were conscripted as newly declared Soviet subjects following the annexation of Kresy.

===Cultural and economic destruction of Kresy===
The invading Soviets set out to remove Polish cultural influences from the land under concocted premises of class struggle and dismantle the former Polish system of administration. All Polish nationals in occupied territories were declared to be citizens of the Soviet Union starting on 29 November 1939. Many Polish social activists and community leaders were eliminated through judicial murder, the unjustified use of capital punishment. Captured Poles were transported to Soviet Ukraine where most of them were executed in the dungeons of the NKVD in Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine.

Religious education was forbidden. Schools were forced to serve as tools of communist indoctrination. Monuments were destroyed (for example, in Wołczyn, the remains of King Stanisław August Poniatowski were ditched), street names changed, bookshops closed, libraries burned and publishers shut down. Collections from Tarnopol, Stanisławów and Sokal were transported to Russian archives. Taxes were raised and religious institutions were forced to close. The Soviets replaced the zloty with the rouble, but gave them blatantly absurd equal value. Businesses were mandated to stay open and sell at pre-war prices, hence allowing Soviet soldiers to buy goods with roubles. Entire hospitals, schools and factories were moved to the USSR. Soviet censorship was strictly enforced. Even the ringing of church bells was banned.

===Ethnic tensions===
The Polish territories were split between the Ukrainian and Byelorussian SSRs with Ukrainian and Belarusian declared as the official languages in local usage, respectively. Some Polish citizens of various ethnic backgrounds (i.e. Belarusians and some Jews) welcomed the Soviet invasion in the hope of gaining political concessions and actively cooperated with the Soviets. This resulted in retaliatory actions following Operation Barbarossa, including the Jedwabne pogrom (or Jedwabne massacre) of Jewish people living in and near the town of Jedwabne in Bezirk Bialystok, that took place in July 1941. The official investigation of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance confirmed that the crime was &quot;committed directly by Poles, but inspired by the Germans&quot;.

===Soviet NKVD prisoner massacres, June–July 1941===
Following the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Operation Barbarrossa, the Soviet NKVD (Secret Police) panicked and executed their prisoners en masse before retreating in what became known as the NKVD prisoner massacres. The most conservative estimate puts death toll in the prisons at up to 30,000, although there may have been as many as 100,000 victims of the Soviets as they retreated. The British intelligence officer and postwar historian George Malcher puts the total at 120,000 for those killed in NKVD prisons and during the Soviet flight. Stalin ordered the execution of those believed to have spied on the Soviet Union, which meant practically everyone for the secret police operatives.

According to the NKVD records, nearly 9,000 prisoners were murdered in the Ukrainian SSR in these massacres. Due to the confusion during the rapid Soviet retreat and incomplete records, the NKVD number is most likely an undercounting. According to estimates by contemporary historians, the number of victims in the territories previously annexed to Soviet Ukraine (eastern Galicia, western Polesia, and western Volhynia) was probably between 10,000 and 40,000. By ethnicity, Ukrainians comprised roughly 70 per cent of victims, with Poles at 20 per cent and the rest being Jews and other nationalities.

The Soviets left thousands of corpses piled up in prison yards, corridors, cells, basements, and NKVD torture chambers, as discovered by the advancing Germans in June–July 1941. The following is a partial list of prisons and other secret execution places, where mass murder took place; compiled by historian Tadeusz Piotrowski, and others.

In eight pre-war Polish voivodeships, the number of dead was between 32,000 and 34,000. The locations in alphabetical order included: Augustów prison: (with 30 bodies); Berezwecz: (with 2000, up to 3000 dead); Białystok: (with hundreds of victims); Boryslaw, (dozens); Bóbrka: (9–16); Brzeżany: (over 220); Busk: (about 40); Bystrzyca Nadwornianska, Cherven, Ciechanowiec: (around 10); Czerlany: (180 POWs); Czortków, Dobromil: (400 murdered); Drohobycz: (up to 1000); Dubno: (around 525); Grodno: (under 100); Gródek Jagiellonski: (3); Horodenka, Jaworów: (32); Kałusz, Kamionka Strumilowa: (about 20); Kołomyja, Komarno, Krzemieniec: (up to 1500); Lida, Lwów (over 12,000 murdered in 3 separate prisons); Łopatyn: (12); Łuck: (up to 4000 bodies); Mikolajów, Minsk: (over 700); Nadworna: (about 80); Oleszyce, Oszmiana: (at least 60); Otynia: (300); Pasieczna, Pińsk: (&quot;dozens to hundreds&quot;); Przemyślany: (up to 1000); Równe: (up to 500); Rudki: (200); Sambor: (at least 200, up to 720); Sarny: (around 90); Sądowa Wisznia: (about 70); Sieniatycze: (15); Skniłów: (200 POWs); Słonim, Stanisławów: (about 2800); Stryj: (at least 100); Szczerzec: (about 30); Tarasowski Las: (about 100); Tarnopol: (up to 1000); Wilejka: (over 700); Wilno: (hundreds); Włodzimierz Wołynski, Wołkowysk: (seven); Wołożyn: (about 100); Wolozynek, Zalesiany, Zaleszczyki, Zborów: (around 8); Złoczów: (up to 750); Zółkiew: (up to 60) and Zydaczów.

It was not only prisoners who were murdered by the NKVD as the Soviets retreated. Other Soviet crimes include Brzeżany, where Soviet soldiers threw hand grenades into homes, and Czortków, where four priests, three brothers and a tertiary were murdered.

===Deliberate halting of offensive against Germany during the Warsaw Uprising===

The role of Soviets is debated by historians. Questions are asked about the Soviet political motives in halting their advance on the city during the uprising, thus allowing for the destruction to continue, and denying the use of their airfields to the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces.

===The end of German rule and the return of the Soviets (January 1945)===
With the return of the Soviets, the killings and deportations started again. Stalin turned his attention to the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; (Home Army) which was seen as an obstacle in Soviet goals of controlling Poland hence the NKVD set out to destroy them. The Poles were accused of having Germans spies in their ranks, trying to take control of the Polish units fighting along with the Red Army, and causing desertions. Home Army units which fought against the Germans in support of the Soviet advance had their officers and men arrested. At Wilno and Nowogrodek, the Soviets shipped to concentration camps 1500 officers and 5000 troops.

The Home Army was made illegal. As a result, it is estimated up to 40,000 Home Army partisans were persecuted and many others deported. In the Lublin area more than 50,000 Poles were arrested between July 1944 and June 1945. It is suspected that the NKVD carried out killings in the Turza Wood where 17 bodies have been found, although witnesses put the total at 600. At Baran Wood, 13 bodies have been found but witnesses again claimed hundreds. Records show that 61 death sentences were carried out plus 37 in October 1944 alone.

====Internment of Polish nationals====
Upon the conclusion of World War II, Poland remained under Soviet military control. Approximately 60,000 soldiers of the Home Army had been arrested by the NKVD. Some 50,000 of them were deported to the gulags and prisons deep in the Soviet Union. After several months of brutal interrogation and torture, 16 leaders of the Polish Underground State were sent to jails in the USSR after a staged trial on trumped-up charges in Moscow. The Soviet Army Northern Group of Forces was stationed in the country until 1956. The persecution of the anti-Nazi resistance members was only a part of the reign of Stalinist terror in Poland. In the period of 1944–56, approximately 300,000 Polish people had been arrested, or up to two million, according to differing accounts. There were 6,000 political death sentences issued, the majority of them carried out. It is estimated that over 20,000 people died in communist prisons including those executed &quot;in the majesty of the law&quot; such as Witold Pilecki or Emil August Fieldorf.

==Estimated casualties of World War II and its aftermath==
Around six million Polish citizens died between 1939 and 1945; an estimated 4,900,000 to 5,700,000 were murdered by German forces and 150,000 to one million by Soviet forces.

In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland&#x27;s dead (including Polish Jews) at between 5.47 and 5.67 million (due to German actions) and 150,000 (due to Soviet), or around 5.62 and 5.82 million total.

During World War II, Jews in Poland suffered the worst percentage loss of life compared to all other national and ethnic groups. The vast majority were civilians. On average, 2800 Polish citizens died per day during its occupation. Poland&#x27;s professional classes suffered higher than average casualties with doctors (45%), lawyers (57%), university professors (40%), technicians (30%), clergy (18%) and many journalists.

It was not only Polish citizens who died at the hands of the occupying powers but many others. Tadeusz Piotrowski estimates that two million people belonging to fifty different nationalities from 29 countries were exterminated by the Germans in occupied Poland. This includes one million foreign Jews transported from across Europe to die in the Nazi extermination camps on Polish soil, along with 784,000 Soviet POWs and 22,000 Italian POWs.

<text>Katherine Alice Applegate (born October 9, 1956), known professionally as K. A. Applegate, is an American young adult and children&#x27;s fiction writer, best known as the author of the &quot;Animorphs&quot;, &quot;Remnants&quot;, and &quot;Everworld&quot; book series. She won the 2013 Newbery Medal for her 2012 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The One and Only Ivan&quot;. Applegate&#x27;s most popular books are science fiction, fantasy, and adventure novels. She won the Best New Children&#x27;s Book Series Award in 1997 in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. Her book &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; has won several awards. She also wrote a chapter book series in 2008–09 called &quot;Roscoe Riley Rules&quot;.

== Life and career ==

Applegate was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Since then, she has lived in Texas, Florida, California, Illinois, and North Carolina. After living in Pelago, Italy for a year, she moved back to Irvine, California. She got her start as a ghostwriter for &quot;Sweet Valley Twins&quot;. In 1997, she and her husband, Michael Grant (her co-author on many projects, including &quot;Animorphs&quot; and &quot;Everworld&quot;) had their first child, who has since come out as a transgender woman. In 2003, they adopted a daughter, Julia, from China. Following the end of &quot;Remnants&quot;, Applegate took three years off. Upon returning to writing, she wrote a picture book, &quot;Buffalo Storm&quot;, a middle reader novel, &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;, and an early chapters series, &quot;Roscoe Riley Rules&quot;, with HarperCollins. &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; won the SCBWI 2008 Golden Kite Award for Best Fiction, the Bank Street 2008 Josette Frank Award, and is a Judy Lopez Memorial Award honor book.

Applegate won the 2013 Newbery Medal for &quot;The One and Only Ivan&quot;, drawn by Patricia Castelao and published by HarperCollins. The annual award, granted by the American Library Association, recognizes the previous year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.&quot; The story, based on the real-life Ivan the gorilla, is written from Ivan&#x27;s viewpoint as he lives in a glass cage in a shopping mall. According to the award committee: &quot;Applegate gives readers a unique and unforgettable gorilla&#x27;s-eye-view of the world that challenges the way we look at animals and at ourselves.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Core&quot; (CVE-13), a named for the Core Sound in North Carolina, was originally classified AVG-13, but was reclassified ACV-13, 20 August 1942; CVE-13, 15 July 1943; CVHE-13, 12 June 1955; CVU-13, 1 July 1958; and T-AKV-41, 7 May 1959. She was launched 15 May 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding of Tacoma, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. B. B. Smith, wife of Lieutenant Commander Smith; acquired by the Navy, 1 May 1942; and commissioned 10 December 1942, Captain M. R. Greer in command.

==Service history==
Clearing Puget Sound 6 February 1943, &quot;Core&quot; qualified pilots in carrier operations off San Diego, then sailed on to the east coast, arriving at Norfolk 11 April. She continued to train pilots in Chesapeake Bay until 27 June when she sortied as the nucleus of TG 21.12, a hunter-killer group. Such groups, providing cover for the movement of convoys, made a contribution of great significance to winning the Battle of the Atlantic, and the innovation represented by their formation was a marked advance in antisubmarine warfare. Planes from &quot;Core&quot; worked in coordination with accompanying destroyers scoring a number of successful attacks. Her planes sank on 13 July 1943, at , and on 16 July at . One of her escorts, , sank on 23 July, at . &quot;Core&quot; returned to Norfolk 31 July from a most successful first patrol.

On &quot;Core&quot;″s second hunter-killer patrol, from 16 August to 2 September 1943, her planes sank on 24 August at , and the same day at . Putting to sea again 5 October in TG 21.15, &quot;Core&quot;″s planes sank on 20 October at . She returned to Norfolk 19 November.

Following another hunter-killer patrol from 6 December 1943 to 18 January 1944, &quot;Core&quot; ferried 56 P-51s and other cargo to Liverpool from 6 February to 9 March. From 3 April to 29 May, she operated with TG 21.16 in the central and North Atlantic, then sailed from New York 24 June to ferry 85 Army aircraft to Glasgow, Scotland, returning to Norfolk 20 July. Returning to antisubmarine operations 8 August as CTG 22.4, &quot;Core&quot; conducted training exercises against newly revealed enemy submarine tactics off Bermuda until 8 October when she returned to Norfolk for an overhaul. After a period qualifying carrier pilots at Quonset Point, she sailed from Norfolk 24 January 1945 to lead her group against weather reporting submarines operating in the North Atlantic, but fog and rough weather prevented successful attacks. She sailed from Norfolk 3 April to join a large antisubmarine unit at Guantanamo Bay 7 April. Operating in the central and North Atlantic as part of Operation Teardrop, the escorts of this group combined to sink on 24 April at , after the enemy submarine had torpedoed and sunk . &quot;Core&quot; returned to New York 11 May for repairs and replenishment.

Clearing Norfolk 13 June 1945, &quot;Core&quot; arrived at San Diego 25 June. She carried aircraft and aviation personnel to Pearl Harbor and to Samar, returning 30 August. Until 20 October, she sailed between Alameda and Seattle on transport duty then sailed for Yokosuka, Japan, on &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty, to return homeward-bound servicemen. She made two such voyages from 20 October 1945 to 18 January 1946. &quot;Core&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve 4 October 1946 at Port Angeles, Washington.

The ship was redesignated as a helicopter escort carrier (CVHE-13) 12 June 1955, a utility carrier (CVU-13) 1 July 1958 and finally an aviation transport (T-AKV-41) 7 May 1959. On 11 December 1961, the USNS &quot;Core&quot; docked in the Saigon Port to unload 32 H-21 Shawnee helicopters and more than 400 U.S. soldiers from the 57th Transportation Company (Light Helicopter) from Fort Lewis, and the 8th Transportation Company (Light Helicopter) from Fort Bragg.

&quot;Core&quot; was stricken for disposal on 15 September 1970 and sold for scrap in 1971.

<doc id="461592" wikidata="Q3784394" url="?curid=461592" title="Heinkel He 113">
<text>The Heinkel He 113 was a fictitious German fighter aircraft of World War II, invented as a propaganda and possibly disinformation exercise.

== Development ==
In 1940, Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels publicised the fact that a new fighter was entering service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The plan involved taking pictures of Heinkel He 100 D-1s at different air bases around Germany, each time sporting a new paint job for various fictional fighter groups. The pictures were then published in the press with the He 113 name, sometimes billed as night fighters (despite lacking even a landing light).

The aircraft also appeared in a series of &quot;action shot&quot; photographs in various magazines such as &quot;Der Adler&quot;, including claims that it had proven itself in combat in Denmark and Norway. One source claims that the aircraft were on loan to the one &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; &quot;Staffel&quot; in Norway for a time, but this might be a case of the same misinformation working many years later.
It is unclear even today exactly whom this effort was intended to impress—foreign air forces or Germany&#x27;s public—but it seems to have been a successful deception. British intelligence featured the aircraft in AIR 40/237, a report on the Luftwaffe that was completed in 1940. There the top speed was listed as 628 km/h (390 mph). It also states the wing was 15.5 m2 (167 ft²) and it noted that the aircraft was in production. Reports of 113s encountered and shot down were listed throughout the early years of the war, including citations in The London Gazette.

<doc id="461595" wikidata="Q6372239" url="?curid=461595" title="Karl Schnörrer">
<text>Karl &quot;Quax&quot; Schnörrer (22 March 1919 – 25 September 1979) was a German military aviator who served in the Luftwaffe during World War II. As a fighter ace, he claimed 46 enemy aircraft shot down in 536 combat missions, eleven of which while flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter in Defense of the Reich.

Born in Nuremberg, Schnörrer served in the Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany. Following flight training, he was posted to &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 54 (JG 54—54th Fighter Wing) in 1941, operating on the Eastern Front. He claimed his first aerial victory on 13 December 1941. In October 1942, Schnörrer became the wingman of his friend Walter Nowotny. In November 1943, he was severely wounded after he was shot down. After his convalescence, he was posted to &quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; 262, an experimental unit testing the Me 262 jet fighter. He then served with &quot;Kommando Nowotny&quot;, an operational test unit led by Nowotny, experimenting with the Me 262 under combat conditions. Following the death of his friend Nowotny on 8 November 1944, Schnörrer was posted to &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 7 &quot;Nowotny&quot; (JG 7—7th Fighter Wing), the first jet fighter wing. Flying with this unit, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 22 March 1945. On 30 March, Schnörrer was forced to bail out from his damaged aircraft, sustaining severe injuries to his leg which then had to be amputated. Schnörrer died on 25 September 1979 in Nuremberg.

==Early life and career==
Schnörrer was born on 22 March 1919 in Nuremberg, at the time in Free State of Bavaria. Prior to joining the military service, Schnörrer worked as a photo reporter. Starting in May 1940, Schnörrer was trained as a fighter pilot at the &quot;Jagdfliegerschule 5&quot; in Wien-Schwechat where he befriended Walter Nowotny. He &quot;earned&quot; his nickname &quot;Quax&quot; by crashing the difficult-to-control Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter plane three times during his flight-training. The name of a popular accident-prone cartoon character of the time, it was taken from the movie &quot;Quax the Crash Pilot&quot; released in 1941 with the famous German actor Heinz Rühmann as &quot;Quax&quot;.

==World War II==
World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces invaded Poland. Schnörrer arrived on the Eastern Front as an &quot;Unteroffizier&quot;, soon after German forces had launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. There, he was assigned initially to the &quot;Ergänzungsgruppe&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 54 (JG 54—54th Fighter Wing). The &quot;Ergänzungsgruppe&quot; was a supplementary training group attached to JG 54 under the command of &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Leo Eggers. There, he was again reunited with Nowotny. In July, he was posted to 1. &quot;Staffel&quot; (1st squadron) of JG 54. He claimed his first victory on 13 December 1941, which was not confirmed. On this mission, Schnörrer, against orders, had broken formation to attack the enemy aircraft. The &quot;Schwarm&quot;, flight of four aircraft, had been led by Horst Ademeit who later criticized Schnörrer for his behavior.

===Eastern Front===
Schnörrer claimed his first confirmed aerial victory on 12 May 1942 over a Yakovlev Yak-1. On 13 August, he shot down a Petlyakov Pe-2 bomber, his only other claim in 1942. At the time, 1. &quot;Staffel&quot; was commanded by &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Heinz Lange and subordinated to I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; (1st group) headed by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Hans Philipp. On 25 October, Nowotny was transferred from 3. &quot;Staffel&quot; to take command of 1. &quot;Staffel&quot; from Lange. Nowotny then chose his friend Schnörrer to be his wingman. In mid-December, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; began converting to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A-4 fighter aircraft. On 16 January 1943, 1. &quot;Staffel&quot; was ordered to Heiligenbeil, present-day Mamonovo, where most of the pilots received the Fw 190 aircraft.
As of 1 February, Nowotny, Schnörrer, Anton Döbele and Rudolf Rademacher, formed a team known as the &quot;chain of devils&quot; () or the &quot;Nowotny Schwarm&quot;, which during the course of the war was credited with 524 combined aerial victories, making them the most successful team in the Luftwaffe. In February, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 54 was fighting in the Siege of Leningrad. The combat area was predominantly in the east and southeast of Leningrad where Soviet forces had created a corridor to the city in Operation Iskra. On 23 February, Soviet forces launched an attack south of Leningrad as part of Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda. The attack was repelled by forces under the command of &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Carl Hilpert. That day, all available aircraft of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; flew missions in defense of this attack, predominantly attacking Soviet ground attack aircraft. By nightfall, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; reported 32 Soviet aircraft destroyed, including an Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft claimed by Schnörrer in the vicinity of Mga, southeast of Leningrad. On 15 March, Soviet forces attacked the German positions of the X. &quot;Armeekorps&quot; (10th Army Corps) south of Lake Ilmen, breaching the German lines south of Staraya Russa. Operating from an airfield at Gorodets, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; claimed 21 aerial victories that day, including Schnörrer&#x27;s fifth aerial victory. This victory was claimed over an Il-2 ground attack aircraft shot down southeast Staraya Russa.

On 1 April, the &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; (group commander), Philipp was transferred and temporarily replaced by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Gerhard Koall until &quot;Major&quot; Reinhard Seiler took command on 1 May. On 5 June, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; flew combat air patrols in the area of Volkhov as well as escorting bombers from &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 53 (KG 53—53rd Bomber Wing) attacking the locks in the harbor of Novaya Ladoga. There, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; fought against many Soviet fighter aircraft during the course of which Schnörrer claimed a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 fighter shot down. Three days later, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; escorted bombers to the railroad bridges near Volkhovstroy. On this mission, Schnörrer claimed the destruction of a Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3 fighter aircraft. On 15 June, the &quot;Nowotny Schwarm&quot; was sent on a mission to the coastal area near Kronstadt. On this mission, Schnörrer claimed another LaGG-3 fighter shot down, his eighth aerial victory in total, while Nowotny claimed his 99th to 101st aerial victory.

===Operation Citadel===
In early July, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 54 was ordered to move to Oryol, in the southern sector of Army Group Centre, where it fought in Operation Citadel which initiated the Battle of Kursk. Subordinated to &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 6 (Air Fleet 6), the &quot;Gruppe&quot; began relocating on 2 July and arrived at the airfield name Panikowo, a makeshift airfield created for the attack on the Kursk salient, on 4 July. The next day, the Wehrmacht launched Operation Citadel and I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; supported the attack of the 9th Army on the northern sector of the salient, escorting bombers of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 4, 51 and KG 53 (KG 4, KG 51—4th, 51st Bomber Wing), as well as Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers of &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 1 (StG 1—1st Dive Bomber Wing) to their target areas. That day, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; claimed 59 aerial victories, including a LaGG-3 fighter by Schnörrer in the vicinity of Maloarkhangelsk. The next day, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; targeted the airspace near Ponyri and during multiple combat missions claimed 29 aerial victories which included a LaGG-3 shot down by Schnörrer at 14:33.

On 7 July, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; again operated over Ponyri where they claimed 35 aerial victories for no loss of their own, including a Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber, also known as &quot;Boston&quot;, and a Lend-Lease Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter claimed by Schnörrer. By 14 July, Operation Citadel had failed after Soviet forces had launched Operation Kutuzov in the northern sector. Although in the southern sector, the offensive continued until 17 July in Operation Roland. That day, Schnörrer claimed an Il-2 ground attack aircraft and a LaGG-3 fighter destroyed. One of his opponents may have been a pilot from the Free French &quot;Régiment de Chasse Normandie-Niémen&quot; (Fighter Squadron 2/30 Normandie-Niemen). That day, &quot;Mayor&quot; Jean Tulasne led his unit on an Il-2 ground attack aircraft escort mission to Znamenskaya, northwest of Oryol, losing three aircraft to I. and IV. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 54. With German forces in retreat, Oryol was cleared on 5 August. Over the following days, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; operated from an airfield at Karachev, located approximately halfway between Oryol and Bryansk, predominately flying over the combat area of Oryol. On 7 August, Schnörrer shot down two Il-2 ground attack aircraft in this area.

===Battle at Kharkiv and Smolensk===
On 9 August, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; was ordered south to Poltava Airfield where they were placed under the control of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4 (Air Fleet 4). The reason for this was a response to the successful Soviet Belgorod–Kharkiv offensive operation following the Battle of Kursk. On 11 August, Nowotny was temporarily appointed commander of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot;, a position he held until 15 September when he was officially assigned as &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot;. The next day, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; flew multiple combat air patrols and fighter escort for Ju 87 dive bombers in the area west of Kharkiv. On one of these missions, Schnörrer shot down a La-5 fighter. Over the following days, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; continued to escort for dive bombers to Grayvoron and Okhtyrka. On 16 August, Schnörrer shot down another La-5 fighter. Two days later, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; returned to Kharkiv and Okhtyrka where Schnörrer claimed a MiG-3 fighter shot down in the afternoon, his 20th claim. On 20 August, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; again escorted Ju 87 dive bombers and Heinkel He 111 bombers to Okhtyrka. Without loss, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; claimed 15 aerial victories, including a Pe-2 bomber and an Il-2 ground attack aircraft by Schnörrer. The next day, Schnörrer claimed another Il-2 ground attack aircraft shot down on a mission to Kharkiv.

On 27 August, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; was withdrawn from the combat area of Kharkiv and ordered to the airfield Iwanowka which was located at Ordschonikidsegrad, present-day part of Bryansk, which again placed them under the control of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 6. The reason for this relocation was Soviet success in the Battle of Smolensk and the pressure exerted on the 9th Army. Nowotny claimed his 200th aerial victory on 8 September. On 17 September, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; moved to Vitebsk. Schnörrer claimed his next aerial victory on 28 September, a LaGG-3 fighter. That day, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; operated over Velizh, located approximately northeast of Vitebsk. On 7 October, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; again flew missions to combat area of Velizh where Schnörrer claimed a Bell P-39 Airacobra and P-40 fighter aircraft. Two days later, in combat near Nevel, he was credited with shooting down another P-39 fighter and an Il-2 ground attack aircraft.

On 14 October, to the southwest of Smolensk near Markovo, Nowotny became the first pilot to claim 250 aerial victories. That day, Schnörrer claimed his 33rd aerial victory, a P-40 shot down near Lyady. Schnörrer was awarded the German Cross in Gold () on 21 October. On 11 November, the &quot;Nowotny Schwarm&quot; lost Döbele, who was killed in a mid-air collision with an Il-2 ground attack aircraft east of Vitebsk. The next day, Nowotny claimed his last aerial victory on the Eastern Front. A few minutes later Schnörrer shot down a Yakovlev Yak-9 attacking Nowotny for his own 35th victory claim. Schnörrer was then shot down in his Fw 190 A-5 (&quot;Werknummer&quot; 410021—factory number) south of Nevel by German anti-aircraft artillery. Bailing out at approximately , his parachute failed to deploy in time, and he crashed to the ground, breaking both legs and suffering a severe concussion. Schnörrer was then rescued by the German infantry and flown in a Junkers Ju 52 to a Luftwaffe hospital in Dölau, today part of Halle.

===Flying the Messerschmitt Me 262===
Seven months later in June 1944, having recovered from his injuries, and commissioned as an officer, &quot;Leutnant&quot; Schnörrer was transferred to &quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; 262, a small unit doing flight-testing of the revolutionary new Messerschmitt Me 262 jet aircraft. In September, the fighter was ready to proceed to advanced combat-testing and his friend Nowotny was brought in to lead the project. On 26 September, the unit was re-designated &quot;Kommando&quot; Nowotny. But progress was slow and with the war-situation getting worse, an impatient General Adolf Galland arrived in early-November to get a personal report. On 8 November, in very poor weather conditions, Nowotny led a &quot;Schwarm&quot; of Me 262s into one of its first group combat missions and was killed in action, probably shot down after an engine flame-out left him defenceless. On 15 November, Schnörrer and &quot;Major&quot; Rudolf Schoenert, &quot;Oberst&quot; Gordon Gollob, &quot;Major&quot; Georg Christl, &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Heinz Strüning, &quot;Major&quot; Josef Fözö formed the guard of honor at Nowotny funeral at the &quot;Zentralfriedhof&quot; in Vienna. The eulogy was delivered by &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Otto Deßloch.
Following these events, &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 7 &quot;Nowotny&quot; (JG 7—7th Fighter Wing) &quot;Nowotny&quot; was formed and placed under the command of &quot;Oberst&quot; Johannes Steinhoff. On 19 November, remnants of &quot;Kommando&quot; Nowotny was redesignated at Lechfeld Airfield to III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 7 and ordered to Brandenburg-Briest where they joined the &quot;Stab&quot; (headquarters unit). In consequence, the 1., 2. and 3. &quot;Staffel&quot; of &quot;Kommando&quot; Nowotny became the 9., 10, and 11. &quot;Staffel&quot; of III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; which Steinhoff had placed under the command of &quot;Major&quot; Erich Hohagen. Schnörrer was assigned to III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 7 flying in Defense of the Reich. From February to March 1945, he claimed eleven aerial victories flying the Me 262 jet-fighter, making him one of the top jet-aces of the war.

On 3 February 1945, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force attacked Brabag&#x27;s synthetic fuel factory at Magdeburg. III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 7 was one of the Luftwaffe units scrambled to intercept the bombers. The USAAF lost 23 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and seven North American P-51 Mustang fighters in the attack. Schnörrer was one of the Luftwaffe pilots to have claimed a B-17 shot down that day. On 9 February, over 1,200 heavy bombers of the Eighth Air Force attacked synthetic fuel factories, railroad and other targets. Close to Berlin, III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; intercepted a formation of B-17 bombers and their fighter escort. In this encounter, Schnörrer claimed the destruction of a P-51 fighter aircraft. On 3 March 29 Me 262s from &quot;Stab&quot; and III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; intercepted USAAF heavy bombers heading for Magdeburg, Hannover, Hildesheim and Braunschweig. At approximately 10:15, Me 262s from 9. &quot;Staffel&quot; engaged in aerial combat with B-17 bombers between Braunschweig and Magdeburg. Schnörrer accounted for one of the B-17 bombers shot down that day.

On 18 March, the Eighth Air Force headed for various railway stations and tank factories in the greater Berlin area with 1,329 heavy bombers, escorted by 632 fighter aircraft. Flying from Parchim Airfield, 37 Me 262 fighters led by &quot;Major&quot; Theodor Weissenberger took off to intercept the bombers. For the first time, six of the Me 262 fighters were armed with the R4M unguided air-to-air rocket. Firing his rockets, Schnörrer shot down two B-17 bombers. On that mission, &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Günther Wegmann, the &quot;Staffelkäpitan&quot; of 9. &quot;Staffel&quot; of JG 7, was wounded in aerial combat. In consequence, Schnörrer was temporary given command of 9. &quot;Staffel&quot;, a command position referred to as &quot;Staffelführer&quot;. The following day, 1,273 heavy bombers from the USAAF 3rd Air Division again attacked the synthetic fuel factories. The bombers were intercepted by 28 Me 262 fighters north of Chemnitz. In this encounter, Schnörrer shot down a B-17 bomber.

On 22 March, Schnörrer was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross () for 43 aerial victories claimed. On 30 March, the USAAF 3rd Air Division dispatched 1,320 heavy bombers, escorted by 852 fighter aircraft, to the U-boat pens and oil storage facilities at Hamburg, Bremen, Wilhelmshaven and Farge. Defending against this attack, Me 262s from I. and III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 7 were scrambled. The attack force was intercepted north of Lüneburg. At 13:30 Schnörrer shot down two B-17 bombers, his last aerial victories. He was then hit by crossfire from a third bomber. Pursued by P-51 fighters near Uelzen, he bailed out but his leg hit the tailplane on his exit. Although he landed safely his leg wounds were so serious that he had to have his leg amputated, thus ending his combat career. Command of 9. &quot;Staffel&quot; was then passed on to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Gustav Sturm

==Later life==
After the war, Schnörrer worked as a photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa). Schnörrer died on 25 September 1979 in Nuremberg, aged 60.

==Summary of career==
===Aerial victory claims===
According to Obermaier, Schnörrer was credited with 46 aerial victories claimed in 536 combat missions. This figure includes 35 claims on the Eastern Front and 11 flying the Me 262 jet fighter over the Western Allies. Mathews and Foreman, authors of &quot;Luftwaffe Aces – Biographies and Victory Claims&quot;, researched the German Federal Archives and found records for 45 aerial victory claims, plus one further unconfirmed claim. This figure of confirmed claims includes 34 aerial victories on the Eastern Front and 11 on the Western Front flying the Me 262 jet fighter, including nine four-engined bombers.

Victory claims were logged to a map-reference (PQ = &quot;Planquadrat&quot;), for example &quot;PQ 10662&quot;. The Luftwaffe grid map () covered all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was composed of rectangles measuring 15 minutes of latitude by 30 minutes of longitude, an area of about . These sectors were then subdivided into 36 smaller units to give a location area in size.

==History==

The Polish Wrocław University of Technology was founded on 24 August 1945. A group of 27 professors, originating from the University and Technical University of Lwów, arrived in Wrocław and started the Polish academic society in the destroyed or severely damaged buildings of the Technische Hochschule Breslau. The first lecture was given by Kazimierz Idaszewski on 15 November 1945. Since then that day has been celebrated as Wrocław Science Day.

In 1951 the university was divided into two institutions. The first rector of the newly established Wrocław University of Technology was Dionizy Smoleński. From this moment, the polytechnic developed quickly and underwent numerous organisational changes.

Nowadays students of this university take part in several science programmes such as SSETI Program – developing communication systems and steering for a satellite launched 5 October 2005.

The university is one of the founders of the International University of Logistics and Transport in Wrocław, with the city of Wrocław and the French university École supérieure internationale de commerce in Metz.

<text>Dunkin&#x27; Donuts LLC, trading as Dunkin&#x27; since 2019 in some markets, is an American multinational coffee and doughnut company, as well as a quick service restaurant. It was founded by Bill Rosenberg in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1950. The chain was acquired by Baskin-Robbins&#x27; holding company Allied Lyons in 1990; its acquisition of the Mister Donut chain and the conversion of that chain to Dunkin&#x27; Donuts facilitated the brand&#x27;s growth in North America that year.

Dunkin&#x27; and Baskin-Robbins eventually became subsidiaries of Dunkin&#x27; Brands, headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, in 2004, until being purchased by Inspire Brands on December 15, 2020. The chain began rebranding as a &quot;beverage-led company&quot;, and was renamed Dunkin&#x27;, in January 2019; while stores in the U.S. began using the new name, the company intends to roll out the rebranding to all of its international stores eventually. It is also sometimes known locally in the Northeast as Dunkie&#x27;s.

With approximately 12,900 locations in 42 countries, Dunkin&#x27; is one of the largest coffee shop and doughnut shop chains in the world. In addition to various varieties of coffee and doughnuts, products sold include bagels, breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and doughnut holes branded as Munchkins.

==History==
===1948–1963: Founding years===

Bill Rosenberg opened the Open Kettle in 1948, a restaurant selling doughnuts and coffee in Quincy, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston), but in late May 1950, he changed the name to Dunkin&#x27; Donuts after discussions with company executives. He conceived the idea for the restaurant after his experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where doughnuts and coffee were the two most popular items. The company introduced its first logo in 1953, and the mascot Dunkie in 1954. The restaurant was successful, and Rosenberg sold franchises to others starting in 1955. It was during this time that Johnny Spartos, one of the men running the original Quincy location, convinced Rosenberg to produce a donut with a handle specifically for dunking into a cup of coffee.

===1963–1998: Bob Rosenberg===
In 1963 Rosenberg&#x27;s son Bob became CEO of the company at age 25, and Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened its hundredth location that year. Dunkin&#x27; Donuts was a subsidiary of Universal Food Systems at the time, a conglomerate of 10 small food-service businesses, and Dunkin&#x27; Donuts locations varied greatly in their menu options, with some selling full breakfasts and others serving only doughnuts and coffee.

In the following years, the other businesses in the Universal Food Systems portfolio were sold or closed, and the company was renamed to Dunkin&#x27; Donuts. The menu and shop format was standardized, and various new menu items were introduced. In the early 1980s counter service and ceramic coffee cups were replaced by self-service counters and paper cups. The chain went public in 1968 and was acquired by Baskin-Robbins owner Allied Lyons in 1990. By 1998, the brand had grown to 2,500 locations worldwide with $2 billion in annual sales.

Dunkin&#x27; Donuts expanded in the 1990s by buying out two rival chains: Mister Donut (which was founded by Bill Rosenberg&#x27;s former partner Harry Winokur.) and Dawn Donuts.

===1998–present: After Bob Rosenberg===

The &#x27;Dunkin&#x27; Donut&#x27; with a handle fashioned on it was discontinued in 2003 (except in Singapore) because it was hand-cut and uneconomical compared to machine-cut doughnuts.

In 2004 the company&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to Canton, Massachusetts. In December 2005 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and Baskin-Robbins (by then, operating under the name Dunkin&#x27; Brands) were sold to a private equity consortium of Bain Capital, Carlyle Group, and Thomas H. Lee Partners for $2.4 billion. By 2010, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&#x27; global sales were $6 billion.

In June 2013 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts unveiled a new store design, the brand&#x27;s first in almost seven years.

The Dunkin&#x27; Donuts location in Natick, Massachusetts launched a program to test the concept of curbside pickup in December 2016.

In January 2018, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts began to open new concept locations, beginning in Quincy, featuring modern decor, cold beverages on tap and a single-cup brewing machine, more packaged take-out options, and dedicated pick-up lines for mobile ordering inside and in the drive-thru. The concept was described as being part of a shift towards becoming an &quot;on-the-go, beverage-led brand&quot;. In addition, the location, as well as others, began to trial signage referring to the chain as simply &quot;Dunkin—removing &quot;Donuts&quot; from the name.

In February 2018, Dunkin&#x27; announced plans to phase out polystyrene foam cups globally for environmental purposes by April 2020.

In July 2018, Dave Hoffmann took over from Nigel Travis to become the CEO. He is looking to add 1,000 new locations outside of the Northeastern United States by the end of 2020 and to have a revenue increase of 3 percent for stores open a year or longer. Also late 2018, Dunkin&#x27; installed espresso machines at all possible locations and launched espresso products using a new recipe.

In June 2019, Dunkin&#x27; partnered with Grubhub to begin the rollout of its new Dunkin&#x27; Delivers service. Later in July 2019, Dunkin&#x27; partnered with Beyond Meat to introduce a meatless breakfast sandwich in Manhattan, becoming the first U.S. restaurant brand to serve Beyond Sausage. The sandwich launched nationally later in 2019.

In September 2019, the New York attorney general&#x27;s office alleged in a lawsuit that Dunkin&#x27; mishandled a series of cyberattacks that were directed at customers using the Dunkin&#x27; mobile app. These attacks took place in early 2015 and thousands of usernames and passwords stolen. The state lawsuit alleges that Dunkin&#x27; employees knew about these attacks, but failed to take appropriate action.

In October 2020, Dunkin&#x27; Brands stated that the company was in conversation with Inspire Brands, a private equity-backed company, negotiating to sell the company. Inspire Brands announced on Saturday, October 31, 2020, that they would be acquiring Dunkin&#x27; Brands Group for $11.3 billion, which would include Dunkin&#x27; Brands&#x27; debt that Inspire Brands would be taking on. Inspire would pay $106.50 in cash for each of Dunkin&#x27; Brands&#x27; shares. On December 15, 2020, the acquisition was completed, and Dunkin&#x27; Brands ceased to exist as a separate company, with Dunkin&#x27;, Baskin-Robbins, and the trademark management of Mister Donut, becoming part of Inspire Brands.

==Marketing==

Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Worth the Trip&quot; campaign starred sleepy-eyed &quot;Fred the Baker&quot; and featured the catchphrase &quot;Time to make the donuts&quot;. It won honors from the Television Bureau of Advertising as one of the five best television advertisements of the 1980s. Fred the Baker was played by actor Michael Vale for 16 years until his retirement in 1997. The catchphrase was used in the title of founder William Rosenberg&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Time to Make the Donuts: The Founder of Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Shares an American Journey&quot;.

Dunkin&#x27; Donuts changed its slogan in March 2006 to &quot;America Runs on Dunkin. They Might Be Giants songs were featured in a series of advertisements of new products to boost summer sales. In 2006, a series of Dunkin&#x27; Donuts commercials referred to the fictional language &quot;Fritalian&quot;. &quot;Is it French? Or is it Italian?&quot; sings a chorus of customers facing a long menu of non-English terms. &quot;Perhaps Fritalian?&quot; was created by Hill Holliday to &quot;poke fun at pretentious Starbucks-style coffee chains, with patrons attempting to order hard-to-pronounce lattes.&quot; The commercial was interpreted as a deliberate mocking of Starbucks. The commercials&#x27; punch line is: &quot;Delicious lattes from Dunkin&#x27; Donuts. You order them in English&quot;. It has been a point of discussion that latte, cappuccino, and espresso are loanwords from Italian which have no equivalence in English. The commercials, however, refer to the Starbucks ordering language itself, poking fun at words such as &quot;grande&quot; and &quot;venti&quot;. Further commercials in 2007 more directly mocked Starbucks, with a customer ordering a &quot;large&quot; and being chastised to use the term &quot;dieci&quot;.

Rachael Ray starred in commercials for Dunkin&#x27; Donuts beginning in 2007. In May 2008 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts removed a commercial from its website featuring Ray wearing a scarf with a black and white paisley floral design, in response to columnist Michelle Malkin&#x27;s claims that the scarf resembled the keffiyeh worn by Yasser Arafat and therefore a sign of support for terrorists. Dunkin&#x27; Donuts pulled that commercial off the air, leading to criticism of the company&#x27;s perceived kowtowing to special interests.

In March 2009, the company unveiled the alternate slogan &quot;You &#x27;Kin Do It!&quot; and launched a $100 million ad campaign promotion. In 2017, the company announced that it would begin testing the name of simply &quot;Dunkin at some retail locations, as they would like to be thought of as a destination for coffee, its most profitable product. The branding would be implemented in other locations in the latter half of 2018 if it was successful. The brand announced that it would be known simply as Dunkin&#x27; in September 2018.

In April 2018, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts teamed up with the Massachusetts shoe manufacturer, Saucony to produce a strawberry-frosted doughnut themed running shoe to commemorate the 122nd running of the Boston Marathon. The Saucony X Dunkin&#x27; Kinvara 9 came in a doughnut box and the heel of the shoe was covered in rainbow sprinkles.

The chain is a favorite among some celebrities. Ben Affleck began starring in commercials for the company along with wife Jennifer Lopez in February 2023. The first aired during Super Bowl LVII. They starred in a follow up that first aired during Super Bowl LVIII, along with Affleck&#x27;s long-time friend, Matt Damon, and former NFL star Tom Brady. The chain then announced it would add Affleck&#x27;s specific order, an iced coffee with creame, sweet cold foam, and cinnamon sugar, via its limited-time DunKings Menu.

===Logo===
A script version of the words &quot;Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&quot; was filed on March 31, 1955, and registered on February 2, 1960. A later logo was for a drawing and word logo depicting a figure with a doughnut for a head and a coffee cup and doughnut body wearing a garrison cap, with &quot;Dunkin&quot;&#x27; emblazoned on both the coffee cup and cap. The design was rendered primarily in yellow and brown. The logo was applied for on June 23, 1958, registered on May 23, 1961, and put into use on July 1, 1964.

In 1966, the company began using a hot pink color for its branding and used a logo showing a stylized coffee cup with the company&#x27;s name rendered on one line as a circle, evoking a doughnut dunking into the cup. In 1980 bright orange was added to the hot pink. As of 2014 the logo was a variation of the logo that has been in use since about 1980: an all-capitals rendering of the words &quot;Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&quot; (&quot;Dunkin&quot;&#x27; in orange; &quot;Donuts&quot; in pink) in a thick, Frankfurter typeface with a coffee cup outlined in brown with a &quot;DD&quot; monogram.

In September 2018, the company announced that it would shorten its name to Dunkin&#x27;, with a wider roll-out beginning in January 2019. The company acknowledged that &quot;Dunkin was already a common shorthand name for the chain among customers and in its marketing (including the slogan &quot;America Runs on Dunkin), and that the rebranding would reflect the chain&#x27;s continuing shift towards being a &quot;beverage-led&quot; brand at a time when consumers have shown a preference for healthier trends and options as they consume fewer doughnuts. While stores in the U.S. started using the new name in 2019, the company intends to roll out the rebranding to all of its international stores eventually.

===Primary ad agency===
In April 2018, Dunkin&#x27; named BBDO as their primary advertising agency. This replaced Hill Holliday, which had been producing print, digital, broadcast, and billboard advertising for almost twenty years. Hill Holliday was the agency responsible for the tagline &quot;America Runs on Dunkin. ARC/Leo Burnett was also named to lead all in-store promotions.

===Affiliations===
Dunkin&#x27; has a close relationship with the Boston Red Sox and the New England Patriots, making commercials at the start of each team&#x27;s season for promotions. Dunkin&#x27; also sponsors other professional sports teams, including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Philadelphia Eagles, and Tampa Bay Rays.

In 2001 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts purchased the naming rights for the former Providence Civic Center, and renamed it the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Center. The center is currently the home court for the NCAA and Big East Providence Friars men&#x27;s basketball team from Providence College as well as home ice for the AHL Providence Bruins hockey team. In reference to the center&#x27;s long association with local college basketball, it is often known locally as &quot;The Dunk&quot;.

In January 2014 English football club Liverpool announced a multimillion-pound global partnership with the company.

Dunkin&#x27; Donuts signed a sponsorship deal with the National Women&#x27;s Hockey League in December 2015. As part of the multi-year agreement, Dunkin’ Donuts is the official hot, iced and frozen coffee of the NWHL.

In 2016, Dunkin&#x27; became the official &quot;coffee, doughnut and breakfast sandwich partner&quot; of the National Hockey League.

==Locations==
===United States===

On January 16, 2013, Nigel Travis, Dunkin&#x27; Brands CEO, announced that the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts franchises would be available for the first time in California beginning in 2015 although in reality, this was a return to California, as the company had several stores operating in the state up until 2002. In July 2013, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts announced that it has signed its first Southern California multi-unit store development agreements with four franchise groups for a total commitment of 45 new restaurants. The first standalone restaurants were expected to open in 2015 in Orange and Los Angeles counties. The chain also planned to expand into more stores in Texas by 2015.

On March 10, 2014, the first Dunkin&#x27; Donuts/Baskin-Robbins combination store in Southern California opened in Ramona. This is Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&#x27; third California shop to open, following shops in Barstow and on Camp Pendleton. Since March 2014, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts has opened several additional locations throughout California, including the Los Angeles area. Dunkin&#x27; Donuts shops opened in the San Francisco Bay Area in Walnut Creek, Half Moon Bay, and American Canyon in 2016, as well as South San Francisco and Fremont, in 2017.

2014 saw the return of Dunkin&#x27; Donuts to the state of Minnesota after nearly a decade&#x27;s absence, with a new shop opened inside the Kahler Grand Hotel in Rochester.

In the United States, Dunkin&#x27; is sometimes paired with Baskin-Robbins ice cream in a single multibranded store. While such locations usually maintain separate counters for each chain (much like co-branded Wendy&#x27;s–Tim Hortons locations in Canada), depending on business that day, both chains&#x27; products can be bought at a single counter (usually Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&#x27;). The practice of single-counter service is similar to that of multibranded Yum! Brands stores such as KFC–Taco Bell, which share a single kitchen and cashier line.

As of February 9, 2017, all Dunkin&#x27; locations are franchisee owned and operated. In addition to its stand-alone shops, Dunkin&#x27; shops can be found within many gas stations, supermarkets, mall and airport food courts, and Walmart stores. In July 2013 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened its 500th restaurant in New York City. This location is combined with a Baskin-Robbins.

On July 30, 2020, Dunkin&#x27; Brands announced it would permanently close 800 shops in the US by the end of the year because of a 20 percent drop of sales in the second quarter during the COVID-19 pandemic, 450 of which are part of the previously announced closing of locations within Speedway gas stations.

As of 2019, 40 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts shops in the United States were certified fully kosher, in addition to one that sells both kosher-certified and non-kosher products.

In early 2024, Dunkin&#x27; announced it would no longer upcharge for dairy alternatives in their drinks.

===International===
By March 2014, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&#x27; largest international market was South Korea, representing nearly 40 percent of all international sales. With over 900 outlets in the country, it had three times as many as McDonald&#x27;s and about a third more than Starbucks. South Korea is home to Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&#x27; only coffee roasting plant outside the U.S. Still, the company sees China and its vastly larger population as the more lucrative opportunity. In 2008 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened its first restaurant in Shanghai, representing the first step in its China expansion strategy. By March 2014, it had about 50 stores in the country and an agreement to open 100 more over the next five years.

In Australia, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened in the 1980s but by the late 2000s, they had left the Australian market. In 2014, Dunkin&#x27; Brands global chairman Nigel Travis said there were no plans in the short term to return the brand to the Australian market. Baskin-Robbins, a subsidiary of Dunkin&#x27; Brands, continues to exist in the country.

In Brazil, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened its first building in 1980. In 2013, it planned to open 25 franchises in the country.

In Colombia, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened its first store in Bogota in 1983. By 2015, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts operated more than 100 stores only in the capital city of the country. Currently, it operates more than 150 stores around the country including locations in the cities of Medellin, Cali, Ibague, Pereira, Manizales and Barranquilla.

In January 2014, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts relaunched in England 20 years after it exited the country with its store opening in Harrow, London. There are no Dunkin&#x27; Donuts stores in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales.

On December 5, 2014, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened their first location in the Nordic region, at the Täby Centrum shopping mall in the outskirts of Stockholm, Sweden. On July 24, 2018, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts announced that the company&#x27;s Swedish operations had filed for bankruptcy and all locations in Sweden would close immediately.
On April 1, 2015, the first store in Denmark opened in Copenhagen Central Station and by May 5, 2015, one opened at Roskilde railway station. There is still one in construction in Odense.

In early December 2015, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened their first cafe in 13 years in Warsaw. The opening of a second location in Warsaw is announced for January 2016. In December 2018, a third branch was under construction in the city.

On January 21, 2016, Dunkin&#x27; Brands announced a master franchise agreement with Grand Parade Investments Ltd. that called for developing 250 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and 70 Baskin-Robbins outlets throughout South Africa. The first stores opened in the end of 2016 in the Cape Town area. Eventually, only 11 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts locations and five Baskin-Robbins locations opened in South Africa due to GPI&#x27;s financial trouble. However, by February 2019, Grand Parade Investments announced that it permanently closed all Dunkin&#x27; Brands locations in South Africa due to poor performance and unprofitably.

In September 2015, Roland Zanelli, the owner of the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts license in Switzerland, announced the opening of the first two stores in Basel, Switzerland in Fall 2015, followed by the opening of up to 60 stores in the whole country. The first Basel store opened on March 1, 2016.

====India====
On February 24, 2011, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts signed a master franchise agreement with Indian food service company Jubilant FoodWorks to operate the brand in India. Jubilant FoodWorks opened the country&#x27;s first Dunkin&#x27; Donuts outlet at Connaught Place, New Delhi in April 2012. In November 2014, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened its first store in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh inside Z Square Mall.

There were 32 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts outlets across 10 Indian cities as on December 31, 2019.

====Spain====
The term &quot;Donuts&quot; was already trademarked by one of the largest Spanish bakery firms, Panrico, so the company was born as a joint venture between Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&#x27; then-parent Allied Domecq and Panrico (only Spanish shareholders, representing 50%) in order to use the brand name &quot;Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&quot;. In 2007, after Dunkin&#x27; Donuts bought out Panrico&#x27;s 50% share, the stores were rebranded to &quot;Dunkin&#x27; Coffee&quot;. As of 2017, there are 59 Dunkin&#x27; Coffee locations in Spain, the majority of which are in Barcelona, Madrid, and Málaga. Their slogan, &quot;Juntos es mejor&quot;, translates to &quot;Together is better&quot;.

====Canada====
Despite once having hundreds of stores nationwide, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and its market share all but vanished from Canada by the turn of the century. In the late 1990s to early 2000s the chain began disappearing from all regions of Canada, with its last foothold in the province of Quebec. However, its decline was most apparent in Quebec, where the chain once had 210 stores but by mid 2017 had only three—the last franchises in the country. By then, only one free standing store had the facilities to make doughnuts fresh on site; the other two were merely shopping-mall food-court stands, dependent on the delivery of baked goods from the main store. One of the main reasons for Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&#x27; decline was competition with Tim Hortons, similar to Tim Hortons&#x27; own decline in the northeastern United States due to heavy competition from Dunkin&#x27; Donuts. A group of Dunkin&#x27; Donuts franchisees won a C$16.4 million civil court judgement against the parent company for failing to adequately promote the brand in Canada. In September 2018, after 57 years of operating in Canada, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts ceased business in that country when it refused to renew its franchise license to the few remaining stores left. All remaining Canadian locations were closed or rebranded as independent businesses in late 2018 – ending the presence of Dunkin&#x27; Donuts in the country.

Baskin-Robbins – a subsidiary of Dunkin&#x27; Brands – continues to operate stores across Canada.

====Lebanon====
Dunkin&#x27; opened its first location in Lebanon in 1998 and has since gained a lot of popularity among Lebanese people and is now one of the most popular coffee shops with many branches spread across the country.

In 2020, Dunkin&#x27; Lebanon started selling its products in supermarkets and grocery stores.

====Japan====
The first Dunkin Donuts store in Japan opened around 1969 in Ginza, Tokyo, Tokyo, becoming the first Asian country have Dunkin&#x27; Donuts. The Japanese chain was owned by a joint venture between the Saison Group, Yoshinoya, and the Japanese subsidiary of the Compass Group named Seiyo Food Systems.

As of 1982, it had 15 outlets, although The New York Times states that it had &quot;43 outlets&quot;.

After 28 years of operating in Japan, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts ceased business there in 1998 due to declining sales and poor performance. All of the non-military base locations were either closed or converted to Mister Donut locations. Dunkin&#x27; still has locations in United States military bases, which are open only to military personnel.

====South Korea====
Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Korea has launched a fun-shaped doughnut with fried chicken legs in cooperation with Kyochon, a South Korean chicken franchise.

====Philippines====

The first Philippine store of Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened in Makati in 1981 under the Philippine franchisee Golden Donuts Incorporated (GDI). Dunkin&#x27; Donuts later expanded outside Metro Manila when Queen City Food Chain, Inc. opened its first outlet in Fuente Osmeña, Cebu City in 1986. It later expanded to Mindanao when its first two branches in Cagayan de Oro opened in 1991. Its first drive-thru store was opened in Tomas Morato Avenue, Quezon City in January 2021. In mid-August 2023, Dunkin’ opened its 800th Philippine store in Laoag, becoming the largest coffee operator in the country.

====Singapore====
The first Dunkin&#x27; Donuts store in Singapore opened at Goldhill Square on April 3, 1983. The Singapore franchise for Dunkin&#x27; Donuts was initially through Spes Uuniversal Pte Ltd, consisting of Singaporean and Filipino shareholders.

====Saudi Arabia====
Dunkin&#x27; Donuts opened its first location in Saudi Arabia in 1986. As of October 2022, it operates over 500 stores and plans to operate more than 600 in the Kingdom by the end of 2022 due to the high coffee demand.

==== Israel ====
Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Israel () was an Israeli franchise of the chain. Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Israel opened their first location within Israel in 1996 in Tel Aviv. Their main flagship store was located in Rabin Square, with their factory in Lod. Upon opening their first location Dunkin&#x27; was a tremendous hit. When the original location opened it broke Dunkin&#x27;s own sales records by selling 3 million doughnuts in the first eight months. The chain&#x27;s manager was quoted saying &quot;Israelis do not stop eating doughnuts, They buy such quantities, quantities that we would never have believed they would buy. They buy boxes of 12, eat them here, and then buy more boxes to take home.&quot;

In 2001, when Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Israel decided to close, the company had accumulated a large amount of debt. When the Second Intifada broke out, Israeli tourism slowed, and Dunkin&#x27; decided to close. Approximately $2 million was invested in Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Israel when it failed. At the peak, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts had 9 branches in Israel, short of their original goal of 15, including 3 in Jerusalem.

====New Zealand====
The first New Zealand store opened in Manukau, Auckland in 2001; three others also opened in Auckland that year. By 2017, it had 12 Auckland stores and two other cities. By 2022, it had 15 Auckland stores and three other cities.

==News==
In 1997, Dunkindonuts.org was established by a customer for disgruntled consumers and employees to lodge complaints about the company. The site appeared ahead of the company&#x27;s own website in many search engines and received national media coverage before being purchased by Dunkin&#x27; Donuts in 1999.

Dunkin&#x27; Donuts was criticized by one of its franchisees for allegedly forcing single-store owners to agree to a buyout at a loss for minor infractions. Dunkin&#x27; Donuts sued franchise owners 154 times from 2006 to April 2008. Over the same period, McDonald&#x27;s was involved in five lawsuits. Subway, a company that has four times the number of locations as Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, sued its franchisees 12 times. (These figures do not include arbitrations, which the companies use in pursuing legal claims against their franchisees.) Franchisees allege that the company&#x27;s business strategy needs predominantly multi-unit franchisees.

In May 2010, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts was criticized for advertising &quot;Free Iced Coffee Day&quot; on its national Facebook page, which took place in only 13 cities. Because of the limited scope of the promotion, many customers became dissatisfied with the lack of free iced coffee and vented their anger on the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Facebook page.

In 2013, the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts chain in Thailand used an advertisement that contained a photograph of a woman in black face-paint, in order to promote its new chocolate-flavored doughnuts. The company was criticized for the advertisement, with the Human Rights Watch calling the advertisement &quot;bizarre and racist&quot;. The headquarters in the United States apologized for the advertisement.

Nancy Lewis, in Canaan, Connecticut, began a petition in January 2014 to request that Dunkin&#x27; Donuts donate their unsold food to local shelters and food banks in her area after seeing her local shop regularly throwing away &quot;large amounts&quot; of unsold food. She said because the company has no official policy on the redistribution of its unsold food items to shelters or food banks, and employees are not allowed to take any home, many affiliates throw all of the goods away.

In August 2024, a group of Trump supporters called for a boycott of Dunkin&#x27; Donuts for declining advertisements from Rumble for promoting right-wing populism. They also accused the company of being &quot;woke&quot;.

January 2025, donut manufacturer FGF Brands, LLC recalled 2 million donuts for Listeria contamination, some of which were sold by Dunkin&#x27; Donuts. All of the recalled products were released before Dec. 13, 2024 and the recall is now expired. There were no reported illnesses from the contaminated product.

<text>To a God Unknown is a novel by John Steinbeck, first published in 1933. The book was Steinbeck&#x27;s second novel (after &quot;Cup of Gold&quot;). Steinbeck found &quot;To a God Unknown&quot; extremely difficult to write; taking him roughly five years to complete, the novel proved more time-consuming than either &quot;East of Eden&quot; or &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, Steinbeck&#x27;s longest novels.

==Plot==
In this novel, Steinbeck explores the relationship of man to his land. The novel follows a man, Joseph Wayne, who moves to California in order to establish a homestead. He is joined by his three brothers once his father dies, and they create a thriving ranch. When a drought strikes the land, however, Steinbeck analyzes how men respond to having their faith shaken.

The protagonist of this story is Joseph Wayne, a rancher who was born and lived his early life on his father&#x27;s ranch. He is the third of his brothers, younger than Burton and Thomas, who are both already married, but older than Benjy. As he grows up, he feels a special connection to the land, and decides to move to California to create a homestead and start a family. His father, John Wayne, begs him not to go but finally acquiesces once he realizes Joseph&#x27;s passion, and gives him his blessing. On his way west, Joseph meets &quot;Old Juan&quot; who encourages him to establish a home and throw a fiesta once his home is set up. After a time of wandering, Joseph enters California and records his homestead in the Nuestra Senora valley. He builds his house under a great oak tree, which comes to symbolize his deceased father. While building, he works with an Indian, Juanito, who offers to be his vaquero in exchange for friendship. Joseph hears about the &quot;dry years&quot;, a lengthy drought that seems to be periodic, and is the bane of all the farmers in the area. He is convinced, however, that they will never come again. He writes to his brothers and tells them to come and join him, to take the land next to his. As they explore the land they have been given, Joseph and Juanito stumble upon a mossy rock and a deep spring in the center of a pine forest. It has an aura about it that makes everyone acknowledge that it is sacred, but it is frightening as well.

Joseph later meets Elizabeth, a schoolteacher from Monterey. After several failed attempts, Joseph wins her hand and they are married. When they return to the farm after the wedding, they discover that Benjy has been stabbed to death by Juanito, who caught him seducing his wife. When the two men meet later that night at the sacred rock, Juanito asks Joseph to kill him in revenge for his brother, but Joseph refuses. Joseph wants to pass it off as an accident so Juanito can stay on, but Juanito flees the farm, promising to return once the guilt has passed. Elizabeth is integrated into the farm and meets Rama, Thomas&#x27; wife, who helps her with many things, including her first childbirth. For a time, the farm prospers, and Elizabeth bears a child. Joseph&#x27;s brother Burton, a devout Christian, becomes increasingly concerned with Joseph&#x27;s activities with the tree, after seeing him talk to it and apparently offer sacrifice to it as well. After a time, Joseph remembers his promise to Old Juan, and the farm becomes the site of a New Year&#x27;s fiesta. After witnessing all the pagan activities that take place at the fiesta, Burton decides to leave the farm. After he leaves, the remaining brothers discover Burton had girdled the tree to kill it. In the following rainless winter, everything begins to die as a severe drought sets in, and everyone fears that the dry years have come again. 

One day, Joseph and Elizabeth visit the glade with the sacred rock, to quell Elizabeth&#x27;s fear of it. Elizabeth decides to climb on the mossy rock, but slips and falls, breaks her neck, and dies instantly. Joseph returns to the homestead in a state of shock with Elizabeth&#x27;s body. Rama sees how disturbed Joseph is and sleeps with him to fulfill their needs. Later in the novel, Joseph gives his firstborn son to her. Some time later, when the drought is forcing desperate measures, Joseph and Thomas explore the coast to see if there is any way they will be able to remain at the homestead. They meet a man who ritually sacrifices small creatures to the sunset each evening, and Joseph feels a connection to him. Upon returning, Joseph and Thomas decide to drive the cattle out to San Joaquin to find green pastures. At the last minute, Joseph elects to stay, but feels abandoned by all the land except the pine grove with the stream and the mossy rock. He believes that the mossy rock is the heart of the land, and as long as it stays alive, the land cannot be truly dead. He then lives by the rock and watches the spring slowly dry up, using the water to keep the rock wet and alive. Juanito returns and convinces Joseph to visit the town&#x27;s priest to enlist his help in breaking the drought. The priest refuses to pray for rain, saying that his concern is the salvation of human souls. Defeatedly, Joseph returns to the rock, only to find that the stream has run dry and the rock is dying. Lost in confusion, Joseph realizes that he is the heart of the land, and so sacrifices himself by cutting his wrists to water the rock with his blood. As he lies dying on the sacred rock, he feels rain begin to fall again.

==Characters==
* Joseph Wayne - The protagonist of the story, Joseph is a rancher with a strong connection to the land. He is levelheaded, but is occasionally driven to feverish actions when inflamed with the passion of the land. He marries Elizabeth and introduces her to the rancher lifestyle, and together they have a child, named John Wayne after Joseph&#x27;s father. At the end of the novel, Joseph realizes that he is the heart of the land and sacrifices himself to bring rain.
* Thomas Wayne - The second Wayne brother, Thomas has a special connection to animals. He can sense their moods and emotions, and loves to be around them. He does not understand or particularly like other men, and his only close companion is Joseph. He is the husband of Rama. He eventually takes responsibility for moving the animals to a new place after Burton leaves and Joseph decides to stay behind at the homestead.
* Burton Wayne - The oldest Wayne brother, Burton is unique in his dedication to his Christian religion. He is a sickly man, but believes that he was made so because God thought him strong enough to suffer. He sees many of the actions taken by the other brothers as pagan, and seems to be inspired by Father Angelo. He is responsible for girdling the tree at the center of the homestead. He leaves the homestead after being unable to deal with the irreligious actions of those surrounding him. He is the husband of Harriet.
* Benjy Wayne - The youngest Wayne brother. He is a charge upon his brothers, being irresponsible and irreverent, but appearing to be helpless and innocent. He often drinks himself into a stupor and sings drunken songs, to the shame of the others. Although married to Jennie, he often ends up sleeping with other women, which eventually leads to his death. He is killed by Juanito when he is caught in the act of seducing Alice, which inspires Juanito&#x27;s self-imposed exile.
* Juanito - A Mexican, Juanito is part of the lumber carriers who help Joseph build his house. Although he claims to be Castilian, he later confesses that he is not. He is a close friend of Willie and is one of the few who can calm him when he has night terrors. Juanito becomes Joseph&#x27;s &quot;vaquero&quot;, asking only friendship in return. He also knows more about the sacred rock and spring than anyone else, and tells Joseph about it when they stumble onto it. He marries Alice during the novel, and stabs Benjy to death.
* Willie - The son of Ramos, the lumber carrier, Willie is mentioned mostly in relation to his nightmares. He often dreams of finding himself in a deserted, blank landscape with holes, out of which come creatures who pull off his arms and legs. When Willie and Juanito look through a telescope at the Moon, Willie hangs himself, because in the Moon he sees the place of his nightmares. His death seems to foreshadow the macabre effect of solitude in nature found in the book.
* Elizabeth McGregor - Joseph&#x27;s wife. She was raised under a strict father, and went to school to become a teacher. While working as a teacher at Monterey, she meets Joseph and eventually agrees to come home with him as his wife. She is a clever, book-smart woman, but doesnot have much worldly experience and relies heavily on Rama to explain things she does not understand.
* Rama - Rama is the wife of Thomas. She is a strong, worldly woman with much experience, and an expert at anything relating to maternity. As a result, she is contemptuous of nearly everything that men think or do. She is strict, but consistent, and a favorite among children. She understands people better than the other characters, and picks up on the smallest clues. She has three daughters with Thomas, and later inherits Joseph&#x27;s firstborn.
* John Wayne (father of all the brothers) - John Wayne is a character only briefly in the novel, but he remains a powerful presence throughout it. He gives Joseph permission to go west and his blessing, but dies soon afterward. Joseph sees his spirit as being within the tree at the center of the homestead, and is therefore crushed when Burton kills it, for it was as if he had lost his father again. John is described as gentle, with a simplistic view of justice and is very down-to-earth.
* John Wayne (son of Joseph Wayne) - John Wayne is the son of Joseph and Elizabeth. His namesake is Joseph&#x27;s father. He was barely an infant when his mother died, and is still very young at the end of the novel. He is given by Joseph to Rama, and it appears that he never had a deep attachment to John.
* Father Angelo - The priest assigned to the Indian village nearby. He is stringently Christian, and is fighting against the pagan traditions all around him. When Joseph visits him at the end of the novel, he seems to be collected and omniscient. He knows about the tree and Joseph&#x27;s connection to it, and asks him to come to the Church instead of worshiping something pagan. However, when Father Angelo refuses to pray for rain, insisting instead that his business is with saving souls, Joseph cannot stand his passive attitude and leaves.

==Major themes==
The novel examines what is meant by belief and how it affects different people. It also portrays the connection between the farmer and the land, a common theme, which appeared also in his later novels, such as &quot;East of Eden&quot;.

<text>Eugène Freyssinet () (13 July 1879 – 8 June 1962) was a French structural and civil engineer. He was the major pioneer of prestressed concrete.

==Biography==
Freyssinet was born in at Objat, Corrèze, France. He worked in the &quot;École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées&quot; in Paris, France where he designed several bridges until the First World War intervened. His tutors included Charles Rabut. He served in the French Army from 1904 to 1907 and again from 1914 to 1918 as a road engineer.

His most significant early bridge was the three span Pont le Veurdre near Vichy, built in 1911. At the time, the 72.5 metre (238 ft) spans were the longest so far constructed in France although Grafton Bridge a 97.6 metre reinforced concrete bridge had been opened in April 1910 and the Rocky River Bridge in Cleveland Ohio, an 85.34 metre unreinforced bridge had been opened in October 1910.

Freyssinet&#x27;s proposal was for three reinforced concrete truss spans, and was significantly less expensive than the standard masonry arch design. The design used jacks to raise and connect the arches, effectively introducing an element of prestress. The bridge also enabled Freyssinet to discover the phenomenon of creep in concrete, whereby the concrete deforms with time when placed under stress. Regarding this bridge, Freyssinet wrote: &quot;I have always loved it more than any other of my bridges, and of all that the War has destroyed, it is the only one whose ruin has caused me real grief&quot;.

He served as the director of Public Works in Moulins starting in 1905. He also served as a road engineer in central France from 1907 until 1914.

Eugène achieved a significant breakthrough in thin-shell structures with the design of two huge and celebrated airship hangars at Villeneuve-Orly Airport in 1923. The principle of the corrugated form for the concrete shell was introduced there to obtain necessary stiffness for a 70m span. In 1924 he applied the same principle of
corrugated shell roofing for two airplanes hangars spanning 55m at Vélizy – Villacoublay.

Working for Claude Limousin until 1929, he designed a number of structures including a 96.2 m (315 ft) arch bridge at Villeneuve-sur-Lot, and several large thin-shell concrete roofs, including aircraft hangars at Istres, Bouches-du-Rhone in 1917 and 300-foot-wide, 200-foot-high twin &quot;dirigible&quot; sheds at Orly from 1916 to 1923. During the First World War he also built cargo ships using reinforced concrete at Rouen. Freyssinet&#x27;s major contribution to the science of concrete construction was the use of forced steam around the concrete moulds which significantly shortened the curing time of the concrete.

His 1919 design at St Pierre du Vauvray again increased the record for a concrete arch span, with 132 m (435 ft) hollow arches, completed in 1923. Also in 1919 his &quot;Pont De La Liberation&quot; in Villeneuve-sur-Lot was completed which was the largest single span in the world at 96.25 metres.

His largest structure was the Plougastel Bridge with three identical spans of 180 m (592 ft) each, completed in 1930. Here he studied creep in more detail, and developed his ideas of prestressing, taking out a patent in 1928.

Although Freyssinet did much to develop prestressed concrete, he was not its inventor. Other engineers such as Doehring had patented methods for prestressing as early as 1888, and Freyssinet&#x27;s mentor Rabut built prestressed concrete corbels. Freyssinet&#x27;s key contribution was to recognise that only high-strength prestressing wire could counteract the effects of creep and relaxation, and to develop anchorages and other technology which made the system flexible enough to be applied to many different types of structures.

Having left Limousin, he set up his own firm to build prestressed concrete electricity pylons, but the business failed.

In 1935, he used prestressing to consolidate the maritime station of Le Havre which was threatening to settle beyond repair. Freyssinet introduced prestressed concrete beams, and jacked up the shipyard buildings. Following this success, he joined the firm of Campenon-Bernard and went on to design several prestressed bridges.

Many of Freyssinet&#x27;s designs were new and elaborate for his time—some of them so much so that they were never built, such as the &quot;Phare du Monde&quot;, a 2,300 foot tower planned for the 1937 World Fair in Paris. According to Leonardo Troyano, &quot;his capacity for creation, invention and research and his non-conformity with existing ideas and doctrines made him one of the most notable engineers in the history of engineering&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Fencer&quot; (D64/R308) was an American-built that served with the Royal Navy during the Second World War.

Acquired by the United States Navy for conversion to a ; she was transferred to the Royal Navy and commissioned as &quot;Fencer&quot; on 1 March 1943, under the Lend-Lease agreement. She spent most of her career escorting convoys in the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean, she transferred to the British East Indies Fleet in October 1944.

==Construction==
&quot;Fencer&quot; was laid down 5 September 1941, as a C3-S-A1 freighter, under Maritime Commission contract, MC hull #197, by Western Pipe and Steel Company, in San Francisco, California. The hull was purchased by the US Navy to be converted to a and named &quot;Croatan&quot; (AVG-14). While under construction she was transferred to the Admiralty under the Lend-Lease agreement, with a Royal Navy commissioning crew arriving in May 1942, under the command of Commander C.N. Lentaigne, RN. She was launched on 4 April 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Powers Symington. She was redesignated as ACV-14, on 20 Aug 1942. She was commissioned into the US Navy on 20 February 1943, as &quot;Croatan&quot;, and decommissioned and transferred to the RN, on 27 February 1943. She was commissioned into the RN, on 1 March 1943, as HMS &quot;Fencer&quot; (D64), with Captain E.W. Anstice, RN in command.

==Design and description==
&quot;Fencer&quot; was the fourth ship in what became the Royal Navy&#x27;s of 11 ships; one of 38 escort carriers built in the United States for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. The Western Pipe &amp; Steel shipyards built three other ships in the class. Once completed she was supplied under the terms of Lend-Lease agreement to the Royal Navy. There was a ships complement of 646 men, who lived in crew accommodation that was significantly different from the arrangements that were normal for the Royal Navy at the time. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three-tier bunk-beds, 18 to a cabin, which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.

&quot;Fencer&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at full load. Power was provided by two boilers feeding steam to a turbine driving one shaft, giving , which could propel the ship at .

She had the capacity for up to 24 aircraft which could be a mixture of anti-submarine and fighter aircraft; the British Hawker Sea Hurricane and Supermarine Seafire naval fighters, Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber or the American-supplied Grumman Martlet and Vought F4U Corsair fighters or Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber could be carried. The exact composition of the embarked squadrons depended upon the mission. Some squadrons were composite squadrons for convoy defence and would be equipped with both anti-submarine and fighter aircraft, while other squadrons working in a strike carrier role would only be equipped with fighter aircraft. Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the flight deck, two aircraft lifts , and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck.
The ships armament concentrated on anti-aircraft (AA) defence and comprised two QF MK V dual purpose guns in single mounts, eight Bofors guns in twin mounts and ten Oerlikon cannons in single and eight in twin mounts.

&quot;Fencer&quot; was designed to accompany other ships forming the escort for convoys. The anti-submarine aircraft employed were initially the Fairey Swordfish and later the Grumman Avenger, which could be armed with torpedoes, depth charges, bombs or RP-3 rocket projectiles. As well as carrying out their own attacks on U-Boats, these aircraft identified their locations for the convoy&#x27;s escorts to mount an attack. Typically anti-submarine patrols would be flown between dawn and dusk. One aircraft would fly about ahead of the convoy, while another patrolled astern. Patrols would last between two and three hours, using both radar and visual observation in their search for U-Boats.
&quot;Fencer&quot; also had a secondary role, providing oil and provisions for her accompanying destroyers. This could be a lengthy process and was done on the move. It took 40 minutes from firing a line across to the destroyer to start pumping oil, while it took another two hours to pump 98 tons of oil and a further 35 minutes to disconnect the hose pipe and secure the equipment.

==Service history==
As an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carrier, &quot;Fencer&quot; escorted convoys in the North Atlantic and to
Russia.

On 10 February 1944, while escorting Convoy ON-223 in the North Atlantic west of Ireland, one of her Fairey Swordfish from 842 squadron, sank , with depth charges, 51 dead (all hands lost).

On 3 April 1944, along with her sister ships and and the , she participated in the Operation Tungsten, the strike on the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The escort carriers provided ASW cover for the battleships and and fleet carriers and .
When Operation Tungsten completed &quot;Fencer&quot; set sail for the Kola Inlet. On 28 April 1944, &quot;Fencer&quot; left Kola Inlet, as an escort for the 45 ship convoy RA 59, for Loch Ewe, in Scotland. On 30 April, was sunk by at , she would be the only allied ship lost in the convoy. For the next three days, Swordfish from 842 squadron, flying from &quot;Fencer&quot;, would sink one U-boat a day. On 1 May, was sunk at by depth charges, on 2 May, was sunk at by rockets, and on 3 May, was sunk at by depth charges. The convoy arrived at Loch Ewe, on 6 May.

&quot;Fencer&quot; was assigned to the East Indies Fleet in late October 1944. She departed Greenock, with her sister ship , for Ceylon, present day Sri Lanka, with the DeHavilland Mosquito fighter bombers of 618 squadron on their decks. After stops at Gibraltar, Port Said, and transit through the Suez Canal, she arrived at Trincomalee Harbour. On 23 December 1944, the escort carriers arrived in Melbourne.

She was converted to trooping duties at the Selborne dry dock at Simon&#x27;s Town, South Africa, from 9–11 July 1944. &quot;Fencer&quot; was then tasked with ferrying civilian and military personnel to Mombassa, then Ceylon, and then the UK.

==Decommissioning==
Following World War II, she returned to the USN, 11 December 1946, stricken for disposal on 28 January 1947, and sold into merchant service 30 December 1947.

==Civilian service==
&quot;Fencer&quot;, along with the &quot;Ruler&quot;-class , were sold to the Italian businessman Achille Lauro, for conversion to passenger ships for the Italy-Australia service. &quot;Fencer&quot; was moved to Jacksonville, Florida, for stripping before being sent to SA Navalmeccanica Cantieri, where she was converted and renamed &quot;Sidney&quot;. She had accommodations for 92 first class passengers and 666 tourist class passengers, with an increase to .

During the winter of 1958–1959, &quot;Sidney&quot; was modernized at Genoa, which increased her first class capacity to 119 and her tourist class capacity to 994. She was renamed &quot;Roma&quot; in 1968, after &quot;Roma&quot;, ex-&quot;Atheling&quot;, was scrapped. She was laid up in La Spezia, in October 1970, and sold in December 1970, to joint owners Cosmos Tours and Sovereign Cruises, Cyprus, and renamed &quot;Galaxy Queen&quot;. Her registry was moved to Greece, in 1973, and renamed &quot;Lady Tina&quot;, before being sold and renamed &quot;Caribia 2&quot;. In September 1974, &quot;Caribia 2&quot; arrived at La Spezia, to await scrapping. She was sold in September 1975, for breaking.

<doc id="461617" wikidata="Q8023756" url="?curid=461617" title="Winchell's Donuts">
<text>Winchell&#x27;s Donut House is an international doughnut company and coffeehouse chain founded by Verne Winchell on October 8, 1948, in Temple City, California. Currently, there are over 170 stores in 6 western states, as well as Guam, Saipan, and Saudi Arabia. Several stores also operated in Nagoya, Japan in the past, with most stores located inside Uny supermarkets, as Uny Co., Ltd. was the master franchise holder in Japan. It is headquartered in the City of Industry, California.

==History==

The chain&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Home of the Warm &#x27;n Fresh Donut,&quot; and it claims to be the West Coast&#x27;s largest doughnut chain. It also offers its customers a 14-doughnut dozen, as opposed to the standard baker&#x27;s dozen of 13.

In 2004, Winchell&#x27;s was purchased by Yum-Yum Donuts, a company which operates 70 donut shops under its own name, but continues to operate Winchell&#x27;s shops under their name.

From 2002 to 2008, Winchell&#x27;s closed its shops in Portland, Oregon and they were replaced by &quot;Heavenly Donuts&quot;.
In 2005, it withdrew from the Kansas City area, and most locations became Krispy Kreme.

<doc id="461618" wikidata="Q7950523" url="?curid=461618" title="WHYY-TV">
<text>WHYY-TV (channel 12) is a television station licensed to Wilmington, Delaware, United States, serving as the primary PBS member station for the Philadelphia area. It is owned by WHYY, Inc., alongside NPR member WHYY-FM (90.9). WHYY-TV and WHYY-FM share studios and offices on Independence Mall in Center City, Philadelphia, with an additional office in Wilmington; through a channel sharing agreement with WMCN-TV (channel 44), the two stations transmit using WHYY-TV&#x27;s spectrum from an antenna in Philadelphia&#x27;s Roxborough section.

WHYY-TV is one of four PBS member stations serving the Philadelphia market, alongside Philadelphia-licensed WPPT (channel 35), Allentown-based WLVT-TV (channel 39), and NJ PBS (WNJS, channel 23, and WNJT, channel 52). In southern Delaware and on the Delmarva Peninsula, WHYY-TV is seen on WDPB (channel 64), a full-time rebroadcaster in Seaford, Delaware.

WHYY-TV was established in 1957 on channel 35 in Philadelphia as the first educational TV station in the city. Seeking to expand its coverage area, it successfully filed to use channel 12 in Wilmington, which was left vacant after the closing of a commercial station, and moved its primary programming there in 1963. It also opened a Wilmington studio and began producing Delaware-oriented public affairs programming.

==History==
===The channel 35 years===
In May 1951, Philadelphia&#x27;s Board of Education first considered the idea of asking for an educational television channel, either Philadelphia&#x27;s 35 in the newly created UHF band or the channel 12 allocation at Wilmington, for use by the city schools and other organizations. A $150,000 grant from the Ford Foundation was received in 1953, when the Delaware Valley Educational Television Corporation was chartered and filed for channel 35. A year later, the Philadelphia Educational Radio Corporation, a consortium of schools and colleges, launched WHYY (90.9 FM), the city&#x27;s first noncommercial radio service, on December 15, 1954.

With WHYY radio in operation, the focus shifted to giving birth to WHYY television. After the organization changed its name to the Metropolitan Philadelphia Educational Radio and Television Corporation, it received a construction permit in March 1956 for a station on UHF channel 35, the designated educational television channel for the city. That April, WHYY negotiated a five-year lease of the former WCAU-TV studios at 1622 Chestnut Street. Plans called for a weekly output of 25 hours of programming. The station appeared ready to go on November 26, 1956. Twelve city schools were being equipped with UHF-capable sets to receive the programs; a two-page feature entitled &quot;This Is WHYY&quot; ran in a late October edition of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; Magazine; and test patterns were being broadcast. However, an unexpected snag emerged between station management and the school board. It had committed $100,000 to finance the station but instead opted to give only $75,000, diverting the remainder to a management study of the new outlet by a New York firm. The school board wanted control to be based on financial contributions, which would have given it more power in station decision-making, and there were also concerns that the UHF station would suffer from the inability of all television sets to tune that band (as television sets were not required to include UHF tuning until the All-Channel Receiver Act took effect in 1964).

The school board&#x27;s decision set WHYY-TV back nearly a year; after an agreement was reached to reorganize the board of directors and for the chairman and president of WHYY to present their resignations, the last obstacle was removed in February, with the station finally debuting on September 16, 1957. Six months after start-up, the first nighttime programs were presented by the station to complement daytime instructional output.

===The fight for channel 12===
WHYY-TV had been on the air in Philadelphia for a year when events further down the Delaware River transpired that would have a major effect on the young station. Channel 12 in Wilmington had been occupied by WVUE, a commercial station. WVUE closed in September 1958, a casualty of ownership complications and financial losses, and within a week of its shutdown, committees involving Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey legislators were formed to study the feasibility of procuring channel 12 for regional educational broadcasting use while maintaining channel 35.

WHYY was not the only entity interested in channel 12. Other applicants also filed for authority to build it as a commercial station. As Delaware groups marshaled a demonstration in Washington in support of designating the VHF channel for educational use, the FCC convened hearings with WHYY and four commercial applicants to start in October 1960, then delayed into 1961.

The four commercial applicants each had configurations of television experience and political backing. Metropolitan Broadcasting (renamed Metromedia in April 1961), owner of independent television stations in Washington (WTTG) and New York City (WNEW-TV) as well as Philadelphia&#x27;s WIP radio, had taken an option on a $185,000 parcel of land in Wilmington for potential facilities. National Telefilm Associates, another owner of a New York City-area station (WNTA-TV); locally based Rollins Broadcasting, owned by former lieutenant governor John W. Rollins and his brother O. Wayne Rollins and owner of Wilmington radio station WAMS (1380 AM); and Wilmington Television, a private firm owned by primarily Midwest backers led by Egmont Sonderling, were also in the running. National Telefilm and Wilmington Television bowed out in February 1961, leaving Metropolitan, Rollins, and WHYY. Just as oral hearings finally commenced in October, Metromedia unexpectedly withdrew despite having prepared voluminous exhibits and materials in support of its case; no reason was given.

With the fight having been winnowed to two, oral hearing centered around program proposals and Rollins&#x27;s record as a broadcaster with WAMS, which WHYY charged to be poor. Rollins attacked WHYY for leading a letter-writing campaign to the FCC that constituted illegal &quot;ex parte&quot; communications to the commission. WHYY contended Wilmington had enough commercial service from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Salisbury, Maryland, stations; Rollins believed Delaware could support a commercial station with a strong public service component, claiming WHYY was dominated by Philadelphia interests.

It took months for FCC hearing examiner Walther Guenther to render an initial decision, which Delaware&#x27;s U.S. representative, Harris McDowell, criticized as a product of a slow comparative hearing process. The decision, handed down in late September, awarded the channel to WHYY. Guenther found that, although WAMS operated in the public interest, there was a &quot;distinctly greater need&quot; for a VHF educational TV channel than for another commercial service; he favored WHYY on diversity of media ownership over Rollins&#x27;s nine radio and three television stations but Rollins on its ability to air paid political programming and its familiarity with the area. Instead of appealing, Rollins withdrew on November 13, 1962, paving the way for WHYY to win a channel 12 construction permit on December 26.

===Expanding to Wilmington and growth in Philadelphia===
After Rollins dropped out, WHYY began planning for the needed physical plant to activate the channel. It announced it would be a two-city operation with studios in Wilmington and Philadelphia, having already obtained an option on land for a transmitter site at Glassboro, New Jersey, from where WVUE had broadcast. The move in total would cost $1.1 million. Wilmington studios were built in the former Frederick Douglass Elementary School at Fifth and Scott streets, which closed in the 1950s when Wilmington desegregated.

The WHYY-TV call letters moved to the channel 12 construction permit in March 1963. That necessitated the UHF station—which would be retained to provide secondary and specialized service—to adopt a new call sign, WUHY-TV, and because the FCC did not permit at that time that broadcast stations with different cities of license could share a base call sign, the Philadelphia radio station also changed to WUHY.

After five years of silence, channel 12 from Wilmington came alive with WHYY-TV on September 12, 1963, expanding its reach to viewers without UHF converters in the Delaware Valley. The in-school programming that had been used for years in Philadelphia schools made its way into 23 school districts in Delaware. In January 1964, the WHYY Philadelphia studios relocated to the former WFIL radio and television facilities at 46th and Market streets after Triangle Publications, the owner of WFIL radio and television, gifted the building and equipment to WHYY as the commercial stations moved to a site on City Line Avenue. National Educational Television, the original public television network to which WHYY had belonged since the late 1950s, was replaced with PBS in October 1970.

In 1971, WHYY-TV relocated its transmitter from Glassboro to the Roxborough tower farm where other Philadelphia stations are located. WUHY-TV remained in service providing alternate programming—including the only on-air preview of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; before its national debut, a week-long run starting on July 21, 1969—until August 1976, when WHYY surrendered its license. Despite this, the station had a low profile on the network relative to the market it served. Its ties to cultural institutions in the city were weak, and its contributions to the network were poor. In a 1976 feature article in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; magazine that declared WHYY-TV &quot;an experiment in mediocrity&quot;, one PBS executive, H. David Lacey, noted that &quot;WHYY&#x27;s credibility is about as high as a gnat&#x27;s behind&quot;. The station was slow to attract underwriters; took a passive role in broadcasting local cultural programming, often at the suggestion of other groups; and lacked recognized output.

The city of Philadelphia turned over the $13 million Living History Center, a museum opened for the bicentennial in 1976, to WHYY in 1978, and the stations&#x27; operations moved there in phases from 1979 to 1981: administration in February 1979, radio in August 1980 (using the center&#x27;s former cafeteria), and television production and transmission in late 1981. The facility is still used by WHYY radio and television today; it was renovated in 1999, with a new glass façade and open-plan studio.

===Public TV goes south===
Residents of southern Delaware, however, did not receive full service from the Wilmington station. In 1980, the Delaware Citizens&#x27; Committee announced it would build a translator for WHYY-TV in Seaford, to make it available in that area. The group had been formed to bring a commercial station to southern Delaware; in 1978, Seaford&#x27;s channel 38 assignment was changed to commercial and a noncommercial reserved channel 64 added. At that time, the only PBS cable service for households in that area was WCPB, the Maryland Public Television transmitter at Salisbury. A final contract was issued in November 1980 to build the 1,000-watt rebroadcaster atop a tower in Sharpstown, Maryland.

To augment the service and ensure cable companies picked it up instead of bypassing the translator for WHYY-TV&#x27;s feed, the Citizens&#x27; Committee applied in January 1981 for a full-service license, activating it that December 4 as WDPB. WDPB operated independently of WHYY-TV, paying for its own PBS national programs and producing a limited number of local shows focusing on southern Delaware. Plans were revealed in 1982 to relocate the translator setup to Dover and replace it in Seaford with a 5,000-watt facility. However, tiny WDPB had a precarious independent existence. In December 1982, the home on Seaford&#x27;s Front Street that it was leasing as a studio facility was put on the auction block; the station was unaware until a receptionist spotted a classified advertisement. WDPB moved to another former home on the edge of town, and in 1984, it boosted its effective radiated power to 75,000 watts.

In November 1985, a decision by the Bicentennial Community Improvement Committee, created to support projects around Delaware&#x27;s 200th anniversary of statehood in 1987, not to award a grant to WDPB to buy equipment left the station unable to obtain Corporation for Public Broadcasting matching funds and meet its own financial commitments, putting channel 64 close to going off the air. Two months earlier, WDPB&#x27;s only local programs had gone off the air for lack of money; its most successful fund drive in station history had only raised $5,000. WHYY stepped in to save the station and run it on an interim basis while it worked through acquiring it outright. FCC approval for the purchase was obtained in March 1986, at which time WDPB viewers began seeing all of WHYY-TV&#x27;s programming.

===The 1990s and beyond===

In 1997, Rick Breitenfeld, who had led WHYY for 14 years and oversaw a doubling of its TV viewership, retired. Former Philadelphia city water commissioner William J. Marrazzo was named president of WHYY, envisioning an organization that would take advantage of digital multicasting and produce top-quality programs. Renovated studios, dubbed the Technology Center, opened in 1999.

While the station began to turn surpluses and tripled its number of major donors, Marrazzo&#x27;s high compensation raised questions from staff and charity groups. His fiscal year 2007 compensation of $740,090 exceeded that of his counterparts at WNET and WGBH, which had multiple times the revenue of WHYY, as well as the chief executives of PBS and NPR itself. Charity Navigator put Marrazzo on its list of &quot;10 Highly Paid CEOs at Low-Rated Charities&quot;. Employees wrote a letter to Marrazzo advising of the &quot;growing negative climate&quot; and &quot;low morale&quot; he had fostered and calling for his resignation. An article in &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine declared that &quot;unlike top-flight PBS stations, it produces no regular national TV programming and hardly any local programming of note&quot;.

In 2019, WHYY employees voted to unionize, approving their first contract two years later.

==Programs produced by WHYY==
WHYY-TV has long been a producer of PBS programming, though not to the same degree as some large-market PBS stations. At one point in the 1970s, WHYY-TV&#x27;s lone contribution to the network was the public affairs program &quot;Black Perspective on the News&quot;; however, by the start of the 1990s, WHYY was the eighth-largest supplier of program hours to PBS. Other WHYY-TV productions aired nationally have included &quot;Hometime&quot;, which ran for 30 years from 1986 to 2016; &quot;Neptune All Night&quot;, a 9-hour live TV special that aired in 1989 as Voyager 2 passed Neptune and its largest moon, Triton; &quot;The Dinosaurs!&quot; (1992), which was characterized as the station&#x27;s entry into big-budget production but marked by funding issues, delays, and the firing of its producer, Robin Bates, who called WHYY a &quot;tin-pot station&quot;; and &quot;Scenes from Modern Life&quot; (2002). The station launched &quot;Albie&#x27;s Elevator&quot; locally on WHYY-TV and nationally via YouTube in June 2023.

Additionally, the station&#x27;s old Independence Mall studios served as the original home of Nickelodeon&#x27;s game shows, including &quot;Double Dare&quot;, &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, and &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;; more than 500 episodes of five different game shows were taped by Nickelodeon at WHYY from 1986 to 1989, along with the 1992–93 Bill Cosby iteration of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;.

===Delaware programming===

Since channel 12&#x27;s move to Wilmington in 1963, the production of programming catering to Delaware interests has been part of the station&#x27;s remit. For 46 years, the flagship program covering issues in Delaware was the nightly &quot;Delaware Tonight&quot;, which began production when channel 12 was activated.

The Great Recession brought funding and budget cuts that led to a dramatic restructuring and slimming down of Wilmington operations. In June 2009, it announced &quot;Delaware Tonight&quot; would be canceled after 46 years, to be replaced with a weekly program titled &quot;First&quot; and expanded online news coverage. It also closed a Dover bureau it had opened just two years prior and put the Linden Building facility on the market, calling it expensive to operate.

The cuts led to blowback from many corners of Delaware politics and media. Longtime &quot;The News Journal&quot; columnist Harry Themal declared in a column that &quot;WHYY doesn&#x27;t care about Delaware&quot;. In December, the city of Wilmington filed a petition to deny WHYY-TV&#x27;s license renewal as a leverage move; the protest was denied in 2010. Senator Ted Kaufman, who had served on the public broadcaster&#x27;s advisory board, delivered a speech on the floor of the United States Senate calling on the FCC to require more Delaware coverage as a condition of renewal.

In 2019, WHYY&#x27;s Wilmington operations moved from the Linden Building to space in the historic Crosby and Hill Building on Market Street in the city&#x27;s LoMa district. The building houses a newsroom and radio recording studios but no television studios, with those facilities being maintained exclusively in Philadelphia.

===Local programming===
Current WHYY local programming includes a local version of the &quot;Check, Please!&quot; franchise, &quot;Check, Please! Philly&quot;, reviewing restaurants in the Philadelphia region; arts and culture profile program &quot;Movers &amp; Makers&quot;; and local feature magazine &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;.

===WDPB subchannels===
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WHYY-TV&#x27;s digital signal initially operated at so low an effective radiated power that even those who lived in some areas of the city of Philadelphia could not receive it reliably. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 12, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 55, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to VHF channel 12 for post-transition operations. After problems with VHF digital signals emerged, WHYY was permitted to increase its transmitting power upon the transition. However, the problems with digital broadcasts in the VHF spectrum remain the same at the increased power level and still prevent many people in the Philadelphia area from being able to view the high-band VHF signal of WHYY—especially when also attempting to view WPVI-TV (channel 6), a low-band VHF station that requires a different antenna configuration.

The WHYY-TV/WMCN multiplex was repacked to channel 13 in the tenth and final phase of the repack in 2020.

<doc id="461620" wikidata="Q232912" url="?curid=461620" title="Straits of Florida">
<text>The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait () is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 93 mi (150 km) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet (1,800 m). The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico.

==Oil and gas==
Five wells were drilled in state waters south of the Florida Keys from 1947 to 1962. Gulf Oil drilled three wells in federal waters south of the Florida Keys in 1960 and 1961. All the wells were dry holes.

The boundary between the Exclusive Economic Zones of the US and Cuba is halfway between Cuba and Florida, as determined by the 1977 Cuba–United States Maritime Boundary Agreement.

===Offshore Cuba===
Cuba has three producing offshore oil fields within 5 km of its north coast opposite Florida. The US Geological Survey estimates that the North Cuba Basin contains of undiscovered petroleum liquids and 9.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, almost all in the offshore part of the basin.

The issue of allowing oil and gas exploration offshore Florida became a hotly contested topic in the 2008 US elections. In a column published 5 June 2008, syndicated columnist George Will wrote that a Chinese oil company was then drilling in Cuban waters from the Florida coast, a claim that was repeated by candidates in favor of offshore drilling. In fact, no drilling was then taking place in that part of Cuban waters.

In 2004 the Spanish oil company Repsol drilled in deep Cuban waters between Cuba and the Florida Keys, and found an oil deposit; the deposit was judged noncommercial, and the hole was plugged. In October 2008, Cuba signed an agreement with the Brazilian state oil company Petrobras, which provides for Petrobras to drill for oil and gas in deep waters off the north shore of Cuba. In July 2009, Cuba signed an agreement with the Russian government giving the Russian oil company Zarubezhneft oil exploration rights off the north shore of Cuba. By May 2011 Petrobras had withdrawn from the 2008 agreement due to poor prospects.

===Offshore Bahamas===
In 2009 the Falkland Islands-registered company Bharat Petroleum Company Ltd. and Norwegian company Statoil announced a joint venture to drill for oil in Bahamian waters north of Cuba and southeast of Florida. The government of the Bahamas has indicated that applications for offshore drilling are on hold pending negotiations with Cuba, the United States, and the Turks and Caicos Islands on the exact boundaries between their respective Exclusive Economic Zones.

== Crossing ==
The swim across the strait was performed by Australian Susie Maroney (with Shark cage diving) in 1997 and American Diana Nyad (without shark cage) in 2013. Nyad, who was 64 years old at the time of the attempt, took 52 hours and 54 minutes to cover the between Havana and Key West .

<text>John Hamilton Gray (June 14, 1811 – August 13, 1887) was Premier of Prince Edward Island from 1863 – 1865 and one of the Fathers of Confederation.

Gray began his political career in 1862 when he was elected to the provincial assembly as a reformer, despite his conservative roots. He became a leading member of the opposition, with a reputation even among his opponents as a great orator. He impressed the governor so much that he was invited to become a member of the Executive Council. However, his acceptance of the position drew criticism from his reform colleagues, and gained him a reputation for vacillation that followed him for the rest of his career. Gray became the Tory leader in the assembly, but when the Liberals won a majority in 1854, he was once again relegated to the opposition. Two years later, in 1856, the provincial governor dismissed the Liberal Executive Council and replaced them with a government led by Gray.

==Early life==
John Hamilton Gray was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on June 14, 1811. His father, Robert Gray, was originally from Glasgow who emigrated to Virginia as a loyalist, then later moved to Shelburne, Nova Scotia, who moved to the island in 1787 under the invitation of Edmund Fanning. His mother&#x27;s name was Mary Burns. Gray showed an early &quot;desire for military life&quot; as a child, and completed his education in England.

==Career==
John Hamilton Gray was very educated in Charlottetown. He chose a military career, trained in England and was commissioned into the 15th Foot in 1831. He transferred to the 13th Light Dragoons later the same year, the 15th Light Dragoons in 1839, the 1st Dragoon Guards in 1840, the 14th Light Dragoons in 1841, and the 7th Dragoon Guards in 1844.

It was not long before he was asked to participate in the political life of the colony. In 1858 he was elected to represent the district of 4th Queens in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island as a Conservative. He was re-elected in 1863.

Gray was Premier of Prince Edward Island from 1863 to 1865 and during that time he attempted to alleviate the problems of the tenants by passing the fifteen-year purchase act, but the final solution of this question had to await Confederation. Gray was chairman of the 1864 Charlottetown Conference, which laid the groundwork for the British North America Act of 1867. He supported the entry of the Island into Confederation but when the Island rejected the scheme he left politics, turning the government over to James Colledge Pope.

He then returned to his first interest, the military. He was appointed adjutant-general of the PEI military in 1867 with the rank of colonel. He continued to be an administrator of military affairs until after the eventual Confederation of Prince Edward Island with Canada in 1873.

In 1887 John Hamilton Gray died at Inkerman House in Charlottetown. The name of the estate is in reference to the Battle of Inkerman where his father-in-law Sir John Pennyfeather, had lost honours to an older man. Inkerman Drive which once led to the house, is lined with trees planted by Gray and replacements of the same species, to represent the sides in the Battle. Linden on one side (Russian) and a mixture of white birch, beech, mountain ash and poplar on the other (French and English).

==Recognition and legacy==
* Colonel Gray Sr. High School, a public secondary school in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island that opened in 1966 is named in his honour.
* In 1968, a CN automobile/passenger/railcar ferry entered service carrying the name &quot;MV John Hamilton Gray&quot;, honouring both Fathers of Confederation.

<text>The Shnookums &amp; Meat Funny Cartoon Show is a half-hour American animated comedy television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and aired in 1995 as a spin-off of the show &quot;Marsupilami&quot;, a spin-off itself of &quot;Raw Toonage&quot;. The show represents Disney&#x27;s attempt to do a more &quot;edgy&quot; cartoon in the vein of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; and &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. Unlike other Disney Afternoon cartoons, &quot;Shnookums &amp; Meat&quot; only aired once a week, usually Mondays. Only thirteen episodes were produced.

==Premise==
This animated series follows three segment series.

===Shnookums &amp; Meat===
This segment involves a cat named Shnookums (voiced by Jason Marsden) and a dog named Meat (voiced by Frank Welker) who do not get along very well. Their owners are unseen stock characters only viewed from the neck down and named (appropriately enough) Husband &amp; Wife (voiced by Steve Mackall and Tress MacNeille). Husband is always referring to their home as their &quot;&quot; before the two leave their pets in charge while they are away.

===Pith Possum: Super Dynamic Possum of Tomorrow===
A spoof of the &quot;Batman&quot; comics, with the superhero Pith Possum (voiced by Jeff Bennett) and his sidekick Obediah the Wonder Raccoon (voiced by Patric Zimmerman) fighting crime in Possum City when called by the gorilla Commissioner Stress (voiced by Brad Garrett) and the monkey Lieutenant Tension (voiced by Jess Harnell). Pith Possum&#x27;s true identity is lowly tabloid copyboy Peter Possum. Pith Possum fights various enemies with his recurring one being a mad lumberjack named Dr. Paul Bunion (voiced by Jim Cummings). Pith Possum (even when in his true identity) also has developed a crush on a female human reporter named Doris Deer (voiced by April Winchell) who mostly loves Pith Possum more than his true identity. It was stated in the first episode that Pith Possum was an ordinary lab opossum until he gained ultra opossum-like abilities upon an experiment gone wrong. The titles of the episodes are completely unrelated to their contents but rather (usually) over the top titles always using the word &#x27;dark&#x27; or &#x27;darkness&#x27; and often with the words &#x27;black&#x27; and &#x27;night&#x27; (e.g., &quot;The Phantom Mask of the Dark Black Darkness of Black&quot;, &quot;Return of the Night of Blacker Darkness&quot;, &quot;Return of the Dark Mask of Phantom Blackness&quot;, etc.). Jim Cummings provided the narration in most episodes.

===Tex Tinstar: The Best in the West===
A parody of Wild West serials involving the cowboy Tex Tinstar (voiced by Jeff Bennett), his horse Here Boy, and Tex&#x27;s friends Smelly Deputy Chafe (voiced by Charlie Adler), Percy Lacedaisy (voiced by Corey Burton), and Floyd the Insane Rattlesnake (voiced by Jess Harnell) who always get into trouble when pursuing a group of outlaws called the Wrong Riders consisting of Wrongo (voiced by Brad Garrett), Ian (voiced by Corey Burton in a homage to Paul Frees&#x27; character Inspector Fenwick from &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot;), and Clem. The end of each episode ends in a cliffhanger for next week (not unlike old western serials or &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;). Jim Cummings narrated each installment in a Western accent.

==Production==
&quot;Shnookums &amp; Meat&quot; was created and written by Bill Kopp, who also created &quot;Toonsylvania&quot; and &quot;Mad Jack the Pirate&quot;. The show was directed by Jeff DeGrandis. Kopp was the voice of &quot;Eek! The Cat&quot; and Yuckie Duck from &quot;The What-A-Cartoon! Show&quot; on Cartoon Network.

The idea for a series starring a cat and dog was pitched to Kopp and DeGrandis by Greg Weisman, a development executive at Walt Disney Television Animation who was also developing &quot;Gargoyles&quot; at the time.

Disney previously reached out to Carbunkle Cartoons (one of the animation studios that worked on &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;) to work on the show&#x27;s animation, but they declined due to Disney&#x27;s unwillingness to put up the same amount of money that they received from Spumco.

==Segments on &quot;Marsupilami&quot;==

&quot;Shnookums &amp; Meat&quot; originated as a segment on Disney&#x27;s 1993 series &quot;Marsupilami&quot;. Five episodes were shown on that series, and were later run again as part of the actual &quot;Shnookums &amp; Meat&quot; series in 1995. These episodes were:
* &quot;Kung-Fu Kitty&quot;
* &quot;I.Q. You, Too&quot;
* &quot;Night of the Living Shnookums&quot;
* &quot;Something&#x27;s Fishy&quot;
* &quot;Jingle Bells, Something Smells&quot;

==Broadcast history==
The series aired on The Disney Afternoon on Mondays between January 2 and March 27, 1995, in the timeslot normally occupied by &quot;Bonkers&quot;. Reruns were later shown on Toon Disney. The Tex Tinstar segments were shown out of order on Disney Channel UK in 2003 to fill the then frequently gapped schedule. The show last aired on Friday, July 6, 2007, on Toon Disney during the Mega Jam block.

Following the launch of the Disney+ video on demand streaming service in November 2019, &quot;Shnookums and Meat&quot; along with &quot;Aladdin&quot; (based on the 1992 film of the same name) are the only Disney Afternoon series not seen yet on the platform.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===
Reviewing the series for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Scott More found the main &quot;Shnookums &amp; Meat&quot; segments to be the weakest, preferring &quot;Tex Tinstar&quot; and especially &quot;Pith Possum&quot;, singling out Jeff Bennett&#x27;s voice work on both segments for praise. Kenneth M. Chanko of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the series a positive review, stating that, while not up to the same standard as series like Warner Bros. Animation&#x27;s &quot;Animaniacs&quot; or Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, he considered it &quot;a hoot and a half&quot;. Evan Levine of the Newspaper Enterprise Association noted that his son liked it, and felt that it had good animation and clever humor, saying that &quot;kids may enjoy the freewheeling mix of physical comedy and silliness&quot;.

As of May 1995, it was reported that &quot;Shnookums &amp; Meat&quot; had a rating of 4.1/16 among kids 2–11, 4.3/18 among kids 6–11, and 1.7/13 among teenagers. Kopp had claimed in an interview with &quot;Animato!&quot; that these numbers would&#x27;ve been enough to justify a renewal on a competing network, citing Fox Kids as an example. Despite this, it was quietly cancelled after only one season; it was removed from the Disney Afternoon lineup at the start of the 1995–96 television season.

=== Comparisons ===
Martin &quot;Dr. Toon&quot; Goodman of &quot;Animation World Magazine&quot; described &quot;The Shnookums &amp; Meat Funny Cartoon Show&quot; as one of two &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; &quot;clones&quot;, with the other one being &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Hamlin&quot; (CVE-15) was one of a large group of escort aircraft carriers built on Maritime Commission C-3 hulls and transferred to the Royal Navy under Lend Lease during World War II. The ship was launched by Western Pipe and Steel Company, San Francisco, California, on 5 March 1942, as AVG-15, aircraft escort vessel. She was sponsored by Mrs. William H. Shea. Her designation was changed to ACV-15, auxiliary aircraft carrier, 20 August 1942, and she was acquired and simultaneously transferred to the United Kingdom 21 December 1942. &quot;Hamlin&quot;″s designation was changed to CVE-15, escort aircraft carrier, 15 July 1943.

Renamed HMS &quot;Stalker&quot; (D91), the escort carrier played a vital part in allied operations in the Atlantic. She participated in the Salerno landings in September 1943, providing effective on the spot air support for assault forces. &quot;Stalker&quot; also took part in the important landings in southern France in August 1944. From March to April 1945 she was attached to the 21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron. Returned to the United States 29 December 1945, she was struck from the Navy Register 20 March 1946 and sold to Waterman Steamship Corp. of Mobile, Alabama, 18 December 1946. Waterman in turn sold her to the Netherlands in August 1947 where she was converted to the merchant ship &quot;Riouw&quot;. Later renamed &quot;Lobito&quot; in 1968, she was scrapped in Taiwan in September 1975.

==Design and description==
There were eight s in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were built between 1941 and 1942 by Ingalls Shipbuilding and Western Pipe &amp; Steel shipyards in the United States, both building four ships each.

The ships had a complement of 646 men and accommodation of Royal Navy mess hall control food. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three tier bunk beds, eighteen to a cabin which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.

The ships dimensions were; an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . They had a displacement of at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the flight deck, two aircraft lifts , and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 in single mounts, eight 40 mm anti-aircraft gun in twin mounts and twenty-one 20 mm guns anti-aircraft cannons in single or twin mounts. They had the capacity for up to eighteen aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Hawker Sea Hurricane, Seafire, Vought F4U Corsair fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.
