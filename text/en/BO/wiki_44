<text>Youth in Asia were an early 1980s UK anarcho-punk band from London. They were differentiated from many other bands within that scene by their prominent use of the synthesizer. The band&#x27;s first live performance was in Brussels in December 1981. They played several gigs at squatted venues, including Crass&#x27;s squat gig at Zig Zag in London, and the Wapping Autonomy Centre with other bands including The Apostles, Crass, Flux of Pink Indians, Twelve Cubic Feet, The Mob, Poison Girls, Hagar the Womb, Riot/Clone, DIRT and others.

The band sang political lyrics about issues such as war, sexism and state terrorism. The band&#x27;s name was a play on the word euthanasia.

The initial line-up was Kay Byatt (vocals), Mark Edmondson (guitar), Wayne Preston (bass guitar), Punky Pete (drums), and Olga Ashworth (vocals/keyboards). Pete was soon replaced by Eddie on drums, and Lou, formerly of The Witches joined on rhythm guitar. In 1983, Eddie and Lou both left the band with Mick Clarke and Bernie, both previously of Windsor&#x27;s Disease, replacing them. The new line-up recorded a single for Crass Records, but the band split up before it was released, with some of the members forming a new band, Decadent Few.

Byatt later sang with Radical Dance Faction and The Astronauts. Byatt has been the primary lyricist and vocalist for Ramsgate-based anarcho-goth band Punk Con Fusion since 2012. 

==Band members==
* Kay Byatt – vocals
* Eddy – drums
* Olga Orbit – vocals, synthesizer

<text>The standard-winged nightjar (Caprimulgus longipennis) is a nocturnal bird in the nightjar family. Previously placed with the pennant-winged nightjar (&quot;Caprimulgus vexillarius&quot;) in their own genus, &quot;Macrodipteryx&quot;, it is native to Africa and displays extreme sexual dimorphism. During the breeding season, males will grow broad ornamental flight feathers longer than their body.

==Distribution and habitat==
The standard-winged nightjar is a resident breeder in Africa from southern Senegal east to Ethiopia. It spends the non-breeding season in the Sahel region to the north. Its habitat includes lightly wooded savanna, with some scrub, as well as agricultural land in thickly wooded savanna. It has been observed at elevations as high as in Ethiopia, but is typically found from sea level up to elevations of .

==Description==
When roosting on the ground during the day, this medium-sized ( long) nightjar is mainly variegated grey, with a browner collar. It has a shadowy form with easy, silent moth-like flight; this nightjar is relatively short-tailed, and lacks white in the wings or tail. The song is a churring trill.

The adult male grows a wing ornament during the breeding season which consists of a broad secondary flight feather on each wing elongated to up to , over twice the length of the bird&#x27;s body. In normal flight, these feathers trail behind, but in display flight they are displayed like standards. These large feathers have been postulated as a feature developed through intense sexual selection. Outside the breeding season, the female is distinguished from the male by its smaller size and similarity to the pennant-winged nightjar, notably the patch of white on the throat and dark barring on the belly.

==Behaviour==
Like other nightjars, the standard-winged nightjar feeds on insects in flight, their mouths opening wide for moths and beetles. It flies at dusk, when the highest quantity of prey is available, though its foraging patterns change depending on moonlight, with later, more nocturnal foraging correlated with higher levels of moonlight. It may also feed on swarms of insects disturbed by fires and artificial lights, a behaviour which has been linked to bird strike by cars when their lights illuminate roads.

During breeding season, male and (less frequently) female standard-winged nightjars will gather in patches of soil with little vegetation to forage and for males to perform display flights. Such behaviour has been considered a form of lekking. Outside of breeding season, standard-winged nightjars have been observed traveling in groups of up to 20 individual birds.

No nest is made; in each clutch, two elliptical, slightly glossy eggs are placed upon bare sandy soil.

== Nomenclature ==
Though the standard-winged nightjar was originally placed in the genus &quot;Caprimulgus&quot; as in its first identification by George Shaw in 1796, it was later placed in the genus &quot;Macrodipteryx&quot; along with the pennant-winged nightjar. A phylogenetic study done in 2010 deprecated &quot;Macrodipteryx&quot;, placing both the pennant-winged nightjar and standard-winged nightjar species within &quot;Caprimulgus&quot;. The two species are closely related, despite their differences in breeding ranges and breeding seasons.

== Ecology and conservation ==
Standard-winged nightjars are migratory birds and travel to and from breeding grounds annually. The precise breeding season varies based on region, and is affected by prey availability and rain; populations that live in more southern regions breed earlier than those in northern regions. 

The standard-winged nightjar population is not considered to be under threat and is listed as least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on the IUCN Red List.&#x27;

<text>The Santa Clause 2 (also known as The Santa Clause 2: The Mrs. Clause) is a 2002 American Christmas fantasy comedy film directed by Michael Lembeck in his directorial debut. It is the sequel to &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; (1994) and the second installment in &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; franchise. All of the principal actors from the first film, including Tim Allen, Eric Lloyd, Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson, and David Krumholtz, reprise their roles, and are joined by Elizabeth Mitchell, Spencer Breslin, and Liliana Mumy.

&quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on November 1, 2002, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 1. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $172 million worldwide on a $65 million budget. It was followed by another sequel, &quot;The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause&quot;, released in 2006.

== Plot ==

Eight years have passed since Scott Calvin took on the mantle of Santa Claus. Head Elf Bernard and Curtis, the Keeper of the &quot;Handbook of Christmas&quot;, inform Scott that there is another clause — the &quot;Mrs. Clause&quot;. Scott is now pressed to get married before the next Christmas Eve or the clause will be broken and he will stop being Santa forever. Abby the Elf simultaneously tells Scott that his teenage son Charlie is on the naughty list, due to having vandalized his school to get attention. Scott must return to his home to search for a wife and set things right with Charlie. He brings this up when visited by the Council of Legendary Figures, consisting of Mother Nature, Father Time, Cupid, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman. To cover for Santa&#x27;s prolonged absence, Curtis helps Scott create a life-sized animatronic Santa clone, much to Bernard&#x27;s horror. However, at Santa&#x27;s request, Bernard reluctantly plays along, and tells the other elves that Santa had a makeover, so they will not question the double&#x27;s synthetic appearance.

Because of the impending end of his contract, Scott undergoes a &quot;de-Santafication process&quot; that gradually turns him back into Scott Calvin. He has a limited amount of magic to help him. Scott returns home to his former wife Laura, her husband Neil, their six-year-old daughter Lucy, and Charlie. He and Charlie face the ire of school principal Carol Newman when Charlie defaces the lockers.

At the North Pole, Toy Santa follows the rulebook too literally and begins to think that everyone in the world is naughty because of their small mistakes. As a result, Toy Santa takes over the North Pole using giant toy soldiers he made himself and unveils his plan to the elves to give lumps of coal to the world. Bernard exposes Toy Santa as a fraud, and Toy Santa places him under house arrest.

After a few failed dates, Scott finds himself falling for Carol. He accompanies her in a horse-drawn sleigh to the faculty Christmas party, during which she confesses she used to believe in Santa as a child, until she was forced to stop doing so by her parents after fighting with children who told her Santa was not real. Using a little of his Christmas magic, Scott enlivens the otherwise dull party by presenting everyone with their childhood dream gifts. He makes a special presentation to Carol, and, with his last remnant of magic, wins her over and they kiss under mistletoe. However, when Scott attempts to explain to her that he is Santa, she believes that he is mocking her childhood, and throws him out. Later, Charlie is upset about Scott dating his principal and he confesses how hard it is for him that Scott is never around like other fathers, and reveals the pressure he is under to conceal the secret that his father is Santa. Lucy convinces Charlie not to be mad at him, which leads Charlie to convince Carol that Scott is Santa by showing her the magic snow globe he received during Scott&#x27;s initial transformation.

Curtis flies in to tell Scott about Toy Santa&#x27;s plan. However, Scott has used up the last of his magic wooing Carol, and cannot return to the North Pole. With help from the Tooth Fairy, Scott and Curtis manage to get back, only for Toy Santa to find them and tie them up. Charlie and Carol spring them free by summoning the Tooth Fairy to fly them to the North Pole. Scott goes after Toy Santa, who has already left with the sleigh, riding Chet, a rambunctious reindeer-in-training, and they both crash back into the village. With an army of elves, Carol, Bernard, Charlie, and Curtis lead them into a snowball fight to overthrow the toy soldiers. Toy Santa is defeated and reduced to a six-inch height, Scott marries Carol in a ceremony, Scott transforms back into Santa and Carol transforms into Mrs. Claus, and Christmas proceeds as it always has. Scott and Charlie reveal the truth to Lucy about Scott being Santa Claus, promising to keep his secret.

== Cast ==
===Reindeer voice cast===
* Bob Bergen as Comet
* Kath Soucie as Chet

== Production ==
In July 2000, it was announced Disney intended to move forward with a sequel to &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; with the initial draft written by Don Rhymer where the North Pole is operating at maximum efficiency until Santa is confronted with the challenge of balancing work and personal life. Michael Lembeck became attached to direct in November of that year. In April 2001, Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio were brought on by Disney to pen another draft of the sequel.

The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia and at Mammoth Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia.

A teaser trailer for this film released with &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; and &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; in late 2000 originally referred to it as &quot;Santa Clause 2: The Escape Clause&quot;, scheduled for release on November 21, 2001. The subtitle would later become the subtitle of the following sequel in 2006.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though it&#x27;s harmless as family entertainment and has moments of charm, &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; is also predictable and forgettable.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; found it &quot;more engaging, assured and funny&quot; than the first film, with a &quot;nice acerbic undertone&quot;. Keith Phipps for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;Despite the obviously mercenary nature of this sequel, there&#x27;s a thimbleful of clever ideas at work here, most notably in the way Allen&#x27;s RoboSanta begins to turn his toy factory into a tiny dictatorship.&quot; Claudia Puig called it a &quot;trite, predictable rehash.&quot;

&quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, but lost to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;.

=== Box office ===
During its opening weekend, &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; generated $29 million, more than its predecessor, and was ranked in first place at the box office ahead of &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;I Spy&quot;. While the film was overtaken by &quot;8 Mile&quot; a week later, it still made a total of $24.7 million. It would later go on to compete against &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. These three sequels would win the Thanksgiving weekend. The film would run strong at the box office while dominating Disney&#x27;s other film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;. &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; grossed $139.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $33.6 million in other territories, for a total of $172.8 million, against a production budget of $65 million. It was the fifth-highest-grossing holiday movie.

== Soundtrack ==

== Home media ==
&quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on November 18, 2003. The DVD release is THX certified and consists of widescreen and pan and scan fullscreen versions.

<text>Meadow&#x27;s Law is a now-discredited legal concept once used to adjudicate cases involving multiple instances of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as crib or cot deaths, linked to a single caregiver. Due to the rarity and often inexplicable nature of these deaths, the law posited that &quot;one&quot; &quot;sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder until proved otherwise.&quot; Now recognized as fundamentally flawed and based on misunderstanding of statistics, Meadow&#x27;s Law has been heavily criticized for leading to wrongful convictions and accusations.

== History ==
The name is derived from the controversial British paediatrician Roy Meadow, who until 2003 was seen by many as &quot;Britain&#x27;s most eminent paediatrician&quot; and leading expert on child abuse. Meadow&#x27;s reputation went into decline with a series of legal reverses for his theories, and in July 2005 he was struck off the medical register by the General Medical Council for tendering misleading evidence. Meadow&#x27;s licence was reinstated in February 2006 by a London court.

Meadow attributes many unexplained infant deaths to the disorder or condition in mothers called Munchausen syndrome by proxy. According to this diagnosis some parents, especially mothers, harm or even kill their children as a means of calling attention to themselves. Its existence has been confirmed by cases where parents have been caught on video surveillance actively harming their children, but its frequency is subject to debate as Meadow claimed to have destroyed the original data which he used to substantiate the law.

As a result of the 1993 trial of Beverley Allitt, a paediatric nurse convicted of killing four children under her care and injuring five others, Meadow&#x27;s ideas gained ascendancy in British child protection circles, and mothers were convicted of murder on the basis of his expert testimony. Thousands of children were removed from their parents and taken into care or fostered out because they were deemed to be &#x27;at risk&#x27;. From 2003, however, the tide of opinion turned: a number of high-profile acquittals cast doubt on the validity of &#x27;Meadow&#x27;s Law&#x27;. Several convictions were reversed, and many more came under review.

=== Attribution to the Di Maios ===
In a note to his mathematical analysis of the Sally Clark case, Professor Ray Hill endorses a claim that Meadow did not originate the rule:

The precept was published in the United States by DiMaio and DiMaio in 1989, without mention of Meadow. In &quot;ABC of Child Abuse&quot;, first published in the same year, Meadow wrote his formulation:
The formula is &quot;clearly fallacious&quot; according to Bob Carpenter, Professor of Medical Statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, an expert witness in some of the trials where infant cot deaths were prosecuted as homicides.

== Criticisms ==
Critics of Meadow&#x27;s law state that it is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of statistics, particularly relating to probability, likelihood, and statistical independence.

At the trial in 1999 of solicitor Sally Clark, accused of murdering her two sons, Meadow testified that the odds against two such deaths happening naturally was 73,000,000:1, a figure which he obtained by squaring the observed ratio of births to cot-deaths in affluent non-smoking families (approximately 8,500:1).

This caused an uproar among professional statisticians, whose criticisms were twofold:

=== The prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy ===
Firstly, Meadow was accused of espousing the so-called prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy in which the probability of &quot;cause given effect&quot; (i.e. the true likelihood of a suspect&#x27;s innocence) is confused with that of &quot;effect given cause&quot; (the likelihood that innocence will result in the observed double-cot-death). In reality, these quantities can only be equated when the likelihood of the alternative hypothesis, in this case murder, is close to certainty. Since murder (and especially double murder) is itself a rare event, the probability of Clark&#x27;s innocence was certainly far greater than Meadow&#x27;s figure suggested.

An equivalent error is to accuse anybody who wins a lottery of fraud.

=== Statistical independence ===
The second criticism was that Meadow&#x27;s calculation had assumed that cot deaths within a single family were statistically independent events, governed by a probability common to the entire affluent non-smoking population. No account had been taken of conditions specific to individual families (such as a hypothesised &quot;cot death gene&quot;) which might make some more vulnerable than others. The occurrence of one cot-death makes it likely that such conditions exist, and the probability of subsequent deaths is therefore greater than the group average (estimates are mostly in the region of 1:100).

Combining these corrections with estimates of successive murder probabilities by affluent non-smokers, Mathematics Professor Ray Hill found that the probability of Clark&#x27;s guilt could be as low as 10% (based solely on the fact of two unexplained child deaths, and before any other evidence was considered). In any case, a legal verdict is not to be rendered on the basis of statistics; Hill wrote, &quot;guilt must be proved on the basis of forensic and other evidence and not on the basis of these statistics alone. My own personal view that she is innocent is based on my subjective assessment of all the aspects&quot;.

<text>The Arado Ar 68 was a single-seat biplane fighter designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Arado Flugzeugwerke. It was among the first fighters produced when Germany abandoned the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and began rearming.

The Ar 68 was a part of Arado&#x27;s continuing fighter development programme, being designed during the early 1930s as a biplane of relatively standard construction. Both the Rolls-Royce Kestrel and BMW VI selected to power the type proved to be inferior in terms of high altitude performance to the newer Junkers Jumo 210, however, due to limited availability of that only, only late production Ar 68s were outfitted with this powerplant. In addition to its twin 7.92 mm (0.312 in) MG 17 machine guns, some aircraft were provisioned with a compact bomb bay. While the Ar 68 possessed favourable handling characteristics, some officials were concerned that the unforgiving nature of high-performance aircraft would make the aircraft unsuitable, allegedly nearly causing production to be terminated.

The prototype made its maiden flight in early 1934; Chief of the Technical Office Ernst Udet personally flew the aircraft, during which the competing Heinkel He 51 proved to be outclassed. During 1936, the Ar 68 entered service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;; two years later, it was used by Condor Legion in active combat during the Spanish Civil War. In response to the Soviet Polikarpov I-16, Arado upgraded the engine of the Ar 68E, which was the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s most widely used fighter during 1937–1938. The type was eclipsed by the Messerschmitt Bf 109, a monoplane fighter, prior to the outbreak of the Second World War; however, it continued to be operated, mainly as a trainer, as late as 1944.

==Design and development==
===Background===
During the early to mid 1920s, the German aircraft manufacturer Arado had, in conformance with the restrictions on Germany&#x27;s aviation industry enacted by the Treaty of Versailles, largely focused upon the civil aviation market. However, the company quickly recognised the opportunities available from the Reichswehr (German armed forces), particularly during the 1926-1929 rearmament programme. One initiative of this programme was the development of military prototypes that could, in the event of conflict breaking out, be promptly put into mass production. Furthermore, the Reichswehr was quietly re-establishing a secret air force under the guise of setting up &#x27;display squadrons&#x27;. Despite these ambitions, government funding for aviation was limited, and several of the larger German aircraft manufacturers saw little value in producing prototype military aircraft with seemingly little chance of a production order following.

Work on what would become the Ar 68 started in 1932 as part of the company&#x27;s continuing development programme for fighter designs. As favoured by one of Arado&#x27;s senior design team members, the aeronautical engineer Walter Rethel, it was a biplane of standard construction. The lower wing was larger than the upper wing, which was necessary for the full-span flaps to be effective, although this negatively impacted the effectiveness of the ailerons on the upper wing. While the Rolls-Royce Kestrel selected to initially power the new aircraft, it was less powerful than the BMW VI of the preceding Ar 65 yet the Ar 68 was predicted to be faster due to its lower weight and aerodymanic improvements. Construction of a single prototype commenced in 1933.

There were no major changes in construction between the different Ar 68 models, comprising steel tubing and a metal-plated exterior from the cockpit forwards, while the sides and underside of the fuselage were covered by fabric. While the winds and empennage control surfaces were also clad in fabric, metal plating covered the tailplane and fin. Armament consisted of a pair of 7.92 mm (0.312 in) MG 17 machine guns, although some aircraft were furnished with a compact bomb bay capable of accommodating up to six SC 10 fragmentation bombs. The minimisation of tension cables and the fuselage shape gave the Ar 68 as relatively elegant appearance.

===Into flight===
Performing its maiden flight in early 1934, the Ar 68 quickly proved to possess admirable handling characteristics, being fairly maneouverable yet not prone to spinning. Chief of the Technical Office Ernst Udet personally made an early flight in the aircraft, during which he outperformed a Heinkel He 51 in a mock dogfight. Despite this favourable outcome, some officials expressed concerns about the unforgiving nature of such a high-performance aircraft, to the extent that production of Ar 68 was allegedly nearly cancelled entirely.

The Ar 68 competed with the somewhat similar He 51, the first prototypes of each aircraft even adopted the same BMW VI powerplant, albeit with different installation arrangements. While the first and fourth Ar 68 prototypes was powered by the BMW VI, the second, third, and fifth prototypes were powered by the newly-developed Junkers Jumo 210 inverted V12 engine, which provided substantially greater high altitude performance than either the Kestrel or BMW VI. Despite its performance advantages, limited availability of the Jumo 210 led to the Ar 68&#x27;s early production run making use of the BMW VI instead.

By April 1936, Arado had planned for a total production run of 324 Ar 68s, 302 of which were delivered prior to the year&#x27;s end. By 31 March 1938, 514 aircraft had been completed, at which point the production line was shuttered. Quantity production had not been entirely without complications; the planned Ar 68G model was cancelled due to the unavailability of a suitable engine.

The Ar 68 entered service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in early 1936; one of the first units to receive the type was stationed in East Prussia. One early event that involved two squadrons equipped with the type was the Remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936. During 1938, it was decided to dispatch Ar 68s with the Condor Legion to fight in the Spanish Civil War, where it was outclassed by the Soviet Polikarpov I-16. Arado responded by upgrading the engine of the Ar 68E, which soon became the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s most widely used fighter in 1937–1938, before being replaced by the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The last Ar 68s served as night fighters up to the winter of 1939–1940. Several Ar 68E-1s served with 10. and 11. (Nachtjagd)/JG 72, and a few Ar 68F-1s with 10. (Nachtjagd)/JG 53 after which they served as fighter-trainers until 1944.

<text>J. Lamar Worzel (February 21, 1919 – December 26, 2008) was an American geophysicist known for his important contributions to underwater acoustics, underwater photography, and gravity measurements at sea.

==Life==
Worzel was born on February 21, 1919, in Staten Island, New York. His father was a real-estate lawyer.

Worzel, was a graduate of Lehigh University. There he met Dr. Maurice Ewing with whom he had a forty-year working relationship. He had a long and notable career as a research scientist and professor of oceanography at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution before following Ewing to the new Lamont Geological Observatory at Columbia University. He conducted annual research on many ships, including the Vema, which set the stage for the rapid advances in marine geology and geophysics in the late 1940s and 1950s. Along with Ewing and Alan Vine, he built the first camera designed to go to a depth of 3000 fathoms (5.5 km), in 1939.

Together with Ewing, he discovered &quot;shadow zones&quot; in the oceans that were not accessible to sonar detection as well as &quot;deep sound channels&quot; that transmit low frequency sounds for long distances. Such discoveries were of military significance and the basis for the development of the Sofar channel program of the US Navy. Other achievements included the precise measurement of the earth&#x27;s gravity field from surface ships, previously hampered by the inherent instability of ship platforms.

In 1963 he led a team conducting an acoustic investigation which later found the remains of the nuclear powered submarine USS Thresher (SSN 593), lost after deep diving trials.

He was a Gravity Specialist and Co-Chief Scientist and eventually Associate Director at Lamont Geological Observatory (now known as Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory), director of the Marine Science Institute Geophysical Laboratory at Galveston, Texas, from 1975–79, vice-president of Society of Exploration Geophysicists (1978–79), and principal investigator of the drilling program on the Blake plateau region off Jacksonville, Florida, in 1965. Worzel is a cofounder of the Palisades Geophysical Institute and served as its president from 1974 until 2002 when he disbanded it as he felt the research was too focused on weaponry. Worzel was a fellow of the American Geophysical Union.

His work had both military and peaceful implications. With Ewing he established that the sea floor is not a former sunken continent but an original ocean basin. Today, the J. Lamar Worzel Assistant Scientist Fund is a US$1 million fund that supports young scientists pursuing careers in geophysical oceanography at Woods Hole. Additionally, the Maurice Ewing and J. Lamar Worzel Professorship of Geophysics at Columbia University in New York is named in his honor.

He was married to the former Dorothy Crary.

<text>Application [[software]] is any computer program that is intended for end-user use not operating, administering or programming the computer. An application (app, application program, software application) is any program that can be categorized as application software. Common types of applications include word processor, media player and accounting software. 

The term &quot;application software&quot; refers to all applications collectively and can be used to differentiate from system and utility software.

Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately. Applications may be proprietary or open-source.

The short term &quot;app&quot; (coined in 1981 or earlier) became popular with the 2008 introduction of the iOS App Store, to refer to applications for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Later, with introduction of the Mac App Store (in 2010) and Windows Store (in 2011), the term was extended in popular use to include desktop applications.

== Terminology ==
The delineation between system software such as operating systems and application software is not exact, however, and is occasionally the object of controversy. For example, one of the key questions in the &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot; antitrust trial was whether Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer web browser was part of its Windows operating system or a separate piece of application software. As another example, the GNU/Linux naming controversy is, in part, due to disagreement about the relationship between the Linux kernel and the operating systems built over this kernel. In some types of embedded systems, the application software and the operating system software may be indistinguishable from the user, as in the case of software used to control a VCR, DVD player, or microwave oven. The above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers in large organizations. For an alternative definition of an app: &quot; see Application Portfolio Management.&quot;

When used as an adjective, &quot;application&quot; is not restricted to mean: of or on application software. For example, concepts such as application programming interface (API), application server, application virtualization, application lifecycle management and portable application apply to all computer programs alike, not just application software.

===Killer app===

Sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform that results in increasing the desirability of that platform. This is called a killer application or &quot;killer app&quot;, coined in the late 1980s. For example, VisiCalc was the first modern spreadsheet software for the Apple II and helped sell the then-new personal computers into offices. For the BlackBerry, it was its email software.

===Platform specific naming===

Some applications are available for multiple platforms while others only work on one and are thus called, for example, a geography application &quot;for Microsoft Windows&quot;, or an &quot;Android&quot; application for education, or a &quot;Linux&quot; game.

== Classification ==
There are many different and alternative ways to classify application software.

From the legal point of view, application software is mainly classified with a black-box approach, about the rights of its end-users or subscribers (with eventual intermediate and tiered subscription levels).

Software applications are also classified with respect to the programming language in which the source code is written or executed, and concerning their purpose and outputs.

=== By property and use rights ===
Application software is usually distinguished into two main classes: closed source vs open source software applications, and free or proprietary software applications.

Proprietary software is placed under the exclusive copyright, and a software license grants limited usage rights. The open-closed principle states that software may be &quot;open only for extension, but not for modification&quot;. Such applications can only get add-ons from third parties.

Free and open-source software (FOSS) shall be run, distributed, sold, or extended for any purpose, and -being open- shall be modified or reversed in the same way.

FOSS software applications released under a free license may be perpetual and also royalty-free. Perhaps, the owner, the holder or third-party enforcer of any right (copyright, trademark, patent, or &quot;ius in re aliena&quot;) are entitled to add exceptions, limitations, time decays or expiring dates to the license terms of use.

Public-domain software is a type of FOSS which is royalty-free and - openly or reservedly- can be run, distributed, modified, reversed, republished, or created in derivative works without any copyright attribution and therefore revocation. It can even be sold, but without transferring the public domain property to other single subjects. Public-domain SW can be released under a (un)licensing legal statement, which enforces those terms and conditions for an indefinite duration (for a lifetime, or forever).

=== By coding language ===
Since the development and near-universal adoption of the web, an important distinction that has emerged, has been between web applications — written with HTML, JavaScript and other web-native technologies and typically requiring one to be online and running a web browser — and the more traditional native applications written in whatever languages are available for one&#x27;s particular type of computer. There has been a contentious debate in the computing community regarding web applications replacing native applications for many purposes, especially on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Web apps have indeed greatly increased in popularity for some uses, but the advantages of applications make them unlikely to disappear soon, if ever. Furthermore, the two can be complementary, and even integrated.

=== By purpose and output ===
Application software can also be seen as being either horizontal or vertical. Horizontal applications are more popular and widespread, because they are general purpose, for example word processors or databases. Vertical applications are niche products, designed for a particular type of industry or business, or department within an organization. Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for example, manufacturing or banking worker, accounting, or customer service.

There are many types of application software:

* An &quot;application suite&quot; consists of multiple applications bundled together. They usually have related functions, features, and user interfaces, and may be able to interact with each other, e.g. open each other&#x27;s files. Business applications often come in suites, e.g. Microsoft Office, LibreOffice and iWork, which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, etc.; but suites exist for other purposes, e.g. graphics or music.
* &quot;Enterprise software&quot; addresses the needs of an entire organization&#x27;s processes and data flows, across several departments, often in a large distributed environment. Examples include enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, data replication engines, and supply chain management software. Departmental Software is a sub-type of enterprise software with a focus on smaller organizations or groups within a large organization. (Examples include travel expense management and IT Helpdesk.)
* &quot;Enterprise infrastructure software&quot; provides common capabilities needed to support enterprise software systems. (Examples include databases, email servers, and systems for managing networks and security.)
*&quot;Application platform as a service (aPaaS)&quot; is a cloud computing service that offers development and deployment environments for application services.
* &quot;Information worker software&quot; lets users create and manage information, often for individual projects within a department, in contrast to enterprise management. Examples include time management, resource management, analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information systems, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.
* &quot;Content access software&quot; is used primarily to access content without editing, but may include software that allows for content editing. Such software addresses the needs of individuals and groups to consume digital entertainment and published digital content. (Examples include media players, web browsers, and help browsers.)
* &quot;Educational software&quot; is related to content access software, but has the content or features adapted for use by educators or students. For example, it may deliver evaluations (tests), track progress through material, or include collaborative capabilities.
* &quot;Simulation software&quot; simulates physical or abstract systems for either research, training, or entertainment purposes.
* &quot;Media development software&quot; generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. This includes graphic-art software, desktop publishing software, multimedia development software, HTML editors, digital-animation editors, digital audio and video composition, and many others.

=== By platform ===
Applications can also be classified by computing platforms such as a desktop application for a particular operating system, delivery network such as in cloud computing and Web 2.0 applications, or delivery devices such as mobile apps for mobile devices.

The operating system itself can be considered application software when performing simple calculating, measuring, rendering, and word processing tasks not used to control hardware via a command-line interface or graphical user interface. This does not include application software bundled within operating systems such as a software calculator or text editor.

<doc id="454748" wikidata="Q1956793" url="?curid=454748" title="Category of abelian groups">
<text>In mathematics, the category Ab has the abelian groups as objects and group homomorphisms as morphisms. This is the prototype of an abelian category: indeed, every small abelian category can be embedded in Ab.

== Properties ==
The zero object of Ab is the trivial group {0} which consists only of its neutral element.

The monomorphisms in Ab are the injective group homomorphisms, the epimorphisms are the surjective group homomorphisms, and the isomorphisms are the bijective group homomorphisms.

Ab is a full subcategory of Grp, the category of &quot;all&quot; groups. The main difference between Ab and Grp is that the sum of two homomorphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; between abelian groups is again a group homomorphism:

:(&quot;f&quot;+&quot;g&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;) + &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) + &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) 
:       = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) + &quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = (&quot;f&quot;+&quot;g&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) + (&quot;f&quot;+&quot;g&quot;)(&quot;y&quot;)

The third equality requires the group to be abelian. This addition of morphism turns Ab into a preadditive category, and because the direct sum of finitely many abelian groups yields a biproduct, we indeed have an additive category.

In Ab, the notion of kernel in the category theory sense coincides with kernel in the algebraic sense, i.e. the categorical kernel of the morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is the subgroup &quot;K&quot; of &quot;A&quot; defined by &quot;K&quot; = {&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot; : &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0}, together with the inclusion homomorphism &quot;i&quot; : &quot;K&quot; → &quot;A&quot;. The same is true for cokernels; the cokernel of &quot;f&quot; is the quotient group &quot;C&quot; = &quot;B&quot; / &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) together with the natural projection &quot;p&quot; : &quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot;. (Note a further crucial difference between Ab and Grp: in Grp it can happen that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is not a normal subgroup of &quot;B&quot;, and that therefore the quotient group &quot;B&quot; / &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) cannot be formed.) With these concrete descriptions of kernels and cokernels, it is quite easy to check that Ab is indeed an abelian category. 

The forgetful functor from formula_1Mod to Ab that sends a formula_1-module formula_3 to its underlying abelian group formula_4 and the functor from Ab to formula_1 that sends an abelian group formula_6 to the formula_1-module formula_8 obtained by setting formula_9 define an isomorphism of categories.

The product in Ab is given by the product of groups, formed by taking the Cartesian product of the underlying sets and performing the group operation componentwise. Because Ab has kernels, one can then show that Ab is a complete category. The coproduct in Ab is given by the direct sum; since Ab has cokernels, it follows that Ab is also cocomplete.

We have a forgetful functor Ab → Set which assigns to each abelian group the underlying set, and to each group homomorphism the underlying function. This functor is faithful, and therefore Ab is a concrete category. The forgetful functor has a left adjoint (which associates to a given set the free abelian group with that set as basis) but does not have a right adjoint.

Taking direct limits in Ab is an exact functor. Since the group of integers Z serves as a generator, the category Ab is therefore a Grothendieck category; indeed it is the prototypical example of a Grothendieck category.

An object in Ab is injective if and only if it is a divisible group; it is projective if and only if it is a free abelian group. The category has a projective generator (Z) and an injective cogenerator (Q/Z). 

Given two abelian groups &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, their tensor product &quot;A&quot;⊗&quot;B&quot; is defined; it is again an abelian group. With this notion of product, Ab is a closed symmetric monoidal category.

Ab is not a topos since e.g. it has a zero object.

<text>Kingdom Come is a four-issue comic book miniseries published in 1996 by DC Comics under their Elseworlds imprint. It was written by Mark Waid and painted in gouache by Alex Ross, who also developed the concept from an original idea. 

The story is set in an alternate future of the DC Universe. The new generation of heroes have lost their moral compass, becoming as reckless and violent as the villains they fight. The previous regime of heroes—the Justice League—returns under dire circumstances, which sets up a battle of the old guard against these uncompromising protectors in a conflict that will define what heroism truly is and determine the future of the planet.

==Development==
When comic book artist Alex Ross was working on &quot;Marvels&quot;, published in 1994, he decided to create a similar &quot;grand opus&quot; about characters from DC Comics. Ross wrote a 40-page handwritten outline of what would become &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; and pitched the idea to James Robinson as a project similar in scope to &quot;Watchmen&quot; (1986–1987) and Alan Moore&#x27;s infamous &quot;lost work&quot; &quot;Twilight of the Superheroes&quot;. Ultimately, Ross teamed with writer Mark Waid, who was recommended by DC editors due to his strong familiarity with the history of DC superheroes.

==Plot==
In the near future, the new generation of metahumans becomes increasingly violent and reckless, engaging in destructive battles with little distinction between heroes and villains. Notably, 10 years ago, a superhero named Magog kills the Joker in retaliation for a mass murder of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; staff, including Lois Lane. Magog being acquitted during the trial and subsequently gaining public support prompts Superman to retire and Wonder Woman to be exiled from Themyscira, with other superheroes following suit. With the apocalypse drawing near, the Spectre recruits minister Norman McCay, having received visions from a dying Wesley Dodds, to help pass judgement when the moment arrives.
An attack on the Parasite in Kansas, led by Magog, goes awry when Parasite tears open Captain Atom. Much of the American Midwest is irradiated, killing millions and devastating the economy. Coaxed back into action by Wonder Woman, Superman returns to Metropolis and re-forms the Justice League. He begins recruiting several heroes to his cause, stopping battles around the world while facing opposition from Wonder Woman&#x27;s militant leadership style. In response to Superman&#x27;s idealist notions and embittered by his decision to abandon humanity, Batman forms his own network of heroes called the Outsiders, and Lex Luthor organizes the Mankind Liberation Front (MLF), a group of classic and third-generation villains who works to take back control of the world from heroes, with defeating the Justice League as its priority.

Superman&#x27;s Justice League gathers more captives than converts, and after talking to Orion, who has succeded his father Darkseid as the leader of Apokolips, he builds a prison on the wastelands of Magog&#x27;s fight with Parasite. His prison, nicknamed the Gulag, is quickly filled to capacity. His attempts to convince the inmates to redeem themselves fails, and pressure starts to build between the heroes and villains locked inside. Batman and his Outsiders reluctantly ally themselves with the MLF, and Batman learns that Luthor has brainwashed Billy Batson to his side. When the inmates riot and kill Captain Comet, Luthor reveals that he intends to use Batson to break open the Gulag and incite a battle between the inmates and the Justice League. The Outsiders ambush the MLF, and although Batman confronts Billy, he transforms into Captain Marvel and flies off.

While Wonder Woman leads the Justice League to stop the prison riot, Superman confronts Batman and tries to convince him one last time to fight. Moved by Superman&#x27;s sentiments, he tells him that Captain Marvel is on his way to the Gulag, and later enters the battle with the Outsiders as Superman and Captain Marvel fight. The United Nations authorizes the deployment of three nuclear warheads on the battlegrounds to defeat the metahumans once and for all. Batman and Wonder Woman stop two bombs from deploying but miss one. Seeing the third one about to land, Superman plans to stop the last bomb, and reverts Captain Marvel back to Billy Batson. Norman is given his opportunity to pass judgement, and, having experienced life as a mortal and as a superhero, Batson is presented with a choice: Either let the bomb hit and free humans of being controlled by superheroes, or destroy it and let the battle rage across the world. He chooses the second option, sacrificing himself to let the bomb detonate prematurely.

Despite Batson&#x27;s sacrifice, most of the metahumans are still obliterated in the explosion. Blinded by rage, Superman flies to the UN&#x27;s headquarters and threatens to kill the delegates as punishment for the massacre. Norman tells Superman to back down, reminding him of the fear his actions can instill onto others. Superman stops his rampage, admitting that these events were caused by his inability to adapt to the future, and promises to work alongside the surviving heroes and humans to better humanity. Wonder Woman&#x27;s exile ends as she helps rehabilitate the surviving metahumans, and Batman gives up his crusade on crime and turns his manor into a hospital. Superman begins restoring the farmlands destroyed by Magog in the battle with Parasite, reconciling with his past after being gifted a pair of glasses by Wonder Woman. Norman resumes his pastorship, delivering a message of hope for humanity.

In an epilogue scene, Clark Kent and Diana Prince meet with Bruce Wayne at the superhero-themed restaurant Planet Krypton. Bruce deduces that they are expecting a child, and Diana asks him to serve as his godfather. While Bruce is initially surprised, Clark tells him that he still trusts him, even after all these years, and that he can count on him to be a balancing force for the child. Bruce agrees, and as the three leave the restaurant, he notices Norman and Jim Corrigan, the Spectre&#x27;s host, discussing a menu item named after him.

===&quot;The Kingdom&quot;===

Due to the popularity of the series, Mark Waid and Alex Ross began to plot a sequel/prequel titled &quot;The Kingdom&quot;. Alex Ross&#x27;s original intent was for Gog to be an alien, twice the size of a human, from the planet Urgrund that split into two and created Apokolips and New Genesis and for Magog to be the grown son of Superman and Wonder Woman, who would be mentored by Gog. Waid and Ross disagreed on several concepts, and Ross decided to leave the project.

Without Ross&#x27;s involvement, Waid continued the story in the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Evil: Gog&quot; one-shot. &quot;The Kingdom&quot; miniseries soon followed, featuring a two-part series and several one-shots focusing on specific characters. The series was used to present Grant Morrison&#x27;s Hypertime concept.

===&quot;Thy Kingdom Come&quot;===
The final issue of &quot;52&quot; reveals that Earth-22 is the designation of the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; alternate universe.

In &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3), a new Starman appears wearing a costume identical to that of the Starman from the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; series. It is soon revealed that this individual is the Starman from &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; and that he is also Legion of Super-Heroes member Thom Kallor. Due to a time-travel error, Starman traveled to Earth-22 before arriving in 21st-century New Earth.

The &quot;Thy Kingdom Come&quot; story arc of the &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; title features the involvement of Alex Ross, as well as the appearance of the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; Superman. Seeing the connection between Gog of New Earth and Magog of Earth-22, Superman from Earth-22 and the JSA seek to prevent New Earth from going the way of his own world by stopping Gog in his crusade to rid the world of false gods, and before he can choose a successor one day in Magog. The JSA is split in their opinions on Gog; some believe he is truly benevolent, while others are suspicious of his true intentions. To prove himself, Gog heals certain JSA members such as Starman, Doctor Mid-Nite, and Damage, and he resurrects Lance to make him his successor, Magog.

Soon, the JSA learns that Gog is forming a parasitic relationship with the planet Earth. If he remains long enough, the planet will not be able to survive without him. The JSA remove Gog&#x27;s head, and Superman and Starman take it to the Source Wall. Starman sends Superman back to Earth-22 in time to see the carnage caused by Captain Marvel detonating the bomb. The events of &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; continue from there and conclude in its entirety, with additional scenes depicting Superman&#x27;s life and legacy for the next 1,000 years.

Alex Ross states that this story is not intended as a sequel to &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; since that would negate the purpose of the original story.

===&quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;===
A major subplot of Judd Winick and Keith Giffen&#x27;s 2010 maxiseries, &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot; concerns the events of &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. The story sees Maxwell Lord being tasked by the Entity with killing Magog before he can inadvertently trigger an apocalyptic war between Earth&#x27;s superhumans, which ultimately brings Magog and Lord into conflict with Justice League International. To drive the point home, the Entity shows Lord a series of visions taken directly from &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, including Magog and the Justice Battalion attacking Parasite. Lord eventually succeeds in arranging Magog&#x27;s demise, and his life is returned by the Entity.

===&quot;Superman/Batman&quot;===

During the first arc of the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; series written by Jeph Loeb, what appears to be the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; Superman appears in the Batcave with the intent to kill Clark Kent, because according to him, Clark is responsible for the destruction of the Earth. &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; Superman suddenly vanishes while being distracted by his past self calling him &quot;Clark&quot;. It is eventually revealed that this Superman came from a future in which a kryptonite meteorite crashed to Earth.

Later, due to a burst of quantum energy, Captain Atom arrives in this future. With advice from this future Superman, he returns to the present and destroys the meteor, preventing the bad future.

In a follow-up to this story, &quot;Captain Atom: Armageddon&quot;, the titular Captain Atom finds himself in the WildStorm universe and in another homage to &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, his appearance mysteriously changes to that of his Earth-22 counterpart.

=== &quot;Batman/Superman: World&#x27;s Finest&quot; ===
In the second arc of &quot;Batman/Superman: World&#x27;s Finest&quot;, entitled &quot;Strange Visitor&quot; and written by Mark Waid and illustrated by Dan Mora, a young boy named David Sikela arrives on Earth-0, where he is found by Batman, Superman, and Robin. They quickly realized the unique properties of David&#x27;s biology give him powers upon exposure to the Earth&#x27;s sun, and is brought to Kandor to be examined by the Kandorian scientist Kim-Da. While there, Kim-Da fabricates David a costume inspired by Hel-Oz, an ancient Kryptonian hero. After a brief, but traumatic, excursion to Gotham, Robin takes David to the base of the Teen Titans, where he introduces David to his friends and partners. David joins the Titans and becomes Superman&#x27;s sidekick, Boy Thunder.

While things start out well, a team-up between the Joker and the Key results in David being tortured by the Joker, which heavily traumatized him. In a fit of rage, David attempts to kill the Joker. While he was unsuccessful, David vows that he will one day kill the Joker, as it is revealed he is a younger version of Magog. David&#x27;s actions concern Superman, Batman and the Titans, with Superman briefly considering siphoning David&#x27;s powers, but decided against it, believing that David deserved a chance to fix his mistakes. The Key took this opportunity to attempt to use David&#x27;s ship to unlock the secrets of the multiverse, triggering the ship&#x27;s systems and causing it and David to be transported into an unknown world in the Multiverse, where he meets an alien being going by the name of Gog.

==Collected editions==

A boxed-set of the four individual issues was packaged in a die-cut cardboard sleeve with a Skybox trading card, part of a short-lived experimental program to package comics for resale at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and other mass-market retailers.

The original trade paperback from 1997 collects the entire series along with twelve additional pages by Ross, including the epilogue. Promotional artwork and sketches of the major characters were also included. The trade was also printed as a hardback (without dustjacket) by Graphitti Designs. Alex Ross provided a new cover painting for a new trade paperback released in 2008 that features a deluxe foldout cover only on its first printing (subsequent printings will not include the foldout).

A separate deluxe slipcased two-volume hardback edition, also copublished by DC and Graphitti Designs, added a second volume (entitled &quot;Revelations&quot;) to the text, containing further sketches and developmental artwork from Ross, showing the development of the character designs and the storyline.

A 1998 special from &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine contains the original proposal for the series by Ross, providing notes on what was changed and why. Ross&#x27;s comments on &quot;The Kingdom&quot; are also included.

DC released an &quot;Absolute Kingdom Come&quot; hardcover edition in 2006. It collects the entire series in a significantly larger page format, along with interviews with Waid and Ross, character artwork, sketches, and a complete annotation for the series. It was released again in the second quarter of 2018.

The novelization was written by Elliot S. Maggin. It was published by Warner Aspect as a hardback, and (in limited numbers) a slip-cased, signed edition. It fleshes out characters such as Magog, the world leaders, and the Batman/Ib&#x27;n connection. The book contains four new color pages by Ross, as well as four black and white sketches of the major players.

* The production team of &quot;Justice League: Warworld&quot; planned to develop a film adaptation of the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; comic book mini-series, but the idea was discarded by James Gunn and Peter Safran after they were named CEOs of DC Studios.
* Brandon Routh reprised his role of Clark Kent / Superman from the 2006 film &quot;Superman Returns&quot; in the 2019–2020 Arrowverse crossover event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. This version of Superman takes inspiration from &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. He wears a similar suit and works at the Daily Planet, which was attacked, presumably by the Joker. His Earth was designated as Earth-96, a reference to the year the comic was released. Furthermore, Kevin Conroy portrayed a variation of Bruce Wayne from Earth-99 that also incorporated elements of the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; version, such as the character wearing an exo-suit.

===DC Extended Universe===
* In &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot;, Wonder Woman is seen wearing her &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; armor.
* Hiram Garcia expressed interest to make a &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; film adaptation as part of the DCEU franchise.

===DC Universe===
* The DC Universe incarnation of &quot;Superman&quot; will use the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; incarnation of the &quot;S&quot; emblem on his suit. This was revealed in a teaser image posted on Threads by writer/director James Gunn.

==Spin-offs==
===Audio play===

Hachette Audio released an audio dramatization of the story, adapted from the novelization, featuring the voice talent of Mike Mearian, Don Peoples, Garet Scott, John Cunningham, Kent Broadhurst, Jeff David, Chuck Cooper, Harry Goz, Barbara Rosenblat, Craig Zakarian, Mike Arkin, Bob Lydiard, Peter Newman, Birgit Darby, Mark Finley, Igot Goldin, Macintyre Dixon, and Chloe Patellis, along with the guest voices of Dennis O&#x27;Neil, Mark Waid, Mike Carlin, Dan Raspler, Charles Kochman, Peter Tomasi, Greg Ross, Janet Harvey, Elisabeth Vincentelli. The music for the audio version was composed by John Bauers.

===&quot;The Comicology Kingdom Come Companion&quot;===
In January 1999, Harbor Press published the first (special) issue of their comics magazine &quot;Comicology&quot;. The 272-page &quot;Comicology: Kingdom Come Companion&quot;, edited by Brian Lamken, focuses heavily on &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, featuring an A-Z of almost everything, with extensive illustrations by Ross and various other commentary on the miniseries. It was the subject of a swift cease-and-desist notice from DC, objecting that the volume &quot;constitute[d] an unauthorized derivative work that infringe[d] upon [DC&#x27;s] copyrights, violates [their] trademark rights, and misappropriates [their] good will&quot;. Lamken acquiesced to the recall, despite protesting that DC had prior knowledge of the project. It is likely that the similarities between the material contained in the &quot;Revelations&quot; volume (available only with the purchase of the considerably-more-expensive Graphitti/DC two-volume set) contributed to the recall of the &quot;Comicology&quot; volume. The recall made the &quot;Companion&quot; arguably the most difficult &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; item to find.

===Trading cards===

In 1996, Fleer/Skybox released a set of trading cards based on &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, entitled &quot;Kingdom Come eXtra&quot;. Alongside the 50 basic cards, featuring art by Ross and text by Waid, there are 15 &quot;sketchboard&quot; cards, three &quot;Kingdom Classics&quot; (featuring Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman in iconic poses), six &quot;Alex Ross Original&quot; cards, and some rarer autograph cards.

===Action figures===

DC Direct (the exclusive collectibles division of DC Comics) has produced three waves of action figures based on &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;″s artwork. The first wave of figures included Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Hawkman. The second wave included Batman, Red Robin, Captain Marvel and Kid Flash. The last wave included Magog, Flash, Armored Wonder Woman and Deadman. An exclusive figure of Red Arrow was released through &quot;ToyFare&quot; magazine. DC Direct also released several other characters through their Elseworlds toylines. These figures included the Spectre, Norman McCay, Jade, Nightstar, Aquaman and Blue Beetle. An updated version of Kingdom Come Superman was released in &quot;JSA series2&quot;, which was based on the covers that Alex Ross worked on.

An action figure of Superman based on &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;&#x27;s artwork was released as part of Wave 10 of Mattel&#x27;s DC Multiverse toyline.

==See also==
* &quot;Earth X&quot;, another alternate universe series written and illustrated by Alex Ross that has similar themes and artwork to &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;
* &quot;&quot;, a series of video games and comic books that have a story similar to &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; such as the Joker killing Lois Lane in Metropolis or Superman and Batman forming their own factions of superheroes and fighting each other.

<doc id="454752" wikidata="Q544113" url="?curid=454752" title="Glastonbury Abbey">
<text>Glastonbury Abbey was a monastery in Glastonbury, Somerset, England. Its ruins, a grade I listed building and scheduled ancient monument, are open as a visitor attraction.

The abbey was founded in the 8th century and enlarged in the 10th. It was destroyed by a major fire in 1184, but subsequently rebuilt and by the 14th century was one of the richest and most powerful monasteries in England. The abbey controlled large tracts of the surrounding land and was instrumental in major drainage projects on the Somerset Levels. The abbey was suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII of England. The last abbot, Richard Whiting (Whyting), was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor in 1539.

From at least the 12th century, the Glastonbury area has been associated with the legend of King Arthur, a connection promoted by medieval monks who asserted that Glastonbury was Avalon. Christian legends have claimed that the abbey was founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the 1st century.

==History==

Suggestions that Glastonbury may have been a site of religious importance in Celtic or pre-Celtic times are considered dubious by the historian Ronald Hutton, but archaeological investigations by the University of Reading have demonstrated Roman and Saxon occupation of the site. In 1955 Ralegh Radford&#x27;s excavations uncovered Romano-British pottery at the west end of the cloister. The abbey was founded by Britons and dates at least to the early-7th century. Dark Age occupation of the site is evidenced by pieces of ceramic wine jars that were imported from the Mediterranean. A medieval Christian legend claimed that the abbey was founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the 1st century. This legend is intimately tied to Robert de Boron&#x27;s version of the Holy Grail story and Glastonbury&#x27;s connection with King Arthur from the early-12th century. William of Malmesbury reports the terms of a grant of land made by King Gwrgan of Damnonia to the &quot;old church&quot; at Glastonbury in AD 601 in the time of Abbot Worgret. 

Glastonbury fell into Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. Saxons under Cenwalh of Wessex conquered Somerset as far west as the River Parrett, perhaps with the intention of gaining control of the abbey. Cenwalh allowed the British abbot, Bregored, to remain in power, a move perhaps intended as a show of good faith to the defeated Britons. After Bregored&#x27;s death in 669, he was replaced by an Anglo-Saxon, Berhtwald, but British monks remained for many years.

===Saxon era===
King Ine of Wessex enriched the endowment of the community of monks established at Glastonbury and reputed to have directed that a stone church be built in 712, the foundations of which form the west end of the nave. A glassworks was established at the site during the 7th century. Glastonbury was affected by unrest due to the Danish incursions into the area in the 9th century and it may itself have been attacked during the wars (though this is not certain). The contemporary reformed soldier Saint Neot was sacristan at Glastonbury before he founded his own establishment in Somerset. The abbey church was enlarged in the 10th century by the abbot of Glastonbury, Dunstan, the central figure in the 10th-century revival of English monastic life, who instituted the Benedictine Rule at Glastonbury. He also built the cloisters. Dunstan became Archbishop of Canterbury in 960. In 946, King Edmund was interred at Glastonbury. In 1016 King Edmund Ironside was also buried there. King Cnut&#x27;s charter of 1032 was &quot;written and promulgated in the wooden church at Glastonbury, in the king&#x27;s presence&quot;.

The medieval Glastonbury Canal was built about the middle of the 10th century to link the abbey with the River Brue, a distance of about . Its purpose is believed to have been to transport stone to build the abbey, but later it was used to transport produce, including grain, wine and fish, from the abbey&#x27;s outlying properties. Much of the building stone came from the abbey&#x27;s quarries at Doulting, accessed by way of the River Sheppey at Pilton. From the 11th century, the abbey was the centre of a large water-borne transport network as further canalisations and new channels were made, including the diversion of the Brue to access to the estate at Meare and an easier route to the Bristol Channel. In the 13th century, the abbey&#x27;s head boatman transported the abbot in an eight-oared boat on visits to the abbey&#x27;s nearby manors.
During the Middle Ages, bone fragments of Saint Caesarius of Terracina were translated to Glastonbury Abbey.

===Medieval era===
====Norman conquest====
At the Norman Conquest in 1066, the wealth of Glastonbury made it a prime prize. William the Conqueror made Turstinus a Norman abbot there in 1086. Turstinus added to the church, unusually building to the east of the older Saxon church and away from the ancient cemetery, thus shifting the sanctified site. This was later changed by Herlewin, the next abbot, who built a larger church. Not all the new Normans were suitable heads of religious communities. In 1086, when the Domesday Book was commissioned, Glastonbury Abbey was the richest monastery in the country. About 1125, the abbot Henry of Blois commissioned a history of Glastonbury from the historian William of Malmesbury, who was a guest of the monks. His work &quot;On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church&quot; was compiled sometime between 1129 and 1139 as part of a campaign to establish the abbey&#x27;s primacy against Westminster. It is the source for much of our knowledge of the abbey&#x27;s early history but is far below William&#x27;s generally excellent standards: his acceptance of the monks&#x27; forged charters and unsubstantiated early legends is apparent and even his list of the community&#x27;s abbots cannot be reconciled with 10th-century originals subsequently discovered. These problems and the discrepancies between &quot;On the Antiquity&quot; and his own later histories has led many scholars to assume that William&#x27;s original text was more careful and its accounts of &quot;Phagan&quot; and &quot;Deruvian&quot;, along with various passages about Arthur, were later additions meant to bolster the monks&#x27; case.

Early drainage work on the Somerset Levels was carried out in the later years of the 12th century, with the responsibility for maintaining all the watercourses between Glastonbury and the sea being placed on named individuals among whom were Ralph de Sancta Barbara of Brentmarsh. In 1129, the abbot of Glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at Lympsham. Efforts to control flooding on the Parrett were recorded around the same date. In 1234, were reclaimed near Westonzoyland and, from the accounts in the abbey&#x27;s rent books, this had increased to by 1240. In the 14th century a Fish House was built at Meare for the chief fisherman of the abbot of Glastonbury that was also used for salting and preparing fish. It is the only surviving monastic fishery building in England. At the time of the Dissolution in 1540, Meare Pool was said to contain a great abundance of pike, tench, roach and eels. In 1638, it was owned by William Freake, who described it as &quot;lately a fish pool&quot;. The importance of this industry is illustrated by a series of acrimonious disputes between Glastonbury and the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral. The abbey required fish on Fridays, fast days and during Lent. As many as 5000 eels were landed in a typical year.

====King Arthur&#x27;s tomb====

In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury destroyed the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, which includes the well, was consecrated in 1186. There is evidence that, in the 12th century, the ruined nave was renovated enough for services while the great new church was being constructed. Parts of the walls of the aisle and crossing having been completed by 1189, progress then continued more slowly.

Pilgrim visits had fallen and in 1191 the alleged discovery of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere&#x27;s tomb in the cemetery provided fresh impetus for visiting Glastonbury. A contemporaneous, though not an eyewitness, account was given by Giraldus Cambrensis in his &quot;De principis instructione&quot; (&quot;Instruction of a Prince&quot;, c. 1193) and recollected in his &quot;Speculum Ecclesiae&quot;, c. 1216 according to which the abbot, Henry de Sully, commissioned a search, discovering at the depth of a massive hollowed oak trunk containing two skeletons. Above it, under the covering stone, according to Giraldus, was a lead cross with the unmistakably specific inscription &quot;&quot; (&quot;Here lies interred the famous King Arthur on the Isle of Avalon&quot;).

According to Giraldus, the digging for the tomb was prompted by the intelligence obtained by Henry II from an &quot;aged British (Welsh) bard&quot; (). On the other hand, Ralph of Coggeshall writing somewhat later, states more prosaically that they came upon the older tomb by chance while removing the earth to bury a certain monk who had expressed strong desire to be buried there. Both Giraldus and Ralph say that the spot lay in between two pyramids in the abbey. William of Malmesbury does not refer to Arthur&#x27;s tomb but elaborates on the pyramids of varying height, upon which were statues with inscriptions &quot;Her Sexi, and Bliserh ... Pencrest, Bantomp, Pinepegn, etc.&quot;

Historians today generally dismiss the authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184. William of Malmesbury&#x27;s history of the English kings stated &quot;Arthur&#x27;s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return&quot; and his work &quot;On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church&quot;—larded as it is with known and suspected pious forgeries—nowhere mentions a connection between the abbey and either Arthur&#x27;s grave or Avalon. The fact that the search for Arthur&#x27;s body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well. Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King Arthur&#x27;s messianic return: &quot;Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [i.e. Welsh, Cornish and Bretons] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, I have taken the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject.&quot;

====Annexation to Bath and Wells====
In 1197, Savaric FitzGeldewin, Bishop of Bath and Wells, traded the city of Bath to the king in return for the monastery of Glastonbury. Savaric secured the support of Pope Celestine III for the takeover the abbey as the seat of his bishopric, replacing Bath. The plan was that Savaric would be bishop of Bath as well as abbot of Glastonbury. In his support, Savaric obtained letters from various ecclesiastics, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter, that claimed that this arrangement would settle longstanding disputes between the abbey and the bishops. The monks of Glastonbury objected to Savaric&#x27;s plan, and sent an appeal to Rome, which was dismissed in 1196. But King Richard, no longer imprisoned in Germany, sided with the monks, and allowed them to elect an abbot, William Pica, in place of Savaric, who responded by excommunicating the new abbot. With the succession of John as king in place of his brother Richard in 1199, Savaric managed to force his way into the monastery and set up his episcopal see within the abbey. The monks appealed to Innocent III, the new pope.

At first, Innocent took the side of the monks, and lifted Pica&#x27;s excommunication. While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica and a number of his supporters, who had travelled to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.

The bishops continued to use the title &quot;Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury&quot; until finally renouncing their claim to Glastonbury in 1219. Services in the reconsecrated Great Church had begun on Christmas Day, 1213, most likely before it was entirely completed. King Edward I and Queen Eleanor attended the magnificent service at the reburial of King Arthur&#x27;s remains to the foot of the High Altar in 1278.

====14th and 15th centuries====
In the 14th century, only Westminster Abbey was more richly endowed and appointed than Glastonbury. The abbot of Glastonbury kept great estate, now attested to simply by the ruins of the Abbot&#x27;s Kitchen, with four huge fireplaces at its corners. The kitchen was part of the magnificent abbot&#x27;s house begun under Abbot John de Breynton (1334–42). It is one of the best preserved medieval kitchens in Europe, and the only substantial monastic building surviving at Glastonbury. Archaeological excavations have revealed a special apartment erected at the south end of the abbot&#x27;s house for a visit from Henry VII, who visited the abbot in a royal progress, as he visited any other great territorial magnate. The conditions of life in England during the Wars of the Roses became so unsettled that a wall was built around the abbey&#x27;s precincts.

The George Hotel and Pilgrims&#x27; Inn was built in the late 15th century to accommodate visitors to the abbey. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The abbey also held lands outside the town serving large parts of Somerset and including parts of neighbouring counties. Tithe barns were built to hold the crops due to the abbey including those at Doulting, Mells and Pilton.

===Dissolution of the Monasteries===
At the start of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, there were over 850 monasteries, nunneries and friaries in England. By 1541, there were none. More than 15,000 monks and nuns had been dispersed and the buildings had been seized by the Crown to be sold off or leased to new lay occupants. Glastonbury Abbey was reviewed as having significant amounts of silver and gold as well as its attached lands. In September 1539, the abbey was visited by Richard Layton, Richard Pollard and Thomas Moyle, who arrived there without warning on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. The abbey was stripped of its valuables and Abbot Richard Whiting (Whyting), who had been a signatory to the Act of Supremacy that made Henry VIII the head of the church, resisted and was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor on 15 November 1539.

===Decline===
After the Dissolution, two of the abbey&#x27;s manors in Wiltshire were sold by the Crown to John Thynne and thereafter descended in his family, who much later became Marquesses of Bath. The Thynnes have preserved many of the abbey&#x27;s Wiltshire records at Longleat up to the present day. The ruins of the abbey itself was stripped of lead and dressed stones hauled away to be used in other buildings. The site was granted by Edward VI to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset who established a colony of Protestant Dutch weavers on the site. When Seymour was attainted in 1551, the abbey site reverted to the crown, but the weavers remained until they were removed in the reign of Queen Mary. In 1559 Elizabeth I of England granted the site to Peter Carew, and it remained in private ownership until the beginning of the 20th century. Further stones were removed in the 17th century, so that by the beginning of the 18th century the abbey was described as a ruin. The only building to survive intact is the Abbot&#x27;s Kitchen, which served as a Quaker meeting house. Early in the 19th century, gunpowder was used to dislodge further stones and the site became a quarry. The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 stopped further damage to the site and led to the first historical and archaeological surveys.

===Modern history===
The ruins of Glastonbury Abbey were purchased by the Bath and Wells Diocesan Trust in 1908. The ruins are now the property of and managed by the Glastonbury Abbey trust. On acquiring the site the trust appointed Frederick Bligh Bond to direct an archaeological investigation. Bond discovered the Edgar Chapel, North Porch and St Dunstan&#x27;s Chapel, however relations with his employers turned sour when he revealed in his 1919 book, &quot;The Gates of Remembrance&quot;, that he had made many of his interpretations in collaboration with a psychic medium. He was dismissed by Bishop Armitage Robinson in 1921, because of his use of seances and psychic archaeology but is remembered as the man who &quot;galvanised our cultural understanding of Glastonbury&quot;.

A pilgrimage to the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey was held by a few local churches in 1924. Pilgrimages continue today to be held; in the second half of June for the Anglicans and early in July for the Catholics and they attract visitors from all over Western Europe. Services are celebrated in the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. The abbey site is visited by over 100,000 a year.

===Architecture===
The ruins of the great church, along with the Lady Chapel, are grade I listed buildings, and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is set in of parkland and open to the public. It is approached by the abbey gatehouse, which was built in the mid 14th century and completely restored in 1810. The 14th century abbey barn is also open to the public, outside the walls, as part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum.

The great church was in length and wide. The choir was long and the transept was long. St Joseph&#x27;s chapel was long and wide. The remaining portions are of the clerestory and triforium arcades, which were the supports of the central square tower. Other fragments of structures which remain include portions of the outer walls of the chancel aisles and the 14th century retroquire. There is also surviving stonework from the south nave aisle wall, west front and the Galilee along with its crypt linked to St Mary&#x27;s Chapel. The Lady Chapel, from which the walls survive, was described in 1478 as being in length and wide.

The Abbot&#x27;s Kitchen is described as &quot;one of the best preserved medieval kitchens in Europe&quot;. The 14th century octagonal building is supported by curved buttresses on each side leading up to a cornice with grotesque gargoyles. Inside are four large arched fireplaces with smoke outlets above them, with another outlet in the centre of the pyramidal roof. The kitchen was attached to the high abbot&#x27;s hall, although only one small section of its wall remains.

The analysis of the 20th-century archaeological investigations have recently been published along with the results of a new geophysical survey.

===Library===
The abbey library was described by John Leland, King Henry VIII&#x27;s antiquary who visited it, as containing unique copies of ancient histories of England and unique early Christian documents. It seems to have been affected by the fire of 1184, but still housed a remarkable collection until 1539 when it was dispersed at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Around 40 of the manuscripts from Glastonbury are known to have survived after the dissolution.

===Abbey House===
Within the abbey wall is Abbey House, which was used by the Diocese of Bath and Wells as a retreat house from 1931 until 2018. It is now occasionally open to the public for special events and provides additional administration space for the Abbey.

The Tudor Gothic house was built between 1829 and 1830 by John Buckler from the stones of the abbey ruins for John Fry Reeves. It was altered and extended between 1850 and 1860, with further alterations in 1957.

==Glastonbury Thorn==
A specimen of common hawthorn found at Glastonbury, first mentioned in an early 16th-century anonymous metrical &quot;Lyfe of Joseph of Arimathea,&quot; was unusual in that it flowered twice in a year, once as normal on &quot;old wood&quot; in spring, and once on &quot;new wood&quot; (the current season&#x27;s matured new growth) in the winter. This tree has been widely propagated by grafting or cuttings, with the cultivar name &#x27;Biflora&#x27; or &#x27;Praecox&#x27;. The custom of sending a budded branch of the Glastonbury thorn to the Queen at Christmas was initiated by James Montague, Bishop of Bath and Wells during James I&#x27;s reign, who sent a branch to Queen Anne, King James I&#x27;s consort. Trees survive from earlier grafts to perpetuate the Glastonbury legend, among them two other Holy Thorns in the grounds of St John&#x27;s Church in Glastonbury. The blossom sent to the Queen now comes from one of these.

The series received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including one for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series, and was renewed for a second season set to air in 2022. Caroline Framke of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the series writing, &quot;It’s exactly the picturesque scenario you might expect and want from a travel series hosted by Tucci, an extraordinarily charming presence who knows and loves Italian food&quot;.

Tucci acted in the title role in the BBC One thriller series &quot;Inside Man&quot; (2022). The series was created by Steven Moffat and also starred David Tennant. In September, Tucci was cast as Grammy-winning producer Clive Davis in &quot;Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody&quot; (2022), a biopic on Whitney Houston. In 2023, Tucci acted in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Citadel&quot; starring Priyanka Chopra and Richard Madden. In 2024, Tucci played a major role in the Edward Berger film &quot;Conclave&quot; alongside Ralph Fiennes, which premiered at the 51st Telluride Film Festival.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and family ===
Tucci married Kathryn Spath (born 1962, died 2009) in 1995. She was a social worker, former wife of actor and stage manager Alexander R. Scott, and former sister-in-law of Tucci&#x27;s high school friend Campbell Scott. They had three children together. The couple also raised Kathryn&#x27;s two children from her previous marriage.
Tucci had an affair in 2002 with actress Edie Falco, with whom he was appearing on Broadway in Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot;, but the affair ended, and he returned to his wife and children. Spath died of breast cancer in 2009, aged 47.

In 2010 Tucci met Felicity Blunt (born 1981), a British literary agent of the Curtis Brown Group, at the wedding of actor John Krasinski to Felicity&#x27;s sister, British actress Emily Blunt. Tucci and Felicity became engaged in 2011 and married in a civil ceremony in the summer of 2012, followed by a larger observance at Middle Temple Hall in London on September 29, 2012. They have a son and a daughter.

=== Charity work ===
On September 12, 2016, Tucci, alongside other celebrities, appeared in a video from the United Nations&#x27; refugee agency UNHCR to help raise awareness of the global refugee crisis. The video, titled &quot;What They Took With Them&quot;, has the actors reading a poem, written by Jenifer Toksvig and inspired by primary accounts of refugees, and is part of UNHCR&#x27;s #WithRefugees campaign, which also includes a petition to governments to expand asylum to provide further shelter, integrating job opportunities, and education.

On May 21, 2021, Tucci received a Doctorate &quot;Honoris Causa&quot; in Humane Letters from the American University of Rome, in Rome, Italy, for his lifelong contribution to the arts and humanities.

=== Health issues ===
In September 2021, Tucci revealed that he had been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer three years earlier. He had received treatment (chemotherapy and radiation) after a tumor was found at the base of his tongue, and said it was unlikely that the tumor would return. In November 2022, he said there are still some foods he cannot eat, as a result of his cancer.

In October 2021, his memoir &quot;Taste: My Life Through Food&quot; was published, which describes his encounter with cancer and his love of food. The memoir was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List for 16 weeks, until February 13, 2022.

<text>BGI Group, formerly Beijing Genomics Institute, is a Chinese genomics company with headquarters in Yantian, Shenzhen. The company was originally formed in 1999 as a genetics research center to participate in the Human Genome Project. It also sequences the genomes of other animals, plants and microorganisms.

BGI has transformed from a small research institute, notable for decoding the DNA of pandas and rice plants, into a diversified company active in animal cloning, health testing, and contract research. BGI&#x27;s earlier research was continued by the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. BGI Research, the group&#x27;s nonprofit division, works with the Institute of Genomics and operates the China National GeneBank under a contract with the Chinese government. BGI Genomics, a subsidiary, was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2017. The company is supported by several China Government Guidance Funds and Chinese state-owned enterprises.

Starting in 2021, details came to light about multiple controversies involving the BGI Group. These controversies include alleged collaboration with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) and use of genetic data from prenatal tests. BGI denied that it shares prenatal genetics data with the PLA.

==History==

=== Beijing Genomics Institute ===

Wang Jian, Yu Jun, Yang Huanming and Liu Siqi created BGI, originally named Beijing Genomics Institute, in September 1999, in Beijing, China as a non-governmental independent research institute in order to participate in the Human Genome Project as China&#x27;s representative. After the project was completed, funding dried up, after which BGI moved to Hangzhou in exchange for funding from the Hangzhou Municipal Government. In 2002, BGI sequenced the rice genome, which was a cover story in the journal Science. In 2003, BGI decoded the SARS virus genome and created a kit for detection of the virus. In 2003, the Chinese Academy of Sciences founded the Beijing Institute of Genomics in cooperation with BGI, with Yang Huanming as its first director. BGI Hangzhou and the Zhejiang University also founded a new research institute, the James D. Watson Institute of Genome Sciences, Zhejiang University.

=== Spin-off from the Beijing Genomics Institute ===
In 2007, BGI broke away from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, became a private company, and relocated to Shenzhen. Yu Jun left BGI at this time purportedly selling his stake to the other 3 founders for a nominal sum. In 2008, BGI published the first human genome of an Asian individual.

In 2010, BGI bought 128 &quot;Illumina HiSeq 2000&quot; gene-sequencing machines, which was backed by US$1.5 billion in &quot;collaborative funds&quot; over the next 10 years from the state lender China Development Bank. By the end of the year, they reportedly had a budget of $30 million. In 2010, BGI Americas was established with its main office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, and BGI Europe was established in Copenhagen, Denmark. By 2018, BGI opened offices and laboratories in Seattle and San Jose in US, and London in the UK, as well were founded BGI Asia Pacific with offices in Hong Kong, Kobe (Japan), Bangkok (Thailand), Laos, Singapore, Brisbane (Australia) and many others.

In 2011, BGI reported it employed 4,000 scientists and technicians, and had a $192 million in revenue. BGI did the genome sequencing for the deadly 2011 Germany E. coli O104:H4 outbreak in three days and released it under an open license. Since 2012, it has started to commercialize its services, having investments from China Life Insurance Company, CITIC Group&#x27;s Goldstone Investment, Jack Ma&#x27;s Yunfeng Capital, and SoftBank China Capital. That year they also launched their own scientific journal, &quot;GigaScience&quot;, partnering with BioMed Central to publish data-heavy life science papers. A new partnership was subsequently formed between the GigaScience Press department of BGI and Oxford University Press and since 2017 GigaScience has been co-published with the Oxford University Press.

In 2013, BGI bought Complete Genomics of Mountain View, California, a major supplier of DNA sequencing technology, for US$118 million, after gaining approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Complete Genomics is a US-based subsidiary of MGI, MGI was a subsidiary of BGI before it was spun out and listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2022.

In 2015, BGI signed a collaboration with the Zhongshan Hospital&#x27; Center for Clinical Precision Medicine in Shanghai, opened in May 2015 with a budget of ¥100 million. They are reportedly being involved as a sequencing institution in China&#x27;s US$9.2-billion research project for medical care which will last for 15 years. In May 2017, was announced formation of West Coast Innovation Center, co-located in Seattle and San Jose, on the first location planned to work on precision medicine and feature collaborations with University of Washington, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and Washington State University, while on the second&#x27;s already existing laboratory with 100 employees to develop the next-generation sequencing technologies. In May 2018, reached an agreement with Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto), Canada, for first installation of BGISEQ platforms in North America.

BGI Genomics, a subsidiary of the group made an initial public offering in July 2017 at Shenzhen Stock Exchange. In 2018, the BGI was reportedly 85.3% owned by Wang Jian, and the group owns 42.4% of its main unit BGI Genomics.

In 2019, it was reported that a BGI subsidiary, Forensic Genomics International, had created a WeChat-enabled database of genetic profiles of people across the country. In July 2020, it was reported that BGI returned a Paycheck Protection Program loan following media scrutiny.

In 2021, state-owned enterprises of State Development and Investment Corporation and China Merchants Group took ownership stakes in BGI Genomics.

=== U.S. sanctions ===

In July 2020, the United States Department of Commerce&#x27;s Bureau of Industry and Security placed two BGI subsidiaries on its Entity List for assisting in alleged human rights abuses due to its genetic analysis work in Xinjiang. In March 2023, the United States Department of Commerce added BGI Research and BGI Tech Solutions (Hongkong) to the Entity List over allegations of surveillance and repression of ethnic minorities.

BGI subsequently hired lobbyists at Steptoe &amp; Johnson to soften language in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 that would prohibit government funding of BGI and its subsidiaries.

As of 2024, BGI is identified in a list by the United States Department of Defense as a Chinese military company operating in the U.S. In April 2024, the United States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party asked the Department of Defense for an explanation for why BGI subsidiaries Innomics and STOmics were not included in the same list.

== Research ==

=== E. coli ===
In 2011, BGI sequenced the genome of E. coli bacteria causing an epidemic in Europe to identify genes that lead to resistance to antibiotics.

=== COVID-19 ===
In January 2020, BGI Genomics announced its real-time fluorescent RT-PCR kit that helps in identification of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. This was subsequently verified and authorized for use in 14 countries and regions, including emergency use listing by the World Health Organization. BGI Genomics reported that by April 2021 the RT-PCR kits had been distributed to more than 180 countries and regions. BGI also developed biosafety level 2 high-throughput nucleic acid detection laboratories, named Huo-Yan laboratories.

In the first half of 2020, BGI Group offered to help the state of California set up COVID-19 testing labs at cost. The government of California rejected the offer due to geopolitical concerns, but Santa Clara County did buy COVID-19 test kits and equipment from BGI.

On August 25, 2020, Reuters reported that about 3,700 people in Sweden were told in error that they had the coronavirus due to a fault in a COVID-19 testing kit from BGI Genomics. Despite being the 5th test to be given WHO Emergency Use Listing, and getting top marks in sensitivity tests in a Dutch study independently validating commercially available tests. BGI Genomics defended the product, blaming differences in thresholds used between labs looking at very low levels of the virus.

=== Bioinformatics technology ===

The annual budget for the computer center was US$9 million. In the same year, BGI&#x27;s computational biologists developed the first successful algorithm, based on graph theory, for aligning billions of 25 to 75-base pair strings produced by next-generation sequencers, specifically Illumina&#x27;s Genome Analyzer, during de novo sequencing.

SOAPdenovo is part of &quot;Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package&quot; (SOAP), a suite of tools developed by BGI for &quot;de novo&quot; assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis. Built for the Illumina sequencers&#x27; short reads, SOAPdenovo has been used to assemble multiple human genomes (identifying an eight kilobase insertion not detected by mapping to the human reference genome) and animals, like the giant panda.

Up until 2015, BGI had released BGISEQ-100, based on Thermo Fisher Scientific&#x27;s Ion Torrent device, and BGISEQ-1000, for both of which received an approval from the CFDA for a NIFTY (Non-invasive Fetal Trisomy Test) prenatal test. In October 2015, BGI launched BGISEQ-500, a larger desktop sequencing system. It reportedly received more than 500 orders for the system and run over 112,000 tests until late 2016. The China National GeneBank, opened by BGI and Chinese Government in September 2016, has 150 instruments of the system. The BGISEQ-500 was developed as a sequencing platform capable of competing with Illumina&#x27;s platforms. In November 2016, BGI launched BGISEQ-50, a miniature version of desktop sequencer. In 2017, BGI began offering WGS for $600. In September 2022, MGI launched DNBSeq-G99, a new ultra-high-speed, mid-to-low throughput sequencer.

In 2021, BGI developed Stereo-seq, its genome wide Spatial transcriptomics technology and released the first research findings from a consortium of scientific users of the technology in 2022. In 2022, BGI-Research and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences together with scientists globally, used sequencing technologies to undertake single cell sequencing to expand the understanding of early human embryonic development, to complete the first whole-body cell atlas of a non-human primate, to complete the world&#x27;s first body-wide single cell transcriptome atlas of pigs, and to study the brains of ants to explain for the first time how the social division of labor within ant colonies is determined by functional specialization of their brains at cellular levels.

=== Agriculture and biodiversity ===

In 2002, BGI published the genome of the indica variety of rice. In 2014, BGI also collaborated on a project to re-sequence 3,000 rice genomes from 89 countries.

BGI is a member of the international Earth BioGenome Project which aims to sequence the DNA of all known eukaryotic species on Earth. BGI has contributed to the 10KP Genome Sequencing Project, an affiliated project to sequence over 10,000 plant genomes.

=== Animal Kingdom ===

In 2004, BGI was a Member of the International Chicken Genome Consortium that published the genome of the chicken. In 2009, BGI published the genome of the Giant Panda.

In 2014, BGI and scientists from 20 countries worked together to complete the genome-wide sequencing of 48 bird species. In 2020, BGI contributed to the completion of whole genome sequencing of 363 genomes from 92.4% of bird families.

In 2022, BGI led research that published the world&#x27;s first spatiotemporal map of axolotl brain regeneration. During the same year, a study carried out by BGI, Northeast Forestry University, and other institutions revealed the genomics consequences of inbreeding in the South China tiger by examining its chromosome-scale genomes and comparing it with the Amur tiger.

In 2023, BGI and a scientific consortium jointly published a primate brain cell atlas.

== Legal disputes ==
In 2019, competitor Illumina, Inc. filed multiple patent infringement lawsuits against BGI. In response, BGI has filed patent infringement lawsuits against Illumina alleging violations of federal antitrust and California unfair competition laws. In May 2022 a US court ordered Illumina to pay US$333.8 million to BGI Group after finding that Illumina&#x27;s DNA-sequencing systems infringed two of BGI&#x27;s patents. The ruling also stated Illumina infringed the patents wilfully, and that three patents it had accused BGI&#x27;s Complete Genomics subsidiary of infringing were invalid. In July 2022 Illumina and MGI Tech Co. and Complete Genomics, settled US suits on DNA-sequencing technology, with Illumina agreeing to pay $325 million to settle all US litigation. As part of the settlement Illumina will receive a license to the BGI affiliates&#x27; patents, and both companies agreed to not sue each other for patent or antitrust violations in the United States for three years.

== Collaboration with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army ==

In January 2021, Reuters reported that BGI has worked with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) and affiliated institutions such as the National University of Defense Technology on efforts to enhance soldiers&#x27; strength and other projects. In July 2021, Reuters reported that BGI developed a prenatal test, with the assistance of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which is also used for genetic data collection. In an interview with the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, a BGI representative denied the Reuters report. The &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; stated that BGI published papers with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army General Hospital and the Army Medical University, explaining in the article that in China &quot;many top-notch hospitals are affiliated with the military.&quot; BGI further stated &quot;All NIPT data collected overseas are stored in BGI&#x27;s laboratory in Hong Kong and are destroyed after five years, as stipulated by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&quot;. BGI also stated &quot;BGI has never been asked to provide, nor has it provided data from its NIFTY tests to Chinese authorities for national security or national defense security purposes.&quot;

In response to the Reuters report, a German privacy regulator launched a probe of a German company&#x27;s use of BGI&#x27;s prenatal genetic tests. In August 2021, the UK announced a registration requirement with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for BGI&#x27;s prenatal tests. Regulators in Australia, Estonia, Canada, and Poland also raised concerns as did the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center.

In November 2021, Reuters reported that a University of Copenhagen professor, Guojie Zhang, who was also employed by BGI was developing drugs for the PLA to assist soldiers with managing altitude sickness. BGI stated that the study &quot;was not carried out for military purposes.&quot; On December 1, 2021, the University of Copenhagen commented on the Reuters report.

In October 2022, the United States Department of Defense added BGI Genomics Co, a listed subsidiary, to a list of &quot;Chinese military companies&quot; operating in the U.S.

<text>A razee or razée is a sailing ship that has been cut down (&quot;razeed&quot;) to reduce the number of decks. The word is derived from the French &quot;vaisseau rasé&quot;, meaning a razed (in the sense of shaved down) ship.

==Seventeenth century==
During the transition from galleons to more frigate-like warships (1600 – 1650) there was a general awareness that the reduction in topweight afforded by the removal of upperworks made ships better sailers; Rear Admiral Sir William Symonds noted after the launch of &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; that she was &quot;cut down&quot; and made a safe and fast ship. In 1651 &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; was again made more manoeuvrable by reducing the number of cannon. Ships were razeed not only by navies but also by pirates – Charles Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates&quot; describes George Lowther refitting &quot;Gambia Castle&quot; in 1721:

This did not reduce the number of gun decks, but had the effect of making the razee ship much handier, since the forecastle and aftcastle no longer created windage, top weight was reduced, and the ship was made lighter overall.

==Eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries==

===Royal Navy===

In the Royal Navy, the razee operation was typically performed on a smaller two-deck ship of the line, resulting in a large frigate. The rationale for this apparent reduction in gun power was that the smaller ships-of-the-line could no longer be used safely in fleet actions as the overall size and armament of opposing ships increased. The resulting razeed ship was classed as a frigate; it was stronger than the usual run of purpose-built frigates.

In similar fashion, three-decked ships of the line were sometimes razeed, either to become flush-decked (with the quarterdeck and forecastle removed) or cut down to become two-deckers.

 was a 90-gun second rate launched in 1756. She was razeed as a 74-gun third rate in 1805.

Three 64-gun ships were cut down (razeed) in 1794 into 44-gun frigates. The most successful was HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot; which was commanded by Sir Edward Pellew. 
* HMS &quot;Magnanime&quot; of 1780
* HMS &quot;Anson&quot; of 1781
* HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot; of 1784

Towards the close of the Napoleonic Wars, three elderly 74-gun ships were razeed into 58-gun fourth rates (not losing a complete deck, so remaining a two-decker, but having the quarterdeck removed). Two more followed immediately post-war, although the second never completed conversion.
* HMS &quot;Goliath&quot; of 1781 (razeed 1813)
* HMS &quot;Majestic&quot; of 1785 (razeed 1813) 
* HMS &quot;Saturn&quot; of 1786 (razeed 1813)
* HMS &quot;Elephant&quot; of 1786 (razeed 1817-18)
* HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; of 1787 (began razee 1825)

Another eleven more-recent 74s were razeed in 1826-1845, in this case being fully reduced to 50-gun heavy frigates; three others were scheduled for similar conversion, but this was never completed.
* HMS &quot;Barham&quot; of 1811 (razeed 1826)
* HMS &quot;Dublin&quot; of 1812 (razeed 1826)
* HMS &quot;Asia&quot; of 1811 (renamed HMS &quot;Alfred&quot; 1819 and razeed 1826-28)

==Late nineteenth century==

In the United States Navy, several of the final generation of sailing frigates launched in the 1840s were cut down to become large sloops-of-war. Advances in metallurgy and artillery in the 1850s allowed the casting of guns that fired substantially heavier shot than had previously been in use, as well as exploding shells. Thus, when the decision was made to rearm these frigates with heavier but fewer guns, the reduction in crew size allowed the ships to be razeed. Their sail plan and size made them superb sailers. Although these ships carried a heavier broadside as 20 gun sloops-of-war than they did as 40 gun frigates, they were rerated as nominally smaller sloops-of-war because they mounted fewer guns. Such ships include USS &quot;Macedonian&quot; and USS &quot;Cumberland&quot;.

<text>Dave Grossman is an American game programmer and game designer, most known for his work at Telltale Games and early work at LucasArts. He has also written several children&#x27;s books, and a book of &quot;guy poetry&quot; called &quot;Ode to the Stuff in the Sink&quot;.

In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

==Game industry career==
Grossman joined Lucasfilm Games, later known as LucasArts in 1989. At LucasArts, Grossman wrote and programmed &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; together with Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer. He later co-designed &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;.

Grossman quit LucasArts in 1994 to begin a freelance career. For Humongous Entertainment, a company co-founded by Ron Gilbert, he helped create many critically acclaimed games aimed at children, such as the &quot;Pajama Sam&quot; series. Later he also wrote children&#x27;s games for Hulabee Entertainment and Disney.

He then designed adventure games at Telltale Games, a company founded by LucasArts veterans. He joined Telltale in 2005 as lead designer. In 2009, he returned to his &quot;Monkey Island&quot; roots, as Design Director on Telltale Games&#x27; episodic &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;.

He left Telltale in August 2014 and joined Amazon Alexa gaming specialists, Reactive Studios, in November 2014 as Chief Creative Officer. Reactive Studios has since changed its name to EarPlay.

In 2020 he joined Ron Gilbert in developing &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;. The game was released in 2022.

==Children&#x27;s books==
Lyrick Publishing published three books written by Grossman that were based on characters from Humongous Entertainment&#x27;s games. They were &quot;Freddi Fish: The Big Froople Match&quot;, &quot;Pajama Sam: Mission to the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Freddi Fish: The Missing Letters Mystery&quot;.

For Fisher-Price/Nickelodeon, Grossman authored two interactive books, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: Sleepy Time&quot; and &quot;Fairly OddParents: Squawkers&quot;.

==Other works==
Grossman claimed that his interests in other works were often inspired by his father: &quot;I guess I&#x27;ve inherited a certain restless tinkerer&#x27;s curiosity from my father (who mainly works in words, wood, photography and architecture, often in combination).&quot; These include his interests in writing, drawing, sculpture, and music.

Grossman is the author of &quot;Ode to the Stuff in the Sink: A Book of Guy Poetry,&quot; which he self-published in 2002. It contains a selection of illustrated poems dedicated to different aspects of male life, including inability to dance, old stuff in the fridge, and unwillingness to clean anything. The book is available from Dave Grossman&#x27;s personal website, Phrenopolis.com. Many of the poems were first published in his Poem of the Week electronic mailing list.

Grossman co-designed a successful robot toy for Fisher-Price.

==Game contributions==

Grossman also made contributions to &quot;The Dig&quot;, &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;, and &quot;Insecticide&quot;, and was a script editor on &quot;Voodoo Vince&quot;. He also designed the trophies / Steam achievements for the remastered version of &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;.

<text>Twitch City is a Canadian sitcom produced by CBC Television, which aired as two short runs in 1998 and 2000. The series also aired in the United States on Bravo, and in Australia. The show&#x27;s surreal humour was popular with critics. The show was never a mainstream ratings success in Canada, although it had a devoted cult following.

The show was directed by Bruce McDonald and produced by Shadow Shows and Accent Entertainment in association with the CBC. Music was composed by Bob Wiseman.

==Plot==
Set in the Toronto, Ontario neighbourhood of Kensington Market, the series is about Curtis (Don McKellar), a television addict who refuses to leave his apartment, and his friends Nathan (Daniel MacIvor), Hope (Molly Parker) and Newbie (Callum Keith Rennie). McKellar was also one of the show&#x27;s creators.

In the first episode, Nathan is sent to prison for killing a homeless man with a can of cat food. The homeless man was played by Al Waxman, who had been the star of the 1970s sitcom &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, although the producers claimed that they did not intend for the homeless man to be seen as the same character. Nathan remained in prison throughout the run of the series; the first episode of the second season opened with an &quot;Oz&quot; parody in which he criticized the hip hop-inspired slam poetry of his cellmate.

Throughout the series, Curtis and Hope&#x27;s ongoing attempts to find a new roommate to replace Nathan provide one of the show&#x27;s major plot threads. In one episode, Curtis rents Nathan&#x27;s room to a mysterious businessman who uses it to store drugged cookies, while in another, Hope unwittingly rents it to two Neo-Nazis she mistakes for a gay couple. That episode includes a Nazi rally which features all four members of the rock band Sloan among the extras. At the end of the episode, the two Nazi roommates renounce Nazism and promptly kiss each other, vindicating Hope&#x27;s judgement.

Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney (both from &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;) also starred in the series as Rex Reilly, the Jerry Springer-like host of Curtis&#x27; favourite TV talk show. McCulloch played Reilly in the first season, and McKinney played him in the second. The change in Reilly&#x27;s appearance is explained in his autobiography, &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;, which refers to his &quot;on-air cranium transplant.&quot;

Guest stars on the series included Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tom McCamus, Valerie Buhagiar, Charmion King, Kenneth Welsh, Hugh Dillon, Kim Mitchell, Stefan Brogren, John L&#x27;Ecuyer and Joyce DeWitt. DeWitt plays herself as a guest on &quot;The Rex Reilly Show&quot;, meeting lookalikes in an episode devoted to the theme &quot;I Look Like Joyce DeWitt&quot;.

==DVD release==

All thirteen episodes were released on DVD in 2006.

==Episodes==
Most episodes of the series are titled for the theme of the &quot;Rex Reilly Show&quot; episode depicted in the script.

<text>Accounts payable (AP) is money owed by a business to its suppliers shown as a liability on a company&#x27;s balance sheet. It is distinct from notes payable liabilities, which are debts created by formal legal instrument documents. An accounts payable department&#x27;s main responsibility is to process and review transactions between the company and its suppliers and to make sure that all outstanding invoices from their suppliers are approved, processed, and paid. The accounts payable process starts with collecting supply requirements from within the organization and seeking quotes from vendors for the items required. Once the deal is negotiated, purchase orders are prepared and sent. The goods delivered are inspected upon arrival and the invoice received is routed for approvals. Processing an invoice includes recording important data from the invoice and inputting it into the company&#x27;s financial, or bookkeeping, system. After this is accomplished, the invoices must go through the company&#x27;s respective business process in order to be paid.

==Overview==
An accounts payable department is typically located within an organisation&#x27;s finance function.

An account payable is recorded in the Account Payable sub-ledger at the time an invoice is vouched for payment. Vouchered, or vouched, means that an invoice is approved for payment and has been recorded in the General Ledger or AP subledger as an outstanding, or open, liability because it has not been paid. Payables are often categorized as Trade Payables, payables for the purchase of physical goods that are recorded in Inventory, and Expense Payables, payables for the purchase of goods or services that are expensed. Common examples of Expense Payables are advertising, travel, entertainment, office supplies and utilities. &quot;AP&quot; is a form of credit that suppliers offer to their customers by allowing them to pay for a product or service after it has already been received. Suppliers offer various payment terms for an invoice. Payment terms may include the offer of a cash discount for paying an invoice within a defined number of days. For example, 2%, Net 30 terms mean that the payer will deduct 2% from the invoice if payment is made within 30 days. If the payment is made on Day 31 then the full amount is paid. 

In a business, there is usually a much broader range of services in the AP file, and accountants or bookkeepers usually use accounting software to track the flow of money into this liability account when they receive invoices and out of it when they make payments. Increasingly, large firms are using specialized Accounts Payable automation solutions (commonly called ePayables) to automate the paper and manual elements of processing an organization&#x27;s invoices.

Commonly, a supplier will ship a product, issue an invoice, and collect payment later. This is a cash conversion cycle, or a period of time during which the supplier has already paid for raw materials but has not been paid in return by the final customer.

When the invoice is received by the purchaser, it is matched to the packing slip and purchase order, and if all is in order, the invoice is paid. This is referred to as the three-way match. The three-way match can slow down the payment process, so the method may be modified. For example, three-way matching may be limited solely to large-value invoices, or the matching is automatically approved if the received quantity is within a certain percentage of the amount authorized in the purchase order. Invoice processing automation software handles the matching process differently depending upon the business rules put in place during the creation of the workflow process. The simplest case is the two way matching between the invoice itself and the purchase order.

Estimates from 2009 suggested that more than a billion business-to-business invoices were being processed each week, and 97% of these were still processed manually. The average cost to process and pay a supplier invoice was between $5 and $15, with 10% processed too late to be paid within discounting terms, and nearly 2% containing errors.

In households, accounts payable are ordinarily bills from suppliers such as an electric company, telephone company, cable television or satellite dish service, newspaper subscription, and other such regular services. Householders can track and pay on a monthly basis by hand using cheques, credit cards or internet banking.

==Internal controls==
A variety of checks against abuse are usually present to prevent embezzlement by accounts payable personnel. Separation of duties is a common control. In countries where cheques payment are common nearly all companies have a junior employee process and print a cheque and a senior employee review and sign the cheque. Often, the accounting software will limit each employee to performing only the functions assigned to them, so that there is no way any one employee – even the controller – can singlehandedly make a payment.

Some companies also separate the functions of adding new vendors to the master vendor file and entering vouchers. This makes it impossible for an employee to add themselves as a vendor and then write a cheque to themselves without colluding with another employee. The master vendor file is the repository of all significant information about the company&#x27;s suppliers. It is the reference point for accounts payable when it comes to paying invoices.

In addition, most companies require a second signature on cheques whose amount exceeds a specified threshold.

Accounts payable personnel must watch for fraudulent invoices. In the absence of a purchase order system, the first line of defense is the approving manager. However, AP staff should become familiar with a few common problems, such as &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; ripoffs in which fraudulent operators offer to place an advertisement. The walking-fingers logo has never been trademarked, and there are many different Yellow Pages-style directories, most of which have a small distribution. According to an article in the Winter 2000 American Payroll Association&#x27;s &quot;Employer Practices&quot;, &quot;Vendors may send documents that look like invoices but in small print they state &quot;this is not a bill&quot;. These may be charges for directory listings or advertisements. Recently, some companies have begun sending what appears to be a rebate or refund check; in reality, it is a registration for services that is activated when the document is returned with a signature.&quot;

In accounts payable, a simple mistake can cause a large overpayment. A common example involves duplicate invoices. An invoice may be temporarily misplaced or still in the approval status when the vendors calls to inquire into its payment status. After the AP staff member looks it up and finds it has not been paid, the vendor sends a duplicate invoice; meanwhile the original invoice shows up and gets paid. Then the duplicate invoice arrives and inadvertently gets paid as well, perhaps under a slightly different invoice.

==Audits of accounts payable==
Auditors often focus on the existence of approved invoices, expense reports, and other supporting documentation to support checks that were cut. The presence of a confirmation or statement from the supplier is reasonable proof of the existence of the account. It is not uncommon for some of this documentation to be lost or misfiled by the time the audit rolls around. An auditor may decide to expand the sample size in such situations.

Auditors typically prepare an aging structure of accounts payable for a better understanding of outstanding debts over certain periods (30, 60, 90 days, etc.). Such structures are helpful in the correct presentation of the balance sheet as of fiscal year end.

==Automation==
Many companies are involved in work to streamline or automate the business process of their accounts payable departments. This process is straightforward but can become very cumbersome, especially if the company has a very large number of invoices. This problem is compounded when invoices that require processing are on paper. This can lead to lost invoices, human error during data entry, and invoice duplicates. These and other problems lead to a high cost per invoice metric. The goal of automating the accounts payable department is to streamline this invoicing process, eliminate potential human error, and lower the cost per invoice.

Some of the most common AP automation solutions include e-invoicing, scanning of documents, optical character recognition, automation of workflow rules, online tracking, reporting capabilities, electronic invoice user interfaces, supplier networks, payment services and spend analytics for all invoices. Effective automation functions include freeform recognition (ability to interpret invoice documents regardless of layout or the need to create a supplier template) and automatic learning capabilities.

Electronic Invoicing can be a very useful tool for the AP department. Electronic invoicing allows vendors to submit invoices over the internet and have those invoices automatically routed and processed. Because invoice arrival and presentation is almost immediate invoices are paid sooner; therefore, the amount of time and money it takes to process these invoices is greatly reduced. (Financial Operations Networks, 2008) These solutions usually involve a third-party company that provides and supports an application which allows a supplier to submit an electronic invoice to their customer for immediate routing, approval, and payment. These applications are tied to databases which archive transaction information between trading partners. (US Bank, Scott Hesse, 2010) The invoices may be submitted in a number of ways, including EDI, CSV, or XML uploads, PDF files, or online invoice templates. Because E-invoicing includes so many different technologies and entry options, it is an umbrella category for any method by which an invoice is electronically presented to a customer for payment.

Enterprise resource planning systems typically use software to provide integrated business process management services to enterprises.

===History===
Since the mid-1967s companies have begun to establish data links between their trading partners to transfer documents, such as invoices and purchase orders. Inspired by the idea of a paperless office and more reliable transfer of data, they developed the first EDI systems. These systems were unique to the respective company that developed them, meaning they were difficult to deploy across a large number of corporations. Recognizing this, the Accredited Standards Committee X12—a standards institution under the umbrella of ANSI—made preparations to standardize EDI processes. This resulted in what is known today as the ANSI X12 EDI standard.

This remained the main way to exchange transactional data between trading partners for nearly 3 decades. The 1990s came with advances in internet technology. Companies began to appear offering more robust user interface web applications with functions that catered to both supplier and customer. These new web-based applications allowed for online submission of individual invoices as well as EDI file uploads. Along with other methods of file uploads including CSV and XML. These services allow suppliers to present invoices to their customers for matching and approval via a user-friendly web application. Suppliers can also see a history of all the invoices they submitted to their customer without having direct access to the customers&#x27; systems. This is because all the transactional information is stored in the data centers of the third-party company that provides the invoicing web app. This proprietary information can be regulated by the customer in order to control how much transactional information the vendor is allowed to see. (For example, payment dates, or check information).

As companies advance into the digital era, more and more are switching to electronic invoicing services to automate their accounts payable departments to reduce errors and save costs. According to a benchmark study conducted by the IOMA, 19% of organisations surveyed reported a duplicate payment rate of between 0.1% and 0.5%. Some even believe it to be an industry standard in the near future. According to a report done by the GXS team in 2013, Europe is adopting government legislation encouraging businesses to adopt electronic invoicing practices. The United States has no such legislation yet but does recognize the value of this technology. The US Treasury estimated that implementing e-invoicing across the entire federal government would reduce cost by 50% and save $450 million annually.

With the increasing availability of robotic solutions, businesses are driving process improvement in AP even further. By applying end-to-end robotic process automation or RPA to their accounts payable department, organizations can accelerate invoice processing speed and accuracy while improving operational costs. Some organizations report that by implementing RPA they have managed to almost eliminate human intervention from the AP process, thus saving 65% to 75% of the time that was previously had spent on manual processing.

<doc id="454781" wikidata="Q625519" url="?curid=454781" title="Quadratic field">
<text>In algebraic number theory, a quadratic field is an algebraic number field of degree two over formula_1, the rational numbers.

Every such quadratic field is some formula_2 where formula_3 is a (uniquely defined) square-free integer different from formula_4 and formula_5. If formula_6, the corresponding quadratic field is called a real quadratic field, and, if formula_7, it is called an imaginary quadratic field or a complex quadratic field, corresponding to whether or not it is a subfield of the field of the real numbers.

Quadratic fields have been studied in great depth, initially as part of the theory of binary quadratic forms. There remain some unsolved problems. The class number problem is particularly important.

==Ring of integers==
==Discriminant==
For a nonzero square free integer formula_3, the discriminant of the quadratic field formula_9 is formula_3 if formula_3 is congruent to formula_5 modulo formula_13, and otherwise formula_14. For example, if formula_3 is formula_16, then formula_17 is the field of Gaussian rationals and the discriminant is formula_18. The reason for such a distinction is that the ring of integers of formula_17 is generated by formula_20 in the first case and by formula_21 in the second case.

The set of discriminants of quadratic fields is exactly the set of fundamental discriminants (apart from formula_5, which is a fundamental discriminant but not the discriminant of a quadratic field).

==Prime factorization into ideals==
Any prime number formula_23 gives rise to an ideal formula_24 in the ring of integers formula_25 of a quadratic field formula_17. In line with general theory of splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions, this may be

;formula_23 is inert: formula_28 is a prime ideal.
: The quotient ring is the finite field with formula_29 elements: formula_30.
;formula_23 splits: formula_28 is a product of two distinct prime ideals of formula_25.
: The quotient ring is the product formula_34.
;formula_23 is ramified: formula_28 is the square of a prime ideal of formula_25.
:The quotient ring contains non-zero nilpotent elements.

The third case happens if and only if formula_23 divides the discriminant formula_39. The first and second cases occur when the Kronecker symbol formula_40 equals formula_16 and formula_42, respectively. For example, if formula_23 is an odd prime not dividing formula_39, then formula_23 splits if and only if formula_39 is congruent to a square modulo formula_23. The first two cases are, in a certain sense, equally likely to occur as formula_23 runs through the primes—see Chebotarev density theorem.

The law of quadratic reciprocity implies that the splitting behaviour of a prime formula_23 in a quadratic field depends only on formula_23 modulo formula_39, where formula_39 is the field discriminant.

== Class group ==
Determining the class group of a quadratic field extension can be accomplished using Minkowski&#x27;s bound and the Kronecker symbol because of the finiteness of the class group. A quadratic field formula_9 has discriminant
formula_54
so the Minkowski bound isformula_55

Then, the ideal class group is generated by the prime ideals whose norm is less than formula_56. This can be done by looking at the decomposition of the ideals formula_28 for formula_58 prime where formula_59 page 72 These decompositions can be found using the Dedekind–Kummer theorem.

==Quadratic subfields of cyclotomic fields==

===The quadratic subfield of the prime cyclotomic field===
A classical example of the construction of a quadratic field is to take the unique quadratic field inside the cyclotomic field generated by a primitive formula_23th root of unity, with formula_23 an odd prime number. The uniqueness is a consequence of Galois theory, there being a unique subgroup of index formula_62 in the Galois group over formula_1. As explained at Gaussian period, the discriminant of the quadratic field is formula_23 for formula_65 and formula_66 for formula_67. This can also be predicted from enough ramification theory. In fact, formula_23 is the only prime that ramifies in the cyclotomic field, so formula_23 is the only prime that can divide the quadratic field discriminant. That rules out the &#x27;other&#x27; discriminants formula_70 and formula_71 in the respective cases.

===Other cyclotomic fields===
If one takes the other cyclotomic fields, they have Galois groups with extra formula_62-torsion, so contain at least three quadratic fields. In general a quadratic field of field discriminant formula_39 can be obtained as a subfield of a cyclotomic field of formula_39-th roots of unity. This expresses the fact that the conductor of a quadratic field is the absolute value of its discriminant, a special case of the conductor-discriminant formula.

==Orders of quadratic number fields of small discriminant==

The following table shows some orders of small discriminant of quadratic fields. The &quot;maximal order&quot; of an algebraic number field is its ring of integers, and the discriminant of the maximal order is the discriminant of the field. The discriminant of a non-maximal order is the product of the discriminant of the corresponding maximal order by the square of the determinant of the matrix that expresses a basis of the non-maximal order over a basis of the maximal order. All these discriminants may be defined by the formula of .

For real quadratic integer rings, the ideal class number, which measures the failure of unique factorization, is given in OEIS A003649; for the imaginary case, they are given in OEIS A000924.

Some of these examples are listed in Artin, &quot;Algebra&quot; (2nd ed.), §13.8.

<text>Serampore College is located in Serampore, in West Bengal, India. Established in 1818, it is the fourth oldest college in the country after Old Seminary,
Kottayam (Established 1815), CMS College, Kottayam and Presidency College in Kolkata, and one of the oldest continuously operating educational institutes in India. The college consists of two entities: The theological faculty and a separate college with faculties of arts, science, commerce.

The Senate of Serampore College (University) is in charge of the academic administration of all the theological colleges affiliated with it. The council of Serampore College holds a Danish charter and had the power to confer degrees in any subject, which it currently exercises only for conferring theological degrees as recommended by the senate.

Degrees to students at the college in the fields of arts, science and commerce are awarded by the University of Calcutta.

For theology, the college is affiliated to the Senate of Serampore College, with which several theological colleges and seminaries all over India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are affiliated.

==Motto==
The college motto is from Proverbs 3:35 in the Vulgate: &quot;Gloriam Sapientes Possidebunt&quot;, &quot;The wise shall possess glory.&quot;
==Authority to issue degrees and accreditation==
The Serampore Trio - William Ward, William Carey, &amp; Joshua Marshman, started the college with 37 students in 1818. King Frederick VI of Denmark originally granted a Royal Charter giving Serampore College the status of a university to confer degrees on 23 February 1827. It became the third Danish University after the ones in Copenhagen and Kiel. With the later establishment of the University of Calcutta in 1857 the arts, science and commerce parts of Serampore College were affiliated to the University of Calcutta. However, Serampore College still today continues to enjoy the privilege of conferring its own degrees in theology under the power vested by the Charter and Act of Serampore College. It is a private Grant-in-aid Minority College and is recognized by the University Grants Commission under Section 2(f) and 12(b) of the UGC Act, 1956.

==History==

Since Serampore was then a Danish colony, King Frederick VI, the King of Denmark, issued Serampore College its Royal Charter of Incorporation on 23 February 1827, in Copenhagen, Denmark (Charter, 1, Charter, 2, Charter, 3). The charter came in response to Joshua Marshman&#x27;s visit to King Frederick in August 1826; the charter gave Serampore College the privilege of awarding degrees in Arts and Theology. William Carey, Joshua Marshman, and John Clark Marshman (Joshua&#x27;s son) were designated as members of the first Council. At its opening, the Trio released a prospectus which proposed &quot;&quot;A College for the instruction of Asiatic Christian and other Youth in Eastern Literature and European Science&quot;.&quot; The college was open to all persons of any caste or creed, and the founders ensured that no denominational test would apply to faculty members. The charter has also been confirmed by the Bengal Govt Act. IV of 1918.

The status accorded by the Danish Charter has since been re-affirmed for the study of Theology and now forms the basis for degrees of all levels conferred by over forty theological colleges throughout India, and is administered by the Senate.It was incorporated by Royal Charter of 1827 and Bengal Government Act. IV of 1918.

===Founding by English missionaries===
Serampore College is one of the oldest university in India to be in continuous operation. It was founded in 1818 by the English missionaries known as the Serampore Trio:
*William Carey
*Joshua Marshman
*William Ward
Their aim was to give an education in arts and sciences to students of every &quot;caste, colour or country&quot; and to train people for ministry in the growing church in India (See: Christianity in India).

From its beginning the college has been ecumenical but this means that it has no automatic basis of support from any one branch of the Christian church. Prior to 1818, the Serampore Trio had worked together in providing education for their own children and the children, including females, of the native Indians.

===Original charter from Denmark===
Since Serampore was then a Danish colony, King Frederick VI, the King of Denmark, issued Serampore College its Royal Charter of Incorporation on 23 February 1827, in Copenhagen, Denmark (Charter, 1, Charter, 2, Charter, 3). The charter came in response to Joshua Marshman&#x27;s visit to King Frederick in August 1826; the charter gave Serampore College the privilege of awarding degrees in arts and theology. William Carey, Joshua Marshman and John Clark Marshman (Joshua&#x27;s son) were designated as members of the first council. At its opening, the Serampore Trio released a prospectus which proposed &quot;&quot;A College for the instruction of Asiatic Christian and other Youth in Eastern Literature and European Science&quot;.&quot; The college was open to all people of any caste or creed, and the founders ensured that no denominational test would apply to faculty members. The charter has also been confirmed by the Bengal Government Act IV of 1918.

The status accorded by the Danish charter has since been reaffirmed for the study of theology and now forms the basis for degrees of all levels conferred by over forty theological colleges throughout India and is administered by the senate. It was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1827 and the Bengal Government Act IV of 1918.
===Control passed back to the British===
After 22 February 1845 when Denmark sold all of its Indian assets to Britain, the management and operation of the college continued without interruption under the direction of a master and council. In 1856 the Baptist Missionary Society in England took over the management of the college and, in 1857, the college became affiliated with the newly established University of Calcutta and became a constituent college of that university. In 1883 the college closed as an arts college and began functioning as a Christian Training Institution and a theological institute for the Baptist churches in Bengal. Affiliating again with the University of Calcutta in 1911, Serampore College, in 1913, was authorised to award the Bachelor of Arts degree. The college faculty was interdenominational.

===Twentieth century===
On 4 December 1915, the first group of Bachelor of Divinity students graduated:
* I. W. Johory, professor in the Canadian Mission College, Indore;
* N. G. Kuriakos, a priest in the Orthodox Syrian Church; and
* D. M. Devasahayam, London Missionary Society, South India.

Between 1916 and 1927, sixty-nine further students earned their Bachelor of Divinity degrees through Serampore College.

During the centenary year of the college, in 1918, the Bengal Legislative Council passed the Serampore College Act (1918 Act, i, 1918 Act, ii, 1918 Act, iii, 1918 Act, iv) for the purpose of enlarging the college council and forming a new interdenominational senate that would confer theological degrees for all Christian denominations in India. By 1960 twenty other Indian colleges and seminaries affiliated themselves with Serampore.

The name of the college and its founders are honoured today more widely than just within Christian circles – the Carey Library at Serampore houses 16,000 rare volumes and is used by scholars from across the world.

==Principals==
==Departments and courses==
The college offers different undergraduate and postgraduate courses and aims at imparting education to the undergraduates of lower- and middle-class people of Srerampore and its adjoining areas.

===Science===
Science faculty consists of the departments of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Botany, Zoology, Physiology, and Economics.

===Arts &amp; Commerce ===
Arts and Commerce faculty consists of departments of Bengali, English, Communication English, Sanskrit, History, Geography, Political Science, Philosophy, Education, and Commerce (Finance &amp; Accounting).

===Theology===
This faculty consists of different christian religion related subjects.

==Honours==
On 7 June 1969, the Indian Department of Posts issued a stamp and a first day cover depicting Serampore College.
In 2017, to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the university, Denmark&#x27;s ambassador to India, Mr. Peter Taksøe-Jensen announced that the Danish Government decided to grant 18 outstanding students of Serampore College through the King Frederik VI Scholarship.

==Accreditation==
The college is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC). This college was accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council, and awarded A grade.

<doc id="454788" wikidata="Q13372" url="?curid=454788" title="Carrara">
<text>Carrara ( ; ; , ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in Tuscany, in central Italy, of the province of Massa and Carrara, and notable for the white or blue-grey marble quarried there. It is on the Carrione River, some west-northwest of Florence. Its motto is Latin: &quot;
&quot;&quot; (&quot;My strength is in the wheel&quot;), a reference firstly to the marble shipping industry from Roman times onwards.

==Toponymy==
The word &quot;Carrara&quot; likely comes from the pre-Roman (Celtic or Ligurian) element &quot;kar&quot; (stone), through Latin &quot;carrariae&quot; meaning &#x27;quarries&#x27;.

== History ==
There were known settlements in the area as early as the ninth century BC, when the Apuan Ligures lived in the region. The current town originated from the borough built to house workers in the marble quarries created by the Romans after their conquest of Liguria in the early second century BC. Carrara has been linked with the process of quarrying and carving marble since the Roman Age. Marble was exported from the nearby harbour of Luni at the mouth of the river Magra.

In the early Middle Ages it was a Byzantine and then Lombard possession, and then, it was under the Bishops of Luni who started to write the city&#x27;s history when the Emperor Otto I gave it to them. It turned itself into a city-state in the early 13th century; during the struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines, Carrara usually belonged to the latter party. The Bishops acquired it again in 1230, their rule ending in 1313, when the city was given in succession to the Republics of Pisa, Lucca and Florence. Later it was acquired by Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan.
After the death of Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan in 1447, Carrara was fought over by Tommaso Campofregoso, lord of Sarzana, and again the Malaspina family, who moved here the seat of their &quot;signoria&quot; in the second half of the 15th century. Carrara and Massa formed the Duchy of Massa and Carrara from the 15th to the 19th century. Under the last Malaspina, Maria Teresa, who had married Ercole III d&#x27;Este, it became part of the Duchy of Modena.

After the short Napoleonic rule of Elisa Bonaparte, it was given back to Modena. During the unification of Italy age, Carrara was the seat of a popular revolt led by Domenico Cucchiari, and was a center of Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s revolutionary activity.


At the end of the 19th century Carrara became the cradle of anarchism in Italy, in particular among the quarry workers. The quarry workers, including the stone carvers, had radical beliefs that set them apart from others. Ideas from outside the city began to influence the Carrarese. Anarchism and general radicalism became part of the heritage of the stone carvers. According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article of 1894 many violent revolutionists who had been expelled from Belgium and Switzerland went to Carrara in 1885 and founded the first anarchist group in Italy. Carrara has remained a continuous &#x27;hotbed&#x27; of anarchism in Italy, with several organizations located in the city. The Anarchist marble workers were also the driving force behind organising labour in the quarries and in the carving sheds. They were also the main protagonists of the Lunigiana revolt in January 1894.

In 1929, the municipalities of Carrara, Massa and Montignoso were merged in a single municipality, called &quot;Apuania&quot;. In 1945 the previous situation was restored.

Carrara is the birthplace of the International Federation of Anarchists (IFA), formed in 1968.

=== Title ===
As a titular Duke of Modena, the current holder of the title of &quot;Prince of Carrara&quot; would be Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este.

== Economy ==
Carrara marble has been used since the time of Ancient Rome. The Pantheon and Trajan&#x27;s Column in Rome are constructed of it, and many sculptures of the Renaissance were carved from it.

== Culture ==
Fortitude Mea in Rota “My strength in the wheel”. The wheel of the carriage made to transport marble blocks from quarry to load out during Roman Empire and after, is the symbol of Carrara.

<text>Accounts receivable, abbreviated as AR or A/R, are legally enforceable claims for payment held by a business for goods supplied or services rendered that customers have ordered but not paid for. The accounts receivable process involves customer onboarding, invoicing, collections, deductions, exception management, and finally, cash posting after the payment is collected. 

Accounts receivable are generally in the form of invoices raised by a business and delivered to the customer for payment within an agreed time frame. Accounts receivable is shown in a balance sheet as an asset. It is one of a series of accounting transactions dealing with the billing of a customer for goods and services that the customer has ordered. These may be distinguished from notes receivable, which are debts created through formal legal instruments called promissory notes.

Accounts receivable can impact the liquidity of a company.

== Overview ==

Accounts receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products or services on credit. In most business entities, accounts receivable is typically executed by generating an invoice and either mailing or electronically delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within an established timeframe, called &quot;credit terms&quot; or &quot;payment terms&quot;.

The accounts receivable team is in charge of receiving funds on behalf of a company and applying it toward their current pending balances. Collections and cashiering teams are part of the accounts receivable department. While the collections department seeks the debtor, the cashiering team applies the monies received. Businesses aim to collect all outstanding invoices before they become overdue. In order to achieve a lower DSO and better working capital, organizations need a proactive collection strategy to focus on each account.

== Payment terms ==
An example of a common payment term is Net 30 days, which means that payment is due at the end of 30 days from the date of invoice. The debtor is free to pay before the due date; businesses can offer a discount for early payment. Other common payment terms include Net 45, Net 60, and 30 days end of month. The creditor may be able to charge late fees or interest if the amount is not paid by the due date. In practice, the terms are often shown as two fractions, with the discount and the discount period comprising the first fraction and the letter &#x27;n&#x27; and the payment due period comprising the second fraction.

Booking a receivable is accomplished by a simple accounting transaction. However, the process of maintaining and collecting payments on the accounts receivable subsidiary account balances can be a full-time task. Depending on the industry in practice, accounts receivable payments can be received up to 10–15 days after the due date has been reached. These types of payment practices are sometimes developed by industry standards, corporate policy, or because of the financial condition of the client.

Since not all customer debts will be collected, businesses typically estimate the amount of and then record an allowance for doubtful accounts which appears on the balance sheet as a contra account that offsets total accounts receivable. When accounts receivable are not paid, some companies turn them over to third party collection agencies or collection attorneys who will attempt to recover the debt via negotiating payment plans, settlement offers, or pursuing other legal action.

Outstanding advances are part of accounts receivable if a company gets an order from its customers with payment terms agreed upon in advance. Since billing is done to claim the advances several times, this area of collectible is not reflected in accounts receivables. Ideally, since advance payment occurs within a mutually agreed-upon term, it is the responsibility of the accounts department to take out the statement showing advance collectible periodically and should be provided to sales &amp; marketing for collection of advances. The payment of accounts receivable can be protected either by a letter of credit or by Trade Credit Insurance.

== Bookkeeping ==
On a company&#x27;s balance sheet, accounts receivable are the money owed to that company by entities outside of the company. Accounts receivable are classified as current assets assuming that they are due within one calendar year or financial year. To record a journal entry for a sale on account, one must debit a receivable and credit a revenue account. When the customer pays off their accounts, one debits cash and credits the receivable in the journal entry. The ending balance on the trial balance sheet for accounts receivable is usually a debit.

Business organizations that have become too large to perform such tasks by hand (or small ones that could but prefer not to do them by hand) will generally use accounting software on a computer to perform this task.

Companies have two methods available to them for measuring the net value of accounts receivable, which is generally computed by subtracting the balance of an allowance account from the accounts receivable account.

The first method is the allowance method, which establishes a contra-asset account, &quot;allowance for doubtful accounts&quot;, or &quot;bad debt provision&quot;, which has the effect of reducing the balance for accounts receivable. The amount of the bad debt provision can be computed in two ways, either (1) by reviewing each individual debt and deciding whether it is doubtful (a specific provision); or (2) by providing for a fixed percentage (e.g. 2%) of total debtors (a general provision). The change in the bad debt provision from year to year is posted to the bad debt expense account in the income statement.

The allowance method can be calculated using either the income statement method, which is based upon a percentage of net credit sales; the balance sheet approach, which is based upon an aging schedule in which debts of a certain age are classified by risk, or a combination of both.

The second method is the &quot;direct write-off method&quot;. It is simpler than the allowance method in that it allows for one simple entry to reduce accounts receivable to its net realizable value. The entry would consist of debiting a bad debt expense account and crediting the respective accounts receivable in the sales ledger. The direct write-off method is not permissible under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

The two methods are not mutually exclusive, and some businesses will have a provision for doubtful debts, writing off specific debts that they know to be bad (for example, if the debtor has gone into liquidation).

== Special uses ==
Companies can use their accounts receivable as collateral when obtaining a loan (asset-based lending). They may also sell them through factoring. Pools or portfolios of accounts receivable can be sold to third parties through securitization.

For tax reporting purposes, a general provision for bad debts is not an allowable deduction from profit—a business can only get relief for specific debtors that have gone bad. However, for financial reporting purposes, companies may choose to have a general provision against bad debts consistent with their past experience of customer payments in order to avoid overstating debtors in the balance sheet.

<doc id="454790" wikidata="Q5162887" url="?curid=454790" title="Consequences (game)">
<text>Consequences is an old parlour game in a similar vein to &quot;Mad Libs&quot; and the surrealist game &quot;exquisite corpse&quot;.

Each player is given a sheet of paper, and all are told to write down a word or phrase to fit a description (&quot;an animal&quot;), optionally with some extra words to make the story. Each player then folds the paper over to hide the most recent line, and hands it to the next person. At the end of the game, the stories are read out.

==Example game==
The exact sequence varies, but an example sequence given in &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Word Games&quot; is:
# An adjective
# A man&#x27;s name
# The word &quot;met&quot; followed by an adjective
# A woman&#x27;s name
# The word &quot;at&quot; followed by where they met
# The word &quot;to&quot; followed by what they went there for
# The words &quot;he wore&quot; followed by what he wore
# The words &quot;she wore&quot; followed by what she wore
# What he did
# What she did
# The words &quot;and the consequence was&quot; followed by details of what happened as a result
# The words &quot;and the world said&quot; followed by what it said

The same reference book gives the following example of a completed story:

==Variations==
Consequences can also be played in a drawing version, sometimes known as picture consequences, where the first player draws the head, passes it unseen (by means of folding) to the second player who draws the body, then on to the third player who draws the legs. The composite person or creature is then revealed to all by unfolding the paper.

Although Consequences originally is an analogue game there are digital versions available, some of which are slightly modified and adjusted to a digital roam. Examples: FoldingStory™, Unfolding Stories, etc. The game has also been seen as a precursor to computer-generated literature such as Christopher Strachey&#x27;s Love letter generator M.U.C.

<doc id="454794" wikidata="Q307440" url="?curid=454794" title="Abdul Rahman Munif">
<text>Abdul Rahman bin Ibrahim al-Munif (; May 29, 1933 – January 24, 2004), also known as Abdelrahman Munif, was a novelist, short story writer, memoirist, journalist, thinker, and cultural critic. He is considered one of the most significant authors in the Arabic language of the 20th century. His novels include strong political elements as well as mockeries of the Middle Eastern elite classes. He is best-known for &quot;Cities of Salt&quot;, a quintet of novels about how the discovery of oil transformed a traditional Bedouin culture. Munif&#x27;s work offended the rulers of Saudi Arabia, which led to the banning of many of his books and the revocation of his Saudi Arabian citizenship.

==Biography==
Munif was born in 1933 in Amman, Jordan. His grandmother was Iraqi. His &quot;Story of a City: A Childhood in Amman&quot; describes his upbringing there.

In 1952, he moved to Baghdad to study law and later moved to Cairo. He received a law degree from the Sorbonne and a PhD in oil economics from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Economics. He later returned to Iraq to work in the oil ministry and became a member of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. During this time he edited an industry journal called &quot;al-Naft wa al-Tanmiya&quot; &quot;Petroleum and Development&quot;.

He began writing in the 1970s after he left his job with the Iraqi ministry, quit the Ba&#x27;ath party, and moved to Damascus, Syria, removing himself from a regime he opposed. He quickly became known for his scathing parodies of Middle Eastern elites, especially those of Saudi Arabia, a country which banned many of his books and stripped him of his Saudi citizenship. He used his knowledge of the oil industry to full effect, criticizing the businessmen who ran it and the politicians they served.

Munif was the author of fifteen novels. The &quot;Cities of Salt&quot; quintet followed the evolution of the Arabian Peninsula as its traditional Bedouin culture was transformed by the oil boom. The novels portray the history of a broad region, evoking comparisons to William Faulkner&#x27;s Yoknapatawpha County. The quintet begins with &quot;Mudun al-Milh&quot; (مدن الملح, &quot;Cities of Salt&quot;, 1984), depicting the desert oasis of Wadi al-Uyoun as it is transformed and destroyed by the arrival of Western oilmen, a story similar to that of the disrupted village of Chinua Achebe&#x27;s &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. Much as Achebe described the effects of the arrival of powerful missionaries on a traditional African village, so Munif chronicles the economic, social, and psychological effects of the promise of immeasurable wealth drawn from the deserts of nomad and oasis communities. The quintet continues with &quot;Al-ukhdud&quot; (1985;&quot;The Trench&quot;), &quot;Taqasim al-layl wa-al-nahar&quot; (1989; &quot;Variations on Night and Day&quot;), &quot;Al-munbatt&quot; (1989; &quot;The Uprooted&quot;), and &quot;Badiyat al zulumat&quot; (1989; &quot;The Desert of Darkness&quot;). Daniel Burt ranked the quintet as the 71st greatest novel of all time. The last two novels in the series have not been translated into English.

His first novel to appear in English was &quot;Endings&quot;. The translator claimed it was the first Saudi Arabian novel to be translated into English, and hailed its innovative portrayal of rural life and environmental challenges in an Arabic genre which had, until then, focused mostly on urban, middle-class experiences. While Munif&#x27;s works were never particularly successful in the West, throughout the Middle East they are critically acclaimed and extremely popular. &quot;Cities of Salt&quot; was described by Edward Said as the &quot;only serious work of fiction that tries to show the effect of oil, Americans and the local oligarchy on a Gulf country.&quot;

While he was one of the fiercest critics of Saddam Hussein and his regime, he was utterly opposed to the American invasion of Iraq and spent the last two years of his life working on non-fiction projects to oppose what he saw as renewed imperialism. He died in Damascus at the age of 70, of kidney and heart failure.

<text>The Jacksonville Skyway is an automated people mover in Jacksonville, Florida. It opened in 1989 and is operated by the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA). The skyway has three stations in Downtown Jacksonville and was extended in 1996 following a conversion from its original technology to Bombardier Transportation equipment. It was expanded again in 1998 and 2000. The currently fare-free system comprises two routes across of track, serving eight stations, and crosses the St. Johns River on the Acosta Bridge. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per day as of .

, the Skyway typically only operates on weekdays, although JTA does occasionally operate the system on weekends when there are special events downtown.

== Description ==

The Skyway runs on an elevated two-way monorail track. The system serves eight stations in Downtown Jacksonville: five in the Downtown Core and LaVilla areas, and three across the St. Johns River on the Southbank. There are two routes running south from Rosa Parks Transit Station and branching at Central station: one going west and terminating at LaVilla station, and the other going south over the river and terminating at Kings Avenue station on the Southbank.

From 1989 to 1996 the system used VAL 256-type rubber-wheeled vehicles designed by Matra. This ran only on the , three station Phase I-A segment. In 1997, this was replaced by the current system designed by Bombardier Transportation, a version of its UM III monorail technology. In the current system, vehicles run on beams wide and tall, fixed on an wide guideway with parapet walls. Each driverless train operates under automatic train control, travelling at up to , and can have two, four or six cars (although all current trains have two).

The Skyway connects to the JTA&#x27;s bus rapid transit system, known as the First Coast Flyer, at the Jacksonville Regional Transportation Center at LaVilla.

== History ==

=== Planning and development ===
An automated people mover for Downtown Jacksonville was first proposed in 1972 to deal with traffic and parking issues in the urban core. In 1976, the city incorporated the system into its mobility plan, hoping to attract interest from the Urban Mass Transit Administration&#x27;s Downtown Peoplemover Program. The initial study was undertaken by the Florida Department of Transportation and Jacksonville&#x27;s planning department, who took the Skyway project to the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) in 1977 for further development. Early proposals recommended a comprehensive system over long that would connect into adjacent neighborhoods, but the project&#x27;s route and scope were greatly reduced over the years to meet budget constraints and UMTA&#x27;s parameters.

After several stops and starts, UMTA selected Jacksonville as one of seven cities to receive federal funding for the &quot;Automated Skyway Express&quot; in 1985. Two other related projects are Miami&#x27;s Metromover and Detroit&#x27;s People Mover. UMTA&#x27;s approved plan called for the construction of a Phase I system to be built in three segments; the agency awarded JTA $23.5 million for the initial Phase I-A segment.

=== Implementation and expansion ===
In July 1987, JTA selected French company Matra to build the Phase I-A segment. Work was completed in May 1989 at a cost of $34.6 million and revenue service started June 5. At its opening the Skyway served three stations on its east–west route: Central, Jefferson, and Terminal Station and Convention Center (now LaVilla station) on the Northbank of Downtown Jacksonville. Subsequent extensions were planned to take the Skyway north to Florida Community College at Jacksonville (FCCJ), and then south across the St. Johns River over the Acosta Bridge. Development of these routes began in 1992 and 1995, respectively, but negotiations for a new contract with Matra failed when the previous one expired. In October 1994 Bombardier Transportation was awarded a new contract to revamp the existing east–west segment with new technology and to complete the remaining Phase I extensions.

The system was shut down on December 15, 1996, to replace the former Matra technology with Bombardier equipment; the older cars were sold to O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago. The northbound extension was completed, adding the Hemming Plaza (now James Weldon Johnson Park) and Rosa Parks Transit Station stops, and the Skyway reopened on December 15, 1997, with service from the Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center to FSCJ. The southern segment opened on October 30, 1998, adding service to San Marco Station on Jacksonville&#x27;s Southbank. On November 1, 2000, the Riverplace and Kings Avenue Stations opened, completing the Southbank segment and Phase I of the Skyway.

=== Use ===
Ridership on the Skyway has been far below initial projections; while JTA originally anticipated 100,000 riders monthly, it averaged less than a third of that by 2009. The primary reasons are the decline of the downtown workforce and lack of connections to other neighborhoods and modes of transit. The system became a major point of contention in Jacksonville, with critics considering it a &quot;ride to nowhere&quot; and a waste of resources. In 2010, after underperforming for over twenty years, &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; called it &quot;a Jacksonville joke for a generation&quot;. However, others argued that expansion of the system and downtown revitalization could make it a success.

In February 2012, the Skyway was temporarily made free to ride until a new payment system was installed. Ridership jumped 61%—to 481,000 annually. Ridership in 2013 averaged nearly 4,000 on weekdays (the system is closed on weekends except for special events) and JTA renewed the fare-free policy through the end of 2016. , it continues to be free to ride. In light of this momentum, JTA Director Nat Ford has announced the agency will apply for grants to expand the system with a new station in the fast-growing Brooklyn neighborhood.

=== The Skyway now and future plans ===
In December 2015 the Jacksonville Transit Authority announced plans to review the installation and operation citing problems that &quot;Skyway’s current vehicles are so old the parts can no longer be replaced — four of 10 vehicles are out of commission — and JTA staff said industry experts did not respond favorably to the possibility of overhauling them&quot;. The review considered options to refurbish the current rolling stock, buy replacement vehicles, expand the system, tear down the structure or convert it to alternative use such as a walking path. JTA said in January 2017 that they are &quot;trying to keep the Skyway operating for another five years as it determines the future of the system&quot;

As part of the construction of the agency&#x27;s Jacksonville Regional Transportation Center (JRTC), the Convention Center station closed for a period of time to allow for the dismantling of original station elements (such as the overhead station canopy) and construct the new facility partially over the existing tracks. The existing platform was kept but with modifications made in order to tie everything into the new facility. While the new JRTC opened on May 4, 2020, the Skyway did not commence service to the facility until July of that year due to a temporary pause in Skyway service caused by COVID-19.

On March 3, 2021, JTA announced that it had approved plans to convert a portion of its Skyway maintenance facility property off Leila St in the Brooklyn neighborhood to the planned Brooklyn station, with construction to begin in September 2021 and completion projected for some time in early 2022.

==== Ultimate Urban Circulator (U2C) ====

In December 2016 preference was given for replacement of the monorail by shared autonomous vehicles that would see vehicles run on the elevated route currently used by the monorail but also continue on an extended network at street level. The system would have some similarity to personal rapid transit or group rapid transit except at ground level it will either run in mixed traffic or its lanes will have grade crossings with other traffic.

In December 2017, JTA launched the U2C AV Test and Learn track which serves as an outdoor classroom to test and evaluate multiple vehicles and their associated technologies from the AV shuttle industry. As of 2020 vehicles from three different suppliers have been trialed. In 2019 the JTA indicated an interim phase would involve the modification of one of the monorail beams to allow use by autonomous vehicles while the Skyway continues to run on the other side.

JTA revealed more detailed plans in 2020 that the U2C network will have 10 route miles – elevated track and ground level roadways – also covering surrounding suburbs such as San Marco, Springfield, and Brooklyn/Riverside (with the future possibility of connecting it with the proposed First Coast Commuter Rail network).

In May 2021 the Jacksonville City Council voted to remove $132 million from the budget for the U2C, leaving $240 million for the project.

== Stations ==

The Jacksonville Skyway has eight stations on two lines: the Northbank (LaVilla) line, and the Southbank (Kings Avenue) line. All trains run through Rosa Parks Transit Station, James Weldon Johnson Park station, and Central, where they split.

<text>Złotów County () is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Greater Poland Voivodeship, west-central Poland. Its administrative seat and largest town is Złotów, which lies north of the regional capital Poznań. The county contains three other towns: Jastrowie, northwest of Złotów, Okonek, northwest of Złotów, and Krajenka, southwest of Złotów.

The county covers an area of . As of 2011, its total population is 68,791, out of which the population of Złotów is 18,303, that of Jastrowie is 8,485, that of Okonek is 3,855, that of Krajenka is 3,659, and the rural population is 34,489.

==History==
For centuries, the area was part of the Kingdom of Poland and the Greater Poland region (often called the &quot;cradle of Poland&quot;), which beginning in the 10th-century formed the heart of the early Polish state. From 1772 to 1945, it was part of Prussia and Germany, contained mainly in the district called &quot;Kreis Flatow&quot; (Złotów), although parts were in &quot;Kreis Deutsch Krone&quot; (Jastrowie). 

In post-war Poland, Złotów County was in Szczecin Voivodeship from 1946 to 1950, and then in Koszalin Voivodeship until 1975, when the powiats were abolished. From 1975 until 1998, the area was part of Piła Voivodeship. The county was recreated on January 1, 1999, as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998, which reintroduced the powiats and created sixteen larger voivodeships.

==Neighbouring counties==
Złotów County is bordered by Szczecinek County to the northwest, Człuchów County to the northeast, Sępólno County to the east, Piła County to the south, and Wałcz County and Drawsko County to the west.

==Administrative division==
The county is subdivided into eight gminas (one urban, three urban-rural and four rural). These are listed in the following table, in descending order of population.

<doc id="454799" wikidata="Q912227" url="?curid=454799" title="Charles Alvin Beckwith">
<text>Charlie Alvin Beckwith (22 January 1929 – 13 June 1994) was a career United States Army Special Forces officer best remembered for creating Delta Force, the premier counterterrorism and asymmetric warfare unit of the United States Army, based on his experience serving with the British Special Air Service. He served in the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and the Vietnam War, and attained the rank of colonel before his retirement.

==Early life and education==
Beckwith was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on 22 January 1929, to Baptist parents Elza Dozier Beckwith (1894–1940) and Clara Eugenia Beckwith (; 1895–1973). He was an all-state football player for his high school team. He later enrolled in the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the Delta chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and ROTC.

Beckwith lettered in football for the Bulldogs, and was approached by the Green Bay Packers for the 1950–51 NFL draft, but turned it down in favor of a military career. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army in 1952.

==Career==
After the Korean War (1950–1953) was over, then-Second Lieutenant Beckwith served as a platoon leader with Charlie Company, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division in South Korea. In 1955, Beckwith was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division as the commander of the combat support company of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment.

In 1958, after completing Ranger School, Beckwith joined the Special Forces and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group. In 1960, then-Captain Beckwith deployed to Laos for two years on Operation Hotfoot.

In 1962, Beckwith was sent as an exchange officer to the British 22 Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) where he commanded 3 Troop, A Squadron. He conducted war-time guerilla operations with the SAS during the Malayan Emergency. In the jungle, he contracted a case of leptospirosis so severe that doctors did not expect him to survive. However, he made a full recovery within months.

Upon his return from England, Beckwith presented a detailed report outlining the Army&#x27;s vulnerability in not having an SAS-type unit. For several years, Beckwith (who was still a Captain) submitted and re-submitted the report to Army brass, only to be repeatedly thwarted in his efforts. Special Forces leadership at the time thought that they had enough on their hands and did not need the trouble of creating a new unit.

Meanwhile, as the 7th SFG(A) operations officer, Beckwith went to work revolutionizing Green Beret training. Special Forces at the time focused on unconventional warfare, and especially foreign internal defense: i.e. training indigenous personnel in resistance activities. But Beckwith recognized that, &quot;Before a Special Forces Green Beret soldier could become a good &quot;un&quot;conventional soldier, he&#x27;d first have to be a good conventional one... Because I had commanded rifle and weapons companies, I was appalled on arriving in Special Forces to find officers who had never commanded conventional units.&quot; Beckwith restructured 7th&#x27;s training, basically rewriting the book on Army special operations training from the real-world lessons he had learned with the SAS. Beckwith also had learned that a symbol of excellence like a beret had to be earned. Officers were being assigned to Special Forces straight out of war college with no prior special ops experience and were given their Green Beret on arrival. Beckwith instituted the hard-nosed and practical training standards that would lend themselves to the birth of the modern Q-Course.

In 1965, Beckwith volunteered to return to Vietnam where he was selected to command a high-priority special forces unit Project Delta (Operational Detachment B-52). He used his SAS experience to test and select men for long-range reconnaissance operations in South Vietnam. Following his promotion to Major, Beckwith led B-52 in the rescue of the besieged Special Forces camp at the Siege of Plei Me, during which President Lyndon B. Johnson requested to speak to him directly over radio in order to congratulate and encourage him; his iron-fist disciplinarian style of running of the camp is described in detail in CBS News Journalist John Laurence&#x27;s book &quot;The Cat from Hué&quot;.

Beckwith was critically wounded in early 1966 (he took a .50 caliber bullet through his abdomen). It was so bad that medical personnel triaged him as beyond help for the second time in his military career. This time, again, Beckwith made a full recovery and went on to overhaul the Florida Phase of the U.S. Army Ranger School. Beckwith transformed this phase from a scripted exercise based upon the Army&#x27;s World War II experience, into a Vietnam-oriented jungle training regimen.

In 1968, following the Tet Offensive, then-Lieutenant Colonel Beckwith returned to South Vietnam, taking command of the 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry (Airborne), 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. For the nine months that he commanded the 2/327 (“No Slack”), they saw many successes in combat operations, including: Huế, Operation Mingo, Operation Jeb Stuart, Operation Nevada Eagle (clearing the Huế-Phu Bai area), and Somerset Plain (sweeping the southern portion of the A Shau Valley). The toughest job the battalion had was clearing a seven kilometer stretch along Route 547, running west of Huế, eventually defeating the determined NVA defenders so that Fire Support Base Bastogne could be established.

From 1973 to 1974, Beckwith served as commander, Control Team &quot;B&quot; with the Joint Casualty Resolution Center (JCRC) located at RTAFB Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. Under the Command of BG Robert C. Kingston, USA, JCRC&#x27;s sole mission was to assist the Secretaries of the Armed Services to resolve the fate of servicemen still missing and unaccounted for as a result of the hostilities throughout Indochina. JCRC had a predominantly operational role—the carrying out of field search, excavation, recovery, and repatriation activities. He was promoted to colonel and in 1975 returned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina as the Commandant of the U.S. Army Special Warfare School.

===Delta Force===

Although Beckwith had presented proposals throughout the 1960s for a superbly elite, highly autonomous direct-action unit, the idea had sat on the shelf for a decade. Finally, in the mid-&#x27;70s, as the threat of international terrorism became imminent, Beckwith was appointed to form his unit. During the time Beckwith was forming his unit, counter-terrorism duties fell to the special forces community. The 5th Special Forces Group quickly formed the counter-terrorism unit Blue Light to fill in until Delta was fully operational.

1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta was then established on 17 November 1977, by Beckwith and Colonel Thomas M. Henry, as a counterterrorism unit based on the model of the British Special Air Service, but with a greater focus on hostage rescue in addition to covert operations and specialized reconnaissance.

Beckwith led Delta Force&#x27;s first mission, Operation Eagle Claw, the assault on the captured American embassy in Tehran, Iran early in 1980. The mission was aborted due to helicopter failures during a sandstorm and a subsequent crash which led to several deaths. After the &#x27;debacle in the desert,&#x27; the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment was formed to provide aviation support to Delta Force and other special operations units. JSOC was also formed, directly based on Beckwith&#x27;s recommendations during Senate investigations into the mission&#x27;s failure.

==Personal life==
Beckwith was married to Katherine Beckwith, and they had three daughters. One of his daughters, Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Howe, is a former United States Army Reserve major and married to Delta Force Master Sergeant Paul R. Howe, who fought in the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993.

His granddaughter, United States Air Force Technical Sergeant Mary Howe (now Daniell), is an aerial gunner of 4th Special Operations Squadron and the daughter of Paul R. Howe. A second daughter, Margaret, married Mike Kazmierski, a West Point graduate and she served as an army captain in the Judge Advocate Generals Corps (JAG) and her son Zackery Aaron Kazmierski graduated from West Point in 2017.

==Later life and death==
Following his disappointment at the failure of the Iranian operation, Beckwith retired from the Army. He started a consulting firm and wrote a book about Delta Force. In 1994, he died at his home of natural causes.

Beckwith&#x27;s remains are interred in the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, San Antonio, Texas.

<text>A parlour or parlor game is a group game played indoors, named so as they were often played in a parlour. These games were extremely popular among the upper and middle classes in the United Kingdom and in the United States during the Victorian era.

The Victorian age is sometimes considered the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the parlour game. During the 19th century, the upper and middle classes had more leisure time than people of previous generations. This led to the creation of a variety of parlour games to allow these gentlemen and ladies to amuse themselves at small parties. Boxed parlour games were very popular from around 1920 until into the 1960s, especially around Christmas. Parlour games competed for attention with the mass media, particularly radio, movies, and television. Though decreased in popularity, parlour games continue to be played. Some remain nearly identical to their Victorian ancestors; others have been transformed into board games such as Balderdash.

Many parlour games involve logic or word-play. Others are more physical games, but not to the extent of a sport or exercise. Some also involve dramatic skill, such as in charades. Most do not require any equipment beyond what would be available in a typical parlour - i.e. the functioning mouths of the participants. Parlour games are usually competitive, but cumulative scores are not usually kept. The length and ending time of the game is typically not set; play continues until the players decide to end the game.

Parlour games are also interchangeably used with carnival games such as, but not limited to, &quot;ping pong toss&quot;, &quot;dart throwing&quot;, &quot;strong man&quot;, and &quot;dunk water&quot;. These can be played either indoors or outdoors and is usually accompanied with a token prize (i.e. stuffed animal) upon winning.

==Examples==

Examples of parlour games include:

*Aesop&#x27;s Mission
*Are you there, Moriarty?
*Carnelli
*Charades
*Consequences
*Fictionary
*Hunt the thimble
*I packed my bag
*I spy
*Kim&#x27;s Game
*Mafia
*The Minister&#x27;s Cat
*Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
*Twenty questions
*Wink murder

* Drawing room
* Game of dares
* Party game
* Pub game
* Salon
* Tabletop game

<doc id="454810" wikidata="Q6387864" url="?curid=454810" title="Ken James (actor)">
<text>Ken James (born 16 November 1948) is an Australian former actor and celebrity chef. He is most widely known for his role in children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot; as Mark Hammond to which be became known locally and to international audiences After his debut in Skippy, James continued to work in film, television and theatre for another 36 years. In December 2009, James was diagnosed with stage three non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which escalated to stage four by 2011. James started chemotherapy, and as of November 2020 the cancer is in remission. James was also actively involved in the Victorian Police Force as an unsworn member from 1993 to 2013.

==Early life and education==

James was born in Sydney on 16 November 1948 and finished his schooling at Cleveland Street Boys High School. During his time at school, James became particularly interested in school plays, which acted as an impetus to join the acting industry. At the age of 12, a neighbour showed him an advertisement in a newspaper calling for young child actors/models to join the agency. The same year, in 1960, James appeared in the children&#x27;s drama &quot;The Adventurers&quot; produced for ATN-7 Sydney as his first acting role.

==Career==
James has acted in multiple film roles, TV series, musicals and theatrical productions, as well as appearing on various game and news shows. After &quot;Skippy&quot; ended in 1970, James was still on a contract with Fauna Productions for another 12 months, and was cast to play Kip Young in &quot;Barrier Reef&quot; in 1971. James had his 21st birthday during the production of the TV show.

Once &quot;Barrier Reef&quot; ended after a single season, James had recurring roles as television actor Tony Wild in &quot;The Box&quot; (1974-77), Tom Walker in &quot;Glenview High&quot; (1977-78), air traffic controller Simon Young in &quot;Skyways&quot; (1979-80), and Mike O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; (1984-85). 

He has also appeared in smaller roles in series &quot;Matlock Police&quot;, &quot;Pugwall&quot;, &quot;Prisoner&quot;, and made guest appearances in many other TV shows.

==Celebrity chef==
James is passionate about cooking and worked on &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; with Bert Newton for over 10 years as a celebrity chef. He was also involved in the marketing campaign of the cooking aid Ecopot.

James worked as a drama tutor at the Australian Television Academy for 10 years, and also as a Master of Ceremonies for the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital, weddings and private functions at the suggestion of a friend who listed an ad in the Yellow Pages. James didn&#x27;t receive much work as an MC, although he was the Master of Ceremonies for John Knowles&#x27; wedding.

James worked as an adjudicator at the Ararat One Act Play Festival in August 2013, awarding first prize to Erica Smith and Jeanette and Meg Dunn, who performed Snuffuff&#x27;s Emporium of Odds, Sods and Collectibles at Nuworks Theatre.

In August 2013, James was involved in the filming of a comedic advertisement for Sport Rider Pride Mobility Scooter on the original grounds of the &quot;Skippy&quot; set, Sydney&#x27;s Waratah Park. The advertisement involved James hurting his back while repairing a motor bike in front of the Ranger&#x27;s headquarters. Geoff Harvey then rides into the scene on a Pride Mobility Scooter and convinces James to try riding it. James&#x27; on-screen grandson tells James and Harvey that &#x27;Jerry&#x27; is at the gate and needs help, before the two drive off scene on mobility scooters.

James acted in the play &quot;Ladies Night&quot; in 2012 alongside Steven Tandy and Alli Pope (produced by Jally Entertainment). The Australian tour was six months long, and began with a fundraiser in Gympie, Queensland for the charity Little Haven. After the initial fundraiser, the cast went on to perform in 52 other locations.

After the conclusion of the &quot;Ladies Night&quot; tour, James directed &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; for Jally Entertainment in January and February 2013.

==&quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot;==
At the age of 16, four years after joining the acting industry, James was cast as Mark Hammond in the pilot episode of the classic Australian TV show &quot;Skippy&quot;. The series had not been confirmed at the time and James was also offered a scholarship to the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), which he accepted. James left NIDA after four days as the &quot;Skippy&quot; series had been confirmed. He played Mark Hammond over the next three and a half years, starring in 91 episodes. &quot;Skippy&quot; was screened in 128 countries and is still screened around the world today. James&#x27; co-star Garry Pankhurst was cast as Sonny in &quot;Skippy&quot; at the age of 10 and left the acting industry after the show finished 3 years later, as he was overwhelmed by the adulation received from being a child actor. Despite this, James still praises Pankhurst, saying &quot;The camera loved him, and he was very photogenic. He also had a photographic memory; he could look at a page of dialogue and get it down like &quot;bang&quot;. He was extremely natural.&quot;

James and other cast members of &quot;Skippy&quot; were not paid residuals from the TV show. Because of this, Tony Bonner had a falling out with the producers and moved to England to continue working in the acting industry. James has also expressed his own distress at lack of ongoing residuals from &quot;Skippy&quot;.

The debut of &quot;Skippy&quot; was seen as widely controversial in a 1968 context, following the assassination of Robert F Kennedy and Reverent Martin Luther King. James believes this was because &quot;We [Australia] weren’t that sophisticated, quite frankly, when you look at the world stage.&quot;

==Personal life==
James has two children from his first marriage of 24 years. In 2001, James met Rosemarie Stuhlener, a retired Telstra manager who lives in Geelong, and the two were engaged in 2003 and married in 2011. James and Shuttler do not live with each other and do not intend to, making them a living apart together couple.

James has made contributions to multiple charities including Life Education, Variety, and Bali&#x27;s Jodie O’Shea Orphanage.

James was diagnosed with stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2009 after he noticed a lump on his neck while shaving. This cancer then escalated to stage 4 and spread to his bones in 2011, requiring radiotherapy and chemotherapy in order to be treated. James began a chemotherapy course in April 2011 and is now cancer-free, after successfully completing chemotherapy. His diagnosis followed the cancer death of former Skippy cast member Ed Devereaux (oesophagus) in December 2003, and the diagnoses of other Skippy cast members Liza Goddard (breast) and Tony Bonner (prostate) in 1997 and 2004 respectively.

=== Involvement in the Victorian Police Force ===
James was involved in the Victorian Police Force as an unsworn police officer for over 20 years, from 1993 to 2013. He originally assisted the Victorian Police Force in Detective Training School through role-playing in crime re-enactments. James played a bank manager who was robbed, as well as a witness to a sexual assault. James believes in &#x27;the thin blue line&#x27;, and after asking, was later given permission by the Chief Commissioner of the Victorian Police Force at the time, Neil Comrie, to give a 1-hour pro bono lecture on police and detective communication skills with the public and motivation, which he delivered from 1993 to 2013. James has received multiple certificates of appreciation from the Victorian Police Force in regard to his lectures on communication and motivation.

<doc id="454812" wikidata="Q3341403" url="?curid=454812" title="Night of Dark Shadows">
<text>Night of Dark Shadows is a 1971 horror film by Dan Curtis. It is the sequel to &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;. It centers on the story of Quentin Collins and his bride Tracy at the Collinwood Mansion in Collinsport, Maine.

David Selby, Lara Parker, John Karlen, Kate Jackson, Grayson Hall, and Nancy Barrett star.

&quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; was not as successful as &quot;House of Dark Shadows.

This film marked the feature film debut of David Selby and Kate Jackson.

==Plot==
Handsome young artist Quentin Collins arrives at his newly inherited estate of Collinwood with his beautiful wife Tracy. They meet the housekeeper Carlotta Drake and the caretaker Gerard Stiles. Quentin happens upon a 19th-century portrait of a blonde woman with captivating green eyes that seem to mesmerize him. Carlotta informs him that the woman is Angelique, who had lived there over 100 years earlier. The Collins&#x27; friends Alex and Claire Jenkins, who have co-written several successful horror novels, move into a cottage on the estate.

Quentin soon begins to be troubled by startling visions and haunting dreams about one of his ancestors, Charles Collins, and his ancestor&#x27;s mistress Angelique—who had been hanged as a witch in a past century. Carlotta eventually reveals to Quentin that she is the reincarnation of Sarah Castle, a little girl who had lived at Collinwood over 150 years ago, and that Quentin himself is the reincarnation of Charles Collins. Charles had had an affair with Angelique, wife of his brother Gabriel, resulting in her being hanged—and Charles being sealed alive in the family crypt with Angelique&#x27;s corpse.

On a trip to New York, the Jenkinses discover a painting of Charles Collins, which bears an uncanny resemblance to Quentin. Convinced that their friends are in grave danger, the couple hurry home to Collinwood, where they are attacked by the ghost of Angelique.

Meanwhile, Quentin has become possessed by the spirit of Charles Collins, and attempts to drown Tracy in a disused swimming pool on the estate. Alex and Claire arrive in time to revive her, but Quentin, having no memory of his actions, refuses to believe their wild tale.

Carlotta and Gerard conspire to eliminate Quentin&#x27;s loved ones. Quentin, seeing the scratches on his wrist where Tracy had tried to fend him off, realizes the truth of Alex&#x27;s warning and rushes to rescue his friends. Gerard has managed to take Tracy prisoner (despite his having been shot in the face by Claire), and Quentin fights with him high atop a train trestle. As Gerard slashes Quentin&#x27;s cheek with a knife, creating a gash in his left cheek that looks remarkably like the one Charles Collins had, Tracy rushes to try to save her husband. She strikes Gerard with a nearby plank, knocking him off Quentin and onto the edge of the trestle. He teeters on the edge for a moment, then plunges to his death after Tracy pushes him.

The group rush back to Collinwood to confront Carlotta. As they arrive, she jumps from the top of the house when she sees the ghostly Angelique beckon her from below.

In the end, the two couples prepare to leave Collinwood forever. Alex and Claire leave first, with Quentin and Tracy following. However, instead of driving away, Quentin returns to the house, saying he intends to retrieve some canvases. When he fails to come back, Tracy follows, only to find him now completely possessed by Charles Collins. Angelique enters the room, reborn in the flesh. The camera freezes on Tracy&#x27;s face as she begins to scream, as Quentin and Angelique advance on her. A UPI news wire shown at the end reveals that Alex and Claire Jenkins have been killed in a car accident. Witnesses reported seeing a ghostly fog filling the car as it veered off the road.

==Production==
After the success of &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; (the 1970 feature film version of Dan Curtis&#x27;s gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;), MGM was ready to back a follow-up film in 1971. Curtis originally wanted to do a direct sequel and revive the vampire Barnabas Collins. Actor Jonathan Frid, however, refused to play the role again for fear of being typecast. Realizing it would be a mistake to recast the popular character, Curtis worked with writer Sam Hall to concoct an all-new storyline.

On March 29, 1971, filming began on &quot;Curse of Dark Shadows&quot;, later retitled &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; for its release. Without the headaches of producing the television series concurrently, the production crew was able to achieve a far more polished product than that of the previous year. In order to give the production some authenticity, spiritualist Hans Holzer was employed as an advisor to the production, though his actual contribution to the finished product proved minimal.

The story was very loosely based on the &quot;parallel-time&quot; sequence of the TV series and centered on the show&#x27;s other popular male lead, Quentin Collins, played by David Selby. &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; was shot in six weeks on a budget of $900,000 and released in 1971, after the show had left the air. It was not unsuccessful but was less successful than its predecessor.

Hall&#x27;s script, developed in conjunction with Curtis, was a wistful tale of gothic romance and supernatural reincarnation, bolstered by credible performances from David Selby, Kate Jackson, and Grayson Hall. When filming completed without major problems, Curtis set about editing the final film, which proved far denser and more complex than &quot;House of Dark Shadows.&quot;

One reason often cited for the film&#x27;s lack of performance is that MGM forced Curtis to cut over 35 minutes from his finished film, and gave him only 24 hours to do the job. Thus, the film went from approximately 129 minutes to about 94 minutes, which, according to some, caused the film to lose its coherence.

Much of the excised footage was recovered in 1999, but was without sound. This material consists of 16 never-before-seen sequences, extending over a dozen existing scenes, reinstating the darker mood and restoring the original structure and continuity. Highlights of the discovery include flashback between the doomed lovers Charles and Angelique, two new scenes featuring menacing groundskeeper Gerard Stiles, several romantic interludes between Quentin and Tracy, a candlelit &quot;exorcism&quot; sequence in the gallery (the film&#x27;s original climax), and the &quot;hanging&quot; sequence, as well as several other scenes with intensity on par with an R-rated film.

==Home media==
&quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; and &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; were released on VHS on September 1, 1998, and on DVD and Blu-ray on October 30, 2012 by Warner Home Video. Unusually, these releases retain their original GP rating instead of its modern equivalent PG.

<doc id="454818" wikidata="Q1145807" url="?curid=454818" title="The Abominable Dr. Phibes">
<text>The Abominable Dr. Phibes is a 1971 British comedy horror film directed by Robert Fuest, and written by James Whiton and William Goldstein. It stars Vincent Price in the title role, Dr. Anton Phibes, who blames the medical team that attended to his wife&#x27;s surgery four years earlier, for her death and sets out to exact vengeance on each one. He is inspired in his murder spree by the Ten Plagues of Egypt from the Old Testament, although the Ten Plagues in the film&#x27;s Old Testament considerably differ from those in the real world Old Testament. The film co-stars Joseph Cotten, Hugh Griffith, Terry-Thomas, Virginia North, with an uncredited Caroline Munro appearing as Phibes&#x27;s wife.

The film was produced by the UK branch of American International Pictures, and was released by MGM-EMI Distributors in April 1971. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, but has gone on to garner a cult following, with critics singling out Price&#x27;s performance, the film&#x27;s dark humour, and its Art Deco production design. A 2015 &quot;Time Out London&quot; poll ranked the film in the Top 100 Horror Films of All Time.

The film was followed by a direct sequel, &quot;Dr. Phibes Rises Again&quot;, released the following year.

==Plot==
Dr. Anton Phibes, a famous concert organist with doctorates in both music and theology, is believed to have been killed in a car crash in Switzerland in 1921, while racing home upon hearing of the death of his beloved wife, Victoria, during surgery. Phibes survived the crash, but was horribly scarred and left unable to speak. He remade his face with prosthetics and used his knowledge of acoustics to regain his voice. Resurfacing secretly in London in 1925, Phibes believes his wife was a victim of her doctors&#x27; incompetence, and begins elaborate plans to kill those he believes are responsible for her death.

Aided in his quest for vengeance by his beautiful and silent assistant Vulnavia, Phibes uses the Ten Plagues of Egypt as his inspiration, wearing an amulet with Hebrew letters corresponding with each plague as he conducts the murders. After three doctors have been killed, Inspector Trout, a detective from Scotland Yard, learns that they all had worked under the direction of Dr Vesalius, who tells him the deceased had been on his team when treating Victoria, as were four other doctors and one nurse. Trout discovers one of Phibes&#x27;s amulets (torn off during a struggle) at the murder scene of the fourth doctor, which takes place while he is interviewing Vesalius. He first takes it to the jeweller who made it, then to a rabbi to learn its meaning. Now believing Phibes may still be alive, Trout and Vesalius go to the Phibes mausoleum at Highgate Cemetery. Inside, they find a box of ashes in Phibes&#x27;s coffin, but Trout deduces they are probably the remains of Phibes&#x27;s chauffeur. Victoria&#x27;s coffin is empty.

The police are unable to prevent Phibes from killing the remaining members of Vesalius&#x27;s team, so they focus their efforts entirely on protecting Vesalius himself. Phibes kidnaps Vesalius&#x27;s son Lem, then calls Vesalius and tells him to come alone to his mansion on Maldene Square if he wants to save his son&#x27;s life. Trout refuses to let him go, so Vesalius knocks the inspector unconscious and races to Phibes&#x27;s mansion, where he confronts him. Phibes tells him his son is under anaesthesia and prepared for surgery. Phibes has implanted a key near the boy&#x27;s heart that will unlock his restraints. Vesalius has to surgically remove the key within six minutes (the same time Victoria was on the operating table) to release his son before acid from a container above Lem&#x27;s head is released and kills him. Vesalius succeeds and moves the table out of the way. Vulnavia, who was ordered to destroy Phibes&#x27;s mechanical creations, is surprised by Trout and his assistant; backing away, she is drenched with the acid and killed.

Convinced that he has accomplished his vendetta, Phibes retreats to the basement to inter himself in a stone sarcophagus containing the embalmed body of his wife. He proceeds to drain his blood while simultaneously replacing it with embalming fluid and lies down in the sarcophagus next to Victoria. The coffin&#x27;s inlaid stone lid lowers into place, concealing it. Trout and the police arrive but cannot find Phibes. They recall that the &quot;final curse&quot; was darkness just before the basement goes dark.

==Cast==
==Production==

=== Writing ===
The film began as a script by writers James Whiton and William Goldstein. American International Pictures purchased the script, seeing it as a good vehicle for their biggest star, Vincent Price. 

Director Robert Fuest rewrote most of the script, altering Dr Phibes (who in the original script abused his assistant Vulnavia) to be more sympathetic. He also opted to add in some deliberate humour, since critics often razed Price for over-the-top performances, and changed the death of Dr Kitaj by rats to take place on a plane instead of on a boat. Fuest found the boat death implausible, questioning why Kitaj could not save himself by simply jumping into the water. 

The name of Phibes&#x27; wife, &quot;Victoria Regina,&quot; was a nod to the stage play &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;, in which Vincent Price had made his Broadway debut back in 1937.

=== Casting ===
Peter Cushing was originally cast as Dr Vesalius, but bowed out due to the illness of his wife and was replaced by Joseph Cotten. He and Price would later co-star in &quot;Madhouse&quot;.

Caroline Munro was cast as Phibes&#x27;s wife. She took the part despite it being limited to her lying still and silent, and despite objections from Hammer Films, who she was under contract at the time, because she wanted to work with Vincent Price. She could not be credited in the film due to the Hammer contract.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot on the &quot;20s era&quot; sets at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. The cemetery scenes were shot in Highgate Cemetery in London. The exterior of Dr Phibes&#x27;s mansion was Caldecote Towers at Immanuel College on Elstree Road.

Price was reportedly in a good mood during the filming, cooking pâté and other specialty dishes for the cast and crew and telling them stories.

==Music==
The music that Phibes plays on the organ at the beginning of the film is &quot;War March of the Priests&quot; from Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s incidental music to Racine&#x27;s play &quot;Athalie&quot;.

The film&#x27;s incidental score was composed by Basil Kirchin and includes 1920s-era source music, most notably &quot;Charmaine&quot; and &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot;.
One of several music-related errors or anachronisms within the film&#x27;s storyline is the song overlaid as a recorded performance by one of the ostensibly mechanized musicians of &quot;Dr. Phibes&#x27; Clockwork Wizards.&quot; The pianist in this simulated animatronic band &quot;sings&quot; &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot;. Although the film&#x27;s plot is set in England in the 1920s, this particular song did not exist until 1943, when Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer wrote it as part of their film score for &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot;. Fred Astaire sang the jazz standard for the first time in that musical comedy. Likewise, the melody of the song &quot;You Stepped Out of a Dream&quot;, written by Nacio Herb Brown (music) and Gus Kahn (lyrics) and first published in 1940, accompanies a scene depicting Dr. Phibes and Vulnavia dancing together in the ballroom of his mansion. Other musical anachronisms are Vulnavia&#x27;s playing &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; (1933) on the violin, or her placing in a car a music box that plays &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Tune&quot; (1941).

A soundtrack LP was released concurrently with the film&#x27;s appearance, which contained few selections from the score, but rather was composed mostly of character vocalizations by Paul Frees. A proper soundtrack was released on CD in 2004 by Perseverance Records.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;This is Robert Fuest&#x27;s second AIP feature... and his flat, unimaginative visual style dominates every frame. It is the same patchwork mixture of clumsy compositions and endless close-ups which jarred in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, where it made genuine Bronté locations look like a cut-price studio. Here it transforms some obviously expensive art-deco sets into a messy accumulation of props and obliterates all sense of period without adding anything itself. The basically conventional script is not much more inspired, contriving to be coy and tongue-in-cheek without ever being witty, so that one positively longs for the days when horror (and AIP) took itself seriously. This crassness in dialogue and direction is all the more irritating in that aspects of Dr. Phibes suggest that it might have been a reasonably intriguing film: much of the Thirties gadgetry and apparatus is attractively designed, and the pairing of Vincent Price with Joseph Cotten could in the right circumstances have amounted to a stroke of genius. Here, both are effectively emasculated by their roles, with Cotten given little to do and Price in a virtually non-speaking part (for the purposes of the plot he has to be seen to speak through an electronic socket in his neck). Phibes&#x27; ten elaborate curses give rise to a few macabre moments, but the last is rather more disturbing in its suggestion that a sequel is already imminent.&quot;

Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The plot, buried under all the iron tinsel, isn&#x27;t bad. But the tone of steamroller camp flattens the fun.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; was generally positive, praising the &quot;well-structured&quot; screenplay, &quot;outstanding&quot; makeup for Vincent Price, and &quot;excellent work&quot; on the set designs. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars, calling it a &quot;stylish, clever, shrieking winner&quot;, though he disliked &quot;the lack of zip in the ending&quot;. David Pirie of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was negative, faulting director Robert Fuest&#x27;s &quot;flat, unimaginative visual style&quot; and a script &quot;contriving to be coy and tongue-in-cheek without ever being witty&quot;.

In 2002, critic Christopher Null called the film &quot;Vincent Price at his campy best ... A crazy script and an awesome score make this a true classic.&quot;

In the early 2010s, &quot;Time Out London&quot; conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; placed at number 83 on their top 100 list.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; juggles horror and humor, but under the picture&#x27;s campy façade, there&#x27;s genuine pathos brought poignantly to life through Price&#x27;s performance.&quot; The film was not highly regarded by American International Pictures&#x27; home office until it became a box office success.

==Home video==
MGM Home Entertainment released &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; on Region 1 DVD in 2001, followed by a tandem release with &quot;Dr. Phibes Rises Again&quot; in 2005. The film made its Blu-ray debut as part of Scream Factory&#x27;s Vincent Price box set on 22 October 2013.

A limited edition two-disc set, &quot;The Complete Dr. Phibes&quot;, was released in Region B Blu-ray on 16 June 2014 by Arrow Films. Both films were later reissued separately by Arrow and as part of the nine-film/seven-disc Region B Blu-ray set &quot;The Vincent Price Collection&quot; on the Australian Shock label.

The TV broadcast version of the film excises some of the more grisly scenes, such as a close-up of the nurse&#x27;s locust-eaten corpse.

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;Dr. Phibes Rises Again&quot;, was released in 1972. It was also directed by Fuest and also stars Price as Phibes. Several other sequels were proposed, including &quot;The Bride of Dr. Phibes&quot;, but none was ever produced.

<text>The Molly Brown House Museum (also known as House of Lions) is a house in Denver, Colorado, United States that was the home of American philanthropist, activist, and socialite Margaret Brown. She survived the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; and was known as the &quot;Heroine of the Titanic&quot; for her service to survivors. She later became known as &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;. The museum is her former home and presents exhibits interpreting her life, Victorian Denver and historic preservation. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is designated as a Denver Landmark.

==History==
The house was designed by architect William A. Lang, and built in 1889, incorporating several popular styles of the period, including Queen Anne style architecture in the United States and Richardsonian Romanesque for the original owners Isaac and Mary Large. After the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893, the Large family sold the house. It was purchased by James Joseph Brown (J.J.), Margaret&#x27;s husband, in 1894 for US$30,000 and the title was transferred to Margaret in 1898, possibly due to J.J.&#x27;s deteriorating health.
Margaret and the family traveled frequently, and so the house was often rented out. In 1902, it was the governor&#x27;s mansion for the Governor of Colorado and his family (Margaret invited the governor and his family to use her home while the governor&#x27;s mansion was undergoing remodeling). In 1926, Margaret turned the home into a boarding house under the supervision of her housekeeper. The house was sold after Margaret&#x27;s death in 1932, for $6,000. The home then became a rooming house for men, a Jane Addams Hull House settlement, and rooms and apartments for rent.

===Restoration and after===
The house continued to deteriorate and by 1970 concerns arose about its impending demolition, but a group of concerned citizens formed Historic Denver, Inc., raising the funds for the house to be restored to its former state. While restoring the home, the group used architectural research, paint chip analysis, and original photographs taken in 1910 as guides. The home is owned by Historic Denver, Inc., and public tours are run daily for a fee. It has been a museum since 1971.
There is a trail marker outside the home as part of the National Votes for Women Trail; the marker was stolen in November 2023, but was found later that month.

<doc id="454827" wikidata="Q336683" url="?curid=454827" title="Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington">
<text>Michael Dunlop Young, Baron Young of Dartington (9 August 1915 – 14 January 2002), was a British sociologist, social activist and politician. Young was an urbanist, known as an academic researcher, polemicist and institution-builder.

During his career, Young was influential in shaping the policy and ideology of the Labour Party. As secretary of the policy committee of the Labour Party, he was responsible for drafting &quot;Let Us Face the Future&quot;, Labour&#x27;s manifesto for the 1945 general election. Young was a leading advocate for social reform, and in that capacity he founded or helped to found a number of organisations. These include the Consumers&#x27; Association, &quot;Which?&quot; magazine, the National Consumer Council, the Open University, the Institute for Community Studies, the National Extension College, the Open College of the Arts and Language Line, a telephone-interpreting business.

==Early life and education==

Young was born in Manchester, the son of Ernest Gibson Young, an Australian violinist and music critic, and Edith Hermia Dunlop, an Irish Bohemian painter and actress. According to Michael&#x27;s son, Toby, Gibson was a &quot;ne&#x27;er-do-well&quot;, and &quot;the only silver his forebears possessed was what they were able to steal from the gentry.&quot;

Young grew up in Melbourne. He returned to England at the age of eight, shortly before the end of his parents&#x27; marriage. There he attended several schools, eventually entering Dartington Hall, a new progressive school in Devon, in the 1920s. He had a long association with the small school, as student, trustee, deputy chairman and historian. He studied economics at the London School of Economics (BScEcon, MA), then became a barrister when he applied to be called to the Bar in 1939.

Young began studying for a PhD at the LSE in 1952. His thesis, dated 1955, was titled A study of the extended family in East London.

==Social research and community activism==
During the Second World War, Young served as director of the Political and Economic Planning think tank and became director of research for the Labour Party, where he wrote the manifesto for the 1945 general election and the vast speakers&#x27; handbook. He served under the Labour government led by Clement Attlee. In 1947, he called for the establishment of a Social Science Research Council and became its first director 17 years later. He left the Labour Party in 1950, saying the party had run out of ideas.

Young&#x27;s studies of housing and local government policy in East London, which developed from his doctoral thesis, left him disillusioned with the state of community relations and local Labour councillors. This prompted him to found the Institute of Community Studies, which was his principal vehicle for exploring his ideas of social reform. Its basic tenet was to give people more say in running their lives and institutions. Lise Butler argues that the Institute drew upon existing bodies of research in social psychology and sociology to highlight the relevance of the extended family in modern society and to offer a model of socialist citizenship, solidarity and mutual support not tied to productive work. Young promoted the supportive kinship networks of the urban working class, and an idealized conception of the relationships between women, to suggest that family had been overlooked by the left and should be reclaimed as a progressive force. The goal was to strengthen the working-class family as a model for cooperative socialism.

He also founded the Mutual Aid Centre at this time. Young co-authored (with Peter Willmott) &quot;Family and Kinship in East London&quot;, documenting and analysing the social costs of rehousing a tight-knit community in a suburban housing estate (known affectionately by sociologists as &quot;Fakinel&quot; and invariably pronounced with a cockney accent).

In 1958, Young wrote the influential satire &quot;The Rise of the Meritocracy&quot; for the Fabian Society, which refused to publish it. The book critiques the concept of &quot;meritocracy&quot; as unachievable and undesirable, describing a dystopian future of a society in which &quot;IQ + effort&quot; have replaced all other values.

Young&#x27;s social research also contributed to the change in secondary education that led to widespread abolition of grammar schools and their replacement by comprehensive schools between 1965 and 1976, as well as the abolition of the 11-plus.

Although unwilling to maintain a conventional academic career, Young was a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, from 1961 to 1966, and president of Birkbeck, University of London, from 1989 to 1992.

==Organisational activity==
An energetic and resourceful man, Young established many new organisations with the aim of providing &quot;bottom-up&quot; practical help to ordinary citizens. In the 1950s and 1960s he helped to found the Consumers&#x27; Association and the National Consumer Council, claiming that &quot;politics will become less and less the politics of production, and more and more the politics of consumption,&quot; presenting the ideas in a booklet, &quot;The Chipped White Cups Of Dover&quot; (1960).

In 1960, he started the Advisory Centre for Education the National Extension College and, with Peter Laslett, a dawn university on Anglia Television, which became prototypes of the Open University which Harold Wilson launched in 1964, building on his vision.

In the mid-1980s, Young co-founded International Alert, together with Leo Kuper and Martin Ennals. Later on that decade, in 1987, he founded the Open College of the Arts, confounding critics who maintained that the arts could not be taught by distance methods. He also founded Language Line, a telephone interpreting business, to enable non-English-speaking people to have equal access to public services. He fostered the work of many younger researchers and &quot;social entrepreneurs,&quot; and founded the School for Social Entrepreneurs in 1997. Aspects of Young&#x27;s work were developed by the Young Foundation, created from the merger of his Institute of Community Studies and his Mutual Aid Centre, under the direction of Geoff Mulgan.

Throughout his life, and particularly in later life, Young was concerned for older people. In 1982 he co-founded the University of the Third Age with Peter Laslett and Eric Midwinter, and Linkage, bringing together older people without grandchildren and young people without grandparents. In 2001 he co-founded the charity Grandparents Plus to champion the role of the wider family in children&#x27;s lives.

==Later political career==
Although he maintained steadfast egalitarian convictions, Young accepted a life peerage on 20 March 1978, taking the Labour whip and the title Baron Young of Dartington, &quot;of Dartington in the County of Devon&quot;. His many projects required frequent travel to London, and the peerage offered free rail travel and attendance allowance at a time when he had run out of money.

In 1981, Young defected from Labour to the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and was one of 100 supporters whose names were published alongside the SDP&#x27;s founding statement, the Limehouse Declaration, that February. Although hitherto largely aloof from the factionalism then devouring Labour, Young&#x27;s disregard for the statist and trade union-oriented aspects of its post-war social-democratic philosophy meant he was receptive to the idea of a new progressive party forming in its stead (he had already tentatively advocated the formation of a &quot;Consumers&#x27; Party&quot; in &quot;The Chipped White Cups of Dover&quot;). Upon joining the SDP, he became a member of the party&#x27;s policy committee and director of its in-house think tank, The Tawney Society.

An associate of the SDP&#x27;s second leader, David Owen, Young refused to back the party&#x27;s merger with the Liberal Party in 1988 and instead followed Owen into the &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP. A year later he chose to return to Labour following, in Owen&#x27;s words, Labour&#x27;s &quot;big switch on the EEC, market economics and Trident.&quot; Young remained sceptical of Labour&#x27;s ability to win the next election and believed that it still had to face up to the task of modernising socialism, which had, he said, &quot;lagged so badly since Tony Crosland died.&quot;

According to Young&#x27;s friend Eric Midwinter, &quot;All his thought, all his incisive writing, all his brilliantly conceived schemes, all his astutely handled initiatives were guided by a salient method. He was a utopian socialist. His thinking stemmed from the views of 19th-century radicals like Robert Owen, Saint-Simon or Charles Fourier, with their hatred of massive institutionalism, be it in the hands of the public authority or of the large commercial company.&quot;

==Personal life==
Young married three times. In 1945 he married Joan Lawton, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. They later divorced, and in December 1961 he married Sasha (daughter of Raisley Stewart Moorsom and a descendant of Admiral Sir Robert Moorsom), a novelist, sculptor and painter with whom he had a daughter (who was born before their marriage) and a son, the journalist and writer Toby Young. Young and Moorsom worked together on several projects, including in the townships of South Africa. Moorsom died in 1993 and in 1995 Young married 37-year-old milliner Dorit Uhlemann, with whom he had a daughter Gaia, who died in July 2021 aged 25.

<text>Wright State University is a public research university in Fairborn, Ohio, United States. Originally opened in 1964 as a branch campus of Miami University and Ohio State University, it became an independent institution in 1967 and was named in honor of aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright, who were residents of nearby Dayton. The university offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees and is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It is a member of the University System of Ohio. Its athletic teams, the Wright State Raiders, compete in Division I of the NCAA as members of the Horizon League. In addition to the main campus, the university also operates a regional campus near Celina, Ohio, called Wright State University–Lake Campus.

==History==
===Founding===
Wright State University first opened in 1964 as a branch campus of Miami University and Ohio State University, occupying only a single building. Groundwork on forming the institution began in 1961 during a time when the region lacked a public university for higher education. A community-wide fundraising effort was conducted in 1962 to establish the university, and the campaign raised the $3 million needed in seed money. Much of the land that the campus was built on was donated by the United States Air Force from excess acreage of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

The Ohio General Assembly passed legislation in 1965 that transformed the branch campus into a separate institution with its own Advisory Committee on November 5, 1965. It was anticipated the campus would achieve full independent status by 1967 with its rapidly increasing enrollment of full-time students, projected to reach 5,000 within two years. On October 1, 1967, the campus officially became Wright State University following a decision by the Ohio Board of Regents. The name honors the Wright brothers, well-known Dayton residents who are credited with inventing the world&#x27;s first successful airplane. In 1969, a branch campus opened on the shore of Grand Lake St. Marys in Celina, Ohio.

===2017–present===
Wright State University celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017, creating a website to highlight milestones and events throughout the university&#x27;s history. The celebration culminated at Homecoming on September 30 – October 1, 2017. That same year, the university officially became tobacco-free on its Dayton and Lake campuses. Smoking cessation products, such as nicotine-replacement gum, lozenges, and patches were not banned. The tobacco-free decision was made following a recommendation in 2012 from the Ohio Board of Regents that all public universities in Ohio transition to tobacco-free campuses.

Wright State&#x27;s faculty, which are unionized and represented by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), went on strike in 2019 following two years of failed contract negotiations. The faculty were joined by various groups, including other labor unions, community members, and a student-led labor rights group called Students for Faculty. An agreement was reached the following month, ending the strike, but its length of twenty days was the longest in Ohio history among higher education institutions and one of the longest in US history

Susan Edwards became university&#x27;s president on January 1, 2020. Previous university presidents were Brage Golding (1966–1973), Robert J. Kegerreis (1973–1985), Paige E. Mulhollan (1985–1994), Harley E. Flack (1994–1998), Kim Goldenberg (1998–2006), David R. Hopkins (2007–2017), and Cheryl B. Schrader (2017–2019). Curtis L. McCray was the interim president from March 17 through June 30, 2017, holding the position following Hopkins&#x27; early retirement on March 17, 2017. Schrader was Wright State&#x27;s seventh president—and first female president—from mid 2017 until she stepped down at the end of 2019 midway through her five-year appointment.

===Politics===
====2008 presidential campaign====
During the 2008 United States presidential campaign, Republican nominee John McCain announced his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate and choice for vice president on August 29, 2008, at Wright State. Palin was a relatively unknown figure at the time and the current Governor of Alaska, but soon became a major figure in modern American politics. Eventual winner Barack Obama, who became the first African-American president in American history, held a major rally at Wright State during the campaign as well.

====2016 presidential campaign====
On September 23, 2015, the Commission on Presidential Debates named Wright State the host for the first 2016 United States presidential debate, which was scheduled for September 26, 2016 at the Nutter Center. On July 19, 2016, Wright State University backed out of the debate, citing inability to cover the cost of security.

The school adopted its current name in 2005 in honor of the Oscar Boonshoft family, major donors to the medical school.

===Reserve Officer Training Corps===
Wright State University offers Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) and Army ROTC programs on campus, known as Detachment 643 and the Raider Battalion, respectively. The Air Force ROTC program contains the cross town schools of the University of Dayton, Cedarville University, and Sinclair Community College.

=== Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-Enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) ===
Kno.e.sis center was founded in 2007. In 2009, the Ohio Department of Higher Education established more than 50 Centers of Excellence representing key industrial areas with potential future growth. Kno.e.sis at the Wright State University was one of the selections in the area of Bio-Health Innovations. Research at the center focuses on multidisciplinary areas such as Web 3.0 (Semantic Web, Semantic Sensor Web), Network Science, Social Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Bioinformatics, Natural Language Processing, Visualization, Cloud Computing, High Performance Computing.

In recent years, Kno.e.sis has had near 80–100 researchers including 15 faculty and over 60 funded graduate (primarily PhD) students. Kno.e.sis researchers overtime have contributions in the areas related to Computer Science with focus on topics in World Wide Web, including Semantic web, Social Data Analysis, Semantic Sensor Web, and Linked Open Data. Furthermore, they have been a part of developing technical specifications and guidelines for W3C, until 2013.

===Collaboration, Education, Leadership, and Innovation in the Arts===
In the fall of 2009, Wright State University&#x27;s three departments of Art, Music, and Theatre, Dance, &amp; Motion Pictures inaugurated a new initiative of collaborative artistic and educational endeavor, called CELIA (Collaboration, Education, Leadership, and Innovation in the Arts), dedicated to enhancing &quot;ongoing collaborations as well as nurture new partnerships.&quot; Projects accepted for the CELIA designation demonstrate high-quality, innovative collaborations, and the ability to further strengthen the reputation of the arts at Wright State.

One of the first of these projects was the Academy Award-nominated half-hour documentary &quot;The Last Truck&quot;, produced for HBO and broadcast on Labor Day, 2008. The film documented the closing of a major GM truck plant in Moraine, Ohio, in 2008. More recently, the Department of Theatre, Dance and Motion Pictures co-produced the regional and university premiere production of in the fall of 2010, with the region&#x27;s professional theatre, The Human Race Theatre Company. In May 2011, the departments of Music and Theatre, Dance and Motion Pictures collaborated with the Dayton Philharmonic a full-stage production of the &quot;Mass&quot; by Leonard Bernstein at the Benjamin and Marian Schuster Performing Arts Center in Dayton.

On October 20, 2011, CELIA was designated an Ohio Center of Excellence by Jim Petro, Chancellor of the Ohio Board of Regents at a press conference on the campus of Wright State University, in which Tom Hanks congratulated the Wright State University arts programs via a video message.

<text>A payroll is a list of employees of a company who are entitled to receive compensation as well as other work benefits, as well as the amounts that each should obtain. Along with the amounts that each employee should receive for time worked or tasks performed, payroll can also refer to a company&#x27;s records of payments that were previously made to employees, including salaries and wages, bonuses, and withheld taxes, or the company&#x27;s department that deals with compensation. A company may handle all aspects of the payroll process in-house or can outsource aspects to a payroll processing company.

Payroll in the U.S. is subject to federal, state and local regulations including employee exemptions, record keeping, and tax requirements.

In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards cloud-based payroll solutions. These platforms offer advantages such as cost savings, scalability, and real-time data access, making them increasingly popular among businesses of all sizes. According to a report by USD Analytics, the global cloud-based payroll software market is projected to grow from $10.8 billion in 2023 to $20.5 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6%.

==Frequency==
Companies typically process payroll at regular intervals. This interval varies from company to company and may differ within the company for different types of employee.

According to research conducted in February 2022 by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the four most common pay frequencies in the United States were:

* Weekly — 31.8% — Fifty-two 40-hour pay periods per year and include one 40 hour work week for overtime calculations.
* Biweekly — 45.7% — Twenty-six 80-hour pay periods per year, consisting of two 40 hour work weeks for overtime calculations.
* Semi-monthly — 18.0% — Twenty-four pay periods per year with two pay dates per month. Compensation is commonly paid on either the 1st and the 15th day of the month or the 15th and the last day of the month and consists of 86.67 hours per pay period.
* Monthly — 4.4% — Twelve pay periods per year with a monthly payment date. Each monthly payroll consists of 173.33 hours.

This frequency changes based on the establishment size, or the maximum number of employees within the business over the previous 12 months.

==Components==

=== Gross pay ===
Gross pay, also known as gross income, is the total payment that an employee earns before any deductions or taxes are taken out. For employees that are hourly, gross pay is calculated when the rate of hourly pay is multiplied by the total number of regular hours worked. If the employee has overtime hours, these are multiplied by the overtime rate of pay, and the two amounts are added together. Also included in gross pay is any other type of earnings that an employee may have. These may include holiday pay, vacation or sick pay, bonuses, and any miscellaneous pay that the employee may receive.

=== Deductions ===
There are a wide array of voluntary deductions that can be taken out of an employee&#x27;s gross pay, some of which are taken out before taxes and some being taken out after taxes.
Pre-tax deductions are deductions that are taken out of an employee&#x27;s gross pay amount before it is subject to tax. and could include health, dental, or life insurance, deductions for certain retirement accounts, or deductions for FSA or HSA accounts.

After-tax deductions are deductions that are occur after taxes have been taken out of an employee&#x27;s pay.

=== Reimbursements ===
Payroll components may include reimbursements for some expenses that an employee bears on behalf of the company. In many cases this helps an employee save taxes. An employee typically has to submit some bills to validate the actual amounts. This has to then be approved typically by their manager and finance team. Some common reimbursement components in Indian Payroll include Telephone Bills, Driver Salary, Fuel Reimbursements etc.

=== Taxes ===
Various levels of government require employers to withhold various types of income tax and payroll tax. In the United States, payroll taxes are used to support Social Security and Medicare costs while income taxes are used for other federal and state programs. In Canada, payroll taxes are used to support the government&#x27;s Pension Plan (CPP or QPP) and Employment Insurance program (EI) while income taxes are used to fund public healthcare and other federal and province/territory programs.

=== Wage garnishments ===
A wage garnishment is a court-ordered method of collecting overdue debts that require employers to withhold money from employee wages and then send it directly to the creditor. Wage garnishments are post-tax deductions, meaning that these mandatory withholdings do not lower an employee&#x27;s taxable income. Unpaid debts that may result in wage garnishments include credit card bills and medical bills, child support and alimony, federal student loans, and tax levies. Each of these garnishments may have different limit on the amount that may be deducted.

=== Net pay ===

Net pay is the total amount that an employee receives after all required and voluntary deductions are taken out.

==Outsourcing==
Businesses may decide to outsource their payroll functions to an outsourcing service like a Payroll service bureau or a fully managed payroll service. These can normally reduce the costs involved in having payroll trained employees in-house as well as the costs of systems and software needed to process a payroll. Where this may reduce the cost for some companies many will foot a bigger bill to outsource their payroll if they have a specially designed payroll program or payouts for their employees. In many countries, business payrolls are complicated in that taxes must be filed consistently and accurately to applicable regulatory agencies. For example, restaurant payrolls which typically include tip calculations, deductions, garnishments, and other variables, can be difficult to manage especially for new or small business owners. Another reason is that company leaders do not have the time to payroll work.

In the UK, payroll bureaus will deal with all HM Revenue &amp; Customs inquiries and deal with employee&#x27;s queries. Payroll bureaus also produce reports for the businesses&#x27; account department and payslips for the employees and can also make the payments to the employees if required. As of 6 April 2016, umbrella companies are no longer able to offset travel and subsistence expenses and if they do, they will be deemed liable to reimburse HMRC any tax relief obtained. Furthermore, recruitment companies and clients may be potentially liable for the unpaid tax.

Another reason many businesses outsource is because of the ever-increasing complexity of payroll legislation. Annual changes in tax codes, &quot;Pay as you earn&quot; (PAYE) and National Insurance bands, as well as statutory payments and deductions having to go through the payroll, often mean there is a lot to keep abreast of to maintain compliance with the current legislation.

On the other hand, businesses may also decide to utilize payroll software to supplement the efforts of a payroll accountant or office instead of hiring more payroll specialists or outsourcing to a payroll company. Payroll software bases its calculation on entered rate, approved data obtained from other integrated tools like the electronic Bundy clock, and other essential digital HR tools.

<text>The University of Dayton (UD) is a private, Catholic research university in Dayton, Ohio, United States. Founded in 1850 by the Society of Mary, it is one of three Marianist universities in the US and the second-largest private university in Ohio. Its campus is located in southern Dayton and spans 388 acres on both sides of the Great Miami River. The campus is noted for the Immaculate Conception Chapel and the University of Dayton Arena.

As of 2023, the university enrolls approximately 11,300 undergraduate and postgraduate students from a variety of religious, ethnic and geographic backgrounds. It offers more than 80 academic programs in the arts, sciences, business, education, health sciences, engineering, and law. In 2009, UD offered what it believes to be one of the first undergraduate degree programs in human rights. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

==History==
===Founding===
In 1849, on a mission to establish a presence for the Society of Mary in America, Leo Meyer journeyed from Alsace in France to Cincinnati. But with a cholera epidemic raging to the north, Bishop John Baptist Purcell of the Cincinnati diocese, sent Meyer to Emmanuel parish in Dayton to tend to the sick. In Dayton, Meyer met local farmer John Stuart, who had lost his infant daughter Mary Louisa to cholera the year before. Heartbroken, Stuart and his wife wanted to sell their Dewberry Farm property and return to Europe.

On March 19, 1850, Meyer, joined by three Marianist brothers—teacher Maximin Zehler, cook Charles Schultz and gardener Andrew Edel—purchased the hilltop farm from Stuart and renamed it Nazareth. Stuart accepted a St. Joseph medal and a promise of $12,000 at 6 percent interest. The property included vineyards, an orchard, a mansion, various farm buildings, and the grave of Stuart&#x27;s daughter, which Meyer promised to maintain.

Just a few months later, the University of Dayton had its beginnings on July 1, 1850, when St. Mary&#x27;s School for Boys opened its doors to 14 primary students from Dayton. In September, the first boarding students arrived and classes moved to the mansion. Five years later, the school burned to the ground, but classes resumed within months. By 1860, when Zehler became president, the enrollment was nearly 100 students. The Civil War had a little direct effect on the school because most of the students were too young to serve. College preparatory classes started in 1861 along with a novitiate and school for Marianist candidates. The school would become Chaminade High School, named after the order&#x27;s founder William Joseph Chaminade, which has since merged with the all-girls Julienne High school run by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur to form the co-educational Chaminade-Julienne High School.

The core of the Historic Campus was built during this time, starting in 1865 with Zehler Hall, the iconic Immaculate Conception Chapel in 1869, and St. Mary&#x27;s Hall, then the tallest building in Dayton in 1870. In 1882 the university was incorporated and empowered to confer collegiate degrees by the State of Ohio.

=== Key events ===
When floodwaters struck the community during the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, refugees fled to St. Mary&#x27;s College high on a hill south of downtown Dayton. St. Mary&#x27;s College was uniquely situated and equipped to provide relief to flood victims. Because students had not returned to campus from Easter break, the college was amply stocked with food and other provisions. Due to its location on the hill, electric light and heating plants were not affected, a plentiful clean water supply was available and the college had other essential facilities such as laundry and infirmary. The college&#x27;s kitchen provided meals to Miami Valley Hospital and provided of provisions to St. Elizabeth Hospital. The first night, 400 refugees took shelter at St. Mary&#x27;s College; by the end of the week, the number had grown to 600. In all, the college assisted 800 refugees. 
Known at various times as St. Mary&#x27;s School, St. Mary&#x27;s Institute and St. Mary&#x27;s College, the school was incorporated as the University of Dayton in 1920 to reflect its close connection with the city of Dayton as well as to claim an American identity for its Catholic students.

In 1923, the university adopted the &quot;Dayton Flyers&quot; nickname for its athletic teams and adopted a university seal with the motto, &quot;Pro Deo et Patria&quot;, Latin for &quot;For God and Country.&quot; In the 1930s, women were admitted on an equal basis with men—40 years before most Catholic universities allowed women. The school expanded its science and engineering programs and continued to attract the children and grandchildren of Catholic immigrants.

The growing Catholic presence in Dayton during the 1920s drew the hostility of the Ku Klux Klan, which focused that hostility toward the university. On December 19, 1923, 12 bombs exploded throughout the campus and an cross was set on fire. Several hundred Klansmen were routed by hundreds of neighborhood residents who joined students in chasing them off.

In June 2014, The University of Dayton announced it will begin divesting coal and fossil fuels from its $670 million investment pool. It is believed to be the first Catholic university in the nation to take this step.

=== Growth and expansion ===
Starting in the 1960s, the university began acquiring hundreds of single-family homes and duplexes in the neighborhoods adjacent to the campus for student housing, extending the campus to Brown Street. In 2007, the university built five new townhouses and renovated four homes in a Citirama project with the Home Builders Association of Dayton.

In 2005, the university acquired a parcel of land for $25 million that had once housed the cash register factory complex of the NCR Corp. The purchase extended the university&#x27;s boundaries west to the Great Miami River and increased the total acreage to 216 acres.

In 2009, the university announced the purchase of another 115 acres from NCR for $18 million, including the former NCR World Headquarters and Old River Park, the former NCR employees&#x27; recreation area, extending the campus to 373 acres. The former NCR world headquarters, renamed as the 1700 South Patterson Building, now houses the University of Dayton Research Institute, classrooms, offices, and meeting space.

In 2010, GE Aviation announced it would build the $51 million GE Aviation Dayton Electrical Power Research Lab research and development facility on eight acres of the campus, becoming the first major new development on the former NCR land.

In 2012, the campus totaled approximately 388 acres and included 38 academic, research, athletic and administrative buildings, five residence halls, 18 student apartment complexes, and 473 residences, including 347 university-owned residences.

Enrollment grew to about 1,000 when World War II broke out. It reached more than 3,500 in 1950 with the return of the veterans and grew steadily. When the baby boomers hit college age, the university&#x27;s enrollment topped 10,000. However, local enrollment decreased in the 1960s when Wright State University was established and Sinclair Community College was expanded, moving UD toward becoming a national university. In 2012, more than half of the undergraduates were from states other than Ohio. International enrollment has grown as well. In 2012 a record of more than 1,500 international students were enrolled.

=== Marianist tradition ===
The University of Dayton was founded by priests and brothers in the tradition of the Society of Mary and is one of three Marianist universities in the U.S. It is a member of the Association of Marianist Universities and the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.

Although the university is not pontifical in character, the academic program of the university&#x27;s International Marian Research Institute does have pontifical character and is affiliated with the Pontifical Theological Faculty Marianum in Rome.

Vowed Marianists governed the university until 1970 when the charter was amended and lay members joined the board of trustees. Vowed Marinists served as presidents through 2002, when Daniel J. Curran, became the university&#x27;s 18th president and first lay leader. Eric F. Spina, PhD succeeded Dr. Curran in 2016 as the 19th president of the university.

To sustain the Marianist identity and values of the university, Marianist Educational Associates were established in 2005 to educate lay leaders so the beliefs and traditions at the foundation of the Marianist educational philosophy could continue.

==Campus==

The University of Dayton&#x27;s campus is located on approximately on the southern border of the city of Dayton. It is divided into four sections: Historic Campus, Campus West, River Campus, and Arena Sports Complex. The campus includes 38 academic, research, athletic, and administrative buildings; five residence halls; 18 student apartment complexes; and 473 houses (347 of which are owned by the university).

===Historic campus===
At the center of campus are St. Mary&#x27;s Hall and the Immaculate Conception Chapel, whose blue cupola inspired the university&#x27;s logo. In its early years, St. Mary&#x27;s served as a dormitory and classroom; today, it holds the offices of the bursar, human resources, president, provost, and services for current students such as financial aid, registration, student employment, and veterans services.

St. Joseph Hall was built in 1884 as a residence hall. The interior was destroyed in a fire in 1987 and reopened in 1989. It houses the classrooms and offices for the social sciences and the university&#x27;s Fitz Center for Leadership in Community.

Chaminade Hall, built in 1904, is named for William Joseph Chaminade, the founder of the Society of Mary.

Kettering Labs is home to the School of Engineering. Named after engineer and inventor Eugene Kettering, it includes classrooms, labs, offices, a machine shop, a wind tunnel, and the Innovation Center.

The Jesse Philips Humanities Center was built in 1993 and named for former university trustee Jesse Philips. It houses academic departments including American studies, English, history, languages, philosophy, and religious studies. It contains 20 classrooms, two computer centers, an international language lab, and a 180-seat recital hall.

Miriam Hall is home to the School of Business Administration and contains team-teaching, labs and seminar classrooms, including the Davis Center for Portfolio Management, the Crotty Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership, and the Hanley Trading Center. Miriam Hall is named for Dayton philanthropist Miriam Rosenthal, who played an important role in fundraising for the university.

The Science Center (the joint name for Sherman Hall, Wohlleben Hall, and a connecting central atrium) is home to the math, biology, physics, chemistry, geology, and pre-medicine departments. This building includes classrooms, laboratories, offices, and auditoriums. Sherman and Wohlleben Halls were independent buildings until renovations in 2003 connected them with an atrium and study space.

Keller Hall opened in 1997 and is home to the University of Dayton School of Law. It has classrooms, offices, courtrooms, and a law library.

The John F. Kennedy Memorial Student Union (known as the Kennedy Union) is a popular gathering place for students. It houses a full-service dining facility, coffee shop, snack shop, and the Hangar—a games room with bowling lanes, pool tables, and video arcade. It also houses a copy center, travel agency, box office, meeting spaces, and the Boll Theatre.

The Central Mall is seven acres of green space at the heart of campus, surrounded by several academic and residential buildings. Renovation was completed in 2010.

The Roesch Library houses the university&#x27;s main library, the Marian Library (which has the world&#x27;s largest collection of materials on Mary, the mother of Jesus), and the Ryan C. Harris Learning Teaching Center that includes team meeting spaces, distance learning and a student-run coffee shop. The print and electronic collections in Roesch Library include more than 1.3 million books and 69,000 journals.

The RecPlex opened in 2006. The building&#x27;s amenities include aerobics and cardiovascular rooms, a climbing wall, courts for basketball, floor hockey, lacrosse, racquetball, tennis and volleyball; an eight-lane swimming pool, indoor track, weight room, locker room, and lounge.

The Frericks Center has a 5,000-seat gym and was once known as the Fieldhouse prior to the construction of the University of Dayton Arena. It is now also home to the university&#x27;s women&#x27;s volleyball team.

The Cronin Athletics Center is used by all 17 Dayton Flyer intercollegiate sports programs. It recently underwent a $2.375 million renovation for larger offices, team meeting rooms, and indoor practice space for basketball, football, track and field, tennis, soccer, baseball, and softball.

Stuart Field was updated in 2011 with a synthetic turf to accommodate intramural and club sports.

==Research==

The University of Dayton Research Institute has performed more than $2.5 billion in total sponsored research since its inception. Most of the research is done in engineering, either by 640 full-time researchers at the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI) or engineering faculty. More than 370 undergraduate and graduate students work alongside researchers.

Materials engineering accounts for most of the research within engineering, followed by electrical engineering. The university&#x27;s engineering research played a role in GE Aviation&#x27;s decision to locate the new Electrical Power Integrated Systems Research and Development Center (EPISCENTER) on the University of Dayton campus.

===Christmas on Campus===

Each year since 1964, usually on December 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, University of Dayton students have hosted about 1,000 Dayton school children, giving them gifts and escorting them through campus for games, dancing, singing, crafts, face-painting, and Santa Claus. The event is free and open to the public and includes a live Nativity scene, a reading on the birth of Jesus, and the lighting of a Christmas tree. The evening ends with hundreds of students attending a Mass in the Immaculate Conception Chapel.

Ellie Kurtz, director of the University of Dayton&#x27;s student union from 1964 to 1994, started Christmas on Campus as a way for students to celebrate Christmas before heading home for the winter break. &quot;One night I was preoccupied with a sense of disappointment that students would be leaving for Christmas vacation and would not be able to celebrate Christmas with their friends and the UD family,&quot;Kurtz said before her death in 2009, &quot;I imagined what a wonderful Christmas we could have if we could celebrate Christmas before the students went home for the holidays&quot;.

===Club and intramural sports===
In addition to varsity athletics, there are 37 club and 12 intramural sports. In January 2006, the university opened RecPlex, a $25 million sports and recreational facility for students of the university. The Princeton Review has the University of Dayton first on its latest &quot;Everybody Plays Intramural Sports&quot; list.

==Athletics==


The Dayton Flyers compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference in all sports except football, in which they compete in the Pioneer Football League. The Flyers&#x27; mascot is &quot;Rudy Flyer,&quot; a pun based on the university&#x27;s initials, &quot;U.D.&quot; Rudy is a barnstorming pilot who wears goggles and a leather pilot&#x27;s helmet. The nickname &quot;Flyers&quot; is a tribute to the Wright Brothers who began their careers and invented the airplane in Dayton. The fight song is &quot;Victory.&quot;

The university sponsors 16 sports: men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, baseball, football, softball, women&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s rowing, and women&#x27;s track. UD&#x27;s spirit group, the Red Scare, supports many of the Flyers athletics teams.

<text>Red Rocks Amphitheatre (also known colloquially as simply Red Rocks) is an open-air amphitheater in the western United States near Morrison, Colorado, approximately southwest of Denver. It is owned and operated by the city of Denver. In addition to several other large sandstone formations nearby, the venue is best recognized by its two massive monoliths, named &quot;Ship Rock&quot; and &quot;Creation Rock&quot;, as well as the smaller &quot;Stage Rock&quot;, which together flank its 9,525 capacity seating area and naturally form the amphitheater. While the venue is primarily known for hosting concerts and music festivals, other events of various types and sizes are held throughout the year.

In 1957, the American Institute of Architects selected Red Rocks to be Colorado&#x27;s entry at the National Gallery of Art for the AIA&#x27;s Centennial Exhibition. In 1999, after &quot;Pollstar&quot; magazine awarded Red Rocks the annual honor of being the best small outdoor venue for the eleventh time, the magazine changed the name of the award to the &quot;Red Rocks Award&quot; and removed Red Rocks from the running.

Construction began in October 2020 to replace the existing stage roof and expand the structure&#x27;s rigging capacity; the work was completed the following summer.

== History ==

The natural features surrounding the amphitheater were formed millions of years ago as part of the Fountain Formation, then lifted and tilted during a geological upheaval event called the Laramide Orogeny, the same time in which the nearby Garden of the Gods and Flatirons were formed. The characteristic reddish colors of the rock formations is the result of oxidized minerals. 

While the grounds were likely used by the Ute tribe in earlier times, an Army expedition led by Stephen Long rediscovered present-day Red Rocks in 1820. The prevalence of the nearby Colorado gold rush between 1858-1859 drew further interest from prospectors and new settlers along the Front Range. Originally named the &quot;Garden of the Angels&quot;, Marion Burts became the first recorded owner of the site in 1872. He sold it to Leonard H. Eicholtz, who in turn developed the property into a park in 1878. Nearly 30 years later, Eicholtz sold Red Rocks to famed magazine editor John Brisben Walker in 1906. 

The site was renamed to &quot;Garden of the Titans&quot; and further developed to incorporate a temporary platform for hosting concerts from. In addition to the platform, Walker also built the Mount Morrison Cable Incline funicular railway, which carried tourists from the lower area of the park up to the top of Mount Morrison. The incline operated for about five years beginning in 1909. In 1927, George Cranmer, Manager of Denver Parks, convinced the City of Denver to purchase the area of Red Rocks from Walker for $54,133 ($ today), officially adopting the title of &quot;Red Rocks&quot; Amphitheatre, a name it had been informally referred to since the area was settled. 

Cranmer then convinced Mayor Benjamin Stapleton to build upon the foundation laid by Walker. By enlisting the help of Denver architect Burnham F. Hoyt and Stanley E. Morse, along with labor and materials provided by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as part of the New Deal program, construction of the amphitheater began in 1936 and was formally dedicated on June 15, 1941, with a performance by Helen Jepson.

== Notable performances ==

Public, organizational and private performances have been held at Red Rocks for over a century. The earliest documented performance at the amphitheater was the &quot;Grand Opening of the Garden of the Titans&quot;, put on by publisher John Brisben Walker on May 31, 1906. Featuring Pietro Satriano and his 25-piece brass band, it was the formal opening of the natural amphitheater for use by the general public after Walker purchased it with the proceeds of his sale of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

The amphitheater&#x27;s largest-scale performance to date was the &quot;Feast of Lanterns&quot; on September 5, 1908. Commemorating the opening of the scenic road up nearby Mt. Falcon, it was patterned after the festival of Nagasaki, Japan, and featured four military bands and fireworks off Mt. Falcon, Mt. Morrison and two intermediate hills.

Renowned opera singer Mary Garden put Red Rocks on the world musical map with her performance on May 10, 1911. Having performed at many opera halls around the world, she pronounced Red Rocks the finest venue at which she had ever performed.

Upon the full construction of the amphitheater to its present form by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the venue was formally dedicated on June 15, 1941. It has held regular concert seasons almost every year since 1947. On July 23, 1948, Igor Stravinsky conducted the Denver Symphony at Red Rocks. In 2020 and 2021, it was shut down temporarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first performance of each season is the &quot;Easter Sunrise Service&quot;, a nondenominational service held on Easter Sunday of each year. In 1958, Van Cliburn played Red Rocks to a sold-out crowd.

The earliest notable rock performance at Red Rocks was by The Beatles on August 26, 1964, the only concert not sold out during their US-tour. Beatles drummer Ringo Starr later recalled, “I remember it was very high and the air was thin. They were giving us hits from oxygen canisters.” When Starr returned to Red Rocks with his All-Starr Band on June 28, 2000, he asked if anyone in the crowd had been at the Beatles concert thirty-six years earlier. On August 26, 2004, the East-Coast-based Beatles-tribute band 1964 was flown to Denver to re-enact the Beatles concert held at the site exactly forty years earlier. The first country and western show at Red Rocks was on August 29, 1965, headlined by Johnny Cash.

The unique setting has led to the venue&#x27;s becoming a favorite for many performers: Jimi Hendrix played at Red Rocks on September 1, 1968, along with Vanilla Fudge and Soft Machine. It was the first Red Rocks show booked by concert promoter Barry Fey. Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes performed there on August 14, 1969.

An incident during a performance by Jethro Tull on June 10, 1971, led to a five-year ban of rock concerts at Red Rocks. Approximately 1,000 people without tickets arrived at the sold-out show. Denver police directed the overflow, non-paying crowd to an area behind the theater, where they could hear the music but not see the band. The situation seemed satisfactory until some of the people without tickets attempted to enter the amphitheater by charging at, and breaking through, the police line. Some of those without tickets began lobbing rocks at the police, and the police responded by discharging tear gas at the gate-crashers. The wind carried the tear gas over the hill, into the paying crowd and onto the stage. Following the &quot;Riot at Red Rocks,&quot; Denver Mayor William H. McNichols Jr. banned rock concerts from the amphitheater. For the next five years, shows at Red Rocks were limited to softer acts, such as John Denver, Sonny &amp; Cher, The Carpenters, Pat Boone, Seals &amp; Crofts and Carole King. The ban on rock and roll was finally lifted through legal action taken by Barry Fey, who tried to book the band America at the venue in 1975. After being denied a permit by the city, Fey took the city to court, and the court ruled that the city had acted &quot;arbitrarily and capricious[ly]&quot; in banning rock concerts at Red Rocks. Starting in the summer of 1976, the rock bands were once again welcomed at the venue. Jethro Tull played Red Rocks again on June 7, 1988, August 12, 2008, and June 8, 2011.

On June 5, 1983, U2 performed during their War Tour, in front of only 4,400 in very inclement weather. The venue had been sold out, but the crowd size was affected by the weather, with attendees believing the show would be canceled. The show was not canceled because the band could not get their money back for the outlay on filming crews and equipment for the performance. Those who braved the weather and showed up were told personally by Bono, who came to the parking lot and into the crowd more than once, to ignore their seat assignments, and to move as forward as they wished to make the house seem full, since the show was being filmed for what became the group&#x27;s concert film &quot;U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;. The music video for &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday,” shown in heavy rotation on MTV, was also the fruit of the filming effort. Some songs from the show appear on the group&#x27;s 1983 live album &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;.

Depeche Mode performed at the amphitheater four times: July 1, 1986, July 11 and 12, 1990, during their World Violation Tour, and on August 27, 2009, during their &quot;Tour of the Universe&quot;, in front of a crowd of 8,679 people. The 2009 show was recorded for the group&#x27;s live albums project &quot;Recording the Universe&quot;.

Red Rocks was one of the favored venues for The Grateful Dead and the venue has become a traditional stop for many subsequent jam bands. In total the Grateful Dead played Red Rocks 20 times between 1978 and 1987. The performances on July 7, 1978, and July 8, 1978, were released as part of the &quot;July 1978: The Complete Recordings&quot;
box set, with July 8 having a stand alone release, &quot;Red Rocks: 7/8/78&quot;. The Grateful Dead held the record for most sold out performances at Red Rocks until 2015.

Widespread Panic holds the record for the most sold-out performances at Red Rocks, with 72 as of June 2024. Blues Traveler has played the venue every Fourth of July since 1993, except 1999 when lead singer and harmonica player John Popper was unable to play due to heart surgery. Phish were banned from performing at Red Rocks after they played four concerts there in August 1996. Fans of the band who showed up to the concerts without tickets were accused of starting a riot outside the amphitheater on the second night, and the nearby town of Morrison was unprepared to accommodate the size of the band&#x27;s following. Phish was not invited to perform at Red Rocks again until July 2009.

Geddy Lee of Rush said, &quot;It&#x27;s an amazing location...One of the most stunning concert venues in the United States... or anywhere. I would hazard a guess that it&#x27;s one of the most beautiful places in the world.&quot; Rush played Red Rocks on their R30 30th Anniversary, Snakes and Arrows and Time Machine tours.

Colorado musicians who have performed at Red Rocks include John Denver in 1973, Judy Collins in 1973, Big Head Todd and the Monsters in 1994, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (some members are from Denver) in 2002, The Fray in 2006, DeVotchKa in 2008, 3OH!3 in 2012, Pretty Lights in 2012, OneRepublic in 2013, The Lumineers in 2013, and Strawberry Runners in 2016. As of 2023, Colorado band The String Cheese Incident has played at Red Rocks over 50 times.

On August 7, 2000, the &quot;Film on the Rocks&quot; series started with a screening of &quot;Casablanca&quot;.

In 2014, after voters in Colorado legalized marijuana, the Colorado Symphony played a cannabis-themed &quot;Red Rocks on a High Note&quot; show there. In 2018, Yo-Yo Ma began his tour of Bach&#x27;s Cello Suites at Red Rocks.

On October 5, 2019, AJR played a sold-out show at the amphitheater for their Neotheater World Tour.

During the 2020 pandemic, Red Rocks hosted the Colorado Symphony Strings, which played sold-out Acoustic on the Rocks shows in July and August, following social-distancing guidelines.

In September 2020, virtual shows were streamed live. Despite Denver Arts &amp; Venues announcing the closure of all its venues (including Red Rocks) in September, in-person shows did occur. Other events included drive-in movies for mainstream films and the Denver Film Festival&#x27;s red carpet movies.

In 2021, Red Rocks Amphitheatre was named the top-grossing and most-attended concert venue of any size, anywhere in the world.

On August 9 and 10, 2022, &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone held a live concert alongside rock bands Primus, Ween and Rush at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, commemorating &quot;South Park&quot;″s 25th anniversary. Besides a few original songs from the supporting bands, the concert mainly consisted of Parker and Stone performing music from the series.

On June 21, 2023, the largest injury-inducing weather event in the venue&#x27;s history occurred. Before Louis Tomlinson was scheduled to perform, a hailstorm with apple sized hail injured over 90 people, including 7 who were hospitalized.

On October 8, 2023, Noah Kahan played a sold-out show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre as part of his Stick Season Tour. 

== Notable recordings ==

<text>Punsch (or &quot;punssi&quot; in Finnish) is a type of liqueur popular in Sweden and Finland. It is most frequently called &quot;Swedish Punsch&quot;, and while historical variations have also been called , , and , punsch should not be confused with the English term &quot;punch&quot;. It is made by the mixing of spirits (arrack, brandy or rum) with arrak tea (lemon and spices), sugar, and water, and was first brought to Sweden from Java in 1733. The spirit arrack is the base ingredient in most punsches, also imported into Europe by the Dutch from their colony in Batavia, Dutch East Indies. Punsch usually has 25% alcohol by volume (ABV) and 30% sugar.

While still made in Sweden by combining ingredients, since the later part of the 19th century it is frequently purchased as a bottled liqueur under various brand names. It is drunk both warmed and chilled.

==Etymology==
Originally, Swedish/Finnish punsch was a variant of punch, which became a popular drink all over Europe in the 18th century, having been introduced in Britain from India in the late 17th century. Some believe the word &quot;punch/punsch&quot; came from a loanword from Persian &quot;panj&quot;, meaning &quot;five&quot;, as punch was originally made with five ingredients: alcohol, sugar, lemon, water, and tea or spices. Others believe the word originates from the English &quot;puncheon&quot;, which was a volumetric description for certain sized barrels used to transport alcohol on ships. The English spelling of the word was in Sweden and Germany adapted to local spelling rules, thus becoming &quot;punsch&quot;. In Sweden, regular punch is also served, but is instead known as &quot;bål&quot; (bowl). Punsch became such a tradition in Sweden that it influenced the language: there are some 80 words in the Swedish dictionary derived from &quot;punsch&quot;.

==History of punsch==

The Swedish East India Company started to import arrack with the arrival of their ship &quot;Fredricus Rex Sueciae&quot; to Gothenburg in 1733. It quickly became popular, especially among the wealthy, who could afford the price of imported spirits and teas to make punsch. Later it spread through all levels of society, including students, the military, and fraternal orders, becoming a truly national drink.

An early recipe for &quot;punsch&quot; was written by Pehr Osbeck in the book he published with his fellow travellers Olof Torén and Carl Gustaf Ekeberg, &quot;A Voyage to China and the East Indies&quot; (1771), an English translation of the original Swedish publication of 1757: 
A testament to the widespread popularity of punsch or &quot;rack&quot; (arrack) are the songs of Swedish eighteenth century poet and composer Carl Michael Bellman. It is often mentioned in his three works &quot;Bacchi Tempel&quot; (1783), &quot;Fredmans epistlar&quot; (1790) and &quot;Fredmans sånger&quot; (1791) about a group of fictional characters, drunkards, bohemians and prostitutes in contemporary Stockholm (see for example song no. 48 or epistle no. 41). Many drinking songs from that period are about the consumption of punsch. Swedish entertainer Povel Ramel sang about punsch in the song &quot;Varför är där ingen is till punschen?&quot;

The high point of punsch consumption was during the late nineteenth century, when the Swedes started frequenting restaurants and loved to end their dinner with coffee and half a bottle of punsch on the table, placed in an ice bucket. The drinking of punsch was also popular at home, and outdoor porches were sometimes referred to as &quot;punschverandas&quot;, where the men drank punsch, told stories, and smoked cigars.

== Use in food and drink ==

Until the 1840s, punsch was typically served warm and created just before consumption: a sugarloaf was placed upright in a large bowl, hot water was poured over it to make the sugar dissolve, and arrack, unflavoured spirits and German Rhine wine were added. Still warm, the drink was then served in cups. Punsch is also used as a flavoring agent or to increase the alcohol content for glögg, the warmed Scandinavian mulled wine frequently associated with Christmas. On Thursdays, punsch is traditionally served warm as an accompaniment to Swedish yellow pea and pork soup (&quot;ärtsoppa&quot;) and pancakes. It may also be served warm at winter festivals and at student dinners.

In 1845 the wine importing company J. Cederlunds Söner started selling premixed punsch in bottles. This was quickly followed by several other manufacturers, including in northern Germany, and the habit of also drinking punsch as a chilled liqueur began to take hold.

Apart from being drunk neat, punsch is mixed into cocktails. Among the more prevalent are the Doctor cocktail (with rum &amp; lime), the Diki-Diki (with apple brandy &amp; grapefruit juice), and the &quot;Guldkant&quot; (or &quot;gold rim&quot;, made with equal parts punsch &amp; cognac). Trader Vic&#x27;s 1947 &quot;Bartender&#x27;s Guide&quot; includes the &quot;Turret Cocktail&quot; and its version of the Corpse Reviver No.2 with Swedish punsch. Other alcoholic drinks include the Boomerang cocktail, &quot;Greta Garbo&quot;, Malecon, and the Modernista.

Mixed also for wine cocktails, pre-prohibition era bartender Charles Mahoney mixed equal parts Rhine wine and punsch to make a &quot;Prefeldt Highball&quot;. Punsch is also added to sparkling wine to make a &quot;punsch royale&quot;.

Used as a flavoring syrup in desserts, it is a vital ingredient in the popular Swedish chocolate praline, known as &quot;punschpralin&quot;. It is also used in the pastry called &quot;punschrulle&quot;, and is associated with the Runeberg torte. Punsch ice cream is an available flavor in Sweden.

<text>Herman Ole Andreas Wold (25 December 1908 – 16 February 1992) was a Norwegian-born econometrician and statistician who had a long career in Sweden. Wold was known for his work in mathematical economics, in time series analysis, and in econometric statistics.

In mathematical statistics, Wold contributed the Cramér–Wold theorem characterizing the normal distribution and developed the Wold decomposition in time series analysis. In microeconomics, Wold advanced utility theory and the theory of consumer demand. In multivariate statistics, Wold contributed the methods of partial least squares ([[Herman Wold|PLS]]) and graphical models. Wold&#x27;s work on causal inference from observational studies was decades ahead of its time, according to Judea Pearl.

==Early life==
Herman Wold was born in Skien, southern Norway. He was the youngest in a family of six brothers and sisters. In 1912 the family moved to Sweden and became Swedish citizens. Herman&#x27;s father had a small fur and hide business.

==Scientific achievements==
Herman Wold had a long and productive career, spanning six decades.

===Studying with Harald Cramér===
In 1927 Wold enrolled at the University of Stockholm to study mathematics. It was an opportune time, for Harald Cramér had been appointed Professor of Actuarial Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics. Wold would later write, &quot;To belong to Cramér&#x27;s first group of students was good luck, an advantage that simply cannot be exaggerated.&quot;

After graduating in 1930 Wold worked for an insurance company; he also did work on mortality data with Cramér and later designed a tariff for the insurance companies. He started work on a PhD on stochastic processes with Cramér as supervisor. Away from the thesis Wold and Cramér did some joint work, their best known result being the Cramér–Wold theorem (1936).

===Time series and the Wold decomposition===

Wold&#x27;s thesis, &quot;A Study in the analysis of stationary time series,&quot; was an important contribution. The main result was the &quot;Wold decomposition&quot; by which a stationary series is expressed as a sum of a deterministic component and a stochastic component which can itself be expressed as an infinite moving average. Beyond this, the work brought together for the first time the work on individual processes by English statisticians, principally Udny Yule, and the theory of stationary stochastic processes created by Russian mathematicians, principally A. Ya. Khinchin. Wold&#x27;s results on univariate time series were generalized to multivariate time series by his student Peter Whittle.

The Wold decomposition and the related Wold&#x27;s theorem inspired Beurling&#x27;s factorization theorem in harmonic analysis and related work on invariant subspaces of linear operators.

===Theory of consumer demand===
In 1938 a government committee appointed Wold to do an econometric study of consumer demand in Sweden. The results were published in 1940. In parallel, he worked on the theory of demand. His book &quot;Demand Analysis&quot; (1952) brought together his work on the theory of demand, the theory of stochastic processes, the theory of regression and his work on Swedish data.

===Systems of simultaneous equations and causal inference===
In 1943 and 1944, Trygve Haavelmo put forward his ideas on the simultaneous equations model, arguing that systems of simultaneous equations should be central in econometric research. Wold noted some limitation of the maximum-likelihood approach favoured by Haavelmo and the Cowles Commission; Wold cautioned that the literature contained some exaggerated claims for the superiority of maximum-likelihood estimation.

In 1945 to 1965, Wold proposed and elaborated on his &quot;recursive causal chain&quot; model, which was more appropriate for many applications, according to Wold: For such &quot;recursive causal chain&quot; models, the least squares method was computationally efficient and enjoyed superior theoretical properties, which it lacked for general time-series models. Wold&#x27;s writings on causality and recursive-chain models have been recognized as scientific inventions by recent work on causality and graphical models in statistics, especially by Judea Pearl and Nanny Wermuth.

===Multivariate analysis and partial least squares===

At the end of his career, Wold turned away from econometric modelling and developed multivariate techniques for what he called &quot;soft&quot; modelling. Some of these methods were developed through interactions with his student K. G. Jöreskog, although the latter&#x27;s focus was primarily on maximum likelihood methods. His son Svante Wold applied these techniques in chemistry and developed the field of chemometrics.

==Appointments==
The story of Wold&#x27;s academic appointments is briefly told. In 1942 he became professor of statistics at Uppsala University and he stayed there until 1970. He then moved to Gothenburg, retiring from there in 1975.

In 1960 Wold became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was a member of the Prize Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel from 1968 to 1980.

<doc id="454837" wikidata="Q2157619" url="?curid=454837" title="Auriculotherapy">
<text>Auriculotherapy (also auricular therapy, ear acupuncture, and auriculoacupuncture) is a form of alternative medicine based on the idea that the ear is a micro system and an external organ, which reflects the entire body, represented on the auricle, the outer portion of the ear. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient are assumed to be treatable by stimulation of the surface of the ear exclusively. Similar mappings are used by several modalities, including the practices of reflexology and iridology. These mappings are not based on or supported by any medical or scientific evidence, and are therefore considered to be pseudoscience.

==History and development==
French neurologist Paul Nogier invented auriculotherapy in 1957. Nogier developed a phrenological method of projection of a fetal Homunculus on the ear and published what he called the &quot;Vascular Autonomic Signal&quot; which measured a change in the amplitude of the pulse. That mechanism would only produce a signal upon the introduction of new information to the electromagnetic field of the patient. Nogier cited a &#x27;principle of matching resonance&#x27; which he could use the vascular autonomic signal to detect the active points of the auricular microsystem.

Nogier&#x27;s Auricular acupuncture was introduced to China in 1958.

A variation of auriculotherapy called &quot;ear stapling&quot; involves the long-term insertion of a medical staple in the conchal bowl of the ear. Advocates variously claim that the procedure aids in losing weight, stopping smoking, and managing stress.

In 2001 Richard Niemtzow developed a procedure he called &quot;battlefield acupuncture&quot;, in an attempt to research more efficient relief for phantom limb pain and chronic pain for veterans. Battlefield Acupuncture involves placing gold aiguille semi-permanent needles at up to five sites in the ears. In 2018, the United States Department of Defense, the Veterans Center for Integrative Pain Management, and the Veterans Health Administration National Pain Management Program office completed a 3-year, $5.4 million acupuncture education and training program, which trained over 2800 providers in Battlefield Acupuncture. Retired U.S. Air Force flight surgeon Harriet Hall characterized the Department of Defense&#x27;s use of acupuncture and auriculotherapy as an embarrassing &quot;infiltration of quackery into military medicine&quot;, a waste of tax dollars, and a potential harm to patients.

==Nogier points==

The principles of auriculotherapy are contrary to known anatomy and physiology of the human body.
According to Nogier, the relevant structures include:
* Helix, the outer prominent rim of the auricle
* Antihelix, the elevated ridge anterior and parallel to the helix
* Triangular fossa, a triangular depression
* Scapha, the narrow curved depression between the helix and the antihelix
* Tragus, the small, curved flap in front of the auricle
* Antitragus, the small tubercle opposite to the tragus
* Concha, the hollow next to the ear canal

Nogier claims that various points located on the ear lobe are related to the head, and facial region, those on the scapha are related to the upper limbs, those on the antihelix and antihelix crura to the trunk and lower limbs and those in the concha are related to the internal organs.

==Chinese Auricular Acupuncture==

&quot;Auricular acupuncture therapy is an important part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which is ascribed to a kind of micro-needle system. It has been considered to be a valuable asset in the treasure house of Chinese medicine&quot;. There are many Chinese medical classics that have the inclusion of Auricular points to treat illness as defined by Chinese medical theory. But it was not until the French neurologist Paul Nogier systematically referenced and chartered the points of the ear in the late 1950s, was this form of treatment extensively researched, developed and practiced as its own modality in East Asia and in the West.

== Criticism ==
A controlled crossover study of 36 patients failed to find any difference in two experiments. The study concluded that auriculotherapy is not an effective therapeutic procedure for chronic pain.

The first experiment compared the effects of stimulation of auriculotherapy points versus control points. A second experiment compared the stimulation of these points with a placebo control of no-stimulation. Using the McGill Pain Questionnaire, pain was not decreased at the points compared to the controls. Patients&#x27; reports of pain relief after auriculotherapy are due to placebo effects.

Also, during electrical stimulation, patients sometimes reported new pain in an unrelated part of the body. These referred sensations reinforce the pain relief produced by the placebo effect and may be part of the reason why the belief in auriculotherapy persists.

<text>The Stoning of the Devil ( , &quot;throwing of the &quot;&quot; [place of pebbles]&quot;)
is part of the annual Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. During the ritual, Muslim pilgrims throw pebbles at three walls (formerly pillars), called &quot;jamarāt&quot;, in the city of Mina just east of Mecca. It is a symbolic reenactment of Ibrahim&#x27;s (or Abraham&#x27;s) hajj, where he stoned three pillars representing the Shaitan (or Satan), and Muslims&#x27; temptation to disobey the will of Allah. 

On Eid al-Adha (the 10th day of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah), pilgrims must strike the Big Jamarah or Al-Jamrah Al-Aqaba with seven pebbles. After the stoning is completed on the day of Eid, every pilgrim must cut or shave their hair. On each of the following two days, they must hit all three walls with seven pebbles each, going in order from east to west. Thus at least 21 pebbles are needed for the ritual; more stones would be needed if they failed to hit the pillar. It is permissible for the stones to fall into the designated areas of the pillars, and there is no need to throw them again if they land in the appropriate vicinity.

Some pilgrims stay at Mina for an additional day, in which case they must again stone each wall seven times. The pebbles used in the stoning are traditionally gathered at Muzdalifah, a plain southeast of Mina, on the night before the first throwing, but can also be collected at Mina.

==Replacement of the pillars==
Until 2004, the three &quot;jamarāt&quot; (singular: &quot;jamrah&quot;) were tall pillars. After the 2004 Hajj, Saudi authorities replaced the pillars with walls for safety; many people were accidentally throwing pebbles at people on the other side. To allow easier access to the &quot;jamarāt&quot;, a single-tiered pedestrian bridge called the Jamaraat Bridge was built around them, allowing pilgrims to throw stones from either ground level or from the bridge.

The &quot;&quot; are named (starting from the east):

* the first &#x27; (&#x27;), or the smallest &#x27; ( &#x27;),
* the middle &#x27; ( &#x27;), 
* the largest &#x27; ( &#x27;), or Jamrah of Aqaba ( &quot;&quot;).
Before 2004, the distance between the small and middle &#x27; was ; between the middle and large &#x27; it was .

==Historical and spiritual significance==

The ritual re-enacts Abraham&#x27;s pilgrimage to Mecca as explained by the Muslim historian al-Azraqi:

When he [Abraham] left Mina and was brought down to (the defile called) al-Aqaba, the Devil appeared to him at Stone-Heap of the Defile. Gabriel (Jibrayil) said to him: &quot;Pelt him!&quot; so Abraham threw seven stones at him so that he disappeared from him. Then he appeared to him at the Middle Stone-Heap. Gabriel said to him: &quot;Pelt him!&quot; so he pelted him with seven stones so that he disappeared from him. Then he appeared to him at the Little Stone-Heap. Gabriel said to him: &quot;Pelt him!&quot; so he pelted him with seven stones like the little stones for throwing with a sling. So the Devil withdrew from him.

All three &quot;jamarāt&quot; represent the devil: the first and largest represents his temptation of Abraham against sacrificing Ishmael (Ismāʿīl); the second represents the temptation of Abraham&#x27;s wife Hagar (Hājar) to induce her to stop him; the third represents his temptation of Ishmael to avoid being sacrificed. He was rebuked each time, and the throwing of the stones symbolizes those rebukes.

The stoning of the &quot;jamarāt&quot; also represents the repudiation of man&#x27;s self (&quot;&quot;, literally the &quot;internal despot&quot;) and the act of casting aside one&#x27;s low desires and wishes. As one Islamic theologian states:

==Incidents==
The Stoning of the Devil ritual is considered the most dangerous part of the pilgrimage, as sudden crowd movements on or near the Jamaraat Bridge can cause people to be crushed. On several occasions, thousands of participants have suffocated or been trampled to death in crowd crushes.

An important step in managing crowds is the recent replacement of the &quot;jamarāt&quot; pillars by walls to ease and speed up the stoning. The bridge has also been widened in recent years to accommodate the ever-growing number of pilgrims who perform the Hajj each year.

Crowd conditions are especially difficult during the final day of Hajj, which is the day pilgrims leave the valley of Mina and return to Mecca for the farewell &quot;Tawaf&quot; (the final circumambulation of the Kaaba). According to hadith, Muhammad&#x27;s last stoning was performed just after the noon prayer. Many scholars feel that the ritual can be done any time between noon and sunset on this day; however, many Muslims are taught that it should be done immediately after the noon prayer. This leads to people camping out until noon and rushing out then to do the stoning.

These two factors have been said to be most responsible for a stampede during the Hajj of 2006 which killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured at least 289 more. This was despite several attempts by the authorities to inform pilgrims about the permissibility of staggering their visits to the &quot;jamarāt&quot; as well as instructing them to leave their luggage at their tents. Adding to the confusion involved in the tragedy is the lack of co-operation on the part of pilgrims who do not leave the &quot;jamarāt&quot; area by the proper route, and therefore interfere with the movements of others who are arriving.

Another crush occurred on September 24, 2015, in Mina when at least 2,411 pilgrims were killed, a new Associated Press count shows, three times the number of deaths acknowledged by the kingdom three months later. The AP figures establish the Sept. 24 crush at Mina as the deadliest in the history of the annual pilgrimage. It occurred just weeks after a fatal crane collapse in Mecca.

Authorities have said the Mina crush and stampede occurred when two waves of pilgrims converged on a narrow road, suffocating or trampling to death those caught in the disaster.

Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, required of every able-bodied, financially capable, Muslim once in his or her life, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult. 

However, experts have said that the density of the crowds is very likely to lead to a crowd collapse in such circumstances. Ed Galea of the University of Greenwich said: &quot;If you’re designing an event to handle that crowd density, it&#x27;s inherently dangerous.&quot; He pointed out that the 500,000 people an hour who could cross the Jamarat bridge after it was widened in 2004 is equivalent to the largest-ever football crowd once every 24 minutes or the population of Germany in a week. One possible solution would be to spread the Hajj over a longer period.

<doc id="454839" wikidata="Q7338128" url="?curid=454839" title="Riverdale (Canadian TV series)">
<text>Riverdale is a Canadian prime time television soap opera, which ran for three seasons from 1997 to 2000. The series was set in the Toronto community of Riverdale, focusing on a variety of characters and their interactions in everyday life.

&quot;Riverdale&quot; was produced by Epitome Pictures in association with CBC Television. Originally inspired by the socially realistic style of British soaps such as &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, due to low early ratings it began introducing some more American-style soap opera elements, most notably in the expansion of Melissa DiMarco&#x27;s character, Irene Stavros, into an American-style soap vixen who dressed in tight clothing to accentuate her sex appeal.

Cast member Marion Gilsenan was battling cancer for much of her stint on the series. She won a Gemini Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Program or Series at the 14th Gemini Awards in 1999, several months after her death.

The series typically attracted low ratings in its initial prime-time airing, but performed more strongly on Sundays after a daytime repeat was added following &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. 94 half-hour episodes were produced.

<doc id="454843" wikidata="Q1403556" url="?curid=454843" title="Reference management software">
<text>Reference management software, citation management software, or bibliographic management software is software that stores a database of bibliographic records and produces bibliographic citations (references) for those records, needed in scholarly research. Once a record has been stored, it can be used time and again in generating bibliographies, such as lists of references in scholarly books and articles. Modern reference management applications can usually be integrated with word processors so that a reference list in one of the many different bibliographic formats required by publishers and scholarly journals is produced automatically as an article is written, reducing the risk that a cited source is not included in the reference list. They will also have a facility for importing bibliographic records from bibliographic databases.

Reference management software does not do the same job as a bibliographic database that tries to store records of publications published within a given scope such as a particular academic discipline or group of disciplines. Such bibliographic databases are large and have to be housed on major server installations. Reference management software collects a much smaller database, of the publications that have been used or are likely to be used by a particular researcher or group of researchers, and such a database can easily be stored on an individual&#x27;s personal computer.

Many reference management applications enable users to search bibliographic records in online bibliographic databases and library catalogs. An early communications protocol used to access library catalogs, and still in service at many libraries, is Z39.50, which predated the invention of the World Wide Web. Although Z39.50 is still in use, today most bibliographic databases are available as web sites that allow exporting selected bibliographic records in various bibliographic data formats that are imported by reference management software.

==Citation creators==
Citation creators or citation generators are online tools which facilitate the creation of works cited and bibliographies. Citation creators use web forms to take input and format the output according to guidelines and standards, such as the Modern Language Association&#x27;s MLA Style Manual, American Psychological Association&#x27;s APA style, The Chicago Manual of Style, or Turabian format. Some citation creators generate only run-time output, while others store the citation data for later use.

==In different academic fields==
===Research on software usage===
In 2013, a comparison of usage of EndNote, RefWorks, and Zotero among the legal scholars at the Oxford University Law Faculty was performed by survey. 0% of survey participants used RefWorks; 40% used Endnote; 17% used Zotero, mostly research students. The difficulty of using RefWorks, Endnote, and Zotero by Oxford legal scholars was estimated by the author as well. A comparison of these tools for legal scholars was made across several usage scenarios, including: installing and setting up OSCOLA citation style; building a personal legal bibliographic library and using extracting metadata from legal bibliographic databases; generating footnotes and bibliographies for academic publications; using and modifying OSCOLA citation style. In the same year, a survey conducted at the University of Turin found that knowledge of software was high but adoption was not, and the most known and used software was EndNote.

<text>An  () or ENS (in English: &quot;Institute of Advanced Education&quot;) is a type of elite publicly funded higher education institution in France. A portion of the student body, admitted via a highly-selective competitive examination process, are French civil servants and are known as &quot;normaliens&quot;. ENSes also offer master&#x27;s and PhD degrees, and can be compared to &quot;Institutes for Advanced Studies&quot;. They constitute the top level of research-training education in the French university system.

The history of &quot;écoles normales supérieures&quot; goes back to 30 October 1794 (&quot;9 brumaire an III&quot;), when &quot;École normale de l&#x27;an III&quot; was established during the French Revolution. The school was subsequently reestablished as &quot;pensionnat normal&quot; from 1808 to 1822, before being recreated in 1826 and taking the name of &quot;École normale&quot; in 1830. When institutes for primary teachers training called &quot;écoles normales&quot; were created in 1845, the word &quot;supérieure&quot; (meaning upper) was added to form the current name.

The Savary Law of 1984 restructured higher education in France and classified &quot;écoles normales supérieures&quot; within the category of &quot;établissements publics à caractère scientifique, culturel et professionnel&quot;.

As of January 2014, there are four existing ENSes: 
*, located in Paris 
*, located in Lyon
*, located in Gif-sur-Yvette, near Paris
*, located in Rennes

A twin institution has existed in Italy since its foundation by Napoleon Bonaparte, the &quot;Scuola Normale Superiore&quot; in Pisa.

== History ==

After the suppression of the Society of Jesus in France in 1762, a debate arose on how to replace their role in education. The idea of an &quot;école normale&quot;, a place to train teachers for the secondary schools, is already mentioned in a report on education made in 1768 by Rolland, president of the Parlement of Paris.

The first &quot;école normale&quot; was established by the National Convention in a decree dated 30 October 1794. Educated people from all parts of France were to be selected to attend the school and to subsequently return to found an &quot;école normale&quot; in their department for the education of primary school teachers. The &quot;école normale de l&#x27;an III&quot; had renowned teachers such as Laplace, Lagrange, and Berthollet but actually only functioned for four months, from 20 January 1795 to 19 May 1795 or in the then in use French Republican Calendar from 1er pluviose of year III until 30 floréal of year III.

In the decree of Napoleon of 17 March 1808, the institution was re-established as &quot;pensionnat normal&quot;. The candidates most promising for administration and education roles were admitted through a competitive examination. The students could attend courses at Collège de France, Muséum d&#x27;histoire naturelle or École polytechnique. At &quot;école normale&quot;, they received support from tutors for revising, laboratory experiments and teaching the art of teaching.

In 1880, Camille Sée established secondary education for girls. Subsequently, a law dated 29 July 1881 founded the &quot;École normale supérieure de jeunes filles&quot; located in Sèvres.

Jules Ferry got a law passed on 9 August 1879 in order to force each department to establish and fund an institution to train primary school teachers for each gender (&quot;école normale de garçons&quot; and &quot;école normale de filles&quot;). In order to train the teaching body of these schools, so-called &quot;écoles normales supérieures de l’enseignement primaire&quot; were needed. A decree dated 13 July 1880 set up the one for young women in Fontenay-aux-Roses, and later in March 1882 the male equivalent opened in Saint-Cloud.

Starting in 1891, a section for teacher training named &quot;sections normales&quot; was established in the &quot;École des Arts et métiers&quot; of Châlons-sur-Marne (decree of 11 June 1891) and in the &quot;École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Paris&quot; (decree of 21 July 1894). A decree published on 15 June 1899 organized &quot;sections normales&quot; for women. These &quot;sections normales&quot; were grouped together in 1912 into a single school which was named &quot;École normale supérieure de l&#x27;enseignement technique&quot; in 1934.

==Academic profile==
The &quot;École normale supérieure&quot; are a specific type of &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;, French institutions of higher education separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies than public universities in France, and many of their programs are taught in English. While most &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are more expensive than French universities, the &quot;École normale supérieure&quot; charges the same tuition fees: €243 annually at master&#x27;s degree in 2021–2022. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. Degrees from &quot;École normale supérieure&quot; are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) (). Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

The competitive entrance exams for admission to the ENSs are extremely selective. They recruit mainly from scientific and humanities &quot;Prépas&quot;, even though a small number of their students (fewer than 10 each year) are recruited separately on the basis of highly competitive exams. The students from France and other European Union countries recruited after a Classe préparatoire are considered civil servants in training, and as such paid a monthly salary, in exchange for an agreement to serve France for 10 years, including those of their studies.

The École normale supérieure located in Paris is nicknamed &quot;Ulm&quot; from its address &quot;rue d&#x27;Ulm&quot; (Ulm Street). It teaches sciences and humanities. École normale supérieure de Lyon in Lyon also teaches sciences and humanities. École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay located in Cachan, a suburb of Paris and École normale supérieure de Rennes located near Rennes teaches in 5 departements, which are : mechatronics, mathematics, informatics, sport sciences, earth sciences and law-economics-management.

Until recently and unlike most of the other &quot;grandes écoles&quot;, the &quot;écoles normales supérieures&quot; did not award any specific diplomas (students who had completed the curriculum they had agreed to with the office of the Dean upon arrival were simply entitled to be known as &quot;ENS Alumni&quot; or &quot;Normaliens&quot;), but they encourage their students to obtain university diplomas in partner institutions whilst providing extra classes and support. Many ENS students obtain more than one university diploma.

According to a calculation published in 2016 by Nature journal, the ENS Paris is the institution which, in proportion to the number of its alumni, has formed the greatest number of Nobel Prizes (0.001 35 &quot;per capita&quot;) in the world, which allows it to get ahead of the prestigious California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Harvard University (respectively 0.000 67 and 0.000 32 per capita).

<text>The Atrebates (Gaulish: *&quot;Atrebatis&quot;, &#x27;dwellers, land-owners, possessors of the soil&#x27;) were a Belgic tribe of the Iron Age and the Roman period, originally dwelling in the Artois region.

After the tribes of Gallia Belgica were defeated by Caesar in 57 BC, 4,000 Atrebates participated in the Battle of Alesia in 53, led by their chief Commius. They revolted again in 51 BC, after which they maintained a friendly relationship with Rome, as Commius received sovereignty over the neighbouring Morini. The quality of their woollens is still mentioned in 301 AD by Diocletian&#x27;s Price Edict.

An offshoot of the Belgic tribe probably entered Britain before 54 BC, where it was successively ruled by kings Commius, Tincommius, Eppillus and Verica. After 43 AD, only parts of the area were still controlled by king Claudius Cogidubnus, after which they fell under Roman power.

== Name ==
They are mentioned as &quot;Atrebates&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Pliny (1st c. AD), &quot;Atrebátioi&quot; (Ἀτρεβάτιοι) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD), &quot;Atribátioi&quot; (Ἀτριβάτιοι) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD), &quot;Atrébas&quot; (Ἀτρέβας) by Cassius Dio (3rd c. AD), and as &quot;Atrabatis&quot; in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (5th c. AD).

The ethnonym &quot;Atrebates&quot; is a latinized form of the Gaulish *&quot;Atrebatis&quot; ( &quot;Atrebas&quot;), which literally means &#x27;dwellers, land-owners, possessors of the soil&#x27;. It derives from the Proto-Celtic stem &quot;*attreb-&quot; (&#x27;settlement&#x27;) attached to the suffix &quot;-atis&quot; (&#x27;belonging to&#x27;), the former descending, as a result of an assimilation from an earlier *&quot;ad-treb&quot;-, from the Proto-Indo-European root for &#x27;settlement&#x27;, &quot;*treb-&quot; (cf. Osc. &quot;trííbúm&quot;, Germ. &quot;*Þurpa&quot;, Lith. &quot;trobà&quot; &#x27;house&#x27;). The ethnic name is cognate with the Old Irish &quot;ad-treba&quot; (&#x27;he dwells, cultivates&#x27;) and &quot;attrab&quot; (&#x27;possession, the act of occupying, a dwelling&#x27;), the Modern Irish &quot;áitreabhach&quot; (&#x27;inhabitant&#x27;), and the Middle Welsh &quot;athref&quot; (&#x27;dwelling-place, abode&#x27;).

The city of Arras, attested ca. 400 AD as &quot;civitas Atrabatum&quot; (&#x27;civitas of the Atrebates&#x27;; &quot;Atrebatis&quot; in 881, &quot;Arras&quot; in 1137), the region of Artois, attested in 799 as &quot;pago Atratinse&quot; (&#x27;pagus of the Abrates&#x27;; &quot;Atrebatense castrum&quot; in 899, later &quot;Arteis&quot;), and the , attested ca. 1050 as &quot;Atravasia silva&quot; (&#x27;forest of the Atrebates&#x27;; &quot;Arwasia&quot; in 1202), are all named after the Belgic tribe.

== Geography ==
=== Territory ===
The Belgic Atrebates dwelled in the present-day region of Artois, in the catchment area of the Scarpe river. They commanded two hill forts: a large and central one near Arras, and a frontier one on the Escaut river. The Atrebates were separated from the Ambiani by the Canche river.

In the mid-first century BC, an offshoot of the tribe lived in Britain, where they occupied a region stretching between the Thames, the Test, and West Sussex.

=== Settlements ===
During the Roman period, their centre was transferred from the hill-fort of Etrun to Nemetocennae (present-day Arras), on an important road junction. The name &quot;Nemetocennae&quot; means in Gaulish either &#x27;far&#x27; or &#x27;born&#x27; &#x27;from the sacred wood, the sanctuary&#x27;, stemming from the root &quot;nemet(o)-&quot; (&#x27;sacred wood&#x27; &gt; &#x27;sanctuary&#x27;) attached to the suffix -&quot;cenna&quot; (&#x27;far&#x27;) or, more likely, to a deformed suffix -&quot;genna&quot; (&#x27;born from&#x27;). It is later attested as &quot;Metacon&quot; by Ptolemy (ca. 170 AD), and as &quot;Nemetacum&quot; (ca. 300 AD) or &quot;Nemetaco&quot; (365), with the same root attached to the Gaulish suffix &quot;-acos&quot;.

Before 54 BC, an offshoot of the Gallic tribe probably settled in Britain. After the Roman invasion of Britain, three &quot;civitates&quot; were created in the late 1st c. BC: one of the Atrebates, with a capital in Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester); one of the Belgae with its capital at Venta Belgarum (Winchester); and one of the Reg(i)ni, with a capital at Noviomagus Reginorum (Chichester).

== History ==
===Gaul===
In 57 BC, they were part of a Belgic military alliance in response to Julius Caesar&#x27;s conquests elsewhere in Gaul, contributing 15,000 men. Caesar took this build-up as a threat and marched against it, but the Belgae had the advantage of position and the result was a stand-off. When no battle was forthcoming, the Belgic alliance broke up, determining to gather to defend whichever tribe Caesar attacked. Caesar subsequently marched against several tribes and achieved their submission.

The Atrebates then joined with the Nervii and Viromandui and attacked Caesar at the battle of the Sabis, but were there defeated. After thus conquering the Atrebates, Caesar appointed one of their countrymen, Commius, as their king. Commius was involved in Caesar&#x27;s two expeditions to Britain in 55 and 54 BC and negotiated the surrender of Cassivellaunus. In return for his loyalty, he was also given authority over the Morini. However, he later turned against the Romans and joined in the revolt led by Vercingetorix in 52 BC. After Vercingetorix&#x27;s defeat at the Siege of Alesia, Commius had further confrontations with the Romans, negotiated a truce with Mark Antony, and ended up fleeing to Britain with a group of followers. However, he appears to have retained some influence in Gaul: coins of post-conquest date have been found stamped with his name, paired with either Garmanos or Carsicios, who may have been his sons or regents.

===Britain===
Commius soon established himself as king of the British Atrebates, a kingdom he may have founded. Their territory comprised modern Hampshire, West Sussex and Berkshire, centred on the capital Calleva Atrebatum (modern Silchester). They were bordered to the north by the Dobunni and Catuvellauni; to the east by the Regni; and to the south by the Belgae.

The settlement of the Atrebates in Britain was not a mass population movement. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe argues that they &quot;seem to have comprised a series of indigenous tribes, possibly with some intrusive Belgic element, given initial coherence by Commius&quot;. It is possible that the name &quot;Atrebates&quot;, as with many &quot;tribal&quot; names in this period, referred only to the ruling house or dynasty and not to an ethnic group; Commius and his followers, after arriving in Britain, may have established a power-base and gradually expanded their sphere of influence, creating what was in effect a proto-state. However, during Caesar&#x27;s first expedition to Britain in 55 BC, after the Roman cavalry had been unable to cross the Channel, Commius was able to provide a small group of horsemen from his people, suggesting that he may have already had kin in Britain at that time. After this time, the Atrebates were recognized as a client kingdom of Rome.

Coins stamped with Commius&#x27;s name were issued from Calleva from ca. 30 BC to 20 BC. Some coins are stamped &quot;COM COMMIOS&quot;: interpreting this as &quot;Commius son of Commius&quot;, and considering the length of his apparent &quot;floruit&quot;, some have concluded that there were two kings, father and son, of the same name.

Three later kings of the British Atrebates name themselves on their coins as sons of Commius: Tincomarus, Eppillus and Verica. Tincomarus seems to have ruled jointly with his father from about 25 BC until Commius&#x27;s death in about 20 BC. After that, Tincomarus ruled the northern part of the kingdom from Calleva, while Eppillus ruled the southern half from Noviomagus (Chichester). Numismatic and other archeological evidence suggests that Tincomarus took a more pro-Roman stance than his father, and John Creighton argues from the imagery on his coins that he was brought up as an &quot;obses&quot; (diplomatic hostage) in Rome under Augustus.

Augustus&#x27;s &quot;Res Gestae&quot; mentions two British kings presenting themselves to him as supplicants, probably ca. 7 AD. The passage is damaged, but one is probably Tincomarus (the other is Dubnovellaunus, of either the Trinovantes or the Cantiaci). It appears Tincomarus was ousted by his brother, and from this point Eppillus&#x27;s coins are marked &quot;Rex&quot;, indicating that he was recognised as king by Rome.

In about 15, Eppillus was succeeded by Verica (at about the same time, a king by the name of Eppillus appears as ruler of the Cantiaci in Kent). But Verica&#x27;s kingdom was being pressed by the expansion of the Catuvellauni under Cunobelinus. Calleva fell to Cunobelinus&#x27;s brother Epaticcus by about 25. Verica regained some territory following Epaticcus&#x27;s death in about 35, but Cunobelinus&#x27;s son Caratacus took over the campaign and by the early 40s the Atrebates were conquered. Verica fled to Rome, giving the new emperor Claudius a pretext for the Roman conquest of Britain.

After the Roman conquest, part of the Atrebates&#x27; lands were organized into the pro-Roman kingdom of the Regni under Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus, who may have been Verica&#x27;s son. The tribal territory was later organised as the &quot;civitates&quot; (administrative districts within a Roman province) of the Atrebates, Regni and possibly the Belgae.

<text>The Cantiaci or Cantii were an Iron Age Celtic people living in Britain before the Roman conquest, and gave their name to a &quot;civitas&quot; of Roman Britain. They lived in the area now called Kent, in south-eastern England. Their capital was &quot;Durovernum Cantiacorum&quot;, now Canterbury.

They were bordered by the Regni to the west, and the Catuvellauni to the north.

Julius Caesar landed in Cantium in 55 and 54 BCE, the first Roman expeditions to Britain. He recounts in his &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; v. 14:

==Rulers==

===Pre-Roman Iron Age===
Julius Caesar named five Celtic tribes inhabiting the land that would become the &quot;heartland of the Catuvellauni&quot;: the Ancalites, the Bibroci, the Cassi, the Cenimagni, and the Segontiaci, each with their own &quot;king&quot; or chieftain. He found their way of life to be very similar to their cousins in Gaul with whom they were close – the invasion of Britain may have been triggered by the Britons&#x27; supply of arms to the Gauls, who were being subjugated by the Romans.

Caesar mentions four kings, Segovax, Carvilius, Cingetorix, and Taximagulus, who held power in Cantium at the time of his second expedition in 54 BCE. The British leader Cassivellaunus, besieged in his stronghold north of the Thames, sent a message to these four kings to attack the Roman naval camp as a distraction. The attack failed, a chieftain called Lugotorix was captured, and Cassivellaunus was forced to seek terms.

In the century between Caesar&#x27;s expeditions and the conquest under Claudius (starting in 43 CE), kings in Britain began to issue coins stamped with their names. The following kings of the Cantiaci are known:

*Dubnovellaunus: May have been an ally or sub-king of Tasciovanus of the Catuvellauni, or a son of Addedomarus of the Trinovantes; presented himself as a supplicant to Augustus  7 BCE.
*Vosenius, ruled until c. 15 CE.
*Eppillus, originally king of the Atrebates: Coins indicate he became king of the Cantiaci c. 15 CE, at the same time as his brother Verica became king of the Atrebates.
*Cunobelinus, king of the Catuvellauni: Expanded his influence into Cantiaci territory.
*Adminius, son of Cunobelinus: Seems to have ruled on his father&#x27;s behalf, beginning c. 30 CE. Suetonius tells us he was exiled by Cunobelinus c. 40 CE, leading to Caligula&#x27;s aborted invasion of Britain.
*Anarevitos, known only from a coin discovered in 2010, probably a descendant of Eppillus and ruling c. 10 BCE – 20 CE.

===Sub-Roman period===
According to Nennius, Gwrangon was King of Kent in the time of Vortigern, until Vortigern took away the kingdom and gave it to Hengist; but Nennius is regarded as an untrustworthy source, and &quot;Gwrangon seems to have been transported by the story-teller into Kent from Gwent&quot; and &quot;is turned into an imaginary King of Kent, secretly disposed of his realm in favour of Hengist, whose daughter Vortigern wished to marry&quot;.

<text>The National Policy was a Canadian economic program introduced by John A. Macdonald&#x27;s Conservative Party in 1876. After Macdonald led the Conservatives to victory in the 1878 Canadian federal election, he began implementing his policy in 1879. The protective policy had shown positive responses in the economy with new industries flourishing Canada&#x27;s economy in the 1880s. John A. Macdonald combined three elements as a strategy for the post-Confederation economy. First, he called for high tariffs on imported manufactured items to protect the manufacturing industry. Second, he called for a massive expansion of physical infrastructure, such as roads and railroads. Finally, enabled and supported by the former two, he promoted population growth (particularly in western Canada), the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the fostering of immigration to Western Canada. Macdonald campaigned on the policy in the 1878 election, and defeated the Liberal Party, which supported free trade. It lasted from 1879 until sometime in the early 1950s.

==Terminology and usage==
The term &quot;National Policy&quot; originally aimed in aiming Canada to create a true country with a national economy. Macdonald figured that, while the political framework had been created in 1867, the economy would only last as long as the election lasted. To maintain a permanent strong national economy for the Confederation, Macdonald needed to engrave these factors for the future of the economy. This means the future was relied upon Canada&#x27;s development towards the West. Without east-west development, the Americans would over rule the west, taking away Canada&#x27;s peace and things that many people, and society. Over time, the term became associated with the entire Tory platform for developing the economy, especially increased immigration to Western Canada and the development of the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s transcontinental line. However, the National Policy also had hidden consequences for the economy of Canada. A barrier was created over the acceptance of products and goods that were allowed to pass into Canada.

==Key policies==
John A. Macdonald, previously the inaugural Prime Minister of Canada from 1867 until he resigned in 1873, returned to power in 1878 after his electoral victory that year, which enabled him to implement the National Policy. The policy had three-parts which would improve and expand Canada&#x27;s future, including:

===Promoting Canadian industries and manufacturers===
John Macdonald influenced Canadians to buy Canadian products to promote Canada&#x27;s economy. The problems were that the railways were easily importing goods and products from the United States that were much cheaper than Canadian-made goods. Macdonald proposed to put tax or tariffs on American imported goods and products.

Macdonald hoped that by creating a strong manufacturing base in Canada, the nation would become more secure and less reliant on the United States. He was also closely linked to the Montreal and Toronto business interests that would benefit from such a policy, and they played an important role in keeping the Tories in office until 1896.

Despite a brief experiment with free trade in the Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty before Confederation, the Americans were intent on pursuing a strongly protectionist policy, with tariffs higher than Canada imposed under the National Policy.

With such high American tariffs, Canadian firms could not compete in the United States, but American firms could enter Canada. Canadian producers were particularly hurt by American producers dumping surplus goods in Canada to avoid lowering prices in the United States. Tariffs were put on goods coming into Canada, which made American goods more expensive.

The policy quickly became one of the most central aspects of Canadian politics, and it played an important role in keeping the Tories in power until 1896, when Wilfrid Laurier and the Liberals campaigned on a promise to keep the National Policy in place. While many Liberals still supported free trade, the National Policy was too popular in Ontario and Quebec for it to end. When the Liberals campaigned on free trade in the 1911 election, they lost the election.

=== Imperial Preference ===
In 1897, the National Policy came to incorporate imperial preference, i.e. preferential tariff rates for imports from Britain. Initially, tariffs were reduced by one-eighth for imports from Britain, rising to one-quarter in 1898 and one-third in 1900. The Liberals, under Laurier, found imperial preference a convenient vehicle for reducing tariffs, as it appealed to the Empire-mindedness of Conservatives. Canadian imperial preference proved very effective. Keay and Varian have estimated that, within just a few years, Canadian imperial preference had the effect of doubling the value of imports from Britain, relative to the value of imports from Britain in the absence of the policy.

===Completing the National Railway===
When British Columbia joined the Confederation, the Canadian government promised a railway system to connect British Columbia with the east of Canada. Macdonald promised the railway to facilitate the transport of goods and services from the west to the east of Canada.

===Settling the West===
Macdonald made a promise to improve the farming industries in the west. This action was to highlight the west as the main producer for agriculture production in Canada.

===High tariffs===
John A. Macdonald&#x27;s national policy became a huge public issue once the Liberal government led by Alexander Mackenzie failed to raise the budget on tariffs in 1876. Once Macdonald came back into power in 1878, a higher tariff was introduced in the budget of Canada and business. The purpose of high tariffs were solemnly for the expansion of the base of Canadian economy and to project a more confident country for development in Canada. Tariffs were raised for goods and services on a majority of manufacturing goods that were made outside of Canada. The raise of tariffs on foreign manufactured goods was to protect Canadian made products and Canadian manufacturers.

===Unpopularity in the west===
Although the policy was popular in central Canada, it was extremely unpopular in western Canada. This opposition to the National Policy played an important role in the rise of the Progressive Party of Canada in the 1920s. In its platform, the &quot;New National Policy&quot;, it advocated free trade.

==Dismantled by Liberals==
The National Policy was slowly dismantled under the many years of Liberal rule under William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent. At the same time, the United States was lowering its tariffs. Economic integration surged during World War II, and in 1965 the automobile industry in the two nations became fully integrated. However, complete free trade was not achieved until 1988 with the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement brought in by Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government.

==Assessment==
The assessment of the National Policy is mixed. In general, economists argue that it increased prices and lowered Canada&#x27;s efficiency and ability to compete in the world. By not becoming merged into the larger, more efficient American economy, Canada built too many monopolistic firms and too many small inefficient factories with high prices for consumers. Historians tend to see the policy in a more positive light by viewing it as a necessary expense to create a unified nation independent of the United States. There was, however, a boon to the citizens as there was no income tax, making the slightly higher price of manufactured goods easier to bear.

After Wilfrid Laurier led the Liberal Party to power in the 1896 election, the Liberals adapted to this governing system and to the principles of the National Policy. Tariffs stayed at high rates. It was only under the Liberal governments of William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent beginning in the 1920s that protectionist tariffs rates began to be cut.

Eden and Molot (1993) argue that there have been three national policies in Canada: the &quot;National Policy&quot; of defensive expansionism, 1867–1940; compensatory liberalism, 1941–81; and market liberalism, starting in 1982. The defensive expansion phase relied on the tariff, railway construction, and land settlement to build the country. The second national policy combined a commitment to the GATT system, Keynesian macroeconomic policies, and the construction of a domestic social welfare net. Current national policy relies on Canada-US free trade and NAFTA free trade, market-based policies, and fiscal restraint. They argue for a fourth policy called &quot;strategic integration.&quot; It would consist of free trade, both external and internal; the building of a national telecommunications infrastructure based on the development and diffusion of information technologies; and human capital development.

<doc id="454859" wikidata="Q559011" url="?curid=454859" title="Arado Ar 240">
<text>The Arado Ar 240 was a German twin-engine, multi-role heavy fighter aircraft, developed for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II by Arado Flugzeugwerke. Its first flight was on 10 May 1940, but problems with the design hampered development, and it remained only marginally stable throughout the prototype phase. The project was eventually cancelled, with the existing airframes used for a variety of test purposes.

==Design and development==
The Ar 240 came about as the response to a 1938 request for a much more capable second-generation heavy fighter to replace the Messerschmitt Bf 110, which was becoming outdated. Both Arado and Messerschmitt responded. Messerschmitt&#x27;s response, the Me 210, was a totally new design, but thanks to Messerschmitt&#x27;s experience with the &quot;Zerstörer&quot; (&quot;Destroyer&quot;) concept, it would be able to enter service quickly. Arado&#x27;s design was considerably more ambitious for the smaller firm, a dream project of Arado&#x27;s chief designer, Walter Blume, since the mid-1930s. While it would take some time before deliveries of the Arado design could begin, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) was nevertheless interested enough to order prototypes of both designs.

Prior to this point, Arado had invested heavily in several lines of basic research. One was the development of the &quot;Arado travelling flap&quot; which offered excellent low-speed lift performance. Another was ongoing work in the design and construction of pressurized cockpits, which dramatically lowered pilot fatigue for any flight above about 4,500 m (14,760 ft). Finally, they had also invested in a technically advanced remote-control defensive gun system, which they had been experimenting with for several years. The system used a gunsight located in the rear cockpit, operated by the navigator/gunner, which had optics on both the top and bottom of the aircraft, allowing aim in any direction. The gunsight was hydraulically connected to well-streamlined pancake-shaped, remotely-operated turrets on the top and bottom of the aircraft. For the Ar 240 design, the Arado engineers combined all this research into a single airframe.

For outright performance, they used as small a wing as reasonable, thereby lowering parasite drag (at the expense of greater lift-induced drag). Normally this would make the plane have &quot;impossibly high&quot; landing speeds, but this was offset by the use of a huge travelling flap and leading edge slats for high low-speed lift. When the flaps were extended, the upper portion of the ailerons would remain in place while the lower portion extended rearward, essentially increasing the wing area.
The Daimler-Benz DB 601 inline engines were conventionally installed and equipped with three-blade, fully adjustable propellers. The radiators were somewhat unusual however, quite similar to those fitted to the Junkers Ju 88 which pioneered them - but much more closely resembling the intended installation of the radiators intended for the Junkers Ju 288, when powered by its intended multibank Junkers Jumo 222 liquid-cooled 24-cylinder engines - for both types, consisting of an annular block located in front of each engine, but with the Ar 240 partially covering each of them with an oversized, ducted flow-through propeller spinner forward of each radiator unit, with air entering through a large hole in the front of the spinner and exiting out of the cowl flaps, as the Jumo 222-powered Ju 288 design was intended to have. As with the Jumo inline-powered versions of the Ju 88, this made the plane look as if it were mounting a radial engine, and the Ar 240, like later Jumo inline-powered fighter aircraft from the Focke-Wulf firm (the Fw 190D, Ta 152 and twin-engined Ta 154) also benefitted from the simpler setup of an annular radiator just forward of the engine.

The fuel cells in the wings were provided with a newly developed self-sealing system that used thinner tank liners, allowing for more fuel storage. The liners could not be easily removed as they stuck to the outer surface of the tank, so in order to service them, the wing panelling had to be removable. This led to a complex system for providing skinning stiff enough to be handled in the field, complicating construction and driving up weight.

As with all German multi-use aircraft designs of the era, the aircraft was required to be a credible dive bomber. The thick wing panelling was not suitable for piercing for conventional dive brakes, so a &quot;petal&quot;-type brake was installed at the extreme rear of the fuselage — appearing much like what had been trialled with the Dornier Do 217 — which, unlike the Do 217&#x27;s vertically-opening &quot;petals&quot;, opened to the sides instead when activated. When closed the brake looked like a stinger, extending beyond the horizontal stabilizer and twin fins.

Finally, the cockpit was fully pressurized. This would not have been easy if the armament had to be hand-operated by the gunner, as it would have required the guns to penetrate the rear of the cockpit canopy. However, the remote control system allowed them to be located in turrets in the unpressurized rear of the fuselage.

All of this added weight, and combined with the small wing, led to a very high wing loading of 330 kg/m2 (221 lb/ft2), compared to an average of about a 100 for a single-seat fighter.

==Operational history==

===Testing and evaluation===
Technical specifications were first published in October 1938, followed by detailed plans later that year. In May 1939, the RLM ordered a batch of six prototypes. The first Ar 240 V1 prototype, DD+QL, took to the air on 25 June 1940, and immediately proved to have poor handling in all axes, also tending to overheat during taxiing.

The handling was thought to be the result of the ailerons being too small, given the thick wing, so the second prototype was modified to have larger ones, as well as additional vertical fin area on the dive brakes to reduce yaw. In addition, small radiators were added to the landing gear legs to improve cooling at low speeds, when the gear would normally be opened. Ar 240 V2, KK+CD, first flew on 6 April 1941, and spent most of its life at the factory in an experimental role.

Ar 240 V3 followed, the first to be equipped with the FA 9 rear-firing armament system, developed jointly by Arado and DVL, armed with a 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 81Z machine gun. Ar 240 V4 was the first to include an operational dive brake, and flew on 19 June 1941. Ar 240 V5 and the V6 followed in December and January, including the upgraded FA 13 system, using two 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns in place of the MG 81Z for a considerable boost in firepower. Ar 240 V7 and V8 acted as prototypes for the planned Ar 240B, which was to use two Daimler Benz DB 605As, while Ar 240 V9, V10, and V11, and V12 served as prototypes of the Ar 240C.

The Ar 240&#x27;s excellent performance quickly led to the V3, V5 and V6 being stripped of their armament, including the defensive guns, and used as reconnaissance aircraft over England, where no other two-seater could venture by 1942. The five AGO Flugzeugwerke built Ar 240A-0 saw operational service in 1943. JG 5 &#x27;Eismeer&#x27;, based in Finland, received two, 1. and 3.(F)/100 on the Eastern Front (World War II) received one each and 1.(F)/123 in Italy received one.

==Variants==
;Ar 240A-0: Four preproduction aircraft.
;Ar 240B: Proposed version
;Ar 240C-1: Heavy fighter version.
;Ar 240C-2: Night fighter version.
;Ar 240C-3: Light bomber version.
;Ar 240C-4: High-altitude reconnaissance version. The project was abandoned in favour of the Ar 440.
;Ar 440: Ar 240 V10 was earmarked as the Ar 440 prototype; second prototype not built. Improved variant with the fuselage stretched by 0.9m (35.5 in) and powered by the 1,900 hp (1,417 kW) DB 603G, the production aircraft would have had two 2,000 hp (1,491 kW) DB 627A/B engines. Planned armament was two 13mm MG 131s, three 20mm MG 151s and two 30mm MK 108 cannons, plus 1,000kg bomb load. First flown in early Summer 1942, it proved far superior to the Ar 240. Production was eventually rejected in favour of the Dornier Do 335.

<text>The University of Urbino Carlo Bo (, &quot;UniUrb&quot;) is an Italian university located in Urbino, a walled hill-town in the region of Marche, located in the north-eastern part of central Italy. The University was founded as Law school in 1506 by Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, with the name of &quot;Collegio dei Dottori&quot; (&#x27;school of doctors&#x27;, while in Italy doctor was – and is – a title attributed to anyone with a master&#x27;s degree).

Starting from the 1960s/70s, under the guidance of Carlo Bo as Rector and in the following years, the University succeeded in buying up numerous derelict buildings in the historic centre of the town (now a UNESCO World Heritage Site), there buildings which have since been restored and used as faculty, department and library buildings. While the student body and faculties gradually increased and developed over time, it was under the long-lasting rectorship of professor Carlo Bo, distinguished humanist and Senator for Life, that the University enjoyed unprecedented growth in size and prestige, prompting the former president of the European Commission, Roy Jenkins, to state that &quot;the University of Urbino is an incisive presence in contemporary thought, contributing in original ways to the cultural and intellectual life of Europe&quot;. This was also the period in which architect Giancarlo De Carlo designed and built the University Halls of Residence and redesigned and modernised several of the university&#x27;s other buildings.

The University of Urbino currently has six departments and two institutes, over 14,000 students, many of whom are from overseas, about 800 teachers and 400 administrative staff members. Like already explained, the University occupies numerous buildings throughout the historic town centre of Urbino, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as whole, and this its de facto Campus. The University also occupies buildings in the close countryside. The main accommodation blocks are situated at a quite short distance from the historic town center.

Urbino has been a centre for culture and studies since the age of Federico da Montefeltro. The Law school was founded in 1506. Nowadays the University of Urbino is also renowned for teaching and research in Sports Science, Humanities, Biology and Computer science, and for the good reputation of its courses.

<text>Kamerun was an African colony of the German Empire from 1884 to 1916 in the region of today&#x27;s Republic of Cameroon. Kamerun also included northern parts of Gabon and the Congo with western parts of the Central African Republic, southwestern parts of Chad and far northeastern parts of Nigeria.

== History ==
=== Years preceding colonization (1868–1883) ===
The first German trading post in the Duala area on the Kamerun River delta was established in 1868 by the Hamburg trading company . The firm&#x27;s primary agent in Gabon, Johannes Thormählen, expanded activities to the Kamerun River delta. In 1874, together with the Woermann agent in Liberia, Wilhelm Jantzen, the two merchants founded their own company, Jantzen &amp; Thormählen there.

Both of these West Africa houses expanded into shipping with their own sailing ships and steamers and inaugurated scheduled passenger and freight service between Hamburg and Duala. These companies and others obtained extensive acreage from local chiefs and began systematic plantation operations, including bananas. The Cameroon territory was under the informal control of the British Empire throughout the years preceding 1884, with substantial British trading operations as well.

Eventually, these companies would begin agitating for royal protection. By 1884, Adolph Woermann, as spokesman for all West African companies, petitioned the imperial foreign office for &quot;protection&quot; by the German Empire. This, among a number of other factors, led to Imperial Chancellor Otto von Bismarck approving the establishment of a colony.

==== Colonial goals and motivation ====
For many years prior to the 1880s, Bismarck had resisted the idea of colonial ventures in Africa. This was primarily due to Bismarck&#x27;s focus on shoring up German interests in Europe itself, especially given the lack of a military infrastructure able to protect colonial interests. Moreover, Germany had no need for the resources that a colony might provide, being largely self sufficient, so a colony would only function as an economic drain. This perspective would change in the early 1880s, due to a variety of internal pressures.

The two key factors motivating this change were pressure from economic interests in Germany, and concerns about missing out on what would later be called the Scramble for Africa. On the political side, colonies became a point of national pride, as Germans saw that other nations had colonies, and thought they should too as a matter of national prestige. Several government officials took this stance, and it seemed to enjoy public support as well. On the commercial side, the companies already operating in Cameroon (represented by the likes of Adolph Woermann) wanted the protection and support an official German colony would provide, and many German producers sought new markets for their excess goods.

These pressures would eventually culminate in Bismarck allowing the establishment of a Cameroonian colony, among others.

=== Initial colonization (1884–1889/90) ===
The official beginning of the German &quot;Protectorate of Cameroon&quot; was on 17 August 1884. Gustav Nachtigal had arrived in Duala in July and negotiated a treaty with a number of rulers local to the region around Duala, at that time the center of Germany&#x27;s trading operations. From there, he would go on to other parts of Cameroon, securing further treaties with a number of tribes of the regions around the rivers, where trade was already well established. This would establish a trend of using treaties as one method of expanding German control.

As mentioned above, one of the primary motivations for the colony was German corporations seeking to expand their economic interests in Cameroon. Bismarck, being aware of this fact and concerned about the substantial costs of a directly administered colony, opted to instead grant the companies already involved in Cameroon a &quot;Chartered&quot; status. As such, initial government fell to large German trading companies and concession companies who had already established themselves in the colony.

Eventually, however, it was revealed that the companies were not performing their administrative duties very well. A variety of factors contributed to their failure, but foremost among them were ongoing conflicts with local traders as the traders began to move further inland. This got bad enough that it necessitated the German government stepping in and officially taking over.

=== Expansionary era of colonization (1890–1906) ===

From thereon out the administration of the colonies would be at the hands of the German administrators. Regardless, the focus of the colony remained the same: to support the plantation industry and the trade of the German companies. As such, this time saw major expansion in the agricultural industry, and efforts were taken to expand further into the landlocked areas of Cameroon to better trade opportunities and German access to the African interior.

The most notable of the German governors, and the man who would come to define the German legacy in Cameroon, would be Jesko Von Puttkammer, who governed from 1895–1906 (and for a few shorter times before). It was Puttkammer who began the German behaviors that lend them a reputation of brutality and harshness as colonizers. During his time, he oversaw a number of military campaigns against local peoples like the Bali, forcing those who rebuffed German attempts at a &quot;treaty&quot; that supposedly justified German expansion. Oftentimes, he would not act directly against these people, instead relying on empowering other rival local powers and establishing them as &quot;protected by Germany&quot; and arming them. These groups would then use their newfound power and armaments to conquer dissenting peoples, without the Germans themselves actually ever getting involved.

When the Germans did become involved, however, it was brutal, often going out of their way to punish those who surrendered to them if their leader still refused, and taking a tithe of people from conquered peoples as essentially slaves, though they did not call them such. Puttkammer and fellow governor Hans Dominik were responsible for large-scale massacres. At Nachtigal Falls the local adult population was massacred for refusing German protection. The babies of the natives were put in baskets and drowned in the river. Dominik was also known for ordering the mutilation of dead bodies or even living men.

This leads into the second prominent feature of Puttkamer&#x27;s governorship, his expansion and support for the plantations. This became a problem, as the plantations had more fields than they did workers, so there was a labor shortage. To address this, Puttkamer instituted the &quot;man tithes&quot; mentioned above, in addition to just taking people whenever they conquered new territories or had to put down a rebellion. These people would then be made to do harsh forced labor, with extremely high rates of death. Extreme forms of discipline were practiced too, including the cutting of hands, genitals, gouging of eyes and decapitations. Severed limbs were often collected and shown to local authorities as proof of death. Punishments such as flogging were so excessive the German colonies were referred to as the &quot;Flogging Colonies&quot;.

These practices, which continued even after Puttkammer retired from his position, would define the German colonial legacy.

In German Cameroon the indigenous slave trade were banned in 1902 and all slaves born after 1902 declared born free; however the slave trade supplied by slave raids in Northern German Cameroon were, in practice, tolerated the entire German colonial period.

=== Final years (1907–1916) ===

After Puttkamer left his position, aggressive expansion was less common (though more territory would be added via diplomatic means), and the colony began to focus more on development. With subsidies from the imperial treasury, the colony built two rail lines from the port city of Duala to bring agricultural products to market. The Northern line extended to the Manenguba mountains, and the mainline went to Makak on the river Nyong. An extensive postal and telegraph system and a river navigation network with government ships connected the coast to the interior.

The Cameroon protectorate was enlarged with New Cameroon (German: Neukamerun) in 1911 as part of the settlement of the Agadir Crisis, resolved by the Treaty of Fez.

=== Loss of Cameroon as a colony ===
At the outbreak of World War I, French, Belgian and British troops invaded the German colony in 1914 and fully occupied it during the Kamerun campaign. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat, the Treaty of Versailles divided the territory into two League of Nations mandates (Class B) under the administration of the United Kingdom and France. French Cameroon and part of British Cameroon reunified in 1961 to form present-day Cameroon.

Notably, this did not end German involvement in Cameroon, as many former German plantation owners bought their plantations back in the 1920s and 30s. It would take until World War II before Germany was &quot;fully out&quot; of Cameroon.

<doc id="454875" wikidata="Q618355" url="?curid=454875" title="Apple juice">
<text>Apple juice is a fruit juice made by the maceration and pressing of an apple. The resulting expelled juice may be further treated by enzymatic and centrifugal clarification to remove the starch and pectin, which holds fine particulate in suspension, and then pasteurized for packaging in glass, metal, or aseptic processing system containers, or further treated by dehydration processes to a concentrate. 

Due to the complex and costly equipment required to extract and clarify juice from apples in large volume, apple juice is normally produced commercially. In the United States, unfiltered fresh apple juice is made by smaller operations in areas of high apple production, in the form of unclarified apple cider. Apple juice is one of the most common fruit juices globally, with world production led by China, Poland, the United States, and Germany.

==Production==
Apples used for apple juice are usually harvested between September and mid-November in the Northern Hemisphere and between February and mid-April in the Southern Hemisphere. A common cultivar used for apple juice is the McIntosh. Approximately two medium McIntosh apples produce around of juice. After the apples are picked, they are washed and transported to the processing facility. The apples are then pressed and juiced right away to avoid spoilage. Depending on the company and end-product, the apples can be processed in different ways before pressing. Apple juice is then filtered, with the number of solid particles remaining partly defining the difference between apple juice and apple cider. In cases where the apple juice is treated enzymatically, the typical class of enzymes used are pectinases.

==Pasteurization==
Because apple juice is acidic, typically with a pH of 3.4, it can be pasteurized for less time or at lower temperatures than many other juices. For this purpose, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends the following thermal processing times and temperatures in order to achieve a five-log reduction of &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot; as this parasite is more heat resistant than &quot;E. coli&quot; 0157:

* for at least 6 seconds
* for at least 2.8 seconds
* for at least 1.3 seconds
* for at least 0.6 second
* for at least 0.3 second

===Unpasteurized juice and foodborne illnesses===
From 2000 to 2010, there were over 1700 cases in North America of illnesses related to drinking unpasteurized juice and ciders. The pathogens related to these food-borne illnesses included parasites, bacteria, and viruses. The most common pathogens were &quot;E. coli&quot; 0157 and 0111, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;, &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;, and hepatitis A. Pathogens can be spread in a number of ways, such as contamination where the fruit is grown, being carried in contaminated containers, or due to poor handling and washing.

==Composition and nutrition==
Apple juice is 88% water and 11% carbohydrates (including 10% sugars), with negligible content of protein or fat. A 100 ml reference amount of unsweetened apple juice supplies 46 calories and no significant content of any micronutrients.

==Storage==
Fresh apple juice requires refrigeration. Sealed bottles of canned apple juice can be stored in a dark, cool place, such as a pantry or cupboard, to delay the degradation of the product. The appearance, texture, or taste of the juice might change over time.

Once the juice package is opened, or if it was not sealed and shipped without needing refrigeration by the manufacturer, it must be resealed tightly and refrigerated to avoid contamination from microorganisms such as bacteria. The ideal storage temperature for apple juice is between and .

==Apple cider==

While &quot;apple juice&quot; generally refers to the filtered, pasteurised product of apple pressing, an unfiltered and sometimes unpasteurized version of the juice is commonly known as &quot;apple cider&quot; in the United States and parts of Canada. Seeking to capitalize on this, some makers of filtered and clarified juice (including carbonated varieties) label and sell their product as &quot;apple cider.&quot; Legal distinctions are not universal and elusive to apply.

Elsewhere in the world, particularly in New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom, the simple term cider refers to fermented fruit juice, usually made from apples but also from pears; this alcoholic beverage is known as &quot;hard cider&quot; in much of North America.

<doc id="454881" wikidata="Q1046170" url="?curid=454881" title="Carvetii">
<text>The Carvetii (Common Brittonic: *&quot;Carwetī&quot;) were a Brittonic Celtic tribe living in what is now Cumbria, in North-West England during the Iron Age, and were subsequently identified as a &quot;civitas&quot; (canton) of Roman Britain.

== Etymology ==
The suffix &quot;carv-&quot; is related to Welsh &quot;carw&quot;, Breton &quot;karv&quot; and Irish &quot;carow&quot; (&#x27;deer&#x27;). Richard von Kienle has proposed the translation &quot;those who belong to the deer&quot;.

==Location==
Historical speculation has the Carvetii occupying the Solway Plain, the area immediately south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, the Eden Valley, and possibly the Lune Valley.

The Setantii may have occupied North Lancashire and south Cumbria.

==Evidence of existence==
The Carvetii are not mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, nor in any other classical text, and are known only from three Roman (third and fourth century AD) inscriptions, one of which is now lost. One was in Old Penrith, (the Voreda Roman fort) north of the present Penrith, on a tombstone. The others were on two milestones: one at Frenchfield (north of Brocavum), and the other at Langwathby in Cumbria, both also near Penrith. Higham and Jones, in 1985, suggested that the combination of the first two inscriptions mentioned above &quot;allows us to infer the existence of the &#x27;civitas Carvetiorum&#x27;, or canton of the Carvetii, and the existence of its own council or governing body.&quot;

==Capital or centre==
The capital of the Carvetii is presumed to have been &quot;Luguvalium&quot; (Carlisle), the only walled town known in the region. Higham and Jones suggest, given the location of the inscriptions, and given that the best land in the area was nearby, and also given the existence of a large (7 acres, 3 ha.) enclosed settlement site a couple of miles south-east of Penrith in the Eden Valley, that Clifton Dykes was the &quot;logical location for the &#x27;caput Carvetiorum&#x27; &quot; (&#x27;the centre of the Carvetii&#x27;). In other words, despite the later importance of Carlisle as the centre of activity once the Romans had invaded (and the likely place where tribal councils would take place), the Eden Valley &quot;was the heartland of the area concerned.&quot; The Brougham area, with its seeming importance in the cult of Belatucadrus, its strategic position in the Eden Valley with its route to the east across Stainmore, its nearby history as a meeting place with three henges, as well as with &quot;the presumed pre-Roman tribal capital at Clifton Dykes&quot;, may have been the settlement focus of the Carvetii, at least before the Roman military campaigns in the AD 70s. Indeed, this might account for the building of the Roman fort at Brocavum. Rivet and Smith suggest that the name &#x27;Carvetii&#x27; may refer to the British word &#x27;carvos&#x27;, meaning &#x27;deer&#x27; or &#x27;stag&#x27;, and that this could have associations with the horned god Belatucadrus mentioned above.

The Roman fort at Stanwix, on the north side of the River Eden, was one component of what was to become Carlisle. The other seems to have been a major settlement of people south of the river, with an Agricolan fort (A.D.78-79), re-built in the second century, roughly where the present Carlisle Castle now is. A stone fort was built on the site around 200 A.D. The excavations in the Blackfriars and Lanes areas indicate a substantial vicus, or civilian settlement, associated with the several stages of this fort.

==Links with the Brigantes and Venutius==
The Carvetii may have been part of the neighbouring Brigantes confederation, and some, including Higham and Jones, have speculated that Venutius, first husband of the Brigantian queen Cartimandua and later (69 A.D.) an important British resistance leader in the 1st century, may have been a Carvetian. The series of marching camps set up by the Roman governor Quintus Petillius Cerialis, in his campaign in the early 70s, stretched away from Stanwick, across the Stainmore Pass towards the Eden Valley, suggesting that the Carvetii were the &quot;centre of Venutius&#x27; power base and the prime objective of the ... campaigns&quot;.

Ross, however, challenges these assumptions. She argues that the very notion of &#x27;tribe&#x27;, in the sense of a geographically-defined unit, probably did not exist in the north; that there is no evidence either of the Brigantes holding power over the northern &#x27;tribes&#x27;, or of a Brigantian &#x27;confederacy&#x27; of tribes; that there is no certain interpretation of the three inscriptions; that there is no written evidence of Venutius being of the Carvetii; and that the archaeological evidence and the persistence of the name &#x27;Luguvalos&#x27; at what was to become &#x27;Carlisle&#x27;, may point to the Carvetii being a pro-Roman tribe based in the Solway Plain with a centre at Carlisle, while Venutius may have led an anti-Roman, non-Carvetiian, tribe elsewhere, probably in the upper-Eden valley south of Penrith.

<text>Venutius was a 1st-century king of the Brigantes in northern Britain at the time of the Roman conquest. Some have suggested he may have belonged to the Carvetii, a tribe that probably formed part of the Brigantes confederation.

History first becomes aware of him as husband of Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes, in about 51 AD. After the British resistance leader Caratacus was defeated by Publius Ostorius Scapula in Wales, he fled north to the Brigantes, only to be handed over to the Romans by Cartimandua. While the Brigantes were nominally an independent kingdom, Tacitus says Cartimandua and Venutius were loyal to Rome and &quot;defended by Roman power&quot;. However, after the capture of Caratacus, Venutius became the most prominent leader of resistance to the Roman occupation. Cartimandua had apparently tired of him and married his armour-bearer, Vellocatus, whom she elevated to the kingship in Venutius&#x27;s place. Initially, Venutius sought only to overthrow his ex-wife, only later turning his attention to her Roman protectors. The Romans defended their client queen and Venutius&#x27;s revolt was defeated by Caesius Nasica during the governorship of Aulus Didius Gallus (52 - 57 AD).

Taking advantage of Roman instability during the year of four emperors, Venutius revolted again, this time in 69 AD. Cartimandua appealed for troops from the Romans, who were only able to send auxiliaries. Cartimandua was evacuated and Venutius took the kingdom.

This second revolt may have had wider repercussions: Tacitus says that Vespasian, once emperor, had to &quot;recover&quot; Britain. He also says, introducing the events of the year of four emperors, that Britain was abandoned having only just been pacified (although some think this is in reference to the consolidation of Agricola&#x27;s later conquests in Caledonia (Scotland)).

What happened to Venutius after the accession of Vespasian is not recorded. Quintus Petillius Cerialis (governor 71 to 74 AD) campaigned against the Brigantes, but they were not completely subdued for many decades: Agricola (governor 78 to 84 AD) appears to have campaigned in Brigantian territory, and both the Roman poet Juvenal and the Greek geographer Pausanias refer to warfare against the Brigantes in the first half of the second century.

<doc id="454884" wikidata="Q1547484" url="?curid=454884" title="Hornpipe">
<text>The hornpipe is any of several dance forms and their associated tunes, played and danced in Great Britain and Ireland and elsewhere from the 16th century until the present day. The earliest references to hornpipes are from England, with Hugh Aston&#x27;s Hornepype of 1522 and others referring to Lancashire hornpipes in 1609 and 1613. The name originally referred to a kind of wind instrument and was only later transferred to the dance.

It is suggested that the hornpipe as a dance began around the 16th century on English sailing vessels. However, the dance does not seem to have become associated with sailors until after 1740 when the dancer Yates performed &quot;a hornpipe in the character of a Jack Tar&quot; at Drury Lane Theatre, after which, in 1741 at Covent Garden we hear of &quot;a hornpipe by a gentleman in the character of a sailor&quot;. Movements were those familiar to sailors of that time: &quot;looking out to sea&quot; with the right hand to the forehead, then the left, lurching as in heavy weather, and giving the occasional rhythmic tug to their breeches both fore and aft.

== Folk hornpipes ==
The hornpipe is an Irish, Scottish and English folk dance and tune. It is done in hard shoes, which are used to help keep track of how the dancer keeps in time. There are two variations of the hornpipe dance: fast and slow. Usually, more experienced dancers will do the slow hornpipe, but younger dancers will start out with the fast hornpipe and then switch in later years. There is a change of tempo in the music, but not the dancing between these two speeds. The only difference in the dancing between the fast and slow steps are the dances that the competitor does and the rhythm/sound of how they move their legs. The rhythm for both fast and slow hornpipes is very even and should be executed that way by the dancer.

* The most common use of the term nowadays refers to a class of tunes in time. The dance is done in hard shoes. Perhaps the best known example is the &quot;Sailors&#x27; Hornpipe&quot;. There are two basic types of common-time hornpipe, ones like the &quot;Sailors&#x27; Hornpipe&quot;, moving in even notes, sometimes notated in , moving a little slower than a reel, and ones like &quot;The Harvest Home&quot;, moving in dotted notes. Some 19th-century examples mix the dotted and even styles. These led the form to being called the &#x27;Newcastle Style&#x27; The form dates back to the mid-18th century or earlier, but became much more popular in the early 19th century. Many hornpipes were written in this period, often with well-known composers. In Ireland, examples include &quot;The Groves Hornpipe&quot; and &quot;The Boys of Bluehill&quot;. In England, a noted composer of hornpipes on Tyneside was the influential fiddler-publican James Hill (c.1811–1853). The form also became very popular in the United States – &quot;President Garfield&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot; being an example.
* A lively time dance rhythm, which remained popular in northern English and lowland Scottish instrumental music until the 19th century. Many examples are still well known and widely played in Northumberland, such as the song &quot;Dance ti thy Daddy&quot;, and the variation set &quot;Lads of Alnwick&quot;. Often these tunes have off-beat accents, usually in even-numbered bars, presumably corresponding to the (lost) dance steps. The form, having short strains, with a simple fixed harmonic scheme, and recognisable tags at the ends, is very suitable for the playing of variations. This has probably accounted for its survival among players of the Northumbrian smallpipes. &quot;Lads of Alnwick&quot;, in particular, has survived in the oral and manuscript tradition without major change from its earliest known appearance in the 1730s in William Dixon&#x27;s MS, until the modern era, when an almost identical 5-strain version was written down by Tom Clough.
* The term was also used formerly to refer to tunes in or time. These may have been thought of as differing only inessentially from the hornpipes. Some early examples of these are also syncopated. The form survives in Northumberland and Ireland. One example, &quot;Mad Moll&quot;, or &quot;The Peacock Follows the Hen&quot;, has remained current since at least 1698 when it appeared in &quot;The Dancing Master&quot;. Such tunes are usually referred to nowadays by the Irish name slip jig.

Examples, current in Northumberland, of all these kinds of hornpipe may be found, either recorded or notated, on the FARNE archive website . The earliest musician&#x27;s manuscript to contain hornpipes is the Henry Atkinson MS (a Facsimile of which may be found at FARNE). John Offord&#x27;s &quot;John of the Green – The Cheshire Way&quot; (), is an extensive study of published and manuscript dance music in these forms from before 1750. This draws heavily on Thomas Marsden&#x27;s &quot;Original Lancashire Hornpipes, Old and New&quot;, published by Henry Playford in 1705, as well as other sources.

In 1798 the Reverend Warner Warner journeyed through Wales. In describing a Welsh ball, he wrote, &quot;The ball was concluded by a contest of agility between two brothers, who danced two distinct hornpipes with so much power and muscle, variety of step and inflexible perseverance, as exceeded everything we had seen.

== Baroque hornpipe ==

The triple-time hornpipe dance rhythm was often used by composers in England in the Baroque period. It is probably artificial to draw too rigid a distinction between the popular and art-music examples. Many country dance examples are found in &quot;The Dancing Master&quot;, such as &quot;The Hole in the Wall&quot; (Hornpipe No.8 from the incidental music to &quot;Abdelazer&quot; by Henry Purcell), and there are also extant notated theatrical and ball choreographies that use steps from French court ballet, but which characteristically have some step-units going across the measure. Henry Purcell and George Frideric Handel composed hornpipes, and Handel occasionally gave &quot;alla hornpipe&quot; as a tempo indication (see Handel&#x27;s &quot;Water Music&quot;). Today, the most well-known baroque hornpipe tune is probably the &#x27;Alla Hornpipe&#x27; movement from the D major of Handel&#x27;s Water Music suites. Hornpipes are occasionally found in German music of this period.

<doc id="454888" wikidata="Q7866672" url="?curid=454888" title="USNS Ponchatoula (T-AO-148)">
<text>USS &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; (AO-148) was one of six &quot;Neosho&quot;-class fleet oilers built for the United States Navy, in service from 1956 to 1992, and named for the Ponchatoula Creek which rises in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, and flows into the Natalbany River, west of Ponchatoula, Louisiana. She was the second U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name.

&quot;Ponchatoula&quot; was laid down at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, on 1 March 1954, launched on 9 July 1955, sponsored by Mrs. I. N. Kiland, and commissioned on 12 January 1956.

==Service history==
After fitting out at Philadelphia, &quot;Ponchatoula&quot;, the sixth of a class designed to combine speed and large cargo capacity for rapid underway replenishment over extended operational periods, got underway for the Pacific. Arriving at Long Beach, California, on 10 March, she underwent shakedown and training exercises off the California coast and in September deployed to the Far East. En route she assisted &quot;SS Venus&quot;, a Panamanian merchantman lying helpless on the fringes of two typhoons. Taking &quot;Venus&quot; in tow on the 26th, &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; was relieved of her tow on the 28th, and continued on to Sasebo to join the 7th Fleet.
Rotated regularly to the western Pacific, &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; was homeported at Pearl Harbor in early 1958 and received her introduction to support under hostile conditions while operating with 7th Fleet units during the Quemoy-Matsu Crisis in the fall of that year.

Support for experimental operations highlighted 1962 as she provided POL (petroleum, oil, lubricants) services to Joint Task Force 8 engaged in &quot;Operation Dominic I&quot; (the Christmas Island nuclear test series), then operated with Project Mercury recovery ships during the &quot;Sigma 7&quot; splashdown. Repeating that support with &quot;Faith 7&quot; in 1963, she shifted to combat operations in October 1964 and deployed to the South China Sea to refuel ships employ the coast of Vietnam. After 279 refuelings, she returned to Hawaiian waters. In June 1965 she participated in recovery operations for &quot;Gemini 4&quot;, then deployed again to Vietnam. In December she interrupted operations there to support the recovery ships for &quot;Gemini 6&quot; and &quot;Gemini 7&quot; and in April 1966 returned to Hawaii after having set a new record in the Pacific Fleet by bringing 503 ships alongside, 464 of which she refueled. Deployed to WestPac again in November 1967, she pumped over of fuel through her hoses before returning home in June 1968. In October she again joined ships in the Pacific splashdown area, this time to recover &quot;Apollo 7&quot;, the first U.S. three-man flight.
By 8 December, &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; was back in the Philippines, whence she got underway for &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin on the 15th again to replenish ships operating in support of Allied operations in Vietnam. &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; earned twelve battle stars for Vietnam War service. In July 1969, she returned home and into 1970 remained in Hawaiian waters.

In 1972 she refueled USS &quot;Berkeley&quot; (DDG 15) home bound from the Vietnam War.

Decommissioned on 5 September 1980 (Captain Jack C. Presley), &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; was placed in service with the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as USNS &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; (T-AO-148) where she served with the Seventh Fleet in the Persian Gulf during Operation Fiery Vigil, Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. She was badly damaged in a collision with the guided missile cruiser &quot;USS Chancellorsville (CG62)&quot; in August 1991. The &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; suffered a steering casualty during underway replenishment operations and heeled sharply to port, ramming the &quot;Ponchatoula&#x27;s&quot; starboard side at the Bridge, then sliding down the starboard side of the ship, buckling the upper deck plates of the &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; to the engine house and damaging the &quot;Chancellorsville&#x27;s&quot; hurricane bow and sonar dome. &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 August 1992; her title was transferred to MARAD on 1 May 1999 for lay-up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. MARAD listed &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; still at Suisun Bay in February 2007. She was towed from Suisun Bay on June 5, 2014 to be dismantled in Brownsville, Texas. Her final voyage is chronicled at http://navy.memorieshop.com/Ponchatoula/Last-Voyage.html.

<text>Northwood is a Canadian teen drama television series created by Nick Orchard. It centres on the lives of teenagers living in the eponymous fictional North Vancouver suburb. It aired on CBC from March 4, 1991 to January 15, 1994.

Most initial reviews of the series were mixed, with criticism given to its excessive melodrama, lack of comic relief, and production values, though praise was given to the acting performances. Having replaced &quot;Degrassi High&quot; in its time slot, &quot;Northwood&quot; also drew multiple comparisons to the outgoing show. As it progressed, reviews became more positive.

A soundtrack album, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, was released in 1992. It is composed of adult contemporary covers by cast members of the show.

== Cast ==
* Lochlyn Munro as Jason Williams
* Brigitta Dau as Maria Giovanni
* Byron Lucas as Kirk Huber
* Trevor Hughes as Peter Anderson
* Tasmin Jones as Karin Anderson
* Darrell Dennis as Brian Potter
* Maggie Blue O&#x27;Hara as Nicole Williams
* Gabe Khouth as Michael Thomas
* Deanna Milligan as Jennifer McBride

== Reception ==
Those involved with the show, including creator Nick Orchard and actor Lochlyn Munro, stated it to be &quot;grittier&quot; and &quot;meatier&quot; than the outgoing &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, of which &quot;Northwood&quot; replaced in the 8:30pm Monday timeslot. Despite this, most early reviews of Northwood were mixed, with negative reviews drawing comparisons to &quot;Degrassi&quot;. Bob Remington of the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; rated it two stars and criticized what he felt to be the excessively melodramatic and humourless behavior of its characters, although he acknowledged the actors&#x27; competence. He also referred to &quot;Degrassi&quot; character Joey Jeremiah multiple times as an example of comic relief that he felt &quot;Northwood&quot; lacked. Janice Kennedy, writing for the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, was more lenient in her criticism, saying that while the show cut corners and fell into soap opera cliches unlike &quot;Degrassi&quot;, it boasted &quot;solid acting&quot; and &quot;credible portrayal&quot; from its actors, and stated that it had potential if it evolved beyond its trappings. Tony Atherton of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen,&quot; while also giving it a mixed review, rejected the &quot;Degrassi&quot; comparisons.

Mike Boone, writing for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, gave a more positive review, stating the show set itself apart from others because of its characters&#x27; &quot;quintessential Canadian stoicism and unhipness&quot;, and praised the &quot;strong cast of gifted young actors&quot;. Similarly, &quot;The StarPhoenix&quot;&#x27;s Erica Smishek opined: &quot;Strong performances by a well-rounded cast, effective location shooting and a grainy visual quality enhance the gritty appeal of Northwood. Now all its creators need is an audience for the six-episode test run.&quot;.

==Streaming==
In 2019, the series was made available for free on Canada Media Fund&#x27;s Encore+ YouTube channel. The channel shut down on November 30, 2022.

<text>The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 40 was a prototype armoured German glider initially designed in mid-1943 by Blohm &amp; Voss to attack Allied bomber formations during World War II. The BV 40 would be towed to high altitude by single-engined fighters and then ram the bombers while in a dive, but this concept was rejected before its first flight in May 1944 in favour of using its guns. The Luftwaffe had lost interest in the BV 40&#x27;s original mission the month prior; development continued as its mission changed to attacking ships with specialized bombs. Blohm &amp; Voss discovered that the prototypes were significantly overweight, and some of the armour and one gun had to be removed to conduct flight testing. The BV 40 was cancelled in August with only 6 gliders completed out of the 21 ordered. All of the aircraft were destroyed in an air raid in October.

==Design and description==
Conceived in mid-1943 by Richard Vogt, chief designer and technical director of Blohm &amp; Voss, the BV 40 was to be towed by a single-engined Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter to high altitude and released above the Allied bombers&#x27; combat box. Once released, it would dive down at a sharp angle towards the enemy bombers and ram the vertical stabiliser of a bomber, causing it to crash, and thus also disrupting the close-flying bomber formation. The German Air Ministry () responded favourably to his proposal on 19 August and added a requirement for a single 30 mm (1.2 in) MK 108 cannon to neutralise the bomber&#x27;s rear gunner. In order to minimise the aircraft&#x27;s cross-section as a target for the gunner and improve the pilot&#x27;s resistance to G-forces, he would lie in the prone position since a 1940 study using centrifuges had estimated an increase from 5Gs to 12Gs. 

The German Aviation Research Institute () had commissioned a small experimental aircraft, the Akaflieg Berlin B9, in 1942 to evaluate the engineering requirements of a powered aircraft with a prone pilot. Blohm &amp; Voss engineers and pilots flew the aircraft in September 1943 to aid in the development of the BV 40. The following month, Vogt wrote to the Air Ministry stating that further studies had shown that attacking from the rear was infeasible due to the extreme altitude required to gain the necessary speed to overtake the bombers. He also stated: &quot;In view of the psychological difficulties [of a ramming attack] and the need to put considerable weight into ram-proof wings, we would like to propose... refraining from intentional ramming for the time being and sticking to close range shooting attacks as the task.&quot;

A series of meetings in December with the Air Ministry and the Office of the Inspector of Fighters () finalized the BV 40&#x27;s configuration. The armament was increased to two MK 108 guns, which were moved from the initial position on the top of the fuselage to wing-root pods, and a Schlinge Device () was added. This was a bomb towed behind the aircraft on a sharp cable that was intended to be flown over an enemy bomber. Either the bomb would hit the bomber or the cable would snag it, potentially swinging the bomb into the bomber, and the cable would snap on impact.

The glider was designed to use non-strategic materials and to be built in as short a time as possible by non-skilled workers. It was of conventional layout, having a shoulder-mounted, straight, untapered wooden wing with a similarly-shaped tailplane mounted part way up the vertical stabiliser. The wing had a box spar at its leading edge and an auxiliary spar at the rear. The glider&#x27;s flaps were usually lowered to an angle of 50° for landing, but could be further lowered to 80° if necessary. There was no conventional undercarriage as the aircraft was designed to use a one-axle trolley for take-off, to be dropped once the glider was airborne. A skid under the nose was lowered for landing.

The fuselage of the first prototype was built in three sections of which only the aft portion was built from wood. The center section was made from sheet steel thick, although the pilot&#x27;s legs were protected by steel plates. It could be jettisoned from the forward section to allow the pilot to bail out. The cockpit occupied the forward fuselage and was entirely formed from flat armour plates with some wooden fairings to reduce aerodynamic drag. Above the cockpit was the armoured canopy that was hinged at the rear. The thicknesses of the armour ranged from 8 millimetres at the front to at the rear. The sides of the canopy were fitted with sliding glass windows. Two plates covered the front of the cockpit; the lower plate was vertical, but the upper plate angled backwards toward the pilot. The upper plate incorporated a windscreen of bulletproof glass thick. The sides consisted of 8-millimetre plates that included small glass windows that could be covered by sliding steel plates. Together with the windscreen, these gave the pilot a 35° view up and down and 20° from side to side. The floor of the cockpit consisted of a 5-millimetre plate. To reduce magnetic deviation from the armour plates, the compass protruded from the aircraft&#x27;s nose and could only be viewed by the pilot via mirrors. 

Each MK 108 gun was provided with 35 rounds. The guns were mounted on their sides and ammunition belts fed them from the top, with the cartridge cases ejected out bottom of the gun pods. The belts extended the length of the wing and were protected by narrow 8-millimetre armour plates. The gunsight was painted on the interior and exterior of the windscreen. As of 7 January 1944, Blohm &amp; Voss was uncertain whether the Schlinge Device could be installed in the aft fuselage or would have to replace a gun pod.

==Development==
Construction of six prototypes began in December 1943, designated V1–V6 (), including one airframe for stress testing to destruction, and another 15 prototypes were ordered on 15 February 1944. As production progressed, over-optimistic weight estimates were revealed during a meeting on 16 February and a drastic weight reduction program had to be implemented. Blohm &amp; Voss informed the Air Ministry that the six gliders already begun would have to be lightened by to allow flight testing to begin as scheduled. The changes included the substitution of wood for steel in the upper canopy and the sliding steel shutters, and ordinary glass for the bulletproof windscreen. One gun and its ammunition and armour would be deleted as would the leg armour.

At the same time, the specifications for the production BV 40s were also modified to save , bringing the gross weight down to approximately . All 8-millimetre plates were reduced to in thickness, and the middle fuselage section was to use wood rather than sheet steel. In addition the ammunition armour was to be deleted, lightening holes were to be drilled in most structural members and the skin of the wings and flight control surfaces were reduced in thickness. These changes compromised the glider&#x27;s structural strength, which reduced its estimated safe diving speed to a maximum of above and closer to the ground. Rocket propulsion was also considered, but was judged unsuitable.

The Office of the Inspector of Fighters had lost interest in the BV 40 programme by 20 April, but development work continued under the auspices of Bomber Group 200 ( (KG 200)), the Luftwaffe&#x27;s special operations force. The unit had decided to investigate the possibility of using manned glide bombs against Allied invasion shipping. Blohm &amp; Voss&#x27; response was to substitute a pair of BT700 () weapons for the gun pods, with the gliders to be carried aloft by Heinkel He 177 heavy bombers, one under each wing. The BT700s were bombs that were designed to be dropped short of the target and travel underwater before detonating. They had warheads that weighed either . While not strictly suicide weapons because the pilots could possibly pull up in time to avoid hitting their targets, the gliders would have nowhere to land and the armoured cockpits would sink very quickly.

The first prototype was completed in late April 1944 and made an unsuccessful attempt to get off the ground between 27 April and 2 May. A second attempt on 6 May was successful, but the V1 was badly damaged while landing on 2 June. V2 had been completed by this time and took over the majority of the flight testing beginning on 5 June that lasted until 26 July. The BV 40 made a total of 17 flights. The highest speed attained by any of the BV 40s was , and it was thought to have the potential to go far faster.

Blohm &amp; Voss lacked the resources to pursue the other variants of the BV 40 requested by KG 200 and was not able to build any gliders beyond those already ordered. The Air Ministry had grown disenchanted with the programme by late July and acceded to a request by Blohm &amp; Voss to stop further work on the incomplete aircraft on 27 July. By this time V7 of the second batch was on track to be completed in August and construction had begun on V8 through V14 with deliveries scheduled through March 1945. The Luftwaffe formally cancelled the programme on 13 August. Blohm &amp; Voss stored all of the BV 40s in a hangar at its airfield in Wenzendorf, but this was bombed by Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers on 6 October and destroyed.

<text>Ingólfr Arnarson, in some sources named Bjǫrnólfsson, ( – )
is commonly recognized as the first permanent Norse settler of Iceland, together with his wife Hallveig Fróðadóttir and foster brother Hjörleifr Hróðmarsson. According to tradition, they settled in Reykjavík in 874.

==Biography==
Ingólfr Arnarson was from the valley of Rivedal in Sunnfjord in western Norway. According to the Icelandic Book of Settlements, he built his homestead in and gave name to Reykjavík in 874. However, archaeological finds in Iceland suggest settlement may have started somewhat earlier. The medieval chronicler Ari Þorgilsson said Ingólfr was the first Nordic settler in Iceland, but mentioned that Irish monks had been in the country before the Norsemen. He wrote that they left because they did not want to live among the newly arrived Norse pagans.

The Book of Settlements (written two to three centuries after the settlement) contains a story about Ingólf&#x27;s arrival. The book claims he left Norway after becoming involved in a blood feud. He had heard about a new island which Garðar Svavarsson, Hrafna-Flóki and others had found in the Atlantic Ocean. With his blood brother Hjörleifr Hróðmarsson, he sailed for Iceland. When land was in sight, he threw his high seat pillars overboard and promised to settle where the gods decided to bring them ashore. Two of his slaves then searched the coasts for three years before finding the pillars in the small bay which eventually became the site of Reykjavík.

In the meantime, Hjörleifr had been murdered by his Irish slaves. Ingólfr hunted them down and killed them in the Westman Islands. The islands got their name from that event, with &quot;westmen&quot; (Old Norse: &quot;vestmenn&quot;) being a name that the Norsemen used for the Irish. Ingólfr was said to have settled a large part of southwestern Iceland, although after his settlement nothing more was known of him.

His son, Þorsteinn Ingólfsson, was a major chieftain and was said to have founded the , the first thing, or parliament, in Iceland. It was a forerunner of the Althingi.

==Legacy==
In 1924, a statue of Ingólfr Arnarson, designed by Icelandic sculptor Einar Jónsson (1874–1954), was erected in Reykjavík. A copy of the statue was erected at Rivedal in 1961.

<text>Irish set dancing, sometimes called &quot;Irish sets&quot;, is a popular form of folk dancing in Ireland danced to Irish tunes in groups of eight or four dancers. It is also sometime named set dance, but this name refers more often to a kind of dance in Irish stepdance.

==History==
Set dancing is based on quadrilles, which were court dances. These were transformed by the Irish into a unique folk dance of the Irish rural communities.

When the Gaelic League was formed in 1897, it sought to discourage set dancing, because it was perceived as being of foreign origins, and consequently at odds with the League&#x27;s nationalist agenda. In its place, the League promoted ceili dance, a process which continued during the 1930s and 1940s with the support of the Catholic Church in the form of the Public Dance Halls Act 1935. The rise of rock and roll in the 1950s caused the popularity of set dancing to fade. However, in the 1980s a revival started and many sets that have not been done for forty years or more are being recovered and danced again.

As the sets were often shown in special competitions under a choregraphied form (three or four figures had to be chosen to dance on the stage for instance), the popular version of the sets danced in the Céilí is often derived from this choreography and can be different from the original. For instance, the Connemara Reel Set was danced at first with only a reel figure and a jig figure. To be shown in competition it had to be truncated in more figures and now this is this version with three reel figures and a jig figure which is danced in the céilithe.

==The Set==
To start, four couples are arranged in the form of a square to dance with each couple being in the middle of the sides of the square. Both the eight dancers in the group and the dance itself are called a &quot;set&quot;. The dance is a sequence of several dance figures, which usually have a common theme or structure. The figures usually begin and end with repeated parts that everyone dances, and then during the figure each couple or pair of couples will dance separately. In the set, the couple with their backs to the band are traditionally named &quot;First Tops&quot; with &quot;Second Tops&quot; facing them. The couple on First Tops left hand side is called &quot;First Sides&quot; with &quot;Second Sides&quot; facing. Usually the First Tops are the first to dance, with some sets having First Sides and then Second Tops going next and some having Second Tops and then the First Sides. Second Sides is almost always the last couple to dance, and is therefore a good place for beginners to start, as they get more time to watch the demonstrations of the figure that the other couples give.

Sets from a particular region usually have similar elements. For instance, sets from the Connemara region (such as the &quot;Connemara Reel Set&quot;, the &quot;South Galway Reel Set&quot; and the &quot;Claddagh Set&quot;) have the First Sides on the right of the First Tops, and sets from the Clare region often involve footwork similar to Irish traditional Stepdance or traditional freeform Sean-nós dance (which emphasizes a &quot;battering&quot; step).

Distinctive sets and dance regions emerged in the course of the 19th century and evolved as popular house dances separate from the more formal Irish step-dancing tradition. In some homesteads a kitchen pot was placed under the flag stones as an extra acoustical element for the house dance.

Sets differs from square dance and round dance in that it does not require a caller: the sequence of figures is predefined by the name of the set. In places with a large community of set dancers, like Ireland or New York City, it is usual for dances to be uncalled - that is, done with no calling - because most dancers already know the instructions for the common sets. However, at venues with larger numbers of occasional dancers, or for an unaccustomed or new set, a caller is often present to give instructions as the dance progresses, for those people who are not yet familiar with the set.

<doc id="454896" wikidata="Q337748" url="?curid=454896" title="Grignard reaction">
<text>The Grignard reaction () is an organometallic chemical reaction in which, according to the classical definition, carbon alkyl, allyl, vinyl, or aryl magnesium halides (Grignard reagent) are added to the carbonyl groups of either an aldehyde or ketone under anhydrous conditions. This reaction is important for the formation of carbon–carbon bonds.

==History and definitions==
Grignard reactions and reagents were discovered by and are named after the French chemist François Auguste Victor Grignard (University of Nancy, France), who described them in 1900. He was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. 

The reaction of an organic halide with magnesium is &quot;not&quot; a Grignard reaction, but provides a Grignard reagent. 

Classically, the Grignard reaction refers to the reaction between a ketone or aldehyde group with a Grignard reagent to form a primary or tertiary alcohol. However, some chemists understand the definition to mean all reactions of any electrophiles with Grignard reagents. Therefore, there is some dispute about the modern definition of the Grignard reaction. In the &quot;Merck Index&quot;, published online by the Royal Society of Chemistry, the classical definition is acknowledged, followed by &quot;A more modern interpretation extends the scope of the reaction to include the addition of Grignard reagents to a wide variety of electrophilic substrates.&quot; This variety of definitions illustrates that there is some dispute within the chemistry community about the definition of a Grignard reaction. 

Shown below are some reactions involving Grignard reagents, but they themselves are not classically understood as Grignard reactions.
==Reaction mechanism==

Because carbon is more electronegative than magnesium, the carbon attached to magnesium acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom in the polar bond of a carbonyl group. The addition of the Grignard reagent to the carbonyl group typically proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state, as shown below.

Based on the detection of radical coupling side products, an alternative single electron transfer (SET) mechanism that involves the initial formation of a ketyl radical intermediate has also been proposed. A recent computational study suggests that the operative mechanism (polar vs. radical) is substrate-dependent, with the reduction potential of the carbonyl compound serving as a key parameter.

==Conditions==

The Grignard reaction is conducted under anhydrous conditions. Otherwise, the reaction will fail because the Grignard reagent will act as a base rather than a nucleophile and pick up a labile proton rather than attacking the electrophilic site. This will result in no formation of the desired product as the R-group of the Grignard reagent will become protonated while the MgX portion will stabilize the deprotonated species. 

To prevent this, Grignard reactions are completed in an inert atmosphere to remove all water from the reaction flask and ensure that the desired product is formed. Additionally, if there are acidic protons in the starting material, as shown in the figure on the right, one can overcome this by protecting the acidic site of the reactant by turning it into an ether or a silyl ether to eliminate the labile proton from the solution prior to the Grignard reaction.

==Variants==
Other variations of the Grignard reagent have been discovered to improve the chemoselectivity of the Grignard reaction, which include but are not limited to: Turbo-Grignards, organocerium reagents, and organocuprate (Gilman) reagents.

===Turbo-Grignards===
Turbo-Grignards are Grignard reagents modified with lithium chloride. Compared to conventional Grignard reagents, Turbo-Grignards are more chemoselective; esters, amides, and nitriles do not react with the Turbo-Grignard reagent.
===Heterometal-modified Grignard reagents===

The behavior of Grignard reagents can be usefully modified in the present of other metals. Copper(I) salts give
organocuprates that preferentially effect 1,4 addition. Cerium trichloride allows selective 1,2-additions to the same substrates. Nickel and palladium halides catalyze cross coupling reactions.

<text>A signaling gateway is a network component responsible for transferring signaling messages (i.e. information related to call establishment, billing, location, short messages, address conversion, and other services) between Common Channel Signaling (CCS) nodes that communicate using different protocols and transports. Transport conversion is often from SS7 to IP. 

A SIGTRAN Signaling Gateway is a network component that performs packet level translation of signaling from common channel signaling (based upon SS7) to SIGTRAN signaling (based upon IP). The concept of the SIGTRAN signaling gateway was introduced in the IETF document: RFC 2719: Architectural Framework for Signaling Transport.

A signaling gateway can be implemented as an embedded component of some other network element, or can be provided as a stand-alone network element. For example: a signaling gateway is often part of a softswitch in modern VoIP deployments. The signaling gateway function can also be included within the larger operational domain of a Signal Transfer Point (STP). 

Protocol conversion gateways can also convert from one network operational paradigm to another – for example, SIP to ISUP for call control, SIP to TCAP for address translation, or SIP to MAP for location or presence.

<doc id="454903" wikidata="Q113838" url="?curid=454903" title="Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Uhu">
<text>The Focke-Wulf Fw 189 &quot;Uhu&quot; (Owl) is a twin-engine twin-boom tactical reconnaissance and army cooperation aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf. It was one of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s most prominent short range reconnaissance aircraft during the Second World War.

The Fw 189 was developed during the late 1930s to fulfil a specification issued by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) for an advanced short-range reconnaissance aircraft to succeed the Henschel Hs 126 in the tactical support role provided by the Luftwaffe to the Wehrmacht. While Arado Flugzeugwerke (Arado) had responded with the conventional Arado Ar 198, Focke-Wulf&#x27;s design team, headed by the aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank, produced the unconventional Fw 189, a twin-boom aircraft with a central crew gondola with a glazed stepless cockpit. During July 1938, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; early testing of the Fw 189 demonstrated its superiority over the Ar 198, and thus the RLM backed its development and subsequent quantity production.

During 1940, the Fw 189 entered service with the Luftwaffe. It was much in use on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union, where it was used for reconnaissance role, a light bomber and a night fighter. The Fw 189 was also used on other fronts. Production of the type took place at the Focke-Wulf factory at Bremen, the Bordeaux-Merignac aircraft factory in occupied France, and the Aero Vodochody aircraft factory in Prague, occupied Czechoslovakia. Further development and production of the type continued until mid-1944, at which point production was terminated to concentrate on fighters.

==Design and development==
Work on what would become the Fw 189 can be traced back to February 1937 and the issuing of a specification by the German &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) that called for a short-range reconnaissance aircraft that had a three-man crew and provided all-round visibility; it was also specified that the aircraft should possess about of power. An important function of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was to provide tactical support to the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;; the envisioned aircraft was intended to be an advanced successor to the Henschel Hs 126, which had only just started service trials. This specification was issued to both Arado and Focke-Wulf.

Arado opted to respond with the relatively conventional Ar 198, which was a single-engined high-wing monoplane with a glazed gondola underneath the fuselage. Focke-Wulf&#x27;s chief designer Kurt Tank had opted for a distinctive twin-boom configuration for what would become the Fw 189; it was also powered by a pair of Argus As 410 engines instead of the expected single engine. As a &quot;twin-boom&quot; design, akin to the earlier Dutch Fokker G.I, the Fw 189 used a central crew gondola, which for the Fw 189 would be designed with a glazed and framed stepless cockpit forward section, which used no separate windscreen panels for the pilot (as with many German medium bombers from 1938). The Fw 189 had as part of its defensive armament, a novel rear-gun emplacement designed by the Ikaria-Werke: a rotating conical rear &quot;turret&quot; of sorts, manually rotated with a metal-framed, glazed conical fairing streamlining its shape, with the open section providing the firing aperture for either a single or twin machine-gun at the unit&#x27;s circular-section forward mount. Blohm &amp; Voss proposed as a private venture something even more radical, chief designer Dr. Richard Vogt&#x27;s unique asymmetric Blohm &amp; Voss BV 141.

The BV 141 and Fw 189 submissions were reportedly received by RLM officials with a degree of unease due to their unconventional approaches. During April 1937, orders were placed for three prototypes each of the Arado and Focke-Wulf designs. That month, construction of the first prototype Fw 189 commenced. In July 1938, it performed its maiden flight, the pilot being Tank. The aircraft possessed favourable flight characteristics. One month later, it was followed by the second prototype, the principal difference between the two being that the second prototype was armed, carrying two MG 17 and three MG 15 machine guns along with underwing bombracks capable of carrying up to four bombs. The third prototype was outfitted with specially-designed Argus variable-pitch propeller that automatically changed pitch via the vanes on the spinner. In contrast to the smooth testing of the Fw 189, the Ar 198 exhibited comparatively cumbersome and unsatisfactory performance.

Recognising the Fw 189 as the winner, Focke-Wulf received a development contract from the RLM for four additional prototypes. The first of these four aircraft was representative of the production standard Fw 189A, being powered by a pair of Argus As 410A-1 V-12 inverted piston engines, capable of generating up to and a reduced defensive armament comprising only two machine guns. The next aircraft prototype was a forerunner of the Fw 189B, featuring more refined aerodynamic shaping of the fuselage along with a more conventional stepped cockpit. In mid 1939, the RLM ordered another 13 aircraft, all of which were delivered to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; by March 1940.

During late 1939, Focke-Wulf withdrew the first prototype from the flight test programme to adapt it into their response to a request from the RLM for a dedicated close air support aircraft. The original fuselage nacelle was replaced by a compact armoured counterpart; largely due to the increased weight, it handled poorly. While this version was formally evaluated, the competing Henschel Hs 129 was selected instead, partly due to its smaller size and reduced production cost.

The Fw 189 was mass produced at the Focke-Wulf factory in Bremen, at the Bordeaux-Merignac aircraft factory (Avions Marcel Bloch&#x27;s factory, which became Dassault Aviation after the war) in occupied France and at the Aero Vodochody aircraft factory in Prague, occupied Czechoslovakia. By mid-1942, production of the Fw 189 at Bremen had ended as resources were concentrated on the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter instead. While the company&#x27;s design team continued to work on advanced variants of the Fw 189 into early 1944, production of the type was permanently ended in mid-1944 in response to Germany&#x27;s declining military situation, which compelled the termination of various aircraft programmes to concentrate resources. Total production of the type came to 864 aircraft of all variants.

==Operational history==
During early 1940, Luftwaffe pilots commenced training on the type, initially using the pre-production Fw 189s exclusively and supplemented by five-seat Fw 189B-1 trainers from the summer of 1940. While operational trials of the type were quite successful, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; officials concluded that there was little advantage to withdrawing the existing Hs 126s in favour of Fw 189s. Instead, the service decided to introduce the type relatively slowly, thus the Fw 189 was not operational at any meaningful quantity until the summer of 1942. This delay did allow for some refinements to the aircraft, particularly its airframe, to be performed during 1941; modifications around this time included desert survival gear and floats. The first unit to re-equip with the type being on the Eastern Front.

Called the (Flying Eye) of the German Army, the Fw 189 was used extensively on the Eastern Front. By September 1942, 172 Fw 189s were reportedly operational on this front, making up the majority of all short range reconnaissance aircraft present. It was nicknamed &quot;Rama&quot; (&quot;frame&quot; in the Russian, Ukrainian and Polish languages) by Soviet forces, referring to its distinctive tail boom, fin and elevator shapes, giving it a quadrangular appearance. Despite its low speed and fragile looks, the Fw 189&#x27;s manoeuvrability made it a difficult target for Soviet fighters. The Fw 189 was often able to out-turn attacking fighters by flying in a tight circle into which enemy fighters could not follow. The Fw 189 also saw service on other fronts, including the Middle East.

Night Reconnaissance Group 15, attached to the 4th &quot;Panzerarmee&quot; in southern Poland during late 1944, carried out nocturnal reconnaissance and light bombing sorties with a handful of Fw 189A-1s. These aircraft typically lacked the main machine gun. Small numbers of A-1s were used as night fighters in the closing weeks of the conflict – the aircraft were modified by having their reconnaissance equipment removed and then fitted with FuG 212 AI radar in the nose and a single obliquely-firing 20 mm MG FF autocannon in the common &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; upwards/forward-firing offensive fitment also used for heavier German night fighters, like the Bf 110G. For the Fw 189 the installation was in the crew nacelle in the space where the rear dorsal gun was normally housed. The majority of the &quot;nachtjager&quot; Fw 189s was operated by NJG 100, were based at Greifswald. Chronic fuel shortages and enemy air superiority over the Fw 189 defence area (chiefly Berlin) meant that few aircraft were shot down by these aircraft.

==Variants==
The main production model was the Fw 189A reconnaissance plane, built mostly in two variants, the A-1 and A-2. Unless otherwise stated all aircraft were powered by two Argus As 410 engines of 465 PS (459 hp, 342 kW).
* Fw 189A-0: Ten preproduction aircraft for operational tests and trials.
* Fw 189A-1: Initial production version, armed with two flexible 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine guns in the dorsal and rear positions, one 7.92 mm (0.312 in) MG 17 machine gun in each wing root, plus four bombs. It could carry an Rb 20/30 or an Rb 50/30 aerial camera.
* Fw 189A-1 trop: Tropicalised version of the Fw 189 A-1, fitted with air intake filters and survival equipment. Conversion from A-1s.

* Fw 189A-1/U2: VIP transport version of the Fw 189 A-1.
* Fw 189A-1/U3: VIP transport version of the Fw 189 A-1.
* Fw 189A-2: The flexible MG 15s were replaced by twin-barrel 7.92 mm (0.312 in) MG 81Z.
* Fw 189A-3: Tropicalised production version of the Fw 189 A-2, fitted with air intake filters and survival equipment.
* Fw 189A-4: Light ground-attack version, armed with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in each wing root, fitted with armour protection for the underside of the fuselage, engines and fuel tanks. No production known.

The Fw 189B was a five-seat training aircraft; only 13 were built.
* Fw 189B-0: Three preproduction aircraft.
* Fw 189B-1: Five-seat training version. ten built.

The Fw 189C was conceived as a heavily armoured ground-attack, close-support variant, in competition with the Henschel Hs 129. But its two prototypes (&quot;V1b&quot; and &quot;V6&quot;) were not satisfactory, and it was not produced.
* Fw 189D: Proposed twin-float trainer floatplane. Not built.
* Fw 189E: Prototype only, powered by two 700 PS (690 hp, 515 kW) Gnome-Rhone 14M radial engines.
* Fw 189F-1: Re-engined Fw 189 A-1 aircraft, powered by two 600 PS (592 hp, 441 kW) Argus As 411 engines.
* Fw 189F-2: Fitted with electrically operated landing gear, increased fuel capacity and additional armour plating, powered by two 600 PS (592 hp, 441 kW) Argus As 411 engines.

==Surviving aircraft==
Fw 189 &quot;V7+1H&quot; (&quot;Werk Nr. 2100&quot;) is the only surviving Fw 189. It was part of 1./&quot;Nahaufklärungsgruppe 10&quot;, with V7 originally the &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; code for Heeres-Aufklärungsgruppe 32 based at Pontsalenjoki (due east of Kuusamo, and within the south-central area of modern Russia&#x27;s Republic of Karelia) and took part in its first mission on 4 May 1943. The mission was to photograph the Loukhi-3 airbase from an altitude of , then to continue north along the Murmansk-Leningrad railway. Approximately 31 minutes after taking off &quot;V7+1H&quot; was attacked and damaged by Lend-Lease-acquired Soviet Hawker Hurricane fighters. The aircraft dived to escape the fighters, but, owing to the damage suffered, could not pull out in time and it struck the treetops. The tail was torn off and the crew nacelle left hanging upside down within the trees. The pilot, Lothar Mothes, survived but one crewman was killed in the crash and the third died from blood loss as a result of a severed leg. Mothes survived two weeks in sub-zero temperatures, evading Soviet patrols while eating bark and grubs as he walked back to his base. He spent the next nine months in a hospital recovering from severe frostbite before returning to the front line, eventually to fly another 100 missions.

In 1991 the wreckage of &quot;V7+1H&quot; was found in the Russian forest where it had remained for 48 years. The aircraft was purchased by a group of British aircraft enthusiasts and was shipped to the United Kingdom, arriving at Worthing, West Sussex in March 1992. The Focke Wulf 189 Restoration Society was formed to restore the aircraft to flying condition. Her former pilot, Lothar Mothes, met up again with his aircraft at the 1996 Biggin Hill Airshow.

It was reported that this aircraft was acquired by Paul Allen&#x27;s Flying Heritage Collection and was in rebuild at Duxford to an airworthy condition, but as of August 1, 2021 was listed for sale.

<text>Step dance is a generic term for dance styles in which footwork is considered to be the most important part of the dance and limb movements and styling are either restricted or considered irrelevant.

Step-dancing is a percussive form of dance that employs hard-soled shoes and is synchronized with music played at a specified tempo using instruments like pipes, whistles, fiddles, or puirt-a-beul (mouth music). It entails producing rhythmic beats through intricate and diverse footwork, involving striking heels, toes, and feet, all the while ensuring impeccable timing with the musical rhythms found in strathspey, reel, and jig compositions.

The terminology used in percussive dance styles reflects a wide range of naming conventions, highlighting both shared features and unique distinctions. The umbrella term &quot;percussive dance&quot; encompasses dance forms where the foot serves as an intentional source of rhythmic sound, akin to a percussion instrument. The specific footwear associated with each style contributes to variations within this genre.

While &quot;percussive dance&quot; is the overarching term, colloquially, &quot;step dance&quot; is commonly used. However, nuances exist in the application of this term across different communities. For example, in the Ottawa Valley tradition, the preferred term is &quot;step-dancing&quot; rather than &quot;step dance&quot;. In Scotland, both &quot;step dance&quot; and &quot;step-dancing&quot; are recognized. The Irish-Newfoundland style may be referred to as either &quot;Irish-Newfoundland step dance&quot; or &quot;Irish-Newfoundland tap&quot;. In Métis and certain aboriginal communities, the practice is often known as &quot;jigging&quot;, and in French, the dance form is called &quot;la gigue&quot;.

== Clog dancing ==
Step dancing includes clog dancing in which the steps are performed by performers wearing clogs. The sound of the clogs against a hard surface produces a characteristic sound which is an important element of the dance.

== Cape Breton step dance ==
The traditional Cape Breton step dance, reminiscent of the style brought by 19th-century Scottish immigrants, is characterized by its exceptional precision. Throughout the dance, the feet stay close to the floor, executing each step with unwavering accuracy, ensuring no beats are missed. The repertoire consists of concise, symmetrical steps, with each foot taking precise positions. In contrast, contemporary Cape Breton step dance blends influences from various styles such as Irish, tap, Acadian, and Ottawa Valley step dance. These modern versions depart from the traditional precision, incorporating &quot;offbeat&quot; steps that don&#x27;t strictly adhere to a four or eight-bar musical phrase. Additionally, asymmetrical elements introduce subtle divergences between the movements of each foot, deviating from the mirrored actions seen in the conventional dance form. The Cape Breton step dance is distinguished by its unique musical accompaniment, particularly the exceptional rendition of the strathspey performed skillfully by acclaimed Cape Breton fiddlers like Carl MacKenzie and Howie MacDonald. The heart of Cape Breton step dancing is closely linked to the captivating interplay of the &quot;drive and the lift&quot; inherent in the Cape Breton strathspey. What sets this dance apart from similar step dances globally is the incorporation of the Cape Breton-style strathspey, a musical expression less commonly found in other Celtic regions where jigs and reels are more prevalent. In present-day Cape Breton step dance, the vibrant melodies of the fiddle, accompanied by the piano, play a central role, marking a shift from an earlier period when the dance tradition was primarily influenced by the piping tradition.

== Irish step dance ==
Irish stepdance is a widespread form of step dance. The earliest &quot;feis&quot;, or competition, occurred in 1897. It descends from traditional Irish dance, but global popularity of the Riverdance troupe significantly altered its competitive form from traditional Irish standards. Both traditional and more modern competitive styles are characterized by the use of specific shoes and by costumes that can be remarkably elaborate. Irish stepdance is, as of 2017, the only form of step dance to which a Broadway production, &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;, has been devoted.

== Other forms of step dance ==
Tap dancing is a modern form of step dancing taking its influence from a variety of older step-forms.

A traditional form of individual step dancing is still found in certain areas of England such as East Anglia and Dartmoor. This style of dance is commonly performed informally in pubs to traditional folk tunes, with dancers often bringing a wooden board to dance on.

Step dancing (&quot;stomping&quot;) can also be found in other countries such as Malambo from Argentina and Zapateado from Mexico.

== African-American stepping ==
Another form of step dancing, stepping, has been popularized by National Pan-Hellenic Council. This step dance has African roots and is an African American tradition as well as part of black history. The members of the fraternities and sororities join in steps—elaborate synchronized group routines that are performed in competitions between the fraternities and sororities called &quot;step shows&quot;. Step shows incorporate cheerleading, military, and drill-team moves, especially the call-and-response element inherent in those forms. These aspects are not only important to the energy of stepping for entertainment use but also for bonding and pride within their organizations.

<doc id="454907" wikidata="Q2604326" url="?curid=454907" title="Slip jig">
<text>Slip jig () refers to both a style within Irish music, and the Irish dance to music in slip-jig time originating from England. The slip jig is in time, traditionally with accents on 5 of the 9 beats — two pairs of crotchet/quaver (quarter note/eighth note) followed by a dotted crotchet note.

The slip jig is one of the four most common Irish stepdances, the others being the reel, the jig and the hornpipe. It is danced in soft shoes. At one time only men danced it, then for several decades only women, and today slip jigs can be danced by any dancer, though at a competitive level they are almost exclusively danced by women. This dance is graceful and controlled, with heels very high, often called &quot;the ballet of Irish dance&quot;. There are also traditional Irish &quot;céilí&quot; dances which are slip jigs, though these are much less common than reels and double jigs.

Because of its timing, the slip jig is longer than the reel for the same number of bars of music. In Irish stepdance competition, the tempo of 113 beats per minute is the same as other dances, but as each bar is longer, instead of dancing to 48 bars of music the dancer is only required to dance 40 bars of music (each of 2 steps). Stepdance judges prefer sliding motions with the feet and graceful movements that seem to slip across the floor.

Slip jig timing can also be used for &quot;strip the willow&quot; dances in céilidh folk dance, although the fact that most social dancers do not dance the step limits its use in set dance and ceili dance socially. The tunes are fast-paced and lively in contrast to the slower Irish stepdance tunes.

==Example==
