<text>Herto Man refers to human remains (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) discovered in 1997 from the Upper Herto member of the Bouri Formation in the Afar Triangle, Ethiopia. The remains have been dated as between 154,000 and 160,000 years old. The discovery of Herto Man was especially significant at the time, falling within a long gap in the fossil record between 300 and 100 thousand years ago and representing the oldest dated &quot;H. sapiens&quot; remains then described.

In the original description paper, these 12 (at minimum) individuals were described as falling just outside the umbrella of &quot;anatomically modern human&quot;. Thus, Herto Man was classified into a new subspecies as &quot;Homo sapiens idaltu&quot; ( &quot;elder&quot;). It supposedly represented a transitional morph between the more archaic &quot;H. (s.?) rhodesiensis&quot; and &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot; (that is, a stage in a chronospecies). Subsequent researchers have rejected this classification. The validity of such subspecies is difficult to justify because of the vague definitions of &quot;species&quot; and &quot;subspecies&quot;, especially when discussing a chronospecies, as the exact end-morphology and start-morphology of the ancestor and descendant species are inherently unresolvable.

Herto Man produced many stone tools which can fit into the vaguely defined &quot;Transitional Acheulean&quot;, the long-lasting cultural tradition with both characteristically Acheulean (made by archaic humans) and Middle Stone Age (made by modern humans) tools. They seem to have been butchering mainly hippo, but also bovines, in a lakeside environment. The three most complete skulls (one a 6- to 7-year-old child) bear manmade cut marks and other alterations, which could be evidence of mortuary practices like excarnation.

==Research history==
===Discovery===

Fossils of Herto Man were first recovered in 1997 from the Upper Herto Member of the Bouri Formation in the Middle Awash site of the Afar Triangle, Ethiopia. The materials are: BOU-VP-16/1, a nearly complete skull missing the left skullcap; BOU-VP-16/2, skull fragments; BOU-VP-16/3, a parietal bone fragment; BOU-VP-16/4, a parietal fragment; BOU-VP-16/5, a nearly complete skull of a 6- or 7-year old; BOU-VP-16/6, a right upper molar; BOU-VP-16/7, a parietal fragment; BOU-VP-16/18, parietal fragments; BOU-VP-16/42, an upper premolar; and BOU-VP-16/43, a parietal fragment. Further excavation has yielded a total of 12 individuals.

This region of the world is famous for yielding a series of ancient human and hominin species stretching as far back as 6 million years. In 2003, using argon–argon dating, the Upper Herto Member was dated to 160 to 154 thousand years ago. The Herto Man was a major fossil find as, at the time, there was a significant gap in the human fossil record between 300 and 100 thousand years ago, obfuscating the evolution of &quot;Homo (sapiens?) rhodesiensis&quot; into &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot;.

By the time Herto Man was discovered, based on genetic analyses and the fossil record after 120,000 years ago, it was largely agreed that modern humans &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot; evolved in Africa (recent African origin model), but it was debated if this was a continent-wide or localised process. In regard to the localised model, the antiquity of the Herto Man and the several similar specimens of presumably equal or even older age distributed across East Africa shifted the focus to that region. In 2017, the Jebel Irhoud remains were dated to 315,000 years ago, making them the oldest specimens classified as &quot;H. sapiens&quot;. Because this date overlaps with &quot;&quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot;, the Irhoud remains also demonstrate that these transitional morphs, including Herto Man, represent a rapid evolution of the &quot;sapiens&quot; face, with gradual modifications to the braincase among populations distributed across Africa, beginning as early as 300,000 years ago.

===&quot;H. s. idaltu&quot;&quot;===
In a simultaneously published paper, anthropologists Tim D. White, Berhane Asfaw, David DeGusta, Henry Gilbert, Gary D. Richards, Gen Suwa, and Francis Clark Howell described the material as just barely outside what is considered an &quot;anatomically modern human&quot; (AMH), beyond the range of variation for any present-day human. They instead considered the earliest &quot;AMHs&quot; specimens from Klasies River Caves, South Africa, or Qafzeh cave, Israel. They did this by comparing BOU-VP-16/1 with the Qafzeh 6 skull, the La Ferrassie 1 skull (a male Neanderthal, &quot;H. (s.?) neanderthalensis&quot;), the Kabwe 1 skull (&quot;&quot;H. (s.?) rhodesiensis&quot;), and 28 present-day male skulls. Consequently, they classified Herto Man as a new palaeosubspecies of &quot;H. sapiens&quot; as &quot;H. s. idaltu&quot; (with the presumed male BOU-VP-16/1 as the holotype), which represents an intermediary morph between &quot;H. (s.?) rhodesiensis&quot;&quot; and present-day &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot;. The name comes from the local Afar language &quot;idàltu&quot; &quot;elder&quot;. Similarly transitional specimens (at the time, not well-dated) tentatively assigned to &quot;late archaic &quot;H. sapiens&quot;&quot; had been reported from Ngaloba, Tanzania; Omo, Ethiopia; Eliye Springs, Kenya; and Jebel Irhoud, Morocco.
In another simultaneously published paper, British physical anthropologist Chris Stringer doubted the validity of &quot;H. s. idaltu&quot;, saying the material was similar to some Late Pleistocene Australasian specimens. White &quot;et al.&quot; made note of this, but still considered Herto Man &quot;clearly distinct&quot;. In 2011, American anthropologists Kyle Lubsen and Robert Corruccini compared BOU-VP-16/1 with Skhul 5 from Es-Skhul Cave, Israel (temporally close to the Qafzeh material), and instead reported these two skulls are closely allied with each other. That is, their analysis found no support for Herto Man&#x27;s position as a transitional morph, nor the nomen &quot;idaltu&quot;. In 2014, anthropologists Robert McCarthy and Lynn Lucas considered a much larger sample than White &quot;et al.&quot;—using several specimens representing &quot;archaic &quot;Homo&quot;&quot;, Neanderthal, &quot;early modern &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot;&quot;, and Late Pleistocene &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot;—and arrived at the same conclusion as Lubsen and Corruccini. Citing these two studies, in 2016, Stringer, in his review of literature regarding the derivation of &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot;, said the name &quot;idaltu&quot;, &quot;does not seem justified.&quot;

The main issue of palaeosubspecies validity lies in the vague definitions of &quot;species&quot; and &quot;subspecies&quot;, especially when discussing a chronospecies (an unbroken lineage which gradually changes, making the exact end-morphology and start-morphology of the ancestor and descendant species unresolvable). The original describers in 2019 still upheld the name &quot;H. s. idaltu&quot; because their argument, &quot;depended largely on discrete traits,&quot; whereas Mcarthy and Lucas, &quot;focused only on the gross cranial metrics&quot;, but also stated debating the exact taxonomic names and labels is overall not as important as understanding trends in human evolution.

==Anatomy==

Like what could be considered an &quot;anatomically modern human&quot;, the Herto skull has a high cranial vault (a raised forehead), an overall globular shape in side-view, and a flat face. The brain volume was about 1,450 cc. The skull is quite robust in having a projecting brow ridge, weakly curved parietal bones, and a strongly flexed occipital at the back of the skull. These traits are well within the range of variation of modern humans. Compared to the average present-day human skull, the Herto skull is notably long and has overall large dimensions, although the cheekbones are relatively weak.

==Culture==
===Technology===
The Upper Herto Member is a sandy fluvial (deposited by rivers) unit recording a freshwater lake environment, and has yielded archaeologically relevant remains across a stretch. Locality BOU-A19 preserved 71 artefacts, BOU-A26 331 artefacts, and BOU-A29 194 artefacts, a total of 640. Additionally, BOU-A19B has 29 artefacts, and BOU-A19H 15 artefacts. The tool assemblage contains tools made using the Levallois technique (associated with the African &quot;Middle Stone Age&quot;), as well as cleavers and other bifaces (associated with the earlier Acheulean). Though bifaces and blades are rare (respectively less than 5% and 1% of the tools), it is more likely these tools were frequently made by Herto Man at a different location than that they were indeed rarely produced at all. Such an assemblage is typically labelled as the vaguely defined &quot;Transitional Acheulean&quot;, which is found as far back as 280,000 years ago. The Herto site thus indicates the transitional phase was long-lived, and the actual derivation of what is considered &quot;Middle Stone Age&quot; proper was not gradual nor simple.
Points and blades were made with obsidian, and other tools with fine-grained basalt, though a few scrapers were made with cryptocrystalline rock. Of the pool of 640, 48 flakes, blades, and points were made with the Levallois technique. The 28 bifaces include ovates, elongate ovates, triangulars, cleavers, and a pick, scraper, and biface core. All 17 handaxes were made with flakes and finished with soft hammering. Out of the 25 side scrapers, 22 were simple (only one side could scrape). There were 15 end-scrapers (only one or both of the ends could scrape), and a few were rounded off, somewhat resembling Aurignacian (40,000 years ago) end-scrapers.

Both the Lower and Upper Herto Members preserve several bovine and hippo carcasses with manmade cut marks, recording a long-lasting butchering tradition with a predilection for hippo. One location records the accumulation of numerous hippo calves (newborn to a few weeks old) and adults.

===Mortuary practices===
The adult BOU-VP-16/1 shows a weak, thin vertical cut on the bottom corner of his right parietal bone, and another smaller vertical line across the right temporal line. The adult BOU-VP-16/2 bears intense modification of 15 of his 24 associated skullcap fragments, as well as deep cut marks consistent with defleshing on his parietals, left cheekbone, frontal bone, and occipital bone. BOU-VP-16/2 also presents evidence of repetitive scraping around the circumference of the braincase (generally interpreted as a symbolic modification rather than for consumption), and the lack of fragments from the base of the skull may mean the specimen was deposited as an isolated skullcap to begin with. The juvenile BOU-VP-16/5 has deep cut marks consistent with defleshing all along the undersides of the sphenoid and temporal bones, likely after the jawbone was removed. The occipital bone and foramen magnum (the base of the skull) were broken into, and the edges were polished and smoothed off, which is similar to the mortuary practices of some Papuan tribes. These could indicate that Herto Man was symbolically preparing the dead in some mortuary ritual.

<doc id="446394" wikidata="Q860129" url="?curid=446394" title="Charging Bull">
<text>Charging Bull (sometimes referred to as the Bull of Wall Street or the Bowling Green Bull) is a bronze sculpture that stands on Broadway just north of Bowling Green in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City. The bronze sculpture, standing tall and measuring long, depicts a bull, the symbol of financial optimism and prosperity. &quot;Charging Bull&quot; is a popular tourist destination that draws thousands of people a day, symbolizing Wall Street and the Financial District.

The sculpture was created by Italian artist Arturo Di Modica in the wake of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. Late in the evening of Thursday, December 14, 1989, Di Modica arrived on Wall Street with &quot;Charging Bull&quot; on the back of a truck and illegally dropped the sculpture outside of the New York Stock Exchange Building. After being removed by the New York City Police Department later that day, &quot;Charging Bull&quot; was installed at Bowling Green on December 20, 1989. Despite initially having only a temporary permit to be located at Bowling Green, &quot;Charging Bull&quot; became a popular tourist attraction. Di Modica may have been influenced by a pair of huge metallic sculptures, a charging bull and a bear, placed in front of the Frankfurt, Germany Stock Exchange in 1985 as part of the 400th celebration of the exchange.

Following the success of the original sculpture, Di Modica created a number of variations of the &quot;Charging Bull&quot; which have been sold to private collectors. &quot;Charging Bull&quot; has been a subject of criticism from an anti-capitalist perspective, such as in the Occupy Wall Street protests of 2011, and has also been compared to the biblical golden calf worshiped by the Israelites shortly after their Exodus from Egypt.

==Description==
The sculpture is in a cobblestone-paved traffic median of Broadway just north of Bowling Green. The sculpture is adjacent to 26 Broadway to the east and 25 Broadway to the west. It stands tall and measures long. It depicts a bull, the symbol of financial optimism and prosperity, leaning back on its haunches and with its head lowered as if ready to charge. The sculpture is both a popular tourist destination, which draws thousands of people a day, as well as a symbol of Wall Street and the Financial District, being described as &quot;one of the most iconic images of New York&quot; and a &quot;Wall Street icon.&quot; Children also frequently climb the sculpture.

In &quot;Outdoor Monuments of Manhattan: A Historical Guide&quot;, Dianne Durante describes the sculpture:
The &quot;Bull&quot;″s head is lowered, its nostrils flare, and its wickedly long, sharp horns are ready to gore; it&#x27;s an angry, dangerous beast. The muscular body twists to one side, and the tail is curved like a lash: the &quot;Bull&quot; is also energetic and in motion.

The bronze color and hard, metallic texture of the sculpture&#x27;s surface emphasize the brute force of the creature. The work was designed and placed so that viewers could walk around it, which also suggests the creature&#x27;s own movement is unrestricted — a point reinforced by the twisting posture of the bull&#x27;s body, according to Durante.

&quot;Charging Bull&quot;, then, shows an aggressive or even belligerent force on the move, but unpredictably...[I]t&#x27;s not far-fetched to say the theme is the energy, strength, and unpredictability of the stock market.

Di Modica told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in 1998:
That bull is one of an edition of five...I&#x27;m hoping the other four will be going to cities all over the world, whenever somebody buys them.

==History==
===Construction and installation===

The bull was cast by the Bedi-Makky Art Foundry in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Di Modica spent $360,000 to create, cast, and install the sculpture following the 1987 stock market crash. The sculpture was Di Modica&#x27;s idea. Having arrived penniless in the United States in 1970, Di Modica felt indebted to the nation for welcoming him and enabling his career as a successful sculptor. &quot;Charging Bull&quot; was intended to inspire each person who came into contact with it to carry on fighting through the hard times after the 1987 stock market crash. Di Modica later recounted to art writer Anthony Haden-Guest, &quot;My point was to show people that if you want to do something in a moment things are very bad, you can do it. You can do it by yourself. My point was that you must be strong.&quot;

Another artist, Domenico Ranieri, enlarged the model of the bull and worked with Di Modica to bring out the fine points of the sculpture. In an act of guerrilla art, Bedi-Makky Art Foundry and Di Modica trucked it to Lower Manhattan. Late in the evening of December 14, 1989, they installed it beneath a Christmas tree in the middle of Broad Street in front of the New York Stock Exchange Building as a Christmas gift to New Yorkers. That day, hundreds of onlookers stopped to see it as Di Modica handed out copies of a flier about his artwork.

NYSE officials called police later that day, and the NYPD seized the sculpture and placed it into an impound lot. The ensuing public outcry led the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to reinstall it two blocks south of the Exchange, in Bowling Green, facing up Broadway just north of Whitehall Street. &quot;Charging Bull&quot; was rededicated at its new location with a ceremony on December 21, 1989.

===Ownership===
The sculpture technically has a temporary permit allowing it to stand on city property since the city does not own the sculpture, but the temporary permission has lasted since 1989, when city officials said the new location would not be permanent. Art on loan is usually limited to a year&#x27;s display, and although the city does not buy art, it does accept donations. By 1993, Di Modica wanted to sell the statue to recover the $320,000 cost of manufacturing it. However, there was only one major bid for the statue: a hotel in Las Vegas that offered $300,000.

A writer in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote in 1998 that the statue&#x27;s placement was &quot;beginning to look a mite permanent.&quot; According to an article in &quot;Art Monthly&quot;, Di Modica, as well as officials and New Yorkers, &quot;view it as a permanent feature of Lower Manhattan.&quot; In 2004, Di Modica announced that &quot;Charging Bull&quot; was for sale, on condition the buyer did not move it from its location. Joe Lewis, the British billionaire and ex-owner of Christies, purchased the sculpture.

Di Modica continued to own the artistic copyright to the statue, and filed several lawsuits against firms making replicas. For instance, Di Modica sued Wal-Mart and other companies in 2006 for selling replicas of the bull and using it in advertising campaigns. Three years later, Di Modica sued Random House for using a photo of the bull on the cover of a book discussing the collapse of financial services firm Lehman Brothers.

===Evolution into tourist attraction===
As soon as the sculpture was set up at Bowling Green, it became &quot;an instant hit.&quot; One of the city&#x27;s most photographed artworks, it has become a tourist destination in the Financial District. &quot;Its popularity is beyond doubt,&quot; an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the artwork. &quot;Visitors constantly pose for pictures around it.&quot; Henry J. Stern, the city parks commissioner when the statue first appeared in the Financial District, said in 1993: &quot;People are crazy about the bull. It captured their imagination.&quot; Adrian Benepe, a later New York City parks commissioner, said in 2004, &quot;It&#x27;s become one of the most visited, most photographed and perhaps most loved and recognized statues in the city of New York. I would say it&#x27;s right up there with the Statue of Liberty.&quot; A 2003 Bollywood film, &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;, featured &quot;Charging Bull&quot; in a musical number, one visitor told a reporter that the bull&#x27;s appearance in the film was a reason for his visit to New York City. Despite the financial crisis of 2007–2008, &quot;Charging Bull&quot; remained a popular tourist attraction.

In addition to having their pictures taken at the front end of the bull, many tourists pose at the back of the bull, near the large testicles &quot;for snapshots under an unmistakable symbol of its virility.&quot; According to a 2002 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;People on The Street say you&#x27;ve got to rub the nose, horns and testicles of the bull for good luck, tour guide Wayne McLeod would tell the group on the Baltimore bus, who would giddily oblige.&quot; A 2004 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Passers-by have rubbed—to a bright gleam—its nose, horns and a part of its anatomy that, as Mr. Benepe put it gingerly, &#x27;separates the bull from the steer.&#x27;&quot; A 2007 newspaper account agreed that a &quot;peculiar ritual&quot; of handling the &quot;shining orbs&quot; of the statue&#x27;s scrotum seems to have developed into a tradition.

On March 7, 2017, a bronze sculpture by Kristen Visbal, &quot;Fearless Girl,&quot; was installed facing &quot;Charging Bull.&quot; It was commissioned to advertise for an index fund that comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership and installed in anticipation of International Women&#x27;s Day the following day. It depicts a girl high, promoting female empowerment. After Di Modica filed complaints about &quot;Fearless Girl&quot;, it was removed in November 2018 and relocated to outside the New York Stock Exchange. A plaque with footprints was placed on the original site of &quot;Fearless Girl&quot;.

In November 2019, city officials announced that they wished to move &quot;Charging Bull&quot; to a plaza outside the New York Stock Exchange due to safety concerns at Bowling Green. Officials stated that because &quot;Charging Bull&quot; is located on a traffic median with large crowds, it was vulnerable to terrorist attacks, citing examples such as the 2017 truck attack on the nearby West Side Highway. Local community group Downtown Alliance supported the relocation, but Di Modica opposed it. The New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) had filed an application with the New York City Public Design Commission (PDC) to relocate &quot;Charging Bull&quot;, but subsequently withdrew the application, which a city spokesperson said was due to uncertainty over the new location. Residents of Manhattan Community District 1, which includes the Financial District, expressed opposition to the relocation in a meeting with city officials in May 2020. At the time, updated plans called for &quot;Charging Bull&quot; to be located at the corner of Broad Street and Wall Street, north of &quot;Fearless Girl&quot;. The PDC declined to endorse relocation in June 2020.

On October 18, 2021, a statue of Harambe, a gorilla, was placed facing the statue in a similar manner to &quot;Fearless Girl&quot; and thousands of bananas were placed under the bull&#x27;s feet. The act was carried out by organizers promoting Sapien.Network, an in-development social media network.

In fall 2021, artist Nelson Saiers placed a series of sculptures next to the &quot;Bull&quot; to comment on the Federal Reserve&#x27;s monetary policy and inflation. The first, &quot;Cheap Money is Out of Order,&quot; featured a gumball machine filled with $10 bills offered for 25 cents with an &quot;Out of Order!&quot; sign taped to its face.

==Replicas==
In 2010, a similar &quot;Charging Bull&quot; sculpture by Di Modica was installed in Shanghai on commission by the Shanghai city authority; it is informally called the &quot;Bund Bull&quot;. Two years later, Di Modica unofficially installed another &quot;Charging Bull&quot; sculpture outside the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on Beursplein, Amsterdam.

In 2019, Professional Bull Riders authorized Di Modica to craft a scaled replica of &quot;Charging Bull&quot; as the trophy for the champion of their annual Monster Energy PBR Unleash the Beast bull riding major event, the &quot;Monster Energy Buck Off at the Garden&quot; major. It was first presented during the 2020 event to João Ricardo Vieira.

===Art market===

Di Modica worked the majority of his career alone, from his SoHo studio without representation. By the 1990s, Di Modica&#x27;s artwork had achieved global icon status, but he continued to work outside of the formal art market. By 2000 he had built up a roster of wealthy private collectors. He ate in Cipriani Downtown most days whilst in New York where he met new clients and entertained his existing ones.

Di Modica put the original 16ft &quot;Charging Bull&quot; on the market in 2004 with an asking price of $5m. Joe Lewis, the British billionaire and ex-owner of Christies, later purchased the sculpture on the condition that he never move it from Bowling Green. Lewis also purchased the rest of the 16ft edition which he installed on his various golf courses. In 2012, Di Modica met the London-based art dealer, Jacob Harmer, and shortly afterwards entered into his first formal representation agreement with Harmer&#x27;s dealership, Geist, based on Mount Street, Mayfair. From 2013, Harmer began documenting the life of the artist, commissioning new sculptures, buying back historical works and building a global market.

In October 2018, the first major work by Modica came to auction, a 6ft polished bronze version of &quot;Charging Bull&quot; at Phillips London which was the first in an edition of eight and marked &quot;1987–89&quot;. The sculpture sold for £309,000 ($405,000). In March 2019, a stainless steel version of &quot;Charging Bull&quot; came to auction at Sotheby&#x27;s New York and despite being in poor condition, sold for $275,000. In &quot;Arturo Di Modica: The Last Modern Master&quot;, his representative confirms selling 4ft sculptures for up to $496,000.

==Criticism==

&quot;Charging Bull&quot; has often been a subject of criticism from an anti-capitalist perspective. The Occupy Wall Street protests used the bull as a symbolic figure around which to direct their critiques of corporate greed. A 2011 image from &quot;Adbusters&quot; portraying a dancer posed in an attitude position atop the sculpture was used to promote the forthcoming protests. The first gathering of Occupy took place around the sculpture on September 17, 2011, before moving to Zuccotti Park. Because of the protests, the bull was surrounded by barricades and guarded by police until 2014.

&quot;Charging Bull&quot; has been likened to the golden calf worshiped by the Israelites during their Exodus from Egypt. During Occupy Wall Street on multiple occasions an interfaith group of religious leaders led a procession of a golden calf figure that was modeled on the bull. A large papier-mâché piñata made by Sebastian Errazuriz for a 2014 New York design festival was intended to be reminiscent of both the golden calf and &quot;Charging Bull&quot;. Further comparisons to the golden calf have been made by Jewish and Christian religious commentators.

==Vandalism==
As a prominent symbol of Wall Street and capitalism generally, &quot;Charging Bull&quot; has been the frequent target of vandalism, particularly as an act of civil disobedience. Shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers during the 2008 financial crisis, the bull&#x27;s scrotum was painted blue. Leading up to a protest on May 12, 2011, the bull was tagged in at least two locations, once again including the scrotum, with the Anarchist &quot;circle-A&quot; iconography, prompting the New York City Police Department to temporarily install barricades around the sculpture. The barriers returned that fall during the Occupy Wall Street protests, and remained in place until March 25, 2014, despite a unanimous resolution from the local community board saying they constituted a hazard to pedestrians.

On September 14, 2017, three months after U.S. president Donald Trump formally announced the United States&#x27; withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change, an artist attempting to highlight U.S. popular support for the accord doused the head of the sculpture in a blue pigment.

In 2019, &quot;Charging Bull&quot; was vandalized twice. On September 7, a man from Dallas struck the sculpture with a banjo, leaving a sizable dent in the horn. Professional Bull Riders donated money from its ticket sales to pay for fixes to the horn, and Di Modica personally came to the site the following month to repair his creation. Then, on October 7, activists from Extinction Rebellion hurled fake blood over the sculpture and staged a die-in on the surrounding traffic plaza. In June 2020, &quot;Charging Bull&quot; was covered in a tarp and monitored by police to protect it from vandalism attempts during the George Floyd protests in New York City.

==In popular culture==
The history of the sculpture and its sculptor was presented in the 2014 Italian documentary film &quot;Il Toro di Wall Street&quot;, released internationally as &quot;The Charging Bull&quot;. In &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;, Darlene Alderson (Carly Chaikin) is shown castrating the statue.

Charging Bull has featured in several films set in Manhattan, including &quot;The Big Short&quot;, &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, and &quot;Hitch&quot;. The statue appears in the 2011 remake of &quot;Arthur&quot; in which Russell Brand and Luis Guzman respectively as Arthur and his butler crash into it with a Batmobile while dressed as Batman and Robin handing the bovine a giant severance package. In &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2010), the sculpture comes alive and chases Nicolas Cage&#x27;s character down Broadway. The sculpture can be seen floating through space at the end of &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; (2021) after presumably being blown into orbit by the comet&#x27;s impact.

<doc id="446402" wikidata="Q654024" url="?curid=446402" title="Bayon">
<text>The Bayon (, ) ( &quot;BAI-on&quot;) is a richly decorated Khmer temple related to Buddhism at Angkor in Cambodia. Built in the late 12th or early 13th century as the state temple of the King Jayavarman VII (), the Bayon stands at the centre of Jayavarman&#x27;s capital, Angkor Thom ().

The Bayon&#x27;s most distinctive feature is the multitude of serene and smiling stone faces of Brahma - probably modeled on the face of King Jayavarman VII - on every side the many towers that jut out from the upper terrace and cluster around its central peak. The main conservatory body, the Japanese Government Team for the Safeguarding of Angkor (the JSA) has described the temple as &quot;the most striking expression of the baroque style&quot; of Khmer architecture, as contrasted with the classical style of Angkor Wat ().

== Etymology ==

The original name for the Bayon is Jayagiri (, ) (or &quot;Victory Mountain&quot; or “Mountain of Brahma” ; “Jaya” - another name of Brahma and “giri” to mountain), with Sanskrit roots similar to Sīnhāgiri (&quot;Lion Rock&quot;). 

The name of Bayon was given by Etienne Aymonier in 1880. According to his report, Bayon was the Latin transliteration of what he had seen written in Khmer as &quot;Bayânt&quot; which he presumed must have been a corrupted form of the Pali &quot;Vejayant&quot; or Sanskrit &quot;Vaijayant&quot;, the name of the celestial palace of Indra of which the Bayon was presumed to be the earthly reflection. The first syllable &quot;Ba&quot; as a Sanskritic prefix was similar to that found in other places such as Ba Phnom and could signify the presence of a protector or defensor.

== History ==
===Buddhist symbolism in the foundation of the temple by King Jayavarman VII===
The Bayon was the last state temple to be built at Angkor, and the only Angkorian state temple to be built primarily to worship Buddhist deities, though a great number of minor and local deities were also encompassed as representatives of the various districts and cities of the realm. Originally a Hindu temple, the Bayon (&quot;Jayagiri&quot;) was the centrepiece of Jayavarman VII&#x27;s massive program of monumental construction and public works, which was also responsible for the walls and nāga-bridges of Angkor Thom and the temples of Vishnu, Ta Prohm and Banteay Kdei.

The similarity of the 216 gigantic faces on the temple&#x27;s towers to other statues of the has led many scholars to the conclusion that the faces are representations of Jayavarman VII, himself. Scholars have theorized that the faces belong to Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. But some locals believe the temple was built for Brahma, since the faces have four sides, representing Brahma&#x27;s four faces. Also, the faces have three eyes, which symbolizes Shiva in the Trimurti. Buddha&#x27;s images seldom wear jewelry like necklaces, large earrings and a crown. The two hypotheses need not be regarded as mutually exclusive. Angkor scholar George Coedès has theorized that Jayavarman VII stood squarely in the tradition of the Khmer monarchs in thinking of himself as a &quot;devaraja&quot; (god-king), the difference being that while his predecessors were Hindus and associated themselves with Brahma and his symbol the, &quot;chaturmukha&quot; (four faces), Jayavarman VII was a Buddhist.

===Alterations following the death of Jayavarman VII===

Since the time of Jayavarman VII, the Bayon has undergone numerous Buddhist additions and alterations at the hands of subsequent monarchs. During the reign of Jayavarman VIII in the mid-13th century, the Khmer empire reverted to Hinduism and its state temple was altered accordingly. In later centuries, Theravada Buddhism became the dominant religion, leading to still further changes, before the temple was eventually abandoned to the jungle. Current features which were not part of the original plan include the terrace to the east of the temple, the libraries, the square corners of the inner gallery, and parts of the upper terrace.

===Modern restoration===
In the first part of the 20th century, the École Française d&#x27;Extrême Orient took the lead in the conservation of the temple, restoring it in accordance with the technique of anastylosis. Since 1995 the Japanese Government team for the Safeguarding of Angkor (the JSA) has been the main conservation body, and has held annual symposia.

==The site==

The temple is oriented towards the east, and so its buildings are set back to the west inside enclosures elongated along the east-west axis. Because the temple sits at the exact centre of Angkor Thom, roads lead to it directly from the gates at each of the city&#x27;s cardinal points. The temple itself has no wall or moats, these being replaced by those of the city itself: the city-temple arrangement, with an area of 9 square kilometres, is much larger than that of Angkor Wat to the south (2 km²).
Within the temple itself, there are two galleried enclosures (the third and second enclosures) and an upper terrace (the first enclosure). All of these elements are crowded against each other with little space between. Unlike Angkor Wat, which impresses with the grand scale of its architecture and open spaces, the Bayon &quot;gives the impression of being compressed within a frame which is too tight for it.&quot;

===The outer gallery: historical events and everyday life===

The outer wall of the outer gallery features a series of bas-reliefs depicting historical events and scenes from the everyday life of the Angkorian Khmer. Though highly detailed and informative in themselves, the bas-reliefs are not accompanied by any sort of epigraphic text, and for that reason considerable uncertainty remains as to which historical events are portrayed and how, if at all, the different reliefs are related. From the east gopura clockwise, the subjects are:

* in the southern part of the eastern gallery a marching Khmer army (including some Chinese soldiers), with musicians, horsemen, and officers mounted on elephants, followed by wagons of provisions;
* still in the eastern gallery, on the other side of the doorway leading into the courtyard, another procession followed by domestic scenes depicting Angkorian houses, some of the occupants of which appear to be Chinese merchants;
* in the southeast corner pavilion, an unfinished temple scene with towers, apsaras (), and a lingam ();

* in the eastern part of the southern gallery, a naval battle on the Tonle Sap () between Khmer and Cham forces, underneath which are more scenes from civilian life depicting a market, open-air cooking, hunters, and women tending to children and an invalid;
* still in the southern gallery, past the doorway leading to the courtyard, a scene with boats and fisherman, including a Chinese junk, below which is a depiction of a cockfight; then some palace scenes with princesses, servants, people engaged in conversations and games, wrestlers, and a wild boar fight; then a battle scene with Cham warriors disembarking from boats and engaging Khmer warriors whose bodies are protected by coiled ropes, followed by a scene in which the Khmer dominate the combat, followed by a scene in which the Khmer king celebrates a victory feast with his subjects;
* in the western part of the southern gallery, a military procession including both Khmers and Chams, elephants, war machines such as a large crossbow and a catapult;
* in the southern part of the western gallery, unfinished reliefs show an army marching through the forest, then arguments and fighting between groups of Khmers;
* in the western gallery, past the doorway to the courtyard, a scene depicting a melee between Khmer warriors, then a scene in which warriors pursue others past a pool in which an enormous fish swallows a small deer; then a royal procession, with the king standing on an elephant, preceded by the ark of the sacred flame;
* in the western part of the northern gallery, again unfinished, a scene of royal entertainment including athletes, jugglers and acrobats, a procession of animals, ascetics sitting in a forest, and more battles between Khmer and Cham forces;
* in the northern gallery, past the doorway to the courtyard, a scene in which the Khmer flee from Cham soldiers advancing in tight ranks;
* in the northeast corner pavilion, another marching Khmer army;
* in the eastern gallery, a land battle between Khmer and Cham forces, both of which are supported by elephants: the Khmer appear to be winning.

The outer gallery encloses a courtyard in which there are two libraries (one on either side of the east entrance). Originally the courtyard contained 16 chapels, but these were subsequently demolished by the Hindu restorationist Jayavarman VIII.

===The inner gallery: depictions of mythological events===
The inner gallery is raised above ground level and has doubled corners, with the original redented cross-shape later filled out to a square. Its bas-reliefs, later additions of Jayavarman VIII, are in stark contrast to those of the outer: rather than set-piece battles and processions, the smaller canvases offered by the inner gallery are decorated for the most part with scenes from Hindu mythology. Some of the figures depicted are Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma, the members of the trimurti or threefold godhead of Hinduism, Apsaras or celestial dancers, Ravana and Garuda. There is however no certainty as to what some of the panels depict, or as to their relationship with one another. One gallery just north of the eastern gopura, for example, shows two linked scenes which have been explained as the freeing of a goddess from inside a mountain, or as an act of iconoclasm by Cham invaders. Another series of panels shows a king fighting a gigantic serpent with his bare hands, then having his hands examined by women, and finally lying ill in bed; these images have been connected with the legend of the Leper King, who contracted leprosy from the venom of a serpent with whom he had done battle. Less obscure are depictions of the construction of a Vishnuite temple (south of the western gopura) and the Churning of the Sea of Milk (north of the western gopura).
=== The upper terrace: 200 faces of Lokesvara===
The inner gallery is nearly filled by the upper terrace, raised one level higher again. The lack of space between the inner gallery and the upper terrace has led scholars to conclude that the upper terrace did not figure in the original plan for the temple, but that it was added shortly thereafter following a change in design. Originally, it is believed, the Bayon had been designed as a single-level structure, similar in that respect to the roughly contemporaneous foundations at Ta Prohm and Banteay Kdei.

The upper terrace is home to the famous &quot;face towers&quot; of the Bayon, each of which supports two, three or (most commonly) four gigantic smiling faces. In addition to the mass of the central tower, smaller towers are located along the inner gallery (at the corners and entrances), and on chapels on the upper terrace. &quot;Wherever one wanders,&quot; writes Maurice Glaize, &quot;the faces of Lokesvara follow and dominate with their multiple presence.&quot;

Efforts to read some significance into the numbers of towers and faces have run up against the circumstance that these numbers have not remained constant over time, as towers have been added through construction and lost to attrition. At one point, the temple was host to 49 such towers; now only 37 remain. The number of faces is approximately 200, but since some are only partially preserved there can be no definitive count.

===The central tower and sanctuary===
Like the inner gallery, the central tower was originally cruciform but was later filled out and made circular. It rises 43 metres above the ground. At the time of the temple&#x27;s foundation, the principal religious image was a statue of the Buddha, 3.6 m tall, located in the sanctuary at the heart of the central tower. The statue depicted the Buddha seated in meditation, shielded from the elements by the flared hood of the serpent king Mucalinda. During the reign of Hindu restorationist monarch Jayavarman VIII(), the figure was removed from the sanctuary and smashed to pieces. After being recovered in 1933 from the bottom of a well, it was pieced back together, and is now on display in a small pavilion at Angkor.

<doc id="446404" wikidata="Q2892284" url="?curid=446404" title="Baylor College of Medicine">
<text>The Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) is a private medical school in Houston, Texas, United States. Originally as the Baylor University College of Medicine from 1903 to 1969, the college became independent with the current name and has been separate from Baylor University since 1969. The college consists of four schools: the School of Medicine, the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the School of Health Professions, and the National School of Tropical Medicine.

The school is part owner, alongside Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI), of Baylor St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center, the flagship hospital of the CHI St. Luke&#x27;s Health system. Other affiliated teaching hospitals and research institutes include Harris Health System&#x27;s Ben Taub Hospital, Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TIRR Memorial Hermann, the Menninger Clinic, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, and the Children&#x27;s Hospital of San Antonio. On November 18, 2020, Baylor College of Medicine announced a new affiliation with Baylor Scott &amp; White Health. This will result in the development of a new regional medical school campus in Temple, Texas, which will enroll 40 students per year starting in fall 2023.

==History==
The Baylor College of Medicine was originally founded in 1900 in Dallas, Texas, by a group of Dallas physicians as the University of Dallas Medical Department, despite the absence of any institution under the University of Dallas name. This occurred following a meeting of Dallas area physicians on August 16, 1900, for the purpose taking the preliminary steps to establish a medical college. The majority of physicians in attendance opposed the creation of a medical college; however, the remaining physicians in favor set up a committee of medical professional and three laymen to secure a board of directors for the proposed college.

The school&#x27;s charter was filed with the Texas Secretary of State on September 15, 1900, with three physicians as the incorporators: Drs. Samuel E. Milliken, J. B. Titterington, and Lawrence Ashton. The school opened on November 19, 1900, with 81 students in a former synagogue, Temple Emanu-el, located at 292 Commerce Street (today 1306 Commerce Street).

In 1903, an alliance with Baylor University in Waco was formed and the name was changed to Baylor University College of Medicine.

By 1918, Baylor University College of Medicine was the only private medical school in Texas.

=== Relocation to Houston ===
The M.D. Anderson Foundation invited Baylor to join the newly formed Texas Medical Center in Houston in 1943. The school opened in the medical center July 12, 1943, in a converted Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. warehouse, with 131 students. Four years later, Baylor moved to its present site in the Roy and Lillie Cullen Building, the first building completed in the Texas Medical Center.

In 1948, Michael E. DeBakey joined the faculty as chair of the Department of Surgery, and the following year, the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences was established. Baylor&#x27;s rise in prominence began in the 1950s when DeBakey&#x27;s surgical techniques garnered international attention. In the 1960s, the college underwent its first major expansion.

=== Independence and expansion ===
In 1969, the college separated from Baylor University and became an independent institution, which allowed it access to federal research funding, changing its name to Baylor College of Medicine. Also in 1969, BCM negotiated with the Texas Legislature to double its class size in order to increase the number of physicians in Texas.

=== Disaffiliation from Houston Methodist Hospital ===
In 2004, Baylor did not renew its affiliation agreement with Houston Methodist Hospital, the school&#x27;s primary private adult teaching hospital, following contentious discussions between the two institutions. This split is notable as the only instance in American medical history of a medical school and one of its primary teaching hospitals parting ways.

=== Recent history ===
In 2005, Baylor College of Medicine began building a hospital and clinic, to be called the Baylor Clinic and Hospital, slated to open in 2011. In 2009, the college postponed construction for financial reasons, with the outer shell of the hospital completed but the interiors remaining unfinished. In March 2012, BCM decided to convert the building to an outpatient clinic center. In 2009, BCM entered into discussions with Rice University regarding a potential merger between the two Houston institutions. After extensive meetings, the boards at both institutions decided that each school would remain independent. In 2010, Baylor University entered into talks with BCM to strengthening ties to each other; however, the merger did not occur. Baylor University Board of Regents appoints 25% of the Baylor College of Medicine&#x27;s board of trustees.

On June 21, 2010, Dr. Paul Klotman was named as the President and CEO of the Baylor College of Medicine.

In January 2014, BCM and CHI St. Luke&#x27;s announced they would become joint owners of Baylor St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center, a hospital at the Texas Medical Center (formerly known as St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Hospital, then St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center after it was purchased by Catholic Health Initiatives in 2013). A partially completed hospital building on the BCM–McNair Campus is slated to open in 2015 and will become BCM&#x27;s acute-care hospital and main medical teaching facility.

On November 18, 2020, Baylor College of Medicine announced a new affiliation with Baylor Scott &amp; White Health that will result in the development of a new regional medical school campus in Temple, Texas which will enroll 40 students per year starting in fall 2023.

== Reputation ==
Baylor College of Medicine ranks among the top 25 graduate programs in Biological Sciences in the United States according to a 2022 survey. Within the School of Health Professions, the Nurse anesthetist program ranks 2nd and the physician assistant program ranks 3rd. A program in Orthotics and Prosthetics began in 2013, with 18 students in the first class. The National School of Tropical Medicine is the only school in the nation dedicated exclusively to patient care, research, education and policy related to neglected tropical diseases. A program in Genetic Counseling began in 2018, with 8 students in the first class.

==School of Medicine==
Each year the medical school matriculates around 185 students, around 75% of whom are Texas residents. As of April 2020, Baylor College of Medicine is the third least expensive private medical school in the country in terms of tuition.

=== Curriculum ===
The MD curriculum consists of 1.5 years of preclinical foundational sciences, followed by 2.5 years of clinical curriculum.

It is one of the few medical schools in the United States that is structured with an accelerated 1.5 year preclinical curriculum.

=== Dual degree programs ===
Baylor offers four programs that give medical students the opportunity to earn a second degree alongside the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree.

* MD/PhD with the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences
* MD/MPH with the UTHealth School of Public Health
* MD/MBA with the Rice University Jesse H. Jones School of Business
* MD/JD with the University of Houston Law Center

Baylor College of Medicine is one of only 51 medical institutions in the United States to offer a Medical Scientist Training Program. This federally sponsored and highly competitive program allows exceptionally well-qualified students to study for a combined MD and Ph.D. in a medical science to be earned in 7–9 total years. Typically, 8–12 students matriculate into this program per year and receive free tuition in addition to a stipend of $29,000 per academic year.

==Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences==
The GSBS ranks 25th for best Ph.D. program in the biological sciences.
Overall, in 2018 BCM ranked 20th in terms of research funding from the National Institutes of Health based on rankings done by the Blue Ridge Institute.

==School of Health Professions==
Physician Assistant

The School&#x27;s Physician Assistant Program which began in 1971 as a certificate program, was elevated to Bachelor of Science status in 1975, and on to a Master of Science program in 1989. Today, this program ranks 3rd among the nation&#x27;s physician assistant programs according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Nurse Anesthesia

The 2012 graduates of the Graduate Program in Nurse Anesthesia Program were the first to earn their doctorate of nursing practice from the Program. Developed from a 1968 a certificate program that was offered by the Harris County Hospital District, now the Harris Health System, in 1983, it became a Master of Science degree program under the auspices of Baylor. This program ranks 2nd in the nation among training programs in nurse anesthesia according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Orthotics and Prosethetics

The Orthotics and Prosthetics Program welcomed its first students in June 2013. It is a 30-month program, where the first 12 months are dedicated to the didactic curriculum, and the following 18 months are spent on clinical rotations and research. It Is the only program in the country to integrate a series of full-time clinical rotations exposing students to six core areas of expertise designed to meet the requirements of the NCOPE-approved residency.

Genetic Counseling

In 2018, the Genetic Counseling Program welcomed its first students. It is a 21-month program consisting of didactic coursework, clinical rotations, and a student thesis. Genetic counseling students rotate through prenatal, pediatric, adult, cancer, and specialty clinics at Baylor College of Medicine and its affiliated hospitals in and around the Texas Medical Center.

==Residency training==
Baylor College of Medicine sponsors Graduate Medical Education in more than 80 ACGME-accredited, and 40 Texas Medical Board (TMB)-approved training programs.

At Baylor College of Medicine residents and fellows learn from one of the most diverse patient populations anywhere in the country. This is partially due to the diversity found within the city of Houston, which has no single majority ethnic group. The hospitals of the Texas Medical Center and Houston&#x27;s status as a hub for international industry also draw patients from every corner of the globe. Adding to this diversity are the many and varied settings in which residents and fellows have the opportunity to train, including Baylor St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center and Baylor&#x27;s many affiliated hospitals.

==Research==

=== Biomedical research ===
In 2013, Baylor College of Medicine ranked 19th in terms of research funding from the National Institutes of Health based on rankings done by the Blue Ridge Institute.

=== Conservation research ===
In July 2024, the first-ever mRNA vaccine for elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV), developed by Baylor College of Medicine, the Houston Zoo, and Colossal Biosciences, was successfully administered to an asian elephant.

<doc id="446411" wikidata="Q1050048" url="?curid=446411" title="Financial District, Manhattan">
<text>The Financial District of Lower Manhattan, also known as FiDi, is a neighborhood located on the southern tip of Manhattan in New York City. It is bounded by the West Side Highway on the west, Chambers Street and City Hall Park on the north, Brooklyn Bridge on the northeast, the East River to the southeast, and South Ferry and the Battery on the south.

The City of New York was created in the modern-day Financial District in 1624, and the neighborhood roughly overlaps with the boundaries of the New Amsterdam settlement in the late 17th century. The district comprises the offices and headquarters of many of the city&#x27;s major financial institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Anchored on Wall Street in the Financial District, New York City has been called both the leading financial center and the most economically powerful city of the world, and the New York Stock Exchange is the world&#x27;s largest stock exchange by total market capitalization. Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Financial District, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, NASDAQ, the New York Board of Trade, and the former American Stock Exchange.

The Financial District is part of Manhattan Community District 1, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10004, 10005, 10006, 10007, and 10038. It is patrolled by the 1st Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==Description==
The Financial District encompasses roughly the area south of City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan but excludes Battery Park and Battery Park City. The former World Trade Center complex was located in the neighborhood until the September 11, 2001, attacks; the neighborhood includes the successor One World Trade Center. The heart of the Financial District is often considered to be the corner of Wall Street and Broad Street, both of which are contained entirely within the district. The northeastern part of the Financial District (along Fulton Street and John Street) was known in the early 20th century as the Insurance District, due to the large number of insurance companies that were either headquartered there, or maintained their New York offices there.

Although the term is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;Wall Street&quot;, the latter term is often applied metonymously to the financial markets as a whole (and is also a street in the district), whereas &quot;the Financial District&quot; implies an actual geographical location. The Financial District is part of Manhattan Community Board 1, which also includes five other neighborhoods (Battery Park City, Civic Center, Greenwich South, Seaport, and Tribeca).

===Street grid===
The streets in the area were laid out as part of the Castello Plan prior to the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, a grid plan that dictates the placement of most of Manhattan&#x27;s streets north of Houston Street. Thus, it has small streets &quot;barely wide enough for a single lane of traffic are bordered on both sides by some of the tallest buildings in the city&quot;, according to one description, which creates &quot;breathtaking artificial canyons&quot;. Some streets have been designated as pedestrian-only with vehicular traffic prohibited.

===Tourism===
The Financial District is a major location of tourism in New York City. One report described Lower Manhattan as &quot;swarming with camera-carrying tourists&quot;. Tour guides highlight places such as Trinity Church, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building gold vaults 80 feet below street level (worth $100 billion), and the New York Stock Exchange Building. A &quot;Scoundrels of Wall Street Tour&quot; is a walking historical tour which includes a museum visit and discussion of various financiers &quot;who were adept at finding ways around finance laws or loopholes through them&quot;. Occasionally artists make impromptu performances; for example, in 2010, a troupe of 22 dancers &quot;contort their bodies and cram themselves into the nooks and crannies of the Financial District in &quot;Bodies in Urban Spaces&quot;&quot; choreographed by Willi Donner. One chief attraction, the Federal Reserve, paid $750,000 to open a visitors&#x27; gallery in 1997. The New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange also spent money in the late 1990s to upgrade facilities for visitors. Attractions include the gold vault beneath the Federal Reserve and that &quot;staring down at the trading floor was as exciting as going to the Statue of Liberty&quot;.

==Architecture==
The Financial District&#x27;s architecture is generally rooted in the Gilded Age, though there are also some art deco influences in the neighborhood. The area is distinguished by narrow streets, a steep topography, and high-rises Construction in such narrow steep areas has resulted in occasional accidents such as a crane collapse. One report divided lower Manhattan into three basic districts:

# The Financial District proper—particularly along John Street
# South of the World Trade Center area—the handful of blocks located south of the World Trade Center along Greenwich, Washington and West Streets
# Seaport district—characterized by century-old low-rise buildings and South Street Seaport; the seaport is &quot;quiet, residential, and has an old world charm&quot; according to one description.
Federal Hall National Memorial, on the site of the first U.S. capitol and the first inauguration of George Washington as the first President of the United States, is located at the corner of Wall Street and Nassau Street.

The Financial District has a number of tourist attractions such as the South Street Seaport Historic District, newly renovated Pier 17, the New York City Police Museum, the Museum of American Finance, the National Museum of the American Indian, Trinity Church, St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel, and the famous bull. Bowling Green is the starting point of traditional ticker-tape parades on Broadway, where here it is also known as the Canyon of Heroes. The Museum of Jewish Heritage and the Skyscraper Museum are both in adjacent Battery Park City which is also home to the Brookfield Place (formerly World Financial Center).

Another key anchor for the area is the New York Stock Exchange. City authorities realize its importance, and believed that it has &quot;outgrown its neoclassical temple at the corner of Wall and Broad streets&quot;, and in 1998 offered substantial tax incentives to try to keep it in the Financial District. Plans to rebuild it were delayed by the September 11, 2001, attacks. The Exchange still occupies the same site. The Exchange is the locus for a large amount of technology and data. For example, to accommodate the three thousand persons who work directly on the Exchange floor requires 3,500 kilowatts of electricity, along with 8,000 phone circuits on the trading floor alone, and 200 miles of fiber-optic cable below ground.

===Official landmarks===

Buildings in the Financial District can have one of several types of official landmark designations:
*The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is the New York City agency that is responsible for identifying and designating the city&#x27;s landmarks and the buildings in the city&#x27;s historic districts. New York City landmarks (NYCL) can be categorized into one of several groups: individual (exterior), interior, and scenic landmarks.
*The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government&#x27;s official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance.
*The National Historic Landmark (NHL) focuses on places of significance in American history, architecture, engineering, or culture; all NHL sites are also on the NRHP.

The following landmarks are situated south of Morris Street and west of Whitehall Street/Broadway:

*21 West Street (NRHP, NYCL)
*Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, Bowling Green (NHL, NRHP, NYCL, NYCL interior)
*Bowling Green fence (NYCL)
*Bowling Green (NRHP)

==History==

===New Amsterdam===

What is now the Financial District was once part of New Amsterdam, situated on the strategic southern tip of the island of Manhattan. New Amsterdam was derived from Fort Amsterdam, meant to defend the fur trade operations of the Dutch West India Company in the North River (Hudson River). In 1624, it became a provincial extension of the Dutch Republic and was designated as the capital of the province of New Netherland in 1625. By 1655, the population of New Netherland had grown to 2,000 people, with 1,500 living in New Amsterdam. By 1664, the population of New Netherland had skyrocketed to almost 9,000 people, 2,500 of whom lived in New Amsterdam, 1,000 lived near Fort Orange, and the remainder in other towns and villages. In 1664 the English took over New Amsterdam and renamed it New York City.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the corporate culture of New York was a primary center for the construction of early skyscrapers, and was rivaled only by Chicago on the American continent. There were also residential sections, such as the Bowling Green section between Broadway and the Hudson River, and between Vesey Street and the Battery. The Bowling Green area was described as &quot;Wall Street&#x27;s back yard&quot; with poor people, high infant mortality rates, and the &quot;worst housing conditions in the city&quot;. As a result of the construction, looking at New York City from the east, one can see two distinct clumps of tall buildings—the Financial District on the left, and the taller Midtown neighborhood on the right. The geology of Manhattan is well-suited for tall buildings, with a solid mass of bedrock underneath Manhattan providing a firm foundation for tall buildings. Skyscrapers are expensive to build, but the scarcity of land in the Financial District made it suitable for the construction of skyscrapers.

Business writer John Brooks in his book &quot;Once in Golconda&quot; considered the start of the 20th century period to have been the area&#x27;s heyday. The address of 23 Wall Street, the headquarters of J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, known as &quot;The Corner&quot;, was &quot;the precise center, geographical as well as metaphorical, of financial America and even of the financial world&quot;.

On September 16, 1920, close to the corner of Wall and Broad Street, the busiest corner of the Financial District and across the offices of the Morgan Bank, a powerful bomb exploded. It killed 38 and seriously injured 143 people. The area was subjected to numerous threats; one bomb threat in 1921 led to detectives sealing off the area to &quot;prevent a repetition of the Wall Street bomb explosion&quot;.

====Late-20th century growth====

During most of the 20th century, the Financial District was a business community with practically only offices which emptied out at night. Writing in &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot; in 1961, urbanist Jane Jacobs described a &quot;deathlike stillness that settles on the district after 5:30 and all day Saturday and Sunday&quot;. But there has been a change towards greater residential use of the area, pushed forwards by technological changes and shifting market conditions. The general pattern is for several hundred thousand workers to commute into the area during the day, sometimes by sharing a taxicab from other parts of the city as well as from New Jersey and Long Island, and then leave at night. In 1970 only 833 people lived &quot;south of Chambers Street&quot;; by 1990, 13,782 people were residents with the addition of areas such as Battery Park City and Southbridge Towers. Battery Park City was built on 92 acres of landfill, and 3,000 people moved there beginning about 1982, but by 1986 there was evidence of more shops and stores and a park, along with plans for more residential development.

Construction of the World Trade Center began in 1966, but the World Trade Center had trouble attracting tenants when completed. Nonetheless, some substantial firms purchased space there. Its impressive height helped make it a visual landmark for drivers and pedestrians. In some respects, the nexus of the Financial District moved physically from Wall Street to the World Trade Center complex and surrounding buildings such as the Deutsche Bank Building, 90 West Street, and One Liberty Plaza. Real estate growth during the latter part of the 1990s was significant, with deals and new projects happening in the Financial District and elsewhere in Manhattan; one firm invested more than $24 billion in various projects, many in the Wall Street area. In 1998, the NYSE and the city struck a $900 million deal which kept the NYSE from moving across the river to Jersey City; the deal was described as the &quot;largest in city history to prevent a corporation from leaving town&quot;. A competitor to the NYSE, NASDAQ, moved its headquarters from Washington to New York.
In 1987, the stock market plunged and, in the relatively brief recession following, lower Manhattan lost 100,000 jobs according to one estimate. Since telecommunications costs were coming down, banks and brokerage firms could move away from the Financial District to more affordable locations. The recession of 1990–91 was marked by office vacancy rates downtown which were &quot;persistently high&quot; and with some buildings &quot;standing empty&quot;.

====Residential neighborhood====
In 1995, city authorities offered the &quot;Lower Manhattan Revitalization Plan&quot; which offered incentives to convert commercial properties to residential use. According to one description in 1996, &quot;The area dies at night ... It needs a neighborhood, a community.&quot; During the past two decades there has been a shift towards greater residential living areas in the Financial District, with incentives from city authorities in some instances. Many empty office buildings have been converted to lofts and apartments; for example, the Liberty Tower, the office building of oil magnate Harry Sinclair, was converted to a co-op in 1979. In 1996, a fifth of buildings and warehouses were empty, and many were converted to living areas. Some conversions met with problems, such as aging gargoyles on building exteriors having to be expensively restored to meet with current building codes. Residents in the area have sought to have a supermarket, a movie theater, a pharmacy, more schools, and a &quot;good diner&quot;. The discount retailer named &quot;Job Lot&quot; used to be located at the World Trade Center but moved to Church Street; merchants bought extra unsold items at steep prices and sold them as a discount to consumers, and shoppers included &quot;thrifty homemakers and browsing retirees&quot; who &quot;rubbed elbows with City Hall workers and Wall Street executives&quot;; but the firm went bust in 1993.
There were reports that the number of residents increased by 60% during the 1990s to about 25,000 although a second estimate (based on the 2000 census based on a different map) places the residential population in 2000 at 12,042. By 2001 there were several grocery stores, dry cleaners, and two grade schools and a top high school.

===21st century===

====September 11 attacks====
In 2001, the &quot;Big Board&quot;, as some termed the NYSE, was described as the world&#x27;s &quot;largest and most prestigious stock market&quot;. When the World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11, 2001, it left an architectural void as new developments since the 1970s had played off the complex aesthetically. The attacks &quot;crippled&quot; the communications network. One estimate was that 45% of the neighborhood&#x27;s &quot;best office space&quot; had been lost. The physical destruction was immense:
Still, the NYSE was determined to re-open on September 17, almost a week after the attack. After September 11, the financial services industry went through a downturn with a sizable drop in year-end bonuses of $6.5 billion, according to one estimate from a state comptroller&#x27;s office.

To guard against a vehicular bombing in the area, authorities built concrete barriers, and found ways over time to make them more aesthetically appealing by spending $5000 to $8000 apiece on bollards. Several streets in the neighborhood, including Wall and Broad Streets, were blocked off by specially designed bollards:
====Redevelopment====
The destruction of the World Trade Center spurred development on a scale that had not been seen in decades. Tax incentives provided by federal, state and local governments encouraged development. A new World Trade Center complex centered on Daniel Libeskind&#x27;s Memory Foundations was built after the 9/11 attacks. The centerpiece, which is now a tall structure, opened in 2014 as the One World Trade Center. Fulton Center, a new transit complex intended to improve access to the area, opened in 2014, followed by the World Trade Center Transportation Hub in 2016. Additionally, in 2007, the Maharishi Global Financial Capital of New York opened headquarters at 70 Broad Street near the NYSE, in an effort to seek investors.

By the 2010s, the Financial District had become established as a residential and commercial neighborhood. Several new skyscrapers such as 125 Greenwich Street and 130 William were being developed, while other structures such as 1 Wall Street, the Equitable Building, and the Woolworth Building were extensively renovated. Additionally, there were more signs of dogwalkers at night and a 24-hour neighborhood, although the general pattern of crowds during the working hours and emptiness at night was still apparent. There were also ten hotels and thirteen museums in 2010. In 2007 the French fashion retailer Hermès opened a store in the Financial District to sell items such as a &quot;$4,700 custom-made leather dressage saddle or a $47,000 limited edition alligator briefcase&quot;. However, there are reports of panhandlers like elsewhere in the city. By 2010 the residential population had increased to 24,400 residents. and the area was growing with luxury high-end apartments and upscale retailers.

On October 29, 2012, New York and New Jersey were inundated by Hurricane Sandy. Its 14-foot-high storm surge, a local record, caused massive street flooding in many parts of Lower Manhattan. Power to the area was knocked out by a transformer explosion at a Con Edison plant. With mass transit in New York City already suspended as a precaution even before the storm hit, the New York Stock Exchange and other financial exchanges were closed for two days, re-opening on October 31. From 2013 to 2021, nearly two hundred buildings in the Financial District were converted to residential use. Furthermore, between 2001 and 2021, the proportion of companies in the area that were in the finance and insurance industries declined from 55 to 30 percent.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies the Financial District as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan was 39,699, an increase of 19,611 (97.6%) from the 20,088 counted in 2000.

Most inhabitants are young to middle-aged adults: half (50%) are between the ages of 25–44, while 14% are between 0–17, and 18% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 11% and 7% respectively.

<doc id="446413" wikidata="Q3018182" url="?curid=446413" title="David Justice">
<text>David Christopher Justice (born April 14, 1966) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and designated hitter who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He won the World Series with the Atlanta Braves and the New York Yankees, won the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 1990, and was a three-time MLB All-Star. He also played for the Cleveland Indians and the Oakland Athletics.

== Early life ==
Justice was raised Catholic, and attended high school at Covington Latin School, a Catholic school across the river from his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. He later attended Thomas More College in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, on a basketball scholarship.

==Professional career==

===Atlanta Braves===
Justice made his major league debut in May 1989, playing for the Atlanta Braves. The then 23-year-old right fielder earned the starting job after Braves fan favorite Dale Murphy was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in August 1990. Justice promptly went on an offensive tear during the second half of the season, finishing with 28 home runs, which helped him claim the National League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year Award. In 1991, the upstart Braves surged to the top of their division and Justice was leading the National League in runs batted in when he was sidelined by a nagging back injury in June. He finished with 87 runs batted in despite the injury and played in his first World Series.

After seeing his production slide slightly in 1992, Justice enjoyed a solid 1993 season. He clubbed 40 home runs and 120 runs batted in (RBIs) with 78 walks, finishing third in MVP voting behind Barry Bonds and Lenny Dykstra. Justice was batting .313 with a .427 on-base percentage and .531 slugging average when the strike ended play in 1994. When baseball returned in 1995, Justice helped his Braves to the World Series against the Cleveland Indians. He drew attention (and boos) when he criticized Atlanta fans for the level of support they were providing the team. However, Justice ended up a hero when his crucial home run in Game 6 provided the only run in a 1–0 game that clinched the championship.

In May 1996, a swing and miss in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates caused a season-ending shoulder separation.

===Cleveland Indians===
Just before the start of the 1997 season, the Braves traded Justice along with outfielder Marquis Grissom to the Cleveland Indians for outfielder Kenny Lofton and relief pitcher Alan Embree. He hit .329 with a .418 OBP and .596 slugging percentage in 1997, with 33 home runs, while making another World Series appearance. In 1998, he had 21 home runs, 88 RBIs, and a .476 slugging percentage, numbers he repeated exactly in 1999, though in 13 fewer games played. In 2000, he already had 21 home runs by June 29.

===New York Yankees===
On June 29, 2000, the Indians traded Justice to the New York Yankees for outfielder Ricky Ledée and two players to be named, who turned out to be pitchers Jake Westbrook and Zach Day. Justice won the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award for the 2000 American League Championship Series en route to his second World Series championship. Between the Indians and Yankees, Justice hit a career-high 41 home runs in 2000. His production slid considerably in 2001, when a groin injury put him on the disabled list twice.

===Oakland Athletics===
The Yankees traded Justice to the New York Mets on December 7, 2001, for third baseman Robin Ventura. A week later, the Mets dealt him to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for pitchers Mark Guthrie and Tyler Yates. Justice was named the American League Player of the Week for the first week of the 2002 season, and was part of the Athletics&#x27; 20-game winning streak that year.

===Career totals===
Justice finished his career with a .279 batting average, with a .378 OBP and .500 slugging percentage, 929 runs, 1,571 hits, 280 doubles, 24 triples, 305 home runs, 903 walks and 1,017 RBIs in 1,610 games. From 1991 to his last season in 2002, Justice&#x27;s teams made the postseason every year (with the exception of the strike-shortened 1994 season), and reached the World Series seven times, winning twice. He is in the top ten in a number of career postseason categories, such as at-bats, games played, hits, doubles and runs scored.

===Honors===
On May 9, 1994, Justice was listed in &quot;People&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; issue (Vol. 41 No. 17). The article goes on to state: &quot;&#x27;I check my face to make sure there&#x27;s nothing sticking on it,&#x27; he says. &#x27;But I don&#x27;t make sure every hair&#x27;s in place.&#x27; He needn&#x27;t worry. He gets the most fan mail on the team and is mobbed when he makes personal appearances on behalf of charities.&quot;

In March 2007, it was announced that Justice would be inducted into the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame. He was the first member of any of the Braves&#x27; 14 consecutive division title teams (1991–2005, excluding the strike-shortened season in 1994) to be inducted in the Braves Hall of Fame. The induction took place on August 17, 2007. Numerous ex-Braves players and coaches were in attendance and tribute videos from Braves legend Hank Aaron and former owner Ted Turner were shown. Prior to that evening&#x27;s game Justice was presented with a portrait by sports artist Bart Forbes during an on-field ceremony. 

Justice was eligible for the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008, but he received only one vote, preventing him from being named on future ballots. The timing of the vote may have adversely affected his candidacy, as it was held shortly after the release of the Mitchell Report. Justice was one of 86 players named in the report.

===Mitchell Report===
In an interview for the Mitchell Report, released December 13, 2007, Justice denied using performance-enhancing substances, but was willing to report the names of individuals he suspected, though he claimed to have no direct knowledge of any other player&#x27;s steroid use. He also claims to have never been warned of the side effects of steroids or explicitly told steroids were a banned substance. The Mitchell Report states that in a later interview, former New York Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski claimed to have sold Justice human growth hormone when Justice was with the Yankees after the 2000 World Series. Justice has called the allegation &quot;a bald-faced lie&quot; and says that he has never met Radomski.

Justice has claimed that his only involvement with performance-enhancing drugs was a discussion about HGH in 2000 with Brian McNamee, then the New York Yankees&#x27; strength coach. Justice, who had shoulder problems, thought that HGH might aid in his recovery. Justice stated that after the discussion, he went to his locker and found a bag containing HGH and several injection needles; Justice claimed that he was unwilling to inject himself and never used any of it. Justice further stated in the interviews that all claims in the Mitchell Report concerning his alleged purchase and use of any performance-enhancing drugs were false and encouraged all players whose names appear in the report, especially Roger Clemens, to publicly deny any claims made by the Mitchell Report if they are untrue.

==Broadcasting career==
After his playing career, Justice served as a commentator for ESPN baseball telecasts for two years. He later joined the YES Network of the New York Yankees as a game and studio analyst, and also hosted the network&#x27;s youth-oriented program Yankees on Deck. Prior to the 2008 season, the YES Network announced that Justice would not appear on air during that season, but would contribute articles to the network&#x27;s website. Justice stated that this change was not in response to his inclusion in the Mitchell report, but was due to the destruction of his San Diego County home in the 2007 California wildfires and the recent passing of his mother. Justice never returned to the network.

Justice has also appeared on a 1992 episode of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and a 1997 episode of Arli$$. He was played by Stephen Bishop in &quot;Moneyball&quot;, the film adaptation of the best-selling Michael Lewis book &quot;&quot; about the Oakland Athletics baseball team and its general manager, Billy Beane.

==Personal life==

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1993, Justice married film actress Halle Berry. The couple resided in Sandy Springs, Georgia. They separated on February 22, 1996, and divorced on June 20, 1997. The marriage ended acrimoniously, with Berry seeking a restraining order against Justice. 

He married Rebecca Villalobos on February 8, 2001. Villalobos is CEO of Exotic Spices Calendars. They have three children: David Jr., Dionisio, and Raquel. In 2014, the family was on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, inspiring Raquel to pursue acting.

<doc id="446421" wikidata="Q8244123" url="?curid=446421" title="Battle of Celaya">
<text>The Battle of Celaya, 6–15 April 1915, was part of a series of military engagements in the Bajío during the Mexican Revolution between the winners, who had allied against the regime of Gen. Victoriano Huerta (February 1913-July 1914) and then fought each other for control of Mexico. The Constitutionalists under Gen. Venustiano Carranza faced off against the Army of the División del Norte of Pancho Villa. The first battle of Celaya was fought April 6–7, 1915, near Celaya in present-day Guanajuato, Mexico. The second battle of Celaya was fought April 15–16. These encounters between the Constitutionalist Army led by Gen. Álvaro Obregón, Venustiano Carranza&#x27;s best general, and the army under the command of Pancho Villa were crucial in determining the outcome of the Mexican Revolution.

Obregón chose the site of battle, arrived in advance to prepare it and kept to his defensive strategy, knowing Villa&#x27;s propensity for blind cavalry charges over an open field. Villa&#x27;s defeat was the result of his multiple tactical miscalculations and overconfidence in his much larger, undefeated army&#x27;s ability to best Obregón&#x27;s army under any circumstances. Villa&#x27;s División del Norte outnumbered Obregón&#x27;s Constitutionalists 2:1, but Obregón had lured Villa far from his communication and supply lines to a field with existing canals and trenches. Obregón was able to utilize many tactical innovations from the Western Front in the First World War—namely trenches, barbed wire and machine guns—in the defense. Villa continued his use of massed cavalry charges. New logistical and troop movement techniques such as the use of trains were seen.

Obregón and Villa met twice more in the Bajío at León (also called the battle of Trinidad), in a protracted battle lasting 38 days, and at Aguascalientes in July, sealing the Constitutionalists&#x27; victory over Villa. Taken together these battles in the Bajío are considered a watershed event in the Mexican Revolution and helped determine the military course of it. &quot;The two battles of Celaya did not bring the warring to an end, but they foretold Villa&#x27;s ultimate defeat.&quot; Villa lost as many as 50,000 men in these Bajío battles, and he ceased to be a force to contend with on a national scale.

==Commanders and armies==

The commander of the Constitutionalist forces was Álvaro Obregón. He, like Villa, had no formal military education but had served in a professional army. His military career began when he belatedly joined pro-Madero forces in 1912 to put down the anti-Madero rebellion of Pascual Orozco, but to his regret he had not joined Madero&#x27;s original call for revolution in 1910.

His military service was quite distinguished and he initially left the army as a colonel. He deftly navigated the shifting political alliances that marked the early days of the Mexican Revolution. Eventually he was appointed to be the senior general in the Carranza administration. Obregón often enlisted the help of military advisers and was an avid student of the latest military technological and tactical advancements. One of his most respected advisers was Col. Maximilian Kloss, a German immigrant turned army officer. Kloss’ military advice and remarkable insight into the nature of Villa&#x27;s style of war would prove decisive at Celaya. Obregón himself was known to be an urbane, intellectual person.

Villa, by contrast, was nearly illiterate and had never served in a professional army. However, he complemented his staff with Gen. Felipe Angeles, a capable career officer. After defecting to Villa&#x27;s División del Norte from Venustiano Carranza&#x27;s Constitutionalist Army in March 1914, Angeles became one of Villa&#x27;s most trusted military advisers. Unlike Villa, Angeles was more careful and calculating. Privately, he thought that Villa was often too rash in his decision-making. Angeles&#x27; initial absence due to an injury while riding his horse would prove critical at the beginning of the Battle of Celaya.

The army of Pancho Villa, the División del Norte, which had fought alongside the Constitutionalist Army (1913–14) to oust Victoriano Huerta, was not an army in the modern, industrialized sense. In addition to their military component, Villa&#x27;s army also included a large component of camp followers or soldaderas, who followed behind the main military force. These camp followers were often refugees, soldiers’ wives and family, and support personnel. This often slowed down Villa&#x27;s military forces and he eventually banned them. Villa himself was an excellent horseman from his early days as a bandit and tended to favor his cavalry and rely upon its speed to quickly maneuver around an enemy force. Before the Battle of Celaya, Villa&#x27;s forces had never been defeated in a major battle against its opponents.

Obregón was a skilled military commander and understood that if Villa could be lured into a decisive battle, his forces could be completely destroyed. Villa had consulted with his chief military adviser, Felipe Angeles, who attempted to convince him to avoid a major set-piece battle. History would vindicate Angeles’ military expertise, as Villa&#x27;s forces and tactics were no match for Obregón&#x27;s use of modern weaponry and tactics. Reportedly, Villa&#x27;s rationale for insisting on engaging Obregón&#x27;s forces was that he did not want to appear weak or inhibit the fighting spirit of his men. However, his actual words to Gen. Angeles cannot be completely verified, as no actual record of their conversation exists. Obregón&#x27;s men made excellent use of barbed wire and field-expedient obstacles to slow, disrupt and maneuver Villa&#x27;s forces into the fields of fire prepared for them. As a fighting force, the cavalry and infantry elements of the Villistas were highly mobile in early 20th-century terms. Villa used the rail system to maneuver his troops quickly, just as the Rurales, the crack rural police force of Porfirio Díaz, were deployed before the Revolution.

==Prelude==

Villa was known to be a rash and sometimes overconfident commander who would not refuse a battle with Obregón&#x27;s forces. This weakness would prove to be his undoing at Celaya. Also, Villa and Obregón intensely disliked each other, which led to a war of words before the battle. Publicly, Villa referred to Obregón as “El Perfumado” or “the one who wears perfume”, referring to Obregón&#x27;s perceived more refined qualities. While Villa was often impulsive and inflammatory, he was sometimes shrewd and cunning. Obregón understood Villa&#x27;s character and often tried to infuriate and provoke him. Immediately before the Battle of Celaya, Obregón boasted of his eventual defeat of Villa and even offered to dedicate his inevitable victory to his friends. As the war of words between the two commanders became more heated, Villa gave the following statement to the newspaper &quot;Vida Nueva&quot; on the night before the battle began: “This time Obregón will not escape me. I know that he will attempt to withdraw as he always does, but I shall force him to fight in order to destroy the forces that constitute an obstacle to military operations without being of any great use to the enemy.” As both sides sought a decisive battle, the stage was set for a huge military engagement. Obregón lured Villa to the field of battle that Obregón had chosen in the Bajio. Villa&#x27;s fighting style was traditional warfare relying on frontal attacks and cavalry charges. Obregón, however, adopted advanced tactics in the form of trenches and barbed wire, which were being used in the First World War.

==First battle==

===Strategic preparation===
Obregón&#x27;s strategy was to draw Villa&#x27;s army away from its lines of communication and supply and choose the place for a major encounter. Obregón&#x27;s lines of communication and supply were much shorter than Villa&#x27;s, but they were stretched nonetheless, as Obregón moved north, closer to Villa&#x27;s territory. Emiliano Zapata&#x27;s followers might have cut Obregón&#x27;s supply lines near Veracruz, but did not, &quot;to Villa&#x27;s disgust.&quot; Before the Battle of Celaya began, Obregón&#x27;s forces occupied the field first, a strategic advantage. This was critical to the primarily defensive strategy of Obregón. In a broad stroke he planned to goad Villa into an all-out frontal assault on his well-prepared defensive positions. As students of modern warfare, Obregón and his military advisers were acutely aware that machine guns, barbed wired and dug-in artillery gave a marked advantage to a defender. The terrain at Celaya was excellent for a defending force with modern armaments.

Obregón&#x27;s advance forces arrived at Celaya in early March, nearly a month before the battle itself. By early April he had increased the size of his forces, with &quot;6,000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry, 86 machine guns and 13 field pieces.&quot; It is unclear how many Villa commanded at Celaya.

While Villa planned to use his artillery assets to weaken Obregón&#x27;s defensive position, his overall plan was simply a full frontal assault by his cavalry and infantry at dawn on April 6, 1915. Prior to the battle, Villa had not personally surveyed the battlefield and was confident that his forces would punch through any defenses or his cavalry could outmaneuver them. The Constitutionalists had prepared cleared, overlapping fields of fire for their machine guns. Additionally, there were many ditches and small irrigation canals that, when improved, would serve as trenches to provide excellent cover and concealment to Obregón&#x27;s forces.

Critically, both Villa&#x27;s División del Norte and Obregón&#x27;s forces suffered chronic shortages of munitions. This was due in large part to the demand for ammunition created by the First World War and also to the increasing cost of the ammunition that remained for sale. This lack of ammunition resupply would prove to be a pivotal issue in the Battle of Celaya. Allegedly, some of the ammunition that Villa had purchased before the battle from private vendors from the US was faulty and failed to perform under the conditions of the battle. Whether or not this was deceit on the part of the suppliers is difficult if not impossible to discern. Furthermore, Villa&#x27;s forces were at a marked disadvantage regarding their artillery. Not only did Obregon&#x27;s forces possess 15 more artillery pieces than Villa, their scarce European-sourced ammunition was vastly more lethal, reliable and had a further effective range. Before the battle began, Villa was well aware of his force&#x27;s shortage of ammunition and communicated this in a message to Emiliano Zapata. Additionally, Villa&#x27;s forces did not attempt to disrupt the resupply of Obregón&#x27;s forces from the port city of Veracruz.

===Battle===

After the Constitutionalists occupied the battlefield on April 4, 1915, their commanders knew that the Villistas were close. As Obregón&#x27;s troops fortified their defensive positions and waited for the Villista main attack, Villa&#x27;s forces began to move towards Celaya on April 5. In order to disrupt the movement of Villa&#x27;s forces, Obregón ordered a 1,500-man element to occupy a hacienda called “El Guaje” near Celaya, to serve as a base to attack the railways that Villa relied upon for movement of his troops. This was a tactical miscalculation, as the majority of the Villista forces were already nearby and immediately attacked the comparatively small Constitutionalist force. As soon as Obregón heard of the engagement, he quickly boarded a troop train to personally reinforce his men at the hacienda. A competent military mind, Obregón immediately realized that this initial tactical error could be the perfect ruse to lure the bulk of Villa&#x27;s forces into his defensive positions. Obregon ordered his forces to retreat; the Villistas took the bait and pursued the Constitutionalists back towards their prepared positions at Celaya.

As Villa&#x27;s forces attacked the enemy defenses, their advance was halted by Obregon&#x27;s machine guns and artillery. Instead of using his cavalry to outmaneuver the enemy defenses, Villa ordered his troops to launch wave after wave of frontal assaults against Obregón&#x27;s positions. After the battle, Obregón recalled that the Villistas launched nearly 40 assaults with only a single penetration of his own lines. Even this minor success was thwarted by a quick-thinking Obregón. As the Villistas occupied the defensive positions they had captured, Obregón ordered his bugler to sound general retreat. The Villistas, believing the order to have come from their own bugler, were fooled into retreating and surrendered the only ground they had gained during the fighting. As Villa&#x27;s men retreated, Obregón seized the opportunity and ordered a devastating counterattack.

In addition to his battle-weary forces, Obregón also called in his reserve, which pushed the Villistas back to their own lines. In a stroke of good fortune for Obregón, the Villistas’ supply of ammunition for their small arms had run low after the day&#x27;s fighting. In the middle of the retreat, one of Villa&#x27;s commanders defected to the Constitutionalists and opened fire on Villa&#x27;s troops. By a series of good tactical decisions and considerable luck, Obregón had won the first battle of Celaya.

===Aftermath===
The results of the first battle were not catastrophic or conclusive for either side. Importantly, however, Villa was dealt his first major military setback as a commander. Despite that, morale among the Villistas was still high and they were prepared to re-engage the Constitutionalists. Villa was quick to place the blame for the day&#x27;s defeat on his lack of ammunition and resupply. This fact, combined with his failure to maintain a reserve force and his playing into the hands of Obregón by engaging on the battleground Obregon had chosen, is a more realistic appraisal of the defeat.

Villa consulted his staff, who understood that they would need to attempt to either outmaneuver Obregón or force him out of his defensive position. According to Friedrich Katz, Villa sent a letter to Obregón asking him to abandon Celaya in the hope that civilian casualties could be avoided. Obregón declined Villa&#x27;s invitation, clearly understanding Villa&#x27;s real intention to deceive him into abandoning his advantageous defense position. Villa&#x27;s appeal proved popular with foreigners in Celaya, who feared the damage the Villista artillery would wreak on the city.

==Second battle==

===Preparation===

Both sides resupplied to their best ability for the ensuing battle they knew would come, as neither side was going to retreat. However, ammunition was running low on both sides of the battlefield. Obregón wisely calculated that Villa would not attempt to bypass his defenses. In preparation, Obregón ordered his men to place much more barbed wire along potential Villista avenues of approach and cover the obstacles with additional machine-gun fire. Understanding the critical impact his reserve force had had earlier, Obregón ordered Gen. Cesareo Castro to lead a nearly 6,000-man cavalry force to conceal themselves in a nearby wooded area. The Villistas did not observe the force being positioned and were to be surprised by a reserve element. In addition to their military advantages, Obregón&#x27;s men were emboldened by their resounding earlier defeat of the Villista forces. Villa himself was a victim of his earlier successes. He knew that his own prestige and the prestige of his army was at stake and they had to attack Obregón wherever they found him. Despite being low on ammunition, with morale dropping and at a tactical disadvantage, Villa&#x27;s forces prepared to attack.

===Battle===

The second battle of Celaya began on April 13, 1915, with a massive frontal assault by the Villista cavalry on the Constitutionalist defensive lines. As in the first battle, the Villista cavalry was repeatedly driven back again and again by the overwhelming machine-gun fire from Obregón&#x27;s trenches. The Villistas continued this tactic for nearly two days as their cavalry and infantry conducted assault after assault on the trenches, each time meeting defeat. Even after the Villista artillery attempted to weaken the enemy&#x27;s defenses with artillery barrages, the defenses continued to repulse every Villista attack.

However, all was not well with Obregón&#x27;s forces. After days of fighting and limited resupply, their ammunition supply was running dangerously low. So precarious was their logistical situation that Obregón wrote an urgent telegram to President Carranza on the second day of fighting on April 14, 1915: “I have the honor of telling you that the fighting has become desperate. We have no reserves of ammunition and we only have sufficient bullets to fight for a few hours more. We will undertake every effort to save the situation.” After receiving the message, Carranza immediately dispatched a train loaded with munitions to Obregón at Celaya. This resupply was critical to continue the fight against Villa&#x27;s massive numbers of soldiers. As Villa&#x27;s troops were exhausted after nearly 48 hours of combat, Obregón sprang his reserve cavalry force from the north and counterattacked as he had done in the previous battle. With a larger, more mobile reserve force, the attack was completely devastating to the Villistas and a full retreat ensued. Obregón sealed his victory at Celaya by ordering his forces to completely drive the Villistas from the field.

===Aftermath===

While Villa and his senior staff had escaped, Obregón had won a nearly total victory for the Constitutionalists. Many of the Villista junior officers were not as fortunate as their senior commanders and were captured or surrendered to Obregón&#x27;s forces. Obregón ordered all of the 120 officers his men had captured to be executed. In addition to capturing many of the Villistas’ experienced officers, the Constitutionalists also captured thousands of small arms and ammunition, hundreds of horses and dozens of almost irreplaceable artillery pieces.

==Subsequent events==
Following the battle at Celaya, Obregón sent a telegram to President Carranza saying, “Fortunately, Villa led the attack personally” explaining his victory against Villa. Estimates of casualties on both sides vary widely, as Villa attempted to soften the blow of his defeat after the battle. The Battle of Celaya is referred to by some historians of the period as Pancho Villa&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo&quot; in the sense that he was dealt a crippling military defeat. Irreparable damage was done to both his military power and his critical aura of invincibility. Further, a number of domestic and foreign observers of the revolution came to the conclusion that the Villistas were not capable of defeating the Constitutionalist army.

Militarily, the Villistas were never again as strong as they were before taking the field at Celaya in April 1915. As a result of the disastrous battle, Villa himself was forced to go on the defensive in an attempt to reorganize his forces and procure war materiel lost at Celaya. His faithful adviser Gen. Felipe Angeles argued that Villa should return to northern Mexico, where he had allies and could reconstruct the División del Norte.

Villa, displaying supreme confidence in his military judgement, decided to conduct a defensive battle at León similar to what Obregón had done at Celaya. Obregón himself continued his to pursue his destruction of Villa in the ensuing battles of the revolution. At the battle of León, Obregón lost his right arm in the fighting and nearly died. 

The location of the battle of Celaya is in the immediate vicinity of the present-day city of Celaya, Guanajuato, Mexico. The site of the battlefield is currently not commemorated by any official major monument or museum. In Mexico City there is a monument to Obregón on the site where he was assassinated in 1928; until 1986, the monument contained Obregón&#x27;s arm, which he lost at León, preserved in formaldehyde.

The battle of Celaya would prove to be Villa&#x27;s last major contribution in the civil war as he was no longer a powerful leader. Thus, the United States began to shift their support to the victorious constitutionalists and forcing Villa to go on the run.

<text>Esox is a genus of freshwater fish commonly known as pike or pickerel. It is the type genus of the family Esocidae. The type species of the genus is &quot;Esox lucius&quot;, the northern pike. 

&quot;Esox&quot; have a fossil record extending back to the Paleocene. Modern large pike species are native to the Palearctic and Nearctic realms, ranging across Northern America and from Western Europe to Siberia in North Asia.

Pike have the elongated, torpedo-like shape typical of predatory fishes, with sharply pointed heads and sharp teeth. Their coloration is typically grey-green with a mottled or spotted appearance with stripes along their backs, providing camouflage among underwater weeds, and each individual pike marking patterns are unique like fingerprints. Pikes can grow to a maximum recorded length of , reaching a maximum recorded weight of 67lb 8oz.

==Etymology==

The generic name &quot;Esox&quot; (pike fish) derives from the Greek ἴσοξ (&quot;ee-soks&quot;, a large fish) and appears to be cognate with Celtic, Welsh &quot;eog&quot; and Irish Gaelic &quot;iasc&quot; (fish), as well as alpine Gaulic &quot;*esosk&quot; which is consistent with the original indoeuropean root for the common word for fish, &quot;*pei(k)sk&quot;. Pliny uses the Latin form &quot;Esox&quot; in reference to a large fish in the Rhine normally identified with Salmonidae (&quot;lax&quot; or salmon). Carolus Linnæus attributes &quot;Esox&quot; to the pike fish which is of similar form and appearance but taxonomically different from the salmon forms, whereas the first mention of &quot;Esox&quot; as a marine animal appears in the writings of Hesychius.

The English common name &quot;pike&quot; is an apparent shortening of &quot;pike-fish&quot;, in reference to its pointed head, as the Old English word &quot;píc&quot; originally referring to a pickaxe. The plural of pike is also pike.

A Northern English and Lowland Scots name for the pike, &quot;ged&quot;, similarly derives from Old Norse &quot;gaddr&quot; (spike) (cf. the modern Swedish name for the pike, &quot;gädda&quot;, the Danish &quot;gedde&quot;, the Norwegian &quot;gjedde&quot; and Scottish Gaelic: &quot;geadais&quot;). The Dutch name for the pike (&quot;snoek&quot;) has been given to a wide variety of fish reminding sailors of the pike (see snoek, snook).

The English &quot;pike&quot; originally referred specifically to the adult fish, the diminutive form &quot;pickerel&quot; (now used to name some of the smaller pike species, e.g. &quot;E. americanus&quot; and &quot;E. niger&quot;) referring to the young. The walleye (&quot;Sander vitreus&quot;) is sometimes called a pickerel or a walleyed pike, but it is unrelated to the pike, being a member of the perch family (Percidae). Pike are not to be confused with the unrelated pikeminnows of genus &quot;Ptychocheilus&quot; (family Cyprinidae) or pikeperch (&quot;Sander lucioperca&quot;) which is more akin to walleye than to pike. Pike are also called &quot;jackfish&quot; in North America and informally &quot;slough shark&quot; in Western Canada.

==Species==
Currently, seven recognized species are placed in this genus:
Hybrids between &quot;Esox masquinongy&quot; and &quot;Esox lucius&quot; are well-known and referred to as the tiger muskellunge.

===Fossil species===

The oldest fossil species of &quot;Esox&quot; is &quot;Esox tiemani&quot;, from the late Paleocene aged Paskapoo Formation of Canada, which differs little from modern species. Other fossil species include &quot;Esox kronneri&quot;, from the Eocene of the Green River formation, and &quot;Esox nogaicus&quot;, is known from the Pleistocene of Ukraine, and species from the Miocene (&quot;Esox sibiricus&quot;) and Pliocene (&quot;Esox moldavicus&quot;) deposits from Ukraine, Poland, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Moldavia. Two additional fossil species, both from the Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada, are placed in their own genera: &quot;Estesesox foxi&quot; (Santonian to Campanian), and &quot;Oldmanesox canadensis&quot; (Campanian to Maastrichtian).

==Diet==

Pike feed on a wide range of food sources, predominantly smaller shoal fish. Pike are also cannibalistic, sometimes preying upon smaller members of their own species. This can be seen clearly in the northern pike.

They will also prey on insects and amphibians such as newts or frogs in times when their usual food is scarce, and occasionally on small mammals like moles or mice when caught water-borne. Small birds such as ducklings may become a target for hungry pike. Pike are also known to prey on swimming snakes.

They are, however, undeserving of their reputation for being overly vicious predators. There have been some incidents of pike &quot;attacks&quot; on people. Pike&#x27;s further reputation as a pest seems to lie predominantly amongst a small handful of anglers and fishery managers who think that invasive species of 
pike are a threat to native rough fish and also other sport fish.

==Angling and handling methods ==

Effective methods for catching this hard-fighting fish include dead baits, live baits, and lure fishing. Pike can easily be damaged when handled since they are not as robust as their reputation would suggest and have a very sensitive slime coat. Since pike have numerous sharp teeth it is wise to take extreme care when unhooking them. The use of a wet leather gauntlet and surgical forceps to remove hooks is highly recommended on safety grounds.

If practicing catch and release fishing, care for the pike should be the pike angler&#x27;s utmost concern. The formerly recommended practice of grasping a pike by its eye sockets (misinterpreted as &quot;its eyes&quot;) resulted in numerous released pike that quickly died from the inability to see prey any longer. The current recommended method of grasping pike is to close the hand firmly over the gill covers, and to make the period of handling as short as possible before release. Grabbing a pike by the gill covers is not feasible when a pike is very big, but it is easy to handle a pike by inserting the fingers at the bottom of the gill opening and grabbing the lower jaw. Big pike should also be supported at the belly. When a pike is held this way it is also easier to keep the mouth open to remove a hook. Some anglers now use special grips to grab the pike&#x27;s front lower jaw, which can add to the safety of an angler because of the danger imposed by the hooks of the lure or tackle and the pike&#x27;s teeth. However, these can cause serious damage to a pike&#x27;s lower jaw. The Pike Anglers Club was formed in 1977 to campaign for the preservation of pike and the sport of pike fishing.

Pike are susceptible to &quot;gut hooking&quot; when fished for with natural bait. Upon taking the bait, the pike will hold it for a short time in its mouth as it moves off. The pike will then, usually, turn the bait in its mouth, so that it sits in alignment with its throat to ease swallowing. It is recommended that when pike fishing the process is not allowed to go this far and a strike is recommended as soon as a bite is indicated. Otherwise, what is known as &quot;gut hooking&quot; will result, which will normally kill or seriously injure the fish. Dutch research shows that cutting the line immediately when the fish is gut hooked will still give low mortality (14%). The hooks in the gut or stomach were either encapsulated or removed from the body. Placing hooks near the rear of the bait reduces the risk of deep hooking. To minimize injury from gut hooking the hook should be taken out from the gills where you will insert your pliers or forceps. Grab as close to the base of the hook as you can and rotate the eye of the hook toward the bottom of the fish&#x27;s mouth and be removed carefully as to not rehook the fish.

Other methods of catching and handling pike that are now frowned upon are the gaff and the gag. The gaff is a metal hook on the end of a pole used to hook through the fish&#x27;s body in place of a more humane landing net. A gag is a device for holding open the pike&#x27;s mouth whilst unhooking. These are now illegal in Scotland, as they put a huge amount of pressure on a pike&#x27;s jaw, thus causing irreparable damage.

===Cuisine===

The taste of pike and pickerel is highly esteemed, but the &quot;multitude of long, fine, forked bones&quot; are problematic.
 The dish of &quot;quenelles de brochet&quot; (pike dumplings), which puts the meat through a sieve, was invented to deal with this. Indeed, Escoffier believed, falsely, that &quot;quenelles&quot; had completely displaced the whole fish from the menu.

==Submarines and tanks==
Two United States Navy submarines have been named &quot;Pike&quot; – SS-6 of 1903 and SS-173 of 1935 – and three – SS-22 of 1912, SS-177 of 1936, and SS-524 of 1944 – named &quot;Pickerel&quot;. In addition, the Soviet submarines known to NATO as the Victor III class and Akula class are called the &quot;Shchuka&quot; (Щука, &quot;pike&quot;) class in Russian. The Soviet Iosif Stalin tank (IS-3) was also nicknamed &quot;Shchuka&quot;, in reference to its sharply pointed hull front.

== Cultural significance ==
=== Mythology ===
Russian mythology holds that the pike is one of several forms assumed by evil water spirits called vodyanoy, and a ravenous mythical pike is traditionally blamed for decimating the fish population in the Sheksna River. Russian fairy tales, on the other hand, also tell about an old wise pike that can fulfil wishes of the one who catches it, if its catcher releases it back into its habitat.

In the Finnish &quot;Kalevala&quot;, Väinämöinen creates a kantele (string instrument) from the jawbone of a pike.

===Heraldry===
In heraldry, the pike is called a lucy (English heraldry) or a ged (Scottish heraldry). It is usually blazoned either &quot;naiant&quot; (swimming), &quot;embowed&quot; (bowed) or &quot;hauriant&quot; (jumping), though pairs of lucies may appear &quot;addorsed&quot; (back to back), as in the arms of the Finnish town of Uusikaupunki (&quot;Argent, two lucies addorsed azure&quot;).

=== Literature ===
In George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of epic fantasy novels, both the seat and the highborn bastards of the Iron Islands are named &quot;Pyke&quot;, likely inspired by the pike fish since the islands are inhabited by Viking-like seafaring warriors who frequent pirate ships and raid the coastal regions.

<text>Spirit Airlines, Inc. is an American ultra-low cost airline headquartered in Dania Beach, Florida, in the Miami metropolitan area. Spirit operates scheduled flights throughout the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Spirit was the seventh largest passenger carrier in North America as well as the largest ultra-low-cost carrier in North America. Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2024.

== History ==


=== Foundation and early years ===
The company started as Clippert Trucking Company in 1964. In 1974, the company changed its name to Ground Air Transfer, Inc. In 1983, the airline service was founded in Macomb County, Michigan, by Ned Homfeld as Charter One Airlines, a Detroit-based charter tour operator providing travel packages to entertainment destinations such as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Bahamas.

=== 1990s ===
In May 1992, Charter One brought jet aircraft into the fleet and changed its name to Spirit Airlines. Scheduled flights between Detroit and Atlantic City began on June 1, 1992. Scheduled flights between Boston and Providence began on June 15, 1992.

In April 1993, Spirit Airlines began scheduled service to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and St. Petersburg, Florida. Flights between Atlantic City and Fort Myers, Florida, began in September 1993. Service at Philadelphia began in 1994. During the next five years, Spirit expanded further, increasing service from Detroit and adding service in new markets such as Myrtle Beach, Los Angeles, and New York City.

In the summer of 1994, Spirit Airlines overbooked flights, and 1,400 customers&#x27; tickets were canceled. The overbooking occurred because Spirit Airlines had given incorrect instructions to travel agents, causing those tickets not to be valid, even though the customers had paid for the flights. In response to criticism, Spirit Airlines said it would make sure all paid customers would always be able to fly to their destination, even if Spirit Airlines had to book them on a competitor&#x27;s airline.

In 1996, Janet Patton became Spirit Airlines&#x27; first female pilot. In 1998, she became the first female captain. At the time, Spirit was utilizing DC-9 and MD-80 aircraft.

Spirit initially had their headquarters in the Kennedy Building located in Eastpointe, Michigan, formerly East Detroit, in Metro Detroit. It relocated its headquarters in December 1999, moving to Miramar, Florida, in the Miami metropolitan area. Prior to the decision to move the headquarters to Miramar, Spirit considered Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Detroit, Michigan.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fined Spirit Airlines $67,000 for violating federal regulations on cabin and seat markings and placards. Discrepancies were found in the marking and placarding of emergency equipment, passenger seats, storage areas and doors on eight of Spirit&#x27;s DC-9 and MD-80 aircraft.

In November 2001, Spirit inaugurated service to San Juan, Puerto Rico. They implemented a fully integrated Spanish-language customer service plan, including a website and dedicated reservation line.

In the fall of 2003, Spirit resumed flights to Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which were suspended after the September 11 attacks. Spirit began service to Grand Cayman, San Francisco, and Boston in 2006. In 2007, Spirit filed DOT applications to offer service to Costa Rica, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, and Venezuela.

In January 2005, Ben Baldanza was hired as the President of Spirit, with the goal of making the company profitable. In 2006, following an investment by Indigo Partners, Baldanza was elevated to the CEO role and held the position for 10 years. This included a complete transformation of the business model and a public offering in 2011.

In 2006, Spirit exercised options to order 30 Airbus A320-200 aircraft for further expansion. Deliveries began in March 2010.

In June 2008, Spirit Airlines made a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice) application to potentially relocate or lay off hundreds of pilots and flight attendants, and the closure of their San Juan and LaGuardia crew bases. In September 2008, Spirit began placing advertisements on the side of aircraft, overhead bins, tray tables, seatback inserts and bulkheads.

In May 2009, after more than four years of inconclusive negotiations between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), Spirit pilots overwhelmingly (98% of votes) voted in favor of strike action over compensation, work rules, and benefits. At that time, Spirit pilots were among the lowest-paid Airbus pilots in the United States. On June 12, 2010, Spirit grounded its flights when its unionized pilots walked out on strike, stranding thousands of passengers. This was the first passenger airline strike by American ALPA-represented pilots since Comair in 2001.

On June 15, negotiations between the airline and ALPA resumed. A tentative agreement was reached late in the evening on June 16. The tentative agreement, which Spirit pilots later ratified by a 74%, brought Spirit pilots&#x27; compensation and benefits in line with comparable Airbus operators in the US. Flights resumed on June 18.

In 2007, Spirit Plus was rebranded as &quot;Big Front Seat&quot; and business class service was discontinued. For an additional fee, a person could choose &quot;Big Front Seat&quot;, or upgrade at the airport. In December 2010, Spirit Airlines introduced the Free Spirit World MasterCard.

=== 2010s ===
In April 2010, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. airline to charge passengers for carry-on bags. They were later followed by Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines.

In April 2012, Spirit refused to refund a terminally ill American military veteran, who had purchased a non-refundable ticket between Florida and Atlantic City before receiving orders from his doctor not to fly. The decision caused outrage among veterans&#x27; groups and the general public, some of whom threatened to boycott Spirit unless both a refund and apology were issued. In May, Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza apologized for how the situation was handled and personally refunded the man&#x27;s ticket. The airline made a $5,000 donation to the Wounded Warrior Project in his name.

In August 2013, Spirit reached an agreement on a new five-year deal with the Transport Workers Union of America, who represent the airline&#x27;s flight dispatchers.

In November 2014, Morgan Stanley named Spirit the top growth airline pick for investors.

In January 2016, former AirTran CEO Robert L. Fornaro replaced Baldanza as CEO. This prompted rumors of a merger with Frontier Airlines, which would have created the largest ultra-low-cost carrier in the Americas. Fornaro announced the airline would be teaming up with the Disney Institute to &quot;create a common purpose and a fresh set of service standards&quot;, and changing policies internally to create a more welcoming environment.

In November 2017, Spirit&#x27;s on-time performance was second in the country, behind only Delta Air Lines, a significant improvement from December 2015, when it ranked last among thirteen airlines with 68.7% of flights arriving on time. In February 2018, Spirit was the only airline in North America to make the list of the top 10 safest in the world.

In May 2018, Spirit announced that they would be the first ultra-low-cost carrier to fit their aircraft with high-speed WiFi access that started in the fall of 2018. All of their aircraft were expected to be equipped with WiFi by summer 2019.

In October 2019, Spirit Airlines announced plans to move their headquarters to Dania Beach, Florida. The new complex was planned to be around 500,000 square feet and will be equipped with flight simulators. The plans were changed in 2021 for the 6-story headquarters to be around 180,222 square feet, the training facility to be around 100,000 square feet and the parking garage to have 998 spaces.

In December 2019, Spirit Airlines announced its intention to purchase 100 new Airbus A320neo family aircraft. A February 2020 fleet plan outlines 293 aircraft planned by 2027.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Spirit Airlines received $334 million in aid in the form of grants and loans via the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES). The money was used to fund employees until September 30. In July 2020, the company announced that it would put 20–30% of its employees on leave of absence in October. In August, some pilots and flight attendants agreed to take a voluntary leave of absence or have their work schedule temporarily reduced to avoid layoffs.

In July 2020, a passenger died of COVID-19 on a Spirit Airlines flight. Spirit Airlines claimed it notified the Centers for Disease Control but there was no record of the contact. Passengers on the flight were not informed that they were around an infected individual.

In July–August 2022, Spirit&#x27;s inflight Internet service, provided by Thales&#x27; FlytLIVE, transitioned to a new satellite to provide &quot;the fastest Wi-Fi service of any US-based airline&quot;. The SES-17 high-throughput satellite from operator SES provides A320 and A321 passengers across all Spirit routes with connection speeds of up to 400 Mbit/s throughout their flight.

In August 2023, the airline converted an order for 31 Airbus A319neo into the larger A321neo. Spirit&#x27;s order made up a third of all A319neo orders, questioning the type&#x27;s future.

On January 14, 2025, it was reported that Spirit Airlines will introduce new routes along with some seasonal routes for spring break.

On January 16, 2025, Spirit Airlines laid off 200 employees to reduce costs. On January 24, 2025, Spirit Airlines updated its dress code, stating that a passenger can be denied boarding if they wear inappropriate clothing and/or offensive tattoos.

=== Attempted mergers and bankruptcy ===
In February 2022, Frontier Airlines announced its intention to acquire Spirit, pending regulatory approval, with Frontier Airlines stock as the surviving entity. The deal would make the combined airline the fifth largest airline in the U.S. In July 2022, Spirit&#x27;s shareholders rejected Frontier&#x27;s offer.

In April 2022, JetBlue proposed to acquire Spirit for $33 per share in cash, equivalent to $3.6 billion. In May, Spirit said its board of directors has decided not to consider JetBlue&#x27;s proposal. According to Spirit Airlines, JetBlue&#x27;s proposed acquisition would be unlikely to be approved by the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division, because it would likely believe that an ultra-low-cost carrier being purchased by a higher-fare airline would increase fares for consumers. Spirit noted that the Antitrust Division is looking into JetBlue&#x27;s strategic partnership with American Airlines for the same reason.

In July 2022, JetBlue reached an agreement to purchase Spirit for $33.50 per share, with additional inducements for Spirit shareholders. The deal would have made the unified company the fifth-largest airline based in the United States. Spirit shareholders voted to approve the deal. The Department of Justice sued to block the deal, alleging that the merger would result in &quot;higher fares, fewer seats, and harm millions of consumers&quot;. The trial began in October 2023. Following a trial, a federal judge blocked JetBlue&#x27;s acquisition of Spirit Airlines on January 16, 2024, citing that the deal was anticompetitive towards other airline corporations and would harm consumers. As a result, Spirit Airlines&#x27; stock fell by approximately 47%, and the airline expressed concern over its future. Speculators predicted that Spirit may have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection followed by a liquidation process if the airline could not come up with a growth plan. However, on January 18, Spirit denied these speculations, stating that the company has no plans to file for bankruptcy and is currently looking for new plans to maintain its future. JetBlue ended its takeover attempt on March 4, 2024, after a federal judge ruled the move would reduce competition.

In November 2024, Spirit announced it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company&#x27;s stock dropped over 50%, and quarterly results will not be revealed due to the announcement.

On November 18, 2024, Spirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion. The company blamed mounting losses, failed merger agreements, increasing debt, and high competition. The company will continue to operate throughout the bankruptcy and expects to emerge by the beginning of 2025. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, Spirit Airlines will be delisted from the NYSE.

In January 2025, Frontier Airlines again offered to purchase the airline. Spirit rejected the offer of $2.1 billion in stock and cash, which would have also required Spirit&#x27;s creditors to invest $350 million. The deal was significantly less than the $2.9 billion merger the airlines announced in early 2022. Despite rejecting the initial offer, Spirit said it would welcome further negotiations with Frontier.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Ownership ===
Spirit Airlines, Inc., is a Delaware corporation that was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange until its bankruptcy filing in 2024 ().

=== Headquarters ===
In 2019 the airline announced that it would move to a new headquarters of up to in the Dania Pointe development in Dania Beach, Florida, spending $250 million. The airline anticipates that it will house 1,000 employees. This headquarters opened for business in April of 2024. It is located in the Dania Pointe complex.

Spirit formerly its headquarters at 2800 Executive Way, Miramar, Florida. It moved there from its previous Eastpointe location in 1999. there were 600 employees located in the office. Chris Sloan of &quot;Airways Magazine&quot; stated that the building was &quot;nondescript low slung&quot;. Sloan added that the interior, prior to a 2014 renovation, was, &quot;To put it charitably, [...] a dump&quot;, but that employees felt ownership over the office.

=== Business model ===

Under CEO Ben Baldanza, Spirit began a transition to an ultra-low-cost carrier, following a fare model involving charging for amenities that are often included in the base ticket price of traditional carriers. Passengers who wanted to customize their itinerary or seat selection paid an add-on fee for each additional feature, which enabled the carrier to earn ancillary revenue in excess of 40% of total revenue. These included having an agent print a boarding pass at check-in versus doing it online or at a kiosk, for any large carry-on or checked bags, progressive fees for overweight bags, selected seat assignments, travel insurance, and more.

=== Frequent-flyer program ===
Spirit Airlines&#x27; has a three-tier frequent-flyer program called &quot;Free Spirit&quot;.

=== Controversy ===
Spirit Airlines has been the subject of numerous complaints, and to punitive actions by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). Most of the claims against the company were for allegations of deceptive advertising practices, customer service, and the airline&#x27;s policies for charging additional fees at the time of purchase:
* In November 2011, the DOT fined Spirit $43,900 for alleged deceptive advertising practices. The complaint claimed that the airline had been running an advertising campaign which promoted specific discounted fares on billboards, posters, and Twitter, but did not disclose full details regarding extra fees added onto the advertised rates.
* In January 2012, the DOT fined Spirit $100,000 for mishandling of complaints related to its treatment of customers with disabilities.
* In 2013, and 2015, the DOT received more passenger complaints about Spirit than any other airline. The rate of complaints was &quot;dramatically higher&quot; than the overall rate for the industry.
* In February 2018, a 21-year-old passenger flushed her hamster down an airport bathroom, after the company refused to let her take the hamster on the flight. The passenger was misinformed by a reservation representative that she could bring the emotional support animal. She claimed that a flight attendant suggested that she flush the hamster down the toilet. The airline spokesperson said that nobody had told her or suggested that she flush the hamster down the toilet.
* On August 3, 2021, Spirit Airlines cancelled 40% of its flights, leaving travelers stranded because it had no arrangements with other airlines to book its passengers on other airlines&#x27; flights. Spirit Airlines said, &quot;We&#x27;re working around the clock to get back on track in the wake of some travel disruptions over the weekend due to a series of weather and operational challenges. We needed to make proactive cancellations to some flights across the network, but the majority of flights are still scheduled as planned.&quot; By August 10, the schedule was stabilizing.
* In June 2023, a passenger was forced to urinate on the floor of a galley after a flight attendant denied her bathroom access for over two hours. The flight attendant filmed the incident and called the smell of her urine offensive. Meanwhile, the guest pleaded with the crew to allow her to use the bathroom which they continually refused.

<doc id="446448" wikidata="Q7801533" url="?curid=446448" title="Tiger muskellunge">
<text>The tiger muskellunge (&quot;Esox masquinongy&quot; × &quot;lucius&quot; or &quot;Esox lucius&quot; × &quot;masquinongy&quot;), commonly called tiger muskie, is a carnivorous fish, and is the usually sterile, hybrid offspring of the true muskellunge (&quot;Esox masquinongy&quot;) and the northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;). It lives in fresh water and its range extends to Canada, the Northeast, and the Midwest United States. It grows quickly; in one study, tiger muskie grew 1.5 times as fast as muskellunge. Like other hybrid species, tiger muskie are said to have &quot;hybrid vigor,&quot; meaning they grow faster and stronger than the parent fish, and are also less susceptible to disease. Trophy specimens weigh about . Its main diet is fish and small birds. The tiger muskie and the muskie are called the fish of 10,000 casts due to the challenge involved in catching them.

==Distribution==
The tiger muskie lives in the lakes and quiet rivers in Canada, the Great Lakes, the Upper Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio and St. Lawrence Rivers. It is found the most in Michigan. It is rarely found far from its natural waters except for stocked fish. Several states, including Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Washington, Massachusetts, Arkansas, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming stock tiger muskies. Tiger muskie were once stocked in Michigan, but are no longer raised in Michigan state fish hatcheries. Each tiger muskie tends to inhabit the same areas of its lake from year to year. It tends toward shallower waters ( deep) and travels half as much in the summer and fall as it does in the winter to spring, when it prefers deeper waters ( deep).

==Characteristics==
The tiger muskie is the result of the true muskellunge (&quot;Esox masquinongy&quot;) and the northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) interbreeding. The tiger muskie has some of the characteristics of both fish. Tiger muskie, like pike and muskellunge, have long, cylindrical-shaped bodies. Their dorsal and ventral fins are located far back near the tail and are lobe-shaped. The caudal fins of the tail are more rounded than those of true muskies. They have skinny and compressed heads and the bottom jaw is elongated with an upward curve, known as a duckbill-shape. Its pattern is varying amounts of color with vertical dark stripes and spots on a light background, the opposite color scheme of a northern pike. The tiger muskie has 5 or 6 chin pores per side on the lower jaw.

==Diet==
The tiger muskie feeds as the northern pike and muskellunge do, by waiting near weeds and ambushing its prey. They have food preferences similar to those of the true muskie and northern pike as well. Their diet changes seasonally, due to a slower metabolism in the winter and spring months. Its varied diet includes yellow perch, suckers, golden shiners, walleye, smallmouth bass, and various other types of fish. When fish are not readily available tiger muskies will feed on crayfish, frogs, young waterfowl, muskrats, mice, and other small mammals.

==Growth and survival==

State-record tiger muskie catches are recorded as depending on the state, with northern states yielding larger specimens.

Because tiger muskies are bred for stocking purposes, studies have been made of its growth rate and the factors that affect it. The growth rate of juveniles depends on the water temperature and the type of feed. In studies, the tiger muskie has had the highest growth, production, and food conversion efficiency at temperatures of . Below these temperatures, growth rates slow and above them cannibalism increases.

Several studies have examined the effect of stocking size on survival of stocked tiger muskellunge. This information helps those involved in wildlife management to make cost-effective decisions about breeding and stocking programs. Larger size at stocking has been correlated with higher survival rates and the effect is large enough that it is usually cost-effective to stock larger juveniles (180 – 205 mm)

As tiger muskies grow longer, they increase in weight. The nonlinear relationship between total length (L, in inches) and total weight (W, in pounds) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form: formula_1

Invariably, &quot;b&quot; is close to 3.0 for all species, and &quot;c&quot; is a constant that varies among species. A relationship based on 27 populations of tiger muskie from 9 states was used to develop a specific equation for tiger muskie and computed that &quot;c&quot; = 0.00008035 and &quot;b&quot; = 3.337. This relationship predicts that a tiger muskie will weigh about , and a tiger muskie will weigh about .

==Reproduction==
Cross-breeding of the true muskellunge and the northern pike occurs naturally in the wild where both parent species occur. The tiger muskie is sterile, which is not unusual for a hybrid fish. Breeders prefer to breed male northern pike and female muskellunge, because the eggs are less adhesive and have less tendency to clump when hatching. While some tiger muskie occur naturally, most are bred in hatcheries. Tiger muskie usually grow more quickly than the pure-strain muskie and northern pike in the first several years. They can also endure high temperatures better than the parent fish and they grow more quickly, reaching legal size sooner and making them more useful in stocking.

==Angling==
The tiger muskie is stocked regularly in some lakes, and people go to great lengths to obtain a tiger muskie, but it is not an easy fish to catch. Some people say that it takes 10,000 casts to catch one. The current International Game Fish Association (IGFA) all-tackle world record tiger muskie is a specimen that was caught on July 16, 1919, by John Knobla at Lac Vieux-Desert, Michigan, while the current IGFA all-tackle length world record, pending , is a individual caught on May 20, 2024, by angler Daniel Caricaburu-Lundin in Ackley Lake, Hobson, Montana.
===Sport===
The tiger muskie is renowned as a sport fish because it can reach sizes over long. They can be caught in lakes and reservoirs in locations with plenty of forage. Being large, powerful fish, they can be difficult to manage. The best way to catch a tiger muskie is to get the fish to the side of the boat as quickly as possible so the fish does not become exhausted; this is especially important during the summer months. Using a large landing net, scoop the fish onto the boat making sure it does not flop around too much; fish often hurt themselves by thrashing wildly in boats. Quickly grip over the top of the gill plates, but be careful of the gills because they can tear easily and are very sharp. Make sure to use pliers when removing the hook because tiger muskies have many sharp teeth.

Like many other predatory fish, muskies like to hide in the edge of weed beds so they can ambush prey. They can also be found in areas where they have quick access to open parts of the lake. Unlike other fish muskies seem to feed when the weather and atmospheric pressure stay consistent, rain or shine. Catching tiger muskie is usually done by trolling at speeds between 4 and 6 miles per hour, but they have been caught trolling faster and slower.

Contrary to popular folklore, muskie will hit at any size fishing lure: the lure does not have to be huge. The lure size should vary depending on the amount of weeds in the area or at the depth you wish to fish. In open water, larger lures such as Jointed Rapalas, Loke Lures, Ziggy Lures, Willy Lures, Wiley Lures, Large Mepps Bucktails, Muskie Plugs, large spinner baits or long shallow running Rapalas can be effective. Usually, Fire-Tiger and Perch-color work best during the day time and red lures work better in the evening.

When fishing in weeds it is better to use smaller lures. Original Floating Rapalas, or Thundersticks work very well. Smaller Jointed Rapalas and smaller spinner baits are effective too.

<text>Aberdeen is a town in Saskatchewan, Canada. Located 18 minutes north-east of Saskatoon, it has a population of 716 people.

==History==

Aberdeen was first settled by immigrants of Russian, English, Scottish and Ukrainian descent in the 1890s to 1900s. In particular, these initial settlers included people born in Eastern or Atlantic Canada, largely of English or Scottish ancestry, along with Ukrainian immigrants (1898–1899) and Mennonites from Manitoba (1901).

Originally named Dueck, it was organized as the hamlet of Aberdeen in 1904. It was named in honour of Ishbel Maria Marjoribanks Gordon, Lady Aberdeen, who was the founder of the National Council of Women of Canada. In 1904, the Canadian Northern Railway reached the town. By 1908, the railway had become critical for the sale of wheat, with 120 rail cars of hard wheat shipped out that year.

Business on Main Street peaked in the early 1930s, until it was largely destroyed by fire in 1937.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Aberdeen had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
== Infrastructure ==

=== Aberdeen Rec Complex ===

The Aberdeen Recreation Complex (ARC) finished construction and opened for business in the fall of 2005. The ARC is home to the AMHA Aberdeen Flames, and the Knights Senior Hockey Club. The Complex also has a professional size rink, training rink, concession and lounge, fitness centre, and meeting rooms.

=== Farm in the Dell ===

Farm in the Dell is a community-based organization supporting people with disabilities in a rural farm-like setting through residential and vocational opportunities. It currently operates one group home providing 10 residential spaces and a day program for ten people. On June 1, 2018, the Farm in the Dell celebrated the development of a five-space group home, a two-space supervised independent living program and an expansion to the day program space. The Government of Saskatchewan provided more than $525,000 in annual funding to this initiative, bringing annual funding for Farm in the Dell to more than $1.4 million.

===Water supply===

SaskWater purchases water from the city of Saskatoon and then sells the water to the town of Aberdeen, which in turn sells it to local residents. This is facilitated through the use of a $4M pipeline that was completed in 2010.

<text>A budget process refers to the process by which governments create and approve a budget, which is as follows:

* The Financial Service Department prepares worksheets to assist the department head in preparation of department budget estimates
* The Administrator calls a meeting of managers and they present and discuss plans for the following year’s projected level of activity.
* The managers can work with the Financial Services, or work alone to prepare an estimate for the departments coming year.
* The completed budgets are presented by the managers to their Executive Officers for review and approval. 
* Justification of the budget request may be required in writing. In most cases, the manager talks with their administrative officers about budget requirements. Adjustments to the budget submission may be required as a result of this phase in the process.

Budgeting is the setting of expenditure levels for each of an organization’s functions. It is the estimation and allocation of available capital used to achieve the designated targets of a firm.

== Terminology ==
* Revenue Estimation performed in the executive branch by the finance director, clerk&#x27;s office, budget director, manager, or a team.
* Budget Call issued to outline the presentation form, recommend certain goals.
* Budget Formulation reflecting on the past, set goals for the future and reconcile the difference.
* Budget Hearings can include departments, sections, the executive, and the public to discuss changes in the budget.
* Budget Adoption final approval by the legislative body.
* Budget Execution amending the budget as the fiscal year progresses.

== Constitutional economics ==

Constitutional economics is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the judiciary which in many transitional and developing countries is completely controlled by the executive. It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors. The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process, and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.

<doc id="446457" wikidata="Q399771" url="?curid=446457" title="Iron(III) chloride">
<text>Iron(III) chloride describes the inorganic compounds with the formula (H2O)x. Also called ferric chloride, these compounds are some of the most important and commonplace compounds of iron. They are available both in anhydrous and in hydrated forms, which are both hygroscopic. They feature iron in its +3 oxidation state. The anhydrous derivative is a Lewis acid, while all forms are mild oxidizing agents. It is used as a water cleaner and as an etchant for metals.

==Electronic and optical properties==

All forms of ferric chloride are paramagnetic, owing to the presence of unpaired electrons residing in 3d orbitals. Although Fe(III) chloride can be octahedral or tetrahedral (or both, see structure section), all of these forms have five unpaired electrons, one per d-orbital. The high spin d5 electronic configuration requires that d-d electronic transitions are spin forbidden, in addition to violating the Laporte rule. This double forbidden-ness results in its solutions being only pale colored. Or, stated more technically, the optical transitions are non-intense. Aqueous ferric sulfate and ferric nitrate, which contain , are nearly colorless, whereas the chloride solutions are yellow. Thus, the chloride ligands significantly influence the optical properties of the iron center.

==Structure==
Iron(III) chloride can exist as an anhydrous material and a series of hydrates, which results in distinct structures.

===Anhydrous===
The anhydrous compound is a hygroscopic crystalline solid with a melting point of 307.6 °C. The colour depends on the viewing angle: by reflected light, the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light, they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride has the  structure, with octahedral Fe(III) centres interconnected by two-coordinate chloride ligands.

Iron(III) chloride has a relatively low melting point and boils at around 315 °C. The vapor consists of the dimer , much like aluminium chloride. This dimer dissociates into the monomeric (with D3h point group molecular symmetry) at higher temperatures, in competition with its reversible decomposition to give iron(II) chloride and chlorine gas.

===Hydrates===
Ferric chloride form hydrates upon exposure to water, reflecting its Lewis acidity. All hydrates exhibit deliquescence, meaning that they become liquid by absorbing moisture from the air. Hydration invariably gives derivatives of aquo complexes with the formula . This cation can adopt either &quot;trans&quot; or &quot;cis&quot; stereochemistry, reflecting the relative location of the chloride ligands on the octahedral Fe center. Four hydrates have been characterized by X-ray crystallography: the dihydrate , the disesquihydrate , the trisesquihydrate , and finally the hexahydrate . These species differ with respect to the stereochemistry of the octahedral iron cation, the identity of the anions, and the presence or absence of water of crystallization. The structural formulas are , , , and . The first three members of this series have the tetrahedral tetrachloroferrate () anion.

===Solution===

Like the solid hydrates, aqueous solutions of ferric chloride also consist of the octahedral of unspecified stereochemistry. Detailed speciation of aqueous solutions of ferric chloride is challenging because the individual components do not have distinctive spectroscopic signatures. Iron(III) complexes, with a high spin d5 configuration, is kinetically labile, which means that ligands rapidly dissociate and reassociate. A further complication is that these solutions are strongly acidic, as expected for aquo complexes of a tricationic metal. Iron aquo complexes are prone to olation, the formation of polymeric oxo derivatives. Dilute solutions of ferric chloride produce soluble nanoparticles with molecular weight of 104, which exhibit the property of &quot;aging&quot;, i.e., the structure change or evolve over the course of days. The polymeric species formed by the hydrolysis of ferric chlorides are key to the use of ferric chloride for water treatment.

In contrast to the complicated behavior of its aqueous solutions, solutions of iron(III) chloride in diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran are well-behaved. Both ethers form 1:2 adducts of the general formula FeCl3(ether)2. In these complexes, the iron is pentacoordinate.

==Preparation==
Several hundred tons of anhydrous iron(III) chloride are produced annually. The principal method, called &quot;direct chlorination&quot;, uses scrap iron as a precursor:
The reaction is conducted at several hundred degrees such that the product is gaseous. Using excess chlorine guarantees that the intermediate ferrous chloride is converted to the ferric state. A similar but laboratory-scale process also has been described.

&quot;Aqueous&quot; solutions of iron(III) chloride are also produced industrially from a number of iron precursors, including iron oxides:

In complementary route, iron metal can be oxidized by hydrochloric acid followed by chlorination: 
:

A number of variables apply to these processes, including the oxidation of iron by ferric chloride and the hydration of intermediates. Hydrates of iron(III) chloride do not readily yield anhydrous ferric chloride. Attempted thermal dehydration yields hydrochloric acid and iron oxychloride. In the laboratory, hydrated iron(III) chloride can be converted to the anhydrous form by treatment with thionyl chloride or trimethylsilyl chloride:
:

==Reactions==
Being high spin d5 electronic configuration iron(III) chlorides are labile, meaning that its Cl- and H2O ligands exchange rapidly with free chloride and water. In contrast to their kinetic lability, iron(III) chlorides are thermodynamically robust, as reflected by the vigorous methods applied to their synthesis, as described above.

===Anhydrous FeCl3===
Aside from lability, which applies to anhydrous and hydrated forms, the reactivity of anhydrous ferric chloride reveals two trends: It is a Lewis acid and an oxidizing agent.

Reactions of anhydrous iron(III) chloride reflect its description as both oxophilic and a hard Lewis acid. Myriad manifestations of the oxophiliicty of iron(III) chloride are available. When heated with iron(III) oxide at 350 °C it reacts to give iron oxychloride:
Alkali metal alkoxides react to give the iron(III) alkoxide complexes. These products have more complicated structures than anhydrous iron(III) chloride. In the solid phase a variety of multinuclear complexes have been described for the nominal stoichiometric reaction between and sodium ethoxide:
Iron(III) chloride forms a 1:2 adduct with Lewis bases such as triphenylphosphine oxide; e.g., . The related 1:2 complex , has been crystallized from ether solution.

Iron(III) chloride also reacts with tetraethylammonium chloride to give the yellow salt of the tetrachloroferrate ion (). Similarly, combining FeCl3 with NaCl and KCl gives and , respectively.

In addition to these simple stoichiometric reactions, the Lewis acidity of ferric chloride enables its use in a variety of acid-catalyzed reactions as described below in the section on organic chemistry.

In terms of its being an oxidant, iron(III) chloride oxidizes iron powder to form iron(II) chloride via a comproportionation reaction:

A traditional synthesis of anhydrous ferrous chloride is the reduction of FeCl3 with chlorobenzene:

iron(III) chloride releases chlorine gas when heated above 160 °C, generating ferrous chloride:
To suppress this reaction, the preparation of iron(III) chloride requires an excess of chlorinating agent, as discussed above.

===Hydrated FeCl3===
Unlike the anhydrous material, hydrated ferric chloride is not a particularly strong Lewis acid since water ligands have quenched the Lewis acidity by binding to Fe(III).

Like the anhydrous material, hydrated ferric chloride is oxophilic. For example, oxalate salts react rapidly with aqueous iron(III) chloride to give , known as ferrioxalate. Other carboxylate sources, e.g., citrate and tartrate, bind as well to give carboxylate complexes. The affinity of iron(III) for oxygen ligands was the basis of qualitative tests for phenols. Although superseded by spectroscopic methods, the ferric chloride test is a traditional colorimetric test. The affinity of iron(III) for phenols is exploited in the Trinder spot test.

Aqueous iron(III) chloride serves as a one-electron oxidant illustrated by its reaction with copper(I) chloride to give copper(II) chloride and iron(II) chloride.
This fundamental reaction is relevant to the use of ferric chloride solutions in etching copper.

===Organometallic chemistry===
The interaction of anhydrous iron(III) chloride with organolithium and organomagnesium compounds has been examined often. These studies are enabled because of the solubility of FeCl3 in ethereal solvents, which avoids the possibility of hydrolysis of the nucleophilic alkylating agents. Such studies may be relevant to the mechanism of FeCl3-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. The isolation of organoiron(III) intermediates requires low-temperature reactions, lest the [FeR4]− intermediates degrade. Using methylmagnesium bromide as the alkylation agent, salts of Fe(CH3)4]− have been isolated. Illustrating the sensitivity of these reactions, methyl lithium reacts with iron(III) chloride to give lithium tetrachloroferrate(II) :
:
To a significant extent, iron(III) acetylacetonate and related beta-diketonate complexes are more widely used than FeCl3 as ether-soluble sources of ferric ion. These diketonate complexes have the advantages that they do not form hydrates, unlike iron(III) chloride, and they are more soluble in relevant solvents.
Cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide undergoes a complex reaction with iron(III) chloride, resulting in ferrocene:
This conversion, although not of practical value, was important in the history of organometallic chemistry where ferrocene is emblematic of the field.

==Uses==
=== Water treatment===
The largest applications of iron(III) chloride are sewage treatment and drinking water production. By forming highly dispersed networks of Fe-O-Fe containing materials, ferric chlorides serve as coagulant and flocculants. In this application, an aqueous solution of is treated with base to form a floc of iron(III) hydroxide (), also formulated as FeO(OH) (ferrihydrite). This floc facilitates the separation of suspended materials, clarifying the water.

Iron(III) chloride is also used to remove soluble phosphate from wastewater. Iron(III) phosphate is insoluble and thus precipitates as a solid. One potential advantage of its use in water treatment, is that the ferric ion oxidizes (deodorizes) hydrogen sulfide.

===Etching and metal cleaning===
It is also used as a leaching agent in chloride hydrometallurgy, for example in the production of Si from FeSi (Silgrain process by Elkem).

In another commercial application, a solution of iron(III) chloride is useful for etching copper according to the following equation:
The soluble copper(II) chloride is rinsed away, leaving a copper pattern. This chemistry is used in the production of printed circuit boards (PCB).

Iron(III) chloride is used in many other hobbies involving metallic objects.

===Organic chemistry===

In industry, iron(III) chloride is used as a catalyst for the reaction of ethylene with chlorine, forming ethylene dichloride (1,2-dichloroethane): 
Ethylene dichloride is a commodity chemical, which is mainly used for the industrial production of vinyl chloride, the monomer for making PVC.

Illustrating it use as a Lewis acid, iron(III) chloride catalyses electrophilic aromatic substitution and chlorinations. In this role, its function is similar to that of aluminium chloride. In some cases, mixtures of the two are used.

====Organic synthesis research====
Although iron(III) chlorides are seldom used in practical organic synthesis, they have received considerable attention as reagents because they are inexpensive, earth abundant, and relatively nontoxic. Many experiments probe both its redox activity and its Lewis acidity. For example, iron(III) chloride oxidizes naphthols to naphthoquinones: 3-Alkylthiophenes are polymerized to polythiophenes upon treatment with ferric chloride. Iron(III) chloride has been shown to promote C-C coupling reaction.

Several reagents have been developed based on supported iron(III) chloride. On silica gel, the anhydrous salt has been applied to certain dehydration and pinacol-type rearrangement reactions. A similar reagent but moistened induces hydrolysis or epimerization reactions. On alumina, ferric chloride has been shown to accelerate ene reactions.
When pretreated with sodium hydride, iron(III) chloride gives a hydride reducing agent that convert alkenes and ketones into alkanes and alcohols, respectively.

=== Histology===
Iron(III) chloride is a component of useful stains, such as Carnoy&#x27;s solution, a histological fixative with many applications. Also, it is used to prepare Verhoeff&#x27;s stain.

==Natural occurrence==
Like many metal halides, naturally occurs as a trace mineral. The rare mineral molysite is usually associated with volcanoes and fumaroles.

-based aerosol are produced by a reaction between iron-rich dust and hydrochloric acid from sea salt. This iron salt aerosol causes about 1-5% of naturally-occurring oxidization of methane and is thought to have a range of cooling effects; thus, it has been proposed as a catalyst for Atmospheric Methane Removal. 

The clouds of Venus are hypothesized to contain approximately 1% dissolved in sulfuric acid.

== Safety ==
Iron(III) chlorides are widely used in the treatment of drinking water, so they pose few problems as poisons, at low concentrations. Nonetheless, anhydrous iron(III) chloride, as well as concentrated aqueous solution, is highly corrosive, and must be handled using proper protective equipment.

<doc id="446458" wikidata="Q6929008" url="?curid=446458" title="Mr. Mulliner">
<text>Mr. Mulliner is a fictional character from the short stories of P. G. Wodehouse. Mr. Mulliner is a loquacious pub raconteur who, no matter what the topic of conversation, can find an appropriate (if improbable) story about a member of his family to match it.

Like much of Wodehouse&#x27;s work, the Mr. Mulliner stories were originally written for magazine publication. Thirty-eight of the 43 overall Mulliner stories were originally published between 1926 and 1937. After one brief 1940 anecdote, the final four stories appeared much later, being published between 1958 and 1972.

==Overview==
Like his fellow Wodehouse character, the Oldest Member, the raconteur Mr. Mulliner can turn any conversation into a &quot;recollection&quot;, or funny story. Wodehouse revealed in an introduction that he devised Mr. Mulliner after collecting notebooks full of ideas that could not be used because they were too outlandish, until he had the happy notion of a fisherman whose veracity could be doubted.

In the first Mr. Mulliner story &quot;The Truth About George&quot;, Wodehouse provides a description of Mr. Mulliner as &quot;a short, stout, comfortable man of middle age&quot; with eyes that are &quot;large and round and earnest&quot; and full of &quot;extraordinarily childlike candor.&quot; A habitué of the Angler&#x27;s Rest pub, where his fellow drinkers are identified only by their beverages, Mr. Mulliner is a &quot;hot Scotch and lemon&quot;.

The tales of Mulliner all involve one of his relations: there are dozens upon dozens of cousins, nieces, and nephews. These include stories about loves lost, found and rekindled; fortunes made and lost; and opportunities grasped or missed. They take place across the globe: Los Angeles&#x27;s Hollywood and the English country house are the settings for many.

Two Mulliner stories (&quot;Gala Night&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Minna Nordstrom&quot;) are &quot;not&quot; primarily about one of Mr. Mulliner&#x27;s relatives. However, in these two cases, Mr. Mulliner states that the stories were told to him by relatives; he is therefore reporting a story told to him by a relation, rather than a story about a relation.

==Stories==
The Mulliner stories all employ an unusual structure. At the beginning of each story, an unnamed first-person narrator sets the scene at the Angler&#x27;s Rest pub, describing the conversation at the bar-parlour. This will lead to Mr. Mulliner entering the conversation, generally elaborating on the conversational theme, and remarking that it reminds him of a story involving a relative. Then, no more than a page or two into the story, Mr. Mulliner effectively takes over the narration of the tale, describing the events that befell the relative in question. In the earlier stories, the unnamed first-person narrator returns very briefly to close out the tale back at the Angler&#x27;s Rest—in later stories, the story ends when Mr. Mulliner has concluded it.

Mr. Mulliner himself is rarely a character in the tales he tells. An exception is the story &quot;George and Alfred&quot;, in which Mr. Mulliner tries to help out one of his nephews who has been accused of a crime. In this story, we learn that Mr. Mulliner is a friend of Hollywood studio head Jacob Z. Schnellenhamer, and that he has stayed on Schnellenhamer&#x27;s yacht while it was cruising the Mediterranean. We also learn that Mr. Mulliner&#x27;s first name, whatever it may be, is not George.

Little else is revealed of Mulliner&#x27;s character beyond his large family, his choice of beverage, and his hobby of fishing (which he mentions in one story replaced his earlier hobby of golf). Nevertheless, Mulliner narrates forty-three short stories. Many are collected in the three books, containing nine stories each, which bear his name:

* &quot;Meet Mr Mulliner&quot; (1927)
* &quot;Mr Mulliner Speaking&quot; (1929)
* &quot;Mulliner Nights&quot; (1933)

Fifteen other stories are scattered in other volumes:

* Five in &quot;Blandings Castle and Elsewhere&quot; (1935)
* Three in &quot;Young Men in Spats&quot; (1936)
* One in &quot;Lord Emsworth and Others&quot; (1937)
* One in &quot;Crime Wave at Blandings&quot; (1937)
* One in &quot;Eggs, Beans and Crumpets&quot; (1940)
* Two in &quot;A Few Quick Ones&quot; (1959)
* One in &quot;Plum Pie&quot; (1966)
* One in &quot;The World of Mr Mulliner&quot; (1972)

One story -- 1940&#x27;s &quot;Shock Dogs&quot;, which is more of a brief topical conversation than a story -- has never been reprinted or collected in any form outside of its original publication in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine. It is signed with initials only (P.G.W.) but the Articles and Verse listing in the bound Punch volume CXCVIIJ Jan-June 1940 attributes the story to Wodehouse, P. G. It mentions by name Hitler, Brauchitsch, and Goebbels, which is very unusual for an author who so seldom allowed politics to impinge on his novels and stories.

&quot;The World of Mr Mulliner&quot; is an omnibus containing 41 of the 43 stories narrated by Mr. Mulliner. It omits &quot;Shock Dogs&quot;, and 1937&#x27;s &quot;Romance at Droitgate Spa&quot;, which appears in several other Wodehouse compilations but without the framework of Mr. Mulliner&#x27;s narration. &quot;The World of Mr Mulliner&quot; also includes one other story which has a tangential connection to the series: &quot;From a Detective&#x27;s Notebook&quot; (1959) is narrated by the detective Adrian Mulliner, who had previously been established as one of Mr. Mulliner&#x27;s innumerable nephews. Strictly speaking, despite its appearance in the Mr. Mulliner omnibus, this tale cannot be considered a Mr. Mulliner story, as Mr. Mulliner does not narrate it, appear in it, and is not actually referenced in it in any way.

Also note that a handful of what were to become &quot;Mr. Mulliner stories&quot; were originally published in magazines without the framework of Mr. Mulliner telling the story in question. (These include three stories about Bobbie Wickham, as well as one about James Rodman.) When revised for book publication, Wodehouse added the Mulliner openings and narration — and it is these revised versions which appear in all Mulliner and Wodehouse anthologies to this day. These revised stories can often be distinguished by Mulliner identifying the prime character of the story as a &quot;distant cousin&quot; (or some other far-flung relation) whose surname is &quot;not&quot; Mulliner.

Brown was a member of the National Party for many years but left the party in 1993, angered by what he regarded as the Fourth National Government&#x27;s betrayal of its 1990 election pledges. Instead he joined New Zealand First and stood as the party&#x27;s candidate for the seat of Kaimai at the and came a close second, reducing incumbent National MP Robert Anderson&#x27;s majority from 8,147 to just 372. He became New Zealand First&#x27;s spokesperson for transport and communications. At the he was elected to parliament as a List MP. In 1998 Brown was elected deputy leader of the party unopposed to replace Tau Henare who had been dumped from the deputy leadership a week earlier after a personality clash between Henare and party leader Winston Peters.

In April 2008, Brown – an immigrant himself – drew widespread attention after voicing similar views and expressing concern at the increase in New Zealand&#x27;s immigrant population, specifically ethnic Asians: &quot;We are going to flood this country with Asian people with no idea what we are going to do with them when they come here.&quot; &quot;The matter is serious. If we continue this open door policy there is real danger we will be inundated with people who have no intention of integrating into our society. The greater the number, the greater the risk. They will form their own mini-societies to the detriment of integration and that will lead to division, friction and resentment.&quot;

Brown left Parliament after the 2008 election in which New Zealand First lost all its seats. He was succeeded in the deputy leader role in 2009 by Tracey Martin.

==Personal life==
Brown is married and has had two children. He enjoys sport, literature, theatre and music.

<doc id="446464" wikidata="Q2604486" url="?curid=446464" title="Marvel vs. Capcom">
<text>is a series of crossover fighting games developed and published by Capcom, featuring characters from their video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The series originated as coin-operated arcade games; later releases were specifically developed for home consoles, handhelds, and personal computers.

Its gameplay borrows heavily from Capcom&#x27;s previous Marvel-licensed fighting games &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot; and &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;; however, instead of focusing on single combat, the games incorporated tag team battles. Players form teams of two or three characters and, controlling one fighter at a time, attempt to damage and knock out their opponents. Players can switch out their characters during the match, allowing team members to replenish their health and prolong their ability to fight. The series&#x27; gameplay is distinguished from other fighting game franchises due to its character assist mechanics and emphasis on aerial combat.

The &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series has received generally positive reviews from critics, who have praised its fast-paced gameplay, vibrant visuals, and wealth of playable characters. The series has enjoyed broad appeal, selling approximately 11 million units as of 2023.

==Games==

; Main Games
*X-Men vs. Street Fighter was initially released as an arcade game in 1996. The game was later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and PlayStation in 1998. It established the series&#x27; basic gameplay conventions by combining &quot;Street Fighter&quot;-style combat with tag team features. &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; also borrowed gameplay concepts from Capcom&#x27;s previous Marvel Comics-licensed fighting games, &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot; and &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;.
*Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter was released in arcades in 1997. It was then ported to the Sega Saturn in 1998 and PlayStation in 1999. The game expanded the playable roster to the larger Marvel Universe, introducing characters such as Captain America, Hulk, and Spider-Man. It was also responsible for introducing character assist moves to the franchise, a gameplay element which would influence future &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; installments.
*Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes debuted in arcades in 1998. Ports to the Dreamcast and PlayStation soon followed in 1999. Rather than strictly using &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters, the game included characters from other Capcom video game franchises, such as Mega Man, Morrigan, and Strider Hiryu. It removed the character assist feature used in &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; and implemented its own system, which randomly allocated guest characters to each player.
*Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes was released in arcades in 2000 and ported to the Dreamcast within the same year. The game received ports to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2002. It was then re-released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 through the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, respectively, in 2009. Lastly, a version for iOS devices was released in 2012. Featuring a large playable roster, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; reused the assist features from &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; and changed the series&#x27; two-on-two battle system to three-on-three fights. 
*Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. The series&#x27; traditional sprites transitioned into 3D character models while retaining the 2D-style combat. The game includes various gameplay features designed to make it more accessible to newer players, such as the additions of a comeback mechanic and a more simplified control scheme.
*Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, a standalone updated edition of the original &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;, was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360 in 2011. The game was also released for the PlayStation 4 via the PlayStation Network in 2016; releases for the Xbox One via the Xbox Live Arcade and Microsoft Windows via Steam followed in 2017. It features new characters, stages, modes, and other enhancements to improve game balance and online functionality.
*Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite was released in 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. It features two-on-two battles, similar to earlier &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; games, and removes traditional assist moves in favor of its own dual-character combo system. The game also implements a gameplay mechanic involving the Infinity Stones, which grants players unique abilities and upgrades depending on the type of stone selected. It is the first game to feature a cinematic story mode.
; Compilations
*Marvel vs. Capcom Origins, a compilation game which includes &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 through the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade, respectively, in 2012. It features high-definition visuals, online multiplayer, dynamic challenges, and unlockables.
*Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a compilation comprising all seven Capcom-developed Marvel games originally released for arcades: &quot;The Punisher&quot;, &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot;, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot;. It was released in 2024 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Windows and in 2025 for Xbox One.

In 2011, a series of Minimates based on the playable characters from &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot; were released by Art Asylum.

Udon Entertainment published &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Official Complete Works&quot; art book consisting of promotional artwork, sketches and bonus material from the video game collaborations between Marvel and Capcom, beginning with the 1993 arcade game &quot;The Punisher&quot; to &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;. It contains contributions from a variety of artists and illustrators, including Akiman, Bengus, Shinkiro, Joe Madureira, Adi Granov, Joe Ng, Long Vo, Chamba, Adam Warren and Takeshi Miyazawa. &quot;Official Complete Works&quot; made its international debut at San Diego Comic-Con on July 11, 2012, in an exclusive hardcover edition. The hardcover also featured a wrap-around cover designed by Udon Entertainment and Capcom artist Alvin Lee, and digitally-painted by Udon&#x27;s Genzoman. A standard-format softcover was released in November 2012 by Diamond Comics.

Within the Marvel Comics multiverse, the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; universe is designated as &quot;Earth-30847&quot;. The iteration of Spider-Man from the series made a cameo appearance in the second issue of the comics crossover event &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; (2014–15), where he is defeated by Morlun as he hunts all Spider-Totems across the multiverse.

==Gameplay==
The basic gameplay of the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series was originally derived from &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot; and &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;. Players compete in battle using characters with unique moves and special attacks. Using a combination of joystick movements and button presses, players must execute various moves to damage their opponent and deplete their life gauge, or alternatively, have the most cumulative health when the timer runs out. However, unlike the two aforementioned games, which focus on single combat, the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series revolve around tag team-based combat. Instead of choosing a single character, players select multiple characters to form teams of two or three. Each character on the team is given their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the others await off-screen. Players are also free to swap between their characters at any point during the match. As characters take damage, portions of their life gauge will turn red, known as &quot;red health&quot;, which represents the amount of health that a character can recover if the player tags them out. The off-screen, dormant characters will slowly replenish their red health, allowing players to cycle through their team members and prolong their ability to fight. Furthermore, as characters deal and receive damage, a colored meter at the bottom of the screen known as the &quot;Hyper Combo Gauge&quot; will gradually fill. By expending meter from their Hyper Combo Gauge, players can perform &quot;Hyper Combos&quot; – powerful, cinematic attacks that deal heavy damage to the opponent – in addition to several other special techniques. If one character loses all of their health, they are knocked out and the next available fighter will automatically come into play.

Each successive &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; installment has added, removed, or altered gameplay elements over the course of the series&#x27; history. &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; added two-on-two tag team features. &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; introduced the concept of the &quot;assist&quot; by allowing the player to summon their off-screen partner to perform a special move without switching characters. This feature was replaced in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, which instead randomly allocated an unplayable guest character with a preset assist move before each match; in addition, assists were limited to only a few uses per round. The assist features from &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; were re-incorporated into the following sequel, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot;, once again granting players the ability to call in their off-screen characters at any time during the match without constraint. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; also increased the number of characters per team by one, providing a three-on-three battle format. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot; introduced &quot;X-Factor&quot;, a comeback mechanic which offers increased damage, speed, and red health regeneration for a limited time upon activation. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; reverts to two-on-two partner battles and removes traditional character assists, in favour of a free-form tag system where the second character switches in at any point, irrespective of whether the player is mid-combo or in air. &quot;Infinite&quot; also implements the Infinity Stones as a gameplay mechanic, where each of the six stones grants unique abilities and enhancements to the player.

Another gameplay element that helps to distinguish the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series from other fighting game franchises is its emphasis on aerial combat. Every character in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series is given a &quot;Launcher&quot; move, which sends the opponent flying up into the air. The player can then choose to follow up immediately by using a &quot;Super Jump&quot;, which allows a character to jump much higher than normal, in order to continue their combo; these airborne combos are called &quot;Air Combos&quot; or &quot;Aerial Raves&quot;. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; introduced a gameplay feature known as the &quot;Team Aerial Combo&quot; or &quot;Aerial Exchange&quot;, giving players the opportunity to extend their Air Combos further by quickly tagging in their other characters while mid-air.

As Capcom&#x27;s design philosophy for the series has changed to appeal to a wider audience, the control scheme has been repeatedly modified to accommodate people less familiar with the fighting game genre. The first three installments utilized the same layout of six attack buttons, separated as three pairs of light, medium, and hard punches and kicks. In &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot;, in order to make the game more accessible, the layout was tweaked to four attack buttons, consisting of two pairs of light and heavy punches and kicks, and two dedicated assist buttons. The control scheme was further simplified with the release of &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;, which included three attack buttons designated to undefined light, medium, and hard attacks, two assist buttons, and an &quot;exchange button&quot; used to perform Launchers and switch between characters during Air Combos. In addition, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; included two different control scheme options: Normal Mode and Simple Mode. Simple Mode, designed for casual players, allows players to perform special moves and Hyper Combos with single button presses at the expense of limiting a character&#x27;s available moveset. Though &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; returned to a control scheme similar to &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; ― with four attack buttons, one dedicated button for character tagging, and another for activating Infinity Stone abilities ― it introduced a new &quot;auto-combo&quot; system to improve accessibility that allows players to repeatedly mash the light punch input to automatically execute ground and air combos without any damage penalty.

==Characters==
&quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; has featured over 100 playable fighters, primarily drawn from comic book series published by Marvel Comics and video games franchises developed and produced by Capcom. The games have introduced a few original characters, which include Norimaro from &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, and Amingo, Ruby Heart, and SonSon from &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot;. In addition to the playable cast, other characters from the Marvel and Capcom universes make appearances in the games in varying capacities. Both &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot; include secret characters which can be played by inputting specific sequences of joystick movements on the character select screen. These secret characters consist of palette swaps of existing fighters with different moveset properties. &quot;Clash of Super Heroes&quot; also has unplayable summon characters as part of its &quot;Guest Character/Special Partner&quot; assist system.

Many &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; installments also allow players to fight as the games&#x27; boss characters in special game modes, with the exception of Abyss from &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot;. Characters that have not been playable frequently make cameo appearances in the games&#x27; cutscenes and stage backgrounds. Lastly, numerous non-playable Marvel and Capcom characters are featured as &quot;Ability Cards&quot; in the Heroes and Heralds game mode in &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;. Out of all the playable characters, Ryu and Chun-Li are the only ones to have appeared in every game released thus far.

===Notes===
==History==
Capcom&#x27;s partnership with Marvel Comics began in 1993 with the release of &quot;The Punisher&quot;, an arcade beat &#x27;em up based on the comic book series of the same name. Capcom then created their first Marvel-licensed fighting game, &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot;, in 1994. &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; soon followed in 1995. Many of the gameplay mechanics used in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series were first developed and refined in these two fighting games, serving as precursors to the series. In 2011, then-current Capcom USA Strategic Marketing Director of Online and Community Seth Killian stated that many fighting game aficionados, including himself, consider them to have laid the foundation for the series.

The idea for implementing tag teams was allegedly inspired by an easter egg from Capcom&#x27;s own 1995 fighting game &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors&#x27; Dreams&quot;. In a secret &quot;Dramatic Battle&quot; mode, two players, controlling Ryu and Ken, were able to fight against an AI-controlled M. Bison at the same time. The easter egg itself had drawn inspiration from the final battle sequence of &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, which featured a similar fight scene. Recognizing the uniqueness of a team-up concept, Capcom began to work on their next project. After their earlier licensing ventures with &quot;Children of the Atom&quot; and &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, the company decided to combine Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise, their own &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise, and their team-up concept, leading to the creation of &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;. The game debuted in Japanese arcades in 1996, establishing the series&#x27; fast-paced, tag team-based gameplay style.

&quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; was then released in 1997, which replaced most of the &quot;X-Men&quot; cast with other heroes from the Marvel Universe and introduced the character assist mechanic. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot; later followed in 1998, exchanging the majority of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; cast with characters from other Capcom video games series, such as &quot;Mega Man&quot; and &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;. In 1999, Capcom announced the development of yet another sequel, called &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot;. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; heavily re-used assets from previous Capcom-developed games, including &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, and the earlier &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; titles, resulting in a large roster of 56 playable characters. Shortly after the release of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox ports for &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot;, Capcom lost the use of the Marvel license, putting the series on an indefinite hiatus. However, with the resurgence of 2D fighting games in 2008, owing to the success of &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, Marvel requested Capcom to collaborate with them once again. Capcom would announce the development of the next installment in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot;, in 2010. The game was eventually released in 2011. An updated version of &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;, titled &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;, was released later in the same year. The high-definition compilation game &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Origins&quot; was then released in 2012.

Following the release of &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; for the PlayStation Vita in 2012, Marvel&#x27;s new parent company, The Walt Disney Company, which acquired Marvel in 2009, chose not to renew Capcom&#x27;s license with the Marvel characters, instead opting to put them in its own self-published &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; series. As a result, Capcom had to pull both &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; off their online platforms in 2013. However, in 2016, Disney announced its decision to cancel the &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; series, discontinue self-publishing efforts, and switch to a licensing-only model, allowing them to license their characters to third-party game developers, including Capcom. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; was revealed in 2016, and then released in 2017.

In June 2024, Capcom announced &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics&quot; for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Windows. The compilation features the seven Marvel titles developed and published by Capcom for arcades from &quot;The Punisher&quot; through &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes.&quot; It notably marks the series&#x27; debut on Nintendo platforms, the first time the classic entries have been made available on PC, as well as the first general re-releases for &quot;Marvel Super Heroes, Clash of Super Heroes&quot; and &quot;New Age of Heroes&quot; since the original &quot;Origins&quot; compilation and the remaster of &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; were digitally delisted from seventh generation console storefronts.

==Reception==

The &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series has received reviews ranging from average to positive from critics. According to Capcom President and COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto, the games have enjoyed broad appeal, especially in markets outside of Japan. , units of the series have been sold.

The series&#x27; first three titles, &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, received praise for their frantic gameplay style, visual flair, playable character rosters, and the quality of their sprite animations. The games&#x27; Dreamcast and Sega Saturn ports were also lauded for their technical performance, matching the capabilities of the arcade versions. Conversely, the PlayStation ports were criticized for their removal of tag team battles and noticeable decline in frame rate and animation quality – changes which stemmed from the console&#x27;s RAM limitations.

&quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot; received similar praise, with particular attention given towards the large cast and the addition of three-on-three combat. The Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions were criticized for their lack of online multiplayer support outside Japan. These concerns were addressed with the release of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 ports, which reviewers commended for their smooth online experience. A common source of complaints was the game&#x27;s jazz-inspired soundtrack, which critics deemed as out of place.

In addition to its character variety and visual presentation, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot; garnered praise for simplifying the series&#x27; combat mechanics and control scheme, thus making it more accessible for players new to fighting games. &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; was applauded for its additions to the character roster, gameplay tweaks, and improved online functionality. Both games, however, were criticized for their lack of game modes and single-player content. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Origins&quot; was praised for preserving the original arcade releases&#x27; integrity and its addition of online multiplayer, dynamic challenges, and unlockable content; however, in remaining faithful to the arcade versions, some reviewers criticized the games for their outdated gameplay and unbalanced fighters. &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising its implementation of new gameplay mechanics, such as the &quot;Active Switch&quot; combo system and the addition of the six Infinity Stones. On the other hand, the game was criticized for its presentation, particularly its art direction, and its character roster.

In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; at number 37 on the list of the best video game franchises, commenting that &quot;a frenetic pace and over the top effects work together to make this franchise stand the test of time&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Kolín (Kolin) on 18 June 1757 saw 54,000 Austrians under Count von Daun defeat 34,000 Prussians under Frederick the Great during the Third Silesian War (Seven Years&#x27; War). Prussian attempts to turn the Austrian right flank turned into piecemeal frontal attacks and were defeated in five and a half hours of combat. The Prussians lost 13,733 men, the Austrians 8,100. Frederick gave up the siege of Prague as well as his planned march on Vienna and retreated to Saxony.

==Background==
Frederick II of Prussia had won the bloody battle of Prague against Austria on 6 May 1757 and was besieging the city. Austrian Marshal Daun arrived too late to fight, but picked up 16,000 men who escaped from the battle. With this army he slowly moved to relieve Prague. Frederick stopped the bombardment of Prague and maintained the siege under Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, while the king marched against the Austrians on 13 June along with Prince Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau&#x27;s troops.

Frederick took 34,000 men to intercept Daun. Daun knew that the Prussian forces were too weak to both besiege Prague and keep him away from Prague for a longer time (or to fight the Austrian army reinforced by the Prague garrison), so his Austrian forces took defensive positions on hills near Kolín on the night of 17 June. At noon on 18 June, Frederick attacked the Austrians, who were waiting on the defensive with a force of 35,160 infantry, 18,630 cavalry and 154 guns. The battlefield of Kolín consisted of gently rolling hill slopes.

Frederick&#x27;s plan was to envelop the Austrian right wing with most of his army. Along the Austrian lines (Prussian right wing and center) he kept only enough troops to hide the concentration on the Prussian left wing. The Prussian main force would turn right toward the Austrians to attack their right flank. The Prussian left wing would locally outnumber the Austrians. After the Austrian right wing was defeated the battle would be decided.

==Battle==
Frederick&#x27;s main force turned toward the Austrians too early and attacked their defensive positions frontally instead of outflanking them. Austrian Croatian light infantry (Grenzers) played an important role in this; harassing the regular Prussian infantry under Generals Christopher Hermann von Manstein and Joachim Christian von Tresckow, they provoked them into a premature attack.

Austrian musket and artillery fire stopped Frederick&#x27;s advance. A counterattack by the Austrian right was defeated by Prussian cavalry and Frederick poured more troops into the ensuing gap in the enemy line. This new assault was first halted and then crushed by Austrian cavalry. By afternoon, after about five hours of fighting, the Prussians were disoriented and Daun&#x27;s troops were driving them back. Prussian cuirassiers under Oberst Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz (promoted to major-general on that day) finally showed up. There were many charges and counter-charges on the Křečhoř Hill. The first Guard battalion under General Friedrich Bogislav von Tauentzien saved the Prussian army from a worse fate, covering the Prussian retreat.

==Results==
The battle was Frederick&#x27;s first defeat in this war, and forced him to abandon his intended march on Vienna, raise his siege of Prague on 20 June, and fall back on Litoměřice. The Austrians, reinforced by the 48,000 troops in Prague, followed them, 100,000 strong, and, falling on Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, who was retreating eccentrically (for commissariat reasons) at Zittau, inflicted a severe check upon him. The king retreated from Bohemia to Saxony.

==Reception==
* Following the battle, the Empress Maria Theresa founded the Military Order of Maria Theresa
* The &quot;Kolingasse&quot; in the 9th District of Vienna was named after this victory in 1870.
* Memorials to the battle were erected in Křečhoř and Nová Ves I.

<text>Michael John Durant (born July 23, 1961) is an American veteran, former pilot, businessman, author, and political candidate. He was involved in the &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; incident while serving as a U.S. Army pilot, and ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for the 2022 United States Senate election in Alabama.

Durant was a member of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Night Stalkers) as a Chief Warrant Officer 3. He retired from the U.S. Army as a Chief Warrant Officer 4 Blackhawk helicopter Master Aviator in the 160th SOAR after participating in combat operations Prime Chance, Just Cause, and Desert Storm, and also Gothic Serpent, in which he was held prisoner for 11 days in 1993 after a raid in Somalia.

Following his retirement from the military in 2001, Durant published a book detailing his experiences, was involved in public speaking engagements and founded an engineering company in Huntsville, Alabama. He also became politically active as a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life and military training==
Durant was born on July 23, 1961, in Berlin, New Hampshire, the son of Leon Durant and Louise (nee Boucher). He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1979; after completing basic training, he attended the Defense Language Institute. He was assigned to the 470th Military Intelligence Group at Fort Clayton in Panama as a Spanish voice intercept operator. Durant finished helicopter flight training at Fort Rucker, Alabama. During flight school, he flew the TH-55 trainer and UH-1 helicopters.

==U.S. Army service==
In November 1983, Durant was promoted to Warrant Officer 1, following completion of the UH-60 Black Hawk Aviators Qualification Course, and was assigned to the 377th Medical Evacuation Company in Seoul, South Korea. Durant flew over 150 medical evacuation missions in the UH-1 and UH-60 helicopters by 1985. He later moved to the 101st (Division) Aviation Battalion at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. While serving as a Chief Warrant Officer 2, he took the flight instructor&#x27;s pilot course and conducted air assault missions in the UH-60. Durant joined the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) on August 1, 1988. Assigned to D Company, he performed duties as Flight Lead and Standardization Instructor Pilot. He participated in combat operations Prime Chance, Just Cause and Operation Desert Storm, where he was the first U.S. helicopter pilot to shoot at a SCUD missile launcher.

===&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; incident===
During Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia, Durant was the pilot of helicopter &quot;Super Six Four.” His was the second of two MH-60L Black Hawk helicopters to crash during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. After his helicopter was hit on the tail by an RPG-7, it crashed about a mile southwest of the operation&#x27;s target.

Durant and his crew of three, Bill Cleveland, Ray Frank, and Tommy Field, were badly injured in the crash. Durant suffered a crushed vertebra in his back and a compound fracture of his left femur. Three Delta Force snipers, MSG Gary Gordon, SFC Randy Shughart and MSG Brad Halling had been providing suppressive fire from the air at hostile Somalis who were converging on the crash site. All three volunteered for insertion onto the ground to protect the crew and join Durant in fighting off the advancing Somalis, although Halling took over the Blackhawk&#x27;s minigun after a crew chief was injured before permission was granted and only Gordon and Shugart were inserted. The pair killed numerous Somalis before they ran out of ammunition. They were soon overwhelmed and killed, after Cleveland, Frank and Field had died. Both Gordon and Shughart received the Medal of Honor posthumously for their heroism in this action.

The hostile Somalis captured Durant, the sole American survivor, and held him captive for 11 days. During much of his imprisonment, he was personally protected and cared for by Abdullahi &quot;Firimbi&quot; Hassan, a physician and propaganda minister to Somali General Mohamed Farrah Aidid, though he was shot in his arm by an intruding militia member. Aidid then released Durant and a Nigerian soldier who had been captured previously into the custody of the International Committee of the Red Cross.

After being freed, and recovering at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) in Germany, Durant resumed flying with the 160th SOAR. He retired from the Army in 2001 with more than 3,700 flight hours, over 1,400 of which were flown with night vision goggles.

Durant&#x27;s military service awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star with Valor Device, Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, three Air Medals and the Prisoner of War Medal, among others.

==Business ventures and writing==
After his retirement, Durant moved to Alabama and began offering seminars to military personnel about helicopter maneuvering and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations. Durant talks about the Somalia raid and the experiences he had while in captivity. He spoke extensively with actor Ron Eldard, who portrayed him in the 2001 film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, which depicts the events of the raid.

In 2003, Durant published a book, &quot;In the Company of Heroes&quot;, in which he chronicled his military career and his captivity.

Durant holds a BSc degree in professional aeronautics and an MBA degree in aviation management from the Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University. Following his move to Alabama, he became owner, president and CEO of Pinnacle Solutions, an engineering services company based in Huntsville, Alabama, in 2008. The company&#x27;s clients include the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps and NASA, among others. In December 2021, after the launch of his campaign for the U.S. Senate, Durant turned over control of Pinnacle Solutions to its employees via an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

==Political career==
===Early activities===
Durant became involved in politics after his retirement from the military; as a Republican, he served on the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008, both times in a veterans&#x27; leadership role.

In July 2008, Durant criticized then-presidential candidate Barack Obama for having cancelled a planned trip to LRMC near Ramstein Air Base where he had intended, while in Europe, to visit American casualties of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Durant said he thought this was inappropriate for a potential commander in chief. Scott Gration, a retired two-star Air Force general who advised the Obama campaign, said in a response that Obama &quot;did not want to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go.&quot;

In 2011, Durant gave a speech to the U.S. Army War College, during which he mentioned the opinion that &quot;disarming the population,&quot; like what had been done in Somalia, would be &quot;a pretty good step toward law and order&quot; in U.S. cities. The comments re-emerged during Durant&#x27;s campaign for the U.S. Senate; the campaign of primary opponent Katie Britt charged that Durant&#x27;s worldview was &quot;not conservative.&quot; Durant claimed that media outlets had mischaracterized and taken his statements out of context. In an interview with radio host Phil Williams, Durant stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not condoning it. In fact, I&#x27;m arguing against it, that it really isn&#x27;t a smart tactic – certainly not when you&#x27;re outnumbered like we were there.&quot;

===2022 U.S. Senate candidacy===
In September 2021, media speculation arose regarding a possible run for U.S. Senate by Durant. He officially launched a campaign for the office on October 19, 2021, running to replace retiring incumbent senator Richard Shelby in 2022. A late entry to the race, Durant positioned himself as a political outsider and supporter of former president Donald Trump, outlining an &quot;Alabama First&quot; campaign tour. Durant was supported by the More Perfect Union political action committee, which supports the formation of a caucus of centrist senators.

By March 2022, Durant began to lead in polls against the two major opposing candidates in the Republican primary, Shelby&#x27;s former Chief of Staff Katie Britt and Representative Mo Brooks. Durant&#x27;s lead expanded after Brooks was un-endorsed by Trump. That same month, Durant expressed in interviews that he believed President Joe Biden was &quot;not rightfully elected&quot; in the 2020 presidential election and that he would not have voted to certify the election results, as well as support for removing Biden from office.

In April 2022, the Alabama Republican Party proposed a series of televised debates between Durant, Britt and Brooks. Durant&#x27;s campaign did not agree to participate in these debates, and declined to comment when asked about the debates. Britt, Brooks, and other political analysts such as Quin Hillyer and Steve Flowers criticized Durant for an apparent refusal to debate. Brooks said that Durant &quot;has the public policy chops of a snail,&quot; while Britt questioned if Durant had &quot;something to hide.&quot; Alabama Republican Party chair John Wahl stated that the debates were unlikely to occur without Durant&#x27;s participation. Durant broke the silence on the debates on April 21, 2022, stating that he was open to debating but also cited scheduling issues with his own campaign schedule. Durant then officially declined the proposed dates for the debates later that month, shuttering the plans for the debate series.

Durant began to slip in polls around May, in the weeks before the primary election. Durant was the subject of multiple negative attack ads that contributed to a rising unfavorable rating among voters in polls. Additionally, Durant was the subject of speculation that he did not actually live in Alabama, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a false claim.&quot; Durant&#x27;s views on immigration also attracted attention shortly before the primary; he claimed in a radio interview that increased legal immigration was &quot;America First&quot; while also touting that he was &quot;the toughest on illegal immigration.&quot; On the night of the primary on May 24, Durant conceded the election after incoming results showed him in third place behind Britt and Brooks. Although there was media speculation that Durant would endorse Brooks after losing a spot in the runoff, in June, Durant officially declined to endorse Brooks or Britt, lambasting the political process and the two remaining candidates. Durant also stated that his campaign would be his last foray into politics, blaming his loss on &quot;blatant&quot; untrue attack ads.

==Personal life==
Durant and his wife, Lisa (who is also a former Army aviator), reside in Madison, Alabama. They have six children and three grandchildren. Durant&#x27;s previous marriage to his first wife, Lorrie, ended in divorce; Durant later stated that his handling of the media attention he received in the wake of the &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; incident &quot;probably was a contributing factor&quot; to the divorce.

<text>The Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf (30 August 1757) was a victory for the Russian force under Field Marshal Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin over a smaller Prussian force commanded by Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt, during the Seven Years&#x27; War. This was the first battle in which Russia engaged during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

Despite the tactical success, supply problems made a successful advance further into East Prussia impractical. Apraksin decided not to take Königsberg and ordered a withdrawal soon after the battle. Suspecting collusion between Apraksin and Chancellor Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, who had opposed the invasion, Elizabeth of Russia removed Apraksin from command, ordered Bestuzhev-Ryumin to face trial for treason, and appointed William Fermor as the head of the army. Femor led the army back into East Prussia in the following year.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Although the Seven Years&#x27; War was a global conflict, it took a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, the prosperous province of Silesia. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Silesian province. In 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in North America offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Seeing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia&#x27;s growing power, Austria put aside the old rivalry with France to form a new coalition. Faced with this turn of events, Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king&#x27;s territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his relatives in the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

At the outset of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, the course of the war had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had achieved spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen back to Austria. The Prussians then pressed south into Austrian Moravia. In April 1758, Prussia and Britain concluded the Anglo-Prussian Convention in which the British committed to pay Frederick an annual subsidy of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 7,000–9,000 troops to reinforce Frederick&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel&#x27;s army. Ferdinand evicted the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758; he crossed the Rhine, causing general alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand&#x27;s victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of Düsseldorf, successful manoeuvres of the larger French forces required him to withdraw across the Rhine.

While Ferdinand and the British allies kept the French busy in the Rhineland, Prussia had to contend with Sweden, Russia, and Austria. There remained a possibility that Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. In particular, East Prussia was cut off from the rest of Prussia by of Polish territory, and seemed an easy target, but some Russian court officials—notably Chancellor Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin—opposed Russia&#x27;s entry into what seemed like a largely western European dispute. Bestuzhev-Ryumin did not trust the Prussians, but also had little liking for the French or the British. In this conflict, which grew out of the major realignment of European power diplomacy, it was difficult to determine if the enemy of an enemy was a friend.

==Dispositions==
The Russian field marshal Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin commanded an army of approximately 55,000 men and crossed the Niemen. They captured Memel, which became the army&#x27;s base for an invasion of the rest of Prussia. Apraxin was cautious, however, and inexperienced in wartime measures. Instead of marching on Wehlau, as was expected, he ordered his forces to cross the Pregel River in safety, near the village of Gross-Jägersdorf. The position in East Prussia had stretched the Russian supply lines, and the troops were forced to forage. Foraging quickly degenerated into unruliness and turned into a scorched earth policy, a process that Frederick derided, thinking the Russians undisciplined troops; a disciplined army, the King reasoned, would make quick work of them. They moved on Königsberg, to try to take or at least invest the city.
Frederick sent his 70-year-old Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt, who commanded of forces in East Prussia, with 28,000 men; he supplied Lehwaldt with one hundred officers&#x27; patents to fill as he saw fit, expecting him to strengthen the army there. He also sent ambiguous orders to take on the Russians whenever his field marshal saw fit. Frederick had not given him specific instructions, just general ones to act when the moment seemed propitious.

== Battle ==

The Russians started the day with a leisurely march, but the army was undisciplined and difficult to move in any concentrated, organized way. Seeing the opportunity, the Prussians attacked the milling and &quot;unprepared mob&quot; of Russian soldiers. Lehwaldt&#x27;s cavalry attacked the northern and southern flanks of the Russian army, inflicting initial heavy losses. The Russians, entirely unprepared for an assault by an army half its size, degenerated into further confusion. Apraxin&#x27;s inexperienced commanders tried to organize the infantry; General Pyotr Rumyantsev, who later became one of Russia&#x27;s best generals, managed to rally the Russians in the center, as it recovered from the shock of the initial attack. General Vasily Lopukhin was bayoneted by the Prussians: some reports say he died in the arms of his comrades, others, that he died a few days later.

Initially, Lehwaldt&#x27;s force retained some advantage in the battle. The fierce Prussian assault prevented the Russians from forming the traditional squares with which to repel cavalry, but they did not break and run. Furthermore, observers reported that the main force of Prussians advancing on the center fired volley upon volley with their usual ruthless efficiency. The Russian army recovered from the shock of the initial assault and counter-attacked. Initially mesmerized by the Prussian onslaught, the Russians recovered to shoot back; their return fire was not of the same efficiency, but it was nevertheless effective and the Prussian line eventually collapsed under it. Furthermore, the Kalmyk cavalry and the Don Cossacks, on the Prussian left, pretended to retreat so as to trap the attacking Prussians under heavy artillery fire. This was an effort by Apraksin to encircle the Prussians with his larger army, which Lehwaldt was able to avoid.

Lehwaldt&#x27;s force retired to its former camp and held its ground there.

== Aftermath ==
The Prussians achieved a surprise attack, seized a number of positions from numerically superior forces and inflicted equivalent losses. As at Zorndorf, they proved to be effective against stronger forces in close-quarter fighting. On the other hand, the Russians, as a Saxon officer remarked, &quot;had neither time nor opportunity to form a square, and yet they did extremely well&quot;, despite being taken completely by surprise. Lehwaldt lost between 4,600 and 5,000 casualties and Apraxin, approximately 5,400. Some sources estimate Russian losses as higher: perhaps half again as many casualties, so in the 7,000 range.

Although Lehwaldt withdrew his corps from the battle, and subsequently oversaw the Blockade of Stralsund. The Russian success at Gross-Jägersdorf also encouraged Sweden to join the fight against Prussia.

=== Impact on Russian Army ===
In the aftermath, it was popularly expected in Russia that Apraksin would pursue the Prussian retreat and eventually overrun all of East Prussia; he was, after all, only away from the Königsberg. Inexplicably, the general stopped his advance towards Königsberg and withdrew back into Russia. Historians offer several reasons: after hearing a false report that Empress Elizabeth of Russia had died; to support Peter III as heir to the throne; Apraxin marched on Königsberg but his troops, lacking in supplies, suffered considerable attrition; and, finally, an epidemic of smallpox, which hit the Russian army, especially the Kalmyks, and resulted in 8.5 times more deaths than all the battles fought in 1757.

Recent research suggests that the Russians were entirely unprepared for war beyond their western border and had not realistically evaluated their potential supply problems in East Prussia. Apraxin, at best a modest commander, had assessed supplies in the region and believed they were sufficient; he had not established specifically Russian supply depots in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was neutral, but intended to rely on local supply. In 1757, the ongoing support of the 92,000 horses alone required more fodder than was available from any of the friendly territories in Livland, much less unfriendly East Prussia. Furthermore, the Russians had made no effort to expand their supply depots using the Baltic&#x27;s seaports, which would have been the most obvious way to feed that number of troops at that distance. Finally, the efforts at the troops to requisition supplies were met by a localized guerilla uprising; farmers burnt their crops and destroyed their supplies rather than give to the Russians. Once the Russians reached Livland, observers noted exhausted troops hauling carts because their horses, living on a diet of oak leaves, dropped dead by the hundreds every day.

The Empress was so angry with Apraxin that she removed him from command, and launched an investigation into his actions. She put Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, her chancellor and a friend of Apraxin, on trial for treason. Bestuzhev-Ryumin was later exiled to his estates. Elizabeth appointed William Fermor as the new Russian commander and the next year the invasion was started again. Fermor had an entirely different attitude towards supplying his troops, and developed an extensive network of local supply depots and sources outside of the Russian boundary. This, though, attracted aspersions from his political enemies in St. Petersburg, who claimed he was wasting the imperial treasury; however, Fermor was considerably more successful in 1758 than his predecessor had been in 1757.

<text>The Battle of Moys was fought on 7 September 1757 during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War). 
A Prussian army of 13,000 men fought an Austrian army of double their size. The Prussians were defeated and their commander killed.

The battle was fought near Moys in Upper Lusatia, present-day Ujazd, a district of Zgorzelec in Poland.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Although the Seven Years&#x27; War was a global conflict, it acquired a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1741–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle concluded the earlier war with Austria. Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, acquired the prosperous province of Silesia. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she intended to regain ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire. In 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in North America offered the Empress the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia&#x27;s ever growing power. Similarly, France sought to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. France and Austria put aside their old rivalry to form a coalition of their own. Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king&#x27;s territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his relatives in the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

After over-running Saxony, Frederick campaigned in Bohemia and defeated the Austrians on 6 May 1757 at the Battle of Prague; however he was defeated at the Battle of Kolín on the 18th of June and was eventually forced to retreat fully out of Bohemia. With French forces threatening his western flank, Frederick moved to engage them, leaving some 40,000 soldiers to defend Silesia and Lusatia from the Austrians under the command of Augustus William of Brunswick Bevern.

Bevern&#x27;s duty was to block any Austrian advance on Saxony; he also left Hans Karl von Winterfeldt to &quot;assist&quot; him. Frederick actually trusted Winterfeldt more, as the duke was ageing, however the two did not get along. Bevern felt embarrassed; Winterfeldt felt irked by the constraints imposed.

Bevern became alarmed by the lack of his supplies, and withdrew to Görlitz, leaving Winterfeldt&#x27;s corps on the opposite side of the Lusatian Neisse river, near Moys.

On the day before the battle, Prince Charles sent Franz Leopold von Nádasdy to the right bank of the river, nearly on Moys, with instructions to take Jäkelsberg (a hill) on the following day. He has 15,000 men, possibly 20,000, and artillery.

==Battle==
On 7 September, Winterfeldt was absent from his corps, either in consultation with Bevern, or having escorted a meal convoy out of Bautzen: sources disagree. The Austrians launched an attack on the Jäkelsberg but their first assault was repulsed. They then launched a larger attack across the full Prussian line. Winterfeldt quickly arrived with some reinforcements but was soon killed in the fighting. The Austrians managed to take the Jäkelsberg, threatening other Prussian positions and forcing the full Prussian corps to retreat towards Görlitz. During the battle Bevern had ample time to reinforce Winterfeldt but he failed to do so.

==Aftermath==

Following the battle, the Austrians would advance into Silesia, defeating Bevern at the Battle of Breslau in November.

On 5 November 1757, Frederick defeated the combined French and Austrian force at the Battle of Rossbach. He soon learned that in his absence, the Austrians had managed to take Silesia. Frederick would go on to engage the Austrians at the Battle of Leuthen, in which he won a decisive victory

<text>The Battle of Breslau (also known as the &quot;Battle on the Lohe&quot;) was fought on 22 November 1757 in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War). A Prussian army of 28,000 men fought an Austrian army of 60,000 men. The Prussians held off the Austrian attack, losing 6,000 men to the Austrians&#x27; 5,000 men. But one day later the Prussians beat a retreat. Breslau&#x27;s garrison surrendered on 25 November 1757.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Although the Seven Years&#x27; War was a global conflict, it acquired a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1741–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle concluded the earlier war with Austria. Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, acquired the prosperous province of Silesia. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she intended to regain ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire. In 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in North America offered the Empress the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia&#x27;s ever growing power. Similarly, France sought to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. France and Austria put aside their old rivalry to form a coalition of their own. Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king&#x27;s territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his relatives in the Electorate of Hanover and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

After over-running Saxony, Frederick campaigned in Bohemia and defeated the Austrians on 6 May 1757 at the Battle of Prague. Learning that French forces had invaded his ally&#x27;s territory of Hanover, Frederick moved west. On 5 November 1757, he defeated the combined French and Austrian force at the Battle of Rossbach. In his absence, the Austrians had managed to retake Silesia: Prince Charles had taken the city of Schweidnitz and moved on Breslau in Lower Silesia.

===Background===

The duke of Brunswick-Bevern was supposed to cover Silesia with a force of 32,000 troops. This soon turned out to be a difficult task as he had to face the superior Austrian forces, whose main army of 54,000 troops was led by Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine and Count Leopold Joseph von Daun. The corps of 28,000 troops under Franz Leopold von Nádasdy was also able to advance to the front. Despite their overwhelming superiority, the Austrians wanted to initially avoid a battle.

After Nádasdy&#x27;s corps had been reinforced bringing its strength up to 43,000 troops, the Austrians surrounded Schweidnitz on 14 October. The handover then took place on 13 November. Until then, Bevern had managed to keep the main Austrian army engaged in battle. However, after joining Nádasdy&#x27;s corps it had been considerably strengthened.

As a direct result of the additional reinforcements, the Austrian army command gave up their position and decided to launch an immediate attack on the Prussians; their intention was to take Breslau before the arrival of the main Prussian forces so that they would be unable to winter in Silesia.

The Prussians had over 40 battalions and 102 squadrons at their disposal (totaling 28,400 troops). The Austrian army, however, consisted of 96 battalions, 93 grenadier companies, 141 squadrons and 228 artillery pieces (totaling 83.606 troops).

==Course of battle==

Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine attacked the Prussian forces on 22 November outside the gates of Breslau, between the villages of Kosel und Gräbschen, launching the battle with a cannonade. The Prussians, who had taken up fortified positions in the surrounding villages, were then attacked at three separate points. After the Austrians were able to conquer the first few villages, they manned them with howitzers and intensified their cannonade, after which the duke of Brunswick-Bevern gathered ten regiments together and began a counter-attack. A tough, bloody struggle for the villages began, in which the Prussians were able to score several decisive successes against the superior Austrian forces. It has never been established whether Bevern wanted to lead another counter-attack the next day or retreat. Nevertheless, the Prussians did retreat, which seemed to have begun suddenly as if on cue, whether it had been ordered or not. The battle field was consequently abandoned to Prince Charles and the Prussians went back to Glogau via Breslau.

The battle, which had lasted almost the entire day, cost the Austrians 5,723 men and the Prussians 6,350 men.

==Results==

Following the withdrawal of the Prussian army, 10 battalions under General Johann Georg von Lestwitz remained behind in the fortress of Breslau. The Austrians immediately laid siege under the direction of General Nádasdy. The Austrian-minded population of Breslau made the Prussians&#x27; defense difficult as not only did Breslau&#x27;s citizens pressure Lestwitz to vacate the fortress but they also aided any Prussian deserters.

Prussian morale was extremely low due to their defeat on the battlefield and the high proportion of conscripts serving in the army. Discipline almost collapsed. Lestwitz surrendered on the night of 25 November on condition of being allowed to withdraw unhindered. Out of the 4,227 Prussian soldiers, only 599 of them began the march to Glogau; the rest deserted.

Frederick had been marching west to help his British allies defend Hanover. Due to these events, Frederick was forced to completely change his campaign plans. Before reversing his course, though, he soundly defeated an allied force of French and Austrian troops at the Battle of Rossbach. After the battle, he reversed his course and in 12 days covered the to Leuthen. There, on 4 December, he executed a brilliantly conceived plan of maneuver and subterfuge, fooling both Prince Charles and Daun. Following his decisive win at Leuthen, most of the Austrians defending the city decamped, although they left behind a garrison of 17,000 plus stores and ammunition, commanded by Soloman Sprecher von Bernegg. After a brief but brutal siege, Frederick forced the capitulation in late December 1757.

<text>The Battle of Leuthen was fought on 5 December 1757 between Frederick the Great&#x27;s Prussian Army and an Austrian army commanded by Prince Charles of Lorraine and Count Leopold Joseph von Daun. Frederick used maneuver warfare and knowledge of the terrain to rout the larger Austrian force completely. The victory ensured Prussian control of Silesia during the Third Silesian War, which was part of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

The battle was fought in and around the town of Leuthen (now Lutynia, Poland), 10 km (6 mi) northwest of Breslau, (now Wrocław, Poland), in Prussian (formerly Austrian) Silesia. By exploiting the training of his troops and his superior knowledge of the terrain, Frederick created a diversion at one end of the battlefield and moved most of his smaller army behind a series of low hillocks. The surprise attack in oblique order on the unsuspecting Austrian flank baffled Prince Charles, who took several hours to realize that the main action was to his left, not his right. Within seven hours, the Prussians had destroyed the Austrians and erased any advantage that the Austrians had gained throughout the campaigning in the preceding summer and autumn. Within 48 hours, Frederick had laid siege to Breslau, which resulted in the city&#x27;s surrender on 19–20 December.

Leuthen was the last battle at which Prince Charles commanded the Austrian Army before his sister-in-law, Empress Maria Theresa, appointed him as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and placed Leopold Joseph von Daun in command of the army. The battle also established beyond doubt Frederick&#x27;s military reputation in European circles and was arguably his greatest tactical victory. After the Battle of Rossbach on 5 November, the French had refused to participate further in Austria&#x27;s war with Prussia, and after Leuthen (5 December), Austria could not continue the war by itself.

==Background==

Although the Seven Years&#x27; War was a global conflict, it acquired a specific intensity in the European theater as a result of the competition between Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, and Maria Theresa of Austria. Their rivalry dated from 1740, when upon Maria Theresa&#x27;s ascension, Frederick had attacked and annexed the prosperous province of Silesia. The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) between Prussia and Maria Theresa&#x27;s allies, awarded Silesia to Prussia. Maria Theresa had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances and intended to regain her ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire and to reacquire Silesia. Similarly, France sought to break the British dominance of the Atlantic trade.

In 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in North America offered the Empress the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia&#x27;s ever-growing power. France and Austria put aside their old rivalry to form a coalition of their own; Maria Theresa agreed that one of her daughters, Maria Antonia, would marry the Dauphin of France, and her chief ministers negotiated a military and political pact advantageous to both parties. That drove Britain to align herself with George II&#x27;s nephew, Frederick II. Their alliance also involved the Electorate of Hanover, which was held in personal union by George, along with George&#x27;s and Frederick&#x27;s relatives, who ruled the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. That series of political manoeuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

When war broke out in 1756, Frederick overran Saxony and campaigned in Bohemia, where he defeated the Austrians on 6 May 1757 at the Battle of Prague. Learning that the French forces had invaded his ally&#x27;s territory of Hanover, Frederick moved west. On 5 November 1757, an infantry regiment of about 1,000 men and 1,500 of his cavalry defeated the combined French and Austrian force of 30,000 at the Battle of Rossbach in a 90-minute battle. In his absence, however, the Austrians had managed to retake Silesia: the Empress&#x27;s brother-in-law, Prince Charles, took the city of Schweidnitz and moved on Breslau in lower Silesia.

Heading back to Silesia, Frederick learned of the fall of Breslau in late November. He and his 22,000 men covered in 12 days and, at Liegnitz, joined up with the Prussian troops who had survived the fighting at Breslau. The augmented army of about 33,000 troops, with approximately 167 cannons, arrived near Leuthen to find 66,000 Austrians in possession.

==Terrain and troop strengths==

Most of Lower Silesia is a rolling plain of fertile land. It includes black and alluvial soils near Breslau (Wrocław) and in river valleys, mixed with more sandy soils. Between the Oder river and the foot of the Sudeten Mountains, it has mild climate, fertile soils and extensive water network, which made it a coveted agricultural resource.

In the area northwest of Breslau, the absence of steep hills makes the observation of an approaching enemy easy, and the relative flatness limited hiding manoeuvers. The presence of alluvial soil guaranteed relatively-soft ground, less than what Frederick would face at Kunersdorf in 1758 but enough to provide the occasional natural bogs to bar the passage of troops in some locations or to muffle the sound of marching and horses&#x27; hooves. The area around Leuthen included several hamlets and villages: principally, Nypern, about north; Frobelwitz, also to the north, about halfway between Leuthen and Nypern; Gohlau, to the southeast; and Lissa (now a district of Wrocław), to the east. A road connected the villages of Borne, Leuthen, and Lissa with Breslau, across the Oder River and its tributaries.

===Habsburgs===

Aware of Frederick&#x27;s approach, Charles and his second-in-command, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, positioned the army facing west on a front in country of undulating plains. The Prince deployed his troops in two lines, the right wing at his northernmost point, anchored at Nypern. Leuthen served as the Austrian centre. Charles established his command post there by using a church tower as his observation post and stationing seven battalions in the village itself. The majority of Charles&#x27; forces stood on his right wing. A small advanced post stood at Borne, but with Frederick&#x27;s arrival in force, it withdrew immediately to the east. The Austrian position intersected at right angles with the principal road between Borne and Breslau and passed through Frobelwitz and Lissa. He secured Nypern with eight grenadier companies and placed his cavalry at Guckerwitz (now Kokorzyce, part of the village Krępice). The Austrian line extended as far south as Sagschütz (now Zakrzyce), where his cavalry stood at right angles to the infantry and created a line between Sagschütz and Gohlau. The positions were secured with additional grenadiers and pickets. Troops filled villages and woods, and hastily made abatis and redoubts. Pickets guarded all communication points as well as road and path crossings. The left wing was his shortest, with cavalry placed at the far end, near a stream by the village of Gohlau. Charles had an amalgamated force of Habsburg troops, including several contingents from the Military Frontier and imperial troops from the Duchies of Württemberg and Bavaria.

===Prussia===
Frederick had learned the countryside by heart on previous maneuvers. On 4 December 1757, from his position on the Schönberg, a knoll about west of Borne, he surveyed the familiar landscape with his generals, and a plan emerged. In front of him, a cluster of low hills dotted the landscape along an axis approximately parallel to the Austrian line. He knew the names of the hills: Schleierberg, Sophienberg, Wachberg and Butterberg. They were hardly hills, more like hillocks, but were high enough to provide a screen for his troops. Facing an army twice his size, he had to rely on his own army&#x27;s tactical training and to use the terrain to maneuver his men into an optimal position. Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: any company of his troops fired at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire a phenomenal five, which was twice the rate of fire of most other European armies. Only the Russians could come close to achieving that rate. The Prussians could maneuver better than any of the armies in Europe and could march faster, and they had just come from a resounding success at Rossbach. His artillery could quickly deploy and redeploy to support his infantry. His cavalry, superbly trained, could maneuver and charge with horses flank to flank and riders knee to knee and move at a full gallop.

==Battle==
===Prussian feint===
The foggy weather made it difficult to see positions from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and a cluster of infantry in front of the northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder, the bulk of his forces toward Leuthen itself. Charles saw them start their redeployment and may have interpreted the maneuver as withdrawal at least for a while.

At 4:00 a.m. on Sunday, Frederick moved toward the Austrian right wing in four columns, with infantry in the inner two and cavalry in the outer two. Using the knolls to block the Austrians&#x27; view of his movements, Frederick shifted the two columns of infantry and one of cavalry obliquely to his own right. The leftmost column of cavalry remained behind to convince the Austrians that it was still approaching directly at the latter end of the Austrian line, near Frobelwitz. The visible distraction screened Frederick&#x27;s intent of executing an oblique maneuver like the one that he had used successfully only weeks earlier at the Battle of Rossbach. Prince Charles, watching from his vantage point, moved his entire reserve to his right flank. That not only weakened the left flank but also stretched his front from Leuthen past Frobelwitz and on to Nypern and extended it well beyond its original .

While a single column of cavalry mesmerised Charles at his rightmost flank, the rest of the Prussians continued undetected, behind those hills across the Austrian front and overreached the Austrian left wing.

===Oblique maneuver===

The Prussian infantry marched southward and remained behind a line of low hills, out of the Austrians&#x27; sight. When the heads of both superbly-drilled Prussian columns, the distances between the marching platoons remaining exactly the width of each platoon&#x27;s front, had passed the Austrian left flank, the columns veered left toward the enemy and continued their march until they had passed beyond the left Austrian flank. On command, the platoons of the columns then faced left at Lobetinz, and the whole Prussian army stood in line of battle, two to three men deep, at a nearly-right angle to the weakest point of the Austrian left. Similarly, Hans Joachim von Zieten&#x27;s cavalry had traversed the entire Austrian front and positioned itself at a 45-degree angle to the Austrian flank.

The Prussian artillery perched on the reverse slopes of the Butterberg and was hidden from the Austrians&#x27; view while it prepared to move to the crest to time their bombardment with the infantry&#x27;s attack. The bulk of the repositioned Prussian army now faced the smallest component of the Austrian line. The only column of Prussian cavalry and the small reserve of infantry remaining at the Austrian far right continued to demonstrate in front of the Austrians and even moved further north, as if an attack would occur there.

=== Attack ===
The Austrians were astonished at the Prussian appearance on their left flank, but the objective was soon clear. The Prussian infantry, now arrayed in the conventional two lines of battle, advanced on the weakest part of the Austrian line with the intention of rolling up the flank. The Austrian colonels on the scene did their best by turning their own lines 90 degrees and trying to take advantage of a shallow ditch, which faced the Prussian line. Franz Leopold von Nádasdy, who commanded the flank, asked Charles for support, a request that was ignored. Even in the late morning, with most of the Prussian army on his left flank, he still believed that any attack would come at the northern flank. Most of the men in the first Austrian line were Württembergers, Protestant troops whose willingness to fight the Lutheran Prussians had been called into question by the Austrian command. The Württembergers held out and maintained steady musket fire until the mass of Prussians emerged through the haze of gunpowder. They then ran for their lives, sweeping the Bavarians deployed by Nádasdy to support his flank with them.

The first wave of Prussian infantry, supported by Frederick&#x27;s artillery, which now pounded away from the crest of one of the hillocks, pushed steadily toward Leuthen. Commanded by Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau, the seasoned infantry and grenadiers went into battle with 60 rounds per man, according to Prussian regulation. When they overwhelmed the first Austrian line, they had already run out of ammunition. Nádasdy sent his own small cavalry against the Prussian grenadier column and its infantry support but to no avail. Nádasdy withdrew his men in chaos with his troops disarrayed. Prince Charles and Daun finally realised they had been tricked and rushed troops from the right to the left, but they had extended the front, which was originally about long, to almost , when they had repositioned forces earlier that day to meet Frederick&#x27;s diversion. As the Austrians withdrew, the Prussian artillery raked them with enfilade fire.
The Prussian infantry and grenadiers reached Leuthen in 40 minutes and pushed the Austrian troops into the village. Prussian grenadiers breached the wall first and stormed the church, where many of the defenders were killed. Hand-to-hand fighting raged throughout the village. Charles-Joseph Lamoral, eventually Prince de Ligne, was then a captain in an Austrian regiment of foot:
Our Lieutenant-Colonel fell[,] killed almost at the first; beyond this we lost our Major, and indeed all the Officers but three... We had crossed two successive ditches, which lay in an orchard to the left of the first houses in Leuthen; and were beginning to form in front of the village. But there was no standing of it. Besides a general cannonade such as can hardly be imagined, there was a rain of case-shot upon this Battalion, of which I, as there was no Colonel left, had to take command.
Leuthen was not a big village, troops were so closely packed they stood 30 to 100 ranks deep and the killing was terrible. Lamoral commented later that his battalion, usually some 1,000 strong, as well as some Hungarians and some grenadiers who had been separated from their own companies, gave him fewer than 200 men. He drew them back to the height at the edge of the village, where there was a windmill around which they could take shelter. Eventually, the Prussian Life Guards, commanded by Captain Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf broke through the village cemetery and forced them to abandon their post.

The Austrians briefly took the advantage when they moved a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry, and the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy at right angles to their original front. Frederick responded by ordering the last of his reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick&#x27;s heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. Some participants said that barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, won the battle.

The assault on the wall briefly exposed General Wolf Frederick von Retzow&#x27;s infantry line. More than two hours had elapsed since the Prince had ordered his cavalry back to Leuthen, but it arrived opportunely. Commanded by Joseph Count Lucchesi d’ Averna the cavalry hurried to take them in the flank; a successful cavalry charge at that critical moment could have turned the tide of battle. Unfortunately for the Austrians, 40 squadrons of Zieten&#x27;s cavalry awaited them at Radaxdorf and charged their flank, and another 30 squadrons commanded by Georg Wilhelm von Driesen charged their front. The Bayreuth Dragoons hit the other flank; and the Puttkamer Hussars charged the rear. Lucchessi was killed by being decapitated by a cannonball, and his troopers were scattered. The cavalry mêlée soon swirled into the Austrian infantry line behind Leuthen, which caused more confusion. Overrun by the Prussian horse, the Austrian infantry broke. The infantry and then the cavalry retreated toward Breslau, where they crossed the Schweidnitzer Weistritz river, then called the &quot;Black Water&quot;.

== Aftermath ==

As the smoke cleared, the Prussian infantry reformed its lines and prepared to pursue the fleeing Austrians. Snow began to fall, and Frederick halted the pursuit. A few soldiers, perhaps only one of them, started to sing the well-known chorale &quot;Nun danket alle Gott&quot; (&quot;Now Thank We All Our God&quot;). Eventually the entire army may have joined in the song, but that story is likely apocryphal.

Frederick pushed toward Lissa. Refugees from the battle had filled the town, and he found the courtyard of the local castle crowded with startled Austrian officers. Reportedly, after the King dismounted, he addressed them politely, &quot;Good evening, Gentlemen, I dare say you did not expect me here. Can one get a night&#x27;s lodging along with you?&quot;

After a day of rest, on 7 December, Frederick sent half his cavalry with Zieten, chasing Charles&#x27;s retreating army, now heading toward Königgrätz by Schweidnitz and captured another 2,000 men and their baggage. With the rest of his army, Frederick marched on Breslau. By chasing Charles&#x27;s army into Bohemia, the Prussians guaranteed the isolation of the Allied garrison holding Breslau. The Austrian general left in command of the city, Lieutenant Field Marshal Salman Sprecher von Bernegg, had a combined force of French and Austrian of 17,000 men. Breslau was a well-fortified city of walls and moats. The Austrians were determined to hold Breslau not only because losing it would cost them control of Silesia and considerable diminution of prestige but also because of the immense quantities of stores that the city held. The Austrian commander, recognizing his grim plight, posted placards on gallows and poles throughout the city and warned that anyone who spoke of surrender would be hanged immediately. On 7 December, Frederick laid siege to the city, and the future of Austrian control of Breslau and the region looked grim. Indeed, Breslau surrendered on 19–20 December.

===Casualties===
Out of an army of approximately 66,000 men, the Austrians lost 22,000, including 3,000 dead, 7,000 wounded and an astonishing 12,000 captured. Of the dead and wounded, the Austrian demographer and historian Gaston Bodart estimated that almost 5% were officers. He also placed such other losses as capture and desertion at 17,000, almost 26%. Charles lost entire regiments, which scattered in the first attacks or overrun at the end; they simply dissolved in the waves of Prussian blue coats. The Prussians also captured 51 standards and 116 of the 250 Austrian cannons. Of the Prussian army of 36,000, Frederick lost 6,344, including 1,141 dead, 5,118 wounded and 85 captured. He lost none of his artillery.

Despite the victory, its cost was high: Frederick lost one fifth of the men he had taken into battle, including two of his major generals.

The battle presented a severe blow to Austrian morale. The army had been soundly beaten by another half its size with fewer guns and tired after a long march over twelve days. Charles and his second-in-command, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, sank &quot;in the depths of despondency&quot;, and the prince could not fathom what had happened. Charles had a mixed-to-poor record against Frederick in past encounters, but he had never fared so badly as at Leuthen. After the crushing defeat, Maria Theresa replaced him with Daun. Charles retired from military service and later served as the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands.

The Austrians also learned some lessons, such as not to fight the Prussians in open fields and to choose their own ground for battle. They later used those lessons.

==Assessments==
Frederick had benefited from an obliging enemy. Firstly, Charles saw what he wanted to see regarding the principal attack, instead of using his efficient light cavalry to scout the Prussian movements. Frederick commented later that a lone patrol could have uncovered his plan. The cavalry that Frederick had left demonstrating in front of the northernmost position of the Austrian line was simply a diversion to hide his real movements. Secondly, the Austrians obliged him by their failure to post pickets on their unprotected flank south of Leuthen. Nádasdy&#x27;s omission of outposts on his open flank south of Leuthen was a surprising oversight for an officer with his long years of experience against the Prussians. He should have considered the possibility of an attack from an unexpected place because that was Frederick&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot;. Thirdly, even when confronted with the attack on his left, the diversion on the right flank near Frobelwitz continued to mesmerize Charles. When he ordered cavalry to move from the north to support the faltering troops in and around Leuthen in the south, they had too far to travel in too little time.

The battle was Frederick&#x27;s greatest victory so far, perhaps the greatest use of tactics in his career, and showed the superiority of Prussian infantry. In one day, Frederick had regained every advantage the Austrians had won earlier that year at Breslau and Schweidnitz and ended the Austrian attempt to reclaim Silesia. The battle became an on the use of 18th-century linear tactics. Frederick had learned valuable lessons at Battles of Prague and Kolin in which his infantry had run out of ammunition and lost the initiative. At Leuthen, ammunition wagons moved with the advancing lines of grenadiers and infantry battalions, which allowed the troops to be resupplied quickly without losing momentum. Although some infantrymen fired as many as 180 rounds, the advance never halted for lack of ammunition. The Prussian cavalry successfully protected the infantry&#x27;s flanks, most notably during Nádasdy&#x27;s assault on the Prussian grenadiers at Leuthen&#x27;s church. The cavalry also provided tactically important charges, disrupting Austrian attempts to reform, which eventually turned the defeat into a rout. Frederick&#x27;s horse artillery, which was sometimes called the flying artillery for its ability to move rapidly, maintained its fire and kept pace with the army and deployed and redeployed its guns as needed. In addition to the physical damage they wrought, the distinctive sound of the horse artillery&#x27;s 12-pounder cannon, sometimes called &quot;Brummers&quot;, heightened Prussian morale and reduced that of the Austrians.

The victory changed the attitude of Frederick&#x27;s enemies. Before the battle, he was often referred to in an unflattering, even demeaning, manner, but after Leuthen, he was widely called the King of Prussia in both polite and popular conversation. The victories at Leuthen and Rossbach earned Frederick respect and fear, which even his bitter enemies held for the rest of the war and the subsequent peace. Both battles probably saved Prussia from conquest by Austria. Half-a-century later, Napoleon called Leuthen &quot;a masterpiece of movements, maneuvers and resolution&quot;.

==Memorials==
A memorial erected in 1854 honoured the Prussian army at Leuthen. Frederick&#x27;s great-great nephew, King Frederick William IV, ordered a victory column with a gilded goddess of victory at Heidau north-west of Leuthen. The Berlin architect Friedrich August Stüler provided the design for the monument, and Christian Daniel Rauch created the goddess of victory. The sculptor Heinrich Menzel from Neisse constructed the column in his workshop, in local white-gray stone. Moritz Geiss executed the plinth and the goddess in zinc casting and gilded the statue Victoria for a better effect. Befitting its importance in the establishment of the Prussian state and the mythos of Frederick the Great, the monument reached . During or after the Second World War, soldiers or partisans dynamited the monument, and only ruins of its pedestal remain, renovated in 2011.

<text>The Battle of Zorndorf, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, was fought on 25 August 1758 between Russian troops commanded by Count William Fermor and a Prussian army commanded by King Frederick the Great. The battle was tactically inconclusive, with both armies holding their ground and claiming victory. The site of the battle was the Prussian village of Zorndorf (now Sarbinowo, Poland). During the battle, Frederick famously took a regimental standard and led an attack himself, rallying his troops.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
Although the Seven Years&#x27; War was a global conflict, it was particularly intense in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, the prosperous province of Silesia as a consequence of the First and Second Silesian Wars. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Silesian province. In 1754, escalating tensions with Britain in North America offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Seeing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia&#x27;s growing power, Austria put aside the old rivalry with France to form a new coalition. Faced with this turn of events, Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king&#x27;s territories held in personal union, including Hanover but also those of his relatives in the Electorate of Hanover and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

At the outset of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, the course of the war had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had achieved spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen, and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen back to Austria. The Prussians then pressed south into Austrian Moravia. In April 1758, Prussia and Britain concluded the Anglo-Prussian Convention in which the British committed to pay Frederick an annual subsidy of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 7,000–9,000 troops to reinforce the army of Frederick&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Ferdinand evicted the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758; he crossed the Rhine, causing general alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand&#x27;s victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of Düsseldorf, successful maneuvering of larger French forces required him to withdraw across the Rhine.

After the Battle of Kolín, having pushed the Prussians out of Bohemia in the summer of 1757, and the cleverly waged campaign in the autumn that saw Lieutenant-General the Duke of Bevern&#x27;s Prussians defeated at the Battle of Breslau (22 November 1757), Empress Maria Theresa of Austria believed her fortunes were taking a turn for the better; however, the situation soon changed when Frederick defeated, first, the French at Rossbach and, then, the Austrians at Leuthen. In August 1758, Austria&#x27;s ally Russia invaded East Prussia. 42,590 troops under William Fermor advanced within of Berlin, and were poised to join the Austrians under Field Marshal Daun. King Frederick understood that the joining of his enemies would spell the fall of Berlin and, deciding to forestall their plans, moved to the Russian rear. Fermor, who was then besieging Küstrin, learned about this maneuver from a Cossack sortie. He lifted the siege and occupied a position at Zorndorf, northeast of Küstrin. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had reached a draw. None of Prussia&#x27;s enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia&#x27;s heartland.

While Ferdinand kept the French occupied in the Rhineland, Prussia had to contend with Sweden, Russia, and Austria. There remained a possibility that Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland-Lithuania or Russia: for Prussia, this represented an entirely nightmarish scenario.
By 1758, Frederick was concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. East of the Oder river in Brandenburg-Neumark, a Prussian army of 36,000 men fought a Russian army of 42,590 at Zorndorf on 25 August 1758.
==Terrain==
Zorndorf is a sizeable hamlet in a peat wilderness, full of scraggy firs, heaths, and cultivated spaces resembling light green islands in a mass of dark fir. In the mid-18th century, it was very marshy, full of bogs; eventually Prussians developed a firm broad road, but this was not even dreamed of in 1758, when it was characterized by bog pools and a semi island some from the Oder river, and about above the river. Thomas Carlyle, who toured the ground 100 years later, investigated some of the old records: he called these marshes &quot;leakages&quot; approximately 2–3 miles broad, mostly bottomless and woven with sluggish creeks and stagnant pools. Zorndorf lies at the crown of this morass of nearly impassable terrain.

==Battle==

On 25 August Frederick&#x27;s infantry attacked a Russian &quot;Observation Corps,&quot; which consisted of young conscripts only. The Russians managed to hold their own until the famed cavalry of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz struck against them. The Russian cavalry clashed with the Prussians, but was routed and had to flee towards the lines of the Russian infantrymen who, confused by clouds of dust and gun smoke, mistook them for the Prussians and opened artillery fire.

In the meantime, Frederick&#x27;s infantry fell upon the left wing of the Russian army. Frederick intended to repeat the oblique order assault that had granted him victory at the Battle of Leuthen, yet as the Russian lines were unable to retreat due to the swamps in their rear, and the left flank of Frederick&#x27;s army was likewise unable to enclose the Russian lines because of the unfavorable terrain and successful Russian resistance, the battle took the course of an extremely bloody, frontal clash of the adversaries&#x27; armies within a narrow battlefield setting.

During the ensuing battle, both sides quickly ran out of gunpowder and engaged in hand-to-hand fighting. When some of the Prussian battalions showed signs of tiring, Frederick himself led them in an attack. The battle was described by contemporaries as the bloodiest in the 18th century. One Prussian officer reported that &quot;bodies of Russians covered the field row by row; they kissed their cannons while their bodies were cut to pieces by our sabers, but still they would not retreat.&quot; After the battle, Frederick famously declared that &quot;it&#x27;s easier to kill the Russians than to win over them.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The Prussians lost 11,390 men and immediately claimed that the Russians numbered 70,000 men and lost between 20,000 and 22,000 in total. Two days later they claimed to have defeated 80,000 men and killed 26,000; eventually, this inflated number rose to 30,000 dead in a letter of Frederick to his sister. The actual Russian losses were about 16,000 men, still a significant number. That the Russians took such heavy casualties and did not pull back, left an imprint on the Prussian soldiers and upon Frederick himself. Before the battle he regarded the Russian army as weaker than his own, but in this battle the Russians proved themselves tough opponents and Frederick was frustrated by their tenacity. The battle appeared inconclusive: since neither side was driven from the battlefield, both could declare themselves victorious. However, Fermor, unlike Frederick, did not report his possible &quot;victory,&quot; he admitted that he had suffered heavy losses and retreated in order after the end of the battle.

The Russians had no choice but to leave the region; the heavy extractions they had exacted on the countryside meant there was nothing to keep man or beast alive. The Prussians still had their supplies, but otherwise were in the same position as the Russians. Nonetheless, Frederick ended the battle in possession of the terrain, with his lines of communication intact, and his fighting force mobile. The Russians also had disputes with the Austrians. The envoy from Vienna, while in the Russian camp, cast doubts upon Fermor&#x27;s competence. Fermor responded with detraction on the Austrians&#x27; abilities, who had not sent even an auxiliary corps to his assistance. The Austrians were, instead, preparing for a thrust into Saxony against the weaker army Frederick had left behind under the command of his younger brother, Prince Henry. The Austrians advanced so slowly, Henry and his army were gone when the Austrians arrived; and all they managed to achieve during Frederick&#x27;s absence was to capture a minor Prussian fortress and a garrison of 1,400. Even that feat was a modest one, and achieved by Imperial (&quot;Reichsarmee&quot;) troops, not Austrian ones.

After the fighting, Frederick withdrew his cavalry to stop their incessant and destructive skirmishing with the Cossacks, thereby allowing the Russian army to re-establish contact with their baggage wagons. Fermor sent a letter to Saint Petersburg, assembled his troops into two columns and marched towards Landsberg to link up with the forces of Count Pyotr Rumyantsev. Upon hearing the news of the battle, three Allied capitals, Saint Petersburg, Vienna and Paris, celebrated a triumph. In fact, Fermor&#x27;s statement reported that he had lost the opportunity to &quot;take a decisive victory in battle and suffered heavy losses.&quot; As Fermor left, Frederick was eager to proclaim it a retreat, although in reality the Russians were not fleeing and marched in perfect order, not being harried by the remaining Prussian troops. The Prussians followed them but refrained from launching another attack. This retreat prevented the Russians from reaching their Austrian allies and allowed Frederick to claim the battle as his victory, a view also popular in 19th century historiography, but historians still disputed the outcome.

== In culture ==
Carl Röchling&#x27;s 1904 depiction, &quot;Frederick the Great in the Battle of Zorndorf Before the Frontline of the von Bülow Regiment&quot;, became a widely perceived symbol of the early 20th century ideal of soldiers&#x27; heroism.

<text>The Battle of Hochkirch took place on 14 October 1758, during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War). After several weeks of maneuvering for position, an Austrian army of 80,000 commanded by Lieutenant Field Marshal Leopold Josef Graf Daun surprised the Prussian army of 30,000–36,000 commanded by Frederick the Great. The Austrian army overwhelmed the Prussians and forced a general retreat. The battle took place in and around the village of Hochkirch, east of Bautzen, Saxony.

Historians generally consider the battle as among Frederick&#x27;s greatest blunders. Contrary to the advice of his subordinates, he refused to believe that the typically cautious Austrian commander Leopold von Daun would bring his troops into battle. The Austrian force ambushed his army in a pre-dawn attack. Over 30% of Frederick&#x27;s army was defeated; five generals were killed, and he lost his artillery park and a vast quantity of supplies. Although Daun had scored a complete surprise, his attempt to pursue the retreating Prussians was unsuccessful. The escaped force united with another corps in the vicinity and regained momentum over the winter.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Although the Seven Years&#x27; War was a global conflict, it took a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, the prosperous province of Silesia. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as recovering the Silesian province. In 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in North America offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Seeing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia&#x27;s growing power, Austria put aside its old rivalry with France to form a new coalition. Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king&#x27;s European territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his relatives in the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

At the outset of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, the course of the war had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia achieved spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen, and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria. The Prussians then pressed south into Austrian Moravia. In April 1758, Prussia and Britain concluded the Anglo-Prussian Convention in which the British committed to pay Frederick an annual subsidy of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 7,000–9,000 troops to reinforce the army of Frederick&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Ferdinand evicted the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758; he crossed the Rhine, causing general alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand&#x27;s victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of Düsseldorf, successful maneuvering of larger French forces required him to withdraw across the Rhine.

While Ferdinand kept the French occupied, Prussia had to contend with Sweden, Russia, and Austria. There remained a possibility that Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: for Prussia, this represented an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. East of the Oder river in Brandenburg-Neumark, a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000 at the Battle of Zorndorf on 25 August 1758. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had reached a draw. None of Prussia&#x27;s enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia&#x27;s heartland.

==Prelude==
In September and early October 1758, Lieutenant Field Marshal Count Leopold Joseph von Daun and his 80,000-man army camped near the town of Stolpen. They had covered the from Görlitz in 10 days. Frederick had left half of his army in Pomerania near Zorndorf to make sure the Russians stayed on the defensive, and rushed south— in seven days—with the remainder of his army to confront Daun in Saxony. Upon arrival, Frederick announced that he and his army, now totaling 45,000, were ready to knock Daun&#x27;s head off. He referred to Daun as &quot;die dicke Exzellenz&quot; (the fat Excellency).

There, between Bautzen and Löbau, Frederick and Daun played their game of cat and mouse. Frederick had tried several times to draw the Austrians out of Stolpen into a battle: Daun, who seldom attacked unless he had a perfect position, had refused the bait. Frederick and his army had marched within of the Austrians, but Daun had pulled his army away, again, refusing to be drawn into battle. Upon the Austrian withdrawal, Frederick sent troops in pursuit; these were driven off by Daun&#x27;s rearguard. In frustration, Frederick shadowed Daun by maneuvering his army toward Bautzen; while there, Frederick learned that Daun had established a camp about east of him in the hills directly east of Hochkirch. He dispatched an entire Prussian corps commanded by General Wolf Frederick von Retzow to those hills in late September; by early October, Retzow&#x27;s corps was within of the Austrians. Frederick ordered Retzow to take the hill that commanded the area, called Strohmberg. When Retzow arrived there, he discovered that the Austrians already had laid possession with a strong force. Retzow chose not to attack; Frederick had him removed from command and arrested.

==Dispositions==

Hochkirch stands on a slight rise in terrain, surrounded by mildly undulating plains; the village can be seen from the distance, except from the south, where several heights abut the village and block visibility. The church stands near the highest point, granting visibility east, west and north.

On 10 October, Frederick marched on Hochkirch and established his own camp, extending from the town north, to the edge of the forest at the base of the Kuppritzerberg. Frederick did not plan to stay in the small village for an extended period, only until provisions—mostly bread—arrived from Bautzen, and then they would move eastward. To the east of the village, less than distant, the Austrians&#x27; presence on the hilltop increasingly made the Prussians—except Frederick—anxious about an attack. Frederick ignored the warnings of his officers, especially his trusted Field Marshal James Keith, who thought staying in the village was suicide. &quot;If the Austrians leave us unmolested in this camp,&quot; Keith told the king, &quot;they deserve to be hanged.&quot; Frederick reportedly replied, &quot;it is to be hoped they are more afraid of us than of the gallows.&quot;

Instead of worrying about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun&#x27;s army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal purpose of the infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. He did not believe any attack would occur; Daun&#x27;s army had been dormant in recent months, refusing to be drawn into battles.

The Imperial court in Vienna criticized Daun for his failure to act; the Empress and her ministers worried that the Russians and the French would drop out of the coalition if there were no action. Daun, a cautious and diligent commander, took his time to make his plans. The Strohmberg, one of the heights abutting Hochkirch, anchored Daun&#x27;s left flank, and he deployed the remainder of his force southward across the road between Bautzen and Loebau. This also gave him control of an important junction between Görlitz in the east and Zittau in the south. He anchored the far right end of his line in another wooded hill south of the road, the Kuppritzerberg, on the opposite side of the hill from the Prussians. Despite the proximity, the Prussians neither increased their security nor deployed their troops in response to the Austrian presence. The cautious Daun also took into account that his men were eager to fight a battle and that they outnumbered the Prussians by more than two-to-one. His men made a great production of hewing the trees in a nearby forest, action which Frederick interpreted as efforts to create field works, not, as it was actually intended, to build a road through the thick wood. Daun also had discovered a secret weakness of Frederick&#x27;s. His own personal secretary had been sending Frederick information on Daun&#x27;s plans, secreted in deliveries of eggs; upon discovering this, Daun promised the man his life in return for his cooperation in continuing to send Frederick misinformation. Daun&#x27;s plan, which he had kept secret, was an early morning sweep through the woods with 30,000 specially picked troops, around Frederick&#x27;s flank, to enclose him. The Prussian army would be asleep, both literally and figuratively, when the Austrian army struck.

==Battle==

Daun&#x27;s battle plan took the Prussians completely by surprise. The east side of Frederick&#x27;s line was the first to be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called &quot;Blutgasse&quot;, or Blood Alley.

Initially, Frederick thought the sounds of the battle were either an outpost skirmish or the Croats, who apparently started their days with regular firing of their weapons. His staff had trouble rousing him from bed, but he was soon alerted when Prussian cannons, captured by the Austrians, started to fire on his own camp.

While Frederick&#x27;s adjutants were trying to wake him, his generals, most of whom had not slept and had kept their horses saddled and weapons ready, organized the Prussian resistance. Keith had anticipated an Austrian attack and organized a slashing counterattack on the Austrians holding the Prussian battery. Maurice von Anhalt-Dessau, another of Frederick&#x27;s able generals, funneled the awakening troops to Keith. Combined, this action briefly retook the Prussian battery south of Hochkirch, but they could not hold it in the face of Austrian muskets. At 6:00, three more Prussian regiments rushed Hochkirch itself, while Prince Maurice continued directing stragglers and reinforcements into the counterattack. The Prussians swept through the village, out the other side, and fell on the battery at bayonet point. By that point, though, most Prussian order and cohesion had been lost. The Austrians, supported by their appropriated Prussian guns, which had not been spiked, wrought havoc on the attackers. Keith was hit mid-body and knocked out of his saddle, dead as he fell.
When the early morning fog had lifted, the soldiers could distinguish friend from foe. Prussian cavalry, which had remained saddled and ready throughout the night, launched a series of regimental counterattacks. A battalion of the 23rd Infantry charged, but withdrew as it was surrounded flank and rear. The church yard, a walled stronghold, diverted the Austrians; Major Siegmund Moritz William von Langen&#x27;s musketeers of the 19th regiment held it with determination and provided safety for retreating Prussians. Most importantly, Langen bought time.

By this time fully awake, Frederick hoped that the battle could be retrieved and returned to the village to take command. At 7:00, finding his infantry milling about in the village, Frederick ordered them to advance, sending reinforcements commanded by Prince Francis of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, his brother-in-law, with them. As Francis approached the village, Austrian cannon-fire sheared his head off his shoulders; his troops faltered, demoralized by the sight of the prince&#x27;s headless body atop his spooked horse. Frederick himself helped to rally Francis&#x27; shaken troops.

By 7:30, the Austrians had retaken the burning village, but their hold on it was tenuous. Keith and Prince Francis were dead. General Karl von Geist lay among the injured. Maurice von Anhalt-Dessau had been injured and captured. By 9:00, the Prussian left wing began to collapse under the weight of the Austrian assault; the last Prussian battery was overrun and turned against them. Led by the King, they advanced against five Austrian companies of hussars commanded by Franz Moritz von Lacy. Within a dozen yards of the Austrian line of infantry, Frederick&#x27;s horse was killed. His own hussars rescued him from capture.

As he withdrew, Frederick established a fighting line north of the village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were out of range of the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.

==Aftermath==

In five hours, Frederick lost 9,400 of the 30,000 men he brought into the battle, more than 30 percent of his army, including five generals, 101 guns, and nearly all the tents. Frederick required his generals to set an example of courage and leadership: they led from the front. The same rate of attrition applied throughout the officer corps, which lost half of its strength in the first three campaigns of the war. In addition to human losses, they lost valuable horses and draft animals, 70 munitions wagons, and, a blow to morale, 28 flags, and two standards. On the positive side, Retzow&#x27;s corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.

The Austrians suffered casualties and losses at about three percent. According to the Austrian historian Gaston Bodart, there were fewer troops participating than most modern sources suggest: he places Austrian participants at 60,000, losses in casualties at 5,400, approximately 8.3 percent, but other losses (to injuries, desertions and capture) at about 2,300, or 3.6 percent. They also lost three standards. Some modern historians place the overall losses higher, at 7,300. Notification of the battle arrived in Vienna during the celebration of the Empress&#x27;s name day, to the delight of Maria Theresa and her court, gathered at Schönbrunn Palace. Daun received a blessed sword and hat from Pope Clement XIII, a reward usually granted for defeating &quot;infidels&quot;. The Empress eventually created an endowment of 250,000 florins for Daun and his heirs.

For Daun and Lacy, it was a victory of mixed emotions; upon the discovery of Keith&#x27;s body in the village church, they both broke down in tears of grief. Keith had been the best friend of Lacy&#x27;s father during his service in Russia. Similarly, the grief Frederick felt at the loss of one of his greatest friends was intense. His grief was added to when he learned a couple of days later that his beloved elder sister, Wilhelmine, who had shared their father&#x27;s wrath in 1730 during the Katte affair, had died on the same day. He sulked in his tent for a week. At one point, he showed his librarian a small box of opium capsules, 18 in total, that he could use to &quot;journey to a dark place from which there was no return.&quot; Despite having rescued his army from catastrophe, he remained depressed and suicidal.

Although Frederick demonstrated good leadership by rallying his troops against the surprise attack, Hochkirch is considered one of his worst losses, and it badly shook his equanimity. Andrew Mitchell, the British envoy who was with them, and normally wrote positively about Frederick, attributed Frederick&#x27;s loss to the contempt he had for Daun&#x27;s supposedly cautious nature and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with what he imagined was true: according to Mitchell, there was no one to blame but himself. That winter, Mitchell described the 46-year-old Frederick as &quot;an old man lacking half of his teeth, with greying hair, without gaiety or spark or imagination.&quot; Frederick suffered from gout and influenza, and refused to change his uniform, which was moth-eaten and covered in food and snuff stains.

However, the situation could have been far worse for Frederick. The fabled discipline of his army held up: once the Prussians were out of the burning village, unit cohesion and discipline returned. Their discipline neutralized any strategic advantage the Austrians could have gained, and Daun&#x27;s hesitation nullified the rest. Instead of following Frederick, or cutting off Retzow&#x27;s division, which had not participated in the battle, Daun withdrew to the heights and positions he had occupied before the battle, so that his men might have a good rest under blankets after the fatigue of the day. After staying there for six days, they marched out in stealth to take up a new position between Belgern and Jesewitz, while Frederick remained at Doberschütz. Ultimately, the costly Austrian victory decided nothing.

The Austrian failure to follow up with Frederick meant that the Prussians lived to fight another day. Daun took great criticism for this, but not from the people who mattered the most, the Empress and her minister Kaunitz. For Frederick, instead of having the war decided at Hochkirch, he had the opportunity over the winter to rebuild his army. In two years of fighting (1756–1757) Frederick had lost over 100,000 soldiers to death, wounds, capture, disease and desertion. By Hochkirch, many regiments were only half-disciplined. In the winter after Hochkirch, he could only replace his soldiers with untrained men, many of whom would be foreigners and prisoners-of-war; he would be starting 1759 with a half-trained army of recruits, and seasoned soldiers who were exhausted by the slaughter. The only way he could hire men would be with British gold.

Frederick&#x27;s reputation for aggressiveness meant he could still terrify the Austrians simply by showing up. On 5 November, the anniversary of his great victory at Rossbach, Frederick marched toward Neisse, causing the Austrians to abandon their siege. A few weeks later, as Frederick marched further west, Daun took the entire army into winter quarters in Bohemia. Consequently, despite major losses, at the end of the campaign year, Frederick remained in possession of Saxony and Silesia, and his name remained feared in at least that part of Europe.

==Memorials==
A granite monument, inlaid with a bronze plaque, was erected by the inhabitants of Hochkirch in memory of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall Jacob von Keith&quot; and his achievement. The inscription reads &quot;Suffering, Misery, Death.&quot;

<doc id="446479" wikidata="Q17004578" url="?curid=446479" title="Asset-based economy">
<text>The asset-based economy is a post-industrial macroeconomic state of capitalism in which growth is based largely on appreciation of equity assets, typically financial instruments such as stocks, as well as real estate.

The term has been applied, often in a derogatory sense, to the economic conditions in the United States in the 2000s, during the recovery from the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

==Overview==
In an asset-based economy, manufacturing, as well as perhaps services, no longer provide the engine for growth. Rather the appreciation of assets leads to an increased net worth among individuals which, in the direct sense, can serve as collateral for borrowing, which in turn creates greater demand for goods and services. Proponents of the model often advocate reduction of tax rates in order to stimulate greater demand for assets, which in turn raises asset prices yielding even greater equity.

Critics of the asset-based economy contend that it is highly flawed because it depends on the continuation of low interest rates to stimulate the borrowing that will finance the purchase of assets at a rate sufficient to sustain the upward trend in asset prices. Thus, they reason, the model is highly vulnerable to the perhaps inevitable decreases in the real estate and financial markets.

Defenders of the model argue that the asset-based model need not be a permanent condition, but can be viewed as a stop-gap measure until demand for goods and services increases enough to sustain growth without low interest rates.

<text>The Battle of Kay (), also referred to as the Battle of Sulechów, Battle of [[Züllichau]], or Battle of Paltzig, was an engagement fought on 23 July 1759 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. It occurred near Kay (Kije) in the Neumark, now part of Poland.

General Carl Heinrich von Wedel, the commander of the Prussian army of 26,000–28,000 men, attacked a larger Russian army of 40,000–41,000 men commanded by Count Pyotr Saltykov. The Prussians lost in the region of 7,669 men; the Russians lost around 4,804. After the battle, King Frederick II of Prussia was determined to force the Russians into a decisive engagement in order to prevent them joining up with the main Austrian army. Three weeks later, the Prussians met the combined Russian-Austrian army at Kunersdorf.

==Situation in the Seven Years&#x27; War==

By 1759, Prussia had reached a strategic defensive position in the war. Upon leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in Lower Silesia; this forced the main Habsburg army to remain in its winter staging position in Bohemia. The Russians, however, shifted their forces into western Poland and marched westward toward the Oder river, a move that threatened the Prussian heartland, Brandenburg, and potentially Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending an army corps commanded by Friedrich August von Finck to contain the Russians; he sent a second column commanded by Christoph II von Dohna to support Finck.

The Austrian and Russian goal was twofold. The Austrians had advanced to the northern Bohemian frontier river Queis (Kwisa), the frontier between Lusatia and Silesia, and occupied a of the frontier between Austria and Prussia in Silesia. From there, Leopold Joseph von Daun could cross into either Lusatia or Silesia, as needed. The Allies held a council of war on 8 July, and Saltykov pressed for a crossing into Silesia. Daun was still reluctant to do so, but he did send Ernst Gideon von Laudon with the auxiliary corps. Part of Daun&#x27;s reluctance was based on what Frederick and his brother, Henry, might do.

Frederick left his encampment near Landeshut on 4 July and marched north west toward Lowenberg, east of Daun&#x27;s position on 10 July. At the same time, his brother marched with the main army from Saxony to Sagan, in Silesia. This effectively separated Daun from Saltykov. Knowing, though, that Loudon&#x27;s corps was not sufficient to fully support the Russian ally, he sent also Count András Hadik&#x27;s 17,000-man observation corps from northern Bohemia. This corps had been shadowing Henry&#x27;s army and Hadik broke off his contact with Henry&#x27;s force on 22 July, crossing into Lusatia at Zwickau.

==Dispositions==
Upon orders from Empress Elizabeth, Saltykov moved on Prussia in a methodical advance beginning in June 1759. Some estimates place his army as high as 70,000 men; others suggest he had approximately 41,000 in June and July. Upon learning of this advance, Frederick ordered General Dohna to halt the Russian westward advance. Dohna had a force of 26,000 at his disposal, including several companies of cavalry.

In mid-July, Dohna and Saltykov spent a week feinting with each other as Saltykov drew closer to the Prussian border. On 14 July, he turned southwest, making for the Oder river, somewhere between Crossen and Glogau. By 19 July, he had reached the Silesian front near Züllichau (Sulechów), where Saltykov planned to rest his troops for a couple of days.
The third commander of the Russian force in three years, he was still relatively new to the command of this army, and spent a couple of days consulting with his chief officers and getting to know the strengths and weaknesses of his army, and letting them get to know him. In a course of meetings with his staff, however, he excluded the Austrian commanders with him, a telling comment on his distrust of the Habsburg staff.

Monitoring this from afar, and dissatisfied with Dohna&#x27;s timidity in bringing Saltykov to battle, Frederick sent Carl Heinrich von Wedel to take command. Wedel arrived on 20 July and established a blocking position at Züllichau. This would prevent the Russians from entering Prussian territory and reaching the Oder. He wanted to attack the Russians at dawn the next day, but could not find an appropriately weak location in the Russian defenses.

On the same day as Wedel arrived, 20 July, Saltykov established himself astride the Prussian communication line at the Oder, strengthening his already formidable position. This effectively cut any Prussian advance or reinforcement from Crossen (Krosno) or Frankfurt on the Oder. At this point, the Russians occupied the heights by Kay and additional high ground by Mosau (Mozów). A stream, the Eichmühlen Fliess, flowed in a swampy depression just to the east of the town. It could be crossed only at a single narrow point on the road east of Kay, directly opposite the Russian center; a second crossing could be made immediately south of Kay, which would permit an assault on the Russian right flank. This seemed reasonable to Wedel, but only if the Russians were not fully deployed.

By 23 July, Wedel had received direct orders from the impatient Frederick to secure a &quot;good position&quot;, by which the king meant defensible ground, and to use the preferred means of attack, by which the King meant &quot;oblique order&quot;. Wedel knew he must bring the Russians to battle before they could move on Frankfurt or risk his reputation with the King. On 23 July, Wedel ordered another reconnaissance of Saltykov&#x27;s troops at Langen Meil, a small settlement outside Kay, and found them in motion; assuming they meant to move on Frankfurt, he subsequently ordered an advance on the Russian right flank. Wedel&#x27;s best opportunity seemed to be securing the Paltzig heights before the Russians could do so, and the best way to do that would be through Kay.
==Battle==
The Prussian army marched in two columns toward Kay, one on the road directly to Kay, and the other on the road to Mosau. Barely had they emerged from the ravines surrounding the town when they fell into combat with some Russian skirmishers. The Prussians repulsed the initial group, but the arrival of reinforcement meant the onset of generalized action. The Russians subsequently fired on the Prussians from the heights surrounding Kay. General Heinrich von Manteuffel took six battalions and attacked on the artillery; initially they threw him back. A contemporary participant maintained that Manteuffel succeeded in over-running the positions and took 40 pieces of cannon, but there is no official evidence to support his statement. There were three assaults at Kay in that afternoon, and each was thrown back.

General Manteuffel had been injured in the attack on the position. Wedel ordered a full cavalry assault through the woods and against the Russian right flank. When the superior Russian force countered, Prussian momentum faltered with the lack of a second column of timely reinforcement. Repeated assaults on the Russians entrenched in the heights resulted in massive losses for the Prussians. In the last of these assaults, Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow led eight battalions and six squadrons from Züllichau against the Russian right wing. At the same time his cavalry penetrated the enemy&#x27;s infantry line, but the Russian cavalry, supported by gun-fire, drove them and the infantry back into the low ground.

==Aftermath==
In the second assault, Manteufel was injured and in the final one, General Wobersnow was killed. Wedel lost up to 8,300 of his troops, although Frederick saw fit to announce losses of only 800, and placed Russian losses at over 7,000. Frederick also blamed the troops, calling them cowardly &quot;scoundrels&quot; despite their repeated and suicidal assaults. He eventually estimated Prussian losses at 1,400, and the Russian losses at 14,000, but he was fooling himself.

The loss at Kay laid open the road to the Oder river and by 28 July Saltykov&#x27;s troops had reached Crossen. He did not enter Prussia at this point, though, largely due to his problematic relationship with the Austrians. Neither Saltykov or Daun trusted one another; Saltykov neither spoke German nor trusted the translator. Daun did not want to risk losing his entire force. Although Frederick had departed from Saxony in early July, and his brother had marched north at that time too, Daun feared that either of these armies would double back. This not only would prevent him from uniting with Saltykov&#x27;s army, it could expose his army to Frederick&#x27;s overpowering force. Instead, Daun sent his auxiliary corps, commanded by Loudon to join with Saltykov. Upon hearing this news, Saltykov considered Daun to be hesitant and dilatory. Eventually, Hadik and Loudon joined at Priebus (Przewóz), north of Görlitz, on 29 July. In the meantime, Daun had sent additional reinforcements to Loudon, some of the best regiments of the Austrian army; by the time Loudon would reach the Oder, Daun calculated that his force would be at least 20,000, certainly sufficient to shore up Saltykov&#x27;s already sizable force. On 3 August, the Russians occupied Frankfurt, while the main army camped outside the city on the east bank, and began constructing field fortifications, in preparation for Frederick&#x27;s eventual arrival. By the following week, Daun&#x27;s reinforcements joined forces with Saltykov at Kunersdorf.

<text>The Battle of Minden was a major engagement during the Seven Years&#x27; War, fought on 1 August 1759. An Anglo-German army under the overall command of Prussian Field Marshal Ferdinand of Brunswick defeated a French army commanded by Marshal of France, Marquis de Contades. Two years previously, the French had launched a successful invasion of Hanover and attempted to impose an unpopular treaty of peace upon the allied nations of Britain, Hanover and Prussia. After a Prussian victory at Rossbach, and under pressure from Frederick the Great and William Pitt, King George II disavowed the treaty. In 1758, the allies launched a counter-offensive against the French and Saxon forces and drove them back across the Rhine.

After the allies failed to defeat the French before reinforcements swelled their retreating army, the French launched a fresh offensive, capturing the fortress of Minden on 10 July. Believing Ferdinand&#x27;s forces to be over-extended, Contades abandoned his strong positions around the Weser and advanced to meet the Allied forces in battle. The decisive action of the battle came when six regiments of British and two of Hanoverian infantry, in line formation, repelled repeated French cavalry attacks, contrary to all fears that the regiments would be broken. The Allied line advanced in the wake of the failed cavalry attack, sending the French army reeling from the field, ending all French designs upon Hanover for the remainder of the year.

In Britain, the victory is celebrated as contributing to the Annus Mirabilis of 1759.

==Background==
The western German-speaking states of Europe had been a major theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War since 1757, when the French had launched an invasion of Hanover. This culminated in a significant victory for the French at the Battle of Hastenbeck and the attempted imposition of the Convention of Klosterzeven upon the defeated allies: Hanover, Prussia and Britain. Prussia and Britain refused to ratify the convention and, in 1758, a counter-offensive commanded by Ferdinand saw French forces first driven back across the Rhine, and then beaten at the Battle of Krefeld. The Prussian port of Emden was also recaptured, securing supply from Britain. In fact, the British government, which had previously been opposed to any direct involvement on the continent, took the opportunity of the 1758–59 winter break in fighting to send nine thousand British troops to reinforce Ferdinand. The French crown also sent a reinforcing army, under Contades, hoping this would help to secure a decisive victory, swiftly concluding the costly war, and forcing the Allies to accept the peace terms France was seeking.

In an attempt to defeat the French before their reinforcements arrived, Ferdinand decided to launch a fresh counter-offensive, and quit his winter quarters early. In April, however, Victor-François, Duke de Broglie and the French withstood Ferdinand&#x27;s attack at the Battle of Bergen, and de Broglie was promoted to Marshal of France. Ferdinand was forced to retreat northwards in the face of the now reinforced French army. Contades, senior of the two French marshals, resumed the advance, occupying a number of towns and cities including the strategic fortress at Minden, which fell to the French on 10 July. Ferdinand was criticised for his failure to check the French offensive. His celebrated brother-in-law, Frederick the Great, is reported as having suggested that, since his loss at Bergen, Ferdinand had come to believe the French to be invincible. Irrespective of any presumed crisis of confidence, however, Ferdinand did ultimately decide to confront the French, near Minden.

Contades had taken up a strong defensive position along the Weser around Minden, where he had paused to regroup before he continued his advance. He initially resisted the opportunity to abandon this strong position to attack Ferdinand. Ferdinand instead formulated a plan that involved splitting his force into several groups to threaten Contades&#x27; lines of supply. Perceiving Ferdinand&#x27;s forces to be over-extended, Contades thought he saw a chance for the desired decisive victory. He ordered his men to abandon their defensive encampments and advance into positions on the plain west of Minden during the night of 31 July and early morning of 1 August.

==Topography==

The city of Minden lies at the confluence of the northwards flowing Weser and the Bastau, a marshy tributary rivulette coming from the west. The Battle of Minden took place on the plain in front of the city and its fortifications to its northwest, with the Weser and Bastau lying behind the city to its east and south respectively.

On the 31 of July, the French troops under Contades&#x27; direct command had their positions west of the Weser and south of the Bastau, crossing to the north over five pontoons during the night and early morning of the 1 of August. The French under the junior marshal De Broglie were stationed astride the Weser. Some were occupying Minden on the 31 of July, while the remainder, stationed east of the Weser, crossed over to join them during the night.
==Battle==
In an exception to the norm for the era, Contades placed his artillery in the centre protected only by the cavalry, with his infantry on each flank. The battle began on the French right flank, where Marshal de Broglie, who commanded the reserve, began an artillery duel against the allied left.

The decisive action of the battle took place in the centre, famously due to a misunderstanding of orders. Friedrich von Spörcken&#x27;s division, composed of the infantry of the British contingent of the allied army (two brigades under Earl Waldegrave and William Kingsley) and supported by the Hanoverian Guards, actually advanced to attack the French &quot;cavalry&quot;. It is reported that they had been ordered &quot;to advance [up-]&quot;on&quot; the beating of drums&quot; (i.e., advance when the signal drums begin to beat,) misunderstanding this as &quot;to advance &quot;to&quot; the beating of drums&quot; (i.e., advance immediately while beating drums.) Since the French cavalry was still in its ranks and the famous &#x27;hollow square&#x27; had not yet been developed, it was assumed by all that the six leading British regiments were doomed. Despite being under constant artillery fire, the six regiments (soon supported by two Hanoverian battalions), by maintaining fierce discipline and closed ranks, drove off repeated cavalry charges with musket fire and inflicted serious casualties on the French. Contades reportedly said bitterly, &quot;I have seen what I never thought to be possible—a single line of infantry break through three lines of cavalry, ranked in order of battle, and tumble them to ruin!&quot;

Supported by the well-served British and Hanoverian artillery, the entire allied line eventually advanced against the French army and sent it fleeing from the field. The only French troops capable of mounting any significant resistance were those of de Broglie, who formed a fighting rear guard.

The following is an account of the battle by Lt. Hugh Montgomery of the 12th Regiment of Foot, to his mother:
==Aftermath==
Prince Ferdinand&#x27;s army suffered nearly 2,800 men killed and wounded; the French lost about 7,000 men. In the wake of the battle the French retreated southwards to Kassel. The defeat ended the French threat to Hanover for the remainder of that year.

Ferdinand&#x27;s cavalry commander, Lieutenant General Lord George Sackville, was accused of ignoring repeated orders to bring up his troopers and charge the enemy until it was too late to make any difference. In order to clear his name he requested a court martial, but the evidence against him was substantial and the court martial declared him &quot;...unfit to serve His Majesty in any military Capacity whatever.&quot; Sackville would later reappear as Lord George Germain and bear a major portion of the blame for the outcome of the American Revolution while Secretary of State for the Colonies.

In Britain the result at Minden was widely celebrated and was seen as part of Britain&#x27;s Annus Mirabilis of 1759 also known as the &quot;Year of Victories&quot;, although there was some criticism of Ferdinand for not following up his victory more aggressively. When George II of Great Britain learned of the victory, he awarded Ferdinand £20,000 and the Order of the Garter. Minden further boosted British support for the war on the continent, and the following year a &quot;glorious reinforcement&quot; was sent, swelling the size of the British contingent in Ferdinand&#x27;s army.

In France the reaction to the result was severe. The Duc de Choiseul, the French Chief Minister, wrote &quot;I blush when I speak of our army. I simply cannot get it into my head, much less into my heart, that a pack of Hanoverians could defeat the army of the King&quot;. To discover how the defeat had occurred and to establish the general condition of the army, Marshal d&#x27;Estrées was sent on a tour of inspection. Marshal de Contades was subsequently relieved of his command and replaced by the Duc de Broglie.

Michel Louis Christophe Roch Gilbert Paulette du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette and &quot;colonel aux Grenadiers de France&quot;, was killed when he was hit by a cannonball in this battle. La Fayette&#x27;s son, Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, was not even two years old at that time. Jean Thurel, the 59-year-old French fusilier, was severely wounded, receiving seven sword slashes, six of them to the head.

==In regimental tradition==
The British regiments which fought at Minden (with the successor British army unit which still uphold their traditions) were:
* Royal Artillery
* 12th of Foot (Suffolk Regiment), now part of The Royal Anglian Regiment
* 20th Foot (Lancashire Fusiliers), now part of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers
* 23rd Foot (Royal Welsh Fusiliers), now the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Welsh Fusiliers)
* 25th Foot (King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers), now The Royal Scots Borderers (1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland)
* 37th Foot (Royal Hampshire Regiment), now part of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment
* 51st Foot (King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry), now part of The Rifles

The descendants of these units are still known as &quot;the Minden Regiments.&quot;

When the British infantry and artillery were first advancing to battle they passed through some German gardens and the soldiers picked roses and stuck them in their coats. In memory of this, each of the Minden regiments marks 1 August as Minden Day. On that day the men of all ranks wear roses in their caps. The Royal Regiment of Artillery wear red roses, The Royal Anglians, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment wear red and yellow roses; the Scots wear red; the Rifles wear Yorkshire white roses. From this tradition, and to mark the heroism of the Yorkshiremen who fought, 1 August has been adopted as Yorkshire Day. The Royal Welch Fusiliers do not wear roses on Minden Day as the Minden Rose was incorporated into the roundel of their cap badge and so is worn every day of the year, though retired members of the Regiment do sport roses in the lapels on Minden Day. Artillery regiments with Minden associations (see below) also wear red roses.

This British victory was also recalled in the British Army&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Division which maintained the &quot;Minden Band&quot; until its 2006 amalgamation with the &quot;Normandy Band&quot; to form the Band of the Queen&#x27;s Division.

Two batteries from the Royal Regiment of Artillery carry the Minden battle honour. Soldiers from both 12 (Minden) Battery and 32 (Minden) Battery traditionally wear a red rose in their headdress on 1 August every year, both batteries celebrate Minden Day every year. A proud tradition exists: &#x27;Once a Minden Man, always a Minden Man.&#x27;.

Every year since 1967, six red roses have been anonymously delivered to the British consulate in Chicago on 1 August. Until they were closed, roses were also delivered to consulates in Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis, starting as early as 1958 in Kansas City. A note that comes with the roses lists the six regiments and says, &quot;They advanced through rose gardens to the battleground and decorated their tricorne hats and grenadier caps with the emblem of England. These regiments celebrate Minden Day still, and all wear roses in their caps on this anniversary in memory of their ancestors.&quot; The Embassy has asked for the name of the sender (on numerous occasions) so that they may thank the individual in person, but the identity of the donor remains a mystery.

== In Freemasonry ==
During the Cold War by 1972 some 50,000 British Forces were deployed to Germany. Minden at the time was well established as a Garrison with the Garrison HQ located within Kingsley Barracks, later also, in 1976 the home of HQ 11th Armoured Brigade. Since 1957, within BAOR (British Army of the Rhine), 11 British speaking Lodges had been founded under the Grand Land Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany. The closest Lodge at the time nearest to Minden was Britannia Lodge No. 843 of Bielefeld, some 50 km distance and, at the time, a 1-hour drive. A meeting was held in the Royal Electrical &amp; Mechanical Engineers (REME) Officers Mess, Johansen Str 1, Minden, on 24 June 1972, to determine whether it would be plausible to form a resident Lodge in Minden to fulfill the needs of Freemasons among the military serving there. This was agreed and a petition was sent to the Grand Land Master for review. Once the proposed By laws had been approved by the Grand Secretary the petition was signed and permission to form the Lodge was given on 13 August 1972. The consecration ceremony took place on 28 October 1972, but was held in Herford due to insufficient space the intended Lodge rooms could provide in Minden.

The name chosen for the Lodge was &quot;The Rose of Minden Lodge No.918&quot;. The name, suggested by Brother B. Potter at the initial meeting, was agreed as being a proper and sincere tribute to the British Forces serving in Minden, from which, many of its new and intended members were stationed.

When the Cold War ended in 1991, Minden was closed as a garrison, meaning that Lodge membership dwindled as the troops moved away. To counteract this migration of members, it was decided to move the lodge to Herford which was to become the home of 1st UK Armoured Division. The Lodge resides, and still does to this, at the place where it was originally consecrated and shares the Lodge house &quot;Logenhaus Unter den Linden 34, Herford&quot; with 4 other German Masonic Lodges.

British Forces were reduced again as part of the 2010 UK&#x27;s &quot;Strategic Defence and Security Review,&quot; (SDR), the Lodge now recruits its members from the expatriates living in and around the area, this also include German and other nationals interested in practicing Freemasonry in the English language following the English constitution provided by the United Grand Lodge of England. However, many of the members today who have decided to remain in Germany used to serve in the successors of above mention units and celebrate the 1 August as Minden Day.

<doc id="446483" wikidata="Q170400" url="?curid=446483" title="Battle of Kunersdorf">
<text>The Battle of Kunersdorf occurred on 12 August 1759 near Kunersdorf (now Kunowice, Poland) immediately east of Frankfurt an der Oder. Part of the Third Silesian War and the wider Seven Years&#x27; War, the battle involved over 100,000 men. An Allied army commanded by Pyotr Saltykov and Ernst Gideon von Laudon that included 41,000 Russians and 18,500 Austrians defeated Frederick the Great&#x27;s army of 50,900 Prussians.

The terrain complicated battle tactics for both sides, but the Russians and the Austrians, having arrived in the area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick&#x27;s deadly &quot;modus operandi&quot;, the oblique order. Although Frederick&#x27;s troops initially gained the upper hand in the battle, his limited scouting, combined with the strong defensive preparations of the Allied troops, gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when the combatants were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.

This was the only time in the Seven Years&#x27; War that the Prussian Army, under Frederick&#x27;s direct command, disintegrated into an undisciplined mass. With this loss, Berlin, only away, lay open to assault by the Russians and Austrians. However, Saltykov and Laudon did not follow up on the victory due to disagreement. Only 3,000 soldiers from Frederick&#x27;s original 50,000 remained with him after the battle, although many more had simply scattered and rejoined the army within a few days. This represented the penultimate success of the Russian Empire under Elizabeth of Russia and was arguably Frederick&#x27;s worst defeat.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Although the Seven Years&#x27; War was a global conflict, it took on a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, the prosperous province of Silesia as a consequence of the First and Second Silesian Wars. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as reacquiring Silesia. In 1754, escalating tensions between Great Britain and France in North America offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Recognizing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia&#x27;s growing power, the Empress put aside the old rivalry with France to form a new coalition. Faced with this turn of events, Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king&#x27;s territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his and Frederick&#x27;s relatives in the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

At the outset of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, the course of the war had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had achieved spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.
The Prussians then pressed south into Austrian Moravia. In April 1758, Prussia and Britain concluded the Anglo-Prussian Convention in which the British committed an annual subsidy of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 7,000–9,000 troops to reinforce the army of Frederick&#x27;s brother-in-law, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Ferdinand evicted the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758; he crossed the Rhine with his own forces, causing general alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand&#x27;s victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and his brief occupation of Düsseldorf, the successful maneuvering of larger French forces required him to withdraw across the Rhine.

While Ferdinand kept the French occupied, Prussia had to contend with Sweden, Russia, and Austria, all of which wanted to carve out a piece of Prussia for themselves. Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder river in Brandenburg–Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf, on 25 August 1758 a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army, but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had resulted in a draw. None of Prussia&#x27;s enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia&#x27;s heartland. The Austrian Feldmarshalleutnant Leopold Josef Graf Daun could have ended the war in October at Hochkirch, but he failed to follow up on his victory with a determined pursuit of Frederick&#x27;s retreating army. This allowed Frederick time to recruit a new army over the winter.

===Situation in 1759===
By 1759, Prussia had reached a strategic defensive position; Russian and Austrian troops surrounded Prussia, although not quite at the borders of Brandenburg. Upon leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in Lower Silesia; this forced the main Habsburg army to remain in its staging area in Bohemia. The Russians, however, shifted their forces into western Poland–Lithuania, a move that threatened the Prussian heartland, potentially Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending Generalleutnant Friedrich August von Finck&#x27;s army corps to contain the Russians. Finck&#x27;s corps was defeated at the Battle of Kay on 23 July. Subsequently, Pyotr Saltykov and the Russian forces advanced west to occupy Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July (on Germany&#x27;s border with present-day Poland). There he ordered entrenchment of their camp to the east, near Kunersdorf. To make matters worse for the Prussians, an Austrian corps commanded by Feldmarshalleutnant Ernst Gideon von Laudon joined Saltykov on 3–5 August. King Frederick rushed from Saxony, took over the remnants of Generalleutnant Carl Heinrich von Wedel&#x27;s contingent at Müllrose and moved toward the Oder River. By 9 August, he had 49,000–50,000 troops, enhanced by Finck&#x27;s defeated corps, and Prince Henry of Prussia&#x27;s corps moving from the Lausitz region.

==Preliminaries==
===Terrain===
The terrain surrounding Kunersdorf suited itself better to defense than offense. Between the Frankfurt dam, a long earthen bulwark that helped to contain the Oder river, and to the north of Kunersdorf itself stretched a line of knolls; Judenberge (Jews Hill), Mühlberge (Mill Hill) and Walkberge (also spelled Walckberge). None was more than high. The hillocks were steeper on the north side than the south, but bounded by a marshy, boggy meadow called the Elsbusch, or the Alder wasteland. East of Kunersdorf and the Walkberge, the Hühner Fliess (&quot;Fliess&quot; means running water) was joined by another stream that tumbled between two more hillocks. Past the Walkberge and beyond the Hühner stood two more promontories at Trettin.

Several ravines intersected the ridge of hillocks: starting at the northeastern end, the Bäckergrund joined the Hühner Fliess. Just east of the Walkberge a small ravine separated the Walkberge from the Mühlberge. Another narrow roadway cut through the Mühlberge ridge, then a second narrow depression, known as the Kuhgrund (cow hollow), lay west of that. Beyond the Kuhgrund, the ground rose again, then dipped into a fourth hollow in which lay a Jewish settlement known as a shtetl, and the ground rose into the Judenberge; from this point, one could overlook most of Frankfurt and its suburbs. To the southeast lay a variety of small promontories, called the Grosser- and Kleiner-Spitzberge. Like the northwest side of the ridge, this ground was covered with small ponds, streams, marshy fields, and broad meadows. Natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—would restrict wide movements on some of the terrain. To the east and north of the entire landscape lay the Forest of Reppen. Here the ground itself was sandy and unstable. The scrub forests were threaded with streams, springs, and bogs of all kinds.

===Allied dispositions===
The Russian army, which before the battle of Kay had about 40,000 men and lost 4,804 in the battle, after the battle of Kay had about 35,000 men. After the battle of Kay, it was joined by Pyotr Rumyantsev&#x27;s corps of 7,000 men and the Austrian army of General Laudon. On August 4, 1759, according to the inspection, the total number of the Russian army was 41,248 people. This number included the regular army of 33,000 people and irregular—about 8,000 light cavalry of the Cossacks and Kalmyks. During the battle of Kunersdorf Saltykov left a detachment of 266 men in Frankfurt and had 41,000 for the battle. The Austrian army had on 4 August 18,523 men. These figures are reflected in the documents and are used in Russian scientific literature. There are also numerous overestimates of the Russian army, originating from German and English sources—for example 79,000, 64,000, 69,000 and even 88,000—these numbers are not based on documents. For example, the number 79,000 comes from the addition of 55,000 Russians and 24,000 Austrians, and 55,000 Russians are, in turn, the result of an army that had an initial strength of 60,000 people, lost about 5,000 at the battle of Kay. In fact, 60,000 is the total number of all Russian troops in Prussia, including garrisons in different cities, troops for the protection of communications and so on.

A portion of the Russian force remained in Frankfurt as the Allied advanced guard. Saltykov had expected the Austrian commander-in-chief&#x27;s entire army to arrive; instead a mere wing under Laudon&#x27;s command came to his aid. Their collaboration was complicated by their personalities. Neither Laudon nor Saltykov had great command of operational arts. Saltykov did not like foreigners; Laudon thought Saltykov was inscrutable. Neither liked conversing through translators, and both mistrusted each other&#x27;s intentions.

Laudon wanted a fight, so he swallowed his differences and joined the Russians in building fortifications. Saltykov established his troops on a strong position from which to receive the Prussian attack, concentrating his force in the center, which he calculated was the best way to counter-act any attempt by Frederick to deploy his deadly oblique order. Saltykov entrenched himself in a position running from the Judenberge through the Grosser Spitzberge to the Mühlberge, creating a bristling line of fortifications, and faced his troops to the northwest; the Judenberge, most heavily fortified, fronted what he believed would be Frederick&#x27;s approach. He and the Austrian troops were stretched along the ridge that ran from the outskirts of Frankfurt to just north of the village of Kunersdorf. Anticipating that Frederick would rely on his cavalry, the Russians effectively negated any successful cavalry charge by using fallen trees to break up the ground on the approaches.

Saltykov had little concern about the extreme northwestern face of the ridge, which was steep and fronted by the marshy Elsbruch, but a few of the Austrian contingents faced northwest as a precaution. He expected Frederick to attack him from the west, from Frankfurt, and from the Frankfurt outer city. The Russians constructed redans and flèche to protect all the potentially weak points of their fortifications; they built glacis to cover the most shallow of the hills, and scarps and counterscarps to protect seemingly weak points. Abatis not only littered the hillsides, but dotted flat ground. By 10 August, his scouts had told him that Frederick was at the far western edge of Frankfurt. Accordingly, Saltykov took everything he could from the city by way of sustenance, all oxen, sheep, chickens, produce, wine, beer, in a flurry of ransacking.
===Prussian plans===
While Saltykov plundered the city and prepared for Frederick&#x27;s assault from the west, the Prussians reached Reitwein, some north of Frankfurt on 10 August, and built pontoon bridges during the night. Frederick crossed the Oder in the night and the next morning, and moved southward toward Kunersdorf; the Prussians established a staging area near Göritz (also spelled Gohritz on the old maps), about north-northeast of Kunersdorf late on 11 August with about 50,000 men; of these, 2,000 were deemed unfit for service and stayed behind to guard the baggage.

Frederick conducted a perfunctory reconnaissance of his enemy&#x27;s position, accompanied by a forest ranger and an officer who had previously been stationed in Frankfurt. He also consulted a peasant who, though garrulous, was uninformed about military needs: the peasant told the King that a natural obstacle between the Red Grange (a large farmstead between Kunersdorf and Frankfurt&#x27;s outer city) and Kunersdorf was unpassable; what the peasant did not know was that the Russians had been there long enough to construct a causeway linking these two sections. Looking to the east through his telescope, Frederick saw some wooded hills, called the Reppen Forest, and he believed he could use them to screen an advance, much like he had done at Leuthen. He did not send scouts to reconnoiter the land or question locals about the ground in the forest. Furthermore, through his glass he could see that the Russians were facing west and north, and their fortifications were stronger on the west. He decided &quot;all&quot; the Allies were facing northwest and that the forest was readily passable.

After his perfunctory reconnaissance, Frederick returned to his camp to develop his battle plan. He planned to direct a diversionary force, commanded by Finck, to the Hühner Fliess, to demonstrate in front of what he believed to be the main Russian line. He would march with his main army to the southeast of the Allied position, circling around Kunersdorf, screened by the Reppen Forest. This way, he thought, he would surprise his enemy, forcing the Allied army to reverse fronts, which is a complicated maneuver for even the best trained troops. Frederick could then employ his much feared oblique battle order, feinting with his left flank as he did so. Ideally, this would allow him to roll up the Allied line from the Mühlberge.

===Final dispositions===
Late in the afternoon on the 11th, wily Saltykov realized Frederick was not advancing on him from Frankfurt, and changed his plans. He inverted his flanks: instead of having the left wing at the shtetl and the right at Mühlberge, he reversed his flank with the right at the shtetl. Then the Russians set fire to Kunersdorf. Within hours, the only thing left was the stone church and some walls. While Frederick developed his plan to outflank Saltykov by maneuvering behind him, Saltykov outfoxed him.

==Battle==

Prussian activities began at 2:00 am on 12 August. Troops were roused and, within the hour, they set off. Finck&#x27;s corps had the shortest distance to travel, and the five brigades arrived at the assigned post, the high ground northeast of the Walkeberge, by dawn; Karl Friedrich von Moller established the artillery park on the highest ground at Trettin, and pointed it at the Walkberge, on the hills north of the Hühner Fleiss. Finck&#x27;s infantry and cavalry demonstrated in front of the five Russian regiments as a diversion, while the remainder of Frederick&#x27;s army continued in a semi-circle around the eastern flank of the Russian line, to approach from the village from the southeast. The grueling march took up to eight hours. Frederick intended to flank his opposition, and attack what he assumed would be its weakest side, but again, he sent no reconnaissance, not a single hussar or dragoon, to confirm his assumptions.

Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally realized he would end up facing his enemy, instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make an assault on the Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.

Frederick&#x27;s army became bogged down in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. The trees were thick and the ground was unstable and oozy in some parts, which made the movement of the heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were too wide to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled in the woods. The Russians could hear them, but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck&#x27;s column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 am., only Finck&#x27;s demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck&#x27;s right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck&#x27;s left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck&#x27;s artillery awaited Frederick&#x27;s signal, but the bulk of Frederick&#x27;s army still crashed about in the woods.
===Assault on the Mühlberge===

Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick&#x27;s army emerged from the woods, with most of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz&#x27;s cavalry and the rest of his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians emerged from the woods, and the Russians realized it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck&#x27;s artillery park had been in place since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset. For 30 minutes, the two sides bombarded each other.

At about noon, Frederick sent his first wave of soldiers toward the Russian position on the Mühlberge. Frederick favored mixed troops in such conditions, and his forward troops included grenadiers and musketeers, and some cuirassiers. The Prussian artillery batteries created an arc of fire on the Russian sector by the Walkberge and the Kleiner Spitzberge; the infantry could safely move under this arc. They advanced into the crevasse between the two hills; when they came within of the Russian guns on the Mühlberge, they charged at point-blank range. Some of Shuvalov&#x27;s Observation Corps, stationed on the summit, took substantial losses—perhaps 10 percent—before the Prussian grenadiers overwhelmed them. Prussian losses were also high. Frederick sent 4,300 men into this assault, immediately losing 206 of Prince Henry&#x27;s cuirassiers. Although Saltykov sent his own grenadiers to shore up the Russian defense, the Prussians carried the Mühlberge, capturing between 80 and 100 enemy cannons, which they immediately deployed against the Russians. For the moment, the Prussians held the position.

After capturing the cannons, the Prussians raked the retreating Russians with fire from their own pieces. The Russians were slaughtered by the score, losing most of five large regiments to injury and death. By 1:00 pm, the Russian left flank had been defeated and driven back on Kunersdorf itself, leaving behind small, disorganized groups capable of only token resistance. In panic, some of the Russians even fired on the Margrave of Baden-Baden&#x27;s troops, which also wore blue coats (although of a lighter blue), mistaking them for Prussians. Saltykov fed in more units, including a force of Austrian grenadiers led by Major Joseph De Vins, and gradually the situation stabilized.

===Attack stalled===
The Prussian position at Kunersdorf was not substantially better than it had been a few hours earlier, but it was, at least, defensible; the Russian position, on the other hand, was substantially worse. While Frederick&#x27;s principal force had assaulted the Mühlberg, Johann Jakob von Wunsch, with 4,000 men, had retraced his steps from Reitwein to Frankfurt and had captured the city by mid-day. The Prussians had effectively blocked the Allies from moving east, west or south, and the terrain blocked them from moving north; if they tried such a foolhardy move, Moller&#x27;s artillery would rake them with enfilade fire. The King&#x27;s brother, Prince Henry, and several other generals encouraged Frederick to stop there. The Prussians could defend Frankfurt from their vantage point on the Mühlberg and in the city itself. To descend into the valley, cross the Kuhgrund and ascend Spitzberge against frightful fire was foolhardy, they argued. Furthermore, the weather was blisteringly hot and the troops had endured forced marches to reach the theater and the battlefield. They were exhausted and low on water. The men had not had a hot meal in several days, having bivouacked the night before without fires.

Despite those arguments, Frederick wanted to press his initial success. He had won half the battle and wanted the whole victory. He decided to continue the fight. He transferred his artillery to the Mühlberg, and ordered Finck&#x27;s battalions to assault the Allied salient from the northwest, while his main strike force would cross the Kuhgrund.

To complete Frederick&#x27;s battle plan, the Prussians would have to descend from the Mühlberg to the lower Kuhgrund, cross the spongy field, and then assault the well-defended higher ground. This is where Saltykov had concentrated his men, making the Grosser Spitzberg nearly impregnable. At this point in his plan, Frederick intended to have the second half of a pincer movement ready to squeeze the Russian left. The rearmost forces were supposed to have advanced straight against the Russians from the south, while the right wing did the same from the north. The right was where it was supposed to be, with the exception of one of the support formations for the right wing, which was held up by misinformation about the ground: a couple of bridges that crossed the Huhner Fliess were too narrow for the artillery teams. The left was still out of position.

Anticipating Frederick&#x27;s plan, Saltykov had reinforced the salient with reserves from the west and southwest; these reserves included most of Laudon&#x27;s fresh infantry. Finck made no progress at the salient and the Prussian attack at the Kuhgrund was thwarted with murderous fire along their very narrow front. Watching from the luxury of the Kleiner Spitzberg immediately east of the village, Saltykov judiciously fed in reinforcements from other sectors, and awaited results. Once, in the fierce fighting, it looked like the Prussians might break through, but gradually the Allied superiority of 423 artillery pieces could be brought to bear on the struggling Prussians. The Allied grenadiers held their lines.

The Prussian left had been held up by a variety of problems, mostly relating to the inadequately-scouted terrain. Two small ponds and several streams trisected the ground between the Prussian front and the Russians, which the Russians had also littered with abatis. Tats required the Prussian line to break into small columns that could march along narrow passages between the water and marshy ground, diminishing the legendary firepower of the Prussian line of attack. Outside the shtetl, the Prussians tried to break through the Russian line; they got as far as the Jewish cemetery at the eastern base of Judenberg, but lost two thirds of Krockow&#x27;s 2nd Dragoons in the process: 484 men and 51 officers gone in minutes.

The 6th Dragoons lost another 234 men and 18 officers as well. Other regiments battling through the Russians and the terrain had comparable losses. Despite these problems, they continued to slog through the Russian positions, advancing toward the Kuhgrund outside what remained of Kunersdorf&#x27;s wall.

===Cavalry attack===
The battle culminated in the early evening hours with a Prussian cavalry charge, led by von Seydlitz, upon the Russian centre and artillery positions, a futile effort. The Prussian cavalry suffered heavy losses from cannon fire and retreated in complete disorder. Seydlitz himself was badly wounded and, in his absence, Generalleutnant Dubislav Friedrich von Platen assumed command. Under Frederick&#x27;s orders, Platen organized a last-ditch effort. His scouts had discovered a crossing past the chain of ponds south of Kunersdorf, but it lay in full view of the artillery batteries on the Grosser Spitzberge. Seydlitz, still following the action, noted that it was foolish to charge a fortified position with cavalry. His assessment was correct, but Frederick had apparently lost his ability to think objectively.

The strength of Frederick&#x27;s cavalry lay in its ability to attack at a full gallop, with riders knee to knee and horses touching at the shoulders. The units sent against the position shattered; they had to attack piecemeal because of the manner in which the ground was naturally formed. Before any further action could take place, Laudon himself led the Austrian cavalry&#x27;s counterattack around the obstacles and routed Platen&#x27;s cavalry. The fleeing men and horses trampled their own infantry around the base of the Mühlberge. General panic ensued.

The cavalry attack against fortified positions had failed. The Prussian infantry had been on its feet for 16 hours, half that in a forced march over muddy and uneven terrain, and the other half in slogging battle against formidable odds, in hot weather. Despite the apparent futility, the Prussian infantry repeatedly attacked the Spitzberge, each time with greater losses; the 37th Infantry lost 992 men and 16 officers, more than 90 percent of its force.

The King himself led two attacks of the 35th Infantry and lost two of his horses in the effort. He was mounting a third when the animal was shot in the neck and fell to the ground, nearly crushing the King. Two of Frederick&#x27;s adjutants pulled him from under the horse as it fell. A ball smashed the gold snuff box in his coat, and this box, plus his heavy coat, probably saved his life.

===Evening action===
By 5:00 pm, neither side could make any gains; the Prussians held tenaciously to the captured artillery works, too tired to even retreat: they had pushed the Russians from the Mühlberge, the village, and the Kuhgrund, but no further. The Allies were in a similar state, except they had more cavalry in reserve and some fresh Austrian infantry. This part of Laudon&#x27;s forces, late arrivals to the scene and largely unused, came into action at about 7:00 pm. To the exhausted Prussians holding the Kuhgrund, the swarm of fresh Austrian reserves was the final stroke. Although such isolated groups as Hans Sigismund von Lestwitz&#x27;s regiment put up a bold front, these groups lost heavily and their stubborn defense could not stop the chaos of the Prussian retreat. Soldiers threw their weapons and gear aside and ran for their lives.

The battle was lost for Frederick—it had actually been lost for the Prussians for a couple of hours—but he had not accepted this fact. Frederick rode among his melting army, snatched a regimental flag, trying to rally his men: &quot;Children, my children, come to me. Avec moi, Avec moi!&quot; They did not hear him, or if they did, they chose not to obey. Watching the chaos and seeking the &quot;coup de grâce,&quot; Saltykov threw his own Cossacks and Kalmyks (cavalry) into the fray. The Chuguevski Cossacks surrounded Frederick on a small hill, where he stood with the remnants of his body-guard—the Leib Cuirassiers—determined to either hold the line or to die trying. With a 100-strong hussar squadron, Rittmeister (cavalry captain) Joachim Bernhard von Prittwitz-Gaffron cut his way through the Cossacks and dragged the King to safety. Much of his squadron died in the effort. As the hussars escorted Frederick from the battlefield, he passed the bodies of his men, lying on their faces with their backs slashed open by Laudon&#x27;s cavalry. A dry thunderstorm created a surreal effect.

==Aftermath==
That evening back in Reitwein, Frederick sat in a peasant hut and wrote a despairing letter to his old tutor, Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein:
 This morning at 11 o&#x27;clock I have attacked the enemy. ... All my troops have worked wonders, but at a cost of innumerable losses. Our men got into confusion. I assembled them three times. In the end I was in danger of getting captured and had to retreat. My coat is perforated by bullets, two horses of mine have been shot dead. My misfortune is that I am still living ... Our defeat is very considerable: To me remains 3,000 men from an army of 48,000 men. At the moment in which I report all this, everyone is on the run; I am no more master of my troops. Thinking of the safety of anybody in Berlin is a good activity ... It is a cruel failure that I will not survive. The consequences of the battle will be worse than the battle itself. I do not have any more resources, and—frankly confessed—I believe that everything is lost. I will not survive the doom of my fatherland. Farewell forever!
Frederick also decided to turn over command of the army to Finck. He told this general he was sick. He named his brother as generalissimo and insisted his generals swear allegiance to his nephew, the 14-year-old Frederick William.

===Casualties===

Before the battle, both armies had been reinforced by smaller units; by the time of the battle, the Allied forces had about 60,000 men, with another 5,000 holding Frankfurt, and the Prussians had almost 50,000. The Russians and Austrians lost 16,332 men (3,486 killed), some 27 percent. Russian losses were 14,031 and Austrian losses 2,301. Sources differ on Prussian losses. Duffy maintains 6,000 killed and 13,000 wounded, a casualty rate of more than 37 percent. Another source gives 18,609. Gaston Bodart represents losses at 43 percent, and that 6,100 of the 20,700 casualties were deaths. Frank Szabo places Prussian losses at 21,000.
Following the battle, the victorious Cossack troops plundered corpses and slit the throats of the wounded; this no doubt contributed to the death rate.

The Prussians lost their entire horse artillery, an amalgam of cavalry and artillery in which the crews rode horses into battle, dragging their cannons behind them, one of Frederick&#x27;s notable inventions. The Prussians also lost 60 percent of their cavalry, killed or wounded, animals and men. The Prussians lost 172 of their own cannons plus the 105 they had captured from the Russians in the late morning on the Mühlberge. They also lost 27 flags and two standards.

Staff losses were significant. Frederick lost eight regimental colonels. Of his senior command, Seydlitz was wounded and had to relinquish command to Platen, nowhere near his equal in energy and nerve; Wedel was wounded so badly he never fought again; Georg Ludwig von Puttkamer, commander of the Puttkamer Hussars, lay among the dead. Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, later the inspector general and major general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, was wounded at the battle. Ewald Christian von Kleist, the famous poet of the Prussian army, was badly injured in the latter moments of the assault on the Walkeberge. By the time he was injured, Major Kleist was the highest-ranking officer in his regiment. Generalleutnant August Friedrich von Itzenplitz died of his wounds on 5 September, Prince Charles Anton August von Holstein-Beck on 12 September, and Finck&#x27;s brigade commander, Generalmajor George Ernst von Klitzing, on 28 October in Stettin. Prussia was at its last gasp and Frederick despaired of preserving much of his remaining kingdom for his heir.

===Impact on Russo-Austro alliance===
Although still wary of one another, the Russian and Austrian commanders were satisfied with the result of their cooperation. They had outfought Frederick&#x27;s army in a test of nerve, courage and military skills. Elizabeth of Russia promoted Saltykov to Generalfeldmarschall and awarded a special medal to everyone involved. She also sent a sword of honor to Laudon, but the price of the rout was high: 27 percent Austrian and Russian losses would not usually qualify as a victory. The storming of field works typically resulted in a disproportionate number of killed over wounded. The conclusion of the battle in hand-to-hand struggle also increased casualties on both sides. Finally, subsequent cavalry charges and the stampeding flight of men and horses had caused many more injuries.

Regardless of the losses, Saltykov and Laudon remained on the field with intact armies, and with extant communications between one another. The Prussian defeat remained without consequences when the victors did not capitalize on the opportunity to march against Berlin, but retired to Saxony instead. If Saltykov had sought the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; in the last hour of the battle, he did not follow through with it.

Within days, Frederick&#x27;s army had reconstituted itself. Approximately 26,000 men, most of the survivors, were scattered over the territory between Kunersdorf and Berlin. Four days after the battle, though, most of the men turned up at the headquarters on the Oder River or in Berlin, and Frederick&#x27;s army recovered to a strength of 32,000 men and 50 artillery pieces.

Elizabeth of Russia continued her policy of providing support to Austria, considering it vital to Russian interests, but with decreasing effectiveness. Distance constrained the Russian supply lines, and despite Austrian headquarters&#x27; agreement to supply the Russian troops through their own lines, Russian troops took little part in the remaining battles of 1759 and 1760. The Russian army did not fight another major battle until they stormed Kolberg in 1761, allowing the Prussians to focus on the Austrians. In 1762, the death of Elizabeth, and the ascension of her nephew, Peter, an admirer of Frederick&#x27;s, saved the Prussians when he immediately withdrew Russia from hostilities.

==Assessment==
Most military historians agree that Kunersdorf was Frederick&#x27;s greatest, and most catastrophic, loss. They generally attribute it to three major problems: his indifference to the Russian practices of the &quot;art of war&quot;, his lack of information about the terrain, and his inability to realize that the Russians had surmounted the obstacles of location. Frederick complicated his fate by violating every principle of war he had espoused in his own writing.

First, Frederick had assumed he could use his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his reconnaissance had been incomplete. The Russians had been there for two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick&#x27;s arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason for him not to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, perhaps, that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick&#x27;s troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.

Second, Frederick&#x27;s most egregious mistake was his refusal to consider the recommendations of his trusted staff. Brother Henry, a superb tactician and strategist in his own right, reasonably suggested halting the battle at mid-day, after the Prussians had secured the first height and Wunsch, the city. Wunsch could not move across the river; only one bridge remained, and Laudon&#x27;s cavalry guarded it fiercely. Regardless, from these vantage points, the Prussians would be unassailable, and eventually, the Austro-Russian force would have to withdraw. Furthermore, Henry argued, the troops were exhausted from several days of marching, the weather was appallingly hot, they did not have enough water, and they had not had a good meal in several days. Instead of holding his secure position, though, Frederick forced his tired troops to descend the hill, cross the low ground, and ascend the next hill, in the face of heavy fire. The Prussian cavalry effort initially drove back the Russian and Austrian squadrons, but the fierce cannon and musketry fire from the united Allied front inflicted staggering losses on Frederick&#x27;s much-vaunted horsemen. Furthermore, he committed perhaps the gravest of errors in sending his cavalry into battle piecemeal and against entrenched positions.

Third, he acted on the ground of his enemy&#x27;s choosing, not of his own, and on the basis of meager information and almost no understanding of the ground, he broke all the military tactical rules of his own devising. He had thrown his infantry into the teeth of gun fire; he compounded this folly by committing his cavalry piecemeal in pointless charges across soft, spongy ground that was divided by streams, requiring them to attack in long, drawn out lines, rather than &quot;en masse&quot;; of course, he could not send his cavalry &quot;en masse&quot; because several natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—made this impossible on some of the terrain.

The catastrophic loss was due to more than these three issues, though. Indeed, he violated his own rules of strategy and tactics because he faced an enemy he despised, and this brought out the worst of his generalship. In this way, the loss at Kunersdorf was similar to that of the Battle of Hochkirch. There, the British envoy traveling with the Prussian Army attributed Frederick&#x27;s loss to the contempt in which he held the Austrians and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with his imagination; certainly, this contempt for the Austrians and the Russians contributed to his loss at Kunersdorf as well. Yet, as Herbert Redman notes, &quot;... seldom in military history has a battle been so completely lost by an organized army in such a short space of time.&quot; The loss was not only due to Frederick&#x27;s unwillingness to accept that the Russians, whom he despised, and the Austrians, whom he despised only slightly less, had any military acumen. At Hochkirch, Frederick demonstrated good leadership by rallying his troops against the surprise attack; Prussian discipline and the bonds of regimental cohesion had prevailed. Importantly, the Prussian army at Kunersdorf was not the same army that had fought at Hochkirch, because it had already fought, and lost, there. Over the winter, Frederick had cobbled together a new army, but it was not as well-trained, well-disciplined, and well-drilled as his old one. He failed to accept this. Arguably Frederick&#x27;s worst defeat, at Kunersdorf, his army panicked and discipline disintegrated before his eyes, especially in the last hour of the battle. The few regiments that held together, such as that of Lestwitz, were the exception. Frederick had demanded more of his men than they could bear.

<text>The Battle of Maxen (20 November 1759) was a battle at Maxen, in the Electorate of Saxony during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War). It resulted in surrender of a Prussian corps.

The Prussian corps of 14,000 men, commanded by Friedrich August von Finck (one of Frederick the Great&#x27;s generals), was sent to threaten lines of communication between the Austrian army at Dresden and Bohemia. Field Marshal Count Daun attacked and defeated Finck&#x27;s isolated corps on 20 November 1759 with his army of 40,000 men. The next day (21 November) Finck decided to surrender.
==Background==
After the victories obtained in previous years, 1759 saw a succession of serious failures for the forces of the Kingdom of Prussia, engaged in a relentless struggle against a vast coalition of enemies including the Habsburg monarchy, the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of France, the Russian Empire and Sweden. Due to the wear and tear of his forces, King Frederick II of Prussia had had to renounce the strategy, by now becoming habitual, of anticipating the movements of his opponents by launching offensives in the direction of the territories occupied by the enemy to instead take a more defensive conduct, aimed at in particular to prevent the gathering into a single mass of the Austrian and Russian armies; the monarch&#x27;s action had not had a positive outcome: defeat of the Prussian army of General Carl Heinrich von Wedel in the Battle of Kay on 23 July 1759, the Russian forces of General Pyotr Saltykov had reunited with the Austrian units of Marshal Ernst Gideon von Laudon in Silesia and the following 12 August had inflicted a catastrophic defeat on Frederick II himself in the Battle of Kunersdorf.

The defeat at Kunersdorf left the Prussian army half-destroyed and the way to Berlin open, but the allies did not know how to take advantage of it: the Russians had suffered heavy losses and, after a series of unsuccessful maneuvers, Saltykov brought his forces back to the quarters set up in Poland leaving the Austrians of Laudon alone, who eventually also withdrew from Silesia. While the Austro-Russians faced Frederick in Silesia, a second Austrian army under the command of Marshal Leopold Josef Graf Daun had operated in the lands of the Electorate of Saxony, occupied by the Prussians since the start of the war, against the forces under the command of Prince Henry of Prussia; the Austrians had initially gained ground by even occupying the Saxon capital, Dresden, on 6 September, but on 25 September Prince Henry had obtained a victory against an Austrian detachment in the Battle of Hoyerswerda: with lines of communication with Bohemia threatened, Daun had to order a retreat to the south while continuing to maintain possession of Dresden.

Having confirmed that the Russians had withdrawn from Silesia, Frederick had returned the forces to his orders in Saxony in support of his brother with whom he was reunited on 13 November; the Saxon lands were an important source of supplies and recruits for the Prussians, and despite the advanced season Frederick decided to continue the war operations in order to drive Daun back to Bohemia and regain control of Dresden. To induce the Austrians to abandon the Saxon capital, on 15 November Frederick made the decision to detach the body of General Friedrich August von Finck from the main army, sending him to infiltrate the rear of Daun to threaten the lines of communication; the move, however, inevitably ended up isolating Finck&#x27;s troops within the much larger Austrian forces, inviting Daun to attack him.

==Battle==

On 19 November Finck&#x27;s forces amounted to about 14,000 men, had reached the village of Maxen, located in a small valley of the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge); The forces of Daun, on the other hand, had reached, protected by the fog, the town of Dippoldiswalde south-west of Maxen, with other Austrian troops under General Anton Joseph von Brentano-Cimaroli attested further north between Wittgendorf and Tronitz and some departments of the Imperial Reichsarmee guarding Dohna to the northeast. While Daun had his troops, numbering about 32,000 men, camp for the night, Finck stood in a defensive position in the hills around Maxen.

On the morning of 20 November, the Austrians from Daun set off from Dippoldiswalde divided into four columns heading towards Maxen, while the forces of Brentano also moved south to converge on the town; the ground, frozen and covered by a first splash of snow, made it difficult for the cavalry and artillery to move around. Daun&#x27;s vanguard encountered the first Prussian pickets near the village of Rheinhadrtsgrimma, who, at Finck&#x27;s instructions, withdrew from the village; the Austrian grenadiers then climbed the hills behind the town, allowing their artillery to take up a position to beat the left side of the Prussian line. Starting at 11:00 an intense cannonade developed on both sides for the next 45 minutes, until Daun ordered the advance to be resumed: five battalions of Austrian grenadiers led the attack on the hills in front of the towns of Wittgensdorf and Maxen, routing the Prussian battalions that held them and pushing up to enter Maxen itself. The entire left wing of the Prussians was therefore isolated from the right wing and had to turn north towards the village of Schmorsdorf.

Meanwhile, the Austrian body of Brentano had lined up to face the right wing of the Prussians, coming to envelop the enemy line; Finck tried to stop him by launching a formation of cuirassiers in a counterattack, but the Prussian cavalry ran into too difficult terrain and their charge was easily repelled by the Austrian infantry. Finck tried to rally his confused units near Schmorsdorf, while Daun reconnected with Brentano&#x27;s troops on the left; the Austrians then launched a general attack that routed the Prussian infantry, which left several flags and cannons in the hands of the enemy as well as many prisoners. The Prussian cavalry attempted to counterattack, but was in turn charged by a regiment of Austrian dragoons which routed it. Finck led what was left of his forces to rejoin the contingent of detached General Wunsch to face the Reichsarmee troops at Dohna; the Prussians were now completely surrounded, while the Austrians, firmly established on the hills they had conquered, received supplies and reinforcements of fresh troops during the night. Finck planned for the next day, 21 November, an attempt to break the encirclement by launching an attack from Schmorsdorf, but his infantry was now decimated, and finally the Prussian commander decided to request for a surrender to the Austrians while his cavalry, under the command of Wunsch, tried to escape from the battlefield by passing through the lines of the imperial troops. Daun accepted the Prussian surrender, but insisted that it also be extended to the cavalry of Wunsch which Finck claimed to be a separate corps from his command; informed that Wunsch had failed to find an escape route for his cuirassiers, Finck was eventually persuaded to sign the capitulation on behalf of his entire force.

==Consequences==
Finck&#x27;s entire Prussian force was lost in the battle, leaving 3,000 dead and wounded on the ground as well as 11,000 prisoners of war; the booty fallen into the hands of the Austrians also included 71 artillery pieces, 96 flags and 44 ammunition wagons. The success cost Daun&#x27;s forces only 934 casualties including dead and wounded. The defeat at Maxen was another blow to the decimated ranks of the Prussian army, and infuriated Frederick to such an extent that General Finck was court-martialed and sentenced to two years in prison after the war. However, Daun decided not to exploit the success in the slightest to attempt offensive maneuvers and retired to his winter quarters near Dresden, marking the conclusion of the war operations for 1759.

<text>The Battle of Meissen (4 December 1759) was an Austrian victory over a smaller Prussian force during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War). An Austrian force under the command of general Beck assaulted 3,500 Prussian troops under Diericke at Meissen, overwhelming them and driving the survivors across the Elbe. The Prussians lost 400 men in the action and 1,543 fell prisoner. Austrian losses were few, totalling only 72 killed and 115 wounded.

<text>The Battle of Warburg was fought on 31 July 1760 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The battle was a victory for the Hanoverians and the British against a slightly larger French army. The victory meant the Anglo-German allies had successfully defended Westphalia from the French by preventing a crossing of the Diemel River, but were forced to abandon the allied state of Hesse-Kassel to the south. The fortress of Kassel ultimately fell, and would remain in French hands until the final months of the war, when it was finally recaptured by the Anglo-German allies in late 1762.

The British general, John Manners, Marquess of Granby, became famous in the battle for charging at the head of the British cavalry and losing his hat and wig during the charge. The French lost 1500 men, killed and wounded, around 1,500 prisoners and ten pieces of artillery.

<text>In the Battle of Torgau on 3 November 1760, King Frederick the Great&#x27;s Prussian army fought an Austrian army under the command of Field Marshal Leopold Josef Graf Daun. The Prussians won a costly victory in one of the bloodiest battles of the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War).

==Background==

In August, Daun missed an opportunity to destroy the main Prussian army in Silesia. Outnumbered three-to-one, Frederick escaped the Austrian trap by smashing the corps of Feldzeugmeister Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon at the Battle of Liegnitz. When the Prussians lingered in Silesia, their more numerous enemies attacked. Feldzeugmeister Franz Moritz Graf von Lacy&#x27;s 18,000 Austrians joined with General Tottleben&#x27;s Russian force near Berlin, making a total of 35,000 allies. While 13,000 Prussians took refuge in the Spandau fortress, Lacy and Tottleben captured 3,000 Prussians in Berlin on 9 October.

==Plans==
In late October, Daun slipped out of Silesia and moved west to Saxony where Lacy joined him with his corps. When his government ordered him to stand and fight the Prussians, Daun selected a position on the Süptitzer Höhen (Heights) just west of Torgau.

The plateau had been used by Prince Henry of Prussia in 1759 and was protected on the west by abatis and on the south by a small stream. The Austrians faced south with Lacy&#x27;s corps nearest Torgau and Daun&#x27;s army further west. Altogether, Daun and Lacy marshalled 42,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry, and 275 cannons.

Frederick determined to send General Hans Joachim von Zieten to hold Daun&#x27;s attention from the south, while his main effort circled around the western end of the Austrian line to attack from the north.

Zieten&#x27;s corps comprised 21 infantry battalions and 54 cavalry squadrons, while Frederick&#x27;s main army deployed 41 battalions and 48 squadrons.

In total, the Prussians had 35,000 infantry, 13,500 cavalry, and 309 artillery pieces.

==Battle==


Noon found Frederick&#x27;s main army floundering in the woods to the north of Daun&#x27;s position. At this time, Zieten&#x27;s advance guard became embroiled with the Croatian light infantry belonging to Lacy&#x27;s corps. Daun alertly detected the Prussian maneuver and he shifted his first line to the north side of the heights. Soon an artillery duel erupted between Lacy and Zieten. Hearing the cannon fire and fearing that Zieten was being mauled, the Prussian king decided to launch his attack prematurely, with ten battalions of grenadiers. Concentrated Austrian cannon fire and musketry caused the loss of 5,000 Prussians in the span of one half-hour.

When the main body of infantry arrived on the scene, it was also sent into the uphill assault. Daun was forced to commit his reserves to defeat the second attack. The Prussian cavalry led by Prince Georg Ludwig of Holstein-Gottorp tried to break the Austrian line, but it also failed. A spent canister round hit Frederick in the chest and he withdrew to the village of Elsnig in considerable distress. The king spent the night sitting on the bottom step of the church altar waiting for news from the battlefield. Daun had been wounded in the foot and around sunset went to Torgau to have his wound dressed. The Austrian commander sent General Charles Flynn to deliver a preliminary victory dispatch to Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in Vienna.

The tide of the battle turned at dusk, when Zieten&#x27;s columns, who had been engaged pointlessly with Lacy, finally launched a major assault. Shifting his corps to the west, he found an unguarded causeway between two ponds and threw five battalions into the gap. Zieten followed up the initial breach with the balance of his infantry and soon his corps gained a foothold on the heights. Hearing Zieten&#x27;s battle, Lieutenant General J. D. von Hülsen led the survivors of the main army in a final attack. Taken from the north and south, the Austrian lines finally began to crumble.

Zieten&#x27;s men captured the Austrian gun battery and turned the cannons on their former owners, who twice tried unsuccessfully to regain the lost battery. By 9:00 p.m. the battle wound down with the Prussians still in control of the heights.

==Results==
The Prussians won the battle but at a heavy cost. They admitted losses of 16,670, while the Austrians lost 15,897, including some 10,000 men and 49 guns captured. One authority writes, Even after all this bloodletting the battle of Torgau decided little in strategic terms, for Daun still held Dresden and southern Saxony, while the troublesome Laudon was free to take up winter quarters in Silesia.

The battle left both sides exhausted. After losing as much if not more men than its enemy, Prussia was again severely weakened. However, without the prospect of a decisive victory against the Prussians, and with dwindling financial resources, Austria was also losing much of its offensive power. After the campaign of 1760, it had to reduce the size of its army, which left little hope of crushing Prussia without the help of Russia, which withdrew in 1762. For the Austrians, the battle was hence a severe psychological blow that decreased their hope of winning a decisive victory.

<text>The Battle of Burkersdorf took place on 21 July 1762 during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War). A Prussian army of 23,000 men fought an Austrian army of around 20,000 men.

After the death of Elizabeth of Russia, czarina of Russia, her nephew Peter III came to the throne. Peter was a great admirer of Frederick the Great and all things Prussian, and Frederick used this to his advantage. Peter promptly withdrew his army from the war, abandoned Russian-occupied East Prussia, and signed a treaty of peace with Frederick. Peter then sent a force to aid the Prussian army in the campaign against the Austrians.

Peter&#x27;s reign was short-lived, however, as his wife Catherine the Great seized the throne, and he died shortly afterwards. Catherine withdrew from the war and sent orders for Count Zakhar Tchernyshov aiding the Prussians to withdraw.

The Austrian army was not aware of the exit of the Russian forces until Frederick began the battle. 

Frederick attacked and won, and the Russian force returned home. Catherine&#x27;s attempts to resume the war against Prussia were in vain, as peace talks were already being initiated at Hubertsberg.

<doc id="446499" wikidata="Q1123260" url="?curid=446499" title="Palpitations">
<text>Palpitations occur when a person becomes aware of their heartbeat. The heartbeat may feel hard, fast, or uneven in their chest.

Symptoms include a very fast or irregular heartbeat. Palpitations are a sensory symptom. They are often described as a skipped beat, a rapid flutter, or a pounding in the chest or neck.

Palpitations are not always the result of a physical problem with the heart and can be linked to anxiety. However, they may signal a fast or irregular heartbeat. Palpitations can be brief or long-lasting. They can be intermittent or continuous. Other symptoms can include dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating, headaches, and chest pain.

There are a variety of causes of palpitations not limited to the following:

Palpitation may be associated with coronary heart disease, perimenopause, hyperthyroidism, adult heart muscle diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart diseases like atrial septal defects, diseases causing low blood oxygen such as asthma, emphysema or a blood clot in the lungs; previous chest surgery; kidney disease; blood loss and pain; anemia; drugs such as antidepressants, statins, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, cocaine and amphetamines; electrolyte imbalances of magnesium, potassium and calcium; and deficiencies of nutrients such as taurine, arginine, iron or vitamin B12.

The pathophysiology, evaluation, diagnoses, and treatments available for palpitations can vary and should be discussed with a medical professional. This article will explore the potential causes of palpitations, from benign triggers to more serious underlying cardiac conditions. This article will also discuss the key steps in evaluating palpitations, including history-taking, physical exams, and diagnostic tests, as well as the various treatment approaches based on the underlying causes.

==Signs and symptoms==


Three common descriptions of &quot;palpitation&quot; are:
*&quot;flip-flopping&quot; (or &quot;stop and start&quot;) is often caused by premature contraction of the atrium or ventricle. The pause after the contraction causes the &quot;stop.&quot; The &quot;start&quot; comes from the next forceful contraction.
*rapid &quot;fluttering in the chest&quot; suggests arrhythmias. Regular &quot;fluttering&quot; points to supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia. Irregular &quot;fluttering&quot; suggests atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or tachycardia with variable block.
*&quot;pounding in the neck&quot; or neck pulsations, often due to cannon A waves in the jugular vein. These occur when the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve.

Palpitations often come with other symptoms. Knowing these links can help us tell if they are dangerous or harmless. However, these links are not definitive. A licensed healthcare professional must evaluate you. This is to ensure an accurate diagnosis and proper care.

Palpitations associated with chest discomfort or chest pain suggests coronary artery disease. Palpitation associated with light-headedness, fainting or near fainting suggest low blood pressure and may signify a life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmia. Palpitation that occurs regularly with exertion suggests a rate-dependent bypass tract or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

If a benign cause for these symptoms isn&#x27;t found at the first visit, then prolonged heart monitoring at home or in the hospital setting may be needed. Noncardiac symptoms should also be elicited since the palpitations may be caused by a normal heart responding to a metabolic or inflammatory condition. Weight loss could suggest hyperthyroidism. Palpitation can be precipitated by vomiting or diarrhea that leads to electrolyte disorders and hypovolemia. Hyperventilation, hand tingling, and nervousness are common when anxiety or panic disorder is the cause of the palpitations.

==Causes==

The responsibility for the perception of heartbeat by neural pathways is not clear. It has been hypothesized that these pathways include different structures located both at the intra-cardiac and extra-cardiac level. Palpitations are a widely diffuse complaint and particularly in subjects affected by structural heart disease. The list of causes of palpitations is long, and in some cases, the etiology is unable to be determined. In one study reporting the etiology of palpitations, 43% were found to be cardiac, 31% psychiatric, and approximately 10% were classified as miscellaneous (medication induced, thyrotoxicosis, caffeine, cocaine, anemia, amphetamine, mastocytosis).

The cardiac etiologies of palpitations are the most life-threatening and include ventricular sources (premature ventricular contractions (PVC), ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), atrial sources (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter) high output states (anemia, AV fistula, Paget&#x27;s disease of bone or pregnancy), structural abnormalities (congenital heart disease, cardiomegaly, aortic aneurysm, or acute left ventricular failure), and miscellaneous sources (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome abbreviated as POTS, Brugada syndrome, and sinus tachycardia).

Palpitation can be attributed to one of five main causes:
# Extra-cardiac stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (inappropriate stimulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic, particularly the vagus nerve, (which innervates the heart), can be caused by anxiety and stress due to acute or chronic elevations in glucocorticoids and catecholamines. Gastrointestinal distress such as bloating or indigestion, along with muscular imbalances and poor posture, can also irritate the vagus nerve causing palpitations)
# Sympathetic overdrive (panic disorder, low blood sugar, hypoxia, antihistamines (levocetirizine), low red blood cell count, heart failure, mitral valve prolapse).
# Hyperdynamic circulation (valvular incompetence, thyrotoxicosis, hypercapnia, high body temperature, low red blood cell count, pregnancy).
# Abnormal heart rhythms (ectopic beat, premature atrial contraction, junctional escape beat, premature ventricular contraction, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, heart block).
# Pectus Excavatum, also known as funnel chest, is a chest wall deformity. When the breastbone (sternum) and attached ribs are sunken in enough to put excess pressure on the heart and lungs which can cause tachycardia and skipped beats.

Palpitations can occur during times of catecholamine excess, such as during exercise or at times of stress. The cause of the palpitations during these conditions is often a sustained supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Supraventricular tachycardias can also be induced at the termination of exercise when the withdrawal of catecholamines is coupled with a surge in the vagal tone. Palpitations secondary to catecholamine excess may also occur during emotionally startling experiences, especially in patients with a long QT syndrome.

===Psychiatric problems===

Anxiety and stress elevate the body&#x27;s level of cortisol and adrenaline, which in turn can interfere with the normal functioning of the parasympathetic nervous system resulting in overstimulation of the vagus nerve. Vagus nerve induced palpitation is felt as a thud, a hollow fluttery sensation, or a skipped beat, depending on at what point during the heart&#x27;s normal rhythm the vagus nerve fires. In many cases, the anxiety and panic of experiencing palpitations cause a patient to experience further anxiety and increased vagus nerve stimulation. The link between anxiety and palpitation may also explain why many panic attacks involve an impending sense of cardiac arrest. Similarly, physical and mental stress may contribute to the occurrence of palpitation, possibly due to the depletion of certain micronutrients involved in maintaining healthy psychological and physiological function. Gastrointestinal bloating, indigestion and hiccups have also been associated with overstimulation of the vagus nerve causing palpitations, due to branches of the vagus nerve innervating the GI tract, diaphragm, and lungs.

Many psychiatric conditions can result in palpitations including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and somatization. However one study noted that up to 67% of patients diagnosed with a mental health condition had an underlying arrhythmia. There are many metabolic conditions that can result in palpitations including, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypomagnesemia, and pheochromocytoma.

===Medication===

The medications most likely to result in palpitations include sympathomimetic agents, anticholinergic drugs, vasodilators and withdrawal from beta blockers.

Excessive consumption of caffeine, commonly found in coffee, tea, and energy drinks, is a well-known trigger. Recreational drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, and MDMA (Ecstasy) are also associated with palpitations and pose significant cardiovascular risks. These substances can lead to serious health issues, including vasospasm-related angina, heart attacks, and strokes. Understanding the impact of these substances is crucial for both prevention and management of palpitations.

==Pathophysiology==

The sensation of palpitations can arise from extra-systoles or tachyarrhythmia. It is very rarely noted due to bradycardia. Palpitations can be described in many ways. The most common descriptions include a flip-flopping in the chest, a rapid fluttering in the chest, or pounding in the neck. The description of the symptoms may provide a clue regarding the etiology of the palpitations, and the pathophysiology of each of these descriptions is thought to be different. In patients who describe the palpitations as a brief flip-flopping in the chest, the palpitations are thought to be caused by extra- systoles such as supraventricular or ventricular premature contractions. The flip-flop sensation is thought to result from the &quot;forceful&quot; contraction following the pause, and the sensation that the heart is stopped results from the pause. The sensation of rapid fluttering in the chest is thought to result from a sustained ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia. Furthermore, the sudden cessation of this arrhythmia can suggest paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. This is further supported if the patient can stop the palpitations by using Valsalva maneuvers. The rhythm of the palpitations may indicate the etiology of the palpitations (irregular palpitations indicate atrial fibrillation as a source of the palpitations). An irregular pounding sensation in the neck can be caused by the dissociation of mitral valve and tricuspid valve, and the subsequent atria are contracting against a closed tricuspid and mitral valves, thereby producing cannon A waves. Palpitations induced by exercise could be suggestive of cardiomyopathy, ischemia or channelopathies.

==Diagnosis==

To diagnose palpitations, patient description is of notable importance, and a complete history and physical exam are essential. Key details are the age symptoms began, the presence of other symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, or fainting and the situations in which they occur. It may also be helpful to know about their caffeine intake, if deep breathing or changing positions can stop the palpitations, or how the palpitations start and stop - do they begin and end suddenly or gradually, does the heartbeat feel regular or irregular, how fast does the pulse get during an episode, etc. It is useful to know whether the person has found a way to stop the palpitations (like resting or the Valsalva maneuver).

Along with medical and family history, the patient should be asked about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, their habits such as exercise, caffeine or alcohol and drug.

Diagnosing palpitations can be arduous as it is rare for symptoms to occur during a routine medical exam or an ECG. However, if a heart murmur or abnormal ECG is found, it can provide important clues, and as such a thorough physical exam and ECG are essential.
The physical exam should include checking vital signs and a position based blood pressure measurement, listening to the heart and lungs and examining the arms and legs. If the person is not displaying symptoms during the exam, they can tap out the rhythm to show what their heartbeat felt like.

Palpitations that start in childhood are often caused by supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Palpitations that appear later in life are more likely linked to structural heart problems. A rapid, regular heartbeat is usually due to paroxysmal SVT or ventricular tachycardia. A rapid, irregular rhythm might be due to atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or tachycardia with a variable block. Supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias often cause sudden palpitations, beginning and ending rapidly. If someone can stop their palpitations with the Valsalva maneuver, it may indicate SVT. Palpitations with chest pain could mean reduced blood flow to the heart. If the person feels lightheaded or faints, arrhythmias should be considered.

Positive orthostatic vital signs may indicate dehydration or an electrolyte abnormality. A mid-systolic click and heart murmur may indicate mitral valve prolapse. A harsh holo-systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border which increases with Valsalva may indicate hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. An irregular rhythm indicates atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Evidence of cardiomegaly and peripheral edema may indicate heart failure and ischemia or a valvular abnormality.

===Evaluation===

Most patients who experience palpitations have harmless underlying causes. The main purpose of further testing is to identify individuals with higher risk of serious arrhythmia. 

A 12-lead electrocardiogram must be performed on every patient complaining of palpitations. The presence of a short PR interval and a delta wave (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) is an indication of the existence of ventricular pre-excitation. Significant left ventricular hypertrophy with deep septal Q waves in I, L, and V4 through V6 may indicate hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The presence of Q waves may indicate a prior myocardial infarction as the etiology of the palpitations, and a prolonged QT interval may indicate the presence of the long QT syndrome.

Laboratory studies should be limited initially. A complete blood count can assess for anemia and infection. Serum urea, creatinine and electrolytes assess for electrolyte imbalances and renal dysfunction. Thyroid function tests may reveal hyperthyroidism.

Further diagnostic testing is recommended for those in whom the initial diagnostic evaluation (history, physical examination, and EKG) suggest an arrhythmia, those who are at high risk for an arrhythmia, and those who remain anxious to have a specific explanation of their symptoms. People considered to be at high risk for an arrhythmia include those with organic heart disease or any myocardial abnormality that may lead to serious arrhythmias. These conditions include a scar from myocardial infarction, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, clinically significant valvular regurgitant, or stenotic lesions and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies.

An aggressive diagnostic approach is recommended for those at high risk and can include ambulatory monitoring or electrophysiologic studies. There are three types of ambulatory EKG monitoring devices: Holter monitors, continuous-loop event recorders, and an implantable loop recorders. Patients should be made aware of the properties of the device and the accompanying course of examination. The Holter monitor is a 24-hour monitoring system that is worn by exam takers themselves and records and continuously saves data. Holter monitors are typically worn for a few days. The continuous-loop event recorders are also worn by the exam taker and continuously record data, but the data is saved only when someone manually activates the monitor. The continuous-loop recorders can be long worn for longer periods of time than the Holter monitors and therefore have been proven to be more cost-effective and efficacious than Holter monitors. Also, because the person triggers the device when he/she feel the symptoms, they are more likely to record data during palpitations. An implantable loop recorder is a device that is placed subcutaneously and continuously monitors for cardiac arrhythmias. These are most often used in those with unexplained syncope and can be used for longer periods of time than the continuous loop event recorders. An implantable loop recorder is a device that is placed subcutaneously and continuously monitors for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias. These are most often used in those with unexplained syncope and are a used for longer periods of time than the continuous loop event recorders. Electrophysiology testing enables a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanism of the cardiac arrhythmia as well as the site of origin. EPS studies are usually indicated in those with a high pretest likelihood of a serious arrhythmia. The level of evidence for evaluation techniques is based upon consensus expert opinion.

Most people with palpitations display normal heart structure, but valvular defects are possible. In these cases, a doctor may hear a murmur and perform an echocardiogram.

==Treatment==

=== Non-medical treatments ===
To manage palpitations effectively, incorporating stress and anxiety-reducing techniques, like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga, can help alleviate symptoms by promoting relaxation and reducing the body&#x27;s stress response. For immediate relief during an episode of palpitations, vagal maneuvers are often use preliminarily in the hospital setting. These maneuvers involves holding one&#x27;s breath and bearing down—can be employed to stimulate the vagus nerve and slow the heart rate. However, these techniques may provide only temporary relief, and if palpitations persist or are associated with other concerning symptoms, medical evaluation is essential to determine any underlying causes and appropriate treatment options. 

While lifestyle modifications can be beneficial, they may not fully address palpitations resulting from ongoing medical conditions, necessitating further medical intervention.

=== Medical treatments ===
Treating palpitations depends on how bad they are and what’s causing them.

Radiofrequency ablation is a common treatment for most supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. Another option is stereotactic radioablation. It was originally performed for tumors. But, it has also treated tough heart rhythm problems. These include ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.

Some palpitations are caused by extra heartbeats or occur with a normal heart rhythm. These include beats that start above the ventricles or ventricular ectopic beats. These are usually harmless, and patients can be reassured that they’re not dangerous. If the symptoms are bothersome or impact daily life, beta-blockers might help. They can also protect healthy people.

People with no symptoms, normal lab tests, and normal EKG results can usually leave the emergency department safely. They should follow up with their primary care doctor or a cardiologist. However, patients with palpitations linked to fainting (syncope), uncontrolled arrhythmias, poor blood flow (hemodynamic issues), or chest pain (angina) should get further evaluation.

If palpitations are due to heart muscle problems, a cardiologist must be involved in the patient&#x27;s care.

Palpitations from vagus nerve stimulation are usually not due to heart problems. These types of palpitations originate outside the heart and are not a sign of an unhealthy heart muscle. To treat this type of palpitation, the cause of irritation to the vagus nerve or parasympathetic nervous system needs to be found and fixed. Anxiety and stress can worsen vagus nerve-induced palpitations. So, managing stress is key to treatment.

==Prognosis==
Heart rate monitoring with smartphones and smartwatches is now common. These devices are quite good at finding heart problems such as arrhythmias. They are now used to help diagnose, monitor, and treat various heart conditions. Formal research has found that current smartwatch apps can detect abnormal heart rhythms, like atrial fibrillation and alert people to this. These apps can also detect changes in heart rhythm, like the QT interval, correctly identify these changes in about in a significant majority of people who have them.

These devices are continuing to improve. They seem to be the future of monitoring heart health and catching problems early. Future care could use heart data from mobile devices to ensure timely access to medical care. Additionally, monitoring heart conditions could help assess how well treatments work.

Many people worry when they feel palpitations. However, in most cases, the cause of palpitations is harmless, so detailed medical tests are often not needed. Following up with a primary care doctor can help track symptoms and decide if a heart specialist (cardiologist) is needed.

If someone is at high risk of having a serious heart problem, they may need more testing and treatment. Once the cause of palpitations is found, effective treatments exist. They are backed by good medical research. Working closely with patients to make treatment decisions and involving a healthcare team including nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and doctors can help ensure the best care and follow-up.

==Prevalence==

Palpitations are common in the general population. They are more so in those with structural heart disease. There are four types of sensations: Extra-systolic (premature heartbeats), Tachycardic (rapid heart rate), Anxiety-related or Intense palpitations. Anxiety-related palpitations are the most common. They often happen due to stress or psychological factors. We must evaluate patients to tell apart harmless causes from serious heart issues. Providers can choose the right tests and treatments by knowing these categories.

<doc id="446514" wikidata="Q7085573" url="?curid=446514" title="Oldest Member (character)">
<text>The Oldest Member (of a golf club with varying names) is a fictional character from the short stories and novels of P. G. Wodehouse. He narrates the majority of Wodehouse&#x27;s golf stories from the terrace of a golf club whose location is unclear. The location and name of the club change between the stories, and between the US and UK versions of some of the stories.

The club&#x27;s members enjoy having drinks in the clubhouse after a brisk eighteen holes; but they do so fully aware of the risk that the Oldest Member who, (though he has long since given up golf) has seen all and knows all, might pick up on their conversation and begin to relate a story from his experience. These stories are often told to another character, a &#x27;young man&#x27; who is eager to leave before the story has even started, and who occasionally fall asleep before or after the story has started. Once he has started talking, he cannot be stopped, and frequently grabs the arms and clothing of his unwilling audience to keep them in their seats.

Isaac Asimov used a similar format for his &quot;Union Club Mysteries&quot;.

==Inspiration==
One of the club&#x27;s names, Manhooset, may be a reference to Manhasset Bay in Long Island, New York. According to Wodehouse scholar N. T. P. Murphy, Wodehouse played golf at the Sound View Golf Club, which used to exist in Long Island, New York, and used it as the basis for the Oldest Member&#x27;s club. Sound View is referenced in the Wodehouse&#x27;s 1966 short story &quot;Life with Freddie&quot;. Wodehouse also played at the Walton Heath and Addington courses in the UK. Addington is mentioned in Wodehouse&#x27;s preface to &quot;The Heart of a Goof&quot;.

==Fictional biography==

The Oldest Member is not named in the stories. He has white hair, white eyebrows and white whiskers, and is a bachelor. He appears to be in his seventies or older, since in &quot;The Letter of the Law&quot;, he says he went to Oxford with his friend Joseph Poskitt, one of the Wrecking Crew, who are all described as septuagenarians in &quot;Scratch Man&quot;. However, the Oldest Member says he attended Cambridge in &quot;The Heel of Achilles&quot;. In that story, the Oldest Member tells of a time when he was a young man shortly after finishing his college education. At that time, he worked as the secretary and caddie of American millionaire Vincent Jopp in Chicago.

The Oldest Member&#x27;s fictional golf club is given various names, including Wood Hills, Woodhaven, Marvis Bay, and Manhooset. The location of his club varies between England and the United States. For example, in &quot;A Woman is Only a Woman&quot;, the club is in England and called the Woodhaven Golf Club in the UK version, while it is in the US and called the Manhooset Golf Club in the US version. It is called the Marvis Bay Golf and Country Club in the UK version of &quot;Ordeal by Golf&quot;, though it is not located in Marvis Bay in the UK version of another story, &quot;The Heart of a Goof&quot;. Fictional golf clubs other than the Oldest Member&#x27;s are mentioned, including Goldenville (in &quot;High Stakes&quot;), Squashy Hollow (in &quot;Sleepy Time&quot; and other stories), and Wissahicky Glen, the club to which the Oldest Member belonged when he lived in Chicago in &quot;The Heel of Achilles&quot;.

He usually tells his stories from his favourite chair on the terrace overlooking the ninth green, and insists on using this chair in &quot;The Purification of Rodney Spelvin&quot;. In &quot;Sundered Hearts&quot;, which the Oldest Member narrates on a winter evening, he has a good view of the ninth green from inside the clubhouse in the smoking-room. The Oldest Member plays a role in several stories, usually because a fellow golfer came to him for advice. The Oldest Member does not hesitate to offer helpful advice, though his suggestions sometimes have mixed results, such as in &quot;The Salvation of George Mackintosh&quot;. In &quot;Tangled Hearts&quot;, when discussing Smallwood Bessemer, who annoyed people by giving too much advice, the Oldest Member says to a friend, &quot;I always advise people never to give advice.&quot;

In the story &quot;Ordeal by Golf&quot;, it is stated that he enjoys telling stories about golf and watching matches, though he himself has not played golf &quot;since the rubber-cored ball superseded the old dignified gutty&quot;. He teaches Mortimer Sturgis how to play golf in &quot;A Mixed Threesome&quot; and plays the game himself during the events of &quot;The Salvation of George Mackintosh&quot;. Revering golf above all other games, he is shocked when golfer Ambrose Gussett sinks to the level of playing tennis in &quot;Up from the Depths&quot;. In &quot;The Awakening of Rollo Podmarsh&quot;, it is mentioned that he had opposed the addition of tennis courts to the club grounds and now disapproves of a new bowling green. The Oldest Member is often asked to judge matches and act as a referee, as in the story &quot;Scratch Man&quot; when he referees the club championship final. He sometimes reads golf books, such as &quot;Vardon on Casual Water&quot; and &quot;Wodehouse on the Niblick&quot;.

It is assumed in multiple Wodehouse reference works that there is only one character referred to as the Oldest Member. However, because of the discrepancies between the stories, J. H. C. Morris suggested in his book &quot;Thank You, Wodehouse&quot; that there are at least three characters with that title: one who attended Oxford, another who went to Cambridge (and one of these resides at Marvis Bay while the other does not), and an American one. Morris also considered the possibility that the Oldest Member is Mr. Mulliner, but dismissed this idea for multiple reasons: Mr Mulliner is rarely directly involved in his stories while the Oldest Member is more frequently part of his own stories, Mr Mulliner appears to rely on cues more than the Oldest Member does, and Mulliner&#x27;s stories are more incredible than those of the Oldest Member.

== Stories ==
The Oldest Member narrates twenty-seven short stories:
* Nine of the ten stories in &quot;The Clicking of Cuthbert&quot; (1922):
** &quot;The Clicking of Cuthbert&quot;
** &quot;A Woman is Only a Woman&quot;
** &quot;A Mixed Threesome&quot;
** &quot;Sundered Hearts&quot;
** &quot;The Salvation of George Mackintosh&quot;
** &quot;Ordeal by Golf&quot;
** &quot;The Long Hole&quot;
** &quot;The Heel of Achilles&quot;
** &quot;The Rough Stuff&quot;
* All nine stories in &quot;The Heart of a Goof&quot; (1926):
** &quot;The Heart of a Goof&quot;
** &quot;High Stakes&quot;
** &quot;Keeping in with Vosper&quot;
** &quot;Chester Forgets Himself&quot;
** &quot;The Magic Plus Fours&quot;
** &quot;The Awakening of Rollo Podmarsh&quot;
** &quot;Rodney Fails to Qualify&quot;
** &quot;Jane Gets off the Fairway&quot;
** &quot;The Purification of Rodney Spelvin&quot;
* Three stories from &quot;Lord Emsworth and Others&quot; (1937):
** &quot;The Letter of the Law&quot;
** &quot;Farewell to Legs&quot;

** &quot;Up from the Depths&quot;
** &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;
** &quot;Excelsior&quot;
** &quot;Rodney Has a Relapse&quot;
** &quot;Tangled Hearts&quot;
* A single story from &quot;A Few Quick Ones&quot; (1959):
** &quot;Scratch Man&quot;
** Also includes &quot;Joy Bells for Walter&quot;, a reworking of &quot;Excelsior&quot;

Wodehouse also wrote other golf stories that are not narrated by the Oldest Member:
* &quot;Archibald&#x27;s Benefit&quot; (in &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot;)
* &quot;The Coming of Gowf&quot; (in &quot;The Clicking of Cuthbert&quot;)
* &quot;Those in Peril on the Tee&quot; (in &quot;Mr Mulliner Speaking&quot;)
* &quot;Sleepy Time&quot; (in &quot;Plum Pie&quot;)
* Novels prominently featuring golf include &quot;Uneasy Money&quot; (1916), &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; (1919), and &quot;Doctor Sally&quot; (1932)

==Adaptations==
The Oldest Member appeared in one of the short films in the 1924 &quot;The Clicking of Cuthbert&quot; film series. In the short film, titled &quot;The Clicking of Cuthbert&quot;, he was portrayed by E. Ashley Marvin. The other five short films in the series were also based on golf stories by Wodehouse.

William Mervyn portrayed the Oldest Member in an episode of the television series &quot;Wodehouse Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Rodney Fails to Qualify&quot;, which first aired in May 1975. The series also includes episodes based on &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; and &quot;Tangled Hearts&quot;.

The 1991 Swedish film &quot;Den ofrivillige golfaren&quot; was inspired by Wodehouse&#x27;s golf stories.

Maurice Denham starred as the Oldest Member in a series of radio adaptations of the golf stories. The series, titled &quot;The Oldest Member&quot;, aired on BBC Radio 4 between 1994 and 1999. The club is called the Prior&#x27;s Heath Golf Club in the radio series.

The romantic comedy play &quot;Love on the Links&quot; was adapted from Wodehouse&#x27;s golf stories. It premiered at the Salisbury Playhouse on 31 May 2018, and starred Michael Fenton Stevens as the Oldest Member. In the play, the Oldest Member&#x27;s club is called the Wood Hills Golf Club.

<text>Bo Derek (born Mary Cathleen Collins; November 20, 1956) is an American actress and model. She began her career as a child model before deciding to pursue acting on the advice of a talent agent she met through actress Ann-Margret, who was acquainted with her parents. In 1972, she was cast in the romantic drama film &quot;Once Upon a Love&quot; (1973), which was directed by her first husband John Derek and eventually released as &quot;Fantasies&quot; in 1981. Her breakthrough performance came in the romantic comedy film &quot;10&quot; (1979), which cemented her status as a sex icon and mainstream celebrity. The role earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for New Star of the Year – Actress.

Derek went on to star in three more films directed by John Derek: &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; (1981), &quot;Bolero&quot; (1984), and &quot;Ghosts Can&#x27;t Do It&quot; (1989), all of which were critically panned. Her other credits include the dramatic-comedy film &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; (1980), the American buddy comedy film &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; (1995), and the American telenovela series &quot;Fashion House&quot; (2006).
Derek has been involved in a number of philanthropic endeavors. For several years, she served as Honorary Chairperson for Veterans Affairs&#x27; National Rehabilitation Special Events, which helps disabled veterans overcome their limitations through sports and competition. In 2002, she was appointed to the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees by former President George W. Bush. A longtime WildAid ambassador, Derek was named Special Envoy of the Secretary of State for Wildlife Tracking Issues by former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick in 2006. In 2008, she was appointed a commissioner of the California Horse Racing Board by former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in honor of her many contributions to the betterment of horses, including her position as a spokesperson for the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act, which she had held since 2003. She was reappointed to the California Horse Racing Board in 2010 and 2014. 

Widowed in 1998, Derek began a relationship with actor John Corbett in 2002. They were married in December 2020.

== Early life ==
Derek was born Mary Cathleen Collins in Long Beach, California. Her father, Paul Collins, was a Hobie Cat executive, and her mother Norma (née White) was a make-up artist and hairdresser to Ann-Margret. Collins&#x27; parents divorced, and her mother married stunt performer Bobby Bass. She grew up with two sisters and a brother. 

Collins attended Narbonne High School in Harbor City, California. She remarked in a 1985 interview on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;:

== Career ==
=== Acting ===
While attending Narbonne High School at age 16 in 1972, Collins auditioned for the female lead in John Derek&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Love&quot;, a low-budget romantic drama film set in Greece. Although Derek had been considering Collins for the part, he felt that her naturally blonde hair was ill-suited to the character, whom he perceived as a brunette. He nevertheless offered Collins the role
on condition that she dye her hair darker, which Collins accepted. During post-production in Munich, the film ran out of funding and was seized by a German film lab. It remained in a vault for several years until being sold to producer Kevin Casselman. Casselman&#x27;s attempts to distribute the film globally prompted Derek and Collins to seek a restraining order against its release. They eventually dropped any legal action, deciding it was not worth their time and effort. The film was finally released in 1981 under the new title &quot;Fantasies&quot;, at which point it received negative reviews. 

During the course of these events, Collins became sexually involved with John Derek, who was 30 years her senior and still married to actress Linda Evans. Upon his divorce from Evans, Derek moved to Germany with Collins, where he would not face prosecution under California&#x27;s statutory rape laws because Collins was under the age of consent.

In 1976, at age 19, Collins married John Derek. From then on, she was known professionally as Bo Derek: an amalgam of her former stage name Bo Shane and married name Derek.

In 1977, director Michael Anderson cast Derek in a small role in his horror film &quot;Orca: The Killer Whale&quot;, in which Derek&#x27;s character has her leg bitten off by the title character.

In 1979, Derek was selected over Melanie Griffith, Heather Thomas, Tanya Roberts, and several others for the role of Jenny Hanley in the romantic comedy film &quot;10&quot;. Directed by Blake Edwards, the film starred Dudley Moore as a middle-aged man who finds Derek&#x27;s character to be the ideal woman, i.e., a perfect 10. Derek&#x27;s appearance in a dream sequence, running towards Moore in a tight-fitting, nude-colored one-piece swimsuit, launched her status as a mainstream sex symbol. Distinguished by Derek&#x27;s cornrow hairstyle, the sequence has often been parodied. &quot;10&quot; was a critical and financial success. For her performance in the film, Derek received a Golden Globe Award nomination for New Star of the Year – Actress but ended up losing to Bette Midler for her performance in &quot;The Rose&quot;.

After &quot;10,&quot; Derek was cast in Richard Lang&#x27;s &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; (1980), a dramatic-comedy film that also featured Shirley MacLaine and Anthony Hopkins. Derek played a college student who has an affair with her older, married professor. &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; was only a moderate box-office success, with critics reviewing it and Derek&#x27;s performance unfavorably (&quot;The only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine&#x27;s&quot;).

In 1981, Derek starred in MGM&#x27;s R-rated &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot;, her first leading role in a mainstream Hollywood film. Directed by John Derek, the film dealt little with Tarzan and instead focused on Derek&#x27;s character, Jane Parker, and specifically on Derek&#x27;s physical attributes. Derek appears nude in two scenes, one of which involved her being bathed and body-painted. Ahead of &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot;&#x27;s release, MGM and the film&#x27;s distributor, United Artists, were sued for an injunction by the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate, which alleged that the film exceeded the scope of a 1931 license agreement (&quot;1931 Agreement&quot;) that permitted MGM to use Tarzan and other Burroughs characters in the 1932 film &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot;. The agreement stipulated that MGM could only produce remakes if the story of the 1932 film was maintained. Additionally, the Burroughs estate contended that MGM&#x27;s character license under the deal was terminated in 1977, thereby constituting a violation of their copyright. Upon reviewing the evidence, the Federal District Court in New York determined that &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; and its 1932 predecessor are &quot;based on substantially the same story&quot; when reduced to their major incidents, provided that modifications were made to tone down Derek&#x27;s nude scenes. It was further concluded that MGM&#x27;s character license had not been revoked due to the non-fulfillment of the legal prerequisites required for contract termination. Accordingly, the court ruled against the Burroughs estate and dismissed their injunction request. Although &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; received negative reviews, the film became a box-office success, making over $35 million in ticket sales and becoming the 15th highest-grossing film of 1981. For her performance as Jane Parker, Derek shared the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress with Faye Dunaway, the latter for her starring role as Joan Crawford in &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;.

Derek next appeared in the erotic comedy-drama film &quot;Bolero&quot; (1984). Directed again by John Derek, &quot;Bolero&quot; explores the female protagonist&#x27;s sexual awakening and her journey around the world to find an ideal first lover to take her virginity. Its sexual nature and substantial use of nudity earned the film an X rating, which is traditionally reserved for pornographic or extremely violent horror films. Critical reviews for &quot;Bolero&quot;, including Derek&#x27;s performance, were negative (&quot;[Bo Derek] would be a lot more appealing if she tried less assiduously to please&quot;). For her performance in the film, Derek won her second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. The film also won five additional Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Director (John Derek), Worst Screenplay (John Derek), Worst New Star (Olivia d&#x27;Abo), and Worst Musical Score (Peter Bernstein and Elmer Bernstein).

In 1987, Derek teamed up with Steven Paul of the firm sales agency Paul Entertainment to sell the unreleased feature film &quot;A Knight of Love&quot;, in which she was set to star, but the project never materialized.

After a five-year hiatus, Derek returned to feature films with the fantasy comedy-drama &quot;Ghosts Can&#x27;t Do It&quot; (1989). The final collaboration of Derek with her husband as director, &quot;Ghosts Can&#x27;t Do It&quot; was a failure both critically and financially. Earning Derek her third Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress, the film also won three additional Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture, Worst Director (John Derek), and Worst Supporting Actor (Donald Trump).

Following &quot;Ghosts Can&#x27;t Do It&quot;, Derek appeared in the television films &quot;Hot Chocolate&quot; (1992) and &quot;Shattered Image&quot; (1994) and the straight-to-video film &quot;Woman of Desire&quot; (1994). For her performance in the 1995 buddy comedy film &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;, Derek was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress but ultimately lost to Madonna for her performance in &quot;Four Rooms&quot;.

In 1998, Derek guest-starred on four episodes of the television series &quot;Wind on Water&quot;. In 1999, she appeared on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;.

At the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards in 2000, Derek was nominated for Worst Actress of the Century, sharing the nomination with Madonna (the eventual winner), Brooke Shields, Elizabeth Berkley, and Pia Zadora.

Derek appeared in several more feature films during the early 2000s, including &quot;Frozen with Fear&quot; (2000), &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; (2002), for which she received her second Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress, and &quot;Malibu&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2003). She also had guest roles on the television shows &quot;Family Law&quot;, &quot;Queen of Swords&quot;, &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;Still Standing&quot;, and &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

In 2006, Derek starred in 40 episodes of the 65-episode telenovela series &quot;Fashion House&quot;. In 2012, she appeared on &quot;&quot;.

Derek had a featured role in the 2015 made-for-TV campy horror film &quot;Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!&quot;

==Politics==
Derek, who describes herself as an independent, supported the presidential campaigns of Bob Dole, George H. W. Bush, and his son, George W. Bush. She attended the Republican National Convention in 2000 and 2004. Derek has also appeared at public events with former Republican Congressman David Dreier, whom she briefly dated following the death of her first husband.

In 2002, Derek was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, on the Operations Committee, by former President George W. Bush. When White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten was asked about his relationship with Derek on the April 30, 2006 edition of &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; with Chris Wallace, Bolten said she was a friend and a &quot;good supporter of the president.&quot;

Derek voted for Barack Obama in 2008.

In 2012, Derek endorsed Mitt Romney for president.

In a 2020 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, when asked who she was supporting in the then-upcoming presidential election, Derek explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t talk about who I vote for anymore. I supported Bush 43 and I became one of the poster girls for the Republicans. But I&#x27;m an independent. I don&#x27;t want to be pigeonholed and labeled as one thing or another.&quot; Responding to a related query about Donald Trump&#x27;s cameo in the 1989 film &quot;Ghosts Can&#x27;t Do It&quot;, Derek said that the part was written specifically for him and that &quot;he was great.&quot;

==Other work==
In 1980, Derek appeared twice in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine; she was featured again in 1981, 1984, and 1994.

Derek was set to participate in the 2016 Comedy Central roast of Rob Lowe, but she was unable to attend due to a scheduling conflict.

== Personal life ==
=== Horse owner and activist ===
Derek, a horse lover and riding enthusiast since childhood, owns Andalusian and Lusitano horses and is a spokesperson for the Animal Welfare Institute&#x27;s campaign to end horse slaughter through the passage of federal and state legislation. On February 5, 2002, she published her autobiography entitled &quot;Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses&quot; (). In 2008, Derek was appointed a commissioner of the California Horse Racing Board by former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a position she held until 2015. 
=== Wounded veterans advocate ===
Derek has served as Honorary Chairperson for Veterans Affairs&#x27; National Rehabilitation Special Events since 2000 or 2001. She is an avid supporter of the National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic in Snowmass Village, Colorado.

In 2003, Derek received the VA&#x27;s highest honor from Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony Principi. She regularly appears on United Service Organizations tours, for which the Special Forces Association named her an honorary Green Beret.

Derek&#x27;s father, Paul Collins, was a radio operator during the Korean War. Her stepfather, Bobby Bass, and her late husband, John Derek, were both US military veterans.

===Wildlife preservation===
Derek has been active for over 15 years with the environmental agency WildAid, which provides funds to protect sharks and dissuade people from purchasing wildlife products. In 2006, she was designated as the Special Envoy of the Secretary of State for Wildlife Tracking Issues by former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick. On August 13, 2020, she was a guest on the Discovery Channel&#x27;s Shark Week.

=== Relationships ===

After 16-year-old Mary Cathleen Collins began a relationship with John Derek, they moved to Germany, where Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California&#x27;s statutory rape laws. They returned to the United States soon after Collins&#x27; 18th birthday and were married in 1976. They remained married until Derek&#x27;s death from heart failure in 1998.

Following her husband&#x27;s death, Collins, who was now known as Bo Derek, briefly dated former Republican Congressman David Dreier.

<doc id="446521" wikidata="Q334020" url="?curid=446521" title="Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury">
<text>Hardinge Stanley Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury, PC (3 September 1823 – 11 December 1921) was a British barrister and Conservative politician. He served three times as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, for a total of seventeen years, a record not equaled by anyone except Lords Hardwicke and Eldon.

The son of a newspaper editor, Giffard was called to the English bar in 1850 and acquired a large criminal practice, defending the likes of Governor Eyre and Arthur Orton, the Tichborne claimant. He was chosen as solicitor-general by Disraeli in 1874, despite not securing a seat in the House of Commons until three years later. In 1885, he was appointed to the lord chancellorship by Lord Salisbury, and was created Baron Halsbury, serving until the following year. He then held the lord chancellorship again from 1886 until 1892, and from 1895 until 1905, when he resigned, aged 86. In 1898, he was further honoured with an earldom and a viscounty, becoming the Earl of Halsbury.

After relinquishing the lord chancellorship, Halsbury continued to sit as a law lord, delivering a judgement aged 93 in 1916. During the constitutional crisis over the Parliament Act 1911, Halsbury was one of the principal leaders of the rebel faction of Tory peers—labelled the &quot;Ditchers&quot;—that resolved on all out opposition to the government&#x27;s bill limiting the House of Lords&#x27; veto whatever happened. He was also the first editor of the legal encyclopaedia which today bears his name, &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England&quot;.

During his tenure on the woolsack, Halsbury was accused of favouring conservative lawyers for judicial appointments, although the consideration of political allegiances for judicial appointments was a common practice at the time, and later commentators have blamed bad luck for the failure of several of the judges he appointed. He was also accused of allowing political considerations affect his decisions as a judge, in particularly as they related to trade unions. He was, however, sympathetic to working men seeking workmen&#x27;s compensation. In the realm of legal reform, he was responsible for enacting the Land Transfer Act of 1897 and the Criminal Evidence Act of 1898.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Pentonville, London, Giffard was the third son of Stanley Lees Giffard, editor of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, by his wife Susanna, daughter of Francis Moran, Downhill, Ballina, County Mayo. Hardinge attended Merton College, Oxford. His mother died when he was five, and his father married his cousin, Mary Anne Giffard. He was educated by his father at home, before entering Merton College, Oxford, where he obtained a fourth-class degree in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; in 1845. Between 1845 and 1848, he helped his father edit the &quot;Standard&quot;.

Having entered the Inner Temple as a student in 1848, he was called to the bar there in 1850. Giffard joined the Westen, then the South Wales circuits. Afterwards he had a large practice at the Central Criminal Court and the Middlesex sessions, and he was for several years junior prosecuting counsel to the Treasury, and working treasurer in 1881. He was engaged in most of the celebrated trials of his time, including the Overend and Gurney and the Tichborne cases. He became Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1865, and a bencher of the Inner Temple.

== Solicitor-General and House of Commons, 1874–1885 ==
Giffard twice contested Cardiff for the Conservatives in 1868 and 1874, but he was still without a seat in the House of Commons when he was appointed Solicitor-General by Disraeli in 1875 and received the customary knighthood. He also failed to gain a seat in a by-election in Horsham in 1876.

In 1877 he succeeded in obtaining a seat, when he was returned for Launceston, which he continued to represent until his elevation to the peerage.

Between 1883 and 1919, he had been the constable of Launceston Castle, he was appointed by Edward VII, Duke of Cornwall.

== Lord Chancellor and House of Lords, 1885–1905 ==
In 1885, Giffard was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s first administration, and was created Baron Halsbury, of Halsbury in the County of Devon, thus forming a remarkable exception to the rule that no criminal lawyer could ever reach the woolsack. He resumed the position in 1886 and held it until 1892 and again from 1895 to 1905, his tenure of the office, broken only by the brief Liberal ministries of 1886 and 1892–1895, being longer than that of any Lord Chancellor since Lord Eldon. In 1898 he was created Earl of Halsbury and Viscount Tiverton, of Tiverton, Devon.

Halsbury was an opponent of the British trade union movement and used his position to appoint anti-union justices in the judicial system, leading to decisions such as &quot;Taff Vale Rly Co v Amalgamated Society of Rly Servants&quot; and &quot;Quinn v Leathem&quot; which restricted the unions&#x27; right to strike. The legal threats to trade unions at this time drove them to form the Labour Party to seek parliamentary representation.

== Later career and leader of the &quot;ditchers&quot;, 1905–1921 ==
During the crisis over the Parliament Act 1911, Halsbury was one of the principal leaders of the rebel faction of Tory peers—labelled the &quot;Ditchers&quot;—that resolved on all out opposition to the government&#x27;s bill limiting the House of Lords&#x27; veto whatever happened. At a meeting of Conservative peers on 21 July of that year, Halsbury shouted out &quot;I will divide even if I am alone&quot;. As Halsbury left the meeting a reporter asked him what was going to happen. Halsbury immediately replied: &quot;Government by a Cabinet controlled by rank socialists&quot;.

Halsbury was also President of the Royal Society of Literature, Grand Warden of English Freemasons, and High Steward of the University of Oxford, and warden of guild of undergraduates in University of Birmingham. He also became the chairman of guilds in the London institute, president of royal society of literature in 1911–12.

Halsbury&#x27;s lasting legacy was the compilation of a complete digest of &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England&quot; (1907–1917), a major reference work published in many volumes and often called simply &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws&quot; was followed by a second multiple-volume reference work in 1929, &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Statutes&quot;, and later by &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Statutory Instruments&quot;.

Lord Halsbury died on 11 December 1921, aged 98. 

==Family==
Halsbury married firstly Caroline, daughter of William Corne Humphreys, in 1852. There were no children from this marriage. Caroline died in September 1873. Halsbury married secondly Wilhelmina, daughter of Henry Woodfall, in 1874. He died in December 1921, aged 98, and was succeeded by his only son from his second marriage, Hardinge. The Countess of Halsbury died in December 1927.

== Character and assessment ==

=== Appearance ===
According to Herbert Stephen, &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s features were good, and expressive of power and resolution; his short and stoutly built figure lent itself to caricature.&quot; To G. R. Rubin, writing later, &quot;In physical appearance he was somewhat plain and unprepossessing. He had a broad body, and a large head without eyelashes and with an upraised nose. His short legs accentuated his dumpy and pugnacious appearance. But he exuded an expression of power and resolution.&quot;

=== Assessments ===
Assessments of Halsbury have varied over the decades. Halsbury&#x27;s death was not acknowledged in the pages of the &quot;Law Quarterly Review&quot;, whereas Lord Lindley, who had passed away two days before Halsbury, was the subject of a tribute.

==Notable judgments==
Among cases in which Halsbury delivered judgment are:

*&quot;Salomon v Salomon&quot;
*&quot;Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow &amp; Co&quot; [1892] AC 25
*&quot;British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique&quot; [1893] AC 602 – the House of Lords overturned a Court of Appeal decision and by so doing established the &quot;Mozambique rule&quot;, a common law rule in private international law that renders actions relating to title in foreign land, the right to possession of foreign land, and trespass to foreign land non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions.
*&quot;Bray v Ford&quot; [1896] AC 44
*&quot;Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants&quot; [1901] AC 426
*&quot;Daimler Co Ltd v Continental Tyre and Rubber Co (Great Britain) Ltd&quot; [1916] 2 AC 307

<doc id="446522" wikidata="Q192757" url="?curid=446522" title="T-90">
<text>The T-90 is a third-generation Russian main battle tank developed from, and designed to replace the T-72. It uses a 125mm 2A46 smoothbore main gun, the 1A45T fire-control system, an upgraded engine, and gunner&#x27;s thermal sight. Standard protective measures include a blend of steel and composite armour, smoke grenade dischargers, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour (ERA) and the Shtora infrared anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) jamming system.

The T-90 was designed and built by Uralvagonzavod, in Nizhny Tagil, Russia. It entered service with the Russian army in 1992.

==Development==
The T-90 has its origins in a Soviet-era program aimed at developing a replacement for the T-64, T-72 and T-80 series of main battle tanks (MBT). The T-72 platform was selected as the basis for the new generation of tank owing to its cost-effectiveness, simplicity and automotive qualities. The Kartsev-Venediktov Design Bureau from Nizhny Tagil was responsible for the design work and prepared two parallel proposals—the &quot;Object 188&quot;, which was a relatively simple upgrade of the existing T-72B tank (&quot;Object 184&quot;), and the far more advanced &quot;Object 187&quot;—only vaguely related to the T-72 series and incorporating major improvements to the hull and turret design, armor, powerplant and armament. Development work was approved in 1986 and the first prototypes were completed by 1988. The vehicles resulting from the &quot;Object 187&quot; program have not been declassified to this date.

The Object 188 was engineered by a team under V.N. Venediktov. The biggest change was the integration of the T-80U&#x27;s 1A45 fire-control system. The Object 188 was initially designated as the T-72BM. The first four of these were delivered for trials in January 1989. An improved variant (called Upgraded T-72B) was delivered beginning in June 1990. In March 1991, the Soviet Ministry of Defense recommended that the Army adopt the Object 188. Work on the Object 187 was simultaneously stopped for unknown reasons.

==Production and service history==
Russian tank production dwindled in the years before and after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The Kharkov tank plant belonged to the newly independent Ukraine, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant ended production in 1989, and Kirov in Leningrad in 1990. In the two remaining tank plants at Omsk and Nizhni-Tagil, state orders all but ceased in 1992. Around the same time, the Russian Ministry of Defense decided it would commit to eventually producing just one tank type.

During the 1980s, the Soviet military had ordered T-64s, T-72s and T-80s, then in simultaneous production from rival tank design firms. Though all three tanks had similar characteristics, they each required different components, which contributed to the Army&#x27;s logistical burden. Though both Nizhni-Tagil&#x27;s T-90 and Omsk&#x27;s T-80U had their merits, the T-80&#x27;s gas turbine engine was notorious for its high fuel consumption and poor reliability. Additionally, Russian T-80s suffered heavy losses in their first combat use during the First Chechen War. Meanwhile, the T-90 was spared media criticism as it was not deployed in Chechnya, and its new name distanced it from the T-72, which was also lost in large numbers in the conflict.

In January 1996, Colonel General Aleksandr Galkin, chief of the Main Armor Directorate of the Russian Ministry of Defense, said the Russian Armed Forces would phase out T-80 production in favor of the T-90 (Galkin reversed his position later that year, claiming the T-80U was a superior tank). Production of the T-80 at Omsk persisted until 2001, mainly for the export market.

The principal upgrade in the T-90 is the incorporation of a slightly modified form of the T-80U&#x27;s more sophisticated 1A45T &quot;Irtysh&quot; fire control system and an upgraded V-84MS multi-fuel engine developing 840 hp (618 kW). The T-90 was manufactured at the Uralvagonzavod factory in Nizhny Tagil, with low-level production being carried out since 1992 and virtually ceasing towards the end of the 1990s for the native market. Around 120 T-90 tanks were delivered to the Russian Ground Forces before production of an upgraded version was resumed in 2004.

By September 1995, some 107 T-90 tanks had been produced, located in the Siberian Military District. Later, another U.S. report said that &quot;..with only 150 built by mid-1998, the Siberian Military District&#x27;s 21st Motor Rifle Division received [some of] these MBTs and formed a tank regiment (T-90s were also issued to the 5th Don Guards Tank Division in Buryatia).&quot; However, the 21st MRD had already been reduced to the status of a motor-rifle brigade by this time, and then was reduced to a storage base in 1997.

Facing tapering domestic orders, Uralvagonzavod received government approval to export the T-90 in the mid-1990s. The designers at Uralvagonzavod created a new, welded turret that offered improvements in protection and internal space in the same period. In 1997, India signaled interest in the T-90 in response to Pakistan&#x27;s acquisition of 320 Ukrainian T-80UD tanks. India&#x27;s Heavy Vehicles Factory in Avadi was already license-manufacturing the T-72 under the name &quot;Ajeya&quot;.

The first 42 complete Indian tanks were delivered in 2001 and were designated T-90S (Object 188S), still equipped with the older cast turrets of the early series (this exhausted the remaining stocks of cast turrets warehoused at Nizhny Tagil) and powered by the V-84 engine making 840 hp (618 kW). In 2002, 82 vehicles were delivered, now equipped with the new welded turrets and the V-92S2 engine, generating 1,000 hp (735 kW). The initial contract stipulated the following batch of 186 tanks, now officially called Bhishma, to be completed in India from Russian-supplied kits, and then gradually replaced with domestically manufactured parts. Delays in domestic production compelled the Indian authorities to place an additional order for 127 complete vehicles from Uralvagonzavod.
In 2005 the Russian army resumed delivery of the T-90, requesting the &quot;original&quot; specification for the vehicle with a cast turret. But with the new order numbering 14 tanks, and the large capital investment required to set up production of new cast turrets, the Russian Ministry of Defence agreed on a new configuration very close to the Indian T-90S, which was expeditiously accepted into service without any trials as the Object 188A1 or T-90A. 2005 saw delivery of 18 new tanks – enough to equip approximately five tank platoons. These new Russian tanks were powered by the V-92S2 engine, carried a T01-K05 &quot;Buran-M&quot; gunner&#x27;s sight (passive-active night-vision channel with an EPM-59G &quot;Mirage-K&quot; matrix and a maximum observation distance of 1,800 m) and were protected by the most recent Kontakt-5 reactive armor with 4S22 explosive tiles.

The years 2006–2007 saw the delivery of 31 T-90A tanks each, now fitted with entirely passive ESSA main gunner&#x27;s sights supplied by Peleng in Belarus and using the 2nd-generation thermal camera Catherine-FC from Thales, and improved 4S23 ERA tiles. The joint venture established on the basis of JSC Volzhsky Optical and Mechanical Plant (VOMZ) and Thales Optronics, produced Catherine-FC thermal imaging devices, which were further used to develop &quot;ESSA&quot;, &quot;PLISA&quot; and &quot;SOSNA-U&quot; sighting systems produced for the Russian armoured vehicles, including T-72B3 tanks and export versions of T-90S (exported to India, Algeria and Azerbaijan). Since 2012, Russia was able to produce 3rd-generation Catherine-XP cameras based on QWIP matrix technology.

In 2012, the Russian-made commander combined sample supervisory-sighting system &quot;T01-K04DT/Agat-MDT&quot; was presented to the public at the International Forum Engineering Technologies 2012. According to Krasnogorsky Zavod plant, Agat-MDT has the ability to install (for further modernization) in the sight the newly developed domestic UPF format 640×512 by 15 microns, which makes possible in the future to extend the range of target identification at night to 3.5–4.0 km without modifications to the sight.

In 2016, the Krasnogorsk plant finished testing the &quot;Irbis-K&quot; night-vision sighting system for the T-80U and T-90, with first deliveries planned for 2017. Completion of the Irbis-K, the first Russian-produced mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) matrix thermal sight, addressed a disadvantage of Russian tanks relative to their Western counterparts. The Irbis-K can identify targets at ranges up to 3,240 meters during day and night.

In 2007, there were about 334 T-90 tanks of various types serving in the Russian Ground Forces&#x27; 5th Guards Tank Division, stationed in the Siberian Military District, and seven T-90 tanks assigned to the marines. Since 2008, the Russian army has received 62 tanks annually, suspending orders in 2011.

After the cancellation of the T-95 in 2010, Uralvagonzavod began the OKR Armata (Armament) design study. The study resulted in the Object 148 based on the T-95 (itself based on the Object 187). The Russian Army curtailed T-90 orders beginning in 2012 to prepare for the arrival of the new tank. In July 2021, Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said the tank, designated the T-14 Armata, will enter serial production in 2022.

Deliveries of upgraded T-90M tanks started in April 2020 to the Guards Tank Army of the RF Western Military District. The T-90M ‘Proryv’ (‘Breakthrough’) has received a principally new turret, the 2A46M-5 gun, and a more powerful engine. The Proryv is outfitted with a new multi-channel sighting system that allows employing weapons at any time of day or night and it can exchange data with other vehicles in real time. A new batch was delivered in March 2021. According to Ukrainian intelligence sources, manufacturing of T-90s was slowed because of the effect of International sanctions since the start of the invasion of Ukraine. An article from &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in early October 2023 suggested a rise in T-90M&#x27;s production based on the increasing amount of T90 losses in Ukraine.

The UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) estimates that annual production of T-90M tanks could reach up to 90 units in 2024. Analysis suggests, however, that the majority of these T-90Ms are likely upgrades of older T-90A models rather than newly built tanks. Sources indicate that over 200 T-90Ms have been delivered since the war in Ukraine started. The UK-based &quot;Military Watch Magazine&quot; reported in September 2024 that efforts to surge the production rate to well over 1000 per year had fallen far short, with the output remaining uncertain with some reports indicating that over 300 T-90Ms would be delivered throughout the year.

==Combat use==
===Russian service===
An early variant of the export-oriented T-90S allegedly saw combat action during the 1999 Chechen invasion of Dagestan instead of being delivered to India. The tank&#x27;s survivability against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) is disputed. Gordon L. Rottman writes that T-90s were &quot;frequently&quot; knocked out by three or four hits from a RPG-7. He adds that Chechens found a way to compromise T-90s fitted with explosive reactive armor: they would fire an RPG-7 from close range (within 50m) to trigger the explosive reactive armor protection, and then re-attack the exposed tank armour underneath with two or more RPG hits, again from close range.

On the other hand, &quot;Moscow Defense Brief&quot; gives the example of one T-90 that remained in action despite being hit by seven RPGs. The journal concluded that with regular equipment, the upgraded T-90 seems to be the best protected Russian tank, especially with the implementation of Shtora-1 and Arena defensive systems.

The T-90A was deployed to Syria in 2015 to support the Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War.

In September 2020, a Russian T-90 was accidentally hit by an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) during exercises held in Russia&#x27;s Astrakhan region causing serious damage to the vehicle.

====Russo-Ukrainian War====
During the war in Donbas stage of the Russo-Ukrainian War in the summer of 2014, elements of the Russian 136th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade equipped with T-90A tanks conducting operations in Luhansk Oblast of Ukraine were identified in social media posts, and locations of their photographs were geolocated by open-source investigators.

During the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine beginning in February 2022, by 12 May, a T-90 was reported to have been destroyed by a Swedish Carl Gustaf man-portable anti-tank grenade launcher in Kharkiv.

During this conflict, the T-90 has faced and been destroyed by many types of anti-tank missiles, including modern &quot;top attack&quot; missiles such as the American-produced FGM-148 Javelin and the Anglo-Swedish NLAW. The Arena system has not appeared in Ukraine and it is unclear if the system has met expectations.

In January 2024, in fighting around Stepove, two Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFV) from the Ukrainian 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade engaged a T-90M. The tank was disabled by the Bradleys, and its crew escaped before a FPV drone destroyed the tank.

In late September 2024, reports backed by images shared on social media showed a destroyed T-90M that lacked Relikt ERA. The ERA bricks had been replaced by &quot;construction bricks&quot;.

As of 6 February 2025, Oryx blog had documented that Russia had lost at least 178 T-90s since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (visually confirmed), including 42 T-90A (of which 29 were destroyed, 3 abandoned, 10 captured), 1 T-90AK (captured), 11 T-90S (9 destroyed, 1 abandoned, 1 captured) and 124 T-90M (73 destroyed, 15 damaged, 29 abandoned, 7 captured).

===Syrian service===
In early February 2016, Syrian Army forces began using T-90As in combat. A video was leaked on the internet which showed a T-90 survive a direct frontal turret hit by a TOW missile in Aleppo. The Kontakt-5 reactive armor discharged the TOW warhead before impact. Two Syrian Army operated T-90 were captured by HTS militias while ISIS fighters captured a third in November 2017. A rebel operated T-90 was recaptured by Syrian government forces while the second was reportedly destroyed in combat by a T-72. Another 5 Syrian Army operated T-90 tanks were knocked out or heavily damaged and 4 others suffered hits, according to recorded material.

===Azerbaijani service===
Azerbaijan used their T-90S tanks during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. One T-90 was damaged and captured by Armenian forces. At least two were confirmed destroyed in the initial phases of the war, being the first ever proven total loss of the combat vehicle.

==Export==
===India===

The T-90S Bhishma (named after the guardian warrior in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;) is a vehicle tailored for Indian service, improving upon the T-90S, and developed with assistance from Russia and France. The tanks are equipped with the French Thales-built Catherine-FC thermal sights. They use Russian Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour, in addition to the primary armor, which consists of laminated plates and ceramic layers with high-tensile properties. The new welded turrets first developed for the Indian T-90S Bhishma have more advanced armour protection than the early cast turrets.

In 2001, India purchased 310 T-90S tanks from Russia, of which 124 were delivered complete (42 featured the early cast turrets seen on Russian tanks) and 186 were to be assembled from kits delivered in various stages of completion with an emphasis on shifting production to domestic means. The T-90 was selected because it is a direct development of the T-72 that India already manufactured, simplifying training and maintenance. India opted to acquire the T-90 to counter Pakistani deployment of the Ukrainian-made T-80 tank in 1995–97. These T-90S tanks were made by Uralvagonzavod and the engines were delivered by Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. The Indian tanks however omit the Shtora-1 passive electronic countermeasure system which was deemed obsolete.

A follow-on contract, worth US$800 million, was signed in October 2006, for another 330 T-90S &quot;Bhishma&quot; MBTs that were to be manufactured in India by Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi, Tamil Nadu.

The T-90M features the &#x27;Kaktus K-6&#x27; bolted explosive reactive armour (ERA) package on its frontal hull and turret-top (the T-90S has &#x27;Kontakt-5&#x27; ERA), is fitted with an enhanced environmental control system supplied by Israel&#x27;s Kinetics Ltd for providing cooled air to the fighting compartment, has additional internal volume for housing the cryogenic cooling systems for new-generation thermal imagers like the THALES-built Catherine-FC thermal imager (operating in the 8–12 micrometre bandwidth). In all, India plans to have 2,080 T-90 tanks in service by 2020.

A third contract, worth $1.23 billion, was signed in December 2007 for 347 upgraded T-90Ms, most to be licence-assembled by HVF. The Army hoped to field a force of over 21 regiments of T-90 tanks and 40 regiments of modified T-72s. The Indian Army began receiving its first T-90M main battle tank in completely knocked-down form from Russia&#x27;s Nizhny Tagil-based Uralvagonzavod JSC at the end of 2009.

The first batch of 10 T-90Ms built under licence was inducted into the Indian army in August 2009. These vehicles were built at the Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi, Tamil Nadu.

A purchase of 354 new T-90SM tanks for six tank regiments for the China border was being planned in 2012, making India, with a total of nearly 4,500 tanks (T-90 and variants, T-72 and Arjun MBT) in active service, the world&#x27;s third-largest operator of tanks.

India planned to have 21 T-90 tank regiments by 2020, with 45 combat tanks and 17 training and replacement tanks per regiment. In November 2019, India announced that Heavy Vehicles Factory would produce 464 T-90 MBTs for 10 tank regiments. In 2021, the Indian army was looking to upgrade its T-90 tank fleet with locally built modular Active Protection, with both soft kill and hard kill systems, to update the tanks to modern standards.

On 25 February 2022, The Acquisition Wing of the Defence Ministry has signed a contract valued at Rs.1,075 crore with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) to retro-modify 957 T-90s with advanced Mid Wave Thermal Image (MWIR), which will replace the existing Image Converter (IC)-based sight.

On 13 May 2024, Heavy Vehicles Factory delivered the first batch of 10 units of &quot;Bhishma&quot; Mk. 3, which is a more advanced variant of T-90, as a part of the 464 tank deal signed in 2019. The rest of 454 tanks will be delivered within five years. Enhancements included increase in indigenous content and several upgrades. The upgrades included advanced Mid Wave Thermal Image-based sighting systems (8 km range) and Laser Range Finder (LRF; 5 km range) for commanders developed by DRDO and BEL (replacing Image Converter tube-based sight on older versions), a Digital Ballistic Computer to improve ammunition trajectory (derived from that of Arjun MBT), Automatic Target Tracker. It is also expected that the new variant tanks will feature new generation ammunition like FSAPDS Mk2 (originally developed for Arjun MBT), and cannon-launched SAMHO missiles that is under development. Reports also suggest the use of a more efficient and powerful engine. There are plans for further upgradation of the T-90 tanks by including indigenous Active Protection Systems, Loitering Munitions and more advanced ammunitions. India started the licensed production of Russian tank rounds 3VBM17 used by the T-72 and T-90 tanks in July 2024.

On 7 October 2024, the Indian Army Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers completed the first complete overhaul of the T-90 Bhishma at the 505 Army Base Workshop in Delhi Cantonment. The overhauled T-90 belongs to the first batch of such tanks received by India. This significantly extends the series life in service with the army.

On 3 February 2025, the Army released a Request for Information (RFI) to identify prospective vendors for the development of an active protection system for the T-90S/SK tank fleet. While explosive reactive armour protects the tanks from shoulder-fired missile, an APS is important for protection from tandem warheads in top-attack mode. The system being offered must feature Soft Kill, Hard Kill and Counter Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) measures and without compromising it&#x27;s existing capabilities. It should be capable of detecting detecting all types of UAS (including loitering UAVs, first person view (FPV), swarm, and Kamikaze drones) as well as all kinds of anti-tank projectiles (like anti-tank guided missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and chemical and kinetic energy munitions). The document stated that the system should not compromise the mobility of the vehicle and be operable in high altitude terrains. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has started work on a similar systems in 2024.

===Other===
In 2005, deliveries began for an initial order of 185 tanks for Algeria. These are known as the T-90SA (&quot;A&quot; is an acronym for Algeria).

The Cyprus House Defence Committee approved funds in January 2009 for the purchase of 41 Russian-built T-90 tanks. The money was included as part of the 2009 defence budget. Cyprus already operates the Russian-made T-80 tank. In March 2010 it was reported that Cyprus had opted for 41 additional T-80s instead of purchasing T-90s.

Anonymous Venezuelan defence sources said that president Hugo Chavez &quot;wants to replace his army&#x27;s obsolete AMX-30 main battle tanks with between 50 and 100 Russian-built T-90 main battle tanks&quot;, according to an October 2008 article by analyst Jack Sweeney. In September 2009 a deal was announced for 92 T-72s only. Saudi Arabia was reported, in July 2008, by Russian daily &quot;Kommersant&quot; to be in negotiations to buy 150 T-90 tanks. Lebanese Defence Minister Elias El Murr met with Russian Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov in December 2008, when they discussed the possibility of a transfer of military equipment including T-90 tanks.

In February 2010, an arms deal was signed between Libya and Russia. Details of the sale were not immediately released, but a Russian diplomat stated that Libya had wanted 20 fighter planes, air defence systems, and may also be interested in purchasing &quot;several dozen&quot; T-90s, and modernising a further 140 T-72s. However, after Libya&#x27;s crackdown on anti-government protesters in early 2011, the United Nations enacted an international arms embargo on Libya resulting in the cancellation of Russian arms deals.

In April 2013, Rosoboronexport requested for the entry of the T-90S in an upcoming tender by the Peruvian Army for main battle tanks. Peru sought to acquire between 120 and 170 tanks to replace its aging T-55 tanks. The T-90 was tested against the M1A1 Abrams from the United States, the Leopard 2A4 offered from the Spanish Army, Leopard 2A6s formerly operated by the Dutch Army, and T-64s and T-84s offered by Ukraine. By September 2013, only the T-90S, the Russian T-80, the Ukrainian T-84, and American M1A1 were still competing.

Vietnam and Iraq signed contracts for at least 150 T-90S/SK tanks in 2016.

==Design==
===Armament===

The T-90&#x27;s main armament is the 2A46M 125mm smoothbore tank gun. This is a highly modified version of the Sprut anti-tank gun, and is the same gun used as the main armament on the T-80-series tanks. It can be replaced without dismantling the inner turret and can fire armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS), high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT-FS), and high-explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG) ammunition, and 9M119M Refleks anti-tank guided missiles. The Refleks has semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) laser beam riding guidance and a tandem shaped charge HEAT warhead. It has an effective range of 100 m to 6 km, and takes 17.5 seconds to reach maximum range. Refleks can penetrate about of steel rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) and can also engage low-flying air targets such as helicopters.

The NSV 12.7mm (12.7×108) remotely controlled anti-aircraft heavy machine gun can be operated from within the tank by the commander and has a range of 2 km and a cyclic rate of fire of 700–800 rounds per minute with 300 rounds available (the NSV was replaced by the Kord heavy machine gun in the late 1990s). The PKMT 7.62mm (7.62×54mmR) coaxial machine gun weighs about 10.5 kg while the ammunition box carries 250 rounds (2,000 rounds carried) and weighs an additional 9.5 kg.

Like other modern Russian tanks the 2A46M in the T-90 is fed by an automatic loader which removes the need for a manual loader in the tank and reduces the crew to 3 (commander, gunner, and driver). The autoloader can carry 22 ready-to-fire rounds in its carousel and can load a round in 5–8 seconds. It has been suggested that the automatic loaders on modern T-90 tanks have been modified to take advantage of newer ammunition such as the 3BM-44M APFSDS, which like the US M829A3 penetrates armour better than the previous shorter rounds. HEAT rounds that can be fired from the 2A46M includes the 3BK21B (with a depleted uranium liner), 3BK29 (with a credited penetration of 800mm RHA equivalency), and the 3BK29M (with a Triple-tandem charge warhead). Additionally the T-90 features the Ainet fuse setting system which allows the tank to detonate 3OF26 HE-FRAG rounds at a specific distance from the tank as determined by the gunner&#x27;s laser rangefinder, improving its performance against helicopters and infantry. Accurate firing range of the HE-Frag-FS 10 km, APFSDS 4 km.

Fire-control system of the T-90 showed the following features of combat shooting during state testing. Heavily armoured targets at ranges of up to 5 km were hit by tank T-90 on the move (up to 30 km/h) with a high probability of hit with the first shot. During state testing made 24 launches of missiles at ranges of 4–5 km and they all hit the target (all missile launches were made by inexperienced professionals). An experienced gunner at speeds of 25 km/h hit 7 real armoured targets located at ranges of 1,500–2,500 m and 54sec.

Fire-control system on the T-90 includes the PNK-4S/SR AGAT day and night sighting system mounted at the commanders station which allows for night time detection of a tank sized target at ranges between 700 and 1100 metres depending on the version of the sight. Early models of the T-90 were equipped with the TO1-KO1 BURAN sight but later models (T-90S) were upgraded to use the ESSA thermal imaging sight, which allows for accurate firing to a range of 5,000–8,000m during day and 3,300m during night, using the CATHERINE-FC thermal camera produced by Thales Optronique. The gunner is also provided with the 1G46 day sighting system which includes a laser range finder, missile guidance channel and allows tank-sized targets to be detected and engaged at . The driver uses a TVN-5 day and night sight. In 2010, Russia started licensed production of Thales-developed Catherine FC thermal cameras for T-90M tanks, a Russian daily said. These thermal imagers are also present on T-90M &quot;Bhishma&quot; built in India under licence.

In 2012, the Russian-made combined sample of commander supervisory-sighting system T01-K04DT/Agat-MDT was presented to the public. According to Krasnogorsky Zavod (plant), Agat-MDT has the ability to be installed (for further modernization) in the sight of the newly developed domestic UPF format 640×512 by 15 microns, which is possible in the future to extend the range of target identification at night to 3.5–4.0 km without sight modifications. In 2016, the Krasnogorsk plant finished testing the &quot;Irbis-K&quot; night-vision gunner&#x27;s sighting system for the T-80U and T-90, with first deliveries in 2018. Completion of the Irbis-K, the first Russian-produced mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) matrix thermal sight, will bridge a gap with the leading NATO countries in this area. The Irbis-K can identify tank targets at ranges up to 3,240 meters during day and night.

The Russian-made thermal imaging device not only meant that Russian tanks would no longer need to be equipped with foreign parts, but it also meant that complete tank modernization was cheaper. Furthermore, there will be no decrease in demand for the T-72 and the T-90 in the next few years. The new tank gunner&#x27;s heat-vision sight Irbis-K and the commander&#x27;s combined sighting and observation system Agat-MDT can be supplied to T-72, T-80 and T-90 upgraded versions (T-72B3M, T-80BVM, T-90M...), replacing the Thales Catherine-FC thermal camera.

===Mobility===
The prime mover is the diesel engine, built in the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. Different models of the T-90 tank are powered by various motors in its initial models, like the V-84MS 618 kW (840 hp) four-stroke V-12 piston engine, uprated engines and engines made by Uralvagonzavod and are delivered by Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. The Т-90S with engine can attain a top speed of 60 km/h on the road and up to 45 km/h on rough terrain. The T-90 tank has a typical drivetrain arrangement, with a rear placed engine and transmission. The engines are V-92 four stroke, 12 cylinder, multi-fuel diesel while the engine is V-96. The T-90 export version i.e. modified T-90S is fitted with an increased power multi-fuel diesel engine with turbochargers. The tank has an air conditioning system for work in hot places.

===Protection===

The T-90 has a &quot;three-tiered&quot; protection system. The first tier is the composite armour in the turret, consisting of basic armour shell with an insert of alternating layers of aluminum and plastics and a controlled deformation section.

The second tier is third generation Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour (ERA) bricks which degrade the penetrating power of kinetic-energy APFSDS ammunition. These bricks give the turret a distinctive angled &quot;clam shell&quot; appearance. ERA bricks are also located on the turret roof to protect against attacks from above. The turret&#x27;s forward armour package, in addition to the ERA and steel plating, includes Russian composite armour sandwiched between upper and lower steel plates. Composite armour offers lower weight and better protection than steel-only armour.

The third tier is a Shtora-1 (Russian: Штора-1 or &quot;curtain&quot; in English) countermeasures suite, produced by Elektromashina of Russia. This system includes two electro-optical/IR &quot;dazzlers&quot; (i.e. active infrared jammer) on the front of the turret (which gives the distinctive &quot;Red Eyes&quot;), four laser warning receivers, two 3D6 &#x27;smoke&#x27; grenade discharging systems and a computerised control system. The Shtora-1 warns the tank&#x27;s crew when the tank has been &#x27;painted&#x27; by a weapon-guidance laser and allows the crew to slew the turret to face the threat. The infrared jammer, the TShU1-7 EOCMDAS, jams the semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) guidance system used by some anti-tank guided missiles. The smoke grenades are automatically launched after Shtora detects that it has been painted. The smoke grenades are used to mask a tank from laser rangefinders and designators, and the optics of other weapon systems. Indian T-90S tanks are not equipped with the Shtora-1 countermeasures suite. They will be equipped with the Land Electronic Defence System LEDS-150.

In addition to the passive and active protection systems, the T-90 is also fitted with nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection equipment, KMT mine sweeps and an automatic fire suppression system. The EMT-7 electromagnetic-counter mine system can also be installed on the T-90. EMT-7 emits an electromagnetic pulse to disable magnetic mines and disrupt electronics before the tank reaches them. The Nakidka signature reduction suite is also available for the T-90. Nakidka is designed to reduce the probabilities of an object to be detected by infrared, thermal, radar-thermal, and radar bands.

During a reported test conducted by the Russian military in 1999 the T-90 was exposed to a variety of RPG, ATGM, and APFSDS munitions. When equipped with Kontakt-5 ERA, the T-90 could not be penetrated by any of the APFSDS or ATGM used during the trial and outperformed a T-80U which also took part. During combat operations in Dagestan, there were witness accounts of one T-90 sustaining seven hits from RPGs, and remaining in action.

T-90M and T-90MS mounts the more advanced &quot;Relikt&quot; ERA. Relikt defends against tandem warheads, while reducing the penetration of APFSDS rounds by over 50 percent. It can be installed instead of Kontakt-1 or Kontakt-5.

====Estimated protection level comparison====
The T-90A / T-90S turret uses a stronger steel alloy, giving an approximately 10–15% increase in the protection level given from the steel elements of the armor array; as the array from many aspects is not wholly steel, the overall increase in protection is less than this margin over these areas. Protection values will decrease somewhat against Tandem HEAT or penetrators with precursor tips. These measures are not as effective against heavier, newer generations of E.R.A. such as Relikt.

The actual level of protection provided by the T-90 was questioned after some of these models were destroyed or captured during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

====Turret issues====
The T-90 has an unknown issue that causes it to become disabled via the turret spinning uncontrollably. Currently there is no concrete understanding of what precisely causes this issue, but a theory by a former tank commander of the British Army, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, states: &quot;It’ll likely be a combination between inexperienced crews and poor electronics.&quot;

==Variants==


* T-90 (Object 188) – The first production version. Object 188 (1989), production 1992. At one point during development it was designated as the Upgraded T-72B. 46 tons.
** – Commander&#x27;s version of the T-90, with additional communication (R-163-50K station) and navigation equipment (TNA-4-3).
** – Russian army version with welded turret, V-92S2 engine and ESSA thermal viewer. Sometimes called T-90 Vladimir, in honor of its chief designer Vladimir Potkin.
** – Command version of the T-90A.
** T-90AM (&quot;Proryv-2&quot;) – Upgrade of T-90A which was later developed into the T-90MS. Featured a new turret developed in the &quot;Proryv-2&quot; program. Revealed in 2011. 48 tons. Not in service.
* T-90M (&quot;Proryv-3&quot;) – Heavily upgraded version of the T-90, first appearance in public in 2017. The main feature is the modernization of turret design (&quot;all welded&quot; instead of cast) with the new advanced fire control system Kalina (with integrated combat information and control systems), new PNM-T gunner&#x27;s sight and four video cameras that provide a 360° view of the environment for the commander, new upgraded gun 2A46M-5 with coaxial machine gun of 7.62 mm, weapon station &quot;UDP T05BV-1&quot; with the remotely controlled machine gun of 12.7 mm &quot;Kord&quot;. There is improved armor on the ammunition carousel. Each side of the hull is fitted with additional armor plates at the front and slat armor at the rear. The new version also includes brand new Relikt ERA on turret and hull, &quot;soft kill&quot; APS Shtora-1 without the (now obsolete) jammers, and &quot;hard kill&quot; APS Arena-M. ERA on the front of the turret is made of one &quot;cast&quot; and is easily replaceable in the field by a crew. Other improvements include a new 1130hp V-92S2F engine coupled with automatic transmission, an enhanced environmental control system and GLONASS satellite navigation systems. It also features an upgraded autoloader AZ-185M2 which allows for longer (and thus more effective) APFSDS ammunition Svinets-1 and Svinets-2. Much of the ammunition stored outside the autoloader has been moved from around the hull to the rear of the turret with added blowout panels in the event the ammunition suffers a catastrophic explosion, protecting the crew and other sensitive equipment.
* – Export version of the T-90, later adopted by the Russian Armed Forces as the T-90A. These tanks were made by Uralvagonzavod and were updated with 1,000hp (750kW) engines made by Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. These tanks carry an export version of the Shtora-1 passive/active protection system which lacks the infra-red dazzlers carried on the turret, however this area was covered with more Kontakt-5. These were initially supplied with cast turrets of the early T-90, and when stocks were depleted, new, welded turrets were fabricated.
** – Commander&#x27;s version of the T-90S, with additional communication and navigation equipment. It differs in radio and navigation equipment and Ainet remote-detonation system for HEF rounds.
* – Export variant of T-90AM (&quot;Proryv-2&quot;), first time showed in Abu Dhabi IDEX-2013. It is equipped with a 1,130 hp engine, a Sosna-U gunner sight, a UDP T05BV-1 RWS with a 7.62mm machine gun, GLONASS, inertial navigation systems, new Relikt explosive reactive armour that covers more of the tank, and a steering wheel. A new removable turret bustle is included, which provides storage for eight additional rounds. The T-90MS is ready for serial production. Four video cameras provide a 360° view of the environment, while the tank is more connected to command. The T-90SM has an upgraded thermal imager that can detect tanks over 3,300 meters away. The same autoloader as the T-90M &quot;Proryv-3&quot; is used.

Variants
* IMR-2MA: Combat engineer vehicle. Referred to as the IMR-3M by some sources.
* MTU-90: Bridge layer tank with MLC50 bridge.
* UBIM (Universal Armored Engineering Vehicle): It was unveiled at the Army-2018 international arms show.

<text>Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne, (27 November 1812 – 4 May 1895) was an English lawyer and politician. He served twice as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

==Background and education==
Palmer was born at Mixbury in Oxfordshire, where his father, William Jocelyn Palmer, was rector. His mother Dorothea was daughter of the Rev. William Roundell of Gledstone Hall, Yorkshire. William Palmer and Edwin Palmer were his brothers. He was educated at Rugby School and Winchester College.

Palmer proceeded to the University of Oxford, matriculating from Christ Church, moving to Trinity College upon winning a scholarship there, and becoming a fellow of Magdalen College in 1834. He graduated BA in 1834 and MA in 1836. While at Oxford he became a close friend of the hymnist and theologian, Frederick William Faber. At Oxford he won the Chancellor&#x27;s Prize for Latin Verse in 1831, the Ireland Scholarship in Greek and the Newdigate Prize in 1832, the Eldon Law Scholarship in 1834 and the Chancellor&#x27;s Latin Essay Prize in 1835. He was President of the Oxford Union in 1832.

==Political career==
Palmer was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1837. He preferred practice at the equity bar, and avoided juries. From 1840 to 1843 he was a leader writer for &quot;The Times&quot;. He was elected to the House of Commons for Plymouth in 1847. A Peelite, he was defeated in 1852, but was returned in a by-election the following year. He lost his seat in 1857, and was defeated again in 1859.

In 1861, Palmer was appointed Solicitor General in the government of Lord Palmerston and was returned unopposed for Richmond, receiving the customary knighthood. In 1863 he was promoted Attorney General, continuing in office under Lord Russell after Palmerston&#x27;s death in 1865, until the government&#x27;s defeat in 1866. His position as a law officer of the Crown meant that he had to handle the many questions of international law that arose out of the American Civil War, including the &quot;Alabama&quot; affair.

An early follower of Gladstone, Palmer broke with him over the disestablishment of the Irish Church. After the Liberals were returned in the 1868 election, he refused Gladstone&#x27;s offers to appoint him either as Lord Chancellor or Lord Chief Justice, preferring to be free to oppose Irish disestablishment as a backbencher. He was the leading counsel for Britain before the Alabama Claims tribunal in Geneva.

Despite his continuing opposition to the government on Irish and Church issues, Palmer was appointed on 15 October 1872 as Lord Chancellor under Gladstone. He was created Baron Selborne, of Selborne in the County of Southampton, and was sworn of the Privy Council. His first tenure in office saw the passage of the Judicature Act 1873, which reorganised the English judiciary. Selborne again held the Lord Chancellorship under Gladstone in 1880–1885. In the latter year he established a Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department. He was created Viscount Wolmer, of Blackmoor in the County of Southampton, and the Earl of Selborne in 1882.
After the fall of Gladstone in 1885, Selborne became increasingly alarmed by perceived radical tendencies within the Liberal Party. He finally broke with Gladstone over Irish Home Rule, refusing reappointment as Lord Chancellor when the Liberals returned to office in 1886, and joining the Liberal Unionists.

==Honours==
Selborne was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1860. He was an honorary fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford and an honorary Student of Christ Church, Oxford, High Steward of the University of Oxford and Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews.

==Judicial decisions==

==Family==

Selborne married Lady Laura, daughter of William Waldegrave, 8th Earl Waldegrave, in 1848. They had four daughters followed by a son. Their eldest, Laura Elizabeth, was born in 1848 and became an author and social reformer, who in 1876 married George Ridding, the first Bishop of Southwell, so becoming known as Lady Laura Ridding. Their second, Mary Dorothea (1850–1933), married her first cousin, the 9th Earl Waldegrave in 1874. Their third, Sophia Matilda (1852–1915), named after her great-great-aunt, Princess Sophia Matilda of Gloucester, was a writer of fiction and married Amable Charles Franquet, Comte de Franqueville, in 1903. Their fourth, Sarah Wilfreda (1854–1910) married her second cousin, George Tournay Biddulph, son of Robert Biddulph, in 1883. Their son William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne later became a prominent Unionist politician. Lady Selborne died in April 1885. Lord Selborne survived her by ten years and died in May 1895, aged 82.

<doc id="446536" wikidata="Q3778806" url="?curid=446536" title="Guerrilla art">
<text>Guerrilla art is a street art movement that first emerged in the UK, but has since spread around the world and is now established in most countries that already had developed graffiti scenes. In fact, it owes so much to the early graffiti movement, in the United States guerrilla art is still referred to as &#x27;post-graffiti art&#x27;.
Guerrilla art differs from other art forms in it has no external boundary between the image and the environment. While a traditional painting can be moved from one gallery to another without the meaning or the artistic credibility of the piece being affected, street art is environmental, the surface to which it is applied to being as fundamental to the piece&#x27;s meaning as that which is applied. Without the dynamics of modern life, guerrilla art is reduced to &#x27;art for arts sake&#x27; and would be defined by &quot;what it is&quot; as opposed to &quot;what it does&quot;.

The production of guerrilla art is focused on cause and effect, not the material piece itself. It aims to produce an effect within the minds of those people who live within the environment being altered. It does not necessarily aim to produce meaningful art in itself.

== Guerrilla artists ==
Guerrilla artists increasingly seem to be moving towards a philosophy of painting a continuous work of art, adding to it over time as less developed elements of the piece are erased by graffiti cleaning efforts or in the battle for space. Art on canvas is not guerrilla art. Although many guerrilla artists regularly produce &#x27;trapped art&#x27;, they do not generally consider it to be the same thing. This has manifested itself in a wave of new canvas styles that have a guerrilla art style, but are more comprehensive and finished. Few traditional artists would create artwork intentionally meaning for it to be mass produced with little fidelity and put up with wheatpaste. Many guerrilla artists hijack major branding for their own publicity and identity, often at odds with the brand itself. This can be seen with D*Face&#x27;s hijacking of the Walt Disney signature.

It&#x27;s not a movement that attempts to support or to oppose brand conditioning. It is the general public&#x27;s artistic response to it.

=== Artists ===

* Banksy is an English-based graffiti artist, political activist and film director whose real identity is unknown. Their satirical street art and subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti executed in a distinctive stenciling technique. Their works of political and social commentary have been featured on streets, walls, and bridges of cities throughout the world.

* In 1978 in downtown Wellington, New Zealand, Barry Thomas planted 180 cabbages forming the word &#x27;CABBAGE&#x27; on the corner of Willis and Manners Streets where a hotel and theatre had been demolished. This &#x27;public art project&#x27; was called &quot;The vacant lot of cabbages&quot; aka &quot;The cabbage patch.&quot; Thomas&#x27;s intention was to promote inner city parks rather than commercial development. The cabbages lasted six months during which time city residents added to the site and took part in poetry readings and performances.

== Use in advertising campaigns ==
The principles of guerrilla art have occasionally been adopted by corporations in various forms of guerrilla marketing, particularly viral marketing and street marketing. Such activity may be conducted either directly or through the use of front groups, and is used to promote a product or service.

Controversies have arisen over corporate guerrilla campaigns. In 2006, the Australian launch campaign for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which included fake blogs and public graffiti, attracted significant criticism for violating ethical standards. Similarly, in 2007, a Boston-based campaign for &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; caused a citywide bomb scare.

<doc id="446539" wikidata="Q898383" url="?curid=446539" title="Fermionic condensate">
<text>A fermionic condensate (or Fermi–Dirac condensate) is a superfluid phase formed by fermionic particles at low temperatures. It is closely related to the Bose–Einstein condensate, a superfluid phase formed by bosonic atoms under similar conditions. The earliest recognized fermionic condensate described the state of electrons in a superconductor; the physics of other examples including recent work with fermionic atoms is analogous. The first atomic fermionic condensate was created by a team led by Deborah S. Jin using potassium-40 atoms at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2003.

==Background==

===Superfluidity===
Fermionic condensates are attained at lower temperatures than Bose–Einstein condensates. Fermionic condensates are a type of superfluid. As the name suggests, a superfluid possesses fluid properties similar to those possessed by ordinary liquids and gases, such as the lack of a definite shape and the ability to flow in response to applied forces. However, superfluids possess some properties that do not appear in ordinary matter. For instance, they can flow at high velocities without dissipating any energy—i.e. zero viscosity. At lower velocities, energy is dissipated by the formation of quantized vortices, which act as &quot;holes&quot; in the medium where superfluidity breaks down. Superfluidity was originally discovered in liquid helium-4 whose atoms are bosons, not fermions.

=== Fermionic superfluids ===
It is far more difficult to produce a fermionic superfluid than a bosonic one, because the Pauli exclusion principle prohibits fermions from occupying the same quantum state. However, there is a well-known mechanism by which a superfluid may be formed from fermions: That mechanism is the BCS transition, discovered in 1957 by J. Bardeen, L.N. Cooper, and R. Schrieffer for describing superconductivity. These authors showed that, below a certain temperature, electrons (which are fermions) can pair up to form bound pairs now known as Cooper pairs. As long as collisions with the ionic lattice of the solid do not supply enough energy to break the Cooper pairs, the electron fluid will be able to flow without dissipation. As a result, it becomes a superfluid, and the material through which it flows a superconductor.

The BCS theory was phenomenally successful in describing superconductors. Soon after the publication of the BCS paper, several theorists proposed that a similar phenomenon could occur in fluids made up of fermions other than electrons, such as helium-3 atoms. These speculations were confirmed in 1971, when experiments performed by D.D. Osheroff showed that helium-3 becomes a superfluid below 0.0025 K. It was soon verified that the superfluidity of helium-3 arises from a BCS-like mechanism.

=== Condensates of fermionic atoms ===
When Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman produced a Bose–Einstein condensate from rubidium atoms in 1995, there naturally arose the prospect of creating a similar sort of condensate made from fermionic atoms, which would form a superfluid by the BCS mechanism. However, early calculations indicated that the temperature required for producing Cooper pairing in atoms would be too cold to achieve. In 2001, Murray Holland at JILA suggested a way of bypassing this difficulty. He speculated that fermionic atoms could be coaxed into pairing up by subjecting them to a strong magnetic field.

In 2003, working on Holland&#x27;s suggestion, Deborah Jin at JILA, Rudolf Grimm at the University of Innsbruck, and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT managed to coax fermionic atoms into forming molecular bosons, which then underwent Bose–Einstein condensation. However, this was not a true fermionic condensate. On December 16, 2003, Jin managed to produce a condensate out of fermionic atoms for the first time. The experiment involved 500,000 potassium-40 atoms cooled to a temperature of 5×10−8 K, subjected to a time-varying magnetic field.

==Examples==

===Chiral condensate===
A chiral condensate is an example of a fermionic condensate that appears in theories of massless fermions with chiral symmetry breaking, such as the theory of quarks in Quantum Chromodynamics.

===BCS theory===
The BCS theory of superconductivity has a fermion condensate. A pair of electrons in a metal with opposite spins can form a scalar bound state called a Cooper pair. The bound states themselves then form a condensate. Since the Cooper pair has electric charge, this fermion condensate breaks the electromagnetic gauge symmetry of a superconductor, giving rise to the unusual electromagnetic properties of such states.

===QCD===
In quantum chromodynamics (QCD) the chiral condensate is also called the quark condensate. This property of the QCD vacuum is partly responsible for giving masses to hadrons (along with other condensates like the gluon condensate).

In an approximate version of QCD, which has vanishing quark masses for &quot;N&quot; quark flavours, there is an exact chiral symmetry of the theory. The QCD vacuum breaks this symmetry to SU(&quot;N&quot;) by forming a quark condensate. The existence of such a fermion condensate was first shown explicitly in the lattice formulation of QCD. The quark condensate is therefore an order parameter of transitions between several phases of quark matter in this limit.

This is very similar to the BCS theory of superconductivity. The Cooper pairs are analogous to the pseudoscalar mesons. However, the vacuum carries no charge. Hence all the gauge symmetries are unbroken. Corrections for the masses of the quarks can be incorporated using chiral perturbation theory.

===Helium-3 superfluid===
A helium-3 atom is a fermion and at very low temperatures, they form two-atom Cooper pairs which are bosonic and condense into a superfluid. These Cooper pairs are substantially larger than the interatomic separation.

<doc id="446547" wikidata="Q1770122" url="?curid=446547" title="Watford Gap">
<text>Watford Gap is a low-lying area between two hills in the English Midlands, near Daventry and the village of Watford in Northamptonshire. Engineers from Roman times onwards have found it to be the most practical route for connecting the Midlands with South East England. The A5 road, the West Coast Main Line railway, the M1 motorway and a branch of the Grand Union Canal traverse in parallel a space about wide. It has been written and spoken of as marking the divide between Northern England and Southern England.

==Focal point==
Watford Gap is a low point through a range of hills providing an easy route between the South Eastern and Midland areas of England. It is near the small village of Watford, Northamptonshire. The gap is north-east of Daventry and west of Long Buckby. In the era of Roman Britain, the Watling Street Roman road used the gap. The road here forms the A5, which for national journeys has generally been superseded by the M1 motorway which also passes through this gap.

Later the road was joined by the Leicester Line of the Grand Union Canal, which passes through the Watford Locks just to the north of the gap.

The historical geographic importance of the area led to many modern communication routes passing through this narrow gap: the coming of the railways brought the London and Birmingham Railway, now known as the West Coast Main Line; the most recent addition, in 1959, was the M1, Britain&#x27;s first inter-urban motorway, bringing with it Watford Gap services, the first motorway service station.

==Division==
===Geological divide===
Topographically the gap is a pass caused by a tectonic plate shift, between east and west hill ranges. A tributary of the River Nene rises at Watford and flows east to the Wash, whereas at Kilsby a tributary of the River Leam rises and flows west.

===Sociological divide===
====Isogloss====

In linguistics the Watford Gap is often regarded as where England experiences its division of north and south dialects. It is close to the north/south isogloss of the three key hallmarks of Northern English and Southern English: foot–strut split, bad–lad split and the Bath vowel.

====North/South divide====
Making use of the above linguistic divide, authors, journalists and social commentators have written and spoken of a north–south divide between Northern England and Southern England, referring figuratively to Watford Gap as marking the boundary between the regions. 

The expression &quot;North of Watford&quot; is used to mean the north of England, especially a place remote from London. It is unknown whether the original expression referred to Watford, Northamptonshire, or the much larger Watford in Hertfordshire, the last urban stop on one of the main railway lines from London to the north of England. There is evidence to support the latter, as the phrase &quot;North of Watford Junction&quot; was used with similar meaning in the past, referring to Watford Junction railway station at Watford, Hertfordshire.

===Stagecoach route===
Historically, this was a junction of the West Midlands to London or East Anglia stagecoach routes across England. Its coaching inn, the Watford Gap, plied the passing trade of the area.

The pub, as well as the route from Cambridge to Coventry, is mentioned as early as 1769. This route ran through Northampton, Duston, Harlestone, past Althorp Park, Brington, Long Buckby, Watford, Watford Gap itself—the map indicating that the coaching inn was on the west side of Watling Street, and then into Kilsby. The route from Watford Gap to Kilsby is now part of the diverted A5 road following construction of the M1 motorway.

The location of the Watford Gap coaching inn is the subject of confusion, with a location on the east side of the Grand Junction Canal (within the confines of the modern service station) being the most frequently cited, near the disused Welton railway station. There is no mention of a Watford Gap pub or any other pub at the suggested location on the 1889 or 1927 or 1952 Ordnance Survey maps of Northamptonshire. The nearest pub was the now-closed Stag&#x27;s Head Inn in Station Road, Watford. The original location is further north on Watling Street. The canal-side building still stands but is closed for business and in poor repair. The earlier Watford Gap Inn is in good repair and generally unaltered, with the stabling yards and main structures used as farm buildings.

==Motorway service station==

The village is near to Watford Gap services on the M1 motorway, which was the first motorway service station in the United Kingdom.

==Cultural references==
Roy Harper&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Bullinamingvase&quot; contains a song titled &quot;Watford Gap&quot;. Motorway service areas, which have since undergone radical innovations, were at the time in the United Kingdom typecast as . The owners of Watford Gap services objected to his first reference to the place being (&quot;Watford Gap, Watford Gap / A plate of grease and a load of crap…&quot;). Harper was advised to drop the track from future UK copies of the album, though it reappeared on a CD reissue and remained on the American LP.

<doc id="446549" wikidata="Q1574706" url="?curid=446549" title="John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge">
<text>John Duke Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge (3 December 1820 – 14 June 1894) was an English lawyer, judge and Liberal politician. He held the posts, in turn, of Solicitor-General for England, Attorney-General for England, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Lord Chief Justice of England.

==Background and education==
Coleridge was the eldest son of John Taylor Coleridge, and the great-nephew of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, and was called to the bar in 1846.

Coleridge was a member of the Canterbury Association from 24 June 1851.

==Legal career==
Coleridge established a successful legal practice on the western circuit. From 1853 to 1854 he held the post of secretary to the Royal Commission on the City of London. In 1865 he was elected to the House of Commons for Exeter for the Liberal Party. He made a favourable impression on the leaders of his party and when the Liberals came to office in 1868 under William Ewart Gladstone, Coleridge was appointed Solicitor-General. In 1871 he was promoted to Attorney-General, a post he held until 1873. In 1871 he was also involved in the high-publicity Tichborne Case. In 1873 he was described by the Manchester-based &quot;Women&#x27;s Suffrage Journal&quot; as a &quot;firm and consistent&quot; supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage.

In November 1873 Coleridge succeeded Sir William Bovill as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and in January 1874 was raised to the peerage as Baron Coleridge, of Ottery St Mary in the County of Devon.

In 1875, the three English common law courts (the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court of the Exchequer) merged to become divisions of the new High Court of Justice. The head of each court (Lord Chief Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Lord Coleridge, and Chief Baron of the Exchequer Sir Fitzroy Kelly) continued in post. After the deaths of Kelly and Cockburn in 1880, the three divisions were merged into a single division, with Lord Coleridge as Lord Chief Justice of England. In 1884, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. Despite his health failing towards the end of his life he remained in this office until his death on 14 June 1894, aged 74, at his house in Sussex Square in Paddington.

==Family==

On 11 August 1846, Coleridge married Jane Fortescue Seymour, daughter of the Rev. George Turner Seymour of Freshwater, Isle of Wight, herself an accomplished artist who notably painted John Henry Newman. A short notice of her by Dean Church of St Paul&#x27;s was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and was reprinted in her husband&#x27;s privately printed collection of poems. They had three sons and a daughter:
* Mildred Mary Coleridge (1847–1929), married Charles Warren Adams
* Bernard John Seymour Coleridge (1851–1927), Liberal MP and judge of the High Court, succeeded as 2nd Baron Coleridge
* Stephen William Buchanan Coleridge (1854–1936), barrister, author and landscape artist
* Gilbert James Duke Coleridge (1859–1953), barrister and sculptor

His first wife died on 6 February 1878. He remained a widower until 13 August 1885, when he married Amy Augusta Jackson Lawford, daughter of Henry Baring Lawford, who survived him.

When Coleridge&#x27;s daughter Mildred went to live with the lawyer Charles Warren Adams – they married in 1885, Lord Coleridge refusing to attend the wedding – the family considered the match inappropriate. Mildred&#x27;s brother Bernard wrote her a letter disparaging Adams as a fortune hunter, which prompted Adams to sue for libel. The resultant legal proceedings in November 1884 and November 1886 were highly embarrassing for Lord Coleridge, who was obliged as Lord Chief Justice to appear in the court of which he was the senior judge.

<text>The Senegal thick-knee (Burhinus senegalensis) is a stone-curlew, a group of waders in the family Burhinidae. Their vernacular scientific name refers to the prominent joints in the long yellow or greenish legs.

==Range==
It is a resident breeder in Africa between the Sahara and the equator, and in the Nile valley.

==Description==

Senegal thick-knees are medium-large waders with strong black and yellow black bills, large yellow eyes — which give them a reptilian appearance — and cryptic plumage. They are similar but slightly smaller than the Eurasian stone-curlew, which winters in Africa. The long dark bill, single black bar on the folded wing, and darker cheek stripe are distinctions from the European species. Senegal thick-knee is striking in flight, with a broad white wing bar.

==Habits and food==

This species has a preference for dry open habitats with some bare ground, preferably near water. It lays two blotchy light brown eggs on a ground scrape. It is most active at dawn and dusk. The song is a loud &quot;pi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi&quot;.

Food is insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates. It will also take other small prey.

<doc id="446556" wikidata="Q841778" url="?curid=446556" title="Mahavishnu Orchestra">
<text>The Mahavishnu Orchestra was a jazz fusion band formed in New York City in 1971, led by English guitarist John McLaughlin. The group underwent several line-up changes throughout its history across its two periods of activity, from 1971 to 1976 and from 1984 to 1987. With its first line-up consisting of musicians Billy Cobham, Jan Hammer, Jerry Goodman, and Rick Laird, the band received its initial acclaim for its complex, intense music consisting of a blend of Indian classical music, jazz, and psychedelic rock as well as its dynamic live performances between 1971 and 1973. Many members of the band have gone on to acclaimed careers of their own in the jazz and jazz fusion genres.

== History ==
=== 1971–1974: First incarnation ===
By mid-1971, McLaughlin had been a member of Miles Davis&#x27; band and Tony Williams&#x27; Lifetime, and released three solo albums. He then set about forming his own jazz fusion group, the first line-up of which featured Panamanian drummer Billy Cobham, Irish bassist Rick Laird, Czech keyboardist Jan Hammer, and American violinist Jerry Goodman. Cobham and Goodman had played on McLaughlin&#x27;s third solo album &quot;My Goal&#x27;s Beyond&quot; (1971). McLaughlin&#x27;s first choice for violinist was Frenchman Jean-Luc Ponty, but he was unable to join due to immigration problems. After listening to various albums he hired Goodman, formerly of The Flock. Though American bassist Tony Levin was the first person McLaughlin wanted, Laird had known McLaughlin for several years and accepted the invitation. Hammer was found through a mutual friendship with Miroslav Vitous of the jazz fusion group Weather Report. The group&#x27;s name originates from Indian spiritual leader and guru Sri Chinmoy, of whom McLaughlin had become a follower, who gave him the name Mahavishnu, &quot;Maha&quot; meaning &quot;great&quot; in Sanskrit and &quot;vishnu&quot; after the Hindu deity Vishnu.

With the line-up secured, the five met in New York City in July 1971 and rehearsed for one week. They adopted an instrumental fusion sound characterised by electric rock, funk, complex time signatures, and arrangements influenced by McLaughlin&#x27;s interest in Indian classical music. Their debut gigs followed at the Gaslight at the Au Go Go as the opening act for bluesman John Lee Hooker. McLaughlin recalled: &quot;The first set was shaky but the second set just took off and every night it was great. They wanted to hold us over and a few days after the second week ... we went into the studio&quot;. McLaughlin secured a record deal with Columbia Records, giving the green light to record an album.
&quot;The Inner Mounting Flame&quot; was released in November 1971, peaking at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Jazz Albums and No. 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. This was followed by &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; (1973). Due to the pressures of sudden fame, exhaustion and a lack of communication, the original band began to tire. The stress was further exacerbated by problematic recording sessions in June 1973 at London&#x27;s Trident Studios that found some of the players not speaking to others. Their project was never fully completed. Cobham was disappointed and felt that the group &quot;were knocking on the door of something really new. Something unique, something that had never been done before in rock and roll.&quot; This was followed by the release of their first live album &quot;Between Nothingness &amp; Eternity&quot;, which featured material from the Trident sessions.

Later in 1973, Hammer and Goodman expressed their frustrations about McLaughlin&#x27;s leadership in an interview for &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; magazine. An attempt was made to improve group relations by having each member introduced as they walked on stage, and tunes by Hammer, Laird, and Goodman mixed into the live set. It was not enough, however, and the five played their final gig on December 30. According to Laird, the band did not say goodbye to each other afterward. In January 1974, McLaughlin split the group. Laird spoke about the group weeks later, claiming that despite McLaughlin&#x27;s having composed most of the group&#x27;s tunes, the rest of the band contributed &quot;a great deal&quot; and did not receive credit. He was also critical of Cobham&#x27;s claim that the group had rejected his musical ideas, and that Hammer, Goodman, and Laird pushed to have their songs performed because of &quot;an ego trip&quot;.

=== 1974–1976: Second incarnation ===
After the original group dissolved, it reformed in 1974 with a new cast of musicians behind McLaughlin: Jean-Luc Ponty (who had performed with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention) on violin, Gayle Moran on keyboards, Ralphe Armstrong on bass, and Narada Michael Walden on percussion, Steve Kindler and Carol Shive on violin, Marcia Westbrook on viola, Phil Hirschi on cello, Steve Frankevich, Premik Russell Tubbs on alto, tenor and soprano saxophones,and Bob Knapp on brass. This &quot;new&quot; Mahavishnu Orchestra (which McLaughlin has reportedly called the &quot;real&quot; Mahavishnu Orchestra) changed personnel slightly between 1974&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Visions of the Emerald Beyond&quot; in 1975. &quot;Apocalypse&quot; was recorded in London with the London Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas, with George Martin producing and Geoff Emerick engineering the sessions. The band was then reduced to a four-piece for 1976&#x27;s &quot;Inner Worlds&quot;, with Jean-Luc Ponty leaving after a heated disagreement about writing credits on the &quot;Visions&quot; album (one of Ponty&#x27;s compositions, Pegasus, was mistakenly credited to John McLaughlin), and Gayle Moran being replaced with Stu Goldberg. Ponty would later settle over the royalties for the tracks &quot;Pegasus&quot; and &quot;Opus 1&quot; for an undisclosed amount of money.

=== 1984–1987: Third incarnation ===
After the dissolution of this version of the Orchestra, McLaughlin formed another group called Shakti to explore his interest in Indian music; following that, he went on to form other bands including the One Truth Band and the Translators, and a guitar trio with Al Di Meola and flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía.

In 1984, McLaughlin reformed the Mahavishnu Orchestra with Bill Evans on saxophones, Jonas Hellborg on bass, Mitchel Forman on keyboards, and original member Billy Cobham on drums. Cobham participated in the sessions for their self-titled 1984 album, but was replaced by Danny Gottlieb for live work, and Jim Beard replaced Mitchel Forman for the latter period of this band&#x27;s life. This band&#x27;s overall sound was different from the original Mahavishnu Orchestra, in particular because of McLaughlin&#x27;s extensive use of the Synclavier synthesizer system.

=== Post-Mahavishnu Orchestra ===
McLaughlin then worked with a number of incarnations of the John McLaughlin Guitar Trio, all of which featured Trilok Gurtu on percussion, and, at various times, Jeff Berlin, Kai Eckhardt, and Dominique Di Piazza on bass. He then formed the Free Spirits, a guitar, organ and drums trio, with Joey DeFrancesco on Hammond organ and trumpet, and Dennis Chambers on drums, as well as touring and recording again with Al Di Meola and Paco de Lucía.

Billy Cobham went on to perform as a solo artist, recording many albums including &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Crosswinds&quot; and &quot;Spectrum&quot;, and toured with the &quot;Billy Cobham &amp; George Duke Band&quot; for many years. Jan Hammer went on to collaborate with Jeff Beck (together with Narada Michael Walden) in Beck&#x27;s acclaimed album &quot;Wired&quot; and also recorded a live album with Beck. He released several solo albums and composed the theme and incidental music for the hit 1980s TV show &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Jerry Goodman recorded the album &quot;Like Children&quot; with Mahavishnu keyboard alumnus Jan Hammer. Starting in 1985 he recorded three solo albums for Private Music and went on tour with his own band, as well as with Shadowfax and the Dixie Dregs. Rick Laird played with Stan Getz and Chick Corea as well as releasing one solo LP, &quot;Soft Focus&quot;, but retired from the music business in 1982. He had worked both as a bass teacher and photographer since then. He died on July 4, 2021, at the age of 80.

== Legacy ==
Mahavishnu Orchestra has been cited as an influence on many bands of different genres. Greg Ginn, guitarist and main composer of hardcore punk band Black Flag, cited their early records which inspired him to record more progressive guitar work and even record instrumental albums. There has been a resurgence of interest in the Mahavishnu Orchestra in recent years, with bands like The Mars Volta, Opeth, Black Midi, and the Dillinger Escape Plan, naming them as an influence. Jon Fishman, the drummer for Phish has also cited them as an influence. There have been no less than five major tribute recordings released. In addition, a book &quot;Power, Passion and Beauty: The Story of the Legendary Mahavishnu Orchestra&quot; by Walter Kolosky (AbstractLogix Books) has been published. It contains interviews with all of the band&#x27;s members and quotes obtained specifically for the book from many famous admirers such as Jeff Beck, Pat Metheny, the artist Peter Max, Bill Bruford and many more. The Mahavishnu Orchestra have also been sampled in contemporary music, most notably by Massive Attack on their track &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot;, which sampled &quot;Planetary Citizen&quot;, resulting in the band&#x27;s being sued by Ralphe Armstrong, who received a healthy out-of-court settlement. &quot;You Know, You Know&quot; was sampled on Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;One Love&quot; and Mos Def&#x27;s &quot;Kalifornia.&quot;

<text>Solo Man (Homo erectus soloensis) is a subspecies of &quot;H. erectus&quot; that lived along the Solo River in Java, Indonesia, about 117,000 to 108,000 years ago in the Late Pleistocene. This population is the last known record of the species. It is known from 14 skullcaps, two tibiae, and a piece of the pelvis excavated near the village of Ngandong, and possibly three skulls from Sambungmacan and a skull from Ngawi depending on classification. The Ngandong site was first excavated from 1931 to 1933 under the direction of Willem Frederik Florus Oppenoorth, Carel ter Haar, and Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald, but further study was set back by the Great Depression, World War II and the Indonesian War of Independence. In accordance with historical race concepts, Indonesian &quot;H. erectus&quot; subspecies were originally classified as the direct ancestors of Aboriginal Australians, but Solo Man is now thought to have no living descendants because the remains far predate modern human immigration into the area, which began roughly 55,000 to 50,000 years ago.

The Solo Man skull is oval-shaped in top view, with heavy brows, inflated cheekbones, and a prominent bar of bone wrapping around the back. The brain volume was quite large, measuring from , which is within the range of variation for present-day modern humans. One potentially female specimen may have been tall and weighed ; males were probably much bigger than females. Solo Man was in many ways similar to the Java Man (&quot;H. e. erectus&quot;) that had earlier inhabited Java, but was far less archaic.

Solo Man likely inhabited an open woodland environment much cooler than present-day Java, along with elephants, tigers, wild cattle, water buffalo, tapirs, and hippopotamuses, among other megafauna. They manufactured simple flakes and choppers (hand-held stone tools), and possibly spears or harpoons from bones, daggers from stingray stingers, as well as bolas or hammerstones from andesite. They may have descended from or were at least closely related to Java Man. The Ngandong specimens likely died during a volcanic eruption. The species probably went extinct with the takeover of tropical rainforest and loss of preferred habitat, beginning by 125,000 years ago. The skulls sustained damage, but it is unclear if it resulted from an assault, cannibalism, the volcanic eruption, or the fossilisation process.

==Research history==
Despite what English naturalist Charles Darwin had hypothesised in his 1871 book &quot;Descent of Man&quot;, many late-19th century evolutionary naturalists postulated that Asia, not Africa, was the birthplace of humankind as it is midway between Europe and America, providing optimal dispersal routes throughout the world (the Out of Asia theory). Among these was German naturalist Ernst Haeckel who argued that the first human species (which he named &quot;Homo primigenius&quot;) evolved on the now-disproven hypothetical continent &quot;Lemuria&quot; in what is now Southeast Asia, from a genus he termed &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; (&quot;ape-man&quot;). &quot;Lemuria&quot; had supposedly sunk below the Indian Ocean, so no fossils could be found to prove this. Nevertheless, Haeckel&#x27;s model inspired Dutch scientist Eugène Dubois to join the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) and search for his &quot;missing link&quot; in the Indonesian Archipelago. On Java, he found a skullcap and a femur (Java Man) dating to the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene at the Trinil site along the Solo River, which he named &quot;P.&quot; &quot;erectus&quot; (using Haeckel&#x27;s hypothetical genus name) in 1893. He attempted unsuccessfully to convince the European scientific community that he had found an upright-walking ape-man. They largely dismissed his findings as a malformed non-human ape.

The &quot;apeman of Java&quot; nonetheless stirred up academic interest and, to find more remains, the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin tasked German zoologist Emil Selenka with continuing the excavation of Trinil. Following his death in 1907, excavation was carried out by his wife and fellow zoologist Margarethe Lenore Selenka. Among the members was Dutch geologist Willem Frederik Florus Oppenoorth. The yearlong expedition was unfruitful, but the Geological Survey of Java continued to sponsor the excavation along the Solo River. Some two decades later, the Survey funded several expeditions to update maps of the island. Oppenoorth was made the head of the Java Mapping Program in 1930. One of their missions was to firmly distinguish Tertiary and Quaternary deposits, among the relevant sites a bed dating to the Pleistocene discovered by Dutch geologist Carel ter Haar in 1931, downriver from the Trinil site, near the village of Ngandong.
From 1931 to 1933, 12 human skull pieces (including well-preserved skullcaps), as well as two right tibiae (shinbones), one of which was essentially complete, were recovered under the direction of Oppenoorth, ter Haar, and German-Dutch geologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald. Midway through excavation, Oppenoorth retired from the Survey and returned to the Netherlands, replaced by Polish geologist in 1933. At the same time, because of the Great Depression, the Survey&#x27;s focus shifted to economically relevant geology, namely petroleum deposits, and the excavation of Ngandong ceased completely. In 1934, ter Haar published important summaries of the Ngandong operations before contracting tuberculosis. He returned to the Netherlands and died two years later. Von Koenigswald, who was hired principally to study Javan mammals, was fired in 1934. After much lobbying by Zwierzycki in the Survey, and after receiving funding from the Carnegie Institution for Science, von Koenigswald regained his position in 1937, but was too preoccupied with the Sangiran site to continue research at Ngandong.

In 1935, the Solo Man remains were transported to Batavia (today, Jakarta, Java, Indonesia) in the care of local university professor Willem Alphonse Mijsberg, with the hope he would take over study of the specimens. Before he had the opportunity, the fossils were moved to Bandung, West Java in 1942 because of the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. Japanese forces interned von Koenigswald for 32 months. At the cessation of the war, he was released, but the Indonesian War of Independence erupted. Jewish-German anthropologist Franz Weidenreich (who fled China before the Japanese invasion in 1941) arranged with the Rockefeller Foundation and The Viking Fund for von Koenigswald, his wife Luitgarde, and the Javan human remains (including Solo Man) to come to New York. Von Koenigswald and Weidenreich studied the material at the American Museum of Natural History until Weidenreich&#x27;s death in 1948 (leaving behind a monograph on Solo Man posthumously published in 1951). In his 1956 book &quot;Meeting Prehistoric Men&quot;, von Koenigswald included a 14-page account of the Ngandong project with several unpublished results. The Solo Man remains came to be stored at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. In 1967, von Koenigswald gave the material to Teuku Jacob for his doctoral research. Jacob oversaw the excavation of Ngandong from 1976 to 1978 and recovered two more skull specimens and a pelvic fragment. In 1978, von Koenigswald returned the material to Indonesia, and the Solo Man remains were moved to the Gadjah Mada University, Special Region of Yogyakarta (south-central Java).
The specimens are:
* Skull I, an almost complete skullcap probably belonging to an elderly female;
* Skull II, a frontal bone probably belonging to a three to seven-year-old child;
* Skull III, a warped skullcap probably belonging to an elderly individual;
* Skull IV, a skullcap probably belonging to a middle-aged female;
* Skull V, a probable male skullcap—indicated by its great length of ;
* Skull VI, an almost complete skullcap probably belonging to an adult female;
* Skull VII, a right parietal bone fragment probably belonging to a young, possibly female, individual;
* Skull VIII, both parietal bones (separated) possibly belonging to a young male;
* Skull IX, a skullcap missing the base probably belonging to an elderly individual (the small size is consistent with a female, but the heaviness is consistent with a male);
* Skull X, a shattered skullcap probably belonging to a robust elderly female;
* Skull XI, a nearly complete skullcap;
* Tibia A, a few fragments of the shaft, measuring in diameter at the mid-shaft, probably belonging to an adult male;
* Tibia B, a nearly complete right tibia measuring in length at in diameter at the mid-shaft, probably belonging to an adult female;
* Ngandong 15, a partial skullcap;
* Ngandong 16, a left parietal fragment; and
* Ngandong 17, a left acetabulum (on the pelvis which forms part of the hip joint).

==Age and taphonomy==
The location of these fossils in the Solo terrace at the time of discovery was poorly documented. Oppenoorth, ter Haar, and von Koenigswald were only on site for 24 days of the 27 months of operation as they needed to oversee other Tertiary sites for the Survey. They left their geological assistants — Samsi and Panudju — to oversee the dig; their records are now lost. The Survey&#x27;s site map remained unpublished until 2010 (over 75 years later) and is of limited use now, so the taphonomy and geological age of Solo Man have been contentious matters. All 14 specimens were reported to have been found in the upper section of Layer II (of six layers), which is a -thick stratum with gravelly sand and volcaniclastic hypersthene andesite. They are thought to have been deposited at around the same time, probably in a now-dry arm of the Solo River, about above the modern river. The site is about above sea level.
Volcaniclastic rock indicates deposition occurred soon after a volcanic eruption. Because of the sheer volume of fossils, humans and animals may have concentrated in great numbers in the valley upstream from the site due to the eruption or extreme drought. The ash would have poisoned the vegetation, or at least impeded its growth, leading to starvation and death among herbivores and humans, accumulating a mass of carcasses decomposing over several months. A lack of carnivore damage may indicate sufficient feeding was possible without having to resort to crunching through the bone. When the monsoon season came, lahars streaming from the volcano through the river channels swept the carcasses to the Ngandong site, where they and other debris created a jam because of the channel narrowing there. The &quot;H. erectus&quot; fossils from Sambungmacan, also along the Solo River, were possibly deposited in the same event.

The dating attempts are:
* In 1932, based on the site&#x27;s height above the present-day river, Oppenoorth suggested Solo Man dated to the Eemian interglacial, which at the time was roughly constrained to 150 to 100 thousand years ago from the Middle/Late Pleistocene transition. Later biochronological studies (using the animal remains to constrain the age) within the next few years by Oppenoorth in 1932, von Koenigswald in 1934, and ter Haar in 1936 agreed with a Late Pleistocene date.
* The Solo Man remains were first radiometrically dated in 1988 and again in 1989, using uranium–thorium dating, to 200 to 30 thousand years ago, a wide error range.
* In 1996, Solo Man teeth were dated, using electron spin resonance dating (ESR) and uranium–thorium isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, to 53.3 to 27 thousand years ago; this would mean Solo Man outlasted continental &quot;H. erectus&quot; by at minimum 250,000 years and was contemporaneous with modern humans in Southeast Asia, who immigrated roughly 55 to 50 thousand years ago.
* In 2008, gamma spectroscopy on three of the skulls showed they experienced uranium leaching, and the Solo Man remains were re-dated to roughly 70 to 40 thousand years ago. This would still make it possible Solo Man was contemporaneous with modern humans.
* In 2011, argon–argon dating of pumice hornblende yielded a maximum age of 546 ± 12 thousand years ago, and ESR and uranium–thorium dating of a mammal bone just downstream at the Jigar I site a minimum age of 143 to 77 thousand years ago. This extended interval would make it possible Solo Man was contemporaneous with continental &quot;H. erectus&quot;, long before modern humans dispersed across the continent.
* In 2020, the first comprehensive chronology of the Ngandong site was published which found the Solo River was diverted through the site 500,000 years ago; the Solo terrace was deposited over 316 to 31 thousand years ago; the Ngandong terrace 141 to 92 thousand years ago; and the &quot;H. erectus&quot; bone bed 117 to 108 thousand years ago. This would mean Solo Man is indeed the last known &quot;H. erectus&quot; population and did not interact with modern humans.

==Classification==
===Multiregional model===

The racial classification of Aboriginal Australians, because of the robustness of the skull compared to that of other modern-day populations, has historically been a complicated question for European science since Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (the founder of physical anthropology) introduced the topic in 1795 in his &quot;De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa&quot; (&quot;On the Natural History of Mankind&quot;). Following the conception of evolution by Darwin, English anthropologist Thomas Henry Huxley suggested an ancestor–descendant relationship between European Neanderthals and Aboriginal Australians in 1863, which was furthered by later racial anthropologists until the discovery of Indonesian archaic humans.

In 1932, Oppenoorth preliminarily drew parallels between the Solo Man skull and that of Rhodesian Man from Africa, Neanderthals, and modern day Aboriginal Australians. At the time, humans were generally believed to have originated in Central Asia, as championed primarily by American palaeontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn and his protégé William Diller Matthew. They believed Asia was the &quot;mother of continents&quot; and the rising of the Himalayas and Tibet and subsequent drying of the region forced human ancestors to become terrestrial and bipedal. They maintained that populations which retreated to the tropics – namely Dubois&#x27;s Java Man and the &quot;Negroid race&quot; — substantially regressed (degeneration theory). They also rejected Raymond Dart&#x27;s South African Taung child (&quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;) as a human ancestor, favouring the hoax Piltdown Man from Britain. At first, Oppenoorth believed the Ngandong material represented an Asian type of Neanderthal which was more closely allied with the Rhodesian Man (also considered a Neanderthal type), and gave it a generic distinction as &quot;&quot;Javanthropus soloensis&quot;. Dubois considered Solo Man to be more or less identical to the East Javan Wajak Man (now classified as a modern human), so Oppenoorth subsequently began using the name &quot;Homo (Javanthropus) soloensis&quot;&quot;. Oppenoorth hypothesised that the Java Man evolved in Indonesia and was the predecessor of modern day Aboriginal Australians, Solo Man being a transitional fossil. He considered Rhodesian Man a member of this same group. As for the Chinese Peking Man (now &quot;H. e. pekinensis&quot;), he believed it dispersed west and gave rise to the Neanderthals.

Thus, the ancient Java Man, Solo Man, and Rhodesian Man were commonly grouped together in the &quot;Pithecanthropoid-Australoid&quot; lineage. &quot;Australoid&quot; includes Aboriginal Australians and Melanesians. This was an extension of the multiregional origin of modern humans championed by Weidenreich and American racial anthropologist Carleton S. Coon, who believed that all modern races and ethnicities (which were classified into separate subspecies or even species until the mid-20th century) evolved independently from a local archaic human species (polygenism). Aboriginal Australians were considered the most primitive race alive. In the 1950s, German evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr entered the field of palaeoanthropology, and, surveying a &quot;bewildering diversity of names&quot;, decided to define only three species of &quot;Homo&quot;: &quot;H. transvaalensis&quot; (the australopithecines), &quot;H. erectus&quot; (including Solo Man and several putative African and Asian taxa), and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (including anything younger than &quot;H. erectus&quot;, such as modern humans and Neanderthals). Mayr defined them as a sequential lineage, each species evolving into the next (chronospecies). Though Mayr later changed his opinion on the australopithecines (recognising &quot;Australopithecus&quot;), and a few species have since been named or regained some acceptance, his more conservative view of archaic human diversity became widely adopted in the subsequent decades.

Though Mayr did not expand upon the subspecies of &quot;H. erectus&quot;, subsequent authors began formally sinking species from all parts of the Old World into it. Solo Man was placed into the &quot;Neanderthal/Neanderthalien/Neanderthaloid group&quot; by Weidenreich in the 1940s, which he reserved for specimens apparently transitional between &quot;H. erectus&quot; and &quot;H. sapiens&quot;. The group could also be classified under the now-defunct genus &quot;Palaeoanthropus&quot;. Solo man was first classified as a subspecies of &quot;H. erectus&quot; by Coon in his 1962 book &quot;The Origin of Races&quot;.

===Assimilation model===

The claim that Aboriginal Australians were descended from Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot; was expanded upon in the 1960s and 1970s as some of the oldest known (modern) human fossils were being recovered from Australia, primarily under the direction of Australian anthropologist Alan Thorne. He noted some populations were prominently more robust than others, so he suggested Australia was colonised in two waves (&quot;di-hybrid model&quot;): the first wave being highly robust and descending from nearby &quot;H. erectus&quot;, and the second wave more gracile (less robust) and descending from anatomically modern East Asians (who, in turn, descended from Chinese &quot;H. erectus&quot;). It was subsequently discovered that some of the more robust specimens are geologically younger than the gracile ones.

By the 1980s, as African species like &quot;A. africanus&quot; became widely accepted as human ancestors and race became less salient in anthropology, the Out of Africa theory overturned the Out of Asia and multiregional models. The multiregional model was consequently reworked into local populations of archaic humans having interbred and contributed at least some ancestry to modern populations in their respective regions, otherwise known as the assimilation model. Solo Man fits into this by having hybridised with the fully modern ancestors of Aboriginal Australians travelling south through Southeast Asia. The assimilation model was not ubiquitously supported.

In 2006, Australian palaeoanthropologist Steve Webb speculated instead that Solo Man was the first human species to reach Australia, and more robust modern Australian specimens represent hybrid populations.

===Present===
The date of 117 to 108 thousand years ago for Solo Man, predating modern human dispersal through Southeast Asia (and eventually into Australia), is at odds with this conclusion. Such an ancient date leaves Solo Man with no living descendants. Similarly, a 2021 genomic study looking at the genomes of over 400 modern humans (of which 200 came from Island Southeast Asia) found no evidence of any &quot;super-archaic&quot; (i. e. &quot;H. erectus&quot;) introgression.

Solo Man has generally been considered to have descended from Java Man (&quot;H. e. erectus&quot;, typified by the Sangiran/Trinil populations), and the three skulls from Sambungmacan and the skull from Ngawi have been assigned to &quot;H. e. soloensis&quot; or some intermediary stage between &quot;H. e. erectus&quot; and &quot;H. e. soloensis&quot;. It is largely unclear if there was gene flow from the continent. The alternate hypothesis, first proposed by Jacob in 1973, is that the Sangiran/Trinil and Ngandong/Ngawi/Sambungmacan populations were sister groups that evolved parallel to each other. If the alternate is correct, this could warrant species distinction as &quot;H. soloensis&quot;, but the definitions of species and subspecies, especially in palaeoanthropology, are poorly drawn.

==Anatomy==

The identification as adult or juvenile was based on the closure of the cranial sutures, assuming they closed at a rate similar to modern humans (though they may have closed at earlier ages in &quot;H. erectus&quot;). Characteristic of &quot;H. erectus&quot;, the skull is exceedingly thick in Solo Man, ranging from double to triple what would be seen in modern humans. Male and female specimens were distinguished by assuming males were more robust than females, though both males and females are exceptionally robust compared to other Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot;. The adult skulls average in length times breadth, and are proportionally similar to that of the Peking Man but have a much larger circumference. Skull V is the longest at . For comparison, the dimensions of modern human skulls average for men and for women.

The Solo Man remains are characterised by more derived traits than more archaic Javan &quot;H. erectus&quot;, most notably a larger brain size, an elevated cranial vault, reduced postorbital constriction, and less developed brow ridges. They still closely resemble earlier &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Like Peking Man, there was a slight sagittal keel running across the midline of the skull. Compared to other Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot;, the forehead is proportionally low and also has a low angle of inclination. The brow ridges do not form a continuous bar like in Peking Man, but curve downwards at the midpoint, forming a nasal bridge. The brows are quite thick, especially at the lateral ends (nearest the edge of the face). Like Peking Man, the frontal sinuses are confined to between the eyes rather than extending into the brow region. Compared to Neanderthals and modern humans, the area the temporal muscle would have covered is rather flat. The brow ridges merge into markedly thickened cheek bones. The skull is phenozygous, in that the skullcap is proportionally narrow compared to the cheekbones, so that the latter are still visible when looking down at the skull in top-view. The squamous part of the temporal bone is triangular like that of Peking Man, and the infratemporal crest is quite sharp. Like earlier Javan &quot;H. erectus&quot;, the inferior and superior temporal lines (on the parietal bone) diverge towards the back of the skull.

At the back of the skull, there is a sharp, thick occipital torus (a projecting bar of bone) which marks a clear separation between the occipital and nuchal planes. The occipital torus projects the most at the part corresponding to the external occipital protuberance in modern humans. The base of the temporal bone is consistent with Java Man and Peking Man rather than Neanderthals and modern humans. Unlike Neanderthals and modern humans, there is a defined bony pyramid structure near the root of the pterygoid bone. The mastoid part of the temporal bone at the base of the skull notably juts out. The occipital condyles (which connect the skull to the spine) are proportionally small compared to the foramen magnum (where the spinal cord passes into the skull). Large, irregular bony projections lie directly behind the occipital condyles.

The brain volumes of the six Ngandong specimens for which the metric is calculable range from . The Ngawi I skull measures ; and the three Sambungmacan skulls . This makes for an average of over . Overall, Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot; are big-brained, averaging roughly . For comparison, a 1955 survey of 63 Aboriginal Australians reported a brain volume range of ; that is, Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot; brain volume fits within the modern human range of variation. The base of the braincase, and thus the brain, seems to have been flat rather than curved. The sella turcica at the base of the skull, near the pituitary gland, is much larger than that of modern humans, which Weidenreich in 1951 cautiously attributed to an enlarged gland which caused the extraordinary thickening of the bones.

Of the two known tibiae, Tibia A is much more robust than Tibia B and is consistent overall with Neanderthal tibiae. Like other &quot;H. erectus&quot;, the tibiae are thick and heavy. Based on the reconstructed length of , Tibia B may have belonged to a tall, individual. Tibia A is assumed to have belonged to a larger individual. Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot;, for which height estimates are taken (a rather small sample size), typically range from , with Indonesian &quot;H. erectus&quot; in tropical environments typically scoring on the higher end, and continental specimens in colder latitudes on the lower end. The single pelvic fragment from Ngandong has not yet been described formally.

==Culture==
===Palaeohabitat===
At the species level, the Ngandong fauna is similar overall to the older Kedung Brubus fauna roughly 800 to 700 thousand years ago, a time of mass immigration of large mammal species to Java, including Asian elephants and &quot;Stegodon&quot;. Other Ngandong fauna include the tiger &quot;Panthera tigris soloensis&quot;, Malayan tapir, the hippo &quot;Hexaprotodon&quot;, sambar deer, water buffalo, the cow &quot;Bos palaesondaicus&quot;, pigs, and crab-eating macaque. These are consistent with an open woodland environment. The presence of the common crane in the nearby contemporaneous Watualang site could indicate much cooler conditions than today. The driest conditions probably corresponded to the glacial maximum roughly 135,000 years ago, exposing the Sunda shelf and connecting the major Indonesian islands to the continent. By 125,000 years ago, the climate became much wetter, making Java an island, and allowing for the expansion of tropical rainforests. This caused the succession of the Ngandong fauna by the Punung fauna, which represents the modern day animal assemblage of Java, though more typical Punung fauna — namely orangutans and gibbons — probably could not penetrate the island until it was reconnected to the continent after 80,000 years ago. &quot;H. erectus&quot;, a specialist in woodland and savannah biomes, likely went extinct with the loss of the last open-habitat refugia.

&quot;H. e. soloensis&quot; was the last population of a long occupation history of the island of Java by &quot;H. erectus&quot;, beginning 1.51 to 0.93 million years ago at the Sangiran site, continuing 540 to 430 thousand years ago at the Trinil site, and finally 117 to 108 thousand years ago at Ngandong. If the date is correct for Solo Man, then they would represent a terminal population of &quot;H. erectus&quot; which sheltered in the last open-habitat refuges of East Asia before the rainforest takeover. Before the immigration of modern humans, Late Pleistocene Southeast Asia was also home to &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; endemic to the island of Flores, Indonesia, and &quot;H. luzonensis&quot; endemic to the island of Luzon, the Philippines. Genetic analysis of present-day Southeast Asian populations indicates the widespread dispersal of the Denisovans (a species currently recognisable only by their genetic signature) across Southeast Asia, whereupon they interbred with immigrating modern humans 45.7 and 29.8 thousand years ago. A 2021 genomic study indicates that, aside from the Denisovans, modern humans never interbred with any of these endemic human species, unless the offspring were unviable or the hybrid lineages have since died out.

Judging by the sheer number of specimens deposited at Ngandong at the same time, there may have been a sizeable population of &quot;H. e soloensis&quot; before the volcanic eruption which resulted in their interment, but population is difficult to approximate with certainty. The Ngandong site was some distance away from the northern coast of the island, but it is unclear where the southern shoreline and the mouth of the Solo River would have been.

===Technology===

In 1936, while studying photos taken by Dutch archaeologist , Oppenoorth made note of several broken animal bone remains, most notably damage to a large tiger skull and some deer antlers, which he considered evidence of bone technology. He suggested some deer antlers had a carved bird skull hafted onto the end to be used as axes. In 1951, Weidenreich voiced his scepticism—as the bones were invariably damaged by the river, and perhaps crocodiles and other natural processes—arguing instead that none of the bones reliably show any evidence of human modification. Oppenoorth further suggested a long piece of bone carved with an undulating pattern on both sides was used as a harpoon, similar to harpoons manufactured in the Magdalenian of Europe, but Weidenreich interpreted it as a spearhead. Weidenreich made note of anomalous inland stingray stingers at Ngandong, which he supposed were collected by Solo Man for use as daggers or arrowheads, similar to some recent South Pacific peoples. It is unclear if this apparent bone technology can be associated with Solo Man or later modern human activity, though the Trinil &quot;H. e. erectus&quot; population seems to have worked with such material, manufacturing scrapers from &quot;Pseudodon&quot; shells and possibly opening them up with shark teeth.

Oppenoorth also identified a perfectly round andesite stone ball from Ngandong, a common occurrence in the Solo Valley, ranging in diameter from . As well, similar balls have been identified in contemporaneous and younger European Mousterian and African Middle Stone Age sites, as ancient as African Acheulean sites (notably Olorgesailie, Kenya). On Java, they have been found at Watualang (contemporaneous with Ngandong) and Sangiran. Traditionally, these have been interpreted as bolas (tied together in twos or threes and flung as a hunting weapon), but also individually thrown projectiles, club heads, or plant-processing or bone-breaking tools. In 1993, American archaeologists Kathy Schick and Nicholas Toth demonstrated the spherical shape could be reproduced simply if the stone is used as a hammer for an extended period.

In 1938, von Koenigswald returned to the Ngandong site along with archaeologists Helmut de Terra, Hallam L. Movius and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin to collect lithic cores and flakes (i.e. stone tools). Because of wear caused by the river, it is difficult to identify with confidence that some of these rocks are actual tools. They are small and simple, usually smaller than and made most commonly of chalcedony (but also chert and jasper) washed up by the river. A few volcanic rocks and wood fragments seem to have been modified into heavy duty chopping tools. In 1973, the nearby Sambungmacan site yielded a unifacial chopper (as well as a flake) made of andesite. Because of how few tools have been recovered, it is impossible to categorise Solo Man into any distinct industry. Like many other Southeast Asian sites predating modern humans, the Ngandong site lacks sophisticated choppers, hand axes, or any other complex chopping tool characteristic of the Acheulean of Western Eurasian and African sites. In 1948, Movius suggested this was because of a great technological divide between western and eastern &quot;H. erectus&quot; (the &quot;Movius Line&quot;) caused by a major difference in habitat (open area vs. tropical rainforest), as the chopping tools are generally interpreted as evidence of big game hunting, which he believed was only possible when humans spread out onto open plains.
Though a strict &quot;Movius Line&quot; is not well supported anymore with the discovery of some hand axe technology in Middle Pleistocene East Asia, handaxes are still conspicuously rare and crude in East Asia compared to western contemporaries. This has been explained as: the Acheulean emerged in Africa after human dispersal through East Asia (but this would require that the two populations remained separated for nearly two million years); East Asia had poorer quality raw materials, namely quartz and quartzite (but some Chinese localities produced handaxes from these materials and East Asia is not completely void of higher-quality minerals); East Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot; used biodegradable bamboo instead of stone for chopping tools (but this is difficult to test); or East Asia had a lower population density, leaving few tools behind in general (though demography is difficult to approximate in the fossil record).

===Possible cannibalism===
In 1951, Weidenreich and von Koenigswald made note of major injuries in Skulls IV and VI, which they believed were caused by a cutting instrument and a blunt instrument, respectively. They bear evidence of inflammation and healing, so the individuals probably survived the altercation. Weidenreich and von Koenigswald noted that only the skullcaps were found, lacking even the teeth, which is highly unusual. So, they interpreted at least Skulls IV and VI as victims of an &quot;unsuccessful assault&quot;, and the other skulls where the base was broken out &quot;the result of more successful attempts to slay the victims,&quot; presuming this was done by other humans to access and consume the brain. They were unsure if this was done by a neighbouring &quot;H. e. soloensis&quot; tribe, or &quot;by more advanced human beings who would have given evidence of their &#x27;superior&#x27; culture by slaying their more primitive fellowsman&quot;. The latter scenario had already been proposed for the Peking Man (which has similarly conspicuous pathology) by French palaeontologist Marcellin Boule in 1937. Nonetheless, Weidenreich and von Koenigswald conceded that some of the injuries could have been related to the volcanic eruption instead. Von Koenigswald suggested only skullcaps exist because Solo Man was modifying skulls into skull cups, but Weidenreich was sceptical of this as the jagged rims of especially Skulls I, V, and X are not well suited for this purpose.

Cannibalism and ritual headhunting have also been proposed for the Trinil, Sangiran, and Modjokerto sites (all in Java) based on the conspicuous lack of any remains other than the skullcap. This had been reinforced by the historic practice of headhunting and cannibalism in some modern Indonesian, Australian, and Polynesian groups, which at the time were believed to have descended from these &quot;H. erectus&quot; populations. In 1972, Jacob alternatively suggested that because the base of the skull is weaker than the skullcap, and since the remains had been transported through a river with large stone and boulders, this was a purely natural phenomenon. As for the lack of the rest of the skeleton, if tiger predation was a factor, tigers usually only leave the head since it has the least amount of meat on it. Further, the Ngandong material, especially Skulls I and IX, were damaged during excavation, cleaning, and preparation.

<doc id="446561" wikidata="Q266737" url="?curid=446561" title="Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia">
<text>Boleslaus III ( – 1037), called the Red (; to denote a &quot;red-haired&quot; individual) or the Blind, a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 999 until 1002 and briefly again during the year 1003. During his chaotic reign, Bohemia became a pawn in the long German–Polish War between King Henry II and Duke Bolesław I, &quot;the Brave&quot;, of Poland.

==Life==
The eldest son of Duke Boleslaus II &quot;the Pious&quot;, probably with his first wife Adiva, he succeeded to the Bohemian throne upon the death of his father in 999. Boleslaus III turned out to be a weak ruler and soon entered into a fierce inheritance conflict with his younger brothers Jaromír and Oldřich. He had both expelled to the Bavarian court of Henry II in Regensburg, together with their mother Dowager Duchess Emma.

By 1002, a revolt organized by nobles of the rival Vršovci clan (along with Boleslaus&#x27;s son-in-law) forced him to flee to Germany, where he was received by Margrave Henry I of Austria. At first, Henry I ordered the arrest of his guest because of an old offence, but soon forgave him and promised support. Meanwhile, the Polish duke Bolesław I installed Boleslaus&#x27; kinsman Vladivoj on the Bohemian throne. Vladivoj was apparently an alcoholic, however, and died within a year. After the death of Vladivoj in 1003, the Bohemian nobles invited Jaromír and Oldřich back from exile. In turn, they each later assumed the throne at Prague.

On 9 February 1003, Boleslaus the Red was restored to authority with armed support from Duke Bolesław of Poland. Boleslaus&#x27;s brothers Jaromír and Oldřich again fled to Germany and placed themselves under the protection of Henry II. But Boleslaus soon undermined his own position by ordering a massacre of the nobles of the Vršovci clan at Vyšehrad. According to the chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, Boleslav slashed his son-in-law to death with his own sword.

Nobles who survived the massacre secretly sent messengers to Bolesław the Brave of Poland and entreated him to save them. The Polish duke willingly agreed and invited his Czech namesake to visit him at his castle (probably in Kraków). There, Boleslaus the Red was trapped, blinded and imprisoned. He never returned to Bohemia. Bolesław the Brave claimed the ducal throne for himself, invaded Bohemia in 1003 and took Prague without any serious opposition; he ruled as Duke Boleslaus IV for a little over a year. He then gave up his claim to the duchy of Bohemia and was replaced by Jaromír, who, backed by Henry II, entered through the Prague gates and in 1004 received the Bohemian duchy as a fief from the hands of the German king.

<doc id="446562" wikidata="Q778283" url="?curid=446562" title="Arturo Di Modica">
<text>Arturo Di Modica (January 26, 1941February 19, 2021) was an Italian sculptor, widely known for his &quot;Charging Bull&quot; sculpture.

English sculptor Henry Moore nicknamed Di Modica “the young Michelangelo” after they met in Italy in the 1960s.

==Early life==
Arturo Di Modica was born in Vittoria, a small town in the province of Ragusa, Sicily, on January 26, 1941. His father, Giuseppe, owned a grocery store and his mother, Angela, was a homemaker. Inspired by his surroundings, in 2017 Di Modica told an interviewer that as a child he had liked to hang out at the craftsmen&#x27;s workshops and watch them weaving baskets and carving wooden carts. As his father didn&#x27;t approve of him becoming an artist, Di Modica ran away from home at the age of 18, taking a train to Florence to pursue a career in sculpting.

Upon arrival in Florence, he enrolled in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze and attended courses in the Free School of the Nude for a few years. To support himself, he worked various jobs, including one in the x-ray department of a hospital and one as a mechanic in a local garage. Unable to afford the use of local foundries, he built his own forging and metalworking tools, salvaged materials, and cast bronzes in his home-built foundry.

==Career==
Di Modica had his first major show of rough abstract bronze castings at Villa Medici in 1968. By the late 1960s, Di Modica had begun working with Carrara marble in Pietrasanta, where he met English sculptor Henry Moore. Moore, who nicknamed Di Modica “the young Michelangelo”, would have a strong influence on Di Modica, who subsequently developed a new style. By 1970, Di Modica had grown frustrated with the limitations of Florence and felt he was not able to express his modernistic ideas. Upon the advice of his teachers, he moved to New York City.

===Arrival in New York (1970)===

Di Modica set up his first studio on Grand Street in SoHo, a neighborhood popular for its emerging bohemian art scene. Here, he became known for leaving large scale marble works on the street outside his studio. It was also at this address that Di Modica found a young graffiti artist, Jean-Michel Basquiat (also known as SAMO), spray painting his studio door.

===Rockefeller Center Installation (1977)===
In 1977, Di Modica held a major exhibition at Battery Park and invited art critic Hilton Kramer to the show. Uninterested, Kramer hung up on Di Modica, prompting Di Modica to illegally drop eight monumental abstract marble sculptures outside Rockefeller Center, blocking Fifth Avenue and drawing the attention of police. Surrounded by four police officers with their guns unholstered, Di Modica had yet to master the English language so instead he pushed a gun aside and handed over a flyer by way of explanation. Upon hearing about the commotion and interested to meet the artist, Mayor Abe Beame arrived and, after receiving a $25 fine, Di Modica was granted permission to temporarily leave the sculptures on exhibit. This stunt made the front page of the &quot;New York Post&quot; the next day and became a valuable learning experience for the artist. All eight sculptures were sold.
===54 Crosby Street===
Towards the end of the 1970s, Di Modica bought 54 Crosby Street, a vacant lot not far from his first studio. After tearing down the original shack, he built a new building using salvaged materials, completely to his own design and without planning permission. Among the materials he used were seven-meter beams of timber that he attached to himself and dragged back to Crosby Street through the streets at night, as well as 8,000 bricks that he bought for $400 from a priest. He would then go on to add two underground levels, again without the necessary permission, covertly removing the rubble under the cover of darkness. Crosby Street would become his creative center, where he lived, worked and hosted lively art parties and events.

===&quot;Il Cavallo&quot;, Lincoln Center (1988)===
During the 1970s, Di Modica&#x27;s focus was on abstract sculpture, often balancing opposing materials into a single work. However, this began to change in the early 1980s, when his focus turned to the equine form. A 1984 polished bronze horse on display in Trump Tower was followed by &quot;Il Cavallo&quot;, an almost 10.5 ft depiction of a horse biting its own tail. On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1988, Di Modica delivered the sculpture – wrapped in a red sheet with the message &quot;Be my Valentine NY Love AD&quot; – to Lincoln Center on the back of his Ferrari. Di Modica later sold a copy of the work to the Italian designer Roberto Cavalli.

===&quot;Charging Bull&quot; (1987–1989)===

On October 19, 1987, Black Monday hit U.S. financial markets and the country entered a very difficult period. Di Modica recounted that he felt indebted to the U.S. for welcoming him and enabling his success. Wanting to give something back, he conceived the &quot;Charging Bull&quot; sculpture. Di Modica spent the next two years creating the 16 ft bronze, reportedly financing the $350,000 cost himself. The sculpture was created in his Crosby Street studio and then cast using a local foundry. Once complete, Di Modica spent the next few nights watching the police patrols on Wall Street trying to find a window of opportunity. Before dawn on December 15, 1989, Di Modica arrived with a group of friends and the sculpture on the back of a truck to find a 40 ft Christmas tree had been installed during the day exactly where he wanted to place the sculpture. With only four minutes between the police patrols, he announced &quot;drop the bull under the tree – it&#x27;s my gift.&quot; The late night event went on to make news all around the world, including the front page of the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

Di Modica stayed by the sculpture to greet the morning commuters. However, while he was away for lunch, the New York Stock Exchange arranged for the sculpture to be removed. Due to public demand for the bull&#x27;s return, Parks Commissioner Henry Stern arranged for the sculpture&#x27;s installation at Bowling Green on December 20, where it can be found to this day.
Di Modica&#x27;s original concept was to inspire each person who came into contact with the sculpture to carry on fighting with strength and determination through the hard times for the future. While in conversation with art critic and writer Anthony Haden-Guest, Di Modica later explained:

My point was to show people that if you want to do something in a moment things are very bad, you can do it. You can do it by yourself. My point was that you must be strong.

==Representation==
For the majority of his career, Di Modica chose to work without representation and outside of the formal art market. In 2012, he began working with Jacob Harmer, a British art dealer. In 2020, Harmer published &quot;Arturo Di Modica: The Last Modern Master&quot; – a book on the life and works of the artist.

In the mid-2000s British businessman Joe Lewis bought the original &quot;Charging Bull&quot; statue for an undisclosed sum. A condition of the sale was that the statue stayed at Bowling Green. Lewis also commissioned the remainder of the sculptures within the edition, which had yet to be cast, and they are on display at several of his properties. In 2014, it was reported that Di Modica had been offered $12 million for a 16 ft platinum bull but the deal was never finalized. In October 2018, the first major work by Di Modica went to auction at Phillips London. The 6 ft polished bronze version of &quot;Charging Bull&quot; was the first in an edition of eight and marked &quot;1987–89&quot;. It sold for £309,000 ($405,000). In March 2019, a stainless steel version of &quot;Charging Bull&quot; went to auction at Sotheby&#x27;s New York and despite being in poor condition, sold for $275,000. His representative has confirmed that 4 ft sculptures have been sold for up to $496,000 as early as 2013.

==Later life and death==
In 2004, at the age of 63, Di Modica said: &quot;I have a lot of art to create. I have another 15, 20 years to do something beautiful.&quot; Not long after, Di Modica embarked upon two new projects simultaneously: the School of the New Renaissance and Wild Horses. The School of the New Renaissance is a 12-acre sculpture school in his home town of Vittoria. Di Modica believed it would become an international attraction capable of drawing in tourists from all over the world and helping the local economy. Wild Horses was an ambitious project: two 140 ft bronze horses straddling the Ippari River. Shortly before his death and despite his poor health, Di Modica had finished the 40 ft prototype.

Di Modica died on February 19, 2021, in his birthplace of Vittoria, Sicily having had cancer for a number of years. The day of Di Modica&#x27;s funeral was declared an official day of mourning and crowds of locals gathered outside the church, applauding as his coffin was carried out.
