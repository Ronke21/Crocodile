<doc id="456775" wikidata="Q11799408" url="?curid=456775" title="List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election">
<text>This is a list of members of Parliament (MPs) elected in the October 1974 general election, held on 10 October. This Parliament was dissolved in 1979.

==Composition==
These representative diagrams show the composition of the parties in the October 1974 general election.

Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sit together as a party group. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.
This is a list of Members of Parliament elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in October 1974 general election, held on 10 October. This was the second general election to be held that year. The Parliament lasted until 1979.

Notable newcomers to the House of Commons included Margaret Jackson (later Margaret Beckett), David Penhaligon, Bryan Gould, Margaret Bain (later Margaret Ewing), Helene Hayman and Ann Taylor.


==By-elections==
See the list of United Kingdom by-elections.

Four seats were vacant when Parliament was dissolved preparatory to the 1979 general election:
*Abingdon – Airey Neave (Con)
*Batley and Morley – Alfred Broughton (Lab)
*Chipping Barnet – Reginald Maudling (Con)
*North East Derbyshire – Tom Swain (Lab)

In addition, Maurice Orbach (Labour MP for Stockport South) died on 24 April, after dissolution but before the general election.

==Defections==
* 14 April 1976: John Stonehouse (Walsall North) defects from Labour to English National Party
* 26 July 1976: James Sillars (Ayrshire South) and John Robertson (Paisley) resign from Labour Party and sit as Scottish Labour
*1977–1978: The Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party fell apart. William Craig (East Belfast) and Robert Bradford (South Belfast) joined the Ulster Unionist Party. John Dunlop joined the United Ulster Unionist Party.
*1977: James Kilfedder (North Down) left the Ulster Unionist Party and sat as an independent unionist.

== Progression of government majority and party totals ==
The government voting total is the total number of Labour MPs, minus the Labour Deputy Speakers (two until 3 Feb 1976, one from that date). The opposition voting total is the total number of other MPs, minus the Speaker and the Conservative Deputy Speakers (one until 3 Feb 1976, two from that date). The majority is the difference between the former and the latter.

The Conservatives began with 276 MPs; the figure of 277 given above includes the Speaker Selwyn Lloyd.

In the Majority column, figures in brackets denote the majority the Lib-Lab pact had during its time of operation.</text><links>

<doc id="456778" wikidata="Q657108" url="?curid=456778" title="Coat of arms of Aruba">
<text>The Coat of arms of Aruba has been officially in use since November 15, 1955, as the recognized national symbol of Aruba.

== History ==
The (ERNA, English: Constitution of the Netherlands Antilles) established the autonomy of the various island territories in the Netherlands Antilles. The regulation was announced on March 3, 1951, by Royal Decree, four years before the Constitution of the Netherlands Antilles came into effect, and remained in force in modified form until the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved on October 10, 2010. 

On March 27, 1953, the Executive College of Aruba (Dutch: ) announced in the newspaper a competition to design a coat of arms for the island territory of Aruba. The College wanted to see an expression of the island&#x27;s autonomy, following the political decentralization of the Dutch Antilles in accordance with the ERNA in 1954. Aruba was the first of the Netherlands Antilles to use a coat of arms. The coat of arms was originally designed by the (Studio for Heraldic Arts), located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. On this design, however, the Government of Aruba made two changes with the approval of the Studio for Heraldic Arts to make it even more reflective of Aruba&#x27;s distinctive symbols. These changes are in the first and second quarters of the coat of arms, namely a sun and the peak of Jamanota, were changed to the &quot;Aloe vera&quot; and Hooiberg, respectively.
== Description ==

=== Blazon ===
The official description of the coat of arms:

Shield: &quot;quartered by a cross Argent, the first Azure an aloe plant Or, the second Or the Hooiberg hill Vert issuant from barry wavy sea of Azure and Argent, the third Or two dexter hands Gules shaking each other fesswise, the fourth Gules an Argent cogwheel&quot;

Crest: &quot;a lion couchant Gules&quot;

Supporters: &quot;a pair of laurel branches Vert, tied at the bottom&quot;

=== Symbolism ===
The coat of arms consists of seven main elements:

# Lion crest symbolizes power and generosity, emphasized through the color red.
# White Cross divides the shield into quarters, representing devotion and faith.
# First quarter: flowering aloe plant, symbolizing well-being and the island&#x27;s first significant export.
# Second quarter: Hooiberg, Aruba&#x27;s recognizable hill, represents Aruba rising out of the sea. Green signifies joy for autonomy, wavy lines depict the sea.
# Third quarter: hands shaking, symbolizing friendly relations with other nations and people in both the political and economic sectors. Red symbolizes generosity, modesty, and industriousness.
# Fourth quarter: cogwheel representing Aruba&#x27;s industry, the main source of livelihood.
#Below the shield, a pair of laurel branches tied at the bottom, symbolizing peace and friendship.

<doc id="456781" wikidata="Q2226624" url="?curid=456781" title="Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem">
<text>The [[Richard Bruck|Bruck]]–[[H. J. Ryser|Ryser]]–[[Sarvadaman Chowla|Chowla]] theorem is a result on the combinatorics of block designs that implies nonexistence of certain kinds of design. It states that if a (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, λ)-design exists with &quot;v = b&quot; (a symmetric block design), then: 
* if &quot;v&quot; is even, then &quot;k&quot; − λ is a square;
* if &quot;v&quot; is odd, then the following Diophantine equation has a nontrivial solution:
*: &quot;x&quot;2 − (&quot;k&quot; − λ)&quot;y&quot;2 − (−1)(v−1)/2 λ &quot;z&quot;2 = 0.

The theorem was proved in the case of projective planes by . It was extended to symmetric designs by .

== Projective planes ==
In the special case of a symmetric design with λ = 1, that is, a projective plane, the theorem (which in this case is referred to as the Bruck–Ryser theorem) can be stated as follows: If a finite projective plane of order &quot;q&quot; exists and &quot;q&quot; is congruent to 1 or 2 (mod 4), then &quot;q&quot; must be the sum of two squares. Note that for a projective plane, the design parameters are &quot;v&quot; = &quot;b&quot; = &quot;q&quot;2 + &quot;q&quot; + 1, &quot;r&quot; = &quot;k&quot; = &quot;q&quot; + 1, λ = 1. Thus, &quot;v&quot; is always odd in this case.

The theorem, for example, rules out the existence of projective planes of orders 6 and 14 but allows the existence of planes of orders 10 and 12. Since a projective plane of order 10 has been shown not to exist using a combination of coding theory and large-scale computer search, the condition of the theorem is evidently not sufficient for the existence of a design. However, no stronger general non-existence criterion is known.

== Connection with incidence matrices ==
The existence of a symmetric (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, λ)-design is equivalent to the existence of a &quot;v&quot; × &quot;v&quot; incidence matrix &quot;R&quot; with elements 0 and 1 satisfying

where is the &quot;v&quot; × &quot;v&quot; identity matrix and &quot;J&quot; is the &quot;v&quot; × &quot;v&quot; all-1 matrix. In essence, the Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem is a statement of the necessary conditions for the existence of a &quot;rational&quot; &quot;v&quot; × &quot;v&quot; matrix &quot;R&quot; satisfying this equation. In fact, the conditions stated in the Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem are not merely necessary, but also sufficient for the existence of such a rational matrix &quot;R&quot;. They can be derived from the Hasse–Minkowski theorem on the rational equivalence of quadratic forms.

<doc id="456788" wikidata="Q2233213" url="?curid=456788" title="Göppingen Gö 1">
<text>The Göppingen Gö 1 Wolf was a single-seat glider produced in Germany from 1935.

==Design and development==
Conceived as a rival to the Grunau Baby, it was the first product of the newly formed Sportflugzeugbau Göppingen Martin Schempp firm. It was a conventional, strut-braced high-wing design of wooden construction, incorporating a wheel aft of the loaded centre of gravity to ease ground handling, as well as aero-tow and winch launches.

Of very similar construction to the Grunau Baby, the Wolf had strut-braced high-set monoplane wings supported on a pylon aft of the cockpit. The hexagonal-section fuselage was constructed largely of wood with plywood skinning and the wings and tail surfaces were plywood-skinned back to the main spars with wooden-framed fabric-covered rear portions. The undercarriage consisted of rubber-sprung skids under the nose and tail with a fixed mainwheel aft of the loaded centre of gravity.

==Operational history==
Stressed for aerobatics, one example was purchased by Alan Cobham&#x27;s National Aviation Day displays, and was flown under tow directly to London by Joan Meakin. During early flying with the Wolf it gained a reputation for dangerous spinning characteristics, which resulted in the Gö 1 being grounded in 1938, pending incorporation of modified, longer-chord, slotted ailerons.

The cost of the required modifications proved uneconomic for the majority of owners and the majority of Gö 1s never flew again and only three are known to have survived in museums. 
One is still operational in Germany at Schempp-Hirth GmbH. On June 30, 2018, Tilo Holighaus made a 74 km cross country flight with it.

<doc id="456791" wikidata="Q7749735" url="?curid=456791" title="The Makioka Sisters (film)">
<text>is a 1983 drama film directed by Kon Ichikawa based on the 1957 serial novel of the same name by Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki. It depicts the pre-war lifestyle of the wealthy Makioka family from Osaka with parallels to the seasons in Japan.

==Plot==
The story takes place in Japan primarily during the late 1930s (Shōwa period). The sisters live in the Kansai area (Kobe/Osaka) and travel to Tokyo and other prefectures throughout the novel.

In the spring of 1938, the four sisters, along with Teinosuke, Sachiko&#x27;s husband, came to Kyoto to admire the cherry blossoms. Sachiko is unhappy that the elder sister Tsuruko, who is the heiress of the Makioka clan and therefore represents the main house of the clan, upset the matter with Yukiko&#x27;s marriage for the reason that a fatal flaw was discovered in the groom&#x27;s clan.

Five years ago, the youngest of the Taeko sisters ran away from home with Keizaburo Okuhata, the third son of the owner of the Okuhata jewelry store located in Semba, Osaka&#x27;s mall. One newspaper found out about this, but it mistakenly wrote the name of Yukiko instead of Taeko. Tatsuo, Tsuruko&#x27;s husband, who together with her represents the main house of the Makioka clan, demanded a refutation, but the newspaper only corrected its mistake, instead of Yukiko&#x27;s name, writing the name Taeko, which only aggravated the seriousness of the situation. Dissatisfied with this turn of affairs, Yukiko and Taeko refuse to live in the main house and move to the Sachiko house, which is a lateral branch of the Makioka clan.

Taeko starts making dolls. Her interest in Okuhata gradually fades and she grows closer to Itakura, who was previously an apprentice at Okuhata&#x27;s jewelry store, but now became a photographer. At this time, Yukiko&#x27;s bridegrooms are arranged with a bank broker, an employee of the prefectural council and the vice president of a pharmaceutical company, but they do not end in marriage, since Yukiko does not like the suitors. Itakura contracts an ear infection that leads to his sudden demise. And then Tatsuo comes home with the news that he is being transferred to Tokyo for work. Tsuruko is lost.

Yukiko is again offered a husband. This time the groom is a representative of the former aristocracy, the grandson of Viscount Higashidani. After Itakura&#x27;s death, Taeko began going to bars, trying to drown her grief. In one bar, she meets the bartender Miyoshi, leaves the house and moves in with him. Miyoshi turns out to be an honest and serious young man, and Taeko starts a new life with him, which reassures the sisters worried about her fate. Tsuruko, after much hesitation, finally decides to leave for Tokyo with her husband. Yukiko is also doing well with Mr. Higashidani, they decide to get married.

On a winter&#x27;s day at Osaka Station, Yukiko, Teinosuke and the others say goodbye to Tsuruko and her family who are leaving for Tokyo. Sachiko, however, decides not to see her off, thinking the pair would cry and embarrass themselves. Instead, she visits Taeko at her new home, and the two share tea and watch the falling snow.

==Cast==

* Keiko Kishi - Tsuruko Makioka: The eldest Makioka sister is described as being phlegmatic, and most of her voice throughout the novel is heard through letters she sends to her sisters. Tsuruko lives in the &quot;main&quot; Makioka house in Osaka, and is not only removed physically from her sisters, who live in a branch house in Ashiya, but also seems to be removed emotionally.
* Yoshiko Sakuma - Sachiko Makioka: The second eldest Makioka sister who is the mistress of the branch house in Ashiya. Sachiko is good-tempered and indulgent of her younger sisters, who live with her instead of, as tradition would have it, with Tsuruko.
* Sayuri Yoshinaga - Yukiko Makioka: Melancholy Yukiko is still unmarried at 30, because, when the Makioka family was in its heyday, all of her marriage proposals were turned down as not being good enough. Now, with the family in decline, marriage opportunities are much more scarce, and Yukiko&#x27;s stoicity and shyness do nothing to incite her suitors&#x27; attentions. So shy that she cannot even speak on the telephone, Yukiko is sometimes frustrating, but ultimately loved by her sisters.
* Yuko Kotegawa - Taeko Makioka: The youngest Makioka sister embraces both Western clothing style and Western attitudes toward the world more than any of her sisters. Taeko smokes, has affairs and willfully defies the orders of the main Osaka house. This is mostly because she is impatient waiting for Yukiko to marry, which she must do before Taeko is allowed. Taeko is called &quot;Koi san&quot; endearingly, by her two older sisters in Ashiya. Calling the youngest sister &quot;Koi san&quot; is something commonly practiced in Osaka.
* Juzo Itami - Tatsuo Makioka: Tsuruko&#x27;s husband, who took the Makioka name when he married her, and is now the master of the Makiokas. The three Ashiya sisters find Tatsuo abrasive, and somewhat dull. Tatsuo is employed at a bank.
* Koji Ishizaka - Teinosuke Makioka: Sachiko&#x27;s husband who also took on the Makioka name. Teinosuke is kind, respectful of the sisters and brilliantly smart, especially when it comes to literary arts, such as poetry and letter-writing. Teinosuke is an accountant.
* Kobeicho Katsura - Okubata: Also called &quot;Kei-boy&quot; by the Ashiya sisters, is one of Taeko&#x27;s suitors with whom she tried, and failed, to elope ten years before the story&#x27;s beginning. 
* Itokku Kishibe - Itakura: A photographer friend of Taeko&#x27;s, a stranger to the Makioka family, to whom Taeko is attracted.
* Mika Wakabayashi - Etsuko: Sachiko&#x27;s school-aged daughter, who is especially fond of Yukiko.

==Release==
===Home media===
The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection on June 14, 2011 for the first time in the United States. The disc only contains a theatrical trailer as a special feature, along with the standard Criterion booklet.

==Reception==
In February 1985, Vincent Canby called it a &quot;a lovely though not always easy to follow adaptation&quot; of the novel and said &quot;I can&#x27;t be sure that the English subtitles catch what I assume to be the satiric edge to the dialogue in what is a rather sad comedy of manners. What is clear, though, is Mr. Ichikawa&#x27;s cinematic equivalent of a literary style, in which characters are sometimes isolated in extended close-ups that have the effect—if not the substance—of internal monologues or of author&#x27;s comments. &quot;The Makioka Sisters,&quot; though always beautiful to look at, is more stately than emotionally or intellectually involving.&quot;

The film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews, in so far as it has been reviewed at all, earning a rare 100% percent on Rotten Tomatoes, from a pool of reviews with but three &quot;top&quot; reviewers.

<text>The Göppingen Gö 3 &quot;Minimoa&quot; is a single-seat sailplane produced in Germany. It was designed by Martin Schempp and Wolf Hirth and was produced the year after their first glider, the Göppingen Gö 1. It first flew in 1935. The name is derived from the name Moazagotl given to lenticularis clouds caused by the foehn wind in Sudetenland. The name was used for one of Hirth&#x27;s earlier gliders and since the Gö 3 was a smaller version, it was called &#x27;Mini&#x27; as a diminutive.

It established several records, including the world altitude record of 6,687 m (21,939 ft) in 1938 in a thunderstorm. Richard du Pont and Chet Decker flew Minimoas to win the US Championships in 1937 and 1938.

It was made out of wood and fabric with cantilevered &#x27;gull&#x27; wings. A B-version in 1938 had thinner wings with a modified section and the gull&#x27;s kink in a different place. The undercarriage was non-retractable. It was the first glider built to carry water-ballast in a tank behind the pilot.

Only five Minimoas remain airworthy: two in Germany, one in Japan, one replica built in the Netherlands and the latest one to fly in the U.K. One more is being prepared for flight in Bacchus Marsh Australia.

A 1935 Minimoa is on display at the National Soaring Museum in Elmira, NY (USA). The only known Minimoa still in private ownership in the USA is a 1938 owned by Jerry Wenger in Powell, WY (USA).

<text>Metrosexuality is a British television comedy drama, which aired on Channel 4 in 2001 as a short-run series of six episodes. It was later re-edited into a single feature for DVD release by TLA Releasing. It depicts the interactions of a racially and sexually diverse group of friends and family living in Notting Hill.

The series was written and created by Rikki Beadle-Blair, who also stars as one of the show&#x27;s central characters. The cast also includes Noel Clarke, Paul Keating, Mat Fraser, Karl Collins, Pui Fan Lee and Preeya Kalidas. The show features extravagant and colourful costumes and scenery, varied shooting styles and quick pacing. Much of the music was written and performed by Beadle Blair, who intended the series to feel like a musical.

The show was hailed by critics for its diversity; it depicted a social setting relatively free of racism or homophobia. The cast also included Mat Fraser, a thalidomide survivor with phocomelic arms.

==Plot outline==
The story is set over the course of two consecutive weekends in spring, and follows Kwame (Clarke), seventeen and straight, who is trying to reconcile his estranged fathers, Max (Beadle Blair) and Jordan (Collins). He must contend with Max&#x27;s insistence that he is over Jordan, and Jordan&#x27;s new relationship with former military man Jonno. Kwame is also trying to attract his love interest, Asha, and provide support to his two best friends: Dean (Keating), a talented footballer struggling with an abusive father and a crush on Max, and skater boy Bambi, trying unsuccessfully to secure a commitment from his older, on-off boyfriend, Robin.

Max&#x27;s married friends Geri and Daniel descend into a bitter separation after Geri feels Daniel takes her for granted; she is later romanced by Asha&#x27;s father, Tel. Asha&#x27;s best friend Jay (Lee) embarks on a new relationship with the enigmatic Flora, despite her own commitment issues. Former drug addicts Peggy and Pablo struggle to adapt to a life of sobriety together - especially when Peggy gets back in touch with their dealer, Dean&#x27;s brother Marlon (Fraser). Max&#x27;s sister Cindy finds her relationship with her partner Doris threatened by the reappearance of her first boyfriend, Gabriel. Kwame&#x27;s unstable birth mother, Hilly, deals with the death of her cat and reconnects with her estranged parents.

<doc id="456800" wikidata="Q3287805" url="?curid=456800" title="Marc Bellemare">
<text>Marc Bellemare (born 3 May 1956) is a lawyer and politician from Canada.

==Background==

He was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, studied Law at the Université de Montréal and was admitted to the Bar of Quebec in 1979.

==Provincial politics==
Bellemare ran as a star candidate with the Liberal Party in the Quebec election of 2003. He was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec and represented the Quebec City electoral district of Vanier.

He was appointed to Premier Jean Charest&#x27;s Cabinet on April 29, 2003 and served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General. Bellemare pushed for harsher sentences for organized crime. He was criticized several times by Justice Fraser Martin for the way he handled a juvenile prostitution case which took place in Quebec City and involved talk show host Robert Gillet.

For several years, Bellemare has been a strong advocate of abolishing Quebec&#x27;s car insurance law. He tried to convince his colleagues to abolish the provincial no fault car insurance plan that had been established in 1978. The Liberals, who had made the proposed change part of their platform, soon abandoned the idea. Disappointed, Bellemare resigned from his cabinet post on April 27, 2004 and relinquished his seat the next day, lasting less than a year in office.

==Mayoral candidate==
After months of rumors, Bellemare announced that he would be candidate for Mayor of Quebec City. His announcement was made on March 11, 2004. He also founded a political party, &quot;Vision Quebec&quot;, which was registered on February 22, 2005. Bellemare ended up finishing a distant third. (See 2005 Quebec municipal elections) Originally leading the 2004 polls with over 80% support in the City of Quebec his support disappeared because when asked about his party finances he stated “ I do not know where the funds are coming from I don’t concern myself with questions of money.” This gave citizens concern and he was resoundingly rejected in the election. He also put forward proposals to save the Agora, an outdoor concert venue in the old port of Quebec city.

An early mayoral election was called in 2007, after the death of incumbent Mayor Andrée Boucher. Bellemare ran and finished a distant third again. He resigned as party leader on December 26, 2007. In 2008, Bellemare unsuccessfully petitioned the Papal Nuncio to Canada for an eventual visit of Pope Benedict XVI in Quebec City. Nonetheless, Bellemare was still listed as party leader on the Quebec Chief Election Officer&#x27;s web site as of June 2008.

<doc id="456802" wikidata="Q3940122" url="?curid=456802" title="Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester">
<text>Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester ( – 25 April 1264), and the hereditary Constable of Scotland, was a nobleman of Anglo-Norman and Scottish descent who was prominent in both England and Scotland, at his death having one of the largest baronial landholdings in the two kingdoms.

==Early life==
The de Quincy family, originating from the village of Cuinchy in Artois, had been prominent in England and Scotland from about 1130. Roger, second son and eventual heir of Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester, and his wife Margaret, younger daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Roger was likely the son that Saer handed over to King John in 1213 as a Scottish hostage to ensure the Anglo-Scottish treaty of 1212. He first became involved in politics in 1215, when he, along with Saer and the leaders of the baronial rebellion against John, was excommunicated by Innocent III. However, he did not play a major role in the civil war that erupted after the king&#x27;s death. Roger probably joined his father on the Fifth Crusade, during which the elder de Quincy fell sick in Egypt and died. Since Roger&#x27;s older brother Robert had died a few years earlier, he inherited his father&#x27;s estates on his return, but was not recognised as earl until his mother died in 1235.

==Career==
Roger married a major heiress, Helen of Galloway, the eldest of the three daughters of Alan, Lord of Galloway. On her father&#x27;s death in 1234, he acquired her share of the paternal inheritance, which consisted of the hereditary office of Constable of Scotland and one-third of the lordship of Galloway. The title of Lord of Galloway, however, went through Helen&#x27;s half-sister Devorguilla to her husband John Balliol.

In 1235 the Galwegians rebelled under Gille Ruadh, not wanting their land divided, but the rebellion was suppressed by King Alexander II of Scotland. The Galwegians revolted again in 1246, following the death without children of Helen&#x27;s sister Christina, first wife of William de Forz, 4th Earl of Aumale. Further unrest in 1247, possibly due to his strict rule, found de Quincy trapped in a castle, from which he escaped to obtain help from King Alexander in suppressing the rebellion. Although actively managing his lands in Scotland, despite being Constable after this time he seems to have had little further involvement in Scotland&#x27;s politics and wars.

In England he also steered clear of politics initially but was gradually drawn into the baronial opposition to the rule of King Henry III, He joined with other nobles in 1239 and 1246 in written remonstrances to the Pope about papal interference in English affairs. In 1258, he was elected by the barons to the twelve-member commission charged with overseeing the revised constitution of the Provisions of Oxford and was appointed also to the committee to arrange the financial aid promised to Henry. In 1259 he led a delegation to St Omer that forbade the King&#x27;s brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall from returning to England unless he swore to observe the Provisions of Oxford. After this de Quincy played little part in national affairs.

He died aged about 69 on 25 April 1264, eighteen days after the outbreak of civil war, and was buried at Brackley. Having no male heir, the earldom of Winchester became extinct and his estates were divided among the husbands of his three daughters.

==Family==

He married three times, leaving three daughters from his first marriage to Helen of Galloway:
*Margaret (or Margery), who married William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby; 
*Elizabeth (or Isabel or Isabella), who married Alexander Comyn, 2nd Earl of Buchan;
*Helen, who married Alan de la Zouche.
His second marriage was in about 1250 to Maud de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, who died in 1252. Thirdly, in 1252, he married Eleanor de Ferrers, daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby. Neither of these marriages produced any children.

<doc id="456810" wikidata="Q3811322" url="?curid=456810" title="Alveley">
<text>Alveley is a village in the Severn Valley in southeast Shropshire, England, about south-southeast of Bridgnorth. It is in the civil parish of Alveley and Romsley. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,098. It is served by bus service 297 (Kidderminster - Bridgnorth) operated by Select Bus Services. It is most famously known as being the hometown of Jack Jones, a local magician. 

The Black Death is said to have killed 60% of the village population in 1349. A stone cross, the Buttercross, outside the village dates from the time of the Black Death when it was a place for food to be left for the village when it was quarantined.

==Churches==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary is 12th-century with a 14th-century south chapel. In the chapel is a very faded 14th-century mural that is thought to represent the Seven Deadly Sins. The upper part of the tower was rebuilt in about 1779. The building was heavily restored in 1878–79 under the direction of Sir Arthur Blomfield. It is a Grade II* listed building. The church contains a stone war memorial, inscribed with names of dead from both World Wars, with its centre piece a figure of Christ with arms outstretched and, below it on a shelf, a wooden grave marker cross to Signaller William Horace Leith who died at a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Thailand in 1943.

Alveley has also an ex-Methodist chapel, which was built in 1862 and is now used as a community centre and tea room.

==Coal mining and country park==
From 1937 to 1969 the village had a coal mine in conjunction with the neighbouring village of Highley across the River Severn. The first shaft at Alveley Colliery was sunk in 1935. Production began in 1938 and reached full output in 1944. Coal was transferred to sidings on the Severn Valley Railway on the opposite bank of the river, to be taken away by rail. Declining coal quality at a time of national over-supply led to the colliery closing in January 1969 leaving high unemployment and a ravaged landscape. An industrial estate was built after the mine closure along with a landscape reclamation scheme in 1986 and the disused colliery and spoil tips were converted into the Severn Valley Country Park.

The landscape includes meadows, woods, ponds and wetlands with waymarked trails of short and longer lengths to encourage locals and visitors to explore the village&#x27;s heritage fully. Every year a Miner&#x27;s Memories Day is held at the Country Park Visitor Centre which permanently houses mine memorabilia and has a café and indoor viewpoint over the valley. The display includes miners&#x27; picks, spikes, crowbars, breathing equipment used in mine rescue, photos (many donated by local residents), and a certificate awarded to a local Alveley miner on achieving &quot;56 years service to the mine and his country&quot;.

In 2006 a new footbridge linking Alveley and Highley was opened in the Country Park. This replaced a 1930s bridge that had become unsafe. The bridge provides access from Alveley to the Country Park Halt on the Severn Valley Railway, which is on the Highley side of the river on the site of the former coal washing plant and colliery sidings. The riverbank is popular with anglers, along with a number of local private pools.

In 2017, the community led Alveley Mining Heritage Group was formed to preserve and present memories of mining in the village for the benefit of future generations.

==Village==
Alveley has several historic pubs including the Three Horseshoes, parts of which may be 17th-century. The others are The Squirrel and The Royal Oak. There is also the Mill Hotel and a working men&#x27;s club. The village has a primary school, small supermarket and newsagent and a few other small shops and eateries, in addition to its &#x27;Parish Memorial Hall&#x27; and attached recreation ground which was opened in 1947 as a memorial to local dead of both World Wars.

==Cricket club==
Alveley Cricket Club was founded in 1908 and played at Coton Hall on the outskirts of the village, at the former home of general Robert E. Lee&#x27;s ancestors. After the Second World War it moved to play on the Recreation Ground in the centre of Alveley.

The club has invested heavily in its facilities. Its pavilion was built in 1981 and extended in 2007. The club has a potential player base of 100 people who regularly play for the club. The club has always had a strong commitment to youth cricket and the continued growth in its junior section.

Off the field the club has an active social calendar and regularly hold family social events. Events include a six-a-side competition, barbecues, charity events and screening live sport in the Pavilion.

Until the mid-1970s friendly cricket was played before joining the Kidderminster League in 1989. The club now plays in the Worcestershire County League (Saturday) with friendlies played on a Sunday. As well as the two Saturday sides we run a midweek team who play in the Kidderminster League, the club also runs a successful junior section for children aged between 4 and 17 years.

==Countryside==
A small hamlet to the southwest of the village, Little London, is one of more than 25 settlements which share the capital city&#x27;s name.

The parish contains two other manors, besides the manor of Alveley, Kingsnordley and Astley. Alan James Nicholls documented the Alveley parish in The History of Alveley, published 1994, .

==Governance==
Alveley is part of the electoral ward called Alveley &amp; Claverley. The 2011 Census recorded the ward population as 4,032. The Local Government Boundary Commission for England launched a review of the number of councillors, electoral divisions and electoral division names for Shropshire Council. As it currently stands, Alveley will be part of the new electoral ward of Bridgnorth South &amp; Alveley.

The most recent by-election on 19 October 2023 resulted in Colin Taylor being elected as the Liberal Democrat councillor for Alveley &amp; Claverley.


This seat will be up for election again in the 2025 United Kingdom local elections.

<text>Ten ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS &quot;Hussar&quot;, after the hussar.

* The first was a 28-gun sixth rate launched in 1757 and captured by the French in 1762 after running aground off Cape François, Hispaniola due to the negligence of the pilot and the master.
* The second was a 28-gun sixth rate launched in 1763 and wrecked on 24 November 1780 while trying to negotiate the Hell Gate passage near New York City. &quot;Hussar&quot; settled to the bottom, with her masts above water, on the Bronx (north) side of the channel shore. Rumors that she was carrying thousands of pounds in gold coin have never been confirmed, and repeated attempts to salvage the wreck have proven unsuccessful.
* The third &quot;Hussar&quot; was an American galley captured in 1778 and sold 1786. This &quot;Hussar&quot; may be the same &quot;Hussar&quot; galley built in Philadelphia during the 1777–1778 British occupation on the orders of Captain Sir Andrew Hammond to the Loyalists. It was used during the Battle of Red Bank and at Fort Mifflin under Lord Cornwallis.
* The fourth &quot;Hussar&quot; was the Massachusetts Navy&#x27;s 26-gun sixth-rate , of 586 tons (bm), launched in 1779 at Newburyport, Massachusetts, that and captured on 5 May 1781; the Royal Navy renamed her HMS &quot;Hussar&quot; and sold her in 1783. The Danish East India Company purchased her.
* The fifth was a 28-gun sixth rate launched in 1784 and wrecked on 27 December 1796 when a strong storm drove her onshore about 15 miles west of the Île de Batz.
* The sixth was a 14-gun sloop, originally the French privateer &quot;Hussard&quot;, captured in 1798 and sold 1800.
* The seventh was a 38-gun fifth rate launched in 1799 and wrecked on 8 February 1804 by grounding on a reef near the Île de Sein. Her crew burnt her and most escaped in fishing vessels they commandeered from the islanders. 
* The eighth was a 46-gun fifth rate launched 1807 and used in 1861 as a target.
* The ninth was a torpedo gunboat in service from 1894 to 1920.
* The tenth was a minesweeper launched in 1934 and accidentally sunk in 1944 off Normandy by Royal Air Force aircraft.

<text>The [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] is the set of rules governing writing of software in C. It is designed to allow for programs that are extremely terse, have a close relationship with the resulting object code, and yet provide relatively high-level data abstraction. C was the first widely successful high-level language for portable operating-system development.

C syntax makes use of the maximal munch principle.

==Data structures==
===Primitive data types===
The C programming language represents numbers in three forms: &quot;integral&quot;, &quot;real&quot; and &quot;complex&quot;. This distinction reflects similar distinctions in the instruction set architecture of most central processing units. &quot;Integral&quot; data types store numbers in the set of integers, while &quot;real&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; numbers represent numbers (or pair of numbers) in the set of real numbers in floating-point form.

All C integer types have and variants. If or is not specified explicitly, in most circumstances, is assumed. However, for historic reasons, plain is a type distinct from both and . It may be a signed type or an unsigned type, depending on the compiler and the character set (C guarantees that members of the C basic character set have positive values). Also, bit field types specified as plain may be signed or unsigned, depending on the compiler.

====Integer types====
C&#x27;s integer types come in different fixed sizes, capable of representing various ranges of numbers. The type occupies exactly one byte (the smallest addressable storage unit), which is typically 8 bits wide. (Although can represent any of C&#x27;s &quot;basic&quot; characters, a wider type may be required for international character sets.) Most integer types have both signed and unsigned varieties, designated by the and keywords. Signed integer types always use the two&#x27;s complement representation, since C23 (and in practice before; in older C versions before C23 the representation might alternatively have been ones&#x27; complement, or sign-and-magnitude, but in practice that has not been the case for decades on modern hardware). In many cases, there are multiple equivalent ways to designate the type; for example, and are synonymous.

The representation of some types may include unused &quot;padding&quot; bits, which occupy storage but are not included in the width. The following table provides a complete list of the standard integer types and their &quot;minimum&quot; allowed widths (including any sign bit).

The type is distinct from both and , but is guaranteed to have the same representation as one of them. The and types are standardized since 1999, and may not be supported by older C compilers. Type is usually accessed via the codice_1 name defined by the standard header codice_2.

In general, the widths and representation scheme implemented for any given platform are chosen based on the machine architecture, with some consideration given to the ease of importing source code developed for other platforms. The width of the type varies especially widely among C implementations; it often corresponds to the most &quot;natural&quot; word size for the specific platform. The standard header limits.h defines macros for the minimum and maximum representable values of the standard integer types as implemented on any specific platform.

In addition to the standard integer types, there may be other &quot;extended&quot; integer types, which can be used for s in standard headers. For more precise specification of width, programmers can and should use s from the standard header stdint.h.

Integer constants may be specified in source code in several ways. Numeric values can be specified as decimal (example: ), octal with zero () as a prefix (), or hexadecimal with (zero x) as a prefix (). A character in single quotes (example: ), called a &quot;character constant,&quot; represents the value of that character in the execution character set, with type . Except for character constants, the type of an integer constant is determined by the width required to represent the specified value, but is always at least as wide as . This can be overridden by appending an explicit length and/or signedness modifier; for example, has type . There are no negative integer constants, but the same effect can often be obtained by using a unary negation operator &quot;&quot;.

====Enumerated type====
The enumerated type in C, specified with the keyword, and often just called an &quot;enum&quot; (usually pronounced or ), is a type designed to represent values across a series of named constants. Each of the enumerated constants has type . Each type itself is compatible with or a signed or unsigned integer type, but each implementation defines its own rules for choosing a type.

Some compilers warn if an object with enumerated type is assigned a value that is not one of its constants. However, such an object can be assigned any values in the range of their compatible type, and constants can be used anywhere an integer is expected. For this reason, values are often used in place of preprocessor directives to create named constants. Such constants are generally safer to use than macros, since they reside within a specific identifier namespace.

An enumerated type is declared with the specifier and an optional name (or &quot;tag&quot;) for the enum, followed by a list of one or more constants contained within curly braces and separated by commas, and an optional list of variable names. Subsequent references to a specific enumerated type use the keyword and the name of the enum. By default, the first constant in an enumeration is assigned the value zero, and each subsequent value is incremented by one over the previous constant. Specific values may also be assigned to constants in the declaration, and any subsequent constants without specific values will be given incremented values from that point onward.
For example, consider the following declaration:

enum colors { RED, GREEN, BLUE = 5, YELLOW } paint_color;

This declares the type; the constants (whose value is 0), (whose value is one greater than , 1), (whose value is the given value, 5), and (whose value is one greater than , 6); and the variable . The constants may be used outside of the context of the (where any integer value is allowed), and values other than the constants may be assigned to , or any other variable of type .

====Floating-point types====
A floating-point form is used to represent numbers with a fractional component. They do not, however, represent most rational numbers exactly; they are instead a close approximation. There are three standard types of real values, denoted by their specifiers (and since C23 three more decimal types): single precision (), double precision (), and double extended precision (). Each of these may represent values in a different form, often one of the IEEE floating-point formats.

Floating-point constants may be written in decimal notation, e.g. . Decimal scientific notation may be used by adding or followed by a decimal exponent, also known as E notation, e.g. (which has the value 1.23 × 102 = 123.0). Either a decimal point or an exponent is required (otherwise, the number is parsed as an integer constant). Hexadecimal floating-point constants follow similar rules, except that they must be prefixed by and use or to specify a binary exponent, e.g. (which has the value 2.5, since Ah × 2−2 = 10 × 2−2 = 10 ÷ 4). Both decimal and hexadecimal floating-point constants may be suffixed by or to indicate a constant of type , by (letter ) or to indicate type , or left unsuffixed for a constant.

The standard header file  defines the minimum and maximum values of the implementation&#x27;s floating-point types , , and . It also defines other limits that are relevant to the processing of floating-point numbers.

C23 introduces three additional &quot;decimal&quot; (as opposed to binary) real floating-point types: _Decimal32, _Decimal64, and _Decimal128. 

: NOTE C does not specify a radix for float, double, and long double. An implementation can choose the representation of float, double, and long double to be the same as the decimal floating types.

Despite that, the radix has historically been binary (base 2), meaning numbers like 1/2 or 1/4 are exact, but not 1/10, 1/100 or 1/3. With decimal floating point all the same numbers are exact plus numbers like 1/10 and 1/100, but still not e.g. 1/3. No known implementation does opt into the decimal radix for the previously known to be binary types. Since most computers do not even have the hardware for the decimal types, and those few that do (e.g. IBM mainframes since IBM System z10), can use the explicitly decimal types.

====Storage class specifiers====
Every object has a storage class. This specifies most basically the storage &quot;duration,&quot; which may be static (default for global), automatic (default for local), or dynamic (allocated), together with other features (linkage and register hint).

:1 Allocated and deallocated using the and library functions.

Variables declared within a block by default have automatic storage, as do those explicitly declared with the  or  storage class specifiers. The and specifiers may only be used within functions and function argument declarations; as such, the specifier is always redundant. Objects declared outside of all blocks and those explicitly declared with the  storage class specifier have static storage duration. Static variables are initialized to zero by default by the compiler.

Objects with automatic storage are local to the block in which they were declared and are discarded when the block is exited. Additionally, objects declared with the storage class may be given higher priority by the compiler for access to registers; although the compiler may choose not to actually store any of them in a register. Objects with this storage class may not be used with the address-of () unary operator. Objects with static storage persist for the program&#x27;s entire duration. In this way, the same object can be accessed by a function across multiple calls. Objects with allocated storage duration are created and destroyed explicitly with , , and related functions.

The  storage class specifier indicates that the storage for an object has been defined elsewhere. When used inside a block, it indicates that the storage has been defined by a declaration outside of that block. When used outside of all blocks, it indicates that the storage has been defined outside of the compilation unit. The storage class specifier is redundant when used on a function declaration. It indicates that the declared function has been defined outside of the compilation unit.

The  (codice_3 in C++, and in C since C23, and in earlier versions of C if the header codice_4 is included) storage class specifier, introduced in C11, is used to declare a thread-local variable. It can be combined with or to determine linkage.

Note that storage specifiers apply only to functions and objects; other things such as type and enum declarations are private to the compilation unit in which they appear. Types, on the other hand, have qualifiers (see below).

====Type qualifiers====

Types can be qualified to indicate special properties of their data. The type qualifier codice_5 indicates that a value does not change once it has been initialized. Attempting to modify a codice_6 qualified value yields undefined behavior, so some C compilers store them in rodata or (for embedded systems) in read-only memory (ROM). The type qualifier codice_7 indicates to an optimizing compiler that it may not remove apparently redundant reads or writes, as the value may change even if it was not modified by any expression or statement, or multiple writes may be necessary, such as for memory-mapped I/O.

===Incomplete types===
An incomplete type is a structure or union type whose members have not yet been specified, an array type whose dimension has not yet been specified, or the type (the type cannot be completed). Such a type may not be instantiated (its size is not known), nor may its members be accessed (they, too, are unknown); however, the derived pointer type may be used (but not dereferenced).

They are often used with pointers, either as forward or external declarations. For instance, code could declare an incomplete type like this:
struct thing *pt;
This declares as a pointer to &quot;and&quot; the incomplete type . Pointers to data always have the same byte-width regardless of what they point to, so this statement is valid by itself (as long as is not dereferenced). The incomplete type can be completed later in the same scope by redeclaring it:
struct thing {
 int num;
}; /* thing struct type is now completed */
Incomplete types are used to implement recursive structures; the body of the type declaration may be deferred to later in the translation unit:
typedef struct Bert Bert;
typedef struct Wilma Wilma;

struct Bert {
 Wilma *wilma;

struct Wilma {
 Bert *bert;


Incomplete types are also used for data hiding; the incomplete type is defined in a header file, and the body only within the relevant source file.

===Pointers===
In declarations the asterisk modifier () specifies a pointer type. For example, where the specifier would refer to the integer type, the specifier refers to the type &quot;pointer to integer&quot;. Pointer values associate two pieces of information: a memory address and a data type. The following line of code declares a pointer-to-integer variable called &quot;ptr&quot;:

int *ptr;

====Referencing====
When a non-static pointer is declared, it has an unspecified value associated with it. The address associated with such a pointer must be changed by assignment prior to using it. In the following example, &quot;ptr&quot; is set so that it points to the data associated with the variable &quot;a&quot;:
int a = 0;
int *ptr = &amp;a;
In order to accomplish this, the &quot;address-of&quot; operator (unary ) is used. It produces the memory location of the data object that follows.

====Dereferencing====
The pointed-to data can be accessed through a pointer value. In the following example, the integer variable &quot;b&quot; is set to the value of integer variable &quot;a&quot;, which is 10:
int a=10;
int *p;
p = &amp;a;
int b = *p;
In order to accomplish that task, the unary dereference operator, denoted by an asterisk (*), is used. It returns the data to which its operand—which must be of pointer type—points. Thus, the expression *&quot;p&quot; denotes the same value as &quot;a&quot;. Dereferencing a null pointer is illegal.

===Arrays===

====Array definition====
Arrays are used in C to represent structures of consecutive elements of the same type. The definition of a (fixed-size) array has the following syntax:

int array[100];

which defines an array named &quot;array&quot; to hold 100 values of the primitive type . If declared within a function, the array dimension may also be a non-constant expression, in which case memory for the specified number of elements will be allocated. In most contexts in later use, a mention of the variable &quot;array&quot; is converted to a pointer to the first item in the array. The  operator is an exception: yields the size of the entire array (that is, 100 times the size of an , and will return 100). Another exception is the &amp; (address-of) operator, which yields a pointer to the entire array, for example

int (*ptr_to_array)[100] = &amp;array;

====Accessing elements====
The primary facility for accessing the values of the elements of an array is the array subscript operator. To access the &quot;i&quot;-indexed element of &quot;array&quot;, the syntax would be , which refers to the value stored in that array element.

Array subscript numbering begins at 0 (see Zero-based indexing). The largest allowed array subscript is therefore equal to the number of elements in the array minus 1. To illustrate this, consider an array &quot;a&quot; declared as having 10 elements; the first element would be and the last element would be .

C provides no facility for automatic bounds checking for array usage. Though logically the last subscript in an array of 10 elements would be 9, subscripts 10, 11, and so forth could accidentally be specified, with undefined results.

Due to arrays and pointers being interchangeable, the addresses of each of the array elements can be expressed in equivalent pointer arithmetic. The following table illustrates both methods for the existing array:

Since the expression is semantically equivalent to , which in turn is equivalent to , the expression can also be written as , although this form is rarely used.

====Variable-length arrays====
C99 standardised variable-length arrays (VLAs) within block scope. Such array variables are allocated based on the value of an integer value at runtime upon entry to a block, and are deallocated at the end of the block. As of C11 this feature is no longer required to be implemented by the compiler.
int n = ...;
int a[n];
a[3] = 10;
This syntax produces an array whose size is fixed until the end of the block.

====Dynamic arrays====

Arrays that can be resized dynamically can be produced with the help of the C standard library. The codice_8 function provides a simple method for allocating memory. It takes one parameter: the amount of memory to allocate in bytes. Upon successful allocation, returns a generic () pointer value, pointing to the beginning of the allocated space. The pointer value returned is converted to an appropriate type implicitly by assignment. If the allocation could not be completed, returns a null pointer. The following segment is therefore similar in function to the above desired declaration:
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; /* declares malloc */
int *a = malloc(n * sizeof *a);
a[3] = 10;
The result is a &quot;pointer to &quot; variable (&quot;a&quot;) that points to the first of &quot;n&quot; contiguous objects; due to array–pointer equivalence this can be used in place of an actual array name, as shown in the last line. The advantage in using this dynamic allocation is that the amount of memory that is allocated to it can be limited to what is actually needed at run time, and this can be changed as needed (using the standard library function ).

When the dynamically allocated memory is no longer needed, it should be released back to the run-time system. This is done with a call to the function. It takes a single parameter: a pointer to previously allocated memory. This is the value that was returned by a previous call to .

As a security measure, some programmers then set the pointer variable to :
free(a);
a = NULL;
This ensures that further attempts to dereference the pointer, on most systems, will crash the program. If this is not done, the variable becomes a dangling pointer which can lead to a use-after-free bug. However, if the pointer is a local variable, setting it to does not prevent the program from using other copies of the pointer. Local use-after-free bugs are usually easy for static analyzers to recognize. Therefore, this approach is less useful for local pointers and it is more often used with pointers stored in long-living structs. In general though, setting pointers to is good practice as it allows a programmer to -check pointers prior to dereferencing, thus helping prevent crashes.

Recalling the array example, one could also create a fixed-size array through dynamic allocation:
int (*a)[100] = malloc(sizeof *a);
...Which yields a pointer-to-array.

Accessing the pointer-to-array can be done in two ways:

(*a)[index];

index[*a];
Iterating can also be done in two ways:

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
 (*a)[i];

for (int *i = a[0]; i &lt; a[1]; i++)
 *i;
The benefit to using the second example is that the numeric limit of the first example isn&#x27;t required, which means that the pointer-to-array could be of any size and the second example can execute without any modifications.

====Multidimensional arrays====
In addition, C supports arrays of multiple dimensions, which are stored in row-major order. Technically, C multidimensional arrays are just one-dimensional arrays whose elements are arrays. The syntax for declaring multidimensional arrays is as follows:
 int array2d[ROWS][COLUMNS];

where &quot;ROWS&quot; and &quot;COLUMNS&quot; are constants. This defines a two-dimensional array. Reading the subscripts from left to right, &quot;array2d&quot; is an array of length &quot;ROWS&quot;, each element of which is an array of &quot;COLUMNS&quot; integers.

To access an integer element in this multidimensional array, one would use
 array2d[4][3]

Again, reading from left to right, this accesses the 5th row, and the 4th element in that row. The expression is an array, which we are then subscripting with [3] to access the fourth integer.

Higher-dimensional arrays can be declared in a similar manner.

A multidimensional array should not be confused with an array of pointers to arrays (also known as an Iliffe vector or sometimes an &quot;array of arrays&quot;). The former is always rectangular (all subarrays must be the same size), and occupies a contiguous region of memory. The latter is a one-dimensional array of pointers, each of which may point to the first element of a subarray in a different place in memory, and the sub-arrays do not have to be the same size. The latter can be created by multiple uses of .

===Strings===
In C, string literals are surrounded by double quotes () (e.g., ) and are compiled to an array of the specified values with an additional null terminating character (0-valued) code to mark the end of the string.

String literals may not contain embedded newlines; this proscription somewhat simplifies parsing of the language. To include a newline in a string, the backslash escape may be used, as below.

There are several standard library functions for operating with string data (not necessarily constant) organized as array of using this null-terminated format; see below.

C&#x27;s string-literal syntax has been very influential, and has made its way into many other languages, such as C++, Objective-C, Perl, Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Ruby. Nowadays, almost all new languages adopt or build upon C-style string syntax. Languages that lack this syntax tend to precede C.

====Backslash escapes====

Because certain characters cannot be part of a literal string expression directly, they are instead identified by an escape sequence starting with a backslash (). For example, the backslashes in indicate (to the compiler) that the inner pair of quotes are intended as an actual part of the string, rather than the default reading as a delimiter (endpoint) of the string itself.

Backslashes may be used to enter various control characters, etc., into a string:
The use of other backslash escapes is not defined by the C standard, although compiler vendors often provide additional escape codes as language extensions. One of these is the escape sequence codice_9 for the escape character with ASCII hex value 1B which was not added to the C standard due to lacking representation in other character sets (such as EBCDIC). It is available in GCC, clang and tcc.

====String literal concatenation====
C has string literal concatenation, meaning that adjacent string literals are concatenated at compile time; this allows long strings to be split over multiple lines, and also allows string literals resulting from C preprocessor defines and macros to be appended to strings at compile time:

 printf(__FILE__ &quot;: %d: Hello &quot;
 &quot;world\n&quot;, __LINE__);

will expand to

 printf(&quot;helloworld.c&quot; &quot;: %d: Hello &quot;
 &quot;world\n&quot;, 10);

which is syntactically equivalent to

 printf(&quot;helloworld.c: %d: Hello world\n&quot;, 10);
====Character constants====
Individual character constants are single-quoted, e.g. , and have type (in C++, ). The difference is that represents a null-terminated array of two characters, &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;\0&#x27;, whereas directly represents the character value (65 if ASCII is used). The same backslash-escapes are supported as for strings, except that (of course) can validly be used as a character without being escaped, whereas must now be escaped.

A character constant cannot be empty (i.e. is invalid syntax), although a string may be (it still has the null terminating character). Multi-character constants (e.g. ) are valid, although rarely useful — they let one store several characters in an integer (e.g. 4 ASCII characters can fit in a 32-bit integer, 8 in a 64-bit one). Since the order in which the characters are packed into an is not specified (left to the implementation to define), portable use of multi-character constants is difficult.

Nevertheless, in situations limited to a specific platform and the compiler implementation, multicharacter constants do find their use in specifying signatures. One common use case is the OSType, where the combination of Classic Mac OS compilers and its inherent big-endianness means that bytes in the integer appear in the exact order of characters defined in the literal. The definition by popular &quot;implementations&quot; are in fact consistent: in GCC, Clang, and Visual C++, yields codice_10 under ASCII.

Like string literals, character constants can also be modified by prefixes, for example has type and represents the character value of &quot;A&quot; in the wide character encoding.

====Wide character strings====
Since type is 1 byte wide, a single value typically can represent at most 255 distinct character codes, not nearly enough for all the characters in use worldwide. To provide better support for international characters, the first C standard (C89) introduced wide characters (encoded in type ) and wide character strings, which are written as 

Wide characters are most commonly either 2 bytes (using a 2-byte encoding such as UTF-16) or 4 bytes (usually UTF-32), but Standard C does not specify the width for , leaving the choice to the implementor. Microsoft Windows generally uses UTF-16, thus the above string would be 26 bytes long for a Microsoft compiler; the Unix world prefers UTF-32, thus compilers such as GCC would generate a 52-byte string. A 2-byte wide suffers the same limitation as , in that certain characters (those outside the BMP) cannot be represented in a single ; but must be represented using surrogate pairs.

The original C standard specified only minimal functions for operating with wide character strings; in 1995 the standard was modified to include much more extensive support, comparable to that for strings. The relevant functions are mostly named after their equivalents, with the addition of a &quot;w&quot; or the replacement of &quot;str&quot; with &quot;wcs&quot;; they are specified in , with containing wide-character classification and mapping functions.

The now generally recommended method of supporting international characters is through UTF-8, which is stored in arrays, and can be written directly in the source code if using a UTF-8 editor, because UTF-8 is a direct ASCII extension.

====Variable width strings====
A common alternative to is to use a variable-width encoding, whereby a logical character may extend over multiple positions of the string. Variable-width strings may be encoded into literals verbatim, at the risk of confusing the compiler, or using numerical backslash escapes (e.g. for &quot;é&quot; in UTF-8). The UTF-8 encoding was specifically designed (under Plan 9) for compatibility with the standard library string functions; supporting features of the encoding include a lack of embedded nulls, no valid interpretations for subsequences, and trivial resynchronisation. Encodings lacking these features are likely to prove incompatible with the standard library functions; encoding-aware string functions are often used in such cases.

====Library functions====
Strings, both constant and variable, can be manipulated without using the standard library. However, the library contains many useful functions for working with null-terminated strings.

===Structures and unions===

====Structures====
Structures and unions in C are defined as data containers consisting of a sequence of named members of various types. They are similar to records in other programming languages. The members of a structure are stored in consecutive locations in memory, although the compiler is allowed to insert padding between or after members (but not before the first member) for efficiency or as padding required for proper alignment by the target architecture. The size of a structure is equal to the sum of the sizes of its members, plus the size of the padding.

====Unions====
Unions in C are related to structures and are defined as objects that may hold (at different times) objects of different types and sizes. They are analogous to variant records in other programming languages. Unlike structures, the components of a union all refer to the same location in memory. In this way, a union can be used at various times to hold different types of objects, without the need to create a separate object for each new type. The size of a union is equal to the size of its largest component type.

====Declaration====
Structures are declared with the  keyword and unions are declared with the keyword. The specifier keyword is followed by an optional identifier name, which is used to identify the form of the structure or union. The identifier is followed by the declaration of the structure or union&#x27;s body: a list of member declarations, contained within curly braces, with each declaration terminated by a semicolon. Finally, the declaration concludes with an optional list of identifier names, which are declared as instances of the structure or union.

For example, the following statement declares a structure named that contains three members; it will also declare an instance of the structure known as :
struct s {
 int x;
 float y;
 char *z;
} tee;
And the following statement will declare a similar union named and an instance of it named :
union u {
 int x;
 float y;
 char *z;
} n;
Members of structures and unions cannot have an incomplete or function type. Thus members cannot be an instance of the structure or union being declared (because it is incomplete at that point) but can be pointers to the type being declared.

Once a structure or union body has been declared and given a name, it can be considered a new data type using the specifier or , as appropriate, and the name. For example, the following statement, given the above structure declaration, declares a new instance of the structure named :

struct s r;

It is also common to use the codice_1 specifier to eliminate the need for the or keyword in later references to the structure. The first identifier after the body of the structure is taken as the new name for the structure type (structure instances may not be declared in this context). For example, the following statement will declare a new type known as &quot;s_type&quot; that will contain some structure:

typedef struct {...} s_type;

Future statements can then use the specifier &quot;s_type&quot; (instead of the expanded ... specifier) to refer to the structure.

====Accessing members====
Members are accessed using the name of the instance of a structure or union, a period (), and the name of the member. For example, given the declaration of &quot;tee&quot; from above, the member known as &quot;y&quot; (of type ) can be accessed using the following syntax:

tee.y

Structures are commonly accessed through pointers. Consider the following example that defines a pointer to &quot;tee&quot;, known as &quot;ptr_to_tee&quot;:

struct s *ptr_to_tee = &amp;tee;

Member &quot;y&quot; of &quot;tee&quot; can then be accessed by dereferencing &quot;ptr_to_tee&quot; and using the result as the left operand:

(*ptr_to_tee).y

Which is identical to the simpler above as long as &quot;ptr_to_tee&quot; points to &quot;tee&quot;. Due to operator precedence (&quot;.&quot; being higher than &quot;*&quot;), the shorter codice_12 is incorrect for this purpose, instead being parsed as codice_13 and thus the parentheses are necessary. Because this operation is common, C provides an abbreviated syntax for accessing a member directly from a pointer. With this syntax, the name of the instance is replaced with the name of the pointer and the period is replaced with the character sequence . Thus, the following method of accessing &quot;y&quot; is identical to the previous two:

ptr_to_tee-&gt;y

Members of unions are accessed in the same way.

This can be chained; for example, in a linked list, one may refer to codice_14 for the second following node (assuming that codice_15 is not null).

====Assignment====
Assigning values to individual members of structures and unions is syntactically identical to assigning values to any other object. The only difference is that the &quot;lvalue&quot; of the assignment is the name of the member, as accessed by the syntax mentioned above.

A structure can also be assigned as a unit to another structure of the same type. Structures (and pointers to structures) may also be used as function parameter and return types.

For example, the following statement assigns the value of 74 (the ASCII code point for the letter &#x27;t&#x27;) to the member named &quot;x&quot; in the structure &quot;tee&quot;, from above:

tee.x = 74;

And the same assignment, using &quot;ptr_to_tee&quot; in place of &quot;tee&quot;, would look like:

ptr_to_tee-&gt;x = 74;

Assignment with members of unions is identical.

====Other operations====
According to the C standard, the only legal operations that can be performed on a structure are copying it, assigning to it as a unit (or initializing it), taking its address with the address-of () unary operator, and accessing its members. Unions have the same restrictions. One of the operations implicitly forbidden is comparison: structures and unions cannot be compared using C&#x27;s standard comparison facilities (, , , etc.).

====Bit fields====
C also provides a special type of member known as a bit field, which is an integer with an explicitly specified number of bits. A bit field is declared as a structure (or union) member of type , , , or , following the member name by a colon () and the number of bits it should occupy. The total number of bits in a single bit field must not exceed the total number of bits in its declared type (this is allowed in C++ however, where the extra bits are used for padding).

As a special exception to the usual C syntax rules, it is implementation-defined whether a bit field declared as type , without specifying or , is signed or unsigned. Thus, it is recommended to explicitly specify or on all structure members for portability.

Unnamed fields consisting of just a colon followed by a number of bits are also allowed; these indicate padding. Specifying a width of zero for an unnamed field is used to force alignment to a new word. Since all members of a union occupy the same memory, unnamed bit-fields of width zero do nothing in unions, however unnamed bit-fields of non zero width can change the size of the union since they have to fit in it.

The members of bit fields do not have addresses, and as such cannot be used with the address-of () unary operator. The operator may not be applied to bit fields.

The following declaration declares a new structure type known as and an instance of it known as . Comments provide a description of each of the members:
struct f {
 unsigned int flag : 1; /* a bit flag: can either be on (1) or off (0) */
 signed int num : 4; /* a signed 4-bit field; range -7...7 or -8...7 */
 signed int : 3; /* 3 bits of padding to round out to 8 bits */
} g;
===Initialization===
Default initialization depends on the storage class specifier, described above.

Because of the language&#x27;s grammar, a scalar initializer may be enclosed in any number of curly brace pairs. Most compilers issue a warning if there is more than one such pair, though.
int x = 12;
int y = { 23 }; //Legal, no warning
int z = { { 34 } }; //Legal, expect a warning

Structures, unions and arrays can be initialized in their declarations using an initializer list. Unless designators are used, the components of an initializer correspond with the elements in the order they are defined and stored, thus all preceding values must be provided before any particular element&#x27;s value. Any unspecified elements are set to zero (except for unions). Mentioning too many initialization values yields an error.

The following statement will initialize a new instance of the structure &quot;s&quot; known as &quot;pi&quot;:
struct s {
 int x;
 float y;
 char *z;

struct s pi = { 3, 3.1415, &quot;Pi&quot; };

====Designated initializers====
Designated initializers allow members to be initialized by name, in any order, and without explicitly providing the preceding values. The following initialization is equivalent to the previous one:
struct s pi = { .z = &quot;Pi&quot;, .x = 3, .y = 3.1415 };

Using a designator in an initializer moves the initialization &quot;cursor&quot;. In the example below, if codice_16 is greater than 10, there will be some zero-valued elements in the middle of codice_17; if it is less than 10, some of the values provided by the first five initializers will be overridden by the second five (if codice_16 is less than 5, there will be a compilation error):
int a[MAX] = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, [MAX-5] = 8, 6, 4, 2, 0 };

In C89, a union was initialized with a single value applied to its first member. That is, the union &quot;u&quot; defined above could only have its &quot;int x&quot; member initialized:
union u value = { 3 };

Using a designated initializer, the member to be initialized does not have to be the first member:
union u value = { .y = 3.1415 }; 

If an array has unknown size (i.e. the array was an incomplete type), the number of initializers determines the size of the array and its type becomes complete:

int x[] = { 0, 1, 2 } ;

Compound designators can be used to provide explicit initialization when unadorned initializer lists
might be misunderstood. In the example below, codice_19 is declared as an array of structures, each structure consisting of a member codice_17 (an array of 3 codice_21) and a member codice_22 (an codice_21). The initializer sets the size of codice_19 to 2 and sets the values of the first element of each codice_17:
struct { int a[3], b; } w[] = { [0].a = {1}, [1].a[0] = 2 };
This is equivalent to:struct { int a[3], b; } w[] =
 { { 1, 0, 0 }, 0 },
 { { 2, 0, 0 }, 0 } 

There is no way to specify repetition of an initializer in standard C.

====Compound literals====
It is possible to borrow the initialization methodology to generate compound structure and array literals:
// pointer created from array literal.
int *ptr = (int[]){ 10, 20, 30, 40 };

// pointer to array.
float (*foo)[3] = &amp;(float[]){ 0.5f, 1.f, -0.5f };

struct s pi = (struct s){ 3, 3.1415, &quot;Pi&quot; };
Compound literals are often combined with designated initializers to make the declaration more readable:

pi = (struct s){ .z = &quot;Pi&quot;, .x = 3, .y = 3.1415 };

==Operators==
==Control structures==
C is a free-form language.

Bracing style varies from programmer to programmer and can be the subject of debate. See Indentation style for more details.

===Compound statements===
In the items in this section, any &lt;statement&gt; can be replaced with a compound statement. Compound statements have the form:
 &lt;optional-declaration-list&gt;
 &lt;optional-statement-list&gt;

and are used as the body of a function or anywhere that a single statement is expected. The declaration-list declares variables to be used in that scope, and the statement-list are the actions to be performed. Brackets define their own scope, and variables defined inside those brackets will be automatically
deallocated at the closing bracket. Declarations and statements can be freely intermixed within a compound statement (as in C++).

===Selection statements===
C has two types of selection statements: the statement and the statement.

The statement is in the form:

if (&lt;expression&gt;)
 &lt;statement1&gt;
else
 &lt;statement2&gt;
In the statement, if the in parentheses is nonzero (true), control passes to . If the clause is present and the is zero (false), control will pass to . The part is optional and, if absent, a false will simply result in skipping over the . An always matches the nearest previous unmatched ; braces may be used to override this when necessary, or for clarity.

The statement causes control to be transferred to one of several statements depending on the value of an expression, which must have integral type. The substatement controlled by a switch is typically compound. Any statement within the substatement may be labeled with one or more labels, which consist of the keyword followed by a constant expression and then a colon (:). The syntax is as follows:

switch (&lt;expression&gt;)
 case &lt;label1&gt; :
 &lt;statements 1&gt;
 case &lt;label2&gt; :
 &lt;statements 2&gt;
 break;
 default :
 &lt;statements 3&gt;


No two of the case constants associated with the same switch may have the same value. There may be at most one label associated with a switch. If none of the case labels are equal to the expression in the parentheses following , control passes to the label or, if there is no label, execution resumes just beyond the entire construct.

Switches may be nested; a or label is associated with the innermost that contains it. Switch statements can &quot;fall through&quot;, that is, when one case section has completed its execution, statements will continue to be executed downward until a statement is encountered. Fall-through is useful in some circumstances, but is usually not desired.
In the preceding example, if is reached, the statements are executed and nothing more inside the braces. However, if is reached, both and are executed since there is no to separate the two case statements.

It is possible, although unusual, to insert the labels into the sub-blocks of other control structures. Examples of this include Duff&#x27;s device and Simon Tatham&#x27;s implementation of coroutines in Putty.

===Iteration statements===
C has three forms of iteration statement:

do
 &lt;statement&gt;
while ( &lt;expression&gt; ) ;

while ( &lt;expression&gt; )
 &lt;statement&gt;

for ( &lt;expression&gt; ; &lt;expression&gt; ; &lt;expression&gt; )
 &lt;statement&gt;
In the  and statements, the sub-statement is executed repeatedly so long as the value of the remains non-zero (equivalent to true). With , the test, including all side effects from , occurs before each iteration (execution of ); with , the test occurs after each iteration. Thus, a statement always executes its sub-statement at least once, whereas may not execute the sub-statement at all.

The statement:

for (e1; e2; e3)
 s;

is equivalent to:

e1;
while (e2)
 s;
cont:
 e3;

except for the behaviour of a statement (which in the loop jumps to instead of ). If is blank, it would have to be replaced with a .

Any of the three expressions in the loop may be omitted. A missing second expression makes the test always non-zero, creating a potentially infinite loop.

Since C99, the first expression may take the form of a declaration, typically including an initializer, such as:

for (int i = 0; i &lt; limit; ++i) {
}
The declaration&#x27;s scope is limited to the extent of the loop.

===Jump statements===
Jump statements transfer control unconditionally. There are four types of jump statements in C: , , , and .

The statement looks like this:

goto &lt;identifier&gt; ;
The identifier must be a label (followed by a colon) located in the current function. Control transfers to the labeled statement.

A statement may appear only within an iteration statement and causes control to pass to the loop-continuation portion of the innermost enclosing iteration statement. That is, within each of the statements
while (expression)
 /* ... */
 cont: ;

do
 /* ... */
 cont: ;
} while (expression);

for (expr1; expr2; expr3) {
 cont: ;


a not contained within a nested iteration statement is the same as .

The statement is used to end a loop, loop, loop, or statement. Control passes to the statement following the terminated statement.

A function returns to its caller by the statement. When is followed by an expression, the value is returned to the caller as the value of the function. Encountering the end of the function is equivalent to a with no expression. In that case, if the function is declared as returning a value and the caller tries to use the returned value, the result is undefined.

====Storing the address of a label====
GCC extends the C language with a unary operator that returns the address of a label. This address can be stored in a variable type and may be used later in a instruction. For example, the following prints in an infinite loop:
 void *ptr = &amp;&amp;J1;

J1: printf(&quot;hi &quot;);
 goto *ptr;
This feature can be used to implement a jump table.

==Functions==

===Syntax===
A C function definition consists of a return type ( if no value is returned), a unique name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and various statements:

&lt;return-type&gt; functionName( &lt;parameter-list&gt; )
 &lt;statements&gt;
 return &lt;expression of type return-type&gt;;


A function with non- return type should include at least one statement. The parameters are given by the , a comma-separated list of parameter declarations, each item in the list being a data type followed by an identifier: .

The return type cannot be an array type or function type.

int f()[3]; // Error: function returning an array
int (*g())[3]; // OK: function returning a pointer to an array.

void h()(); // Error: function returning a function
void (*k())(); // OK: function returning a function pointer
If there are no parameters, the may be left empty or optionally be specified with the single word .

It is possible to define a function as taking a variable number of parameters by providing the keyword as the last parameter instead of a data type ad variable identifier. A commonly used function that does this is the standard library function , which has the declaration:

int printf (const char*, ...);
Manipulation of these parameters can be done by using the routines in the standard library header .

====Function Pointers====
A pointer to a function can be declared as follows:

&lt;return-type&gt; (*&lt;function-name&gt;)(&lt;parameter-list&gt;);
The following program shows use of a function pointer for selecting between addition and subtraction:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int (*operation)(int x, int y);

int add(int x, int y)
 return x + y;

int subtract(int x, int y)
 return x - y;

int main(int argc, char* args[])
 int foo = 1, bar = 1;

 operation = add;
 printf(&quot;%d + %d = %d\n&quot;, foo, bar, operation(foo, bar));
 operation = subtract;
 printf(&quot;%d - %d = %d\n&quot;, foo, bar, operation(foo, bar));
 return 0;


===Global structure===
After preprocessing, at the highest level a C program consists of a sequence of declarations at file scope. These may be partitioned into several separate source files, which may be compiled separately; the resulting object modules are then linked along with implementation-provided run-time support modules to produce an executable image.

The declarations introduce functions, variables and types. C functions are akin to the subroutines of Fortran or the procedures of Pascal.

A &quot;definition&quot; is a special type of declaration. A variable definition sets aside storage and possibly initializes it, a function definition provides its body.

An implementation of C providing all of the standard library functions is called a &quot;hosted implementation&quot;. Programs written for hosted implementations are required to define a special function called , which is the first function called when a program begins executing.

Hosted implementations start program execution by invoking the function, which must be defined following one of these prototypes (using different parameter names or spelling the types differently is allowed):
int main() {...}
int main(void) {...}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {...}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {...} // char *argv[] and char **argv have the same type as function parameters
The first two definitions are equivalent (and both are compatible with C++). It is probably up to individual preference which one is used (the current C standard contains two examples of and two of , but the draft C++ standard uses ). The return value of (which should be ) serves as &quot;termination status&quot; returned to the host environment.

The C standard defines return values and as indicating success and as indicating failure. ( and are defined in ). Other return values have implementation-defined meanings; for example, under Linux a program killed by a signal yields a return code of the numerical value of the signal plus 128.

A minimal correct C program consists of an empty routine, taking no arguments and doing nothing:

int main(void){}
Because no codice_26 statement is present, codice_27 returns 0 on exit. (This is a special-case feature introduced in C99 that applies only to codice_27.)

The function will usually call other functions to help it perform its job.

Some implementations are not hosted, usually because they are not intended to be used with an operating system. Such implementations are called &quot;free-standing&quot; in the C standard. A free-standing implementation is free to specify how it handles program startup; in particular it need not require a program to define a function.

Functions may be written by the programmer or provided by existing libraries. Interfaces for the latter are usually declared by including header files—with the preprocessing directive—and the library objects are linked into the final executable image. Certain library functions, such as , are defined by the C standard; these are referred to as the standard library functions.

A function may return a value to caller (usually another C function, or the hosting environment for the function ). The function mentioned above returns how many characters were printed, but this value is often ignored.

===Argument passing===
In C, arguments are passed to functions by value while other languages may pass variables by reference. This means that the receiving function gets copies of the values and has no direct way of altering the original variables. For a function to alter a variable passed from another function, the caller must pass its &quot;address&quot; (a &quot;pointer&quot; to it), which can then be dereferenced in the receiving function. See Pointers for more information.
void incInt(int *y)
 (*y)++; // Increase the value of &#x27;x&#x27;, in &#x27;main&#x27; below, by one

int main(void)
 int x = 0;
 incInt(&amp;x); // pass a reference to the var &#x27;x&#x27;
 return 0;


The function scanf works the same way:

int x;
scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;x);
In order to pass an editable pointer to a function (such as for the purpose of returning an allocated array to the calling code) you have to pass a pointer to &quot;that&quot; pointer: its address.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void allocate_array(int ** const a_p, const int A) {
 allocate array of A ints
 assigning to *a_p alters the &#x27;a&#x27; in main()
 *a_p = malloc(sizeof(int) * A); 

int main(void) {
 int * a; /* create a pointer to one or more ints, this will be the array */

 /* pass the address of &#x27;a&#x27; */
 allocate_array(&amp;a, 42);

/* &#x27;a&#x27; is now an array of length 42 and can be manipulated and freed here */

 free(a);
 return 0;


The parameter is a pointer to a pointer to an , which is the address of the pointer defined in the &quot;main&quot; function in this case.

====Array parameters====
Function parameters of array type may at first glance appear to be an exception to C&#x27;s pass-by-value rule. The following program will print 2, not 1:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void setArray(int array[], int index, int value)
 array[index] = value;

int main(void)
 int a[1] = {1};
 setArray(a, 0, 2);
 printf (&quot;a[0]=%d\n&quot;, a[0]);
 return 0;


However, there is a different reason for this behavior. In fact, a function parameter declared with an array type is treated like one declared to be a pointer. That is, the preceding declaration of is equivalent to the following:

void setArray(int *array, int index, int value)
At the same time, C rules for the use of arrays in expressions cause the value of in the call to to be converted to a pointer to the first element of array . Thus, in fact this is still an example of pass-by-value, with the caveat that it is the address of the first element of the array being passed by value, not the contents of the array.

Since C99, the programmer can specify that a function takes an array of a certain size by using the keyword . In codice_29 the first parameter must be a pointer to the first element of an array of length at least 4. It is also possible to add qualifiers (codice_6, codice_31 and codice_32) to the pointer type that the array is converted to by putting them between the brackets.

===Anonymous functions===
==Miscellaneous==

===Reserved keywords===
The following words are reserved, and may not be used as identifiers:

:
:
:
:
:
:

:
:
:
:
:

:
:
:
:
:

: 
:
:
:
Implementations may reserve other keywords, such as , although implementations typically provide non-standard keywords that begin with one or two underscores.

===Case sensitivity===
C identifiers are case sensitive (e.g., , , and are the names of different objects). Some linkers may map external identifiers to a single case, although this is uncommon in most modern linkers.

===Comments===
Text starting with the token is treated as a comment and ignored. The comment ends at the next ; it can occur within expressions, and can span multiple lines. Accidental omission of the comment terminator is problematic in that the next comment&#x27;s properly constructed comment terminator will be used to terminate the initial comment, and all code in between the comments will be considered as a comment. C-style comments do not nest; that is, accidentally placing a comment within a comment has unintended results:
/*
This line will be ignored.
A compiler warning may be produced here. These lines will also be ignored.
The comment opening token above did not start a new comment,
and the comment closing token below will close the comment begun on line 1.
This line and the line below it will not be ignored. Both will likely produce compile errors.


C++ style line comments start with and extend to the end of the line. This style of comment originated in BCPL and became valid C syntax in C99; it is not available in the original K&amp;R C nor in ANSI C:
// this line will be ignored by the compiler

/* these lines
 will be ignored
 by the compiler */

x = *p/*q; /* this comment starts after the &#x27;p&#x27; */
===Command-line arguments===
The parameters given on a command line are passed to a C program with two predefined variables - the count of the command-line arguments in and the individual arguments as character strings in the pointer array . So the command:

 myFilt p1 p2 p3

results in something like:
While individual strings are arrays of contiguous characters, there is no guarantee that the strings are stored as a contiguous group.

The name of the program, , may be useful when printing diagnostic messages or for making one binary serve multiple purposes. The individual values of the parameters may be accessed with , , and , as shown in the following program:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 printf(&quot;argc\t= %d\n&quot;, argc);
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++)
 printf(&quot;argv[%i]\t= %s\n&quot;, i, argv[i]);


===Evaluation order===
In any reasonably complex expression, there arises a choice as to the order in which to evaluate the parts of the expression: may be evaluated in the order , , , , or in the order , , , . Formally, a conforming C compiler may evaluate expressions in &quot;any&quot; order between &quot;sequence points&quot; (this allows the compiler to do some optimization). Sequence points are defined by:
* &quot;Statement ends&quot; at semicolons.
* The &quot;sequencing operator&quot;: a comma. However, commas that delimit function arguments are not sequence points.
* The &quot;short-circuit operators&quot;: logical &quot;and&quot; (, which can be read &quot;and then&quot;) and logical &quot;or&quot; (codice_33, which can be read &quot;or else&quot;).
* The &quot;ternary operator&quot; (): This operator evaluates its first sub-expression first, and then its second or third (never both of them) based on the value of the first.
* Entry to and exit from a &quot;function call&quot; (but not between evaluations of the arguments).

Expressions before a sequence point are always evaluated before those after a sequence point. In the case of short-circuit evaluation, the second expression may not be evaluated depending on the result of the first expression. For example, in the expression , if the first argument evaluates to nonzero (true), the result of the entire expression cannot be anything else than true, so is not evaluated. Similarly, in the expression , if the first argument evaluates to zero (false), the result of the entire expression cannot be anything else than false, so is not evaluated.

The arguments to a function call may be evaluated in any order, as long as they are all evaluated by the time the function is entered. The following expression, for example, has undefined behavior:

 printf(&quot;%s %s\n&quot;, argv[i = 0], argv[++i]);
===Undefined behavior===
An aspect of the C standard (not unique to C) is that the behavior of certain code is said to be &quot;undefined&quot;. In practice, this means that the program produced from this code can do anything, from working as the programmer intended, to crashing every time it is run.

For example, the following code produces undefined behavior, because the variable &quot;b&quot; is modified more than once with no intervening sequence point:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
 int b = 1;
 int a = b++ + b++;
 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, a);


Because there is no sequence point between the modifications of &quot;b&quot; in &quot;&quot;b&quot;++ + &quot;b&quot;++&quot;, it is possible to perform the evaluation steps in more than one order, resulting in an ambiguous statement. This can be fixed by rewriting the code to insert a sequence point in order to enforce an unambiguous behavior, for example:
a = b++;
a += b++;

<text>The OKB-1 &#x27;140&#x27;, (sometimes known as &#x27;001&#x27;) was a jet bomber produced in the USSR from 1947.

== Development ==
The &#x27;140&#x27; was a reconnaissance/bomber aircraft, derived from the OKB-1 EF 131 with Soviet turbojet engines. The initial version, a tactical jet bomber with a secondary reconnaissance role, was initiated as the EF-140 by Dr. Brunolf Baade, at OKB-1, in 1947. The six Jumo 004 engines of the EF-131 were replaced by two Mikulin AM-TKRD-01 axial flow turbojets, rated at 32.372 kN (7,280 lb) thrust, in large nacelles attached to the underside of the wing at the same position.

Using the airframe of the second EF-131 prototype, the &#x27;140&#x27; was very similar in appearance, and to its forebear Junkers Ju 287, with the classic Junkers-style crew compartment in the nose, wings swept forward 19°50&#x27; with marked dihedral, and the underslung engine nacelles extending forward of the leading-edge. Construction was of aluminium alloy stressed skin, with a semi-monocoque fuselage, wings with multiple spars covered with stressed skin panels, and high strength steel for highly stressed parts. Defensive armament consisted of VDB-6 dorsal and NDB-1M ventral remotely controlled turrets controlled by the gunner, in the rear of the crew compartment, using upper and lower periscopes.

The prototype was completed quickly and ready for flight tests by late September 1948 after being disassembled and transported to Tyoply Stan airfield on the outskirts of Moscow. The first flight took place on 30 September 1948, but early test flights were disrupted by severe problems with the fuel control units of the AM-TKRD-01 engines. A replacement set was fitted and testing continued until the manufacturer&#x27;s tests were completed on 24 May 1949.

Council of Ministers directive No. 1886-696 called for development of 140 as a tactical reconnaissance aircraft powered by two Klimov VK-1 centrifugal flow turbo-jets. During the design work for the &#x27;140-R&#x27; the deficiencies highlighted by flight testing of the &#x27;140&#x27; were addressed as well as the addition of wingtip-mounted fuel tanks and new nacelles for the VK-1 engines, and the fitting of DT-V1 and DT-N1 turrets, replacing those of the &#x27;140&#x27;, armed with 2 × 23mm cannon each. Flight testing of &#x27;140-R&#x27; commenced on 20 October at a specially built airfield near the GOZ-1 factory at Borki, (the German workers were not admitted to Tyoplyy Stan for security reasons), where four flights were carried out, all of which suffered from severe vibration of the wings.

The final variant of &#x27;140&#x27; was the &#x27;140-B/R&#x27;, which was a reconnaissance bomber, powered by the same engines but with increased weight and reduced performance. Design work, static tests and construction were complete and ground testing of the aircraft partially completed when all work on &#x27;140-R&#x27; and &#x27;140-B/R&#x27; aircraft was terminated by the Council of Ministers&#x27; directive No. 2474-974 issued on 18 June 1950.

== Variants ==

;&quot;140&quot;:The initial prototype tactical jet bomber utilising the airframe of the second EF-131 with two Mikulin AM-TKRD-01 turbojet engines.
;&quot;140-R&quot;: Converted from &#x27;140&#x27;, the &#x27;140-R&#x27; was a reconnaissance aircraft powered by Klimov VK-1 engines and various improvements highlighted by flight testing of &#x27;140&#x27;.
;&quot;140-B/R&quot;: A second &#x27;140 airframe, completed as a reconnaissance-bomber, which had partially completed ground tests, prior to flight testing, when the programme was cancelled.

<text>The aloha shirt (), also referred to as a Hawaiian shirt, is a style of dress shirt originating in Hawaii. They are collared and buttoned dress shirts, usually short-sleeved and made from printed fabric. They are traditionally worn untucked, but can be worn tucked into the waist of trousers. They are worn casually or as informal business attire in Hawaii.

&quot;Aloha Friday&quot;, or Casual Friday, a now-common tradition of celebrating the end of the workweek by wearing more casual attire on Fridays, initially grew out of an effort to promote aloha shirts.

== Design ==
Aloha dress shirts are printed, mostly short-sleeved, and collared. They almost always have buttons, sometimes for the entire length of the shirt or at least up to the chest. They usually have a left chest pocket sewn in, often with attention to ensure the printed pattern remains continuous. Aloha shirts may be worn by men or women. Women&#x27;s aloha shirts usually have a lower-cut, v-neck style.

The lower hems are straight, and the shirts are often worn with the shirt-tails hanging out, rather than tucked in. Wearing an untucked shirt was possibly influenced by the local Filipinos who wore shirt-tail out, and called these meaning &quot;friend&quot;. Wearing it untucked or tucked depends on personal taste; it carries the same connotations of tucking or untucking a polo shirt. In the 1950s, the shirt became allowed as business attire for aloha week, but only if worn tucked in. 

Traditional men&#x27;s aloha shirts are usually adorned with traditional Hawaiian quilt designs, tapa designs, and simple floral patterns in more muted colors. Contemporary aloha shirts may have prints that do not feature any traditional Hawaiian quilt or floral designs but instead may incorporate drinks, palm trees, surf boards or other island tropical elements in a similar form as the traditional aloha shirt.

It has been observed that locals (kamaʻāina) tended to shy away from the garishness of aloha shirts as &quot;too wild&quot; when they first appeared, whereas tourists embraced wearing designs of many bright colors. An example of the type of shirt the locals may prefer includes the &quot;reverse print&quot;; these shirts are often printed on the interior, resulting in the muted color on the exterior.

== History ==

According to some sources, the origin of aloha shirts can be traced to the 1920s or the early 1930s, when the Honolulu-based dry goods store &quot;Musa-Shiya the Shirtmaker&quot; under the proprietorship of Kōichirō Miyamoto, started making shirts out of colorful Japanese prints. It has also been contended that the aloha shirt was devised in the early 1930s by Chinese merchant Ellery Chun of &quot;King-Smith Clothiers and Dry Goods&quot;, a store in Waikiki. Although this claim has been described as a myth reinforced by repeated telling, Chun may have been the first to mass-produce or to maintain the ready-to-wear in stock to be sold off the shelf.

The name &quot;aloha shirt&quot; appeared later. By 1935 and 1936, the word &quot;aloha&quot; was being attached to various sorts of Hawaiian products, so calling the garments &quot;aloha shirts&quot; was hardly original. The term aloha shirt first appeared in print in an advertisement for Musa-Shiya in the June 28, 1935 issue of &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; newspaper. However, Ellery Chun is sometimes credited for coining the term, perhaps in 1933; Chun&#x27;s store reportedly carried window signs that said &quot;aloha shirts&quot;. The term &quot;aloha sportswear&quot; was registered as a trademark by Chun&#x27;s company in 1936, followed by Chun trademarking &quot;Aloha Shirt&quot; in 1937 and owning the rights to this appellation for the next 20 years.

Within years, major designer labels sprang up all over Hawaii and began manufacturing and selling aloha shirts en masse. By the end of the 1930s, 450 people were employed in an industry worth $600,000 annually. Two notable manufacturers of this period are Kamehameha and Branfleet (later Kahala), both founded in 1936. Retail chains in Hawaii, including some based on the mainland, may mass-produce a single aloha shirt design for employee uniforms.

After World War II, many servicemen and servicewomen returned to the United States from Asia and the Pacific islands with aloha shirts made in Hawaii since the 1930s. One significant manufacturer was Shaheen, which began business in 1948. Following Hawaii&#x27;s statehood in 1959, when extant tropical prints came to be regarded as rather tacky, designer Alfred Shaheen became noted for producing aloha shirts of higher chic and quality, and Elvis Presley wore a Shaheen-designed red aloha on the album cover for &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; (1961). In 1956, Tori Richard, a well-known brand of alohas was established. Spooner&#x27;s of Waikiki, precursor of Reyn Spooner, also established business in 1956.

=== Exports ===
Garments manufactured in Hawaii could bear &quot;Made in Hawaii&quot; labels before statehood (1959), and even afterwards, their sales to mainland United States continued to be referred to as &quot;exports&quot;.

Aloha shirts tend to be referred to as &quot;Hawaiian shirts&quot; by the populace from the mainland United States, and are often brilliantly colored with floral patterns or generic Polynesian motifs.

The aloha shirt is currently the premier textile export of the Hawaii manufacturing industry.

== Aloha dress codes ==
=== Aloha Week ===

In 1946, the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce funded a study of aloha shirts and designs for comfortable business clothing worn during the hot Hawaiian summers. The City and County of Honolulu passed a resolution allowing their employees to wear sport shirts from June–October. City employees were not allowed to wear aloha shirts for business until the creation of the Aloha Week festival in 1947. The Aloha Week festival was motivated by both cultural and economic concerns: First held at Ala Moana Park in October, the festival revived interest in ancient Hawaiian music, dancing, sports, and traditions. There was a holoku ball, a floral parade, and a makahiki festival attended by 8,000 people. Economically, the week-long event first attracted visitors during October – traditionally a slow month for tourism – which benefited the Hawaiian fashion industry as they supplied the muumuu and aloha shirts worn for the celebration. Aloha Week expanded in 1974 to six islands, and was lengthened to a month. In 1991, Aloha Week was renamed to Aloha Festivals.

In the end, Aloha Week had a direct influence on the resulting demand for alohawear, and was responsible for supporting local clothing manufacturing: locals needed the clothing for the festivals, and soon people in Hawaii began wearing the clothing in greater numbers on more of a daily basis. Hawaii&#x27;s fashion industry was relieved, as they were initially worried that popular clothing from the mainland United States would eventually replace aloha attire.

=== Aloha Friday ===

In 1962, a professional manufacturing association known as the Hawaiian Fashion Guild began to promote aloha shirts and clothing for use in the workplace, particularly as business attire. In a campaign called &quot;Operation Liberation&quot;, the Guild distributed two aloha shirts to every member of the Hawaii House of Representatives and the Hawaii Senate. Subsequently, a resolution passed in the Senate recommending aloha attire be worn throughout the summer, beginning on Lei Day. The wording of the resolution spoke of letting &quot;the male populace return to &#x27;aloha attire&#x27; during the summer months for the sake of comfort and in support of the 50th state&#x27;s garment industry&quot;.

In 1965, Bill Foster Sr., president of the Hawaii Fashion Guild, led the organization in a campaign lobbying for &quot;Aloha Friday&quot;, a day employers would allow men to wear aloha shirts on the last business day of the week a few months out of the year. Aloha Friday officially began in 1966, and young adults of the 1960s embraced the style, replacing the formal business wear favored by previous generations. By 1970, aloha wear had gained acceptance in Hawaii as business attire for any day of the week. Unlike the court dress required in most jurisdictions, attorneys in Hawaii may be allowed to wear aloha shirts in court, though this varies among individual courts.

Hawaii&#x27;s custom of Aloha Friday slowly spread east to California, continuing around the globe until the 1990s, when it became known as Casual Friday. Today in Hawaii, alohawear is worn as business attire for any day of the week, and &quot;Aloha Friday&quot; is generally used to refer to the last day of the work week. Now considered Hawaii&#x27;s term for &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot; (TGIF), the phrase was used by Kimo Kahoano and Paul Natto in their 1982 song, &quot;It&#x27;s Aloha Friday, No Work &#x27;til Monday&quot;, heard every Friday on Hawaii radio stations across the state.

=== Aloha attire ===
The related concept of &quot;aloha attire&quot; stems from the aloha shirt. Semi-formal functions such as weddings, birthday parties, and dinners are often designated as &quot;aloha attire&quot;, meaning that men wear aloha shirts and women wear muumuu or other tropical prints. Because Hawaii tends to be more casual, it is rarely appropriate to attend such functions in full evening wear like on the mainland; instead, aloha attire is seen as a happy medium between excessive formality and casual wear (i.e., business casual).

<text>USS &quot;Grenadier&quot; (SS-210), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the grenadier fish, relatives of cod that are very common in bathyal and abyssal habitats.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Grenadier&quot;′s keel was laid down by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, in April 1940. She was launched on 29 November 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Virginia E. Anderson, wife of Rear Admiral Walter S. Anderson, Director of Naval Intelligence. &quot;Grenadier&quot; was commissioned on 1 May 1941 with Lieutenant Commander Allen R. Joyce in command.

==Pre-World War II service==

On 20 June 1941 &quot;Grenadier&quot; participated in the search for , which had failed to surface after a deep test dive, and was present two days later as memorial exercises were conducted over the spot where &quot;O-9&quot; and her crew lay. After shakedown in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Grenadier&quot; returned to Portsmouth on 5 November for refit. Less than three weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she sailed for the Pacific to join the submarine fleet.

==COMSUBPAC patrols, 1942==

&quot;Grenadier&quot;″s first war patrol from 4 February to 23 March 1942 took her near the Japanese home islands, off the coast of Honshū, and brought her several targets but no sinkings. On 12 April &quot;Grenadier,&quot; now under command of Lieutenant Commander Willis Lent, departed Pearl Harbor for her second war patrol, along the Shanghai-Yokohama and Nagasaki-Formosa shipping lanes. On 8 May she torpedoed and sank one of her most important victories of the war, transport . Post-war examination of Japanese records showed &quot;Taiyō Maru&quot; to be more than just the ordinary transport; she was en route to the East Indies with a group of Japanese scientists, economists, and industrial experts, including renowned hydraulic engineer Yoichi Hatta who designed Chianan Irrigation and built Wusanto Reservoir in Taiwan, bent on expediting the exploitation of the conquered territory. Their loss was a notable blow to the Japanese war effort.

On 1 May 1942, &quot;Grenadier&quot; mistakenly sank the Soviet merchant ship &quot;Angarstroi&quot; in the East China Sea about west-southwest of Nagasaki, Japan.

On 25 May 1942, &quot;Grenadier&quot; was diverted from her patrol area to Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where she formed part of the submarine patrol line as the American fleet in a bloody but brilliant battle handed the Imperial Navy its first defeat in some three hundred years. &quot;Grenadier&quot;″s third war patrol was in the Truk area, heavily patrolled by enemy ships and planes. Although she sighted some 28 Japanese ships, enemy planes effectively hampered her, and she returned to her new base, Fremantle, Australia, empty-handed.

==Deployment to Australia==

The Malay Barrier was the site of &quot;Grenadier&quot;″s fourth war patrol from 13 October to 10 December. After laying a minefield off Haiphong, Indochina, the submarine made an unsuccessful attack on a large freighter. During the severe depth charging which followed, sea water seeped into the batteries; &quot;Grenadier&quot;″s crew suffered headaches and nausea from chlorine gas poisoning for the remainder of the patrol. On 12 November, she attacked and sank by torpedo the rescue tug () off the coast of French Indochina at . To increase the misery, on 20 November &quot;Grenadier&quot; spotted a -class aircraft carrier, escorted by a cruiser and a destroyer, heading through the Strait of Makassar too distant to shoot. &quot;Grenadier&quot; surfaced to radio the aircraft carrier&#x27;s location and course to Fremantle submarine base in hope that another submarine could capitalize on it.

&quot;Grenadier&quot;″s fifth war patrol, under the command of Lieutenant Commander John Allison Fitzgerald, between 1 January and 20 February 1943, brought her considerably better fortune than earlier patrols. A 75-ton schooner fell victim to &quot;Grenadier&#x27;s&quot; deck guns 10 January, and two days later &quot;Grenadier&quot; sighted a small tanker with a barge in tow. Judging the target not worth a torpedo, she slipped silently into the column behind the two Japanese ships. At dusk she battle surfaced. With binoculars lashed to the deck guns as sights, she raked the tanker and barge, sinking them immediately. The remainder of her patrol, along the Borneo coast through shallow and treacherous waters, was hampered by fathometer failures. She conducted an aggressive attack on two cargo ships 22 January but did not sink them.

The submarine departed Australia on 20 March on her last war patrol and headed for the Strait of Malacca, gateway between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Patrolling along the Malay and Thai coasts, &quot;Grenadier&quot; claimed a small freighter off the island of Phuket on 6 April.

==Loss==
&quot;Grenadier&quot; remained in the area and late on the night of 20 April 1943 sighted two merchant ships and closed in for the attack. Running on the surface at dawn on 21 April, &quot;Grenadier&quot; spotted, and was simultaneously spotted by, a Japanese airplane. The submarine dived, and as she passed her executive officer commented, &quot;We ought to be safe now.&quot; Just then, explosions rocked &quot;Grenadier&quot; and heeled her over 15 to 20 degrees. Power and lights failed completely and the fatally wounded ship settled to the bottom at . She tried to make repairs while a fierce fire blazed in the maneuvering room.

After 13 hours of sweating it out on the bottom, &quot;Grenadier&quot; managed to surface after dark to clear the submarine of smoke and inspect damage. The damage to her propulsion system was irreparable. Attempting to bring his ship closer to shore so that the crew could scuttle her and escape into the jungle, Fitzgerald even tried to jury-rig a sail. But the long night&#x27;s work proved futile. As dawn broke on 22 April, &quot;Grenadier&quot;″s weary crew sighted two Japanese ships heading for them. One, the netlayer , began ineffective shelling. Fitzgerald &quot;didn&#x27;t think it advisable to make a stationary dive in of water without power,&quot; and the crew began burning confidential documents prior to abandoning ship. A Japanese airplane attacked the stricken submarine, but &quot;Grenadier&quot;, although dead in the water and to all appearances helpless, blazed away with her machine guns. She hit the plane on its second pass. As the damaged plane veered off, its torpedo landed about from the boat and exploded. Opening all vents, the crew of &quot;Grenadier&quot; abandoned ship and watched her sink to her final resting place. &quot;Choko Maru&quot; picked up eight officers and 68 enlisted men and took them to Penang, Malay States, where they were questioned, beaten, and starved before being sent to other prison camps. They were then separated and transferred from camp to camp along the Malay Peninsula and finally to Japan. Throughout the war they suffered brutal, inhumane treatment, and their refusal to reveal military information frustrated and angered their captors. The first word that any of &quot;Grenadier&quot;′s crew had survived her sinking reached Australia on 27 November 1943. Despite their brutal and sadistic treatment, all but four of &quot;Grenadier&quot;″s crew survived their two years in Japanese hands.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Grenadier&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

==Discovery of wreck==
A sunken wreck identified as the &quot;Grenadier&quot; was found by a team of four divers—Jean Luc Rivoire, Lance Horowitz, Benoit Laborie and Ben Reymenants—sitting upright under about of water and partly covered in fishing nets. Announced in 2020, the discovery of the wreck came in a series of dives as part of a six-month, $110,000 expedition beginning in October 2019. The divers sent their findings to the Naval History and Heritage Command for verification; confirmation will place the wreck under the protections of the Sunken Military Craft Act.

<text>Barbarous radiates are imitations of the &quot;antoninianus&quot;, a type of coin issued during the Roman Empire, which are so named due to their crude style and prominent radiant crown worn by the emperor.

Barbarous radiates were issued privately primarily during the Crisis of the Third Century (c. 259–274 AD) in the western provinces. They are not generally regarded as forgeries since they were rarely deceptive because they were smaller and cruder than standard issues. They probably functioned as small change.

Although earlier numismatists, notably Philip V. Hill, theorized that barbarous radiates were produced long after their prototypes and into the Dark Ages and Saxon period, more recent works argue that they were generally contemporary to their prototypes.

According to Hill, in England, although barbarous radiates were clearly produced at several different locations, hoard evidence demonstrate local styles. For example, in northern England there was a greater affinity towards producing barbarous radiates with reverse figures with relief-less outlines, while in southern England bolder, fuller, high relief figures were more common. Similar &quot;schools of art&quot; exist for pieces produced in continental Europe.

Due to their unofficial manufacture, barbarous radiates exhibit many peculiarities. Reverse types portray a certain deity or personification, for example Spes, might feature a reverse legend instead for Pietas. On some specimens the devices normally associated with one deity or personification is shown with a different deity or personification. For example, the sceptre, which is normally a device of Pax, is instead shown with Pietas. The result is a generic reverse personification or deity.

Legends of barbarous radiates range from correct and exact copies of the prototype, to a jumble of unintelligible, meaningless letters and symbols. Smaller pieces known as minims, which are less than 10 mm in diameter, are often anepigraphic (without markings/lettering). For very degraded barbarous imitations, there is a tendency to emphasize a particular feature of the prototype, in this case the radiate crown.

The most frequently imitated prototypes are of the Gallic emperors the Tetrici (270–273), Tetricus I and his son, Tetricus II. The next most frequent are those of Claudius II (270), especially the posthumous issue with the altar reverse, and Victorinus (268-270). Imitations of Postumus antoniniani are scarce, although imitations of his large bronzes (such as the double &quot;sestertius&quot;) are relatively common. Other uncommon to rare types in order of frequency are Gallienus, Quintillus, Probus, Aurelian, and Tacitus.

<text>Twaron (a brand name of Teijin Aramid) is a para-aramid, high-performance yarn. It is a heat-resistant fibre, helps in ballistic protection and cut protection. Twaron was developed in the early 1970s by the Dutch company Akzo Nobel&#x27;s division Enka BV, later Akzo Industrial Fibers. The research name of the para-aramid fibre was originally Fiber X, but it was soon called Arenka. Although the Dutch para-aramid fiber was developed only a little later than DuPont&#x27;s Kevlar, the introduction of Twaron as a commercial product came much later than Kevlar due to financial problems at the Akzo company in the 1970s. As of 2000, Twaron had become a global material and had been integrated into the global markets. Twaron has been around for over 30 years.

==History==
This is a chronology of the development of Twaron:
* In 1960s a research program starts for &quot;Fiber X.&quot;
* In 1972 the ENKA Research laboratory develops a para-aramid called Arenka.
* In 1973 Akzo decides to use sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a solvent for spinning.
* In 1974 New process route was found at Akzo Research laboratory, using N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) with a co-solvent (auxiliary solvent) with an ionic component (Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups in order to dissolve the aromatic polymer.
* In 1976 a pilot plant is built.
* In 1977 first production starts.
* In 1984 the product is renamed Twaron.
* In 1986 commercial production is started at five locations and nine plants.
* In 1987 Twaron is introduced as a commercial product.
* In 1989 the aramid business of Akzo becomes an independent Business Unit called Twaron BV.
* Since 2000 Twaron BV has been owned by the Teijin Group, now called Teijin Twaron BV and based in Arnhem, Netherlands. The main production facilities for Twaron are in Emmen and Delfzijl.
* In 2007 Teijin Twaron expands for the fourth time in six years and also changes its name into Teijin Aramid.

==Production==

===Polymer preparation===
Twaron is a &quot;p&quot;-phenylene terephthalamide (P&quot;p&quot;PTA), the simplest form of the AABB para polyaramide. P&quot;p&quot;PTA is a product of &quot;p&quot;-phenylene diamine (PPD) and terephthaloyl dichloride (TDC). To dissolve the aromatic polymer Twaron used a co-solvent of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and an ionic component (calcium chloride CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups. The invention of this specific process was done in 1974 at AKZO Research Laboratory in Arnhem by a team consisting of Leo Vollbracht, Teun Veerman (assistant of Leo Vollbracht) and Wim Engelhard (trainee, who actually discovered NMP as the appropriate solvent to keep the growing polymer as long as possible in solution; he also discovered that high speed mixing of PPD and TDC was necessary to obtain a sufficiently long polymer chains). The patent of the newly discovered process route led to a patent war between AKZO (Fibre X) and DuPont (Fibre B) as Dupont initially used the carcinogenic HMPT (hexamethylphosphoramide). Despite heavy research DuPont now also applies the AKZO patent for their Kevlar process and use the less hazardous NMP.

===Spinning===
After the production of the Twaron polymer in Delfzijl, the polymer is brought to Emmen, where fibres are produced by spinning the dissolved polymer into a solid fibre from a liquid chemical blend. Polymer solvent for spinning PPTA is generally 100% anhydrous (water free) sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The polymer is dissolved by mixing frozen sulfuric acid in powder form with the polymer in powder form and gently heating the mixture. This process, which differs from the more difficult DuPont process, was invented by Henri Lammers and patented by AKZO.

==Use==
Twaron is a para-aramid and has automotive, construction, sports, aerospace, and military applications, e.g., in modern body armor, fabric, and as an asbestos substitute.

;Protective gear (heat resistant / ballistics): flame-resistant clothing, protective clothing and helmets, cut-fast or heat-hardy gloves, sporting goods, textiles, ballistic vests
;Composites: composite materials, technical paper, asbestos replacement, hot air filtration, sailcloth, speaker woofers, boat hull material, fiber reinforced concrete, drumheads
;Automotive: brake pads, turbo hoses, V-belts and Timing belts, tires that incorporate Sulfron (sulfur modified Twaron), mechanical rubber goods reinforcement
;Linear tension: optical fiber cables (OFC), ropes, wire ropes, electrical cables, umbilical cables, electrical mechanical cable (EMC), reinforced thermoplastic pipes
;Yacht construction: on monohulls and catamarans (such as the Catana 581), the glass fibre hull may have an inner skin of Twaron aramid fabric laminated over the core to increase stiffness and impact resistance.

<text>Xbox Game Studios (previously known as Microsoft Studios, Microsoft Game Studios, and Microsoft Games) is an American video game publisher based in Redmond, Washington. It was established in March 2000, spun out from an internal Games Group, for the development and publishing of video games for Microsoft Windows. It has since expanded to include games and other interactive entertainment for the namesake Xbox platforms, other desktop operating systems, Windows Mobile and other mobile platforms, web-based portals, and other game consoles.

Xbox Game Studios, alongside ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, are part of the Microsoft Gaming division led by Phil Spencer, who is chief executive officer of the division.

== History ==

=== As Microsoft Games and Microsoft Game Studios (2000–2011) ===

In the early 1990s, Microsoft published a few video games. It published subLOGIC&#x27;s &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; and several Microsoft Entertainment Pack compilations of minigames, but was best known for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. In 1992, the company began increasing its focus on games. It announced &quot;Microsoft Golf&quot; for Windows, based on Access Software&#x27;s &quot;Links&quot;, and expanded the games division from two to six people with the intention of commissioning more products from other developers.

Microsoft acquired FASA Interactive in 1999 for its &quot;MechWarrior&quot; game series, Access Software, and Aces Game Studio, which worked on &quot;Flight Simulator&quot;. The Games Group had also established long-term publishing deals with developers like Ensemble Studios (&quot;Age of Empires&quot;, &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;), and Digital Anvil (&quot;Starlancer&quot;). Under Microsoft, FASA Interactive was renamed FASA Studio, and Access Software became Salt Lake Games Studio.

Microsoft transitioned the Games Group into a wholly separate division named Microsoft Games around March 2000, along with other consolidation of games-related projects within Microsoft. This came alongside the public announcement of the first Xbox console, with Microsoft Games to serve as a developer and publisher of titles for both Xbox and Windows. Robbie Bach, who held executive positions in Microsoft&#x27;s entertainment divisions, was named senior vice-president while Ed Fries, a member of the former Games Group and instrumental for some of its acquisitions, was named as vice-president of the new division. Shane Kim served as the division&#x27;s general manager. In 2001, the division was renamed Microsoft Game Studios (MGS).

FASA Studio and Salt Lake Games Studio remained with Microsoft Game Studios. Digital Anvil and Ensemble Studios were acquired by Microsoft in 2000 and 2001, respectively. One of the first major studio acquisitions following the division&#x27;s formation was Bungie in June 2000, in the midst of its development of &quot;&quot;. With the acquisition, &quot;Halo&quot;, which had been planned for release on personal computers, became a Microsoft-published title as well as a launch title for the Xbox on its release in 2001. Turn 10 Studios was established in 2001 for work on the &quot;Forza&quot; series of racing games. In September 2002, Microsoft Game Studios acquired Rare, who had previously extensively developed for Nintendo platforms. In 2003, Microsoft recognized that the EA Sports label was in a far stronger position to develop sports games for the Xbox console, and among realignment steps, laid off about 78 employees within Microsoft Game Studios that were developing sports games in-house, and sold Salt Lake Games Studio, now named Indie Games to Take-Two Interactive in 2004, where it became Indie Built.

Peter Moore was named in 2003 as vice-president of Microsoft&#x27;s Home and Entertainment Division, which included MGS, the Xbox division, and Microsoft&#x27;s home hardware market, reporting to Bach. In addition to pulling big publishers like Electronic Arts to the Xbox platform, Moore tried to push the Xbox in Japan by courting Japanese developers with support from MGS publishing. Such games included &quot;Phantom Dust&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Around 2004, MGS established Carbonated Games as an internal studio for the development of casual games for Microsoft&#x27;s web games portal MSN Games, on the chat client MSN Messenger, and on the Xbox Live platform. Kim and Fries were instrumental for securing MGS&#x27; publishing deal with Lionhead Studios for their 2004 game &quot;Fable&quot;, which would serve as the first major role-playing game on the Xbox platform. Subsequently, in 2006, MGS acquired Lionhead Studios along with the &quot;Fable&quot; properties, as it sought to secure a &quot;Fable&quot; sequel for the upcoming Xbox 360. MGS folded the staff of Digital Anvil into the larger studio in 2005, following the release of 2003&#x27;s &quot;Brute Force&quot;, and closed down the studio entirely in 2006. FASA Studio was closed three-and-a-half months after the May 2007 release of their last game, &quot;Shadowrun&quot;.

In 2007, MGS announced the opening of a European office in Reading, England, headed by general manager Phil Spencer. Moore opted to leave Microsoft in July 2007, so to move back to the San Francisco Bay area with his family and to rejoin Electronic Arts. Don Mattrick was named as his replacement as the new vice-president of the Xbox and Games Business, which included MGS. Later in 2007, Bungie amicably split from MGS to become a privately held independent company, with MGS retaining the rights to the &quot;Halo&quot; property. Bungie continued to develop two additional &quot;Halo&quot; games for MGS, &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot; (2009) and &quot;&quot; (2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra-07/09 reports&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, MGS founded 343 Industries as an internal studio to develop future &quot;Halo&quot; games without Bungie.

In 2008, MGS disbanded Carbonated Games and announced the formation of internal studio Xbox Live Productions to develop &quot;high-quality digital content&quot; for Xbox Live Arcade. Microsoft as a whole announced layoffs of up to 5,000 jobs across all divisions in January 2009 due to slowing sales of personal computers as a result of the Great Recession. Within MGS, the studio had already planned to disband Ensemble Studios after the completion of &quot;Halo Wars&quot; in early 2009, while the new layoffs led MGS to also disband Aces Game Studio. Microsoft acquired Vancouver-based BigPark in May 2009, using the studio to develop some of the first games for the upcoming Kinect sensor for the Xbox 360. Later in 2009, Phil Spencer was promoted to corporate vice-president of MGS, in order to replace the retiring Shane Kim. In 2010, MGS formed a mobile gaming studio, MGS Mobile Gaming, focused on developing gaming and entertainment multimedia for Windows Phone devices. It also expanded Rare with a second studio in Digbeth, Birmingham.

=== As Microsoft Studios (2011–2019) ===
By the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 in June 2011, Microsoft Game Studios was quietly renamed to Microsoft Studios. Later in 2011, Microsoft Studios acquired Twisted Pixel Games. In early December 2011, Microsoft Studios created Microsoft Casual Games, a division to revamp its past casual games for Windows (like &quot;Windows Solitaire&quot; and MSN Games) using more up-to-date software delivery platforms.

In 2012, Phil Harrison, the former Sony worldwide studios head, joined Microsoft as head of Microsoft Studios Europe and IEB. Microsoft Studios acquired developer Press Play, known for developing &quot;Tentacles&quot; and &quot;Max &amp; the Magic Marker&quot;. They also announced a new development studio in London, England. Later in 2012, Microsoft downsized Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver due to the cancellation of the Kinect family title &quot;Project Columbia&quot; and announced that the ongoing development of free-to-play title &quot;Microsoft Flight&quot; had been ceased due to portfolio evaluation. The reduced Vancouver studios were renamed to Black Tusk Studios and tasked with making similar franchise-building title as &quot;Halo&quot;.

In 2013, Microsoft established European studio Lift London, a studio that would create cloud-based games for tablets, mobiles and TVs. Later, they created a new &quot;Deep Tech&quot; team inside its Developer and Platform Evangelism (DPE) unit; the new team is charged with working with top developers outside the company to build next-generation applications on top of Microsoft platforms.

While Mattrick had overseen much of the development of Microsoft&#x27;s next console, the Xbox One, he left in July 2013, prior to its release, to take over as CEO of Zynga. Mattrick was succeeded by Julie Larson-Green, who was named the president of the Devices and Studios Engineering Group, following a realignment of Microsoft&#x27;s divisions, overseeing both the Xbox hardware divisions and Microsoft Studios.

==== Shifting priorities under Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ====

Satya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in February 2014. At this time, Microsoft was facing strong competition in the consumer market, and within the gaming sector, the Xbox One (released in 2013) was more expensive than competitors and had too much focus on non-gaming functions. Under Nadella&#x27;s direction, Phil Spencer was named the new head of Microsoft Studios to replace Jason Holtman, who had only been its lead for the prior six months. Spencer began looking for ways to expand Microsoft Studios to make it a profitable division for Microsoft, and began negotiations for the acquititions of Mojang, the developers behind &quot;Minecraft&quot;, in late 2014. Microsoft spent to acquire the studio, and upon the deal&#x27;s completion in November, the studio&#x27;s key founding personnel, Markus Persson, Jakob Porsér and Carl Manneh, departed Mojang. As a result, Persson became valued around . Microsoft Studios committed to keeping &quot;Minecraft&quot; available across multiple platforms, including rival PlayStation consoles. Matt Booty, the studio&#x27;s corporate vice-president in 2020, said the acquisition of Mojang served as the template for later acquisitions, as Mojang was left to run as an &quot;unplugged studio&quot; with limited integration into the Microsoft corporation, minimizing the disruption of Mojang&#x27;s normal day-to-day business matters nor impeding on the studio&#x27;s freedom.

Additional intellectual property (IP) acquisitions by Microsoft Studios in 2014 included a publishing contract with Undead Labs for their game &quot;State of Decay&quot;, the rights to the &quot;Gears of War&quot; series from Epic Games, and the &quot;Rise of&quot; IP (&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; and &quot;Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends&quot;) from Big Huge Games. Microsoft Studios assigned &quot;Gears of War&quot; to Black Tusk Studios, which was later rebranded in 2015 as The Coalition.

In July 2014, it was announced that Xbox Entertainment Studios would be closed in the following months; the closure was completed by October 29. On March 4, 2015, Microsoft announced that they were merging UK-based studios, Lift London and Soho Productions for further games development, with the amalgam continuing to operate under the Lift London name. On March 7, Microsoft announced at the Game Developers Conference that HoloLens games were coming to Xbox One. On March 9, Microsoft announced that Kudo Tsunoda&#x27;s role was expanding and that he would be the new studio team leader for studios such as Press Play, Lift London and a new internal studio called Decisive Games. Decisive Games was previously mentioned in job postings, saying that they were hiring for work on a &quot;beloved strategy game&quot; for Xbox One and PC, but this is the first public acknowledgement of the team&#x27;s existence as a first-party studio. Twisted Pixel and Microsoft Studios agreed to split in September 2015.

Kudo Tsunoda left the Xbox division in November 2015 for the development of HoloLens and Microsoft Edge, and other projects that could improve means of human interaction, including voice and gesture. Tsunoda&#x27;s role was filled by Hanno Lemke and Shannon Loftis. In 2016, Microsoft was perceived as &quot;unifying PC and Xbox One&quot; platforms. In March 2016, Microsoft canceled development of two major projects: Lionhead&#x27;s &quot;Fable Legends&quot; and Press Play&#x27;s &quot;Project Knoxville&quot;, shuttering both studios in the following months. Around the same time, changes to Microsoft Studios&#x27; website indicated that further studios—BigPark, Good Science Studio, Leap Experience Pioneers (LXP), Function Studios and State of the Art (SOTA)—had been closed, Microsoft Studios clarified that all of them had been consolidated into other Microsoft Studios teams over the past several years.

In September 2017, Spencer was promoted to the senior leadership team, gaining the title of &quot;executive vice-president of gaming&quot;. At this point, Microsoft Studios directly reported to Nadella. In January 2018, Matt Booty was promoted from leader in the &quot;Minecraft&quot; games business to corporate vice-president of Microsoft Studios. On June 10, 2018, during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018, Microsoft announced the acquisitions of Ninja Theory, Playground Games, Undead Labs and Compulsion Games, as well as the opening of a new studio in Santa Monica, California, entitled The Initiative, which would be led by the former Crystal Dynamics studio head Darrell Gallagher. In November, Microsoft Studios announced further acquisitions with Obsidian Entertainment and inXile Entertainment.

=== As Xbox Game Studios (2019–present) ===
The studio rebranded itself on February 5, 2019, as Xbox Game Studios, as to reflect Microsoft&#x27;s intent to use the Xbox brand to support gaming across all the devices it supports. At E3 2019, Xbox Game Studios announced it had acquired Double Fine, and established a new internal studio dedicated to &quot;Age of Empires&quot; headed by Shannon Loftis, bringing their total studio count to fifteen. This studio, later named World&#x27;s Edge, does not directly develop any games, but oversees efforts from external studios, such as Relic Entertainment, Forgotten Empires and Tantalus Media, to assure the series is being developed in the right direction, according to creative director Adam Isgreen.

Booty has stated that with studios like Obsidian, Ninja Theory, and Double Fine, which have traditionally supported multiplatform games, they will determine if it makes sense for their future products to be treated as Microsoft-exclusive content for Xbox and Windows computers, or to allow these to be published across multiple platforms. That decision will be based on a &quot;network effect&quot;, whether having these games on other platforms will better support the franchise and thus worthwhile for Microsoft to help dedicate resources towards it, such as they had with &quot;Minecraft&quot;. Xbox Game Studios has allowed some of the content developed by its studios or that was previously published exclusively for the Xbox and Windows systems to be released on Nintendo systems, notably the Nintendo Switch versions of &quot;Cuphead&quot; from Studio MDHR and &quot;Ori and the Blind Forest&quot; from Moon Studios, and allowing for the titular characters from Rare&#x27;s &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; into &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. However, the division stated that these releases were generally &quot;existing commitments to other platforms&quot; that they allowed studios to honor, but they otherwise have &quot;no plans to further expand our exclusive first party games to other consoles.&quot;

Near the end of 2019, with the combined fifteen studios now under Xbox Game Studios, Booty stated that they now had more games than ever to handle, and were likely not going to acquire any additional studios in the near future, stating &quot;we&#x27;ve been shifting our focus inside Xbox Game Studios from acquisition and growth, to a phase of execution and delivery&quot;. Additionally, as Microsoft started promotion of its fourth-generation of Xbox, including the Xbox Series X, Booty stated that titles developed by Xbox Game Studios in year or two following its release will not be exclusively for the new generation of consoles, but instead will support both Xbox One and the new console, with some games receiving enhanced performance when played on the new console lineup. Booty said that with the large number of studios they had recently acquired, as well as ongoing external partnerships and their Xbox Game Pass service, the Studios are able to support a &quot;breadth of offerings in the portfolio&quot; designed to attract a large number of players. Further, in an interview in November 2020, Phil Spencer said during an interview regarding the future of the Xbox brand that he intends to put more focus on outputting RPGs, which had to that point been underserved.

Microsoft and ZeniMax Media announced on September 21, 2020, that Microsoft planned to acquire ZeniMax and its family of studios, which include Bethesda Game Studios, Arkane Studios, id Software, MachineGames, Tango Gameworks, and ZeniMax Online Studios, for over in cash. According to Spencer, the ZeniMax acquisition was intended to give Microsoft a large library of games known around the world, and to expand the library of Xbox Game Pass and XCloud. However, during 2023 hearings regarding the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s concern over the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, Spencer said that Sony Interactive Entertainment had made sways at Bethesda to keep &quot;Starfield&quot; as a PlayStation-exclusive, further prompting Microsoft to purchase Zenimax. Both U.S. and European Union regulatory agencies approved the acquisition by early March 2021, and the acquisition was formally completed by March 9, 2021. The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion Bethesda Softworks, the primarily publisher for all of ZeniMax&#x27;s games, remained as an operational unit under Microsoft with the acquisition and retained all its current leadership. With the acquisition, future games from the studios will be exclusive to Xbox consoles, but existing commitments to other platforms (such as Arkane Studios&#x27; &quot;Deathloop&quot; and Tango Gameworks&#x27; &quot;&quot;, which are contractually exclusive to PlayStation 5 for a period of 12 months before their release on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S) will still be honored. Spencer stated that Game Pass was also fundamental driver for the acquisition. A preliminary injunction to block the acquisition had been sought in an ongoing class-action lawsuit that ZeniMax faced over &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, with the plaintiffs in the case arguing that Microsoft could shield ZeniMax&#x27;s assets from damages should they be found liable after the acquisition. The ZeniMax Board of Directors was dissolved following the Microsoft purchase.
On January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard in an all-cash deal valued at $68.7 billion. Microsoft stated that this acquisition would make it the third-largest gaming company by revenue, following Tencent and Sony. With the announcement, Microsoft also announced a major change to its corporate structure, with Phil Spencer becoming CEO of the new division Microsoft Gaming, with Matt Booty leading Xbox Game Studios under it. Once approved, Activision Blizzard would then become a subdivision of Microsoft Gaming. The deal was cleared by various national regulators by October 13, 2023, with Microsoft closing the deal the same day.

During litigation on the merger with the United States Federal Trade Commission, internal documents from Microsoft show strong interest in re-acquiring Bungie, or acquiring Sega&#x27;s game development companies, Supergiant Games, Niantic, Inc., Thunderful Group, Zynga, IO Interactive, Scopely, or Playrix as part of Xbox Game Studios, as well as publisher Square Enix to help bolster its Asian presence and mobile market share.

In January 2023, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees, which represented about 5% of its global workforce. Included in those layoffs were many employees from 343 Industries, The Coalition, and Bethesda Game Studios. On October 26, 2023, Microsoft announced the promotion of several employees in the company, including Sarah Bond being promoted to president of Xbox, overseeing all Xbox platform, business, and hardware work, and Matt Booty promoted from president of Xbox to president of Game Content and Studios, including the new responsibility of overseeing ZeniMax and Bethesda, with Jamie Leder still running Zenimax as a limited integration entity, but now reporting to Matt. In the wake of Matt Booty&#x27;s promotion, Alan Hartman, then the head of Turn 10, was subsequently promoted to head of Xbox Game Studios. On October 6, 2024, 343 Industries officially announced their rebranding as Halo Studios, additionally confirming that multiple &quot;Halo&quot; games were in development and that said projects would now use Unreal Engine 5 as opposed to the proprietary Slipspace Engine that powered &quot;Halo Infinite&quot;. On October 14, Rare creative lead Craig Duncan was announced to be succeeding Alan Hartman as head of Xbox Game Studios beginning in November 2024, with Hartman retiring after a three-decade tenure at Microsoft.

<doc id="456845" wikidata="Q3244266" url="?curid=456845" title="Tylos">
<text>Tylos () was the Greek exonym of ancient Bahrain in the classical era, during which the island was a center of maritime trade and pearling in the Erythraean Sea. The name &quot;Tylos&quot; is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic &quot;Tilmun&quot; (from Dilmun). From the 6th to 3rd century BC Bahrain was part of the Persian Empire. After the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great, his admiral Nearchus led an expedition which discovered the island, and serving under Nearchus was Androsthenes of Thasos, who left an extensive account of the island in &quot;Periplus of India,&quot; the source of many subsequent writers, including the contemporary botanist Theophrastus, who states that the island was a rich source of cotton and timber.

==History==
The Greek geographer Strabo mentions islands in Persian Gulf named Tyre and Arad (Muharraq) and the local legend that they are the metropoleis of Phoenicians. Herodotus also reports the Tyrian tradition that Phoenicians originated in the Persian Gulf, and theory that the same pair of cities Tyros/Tylos and Arad in both Phoenicia and Persian Gulf may suggest colonization from one way or another has been much discussed. However, there is little evidence of occupation at all in Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.

It is not known whether Bahrain was part of the Seleucid Empire, although the archaeological site at Qalat Al Bahrain has been proposed as a Seleucid base in the Persian Gulf. During this period, Tylos was very much part of the Hellenised world: while Aramaic was in everyday use, the language of the upper classes was Greek. Local coinage shows a seated Zeus, who may have been worshiped there as a syncretised form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Tylos also held Greek athletic contests.

With the waning of Seleucid power, Tylos passed under the control of Mesene, the kingdom founded in what today is Kuwait by Hyspaosines in 129 BC, which ruled the island until second century AD. A building inscription found in Bahrain indicates that Hyspoasines appointed a strategos to rule the islands. Another king of Mesene Meredates (r. 130–151 AD) from the Parthian dynasty is also mentioned by an inscription to have Tylos governed by a satrap.

In the third century AD, the Sassanids succeeded the Parthians as the suzerain of Mesene. Ardashir, the first ruler of the Sassanian dynasty conquered the area and give the kingdom to his son. Likewise, the son of Shapur I was crowned the king of Mesene. At some point Mesene ceased to be a sub-kingdom, and Bahrain was incorporated into the Sassanid province of Mazon covering the Persian Gulf&#x27;s southern shore.

By the fifth century Bahrain was a centre for Nestorian Christianity, with Samahij having an episcopal see. In 410, according to the Oriental Syriac Church synodal records, a bishop named Batai was excommunicated from the church in Bahrain. It was also the site of worship of a shark deity called Awal. Worshipers reputedly built a large statue to Awal in Muharraq, although it has now been lost, and for many centuries after Tylos, the islands of Bahrain were known as &quot;Awal&quot;.

<doc id="456862" wikidata="Q656920" url="?curid=456862" title="HMS Cornwall (F99)">
<text>HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot; was a Batch 3 Type 22 frigate of the Royal Navy. She was the first Batch 3 to be built, and the last to decommissioned. &quot;Cornwall&quot; was based at HMNB Devonport in Devon, England, part of the Devonport Flotilla.

She was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders and launched by Diana, Princess of Wales at Scotstoun on the River Clyde in October 1985 and commissioned at Falmouth in 1988 by the ship&#x27;s sponsor, Diana, Princess of Wales (who was also the Duchess of Cornwall).

==Service==
Originally lead ship (Captain F) of the Devonport-based 8th Frigate Squadron and upon its disbandment in 1993, lead ship of the 2nd Frigate Squadron, HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot; had battle honours from Barfleur in 1692, the Falkland Islands in 1914 and the Dardanelles in 1915.

&quot;Cornwall&quot; was affectionately dubbed &quot;the Fighting Ice Cream&quot; by her crew due to her pennant number of F99. She undertook duties in the North and South Atlantic Ocean, Adriatic, Mediterranean, Caribbean and Baltic Seas throughout her time in service, and completed several patrols to the Persian Gulf and deployments to the Far East.

During 1988 and 1989 she was commanded by Captain Chris Wreford-Brown.

In 1992 she deployed to the West Indies as West Indies Guard ship, visiting Bermuda, Tortola, Belize, The Bahamas, Pensacola, Key West and Curaçao before making her way home up the East Coast of the US and Canada via Norfolk, Boston and Halifax. In 1993 she deployed to the Gulf with a mid-deployment break to Mombasa in Kenya. 1994 saw her return again to the Gulf but this time visiting Singapore, Penang, Tioman Island and Sri Lanka whilst off station. En route back from the Far East, the ship took the opportunity to stop and lay a wreath at the site of the sinking of the previous , a County Class heavy cruiser sunk by Japanese dive bombers in April 1942.

Between 1996 and 1998 she was commanded by Captain Anthony Dymock.

In 1996 she served as flagship of the First Sea Lord in Saint Petersburg, during the 300th anniversary celebrations of the Russian Navy, followed by a period as flagship of NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force Atlantic. In 2001 she was part of the Royal Navy Task Force engaged in the invasion of Afghanistan. In 2003 she was again committed to Standing Naval Force Atlantic, supporting Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean

Following the death of the Princess of Wales in 1997, the role of sponsor was assumed by Mary Holborow, Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall.

Between 1999 and 2001 she was commanded by Captain Timothy McClement.

Ceremonial activities have included acting as flagship for the Battle of the Atlantic Fleet Review in 1993, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic, and in 2002 delivering a 21-gun salute as part of celebrations of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

On 28 January 2006 &quot;Cornwall&quot; was rededicated, following a period of docked maintenance, in a ceremony at Falmouth attended by Lady Mary Holborow.

On 23 March 2007, fifteen sailors and Royal Marines from HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot; were detained by elements of the Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution following a routine search of a vessel suspected of smuggling, in the vicinity of disputed territorial waters.

In February 2011, while operating in the Gulf of Aden as part of the Combined Maritime Forces, boarding teams from HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot; participated in the rescue of five Yemeni fishermen and the capture of 17 Somali pirates from a fishing dhow, which had been seized by pirates on 11 November 2010.
==Decommissioning and disposal==
On 26 April 2011 she returned to Plymouth for the last time, and decommissioned on 30 June 2011. Her decommissioning pennant was presented to the Davidstow Airfield and Cornwall at War Museum on 5 October 2011. The ship&#x27;s bell was presented to Truro Cathedral on 18 October 2011.

She was later towed to HMNB Portsmouth, where she lay with sister ships HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot;, HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, HMS &quot;Chatham&quot;. All four were put up for sale in January 2013 and in July sold to Swansea Drydocks for demolition. She left Portsmouth, being towed to Swansea, on 24 October 2013.

Should a future ship be named &quot;Cornwall&quot;, her ship&#x27;s company will be able to visit Truro to revive the Royal Navy&#x27;s links with the county and return the Bell to the county&#x27;s affiliated ship.

<text>The coppersmith barbet (Psilopogon haemacephalus), also called crimson-breasted barbet and coppersmith, is an Asian barbet with crimson forehead and throat, known for its metronomic call that sounds similar to a coppersmith striking metal with a hammer. It is a resident bird in the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. It carves out holes inside a tree to build its nest. It is predominantly frugivorous, but has been observed eating insects, especially winged termites.

==Description==
The coppersmith barbet is green with a red head, yellow cheeks and a yellow throat. Its underparts are streaked in grey and black.
During the nesting season, the wear and tear on the feathers can cause the plumage of the upper back to appear bluish.
It is long and weighs .

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Bucco haemacephalus&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776 for a barbet from the Philippines.
&quot;Bucco indicus&quot; was proposed by John Latham in 1790 for a streaked barbet from India with a black head and red forehead.
&quot;Bucco roseus&quot; was proposed by Charles Dumont de Sainte-Croix in 1816.
Asian barbets were placed in the genus &quot;Megalaima&quot; proposed by George Robert Gray in 1842 who suggested to use this name instead of &quot;Bucco&quot;.
&quot;Xantholaema intermedia&quot; proposed by George Ernest Shelley in 1891 were barbets from Negros and Cebu islands in the collection of the British Museum.
&quot;Megalaima haemacephala delica&quot; proposed by Carl Parrot in 1910 were four barbets from Deli and Sumatra in the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology.
&quot;Megalaima haemacephala mindanensis&quot; proposed by Austin L. Rand in 1948 was a coppersmith barbet from Mount Apo in Mindanao.
&quot;Megalaema haemacephala celestinoi&quot; proposed by Ernest Thomas Gilliard in 1949 was a coppersmith barbet from Samar island of the Philippines.
&quot;Megalaema haemacephala cebuensis&quot; and &quot;Megalaema haemacephala homochroa&quot; proposed by Victoria Dziadosz and Kenneth Parkes in 1984 were coppersmith barbets from Toledo, Cebu and Tablas Island, respectively.

Molecular phylogenetic research of barbets revealed that &quot;Megalaima&quot; species form a clade, which also includes the fire-tufted barbet, the only species placed in the genus &quot;Psilopogon&quot; at the time. Asian barbets were therefore reclassified under &quot;Psilopogon&quot;, which is the older scientific name. The coppersmith barbet is one of the oldest Asian barbets in terms of genetic divergence and speciation.
Nine coppersmith barbet subspecies are recognized as of 2014:
* the nominate subspecies &quot;P. h. haemacephalus&quot; occurs in Luzon and Mindoro
* &quot;P. h. indicus&quot; ranges from northeastern Pakistan to Sri Lanka, China, Vietnam and Singapore
* &quot;P. h. roseus&quot; occurs in Java and Bali
* &quot;P. h. intermedia&quot; occurs in Panay, Guimaras and Negros
* &quot;P. h. delicus&quot; occurs in Sumatra
* &quot;P. h. mindanensis&quot; occurs in Mindanao
* &quot;P. h. celestinoi&quot; occurs in Samar, Catanduanes, Biliran, and Leyte
* &quot;P. h. cebuensis&quot; occurs in Cebu
* &quot;P. h. homochroa&quot; occurs in Tablas Island

== Distribution and habitat ==

Throughout its range, it inhabits gardens, groves and sparse woodland. Habitats with dead wood suitable for excavation of nests are important.

In the Palni Hills it occurs below . In northern India, it occurs in the valleys of the outer Himalayas up to . It is rare in northwestern Indian states and in wet forests in Assam.

The coppersmith barbet&#x27;s range overlaps with several larger barbets in most of South Asia. In the Western Ghats, its range partly overlaps with the Malabar barbet.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The coppersmith barbet lives solitary or in small groups; larger parties have occasionally been sighted in abundantly fruiting Ficus trees. It appears to be fond of sunning in the morning on bare top branches of tall trees, often flitting about to sit next to each other. Its flight is straight, with rapid flaps.

It competes with other cavity nesting birds and frugivores. Blue-throated barbets have been seen evicting coppersmith barbets from their nest holes, while red-vented bulbuls have been seen to indulge in kleptoparasitism, robbing the male of berries brought to the female at the nest.

The nest holes are also used for roosting and some birds roost alone in cavities and these often roost during part of the day. Immatures will roost with the parents but often return to roost early so as not to be prevented by the parents from entering the roost cavity.
===Vocalisation===
The call is a loud rather metallic &quot;tuk…tuk…tuk&quot; (or &quot;tunk&quot;), reminiscent of a copper sheet being beaten, giving the bird its name. Repeated monotonously for long periods, starting with a subdued &quot;tuk&quot; and building up to an even volume and tempo, the latter varying from 108 to 121 per minute and can continue with as many as 204 notes. They are silent and do not call in winter.

The beak remains shut during each call - a patch of bare skin on both sides of the throat inflates and collapses with each &quot;tuk&quot; like a rubber bulb and the head is bobbed.

===Diet===
The coppersmith barbet prefers banyan, peepul, and other wild figs, various drupes and berries, and the occasional insect, caught in aerial sallies. It also feeds on flower petals. It eats nearly 1.5 to nearly 3 times its own body weight in berries each day.

===Breeding===
Courtship involves singing, puffing of the throat, bobbing of the head, flicking of the tail, ritual feeding and allopreening. Birds nest and roost in cavities.

It breeds through much of the year with local variation. The breeding season is mainly February to April in India and December to September in Sri Lanka. Both sexes excavate the nest on the underside of a narrow horizontal branch. They also roost inside the nest holes. The female lays three or four eggs. Both sexes incubate. The Incubation period is not well known, but has been estimated to be about two weeks. Often two broods are raised in quick succession.

===Mortality factors===
Adult birds are sometimes taken by predatory species. In urban areas, there are records of collisions with structures including white walls. Pesticide poisoning has also been noted.

<text>Charles Inglis (1734 – 24 February 1816) was an Irish Anglican clergyman and ardent Tory who was consecrated the first Anglican bishop in North America for the Diocese of Nova Scotia. He died at Kingston, Nova Scotia. He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Church (Halifax).

== Early and family life ==

He was born in 1734, the youngest of three sons of the Reverend Archibald Inglis, the rector of Glencolmcille and Kilcar, a remote parish in southwest County Donegal, on the west coast of the Irish province of Ulster. He was subsequently orphaned at the age of 11. He married Mary Vining in 1764, connecting him to one of the most powerful families in Delaware. She died in childbirth shortly afterwards. He married for the second time on May 31, 1773, Margaret Crooke (d. 1783); they had two sons and two daughters. His son, John ( – 1850), became the third bishop of Nova Scotia in 1825.

==Ministry and involvement in the American Revolution==
Inglis became rector of Killybegs, Donegal, but in 1755 he sailed to America and worked as a teacher under the auspices of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. In 1758 the Bishop of London ordained him as a priest. Rev. Inglis spent several years in Delaware before moving to Trinity Church in New York in 1765, where his oldest child Charles is buried.

In 1776, in response to Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense&quot;, Inglis wrote a treatise, &quot;The True Interest of America Impartially Stated&quot;.
Following the British occupation of New York in 1777, Inglis was promoted from curate to rector of Trinity Church. As a Loyalist, it is recorded that Inglis prayed aloud for King George III while George Washington was in the congregation. The church was quickly surrounded by militia. Inglis&#x27; home was plundered. In November 1783, upon the evacuation of Loyalists from New York, Inglis returned to England. However, his whole congregation 
of Trinity Church went to Nova Scotia. The new rector (1784) of Trinity Church was Samuel Provoost, the first Episcopal Bishop of New York (1787).

On 11 August 1787, George III created the Diocese of Nova Scotia by Letters Patent, and named Inglis its first bishop. He preached at St. Paul&#x27;s Church (Halifax). The independence of the thirteen colonies which would form the United States had led to the creation of a new, autonomous, Anglican church there, with Samuel Seabury as the first bishop, but Inglis was the first Church of England bishop in North America, though technically his Episcopal see was &quot;the Province of Nova Scotia&quot;. 

Eager to increase the status of Anglicanism in the colonies, Inglis, supported the 1789 foundation of King&#x27;s College (now the University of King&#x27;s College, founded as &quot;moral&quot; successor of King&#x27;s college of New York, later Columbia University) in Windsor, Nova Scotia, as an exclusive academy for sons of the Anglican elite. In 1783, when the outcome of the American Revolution was obvious, Inglis, along with other British elites, wrote to the government in Nova Scotia to petition for the establishment of a college,The founding of a College or Seminary of learning on a liberal plan in that province where youth may receive a virtuous education and can be qualified for the learned professions, is a measure of the greatest consequence, as it would diffuse religious literature, loyalty and good morals among His Majesty’s subjects there. If such a seminary is not established the inhabitants will have no means of educating their sons at home, but will be under the necessity of sending them to Great Britain or Ireland, which will be attended with an expense that few can bear, or else to some of the states of this continent, where they will soon imbibe principles that are unfavourable to the British tradition.He also backed several missionary efforts to turn the majority of the population from their dissenting religious beliefs. These efforts were largely unsuccessful.

==Death and legacy==

Bishop Inglis died on 24 February 1816 at Kingston, Nova Scotia. He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Church (Halifax). 

There is a silver plaque in honour of Charles Inglis St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. He became a Doctor of Divinity.

<text>Illinois Wesleyan University is a private liberal arts college in Bloomington, Illinois. Founded in 1850, the central portion of the present campus was acquired in 1854 with the first building erected in 1856.

== History ==
The institution was founded in 1850 as a private four-year college in Bloomington, Illinois.

The university&#x27;s first international students, Y. Osawa and K. Tanaka, arrived from Japan in 1889.

Illinois Wesleyan&#x27;s College of Liberal Arts was formally organized in 1906, and the College of Fine Arts – combining schools of art, music, and theatre arts – was established in 1948.

Illinois Wesleyan offered nursing study in conjunction with the Brokaw School of Nursing beginning in 1923, and in 1959 established the IWU School of Nursing with a four-year baccalaureate program.

IWU operated a School of Law from 1873 to 1928.

The institution&#x27;s board of trustees took formal action to invite black students to enroll at Illinois Wesleyan in 1867 and women in 1870. The first female graduate, Hannah I. Shur, received her diploma in 1872. Gus A. Hill was the first African-American graduate, earning a law degree in 1880.

In November 2021, the American Association of University Professors sanctioned Illinois Wesleyan for violating standards of academic governance when it discontinued the anthropology, French, Italian, and religious studies programs and announced plans to fire six tenured faculty members.

== Academics ==
Illinois Wesleyan is an independent, residential university with an approximate enrollment of 1,527. It offers over 42 majors, minors and programs. Its most popular majors, based on number out of 381 graduates in 2022, were:
*Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse (53)
*Business/Commerce (36)
*Psychology (31)
*Finance (28)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (26)

The university maintains a student/faculty ratio of 11 to 1, with an average class size of 16 More than 9 in 10 IWU students receive a scholarship or need-based assistance. Illinois Wesleyan is also a member of the Annapolis Group and has chapters in the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi honor societies.

The university consists of the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Fine Arts that includes three professional schools—the Ames School of Art, School of Music and the School of Theatre Arts; and the School of Nursing. Illinois Wesleyan&#x27;s campus occupies approximately a short walk north from downtown Bloomington in central Illinois.

Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs are offered in three colleges:
*College of Liberal Arts: organized in 1906
*College of Fine Arts: Schools of art, music, and theatre arts organized in 1929, 1946, 1947 respectively
*School of Nursing: Established in 1959

===Ames Library===

Illinois Wesleyan&#x27;s Ames Library was completed in 2002. It contains over 368,000 volumes spread over five floors. The Ames Library also houses eight sets of stained glass panels originally from Pembroke College at Oxford University. Among the special collections are the papers of former U.S. Representative Leslie C. Arends; the Gernon collection of first editions of detective fiction and mysteries; and the Schultz collection of 18th- and 19th-century British drama, including &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. Construction cost $25.7 million; Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbot were the principal architects.

===May Term===
Illinois Wesleyan offers a May Term course option. The university refers to it as a 4–4–1 system. This allows any student who has completed a full course-load in either the spring or fall semesters of that academic year to enroll in a May Term class.

May Term classes last approximately three weeks during the month of May. Students take several hours of instruction in the same course each day for five days each week. This allows the students to immerse themselves in that one topic. At the end of the May Term a student completes the equivalent of a single course during one semester.

May Term emphasizes curricular experimentation, and also offers an opportunity for service projects, study abroad, and internships.

===Study abroad===
Illinois Wesleyan offers a number of study abroad opportunities, and ranks in the top 40 schools in the nation for students studying abroad. IWU&#x27;s International Office provides support for over 300 global Study Abroad Options in 70 countries through various institutes such as IES and SIT Study Abroad. Domestically, IWU offers a UN semester, a Washington Semester, and the Associated Colleges of the Midwest Chicago Program. Internationally it offers programs in London and Barcelona. It also maintains a very strong relationship with Pembroke College, Oxford, and traditionally a few juniors can spend a year there as exchange students.

===Research===
The university publishes several different undergraduate research journals in the fields of political science, economics, history, and English. Perhaps the first of its kind, the &quot;Undergraduate Economic Review&quot; is a student-managed, open access journal that has published original undergraduate content from students in the U.S. and at least 15 other countries. Its &quot;internal twin&quot;, the &quot;Park Place Economist&quot;, publishes original work of Economics seniors graduating Illinois Wesleyan University. Articles range from basic topical explorations to focused senior research. All published volumes are available online.

The John Wesley Powell Student Research Conference was established in 1990 to provide opportunities for students to present research projects and findings in a public and interactive manner. The Action Research Center was established in 2004 to partner student research and service projects with the wider Illinois community.

== Athletics ==

Illinois Wesleyan University participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III and is a member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW). Illinois Wesleyan teams have won 136 CCIW Titles and 9 Division III National Championships. Illinois Wesleyan has produced 135 Academic All-American student athletes since the program began in 1970, a total that is tied for 25th among all participating colleges and universities, regardless of NCAA division.

Illinois Wesleyan University&#x27;s Division III athletic teams, known as the &quot;Titans,&quot; helped found the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) in 1946. Illinois Wesleyan was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1910 to 1937.

The Titans have 22 varsity teams, 11 men&#x27;s and 11 women&#x27;s, with the addition of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

===Shirk Center===

Shirk Center is the university&#x27;s athletic complex. The two-story complex was constructed in 1994. A 20,000-square-foot expansion was opened in 2016. The Shirk complex provides a multi-use facility for squash, tennis, basketball, and other indoor sports. It also houses Fort Natorium, the university&#x27;s swimming center, as well as classrooms and a six-lane, 200-meter track. The Shirk Center also hosted the 2010 &amp; 2011 NCAA Division III Women&#x27;s National Basketball Championships. The &quot;Shirk&quot; is also the championship venue for the annual State Farm Holiday Classic, one of the largest, coed high school holiday basketball tournaments in the nation, as well as the Heart of Illinois Conference basketball tournament in mid-January.

==Campus life==
The university and Student Senate regularly bring speakers and comedians to campus. There are regularly organized social events both on and off-campus. Faculty colloquia regularly provide opportunities for intellectual discussion and encouragement. The campus itself is an arboretum, home to over 1,000 trees from 90 different species.

===Residential living and community===
All halls are co-ed, all residence hall rooms have cable television and wireless Internet, and the vast majority of rooms are two/three-person units. Dodds Hall offers eight-person suites and Harriet Fuller Rust House offers four-person and six-person suites as well as two eight-person two-story townhouse style suites. Traditional style living is offered in Magill Hall and Pfeiffer Hall. First-year students live in first-year halls: Gulick Hall, Munsell Hall, and Ferguson Hall. Illinois Wesleyan also offers two themed housing communities: Kemp Hall (the International House) and Blackstock Hall (the Arts House). Nearly one-third of the campus community is involved and/or resides in one of five fraternities or four sororities. Students are also able to live in the Gates (est. 2013), and the East Street Apartments (est. 2006) which are modern, apartment-style residences that students can sign as leases.

===Campus activities and organizations===
There are 200 student organizations at Wesleyan, ranging from the rock-climbing club, the Anime club, to Pi Kappa Lambda (the music honors society). The national fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon was founded on campus in 1899.

===Lectures and speakers===
Illinois Wesleyan co-hosts the annual Stevenson Lecture Series, initiated in 1965 as a memorial to former Governor Adlai Stevenson. IWU co-hosts the Lecture Series with Illinois State University.

Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the university twice, in 1961 and 1966. In 1966 he came to the university while he was trying to organize in Chicago. There, he said,
And I still have faith in America because I love America and I believe that we will continue to build a coalition of conscience that one day will solve this problem. We sing a little song in our movement and it has been our guiding faith. Sometimes we’ve been facing hooded perpetrators of violence; sometimes we face jeering mobs. Sometimes we face dogs and the gushing waters from fire hoses. Sometimes in crowded jail cells we join hands to sing it. And sometimes in just open mass meetings. But we could sing it as a hymn of faith. We shall overcome, we shall overcome, deep in my heart I do believe we shall overcome.

===Media===
Illinois Wesleyan has its own radio station, WESN 88.1 FM. It plays a mix of indie, rock, classic, electronic, and folk music.

Wesleyan also has its own television station, Titan TV, broadcasting exclusively to IWU&#x27;s residence halls. It broadcasts a collection of movies and campus announcements.

The campus newspaper is called &quot;The Argus&quot;, published continuously under student supervision since 1894.

===Transportation===
Illinois Wesleyan University is served by Connect Transit. The Blue, Gold, and Green routes provide bus service between campus, downtown Bloomington, uptown Normal, and other destinations.

==Sustainability==
IWU&#x27;s Minor Myers Jr. Welcome Center, opened in 2008, and State Farm Hall, opened in 2013, include geothermal heating/cooling systems. The Welcome Center was awarded Silver Certification as a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) building.

The university&#x27;s &quot;Think Green&quot; behavioral change campaign encourages community members to conserve resources.

<doc id="456920" wikidata="Q5326321" url="?curid=456920" title="Earl of Macclesfield">
<text>Earl of Macclesfield is a title that has been created twice. The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1679 in favour of the soldier and politician Charles Gerard, 1st Baron Gerard. He had already been created Baron Gerard, of Brandon in the County of Suffolk, in 1645, and was made Viscount Brandon, of Brandon in the County of Suffolk, at the same time as he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of England. Lord Macclesfield was the great-grandson of the distinguished judge Sir Gilbert Gerard, Master of the Rolls from 1581 to 1594. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was involved in the Rye House Plot of 1683, was sentenced to death but later pardoned by the King. On his death without legitimate issue in 1701 the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Earl. He had earlier represented Yarmouth, Lancaster and Lancashire in the House of Commons. When he died in 1702 the titles became extinct.

William Dorington or Dorrington, Colonel of the King&#x27;s Royal Irish Regiment of Foot Guards, was created Earl of Macclesfield in the Jacobite Peerage in or about 1716. The title, such as it was, became extinct in 1841.

The second creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1721 when the noted lawyer Thomas Parker, 1st Baron Parker, was made Viscount Parker, of Ewelm in the County of Oxford, and Earl of Macclesfield, in the County Palatine of Chester. He was Lord Chief Justice of the Queen&#x27;s Bench from 1710 to 1718 and Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1718 to 1725. Parker had already been created Lord Parker, Baron of Macclesfield, in the County Palatine of Chester, in 1716. This title is also in the Peerage of Great Britain. In contrast to the barony the viscountcy and earldom were created with remainder, in default of male issue, to his daughter Elizabeth, wife of Sir William Heathcote, 1st Baronet of Hursley Park, and her issue male. In 1725 Lord Macclesfield was convicted of corruption and forced to pay a £30,000 fine. He was succeeded by his son George, the second Earl, who was a distinguished astronomer and served as president of the Royal Society for many years.

On George&#x27;s death the titles passed to his son Thomas, the third Earl. He had sat as Member of Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme, Oxfordshire and Rochester. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was a prominent politician and served as President of the Board of Agriculture from 1816 to 1818. When he died the titles passed to his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He had represented Oxfordshire in the House of Commons as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his grandson, the seventh Earl. He was the son of George Augustus Parker, Viscount Parker, eldest son of the sixth Earl. Lord Macclesfield was Lord-Lieutenant of Oxfordshire from 1954 to 1963. the titles are held by his grandson, the ninth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1992.

Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, first husband of the Queen, is the son of Derek Henry Parker-Bowles (who assumed his mother&#x27;s maiden surname of Bowles), grandson of Reverend the Hon. Algernon Robert Parker, third son of the sixth Earl. Consequently, he is in distant remainder to the earldom and its subsidiary titles. Another member of the family was the Right Reverend Wilfrid Parker (1883–1966), son of the Hon. Cecil Thomas Parker, second son of the sixth Earl. He served as Bishop of Pretoria (1933–1950).

The family seat of the Parker family is Shirburn Castle, near Oxford, but the castle and estate is held by the Beechwood Estates Company, the Macclesfield family estate management company. Following a long-running and acrimonious court battle, the ninth Earl was evicted from the family seat at the end of 2004.

<text>The brown-headed barbet (Psilopogon zeylanicus) is an Asian barbet species native to the Indian subcontinent, where it inhabits tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests.

==Taxonomy==
The brown-headed barbet was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the puffbirds in the genus &quot;Bucco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Bucco zeylanicus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;yellow cheeked barbet&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1776 by the naturalist Peter Brown from a specimen collected in Sri Lanka. The brown-headed barbet is now one of 32 barbets placed in the genus &quot;Psilopogon&quot; that was introduced in 1836 by Salomon Müller.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. z. inornatus&quot; (Walden, 1870) – west India
* &quot;P. z. caniceps&quot; (Franklin, 1831) – Nepal to central India
* &quot;P. z. zeylanicus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – south India and Sri Lanka

==Description==
The adult has a streaked brown head, neck and breast, and a yellow eye patch. The rest of the plumage is green. It is long with a large head, short neck and short tail.

Its call is a repetitive &quot;kutroo…kutroo…kutroo&quot;, but silent in the winter. Others take up the call when one starts.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is widespread, with its range stretching from the Terai in southern Nepal in the north to Sri Lanka in the south, encompassing most of peninsular India, and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. 

==Behaviour and ecology==
It is an arboreal species of gardens and wooded country which eats fruit and insects. It is fairly tolerant of humans and often seen in city parks. It nests in a tree hole, laying 2-4 eggs. It forages on mangoes, ripe jackfruit, papaya, banana, figs and similar cultivated fruit trees. Its habitat includes urban and country gardens; it tends to eschew heavy forest. It nests in a suitable hole in a tree that it will often excavate. Both sexes incubate the eggs and often communicate with each other using their &quot;Kura, kura&quot; calls.

<text>Earl Waldegrave is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1729 for James Waldegrave, 2nd Baron Waldegrave.

==History==
The Waldegrave family descends from Sir Richard Waldegrave, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1381 to 1382. His son and namesake, Sir Richard Waldegrave, was a soldier and fought in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. His descendant Sir Edward Waldegrave was a politician and courtier. A prominent Catholic, he held office under Queen Mary I, who granted him the Chewton estate in Somerset. However, Waldegrave was imprisoned in the Tower of London after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, where he died in 1561. His grandson Edward Waldegrave fought as a Royalist in the Civil War despite his old age. In 1643 he was created a baronet, of Hever Castle in the County of Kent, in the Baronetage of England.

Henry Waldegrave, the fourth Baronet and Richard&#x27;s great-grandson (the title having descended from father to son), married Henrietta FitzJames, illegitimate daughter of King James II and his mistress Arabella Churchill. Mainly thanks to this marriage Waldegrave was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Waldegrave, of Chewton in the County of Somerset. He was succeeded by his son James Waldegrave, the second Baron. He served as Ambassador to the Holy Roman Empire and to France. In 1729 he was honoured when he was created Viscount Chewton, of Chewton in the County of Somerset, and Earl Waldegrave in the Peerage of Great Britain. On his death the titles passed to his son, the second Earl. He was invited to form a government by the King in 1757, but was unsuccessful (and is normally not considered to have held the post of Prime Minister). Lord Waldegrave married Maria Walpole, illegitimate daughter of Edward Walpole, son of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole. He died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He was a general in the Army and also held political office. When he died the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He fought in the American Revolutionary War and also represented Newcastle-under-Lyme in the House of Commons of Great Britain.

His eldest son, the fifth Earl, died from drowning at the age of nine. The young Earl was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. He was a soldier and commanded the 54th Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Waterloo. He was succeeded by his eldest legitimate son, the seventh Earl. He died childless at an early age and was succeeded by his uncle, the eighth Earl. He was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and also sat as Member of Parliament for Bedford. His eldest son William Frederick Waldegrave, Viscount Chewton, died in 1854 from wounds received at the Battle of Alma during the Crimean War. Lord Waldegrave was therefore succeeded by his grandson, the ninth Earl (the eldest son of Viscount Chewton). He was a Conservative politician and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1896 to 1905. He was succeeded by his only son, the tenth Earl. He never married and on his death in 1933 the titles passed to his uncle, the eleventh Earl. He was the second son of the aforementioned Viscount Chewton. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the twelfth Earl. He sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served as Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1957 to 1962. Lord Waldegrave also held the honorary post of Lord Warden of the Stannaries from 1965 to 1976. the titles are held by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1995.

Three other members of the Waldegrave family have also gained distinction. William Waldegrave, second son of the third Earl, was a prominent naval commander and was created Baron Radstock in 1800 (see this title for further information on this branch of the family). Samuel Waldegrave, second son of the eighth Earl, was a clergyman and served as Bishop of Carlisle from 1860 to 1869. William Waldegrave, second son of the twelfth Earl, is a Conservative politician and was created a life peer as Baron Waldegrave of North Hill in 1999.

The family seat is Chewton House, near Chewton Mendip, Somerset. As suggested by the territorial designation of the baronetcy, the family once owned Hever Castle. The family&#x27;s coat of arms is one of the easiest to describe: &quot;Per pale argent and gules&quot;. Its supporters are two talbots, sable, eared or, gorged with a coronet argent. The crest is a set of five plumes.

<doc id="456930" wikidata="Q4161795" url="?curid=456930" title="Dynamic braking">
<text>Dynamic braking is the use of an electric traction motor as a generator when slowing a vehicle such as an electric or diesel-electric locomotive. It is termed &quot;rheostatic&quot; if the generated electrical power is dissipated as heat in brake grid resistors, and &quot;regenerative&quot; if the power is returned to the supply line. Dynamic braking reduces wear on friction-based braking components, and regeneration lowers net energy consumption. Dynamic braking may also be used on railcars with multiple units, light rail vehicles, electric trams, trolleybuses, and electric and hybrid electric automobiles.

==Principle of operation==
Converting electrical energy to the mechanical energy of a rotating shaft (electric motor) is the inverse of converting the mechanical energy of a rotating shaft to electrical energy (electric generator). Both are accomplished through the interactions of armature windings with a (relatively) moving external magnetic field, with the armature connected to an electrical circuit with either a power supply (motor) or power receptor (generator). Since the role of the electrical/mechanical energy converting device is determined by which interface (mechanical or electrical) provides or receives energy, the same device can fulfill the role of either a motor or a generator. In dynamic braking, the traction motor is switched into the role of a generator by switching from a supply circuit to a receptor circuit while applying electric current to the field coils that generate the magnetic field (excitation).

The amount of resistance applied to the rotating shaft (braking power) equals the rate of electrical power generation plus some efficiency loss. That is in turn proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, controlled by the current in the field coils, and the rate at which the armature and magnetic field rotate against each other, determined by the rotation of the wheels and the ratio of power shaft to wheel rotation. The amount of braking power is controlled by varying the strength of the magnetic field through the amount of current in the field coils. As the rate of electrical power generation, and conversely braking power, are proportional to the rate at which the power shaft is spinning, a stronger magnetic field is required to maintain braking power as speed decreases and there is a lower limit at which dynamic braking can be effective depending on the current available for application to the field coils.

The two main methods of managing the electricity generated during dynamic braking are rheostatic braking and regenerative braking, as described below.

For permanent magnet motors, dynamic braking is easily achieved by shorting the motor terminals, thus bringing the motor to a fast abrupt stop. This method, however, dissipates all the energy as heat in the motor itself, and so cannot be used in anything other than low-power intermittent applications due to cooling limitations, such as in cordless power tools. It is not suitable for traction applications.

==Rheostatic braking==
The electrical energy produced by the motors is dissipated as heat by a bank of onboard resistors, referred to as the &quot;braking grid&quot;. Large cooling fans are necessary to protect the resistors from damage. Modern systems have thermal monitoring, so that if the temperature of the bank becomes excessive it will be switched off, and the braking will revert to being by friction only.
==Regenerative braking==

In electrified systems the process of regenerative braking is employed whereby the current produced during braking is fed back into the power supply system for use by other traction units, instead of being wasted as heat. It is normal practice to incorporate both regenerative and rheostatic braking in electrified systems. If the power supply system is not &quot;receptive&quot;, i.e. incapable of absorbing the current, the system will default to rheostatic mode in order to provide the braking effect.

Yard locomotives with onboard energy storage systems which allow the recovery of some of the energy which would otherwise be wasted as heat are now available. The Green Goat model, for example, is being used by Canadian Pacific Railway, BNSF Railway, Kansas City Southern Railway and Union Pacific Railroad.

On modern passenger locomotives equipped with AC inverters pulling trains with sufficient head-end power (HEP) loads, braking energy can be used to power the train&#x27;s on board systems via regenerative braking if the electrification system is not receptive or even if the track is not electrified to begin with. The HEP load on modern passenger trains is so great that some new electric locomotives such as the ALP-46 were designed without the traditional resistance grids.

==Blended braking==
Dynamic braking alone is not enough to stop a locomotive, because its braking effect rapidly diminishes below about . Therefore, it is always used in conjunction with another form of braking, such as an air brake. The use of both braking systems at the same time is called blended braking. Li-ion batteries have also been used to store energy for use in bringing trains to a complete halt.

Although blended braking combines both dynamic and air braking, the resulting braking force is designed to be the same as the air brakes on their own provide. This is achieved by maximizing the dynamic brake portion, and automatically regulating the air brake portion, because the main purpose of dynamic braking is to reduce the amount of air braking required. That conserves air and minimizes the risks of over-heated wheels. One locomotive manufacturer, Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD), estimates that dynamic braking provides between 50% and 70% of the braking force during blended braking.

== Plug braking ==
A third method of electric braking is plug braking or &#x27;plugging&#x27;, under which a reverse torque is applied for a short time. It is the most rapid form of electric braking, but comes at the disadvantage of applying significant transient stresses to motors and mechanical components. It is typically abrupt and &#x27;jerky&#x27;, the braking equivalent of a &#x27;jog&#x27; in forward motion, and plug braking is never applied in electric traction applications. Nonetheless, it has been applied widely to applications such as long-travel and cross-travel drives of direct current and alternating-current powered overhead traveling cranes; hoist drives on such cranes typically use rheostatic braking. Reversing drives with (intentional) plug braking typically use rheostatic control for acceleration, and always have resistance in the motor circuit, when plug braking is applied, to limit the reverse (braking) torque. Plugging is usually achieved by moving the controller, briefly, to the first step of the opposite direction, and then back to the off position. After zero speed is reached, plugging must cease to avoid the drive running in reverse, and this function may be provided automatically, by a &#x27;plugging relay&#x27;. Plugging does not fit well with inverter-controlled drives; it is becoming less common, and it is actively discouraged in modern crane operation.

==Self-load test==
It is possible to use the brake grids as a form of dynamometer or load bank to perform a self-load test of the power output of a locomotive. With the locomotive stationary, the main generator (MG) output is connected to the grids instead of the traction motors. The grids are normally large enough to absorb the full engine power output, which is calculated from MG voltage and current output.

==Hydrodynamic braking==
Diesel locomotives with hydraulic transmission may be equipped for hydrodynamic braking. In this case, the torque converter or fluid coupling acts as a retarder in the same way as a water brake. Braking energy heats the hydraulic fluid, and the heat is dissipated (via a heat exchanger) by the engine cooling radiator. The engine will be idling (and producing little heat) during braking, so the radiator is not overloaded.

<text>Earl of Harrington is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was created in 1742.

==History==
The earldom of Harrington was granted in 1742 to William Stanhope, 1st Baron Harrington, the former Secretary of State and then Lord President of the Council. He was made Viscount Petersham at the same time. In 1730, he had been created Baron Harrington, of Harrington in the County of Northampton. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Harrington was the son of John Stanhope of Elvaston and the great-grandson of Sir John Stanhope of Elvaston, younger half-brother of Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield (who was the grandfather of James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope).

Lord Harrington was succeeded by his son William, the second Earl. He was a General in the Army and also represented Bury St Edmunds in the House of Commons. His son, the third Earl, was also a General in the Army and sat as Member of Parliament for Thetford and Westminster. His elder son, the fourth Earl, and younger son, the fifth Earl, were both Colonels in the Army.

The line of the fifth Earl failed in 1866 upon the early death of his son, the sixth Earl. The latter was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the son of the Very Reverend and Hon. FitzRoy Henry Richard, fourth son of the third Earl. His elder son, the eighth Earl, was a successful polo player. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the ninth Earl. His grandson, the eleventh Earl, succeeded his father in 1929.

In 1967, the eleventh Earl also succeeded as eighth Viscount Stanhope (of Mahon) and eighth Baron Stanhope (of Elvaston) upon the death of his distant relative James Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope, by a special remainder in these titles&#x27; patent that allowed them to be inherited by the male heirs of the aforementioned John Stanhope, father of the first Earl of Harrington. , the titles are held by the eleventh Earl&#x27;s son, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded his father in 2009.

The former family seat was Elvaston Castle, in Derbyshire. The house and grounds are currently owned by Derbyshire County Council, which has opened the gardens as a country park. The 5th Earl had a London townhouse built on land formerly belonging to Kensington Palace – Harrington House remained in the family until the First World War. It is currently home to the Russian Embassy.

Serena Armstrong-Jones, Countess of Snowdon, wife of the 2nd Earl of Snowdon, nephew of Queen Elizabeth II and a member of the extended British royal family, is the daughter of the 12th Earl of Harrington.

<doc id="456936" wikidata="Q202385" url="?curid=456936" title="Arnold Wesker">
<text>Sir Arnold Wesker (24 May 1932 – 12 April 2016) was an English dramatist. He was the author of 50 plays, four volumes of short stories, two volumes of essays, much journalism and a book on the subject, a children&#x27;s book, some poetry, and other assorted writings. His plays have been translated into 20 languages, and performed worldwide.

==Early life==
Wesker was born in Stepney, London, in 1932, the son of Leah (née Cecile Leah Perlmutter), a cook, and Joseph Wesker, a tailor&#x27;s machinist and active communist.

Arnold Wesker was delivered by Samuel Sacks, father of neurologist Oliver Sacks.

He attended a Jewish Infants School in Whitechapel. His education was then fragmented during World War II. He was briefly evacuated to Ely, Cambridgeshire, before returning to London where he attended Dean Street School during the Blitz. He then returned to live with his parents who had moved to a council flat in Hackney, East London, where he attended Northwold Road School. He then attended Upton House Central School, Hackney, from 1943. This was a school where emphasis was placed on teaching office skills, including typing, to bright boys who however had not been selected for grammar school places. He was then evacuated again to Llantrisant, South Wales.

He was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but could not afford to take up his place there. Later, he served for two years in the Royal Air Force, and then went on to work as cook, furniture maker, and bookseller.

After saving up enough money, he went to study at the London School of Film Technique, now known as the London Film School

==Career==
His inspiration for the 1957 play &quot;The Kitchen&quot;, which was later made into a film, came when he was working at the Bell Hotel in Norwich. It was while working here that he met his future wife Dusty.

Wesker&#x27;s plays have dealt with themes including self-discovery, love, confronting death and political disillusion. &quot;Chicken Soup with Barley&quot; (1958) went out to the regions. Rather than opening in the West End, its premiere was seen at the Coventry Theatre, a locale which typified Wesker&#x27;s political views as an &#x27;angry young man&#x27;.

Wesker&#x27;s play &quot;Roots&quot; (1959) was a kitchen sink drama about a girl, Beatie Bryant, who returns after three years of stay in London to her farming family home in Norfolk and struggles to voice herself. Critics commended the &quot;emotional authenticity&quot; brought out in the play. &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;The Kitchen&quot;, and &quot;Their Very Own and Golden City&quot; were staged by the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre under the management of George Devine and later William Gaskill.
Wesker&#x27;s 1962 play &quot;Chips With Everything&quot; shows class attitudes at the time by examining the life of an Army corporal.

===Nuclear disarmament===
Wesker joined with enthusiasm the Royal Court group on the Aldermaston March in 1959. Another of the Royal Court contingent, Lindsay Anderson, made a short documentary film (&quot;March to Aldermaston&quot;) about the event. He was an active member of the Committee of 100 and, with other prominent members, was jailed in 1961 for his part in its campaign of mass nonviolent resistance to nuclear weapons.

===Centre 42===
After his stay in prison in 1961, Wesker made a full-time commitment to become the leader of an initiative that had arisen from Resolution 42 of the 1960 Trades Union Congress, concerning the importance of arts in the community. 

The Centre 42 group of artists, writers, actors and musicians, founded at the Bristol Trades Union Festival of 1962, had taken their name from Resolution 42 passed at the 1960 TUC Congress. Centre 42 was initially a touring festival aimed at devolving art and culture from London to the other main working class towns of Britain, moving to the Roundhouse in 1964. The project to establish a permanent arts centre struggled through subsequent years, because its funding was limited; Wesker fictionalised it in his play &quot;Their Very Own and Golden City&quot; (1966). Wesker dissolved the project formally in 1970, although The Roundhouse did open eventually as a permanent arts centre in 2006.

===Writers &amp; Readers Publishing Cooperative===
Wesker co-founded, in 1974, the Writers &amp; Readers Publishing Cooperative Ltd, with a group of writers that included John Berger, Lisa Appignanesi, Richard Appignanesi, Chris Searle and Glenn Thompson.

==Later works==
&quot;The Journalists&quot; (1972) was commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company and researched at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; at a time it when was edited by Harold Evans. The RSC&#x27;s literary manager Ronald Bryden thought it would be &quot;the play of the decade&quot; and it was scheduled to be directed by David Jones. The actors in that year&#x27;s RSC company refused to perform it, Wesker said, because they were under the influence of the Workers Revolutionary Party. (The WRP was not founded until 1973, but its forerunner, the Socialist Labour League had many sympathisers in the RSC.) Wesker wrote in 2004 that he had also &quot;committed the politically incorrect crime of creating Tory ministers who were intelligent rather than caricatures&quot;.

&quot;The Journalists&quot; received its American premiere at the Back Alley Theatre in Los Angeles in 1979. It was directed by Laura Zucker and produced by Allan Miller.

Wesker&#x27;s play &quot;The Merchant&quot; (1976), which he later renamed &quot;Shylock&quot;, uses the same three stories used by Shakespeare for his play &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;.

In this retelling, Shylock and Antonio are fast friends bound by a common love of books, culture and a disdain for the crass antisemitism of the Christian community&#x27;s laws. They make the bond in defiant mockery of the Christian establishment, never anticipating that the bond might become forfeit. When it does, the play argues, Shylock must carry through on the letter of the law or jeopardise the scant legal security of the entire Jewish community. He is, therefore, quite as grateful as Antonio when Portia, as in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, shows the legal way out.

The play received its American premiere on 16 November 1977 at New York&#x27;s Plymouth Theatre with Joseph Leon as Shylock, Marian Seldes as Shylock&#x27;s sister Rivka and Roberta Maxwell as Portia. This production had a challenging history in previews on the road, culminating (after the first night out of town in Philadelphia on 8 September 1977) with the death of the exuberant Broadway star Zero Mostel, who was initially cast as Shylock.

Wesker wrote a book, &quot;The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel&quot;, chronicling the entire process from initial submissions and rejections of the play through to rehearsals, Zero&#x27;s death, and the disappointment of the critical reception for the Broadway opening. The book reveals much about the playwright&#x27;s relationship to director John Dexter (who had been the earliest, near-familial interpreter of Wesker&#x27;s works), to criticism, to casting, and to the ephemeral process of collaboration through which the text of any play must pass.

In 2005, he published his first novel, &quot;Honey&quot;, which recounted the experiences of Beatie Bryant, the heroine of his earlier play &quot;Roots&quot;. The novel broke from the previously established chronology. &quot;Roots&quot; was set in the early 1960s and Beatie is 22; but in &quot;Honey&quot; she has only aged three years yet the action has been transplanted into the 1980s. Other oddities are that the timeframe includes the Rushdie affair and John Major&#x27;s fall as recent events and yet the action is concerned with the dotcom boom.

In 2008, Wesker published his first collection of poetry, &quot;All Things Tire of Themselves&quot; (Flambard Press). The collection dates back many years and represents what he considered his best and most characteristic poems. He was a member of the editorial advisory board of &quot;Jewish Renaissance&quot; magazine.

He was a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres.

He was the castaway on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, BBC Radio 4, in 1966 and again in 2006.

==Archive==
Wesker&#x27;s papers, covering his entire career, were acquired by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 2000. The collection contains not only the prolific output of the playwright, novelist and poet but also is framed within the larger historical context of international events. Wesker was actively involved in the organizing of his archive, and before shipping it to the Ransom Center, Wesker compiled a list of the contents, which is also available to scholars for consultation. The collection&#x27;s contents include over three hundred boxes of manuscript drafts, correspondence, production ephemera, personal records, and other materials. Wesker&#x27;s family shipped the last of his papers to the Ransom Center in March, 2016 shortly before his death.

On 13 April 2016, the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, gave thanks for the playwright&#x27;s life. They shared a socialist background in London, where Corbyn is an MP.
I am sure the whole House will join me in mourning the death of the dramatist Arnold Wesker, one of the great playwrights of this country, one of those wonderful angry young men of the 1950s who, like so many angry young people, changed the face of our country.
The BBC repeated in May 2016 the retrospective radio programme on Wesker&#x27;s career first broadcast on his 80th birthday.

==Personal life==

Wesker married Doreen Bicker in 1958, after meeting at a hotel in Norwich where Wesker was working as a kitchen porter and Doreen as a chambermaid. He gave her the nickname of &quot;Dusty&quot;, because of her &quot;gold-dust&quot; hair; an Arts Council bursary of £500 covered the cost of their marriage. The character Beatie, in the &quot;Wesker trilogy&quot; of plays, was inspired by her. The couple had three children: Lindsay, Tanya and Daniel. Lindsay was named after director Lindsay Anderson. Tanya died in 2012. Wesker also had another daughter Elsa, with Swedish journalist, Disa Håstad.

Wesker died on 12 April 2016 at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. He was suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Awards and honours==

Wesker received numerous awards throughout his career. In 1958 he received grant of 300 for the play &quot;Chicken Soup&quot; from the Arts Council of Great Britain. He used the money to marry Bicker. The following year he won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award in the &quot;Most Promising Playwright&quot; category. He was presented with the Italian Marzotto Prize (a cash award of £3000) in 1964 for &quot;Their Very Own and Golden City&quot;, and the Spanish Best Foreign Play Award in 1979. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1985 and was presented with the Goldie Award in 1987. For his &quot;distinguished service to theatre&quot; he was honoured with the Last Frontier Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. He was knighted in the 2006 New Year Honours. In December 2021 a plaque in Wesker&#x27;s memory was installed at his former primary school, Northwold Road, Hackney, London, by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation.

<doc id="456937" wikidata="Q5326358" url="?curid=456937" title="Earl of Portsmouth">
<text>Earl of Portsmouth is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. After the death of Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth (c. 19 August 1673 - 14 November 1734), it was created in 1743 for John Wallop, 1st Viscount Lymington, who had previously represented Hampshire in the House of Commons. He had already been created Baron Wallop, of Farleigh Wallop in Hampshire in the County of Southampton, and Viscount Lymington, in 1720, also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The second earl was the son of Catherine Conduitt, whose mother was Catherine Barton, half-niece of the eminent mathematical scientist Sir Isaac Newton. The earls of Portsmouth therefore are direct descendants of Isaac Newton&#x27;s mother, and three of the earls have been named after Newton. The earls were in possession of a large trove of Newton&#x27;s personal papers, until they were auctioned in 1936. Those documents are commonly known as the &quot;Portsmouth Papers&quot;.

The third Earl declared himself King of Hampshire and his brother had him declared insane.

The fourth Earl represented Andover and Devonshire North in Parliament. In 1794, he assumed by Royal licence for himself and his issue the surname and arms of Fellowes only.

The fifth Earl resumed, without Royal licence, the family surname and arms of Wallop.

The sixth Earl represented Barnstaple in Parliament as a Liberal.

Oliver Henry Wallop, the eighth Earl, had moved from England to the United States, and been living the life of a rancher in Sheridan, Wyoming, at the time of the death of his older brother, the seventh Earl. Known as O.H. Wallop, he had served two terms a state representative in the Wyoming Legislature. He had become an American citizen in 1891, and was allowed to take his seat in the House of Lords only after renouncing American citizenship.

The ninth Earl sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Basingstoke.

The current holder is Quentin Wallop, 10th Earl of Portsmouth, who succeeded in 1984, is the only son of Oliver Kintzing Wallop, Viscount Lymington (1923–1984).

The American politician Malcolm Wallop was a grandson of the 8th Earl.

The family seat is Farleigh House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire.

<text>The Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is a Marine Protected Area of the United States located on Prudence, Patience, and Hope islands in Narragansett Bay in the state of Rhode Island.

It was established in August 1980 under the Coastal Zone Management Act. 
The reserve encompasses 2,353 acres (9.5 km2) of land as well as 1,591 acres (6.4 km2) of water adjoining the islands out to a depth of . During the colonial era, all three islands were used for farming. By the 20th century, farming had declined and Prudence Island began to attract summer residents. During World War II, the U.S. military established a presence on the island and remained until 1972, when the land was turned over to the state of Rhode Island.

It encompasses coastal, estuarine, and tidal habitats.

The reserve is managed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management as a federal/state partnership in cooperation with NOAA.

<text>Earl of Buckinghamshire is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1746 for John Hobart, 1st Baron Hobart.

==History==
The Hobart family descends from Henry Hobart, who served as Attorney General and Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. In 1611 he was created a Baronet, of Intwood in the County of Norfolk, in the Baronetage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He represented Cambridge, Lostwithiel, Brackley and Norfolk in the House of Commons. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his nephew, the third Baronet. He was the son of Sir Miles Hobart, younger son of the first Baronet. Hobart sat as Member of Parliament for Norfolk. In 1656 he married Mary, daughter of the prominent politician John Hampden.

He was succeeded by his elder son, the fourth Baronet. He was a General of the Horse and was equerry to King William III at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. He also represented Norfolk, King&#x27;s Lynn and Bere Alston in Parliament. Hobart was killed in a duel in 1698. His son, the fifth Baronet, served as Treasurer of the Chamber, as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners and as Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk. In 1728 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Hobart, of Blickling in the County of Norfolk, and in 1746 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Buckinghamshire, also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

On his death, the titles passed to his son from his first marriage, the second Earl. He served as Comptroller of the Household, as Ambassador to Russia and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his half-brother, the third Earl. He represented St Ives and Bere Alston in the House of Commons. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, was a prominent politician. He served as Governor of Madras, as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as Joint Postmaster General and as President of the Board of Control. In 1797 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Hobart. The town of Hobart, Tasmania, was named in honour of Lord Buckinghamshire.
He died without male issue and was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. George Vere Hobart, second son of the third Earl. Lord Buckinghamshire briefly represented St Michael&#x27;s in Parliament. In 1824 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Hampden. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. He was a clergyman. In 1878 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Hampden. He was succeeded by his grandson, the seventh Earl. He was the second but only surviving son of Frederick John Hobart-Hampden, Lord Hobart, second son of the sixth Earl. Lord Buckinghamshire served briefly as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in 1895 in the Liberal administration of the Earl of Rosebery. He married Georgiana Wilhelmina Haldane-Duncan-Mercer-Henderson, daughter of the Hon. Hew Adam Dalrymple Hamilton Haldane-Duncan-Mercer-Henderson and Edith Isabella Mercer-Henderson. In 1903 Lord Buckinghamshire assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of Mercer-Henderson.

On his death, the titles passed to his only son, the eighth Earl. He was Deputy Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords and a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords. In 1938 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Mercer-Henderson only in lieu of Hobart-Hampden-Mercer-Henderson. He never married and on his death in 1963 the line of the second son of the sixth Earl failed. He was succeeded by his second cousin, the ninth Earl. He was the grandson of the Hon. Charles Edward Hobart-Hampden, fourth son of the sixth Earl. He was childless and was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, the tenth Earl and () present holder of the titles. He is the great-grandson of the Hon. George Augustus Hobart-Hampden, fifth son of the sixth Earl (and the eldest from his second marriage).

Several other members of the Hobart family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Henry Hobart, younger son of the first Earl from his second marriage, represented Norwich in Parliament and served as Chairman of Ways and Means. Vere Henry Hobart, Lord Hobart, eldest son of the sixth Earl, was Governor of Madras. The Hon. Augustus Charles Hobart-Hampden, third son of the sixth Earl, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. Also, Henrietta Hobart, daughter of the fourth Baronet and sister of the first Earl, was a longtime mistress of King George II.

The family seat was Hampden House, near Great Hampden, Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="456951" wikidata="Q586075" url="?curid=456951" title="Bearded barbet">
<text>The bearded barbet (Pogonornis dubius) is an African barbet. Barbets are birds with a worldwide tropical distribution, although New World and Old World barbets are placed in different families. The barbets get their name from the bristles which fringe their heavy bills.

==Taxonomy==
The bearded barbet was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the puffbirds in the genus &quot;Bucco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Bucco dubius&quot;. The specific epithet is Latin meaning &quot;doubtful&quot; or &quot;dubious&quot;. John Latham had earlier included the species in his work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; and had written &quot;This bird inhabits the Coast of Barbary, and if of doubtful genus&quot;. Both Gmelin and Latham based their description on &quot;Le Barbican&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1780 by the French polymath Comte de Buffon. The bearded barbet is now placed with 12 other barbets in the genus &quot;Lybius&quot; that was introduced in 1783 by the French naturalist Johann Hermann. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
This is a conspicuous, large barbet at in overall length. It is fairly plump, with a short neck, large head and a shortish tail. The adult has a black crown, back, tail and breast band. The throat and belly are red and there is a yellow eye patch. The rump is white. The massive bill is very thick and yellow, and the well developed clump of bristles at its base give the species its name. Sexes are similar. The call is a growling .

The bearded barbet is a common resident breeder in tropical west Africa. It is an arboreal species of gardens and wooded country which eats fruit, although the young are fed on insects. It is found in well-wooded areas with plentiful fig trees. It will enter gardens for fruit.

==Behaviour==
The bearded barbet forms social groups of 4-5 birds and pairs or groups roost together in a tree cavity. It nests in a tree hole, laying 2 white eggs.

<doc id="456956" wikidata="Q5326285" url="?curid=456956" title="Earl of Guilford">
<text>Earl of Guilford is a title that has been created three times in history. The title was created for the first time in the Peerage of England in 1660 (as Countess of Guilford) for Elizabeth Boyle. She was a daughter of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh, and the widow of Lewis Boyle, 1st Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky. The title was for life only and became extinct on her death in 1667. The title was created for a second time in the Peerage of England in 1674 for John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale. For more information on this creation, see the article on him as well as the Earl of Lauderdale.

== History ==
Despite the first two creations, the title of Earl of Guilford is chiefly associated with one branch of the North family, which descends from the Hon. Sir Francis North, second son of Dudley North, 4th Baron North (see the Baron North for earlier history of the family), a lawyer and politician. He was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1675 to 1682 and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal from 1682 to 1685. In 1683 he was created Baron Guilford, of Guilford (now spelled Guildford) in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of England. He died in middle age and was succeeded by his son, the second Baron, who briefly served as President of the Board of Trade from 1713 to 1714 and was also Lord-Lieutenant of Essex. His son, the third Baron, represented Banbury in the House of Commons of Great Britain. In 1734 he succeeded his cousin as seventh Baron North and in 1752 was honoured by being created Earl of Guilford in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The first Earl of the new creation was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. Known mainly under his courtesy title of Lord North, which he used from 1752 to 1790, he was one of the most influential statesmen of the second half of the 18th century. As Prime Minister of Great Britain between 1770 and 1782, he was a major figure in the American Revolution. North also held two of the other great offices of state, those of Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He represented several constituencies in the House of Commons. Lord Guilford had no sons, and on his death the barony of North fell into abeyance between his daughters (see the Baron North page for further history of this title). He was succeeded in the barony and the earldom of Guilford by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He had been one of the Members of Parliament for Banbury from 1792 to 1794 and had also served as Governor of Ceylon from 1798 to 1805. He was also childless, and on his death the titles passed to his cousin, the sixth Earl, a clergyman. He was succeeded by his grandson, the seventh Earl. His son, the eighth Earl, was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal East Kent Yeomanry and also Territorial Force Reserve, and a lieutenant in the 4th battalion Gloucester regiment. When he died the peerages were inherited by his grandson, the ninth Earl. As of 2009 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s only son, the tenth Earl, who succeeded in 1999.

Three other members of the North family may also be mentioned. Frederic Dudley North (1866–1921), great-grandson of the Reverend Charles Augustus North, younger brother of the sixth earl, was a prominent civil servant in Australia. His son Charles Frederic North (1887–1979) was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1947 to 1953. Jonathan North (b. 1931), son of the Hon. John Montagu William North, second son of the eighth Earl, succeeded his maternal grandfather as second Baronet, of Southwell, in 1947 (see North Baronets).

Lacking a different secondary title, the heirs apparent to the earldom have continued to use &quot;Lord North&quot; as a courtesy title. An unqualified reference to &quot;Lord North&quot; almost always refers to Frederick North, later second Earl of Guilford.

The family seat is Waldershare House, near Dover, Kent. The town in Surrey from which both titles derive is now spelt &quot;Guildford&quot;.

<doc id="456958" wikidata="Q5326288" url="?curid=456958" title="Earl of Hardwicke">
<text>Earl of Hardwicke is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1754 for Philip Yorke, 1st Baron Hardwicke, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1737 to 1756. He had already been created Baron Hardwicke, of Hardwicke in the County of Gloucestershire, in 1733, and was made Viscount Royston at the same time as he was given the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. 

The first earl was succeeded by his eldest son, who represented Reigate and Cambridgeshire in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. Lord Hardwicke married Lady Jemima Campbell, only daughter of John Campbell, 3rd Earl of Breadalbane, and granddaughter and heiress of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, who succeeded her grandfather as Marchioness Grey in 1722 (a title which became extinct on her death). They had two daughters, the eldest of whom was Lady Amabel, who was created Countess De Grey on her own right in 1816. 

Lord Hardwicke was succeeded by his nephew, the third Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Charles Yorke, second son of the first Earl. He was a prominent politician and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1801 and 1805. Lord Hardwicke died without surviving male issues and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Earl. He was the son of Vice-Admiral Sir Joseph Sydney Yorke, the third son of the aforementioned Charles Yorke. Like his father he was a Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy. Also, he held political office in the first two Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby as Postmaster General and as Lord Privy Seal.

His son, the fifth Earl, was also a Conservative politician and served under Derby as Comptroller of the Household and under Benjamin Disraeli as Master of the Buckhounds. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He also held political office and served in the Conservative administrations of Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and Under-Secretary of State for War. However, he died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his uncle, the seventh Earl. He was a Captain in the Royal Navy. His eldest son, the eighth Earl, was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Alfred Ernest Frederick Yorke, second son of the seventh Earl. the titles are held by the ninth Earl&#x27;s grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded in 1974. He is the only son of Philip Yorke, Viscount Royston (d. 1973), only son of the ninth Earl.

==Other family members==
Numerous other members of the Yorke family have also gained distinction. The Honourable Charles Yorke, second son of the first Earl, was also Lord Chancellor of Great Britain. He was the father of 1) the third Earl, 2) Charles Philip Yorke, Home Secretary between 1803 and 1804, and 3) Sir Joseph Sydney Yorke, an Admiral in the Royal Navy, who was the father of the Honourable Eliot Yorke, Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire. The Honourable Joseph Yorke, third son of the first Earl, was a soldier, politician and diplomat and was created Baron Dover in 1788. The Honourable John Yorke, fourth son of the first Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Reigate and Higham Ferrers. The Right Reverend the Honourable James Yorke, fifth son of the first Earl, was Bishop of Ely. He was the father of 1) Joseph Yorke, who was the father of Joseph Yorke, Member of Parliament for Reigate, who was the father of John Yorke, a Conservative politician, who was the grandfather of the author Henry Green; and 2) Reverend Philip Yorke, who was the father of Colonel Philip James Yorke (1799–1874), a Fellow of the Royal Society, and Reginald Yorke (1803–1870), a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy.

Lady Jemima Yorke, wife of the second Earl, succeeded her maternal grandfather as Marchioness Grey in 1740. Lady Amabel Yorke, elder daughter of the second Earl, was created Countess de Grey in 1816 (see Marquess of Ripon). Lady Mary Yorke, the younger daughter of the second Earl, was the mother of Prime Minister F. J. Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon. Philip Yorke, Viscount Royston, eldest son of the third Earl, was Member of Parliament for Reigate. The Honourable Elliot Yorke, fourth son of the fourth Earl, was a Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire. Sir William Yorke, 1st Baronet, cousin of the first Earl, was a judge in Ireland.

<text>Wishmaster is a 1997 American dark fantasy horror film directed by Robert Kurtzman. The film was executive produced by Wes Craven, and is the only film of the &quot;Wishmaster&quot; series with his name attached. Its plot concerns a djinn, a wish-granting, evil genie who is released from a jewel and seeks to capture the soul of the woman who discovered him, thereby opening a portal and freeing his fellow djinn to inhabit and enslave the Earth.

The film stars Andrew Divoff as The Djinn and Tammy Lauren.

The film was followed by three sequels, &quot;Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies&quot; (1999), &quot;Wishmaster 3: Beyond the Gates of Hell&quot; (2001) and &quot;&quot; (2002).

==Plot==
In 1127, a djinn asks a Persian emperor to make his second wish. When the emperor wishes to see wonders, the Djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. The emperor is horrified, but the Djinn tells him to use his third wish to set things right. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer, explains the consequences of the third wish, as it will free legions of djinn on Earth. He then reveals a fire opal, which pulls the Djinn inside and traps him.

In present-day America, Raymond Beaumont supervises workers lowering a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship. The crane operator, Mickey Torelli, is drunk and drops the box, killing Beaumont&#x27;s assistant Ed Finley and destroying the statue. A dockworker steals the fire opal from the rubble and pawns it. Eventually, the jewel reaches Regal Auctioneers, where Nick Merritt instructs appraiser Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Amberson to examine it, which wakes the Djinn. Alex sees something inside the jewel and leaves it with her close friend and colleague, Josh Aickman, to analyze. As he collects data, the gem explodes, destroying the lab and releasing the Djinn. Josh, wounded, wishes for relief from his physical pain, and the Djinn grants his wish by killing him.

Alex, having been informed of Josh&#x27;s death by Lieutenant Nathanson, tracks the gem to the statue which she tracks to Beaumont, who sends Alex to visit Wendy Derleth, a folklore professor. Wendy explains the history of the gem and the nature of the djinn: a djinn grants wishes in exchange for souls, but as djinns are demonic in nature, the wishes will be twisted into curses for the djinn&#x27;s amusement. Later, Alex learns that the Djinn needs to power the gem with human souls and then grant her (the person who originally released him) three wishes before he can open the gateway to release his fellow djinn on Earth. Meanwhile, the Djinn takes the form of a dead man and uses the name Nathaniel Demerest. He kills a pharmacist with the wish of a vengeful vagrant and grants sales clerk Ariella&#x27;s wish for eternal beauty by turning her into a mannequin. Searching for Alex, he goes to Nathanson to gain her information. Nathanson refuses to help him, but the Djinn grants Nathanson&#x27;s wish to easily prove a criminal&#x27;s guilt by having the criminal go on a shooting spree inside the police precinct, and in the chaos finds Alex&#x27;s home address and leaves.

He next visits Nick, Nick agrees to help in exchange for a million dollars, which he receives when his mother takes out a life insurance policy and is killed in a plane explosion.

Alex sees troubling visions every time the Djinn grants wishes. She consults Derleth again but soon realizes she is actually talking to the Djinn, who has killed Derleth and taken her form. The Djinn confronts Alex and offers her three wishes. In the spirit of fair play, he offers her a &quot;free&quot; wish, to see what will happen. She wishes for him to shoot himself, but he is immortal and the gunshot fails to harm him. Using the first of her three official wishes, Alex wishes to know what he is. The Djinn teleports her to his hellish world within the gem which terrifies her as he boasts of his evil to her. She then wishes to escape back to her apartment, alone.

The Djinn had been threatening Alex&#x27;s sister, Shannon, so Alex hurried to a party Beaumont had invited them to earlier. The Djinn follows, again disguised as Nathaniel Demerest. Alex tells doorman Johnny Valentine to hold the Djinn, as he is trying to kill her; however, the Djinn manipulates Valentine into making a wish &quot;to escape his routine life&quot; and have a more exciting profession, allowing the Djinn to trap and kill Valentine, making his way into the party. The Djinn charms Beaumont, who wishes his party would be unforgettable, and thus the Djinn causes the artwork in his party to come to life and kill Beaumont, the guests, and the security guards called in to help. Eventually, the Djinn corners the sisters and attempts to scare Alex into making her third wish by trapping Shannon in a burning painting.

Alex, after calming herself so she can focus, wishes that crane operator Mickey Torelli had not been drunk at work two days ago, which the Djinn is forced to grant. This, however, undoes the events that followed the statue&#x27;s destruction and traps the Djinn in the fire opal again, as the now sober Torelli lowers the crate with no problems. Alex visits Josh, who is now alive again, and notices that Alex seems pleased with herself, though she does not explain why. Inside the jewel in the statue of Ahura Mazda, now in Beaumont&#x27;s private collection, the Djinn sits on a throne, waiting to be released.

==Production==

===Casting and cameos===
&quot;Wishmaster&quot; is notable for featuring many actors from popular horror films. Robert Englund, who was Freddy Krueger in the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series, played an antique collector and Kane Hodder, who played Jason Voorhees in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series, played a security guard. Also in the film were Tony Todd from &quot;Candyman&quot;, Ted Raimi from &quot;Candyman&quot;, &quot;Darkman&quot;, &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, Ricco Ross from &quot;Aliens&quot;, Joseph Pilato from &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, Reggie Bannister and the voice of Angus Scrimm (from the &quot;Phantasm&quot; films), Jenny O&#x27;Hara from the later &quot;Devil&quot;, actor Jack Lemmon&#x27;s son Chris Lemmon from &quot;Just Before Dawn&quot;, and George &#x27;Buck&#x27; Flower (who was often used in small parts in various horror movies of the 1980s and early 1990s, often directed by John Carpenter). Verne Troyer of later &quot;Austin Powers&quot; fame appears as the smaller Wishmaster when he first escapes from his gem prison. A Pazuzu statue, a personification of the demonic figure which possessed Linda Blair&#x27;s character in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; series, also appeared. This can be seen in Beaumont&#x27;s collection room and on display during the party scene where it attacks some of the guests, though it is not formally referenced. A veiled reference to the Cthulhu Mythos can be heard in the incantation used to imprison the Djinn; the words &quot;Nib Shuggurath&quot;, a spoonerism of Shub-Niggurath. Another Lovecraft reference appears in the character name of Wendy Derleth (Jenny O&#x27;Hara); August Derleth (1909-1971) was a publisher and anthologist who was the first book publisher of the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, and a long-time contributor of new works in the Cthulu Mythos. Makeup artist Tom Savini also appears in a cameo as a customer at the pharmacy when Reggie Bannister&#x27;s character dies.

Many crew members, including director Robert Kurtzman (man killed by piano), had small cameos in the film.

===Writing===
Writer Peter Atkins, also known for his work on &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films, intentionally made some surnames of characters in the film (Beaumont, Finney, Etchison, Clegg, Derleth, Merritt and Aickman) match the names of writers of horror and fantasy fiction. Josh Aickman (played by Tony Crane), explains to Alexandra Amberson (played by Tammy Lauren) that he cannot test the opal immediately because he has, &quot;...about 2 hours&#x27; worth of Professor Leiber&#x27;s bullshit to take care of first.&quot; This Professor does not make an appearance in the film and is not listed in the credits but is a reference to horror, fantasy, science fiction writer Fritz Leiber.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Wishmaster&quot; was shot on an estimated budget of US$5 million and its total domestic gross was US$15,738,769. During its opening weekend in theaters, 19–21 September 1997, &quot;Wishmaster&quot; made US$6 million, putting it in third place at the box office, behind &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (which was debuting in first place) and &quot;The Game&quot; (which was in second place during its second week).

===Critical response===
The film was negatively received overall by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 25% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 3.97/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Wishmaster&quot; searches for horror in the exploits of a supernatural being—one whose powers, alas, evidently do not include the ability to summon a compelling script&quot;.

Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;an extravaganza of bad special effects and worse acting&quot;. Of the few positive reviews, &quot;The Times of Northwest Indiana&quot; critic Christopher Sheid gave it a B+ and stated that &quot;considering that the djinn itself is essentially a combination of Pinhead and Freddy, it&#x27;s safe to say &quot;Wishmaster&quot; is a movie respectful of its influences. It&#x27;s also respectful of its audience&#x27;s intelligence, which is to say this shocker doesn&#x27;t bore us with the pretense of trying to be smart... You couldn&#x27;t wish for a better low-budget fright flick.&quot;

==Novelization==
In 2020, an official novelization of the film was written by Christian Francis and published by Encyclopocalypse Publications.

<doc id="456960" wikidata="Q5326295" url="?curid=456960" title="Earl of Ilchester">
<text>Earl of Ilchester is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1756 for Stephen Fox, 1st Baron Ilchester, who had previously represented Shaftesbury in Parliament. He had already been created Baron Ilchester, of Ilchester in the County of Somerset in 1741, and Baron Ilchester and Stavordale, of Redlynch, in the County of Somerset, in 1747. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. All three peerages were created with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his younger brother Henry Fox, who was himself created Baron Holland in 1763. The brothers were the only sons from the second marriage of the politician Sir Stephen Fox.

In 1758 the first Earl assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Strangways, which was the maiden name of his wife&#x27;s maternal grandmother. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Midhurst in Parliament. His eldest son, the third Earl, served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1835 to 1841 in the Whig administration of Lord Melbourne and was also Lord Lieutenant of Somerset from 1837 to 1839. Lord Ilchester survived both his sons and was succeeded by his half-brother, the fourth Earl. He was Ambassador to the German Confederation from 1840 to 1849. His nephew, the fifth Earl, was Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms from 1873 to 1874 in the Liberal government of William Ewart Gladstone and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset from 1885 to 1905. On the death in 1964 of his grandson, the seventh Earl, the line of the eldest son of the first Earl failed. The seventh Earl was succeeded by his fourth cousin, the eighth Earl. the titles are held by his grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded his uncle in 2006.

The family seat was Melbury House, near Evershot, Dorset. The family, through Ilchester Estates, owns and manages large portions of land in the county of Dorset and the Holland House estate west of Holland Park in Kensington, London. The family inherited much land in the 17th century from the Wadham family of Merryfield, Ilton in Somerset and of Edge, Branscombe in Devon, and in 1874 from their distant cousins the Fox family of Holland House, Kensington.

<doc id="456965" wikidata="Q11331836" url="?curid=456965" title="The Fire Engines">
<text>The Fire Engines were a post-punk band from Edinburgh, Scotland.

The Fire Engines were an influence on many bands that followed, including Franz Ferdinand and The Rapture, with Meat Whiplash and The Candyskins both taking their names from Fire Engines songs. In August 2017 the band reformed to play a benefit for Leith Theatre along with Irvine Welsh and Ewen Bremner.

==History==
The Fire Engines comprise David (Davy) Henderson (vocals/guitar), Murray Slade (guitar), Graham Main (bass), and Russell Burn (drums). The band name was inspired by a 13th Floor Elevators song. Henderson, Main, and Burn had previously been members of The Dirty Reds, along with Russell Burn&#x27;s brother Tam Dean Burn, while Slade had played in Station Six. The Fire Engines&#x27; debut release was the &quot;Get Up And Use Me&quot;/&quot;Everything&#x27;s Roses&quot; single, released on manager Angus Groovy&#x27;s Codex Communications label in 1980; The band had recorded their entire set twice in a Fife bungalow with producer Wilf Smarties, at a cost of £46, with these two tracks selected for release. 

&quot;Get Up and Use Me&quot; was given &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; in both &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;. The band&#x27;s live shows rarely lasted longer than twenty minutes – Henderson said of the early live shows: &quot;We played to our strengths which were minimal, but somehow, as a band, it worked. We never played chords and Russell didn’t use cymbals or hi-hats. It was very violent although no-one got hurt. Pure aggression, attitude and hate was what it was.&quot; The band were offered a deal by Postcard Records, but opted for Bob Last&#x27;s Fast Product label. Further singles followed and a largely instrumental album, &quot;Lubricate Your Living Room&quot; (subtitled &#x27;Background Music for Action People!&#x27;), in 1981, released on Fast subsidiary Pop:Aural. The band recorded two sessions for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show, the first in February 1981 featuring a cover version of Heaven 17&#x27;s &quot;(We Don&#x27;t Need This) Fascist Groove Thang&quot;, and a second in November that year. Their most successful single was &quot;Candy Skin&quot;, released in 1981, but after the follow-up, &quot;Big Gold Dream&quot; failed to repeat its success, the band split up on 31 December 1981.

Henderson formed the short-lived Heartbeat with Bob Last&#x27;s partner Hillary Morrison, the band&#x27;s only release a track on an &quot;NME&quot; compilation cassette. Burn formed Everest the Hard Way with bassist Ian Stoddart and guitarist Stephen Lironi (who later joined Altered Images), the band releasing a single in April 1982, before Burn rejoined The Dirty Reds. Henderson and Burn went on to form Win with Stoddart in the mid 1980s, the band continuing until 1989. Henderson and Burn then worked together on Burn&#x27;s Pie Finger project, releasing an album on Creation Records in 1992. Henderson then formed The Nectarine No. 9, which continued from the early 1990s until 2004.

==Reformation==
In 2004, the Fire Engines reformed to support The Magic Band at The Liquid Room in Edinburgh, and released a limited edition collaboration single with Franz Ferdinand; The seven-inch single contained a Franz Ferdinand cover of the Fire Engines song &quot;Get Up and Use Me&quot; with Fire Engines covering Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s &quot;Jacqueline&quot;. The band continued to play occasional concerts until 2006. On 2 October 2007, the Acute label issued &quot;Hungry Beat&quot;, a collection of the band&#x27;s original studio recordings, making them available for the first time on CD in the US.

Henderson is now leading The Sexual Objects, featuring Ian Holford (drums), Simon Smeeton (guitar) and Douglas McIntyre (bass). Graham Wann later joined as guitarist. The band released a single on the Creeping Bent label in 2007, two singles through a German label in 2008 and one more in 2009. Their debut album, &quot;Cucumber&quot;, was released in 2010, partially produced by Boards of Canada (who produced the third single). It was released on vinyl in 2011.

<text>The National Estuarine Research Reserve System is a network of 30 protected areas established by partnerships between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and coastal states. The reserves represent different biogeographic regions of the United States. The National Estuarine Research Reserve System protects more than 1.3 million acres of coastal and estuarine habitats for long-term research, water-quality monitoring, education, and coastal stewardship.

==Background==
For thousands of years, coastal and estuarine environments have provided people with food, safe harbors, transportation access, flood control, and a place to play and relax. The pressures on the nation&#x27;s coast are enormous and the impacts on economies and ecosystems are becoming increasingly evident. Severe storms, climate change, pollution, habitat alteration and rapid population growth threaten the ecological functions that have supported coastal communities throughout history. Estuaries are the connection between the ocean (or Great Lakes) and the land and humans depend on both for their very existence, so caring for both – and the connection between them – is vital to humans.

The System was established by the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972 as estuarine sanctuaries and was renamed to estuarine research reserves in the 1988 reauthorization of the CZMA. NOAA provides funding, national guidance and technical assistance. Each reserve is managed on daily basis by a lead state agency or university, with input from local partners.

Reserve staff work with local communities and regional groups to address natural resource management issues, such as non-point source pollution, habitat restoration and invasive species. Through integrated research and education, the reserves help communities develop strategies to deal successfully with these coastal resource issues. Reserves provide adult audiences with training on estuarine issues of concern in their local communities, offer field classes for K-12 students, and provide estuary education to teachers through the Teachers on the Estuary program. Reserves also provide long-term water quality monitoring as well as opportunities for both scientists and graduate students to conduct research in a &quot;living laboratory&quot;.

==Core programs==
===Research and monitoring===
The National Estuarine Research Reserves serve as living laboratories to support coastal research and long-term monitoring and to provide facilities for on-site staff, visiting scientists and graduate students. They also serve as reference sites for comparative studies on coastal topics such as ecosystem dynamics, human influences on estuarine systems, habitat conservation and restoration, species management, and social science. Additionally, the reserves serve as sentinel sites to better understand the effects of climate change.

The goals of the Reserve System&#x27;s research and monitoring program include:
*ensuring a stable environment for research through long-term protection of Reserve resources
*addressing coastal management issues through coordinated estuarine research within the System
*collecting information necessary for improved understanding and management of estuarine areas, and making the information available to stakeholders

Each reserve works on a variety of research projects, in addition to participating in the System-wide Monitoring Program. The topics of these projects are varied and depend on local needs and issues, as well as issues of national concern. Topics may include issues such as investigating the impacts of non-point source pollution, understanding the role of social science in coastal resource management, and controlling invasive species.

====System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP)====
The System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP, pronounced &quot;swamp&quot;) was established in 1995 as a means of observing short-term variability and long-term changes in estuarine regions. Each reserve participates in SWMP which provides researchers, resource managers, educators, and other coastal decision makers with standardized, quantitative measures to determine how reserve conditions are changing. By using standard operating procedures for each component across all 30 reserves, SWMP data helps establish the reserves as a system of national reference sites, as well a network of sentinel sites for detecting and understanding the effects of climate change in coastal regions.

SWMP currently has three major components that focus on:
*abiotic indicators of water quality and weather
*biological monitoring
*watershed, habitat, and land use mapping

Abiotic parameters include nutrients, temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and in some cases, contaminants. Biological monitoring includes measures of biodiversity, habitat, and population characteristics. Watershed and land use classifications provide information on types of land use by humans and changes in land cover associated with each reserve.
SWMP data for each reserve are managed by the Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO), which is managed through a grant to the University of South Carolina and is housed at the North Inlet-Winyah Bay Reserve in South Carolina. SWMP data can be viewed and downloaded from the CDMO.

====NERRS Science Collaborative====
The NERRS Science Collaborative is designed to put Reserve-based science to work for local communities. Administered by the University of Michigan (UM), the program funds research projects that bring scientists, intended users of the science, stakeholders, educators, and trainers together to address problems related to coastal pollution and habitat degradation in the context of climate change. The results of these projects is shared throughout the System. The Collaborative also sponsors a UM-based graduate and professional education program focused on helping individuals develop the skills needed to link science-based information to coastal resource management decisions.

===Education===
National Estuarine Research Reserves are federally designated &quot;to enhance public awareness and understanding of estuarine areas, and provide suitable opportunities for public education and interpretation.&quot; Each research reserve is an active member of the local and regional education community and a representative of the state and NOAA stewardship community. The reserve system takes a local approach in advancing estuarine education and generating meaningful experiences for all kinds of people interested in learning about, protecting and restoring estuaries.

The Estuary Education Program strives to enhance student, teacher, and public awareness, understanding, and appreciation of estuaries by providing hands-on, investigative field experiences, curriculum and information material, multi-exposure opportunities, teacher training programs, and public outreach events. The Estuary Education Network is working to advance estuary, climate &amp; ocean literacy. Estuaries can be used as a powerful context to support learning about the interconnections and interdependencies between terrestrial and ocean systems, what important services they provide for humans, and how to restore and protect them.

===Training===
The National Estuarine Research Reserve System&#x27;s Coastal Training Program (CTP) was formally initiated in 2001 to provide up-to-date scientific information and skill-building opportunities to the people who are responsible for making decisions affecting coastal lands and waters of the United States. Through this program, National Estuarine Research Reserves can ensure that coastal decision-makers have the knowledge and tools they need to address critical resource management issues of concern to local communities. Coastal Training Programs offered by reserves focus on issues such as stormwater management, community development, restoration science, land use planning and others. Since 2006, these reserve-based programs have delivered more than 400 evaluated training events reaching at least 13,000 decision-makers in the coastal zone.

===Stewardship===
A core mission of the Reserves is to protect and conserve the more than 1.3 million acres of coastal and estuarine habitat within reserves and to facilitate improved stewardship of coastal habitats outside reserve boundaries. The Reserve System&#x27;s stewardship approach uses the best available science to maintain and restore healthy, productive and resilient ecosystems, and disseminates information to regional and national stakeholders. Site-based stewardship strategies assess and respond to threats from coastal development, human use of reserve resources, climate change, and invasive species.

====Stewardship issues addressed by NERRS====
=====Invasive species=====
Invasive species are species not native to an ecosystem, and whose introduction to that ecosystem can harm the environment, public health or welfare. Reserves manage for invasive species through preventing new introductions and through managed removal if appropriate.

=====Species of concern=====
Reserves manage and restore habitat to support species of concern by restoring degraded habitat, enhancing habitat connectivity to support multiple life stages of particular species, managing visitor use pressure during critical life stages and restoring species and habitats such as native oysters and sea grass beds where possible. Reserves also work within the watershed to identify, protect, and restore critical habitat for estuarine species such as salmon.

=====Fire management=====
Many reserves manage habitat that require fire to survive. Fire management through prescribed burns is particularly challenging as these areas often are located near development. Many reserves manage these fire dependent habitats and monitor habitat and species recovery.

=====Hydrologic restoration=====
Development along our nation&#x27;s estuaries often results in hydrologic restrictions from roads, dykes, and railroads. These restrictions alter habitat, water quality, and species distribution. Many reserves are addressing these impacts by managing or restoring hydrology through the replacement of culverts, management of tide gates, and/or removal of dykes.

=====Water quality=====
Water quality is a fundamental indicator of the impacts from coastal watersheds and the health of estuarine ecosystems. Good water quality affects coastal habitat quality and human communities that rely on estuaries for recreation and livelihoods. Water quality parameters such as clarity, oxygen content, nutrient concentration, temperature, sedimentation, pH, salinity and others all have profound impacts on natural and human communities in coastal ecosystems.

The reserves are addressing water quality through intensive abiotic monitoring of estuarine habitats through the System-Wide Monitoring Program, working with farmers to develop and monitor best management practices from agriculture, monitoring the impacts of canopy cover on salmon habitats, addressing sedimentation impacts into coastal streams by working with adjacent land owners and evaluating land use impacts through tools such as the Non-Point Source Pollution, Erosion and Control (NSPECT) tool.

=====Habitat alteration=====
Coastal and estuarine habitats include marshes, forested wetlands, oyster reefs, seagrass beds, beaches, tidal streams, and riparian forests. These habitats are vital not only for fish, birds, and other wildlife, but for human communities as well. They help to protect against flooding, improve water quality, provide recreational opportunities, and support commercial fisheries and tourism. Restoring habitats helps ecosystems by removing pollutants and invasive species, re-establishing natural ecosystem processes, and re-introducing native plants and other wildlife.

The Reserves are working with several NOAA programs and a variety of regional partners to improve the science in support of habitat restoration, restore coastal habitats, control invasive species, protect habitat through acquisition, and implement land management practices that balance the needs for conservation and public access.

=====Habitat mapping and change=====
The Reserve System&#x27;s Habitat Mapping and Change Plan was developed in 2007 to establish the framework for mapping habitats in reserves for long-term change related to local sea-level change and human-caused stress from reserve watersheds.
The habitat mapping and change plan is supported by additional documents including the NERR Land Cover and Habitat Classification System and associated implementation protocols and documentation.

=====Restoration=====
As living laboratories, the reserves are ideal settings to investigate the restoration and protection of estuarine and coastal habitat. Because of their federally protected status, biogeographic diversity, on-site facilities, long-term monitoring programs and data, and professional staff capabilities in science and education, the reserves are excellent platforms for advancing the science of restoration, staging demonstration restoration projects, and monitoring their long-term response. Most reserves have extensive areas of undisturbed habitat. These are useful as long-term scientific reference sites for understanding estuarine ecosystems and comparing them with other more disturbed habitats in similar physical settings.

To date, the majority of the reserves have engaged in restoration science and have planned or conducted small to medium-scale restoration projects (0.5 to 250 acres). An inventory of key habitats at the reserves and restoration activities and priorities conducted in 2000 and updated in 2001 is summarized in the NERRS Restoration Science Strategy. Reserves have investigated both engineering and natural approaches to restore areas to approximate natural, unaltered conditions. Several reserves must first address water quality issues and/or restore hydrologic regimes (i.e. sheet flow, tidal exchange, and freshwater drainage) before they can restore terrestrial and aquatic native plant communities and achieve faunal and ecological recovery.

<doc id="456970" wikidata="Q5325816" url="?curid=456970" title="Earl De La Warr">
<text>Earl De La Warr ( ) is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1761 for John West, 7th Baron De La Warr. The Earl holds the subsidiary titles of Viscount Cantelupe (1761) in the Peerage of Great Britain, Baron De La Warr (1572) in the Peerage of England, and [[Baron Buckhurst]], of Buckhurst in the County of Sussex (1864) in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony De La Warr is of the second creation; however, it bears the precedence of the first creation, 1299, and has done so since shortly after the death of William West, 1st Baron De La Warr. The family seat is Buckhurst Park, near Withyham, Sussex.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;de La Warr&quot; is from Sussex and of Anglo-French origin. It may have come from &quot;La Guerre&quot;, a Norman &quot;lieu-dit&quot;. This toponymic could derive from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, from the Breton &quot;,&quot; or from the Late Latin &quot;&quot; (fallow). The toponyms Gara, Gaire also appear in old texts cited by Lucien Musset, where the word &quot;ga(i)ra&quot; means gore. It could also be linked with a patronymic from the Old Norse &quot;&quot;.

The barony and earldom are both pronounced &quot;De La Ware&quot;, as in the American state of Delaware.

The subsidiary title &quot;Viscount Cantelupe&quot; commemorates the West family&#x27;s descent from the Anglo-Norman Cantilupe family. In the fourteenth century Sir Thomas West married Eleanor, heiress of Sir John de Cantilupe. Their son, also Thomas, inherited Hempston Cantilupe and was the father of Thomas West, 1st Baron West.

==Baronies of De La Warr==
The barony De La Warr is of the second creation; however, it bears the precedence of the first creation, 1299, and has done so since shortly after the death of William West, 1st Baron De La Warr. The precise legal situation concerning the second creation is murky. The modern rules attempt to regularize medieval practice, but there are many cases that cannot easily be made to fit, whether because a local custom was involved, or because an exception was made, or because the rules were still in flux. This is such a case because William West was &quot;heir male&quot; but not &quot;heir general&quot;. Because the original barony was created by writ, the descent is presumed to be to the heir (or heirs) general, and therefore it fell into abeyance between the daughters of Sir Owen West (and their heirs in turn). The second creation has been viewed in at least three ways:
* As a means of placing beyond dispute an inheritance that should have gone to the heir male in the first place. The act concerning precedence is understood as rectifying the side effect this had of altering the precedence. Accordingly, some writers ignore the second creation when numbering: thus Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, is sometimes called the 12th Baron De La Warr.
* As an extraordinary act resolving an important estate that should not be left in abeyance. In this case, the previous barony was intended to be extinguished and the act altering precedence is difficult to understand other than as political expediency.
* As a part of an effort to solve relatively complex problems of inheritance case by case, before the doctrine of abeyance (as it now exists) had been worked out.

==Connection to American geographical names==

In United States history books, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr is often named simply as &quot;Lord Delaware&quot;. He served as governor of the Jamestown Colony in Virginia, and Delaware Bay was named after him. The state of Delaware, the Delaware River, and the Delaware Indian tribe were so-called after the bay, and thus ultimately derive their names from the barony. Many other American counties, townships, and the like derive their names directly or indirectly from this connection.

==Other family members==
Notable 20th-century descendants of George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr include the authors Lady Margaret Sackville, Vita Sackville-West, Nigel Nicolson and Adam Nicolson.

Another member of the West family was William Cornwallis-West (1835–1917), who was the grandson of the Hon. Frederick West, youngest son of the second Earl. Cornwallis-West was the father of George Cornwallis-West; Daisy, Princess of Pless; and Constance, Duchess of Westminster.

<text>Charles Everett &quot;Charlie&quot; Dumas (February 12, 1937 – January 5, 2004) was an American high jumper, the 1956 Olympic champion, and the first person to clear 7 ft.(2.13 m)

==Biography==
Dumas started his jumping career as a student first at Thomas Jefferson High School in South Central Los Angeles for 2 years. As a sophomore, he finished tied for 4th place at the 1953 CIF California State Meet for Jefferson. As a junior and senior he jumped for Centennial High School in Compton finishing second in 1954 and winning the state championship by four and a half inches in 1955. He was &quot;Track and Field News&quot; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1955.

While attending Compton College, near Los Angeles, Dumas, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, made his memorable jump on June 29, 1956, in the US Olympic Trials in Los Angeles, breaking a barrier previously thought unbreakable.

This jump not only ensured him of a place in the American Olympic team, but also made him the top favorite for the gold medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. He did not disappoint, and grabbed the title in a new Olympic Record.

Next, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, winning the NCAA track and field title with the university team in 1958. In 1960, Dumas competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, but a knee injury during the competition prevented him from winning a second medal, finishing 6th.

After his career, in which he won five consecutive national high jump titles, Dumas became a teacher, working at several schools in the Los Angeles area (including Jordan High School in Watts).

He died of cancer at age 66 in Inglewood, California. He left behind three children: Keasha, Kyle and Ianna.

<doc id="456974" wikidata="Q2991031" url="?curid=456974" title="Earl of Radnor">
<text>Earl of Radnor, of the County of Radnor, is a title which has been created twice. It was first created in the Peerage of England in 1679 for John Robartes, 2nd Baron Robartes, a notable political figure of the reign of Charles II. The earldom was created for a second time in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1765 for William Bouverie, 2nd Viscount Folkestone. 

The Bouverie family descends from William des Bouverie, a prominent London merchant. He was created a baronet of St Catherine Cree Church, London, in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1714. His eldest son, the second Baronet, represented Shaftesbury in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baronet. He sat as Member of Parliament for Salisbury until he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Longford and Viscount Folkestone in 1747.

His son, the second Viscount, also represented Salisbury in Parliament. In 1765 he was made Baron Pleydell-Bouverie, of Coleshill in the County of Berkshire, and Earl of Radnor. The earldom was created with remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to the heirs male of his father. Both peerages were in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was Member of Parliament for Salisbury and served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. The second Earl assumed the additional surname of Pleydell after succeeding to the estates of his maternal grandfather, Sir Mark Stuart Pleydell, 1st Baronet (see Pleydell Baronets). His son, the third Earl, represented Downton and Salisbury in the House of Commons. On his death the titles passed to his son, the fourth Earl. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire.

He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for South Wiltshire and Enfield and held political office as Treasurer of the Household from 1885 to 1886 under Lord Salisbury. His son, the sixth Earl, represented Wilton (also known as South Wiltshire) in Parliament as a Conservative and served as Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire. He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He notably held the honorary posts of Keeper of the Privy Seal and Lord Warden of the Stannaries and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1962. As of 2009, the titles are held by his grandson, also William Pleydell-Bouverie, the 9th Earl of Radnor, who succeeded his father in 2008.

Successive Earls of Radnor were governors of the French Hospital from the eighteenth century to 2015.

The family seats are Longford Castle, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, and Alward House, near Alderbury, Wiltshire. Before 1952, another seat was Coleshill House in Coleshill, Berkshire (presently Oxfordshire).

==Present peer==
William Pleydell-Bouverie, 9th Earl of Radnor (born 5 January 1955) is the eldest son of the 8th Earl and his wife Anne Garden Farquharson Seth-Smith. Styled as Viscount Folkestone from 1968, he was educated at Harrow School and the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. In 2003, he was living at Alward House, Alderbury, Wiltshire.

In 2008 Folkestone succeeded his father as Earl of Radnor (G.B., 1765), Viscount Folkestone (G.B., 1747), and Baron Longford (G.B., 1747), and Baron Pleydell-Bouverie (G.B., 1765). He also inherited a baronetcy, Bouverie of St. Catherine Cree Church, London (G.B., 1714). In 1996 he married Melissa Stanford, only daughter of James Keith Edward Stanford. They have five children.
===Ancestry and extended family===
In an episode of the Dutch television show &quot;Verborgen Verleden&quot; (similar to the British &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;) broadcast in November 2014, the Dutch architect Jan des Bouvrie found that his family was descended from Jehan de le Bouvrie (born about 1480), of Sainghin-en-Mélantois, where in 1543 his widow, Jeanne de la Motte, inherited a farm with four cows and two horses. A grandson of Jehan, the merchant Lawrence de Bouverie, born in Sainghin, migrated to England, where his descendant William des Bouverie was created a baronet and became the ancestor of the Earls of Radnor. Jan des Bouvrie hoped to meet the present-day Lord Radnor, but he would not agree to meet him for the television show.

<text>Earl Bathurst, of Bathurst in the County of Sussex, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The medieval English word was Botehurst, thought to date at least from the 13th century. Bote is the origination of Battle, although the family may have settled there post-dating the Conquest. This translated as &#x27;a wood in a wood&#x27; which may in contradistinction have meant a clearing. The name of Apsley adopted by the family derived from Thakenham, near Pulborough in east Sussex, which may have referred to apse - lea or a &#x27;church in a meadow&#x27;. The Bathurst estates were at Cirencester Park and Paulerspury, Northamptonshire, which Bathursts inherited before the park was laid out in the Cotswolds.

==History==
The title Earl Bathurst was created in 1772 for Allen Bathurst, 1st Baron Bathurst, a politician and an opponent of Sir Robert Walpole. Bathurst was known for his wit and learning, for his connections with poets and scholars of his time, and for the famous landscape garden he created at his seat, Cirencester House, in Gloucestershire. He was the son of Sir Benjamin Bathurst, Cofferer of the Household and Governor of the British East India Company, by his wife Frances, daughter of Sir Allen Apsley. He had previously been elevated to the Peerage of Great Britain sixty years before in 1712 as Baron Bathurst, of Battlesden in the County of Bedford. He married his cousin Catherine Apsley, daughter of his maternal uncle Sir Peter Apsley, in 1704.

He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the second Earl. He was a prominent lawyer and politician. In 1771, four years before the death of his father, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in his own right as Baron Apsley, in the County of Sussex. He then served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain until 1778 and later held office as Lord President of the Council. Bathurst constructed Apsley House in London, which later became the seat of the Dukes of Wellington. His eldest son Henry, the third Earl, was a noted politician. He served as President of the Board of Trade, as Foreign Secretary, as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies and as Lord President of the Council. He gave his name to Bathurst, the capital of The Gambia, now called Banjul; to the Australian town of Bathurst, the first inland city in the country; and to Bathurst Street, a major street in Toronto in Canada.

His eldest son, the fourth Earl, represented Weobley and Cirencester in the House of Commons as a Tory. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Weobly. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the sixth Earl. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Thomas Seymour Bathurst, third and youngest son of the third Earl. Lord Bathurst represented Cirencester in Parliament as a Conservative.

On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the seventh Earl. He was for some years the owner of the &quot;Morning Post&quot;. Lord Bathurst&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent Allen Bathurst, Lord Apsley, was Member of Parliament for Southampton and Bristol Central. In 1942 he was killed in the Second World War, predeceasing his father by one year. His wife Viola Bathurst, Lady Apsley, succeeded him as Member of Parliament for Bristol Central. Lord Bathurst was succeeded by his grandson, the eighth Earl, who held political office under Harold Macmillan as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1957 to 1961 and as Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1961 to 1962. the titles are held by his son, the ninth Earl, who succeeded in 2011.

Several other members of the family have also gained distinction. Admiral of the Fleet Sir Benjamin Bathurst, First Sea Lord between 1993 and 1995, is the grandson of the Honourable Benjamin Bathurst, Member of Parliament for Cirencester, third son of the sixth Earl. Benjamin Bathurst, younger son of the second Earl, was a diplomat best known for his sudden disappearance in 1809. The politician Charles Bathurst (who was born Charles Bragge and assumed the surname of Bathurst in 1804), was the son of Anne Bathurst, granddaughter of Sir Benjamin Bathurst, younger brother of the first Earl Bathurst. He was the great-grandfather of Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe.

The family seat is Cirencester House, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

<text>Earl of Mansfield, in the County of Nottingham, and Earl of Mansfield, in the County of Middlesex, are two titles in the Peerage of Great Britain that have been united under a single holder since 1843.

==History==
The titles Earl of Mansfield (in the County of Nottingham) and Earl of Mansfield (in the County of Middlesex) were created in 1776 and 1792, respectively, for the Scottish lawyer and judge William Murray, 1st Baron Mansfield, fourth son of David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont (see Viscount of Stormont for the earlier history of the family). He was Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench from 1756 to 1788. Murray had already been created Baron Mansfield, in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1756, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. The two earldoms were created with different remainders. The 1776 earldom was created with remainder to Louisa Murray (née Cathcart), Lady Stormont (daughter of Charles Schaw Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart), second wife of his nephew David Murray, 7th Viscount of Stormont, while the 1792 earldom (referring to a fictitious Mansfield in Middlesex to differentiate it from the first earldom) was created with remainder to his nephew Lord Stormont.

Lord Mansfield was childless and on his death in 1793, the barony became extinct. He was succeeded in the 1776 earldom according to the special remainder by his nephew&#x27;s wife Louisa, the second Countess, and in the 1792 earldom according to the special remainder by his nephew Lord Stormont, who became the second Earl. The latter was a noted politician in his own right and served as Lord Justice General, Secretary of State for the Northern Department and Lord President of the Council. He was succeeded by his and Louisa&#x27;s eldest son, the third Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire. On his death, the title passed to his son, the fourth Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was a Tory politician and served as a Lord of the Treasury from 1834 to 1835 in the first administration of Sir Robert Peel. In 1843, he succeeded his grandmother the second Countess of Mansfield (who had outlived her husband by forty-seven years) and became in addition the third Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation.

He was succeeded by his grandson, the fifth and fourth Earl. He was the eldest son of William David Murray, Viscount of Stormont. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth and fifth Earl. His son, the seventh and sixth Earl, represented Perth in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Perthshire. The eighth and seventh Earl of Mansfield held office in the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher as a Minister of State at the Scottish Office from 1979 to 1983, and at the Northern Ireland Office from 1983 to 1984.

The titles are presently held by his elder son, the ninth Earl of Mansfield of the 1792 creation and the eighth Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation. He is also the fifteenth Viscount of Stormont, the fifteenth Lord Scone and the thirteenth Lord Balvaird.

The family seat is Scone Palace, near Scone, Perthshire. The Earl of Mansfield is the Hereditary Keeper of Bruce&#x27;s Castle of Lochmaben. The family also owned Kenwood House in London from 1754 to 1925.

<text>Earl of Mount Edgcumbe is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1789 for George Edgcumbe, 3rd Baron Edgcumbe. This branch of the Edgcumbe family descends from Sir Piers Edgcumbe of Cotehele in Cornwall (descended from the younger son of Richard Edgcumbe (fl. 1324) of Edgcumbe in the parish of Milton Abbot in Devon), who acquired an estate near Plymouth through marriage in the early 16th century, which was later re-named &quot;Mount Edgcumbe&quot; (a common tradition shared by several estates particularly on the south coast of Devon, for example Mount Tavy, Mount Radford, Mount Boone, Mount Gold (Plymouth), Mount Wise, etc.). His descendant Richard Edgcumbe was a prominent politician and served as Paymaster-General of Ireland and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In 1742, he was created Baron Edgcumbe, of Mount Edgcumbe in the County of Devon, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Richard Edgcumbe was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He represented Plympton Erle, Lostwithiel and Penrhyn in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Cornwall. On his death, the title passed to his younger brother, the third Baron. He was an Admiral of the Blue and also held political office as Treasurer of the Household and as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners. In 1781, he was created Viscount Mount Edgcumbe and Valletort and in 1789 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Mount Edgcumbe. Both titles are in the Peerage of Great Britain.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Lostwithiel and Fowey and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Cornwall. On his death the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, Viscount Valletort&#x27;s brother, the third Earl. He also represented Lostwithiel and Fowey in the House of Commons. His son, the fourth Earl, was a Conservative politician and served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Lord Steward of the Household. On his death the titles passed to his son, the fifth Earl. He held the honorary post of Deputy Lord Warden of the Stannaries from 1913 to 1944. On his death the line of the third Earl failed. The late Earl was succeeded by his second cousin, the sixth Earl. He was the grandson of George Edgcumbe, youngest son of the second Earl. He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the seventh Earl. He was the grandson of Edward Mortimer Edgcumbe, second son of George Edgcumbe, youngest son of the second Earl. the titles are held by his nephew, the ninth Earl Christopher Mortimer Edgcumbe, who succeeded his brother in that year. He is the third son of George Aubrey Valletort Edgcumbe, brother of the seventh Earl. 

The heir apparent Douglas George Valletort Edgcumbe to the earldom uses the honorary title of &quot;Viscount Valletort&quot;.

The present family seat is Empacombe House, near Cremyll, Cornwall. The ancestral seat of the Edgcumbe family is Mount Edgcumbe House, on the Rame Peninsula (Cornwall).

<text>Earl Fortescue is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was created in 1789 for Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Baron Fortescue (1753–1841), a member of parliament for Beaumaris and Lord-Lieutenant of Devon.

==History==
The Earls Fortescue descend from Sir Hugh Fortescue (1665–1719) of Filleigh and of Weare Giffard, both in Devon, whose first wife&#x27;s first cousin had been 13th Baron Clinton and 5th Earl of Lincoln. In 1721 the abeyance of the ancient barony of Clinton was terminated in favour of his son Hugh Fortescue (1696–1751), who thus became the 14th Baron Clinton. On 5 July 1746, he was created Earl Clinton, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body and Baron Fortescue, of Castle Hill in the County of Devon, with special remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to his half-brother Matthew Fortescue. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain.

Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Clinton (1696–1751), had no legitimate children and thus on his death the barony of Clinton fell into abeyance (see Baron Clinton for later history of this title) while the earldom of Clinton became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of Fortescue (according to the special remainder) by his half-brother Matthew Fortescue, 2nd Baron Fortescue.

Matthew&#x27;s son Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Baron Fortescue (1753–1841), was a member of parliament for Beaumaris and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Devon. In 1789 he was created Viscount Ebrington, of Ebrington in the County of Gloucester, and Earl Fortescue, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He married Hester Grenville, a daughter of Prime Minister George Grenville.

He was succeeded by his eldest son Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (1783–1861), who was a prominent Whig politician. After representing several constituencies in the House of Commons he was summoned in 1839 to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Fortescue. He then served under Lord Melbourne as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1839 to 1841 and under Lord John Russell as Lord Steward of the Household from 1846 to 1850. His son Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Earl Fortescue (1818–1905), was also a Whig politician and held minor office from 1846 to 1851 in the same government as his father. In 1859 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Fortescue. His eldest son Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue (1854–1932), sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Tiverton and for Tavistock. He also held the honorary position of Lord-Lieutenant of Devon. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue (1888–1958), a Conservative politician who served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (Chief Government Whip in the House of Lords) in 1945 and from 1951 to 1958. He died without surviving male issue and (having bequeathed the two principle ancestral seats of Castle Hill, Filleigh, and Weare Giffard Hall, to his two daughters), was succeeded in the earldom by his third and youngest brother Denzil Fortescue, 6th Earl Fortescue (1893–1977), who inherited the ancient Fortescue seat of Ebrington Manor in Gloucestersire. He was succeeded by his eldest son Richard Fortescue, 7th Earl Fortescue (1922–1993), who was succeeded by his eldest son Charles Fortescue, 8th Earl Fortescue (born 1951), living in 2015.

Several other members of the Fortescue family may also be mentioned. The Hon. George Fortescue, second son of the first Earl, was Member of Parliament for Hindon. The Hon. John Fortescue, second son of the second Earl, was Member of Parliament for Barnstaple. The Hon. Dudley Fortescue, third son of the second Earl, was Member of Parliament for Andover. The Hon. Sir Seymour John Fortescue (1856–1942), second son of the third Earl, was a captain in the Royal Navy and also served as Serjeant at Arms in the House of Lords. The Hon. Arthur Grenville Fortescue (1858–1895), fourth son of the third Earl, was a captain in the army and the grandfather of Arthur Henry Grenville Fortescue, a brigadier in the army. The Hon. Sir John William Fortescue, fifth son of the third Earl, was a major in the army and writer on the British Army. The Hon. Charles Grenville Fortescue (1861–1951), sixth son of the third Earl, was a brigadier-general in the army.

==Seats==
The principal seat of the present Earl Fortescue is Ebrington Manor, near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, purchased by his distant ancestor Sir John Fortescue (c.1394-1479), Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, a younger grandson of the Fortescue family of Whympston in the parish of Modbury in Devon, the earliest Fortescue seat in England. The more grandiose former seat Castle Hill, Filleigh, North Devon, rebuilt as a Palladian mansion by Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Clinton (1696–1751), has been since the death of the 5th Earl in 1958, the property and residence of descendants in the female line. Other historic Devon seats of branches of the Fortescue family were: Whympston in the parish of Modbury; Weare Giffard; Buckland Filleigh; Preston; Spriddlestone in the parish of Brixton and Fallapit in the parish of East Allington, all in Devon.

<text>Earl of Carnarvon is a title that has been created three times in British history. The current holder is George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon. The town and county in Wales to which the title refers are historically spelled Caernarfon, having been Anglicised to Carnarvon or Caernarvon. The traditional Welsh spelling is itself a modified form of the original name of antiquity, Caer-yn-Arfon, meaning fortification opposite the island of Mona (now called Ynys Môn, or Anglesey in English).

==History==
The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1628 in favour of Robert Dormer, 2nd Baron Dormer of Wyng. For more information on this creation, which became extinct in 1709, see the Baron Dormer.

The second creation was in 1714 in the Peerage of Great Britain for James Brydges, 9th Baron Chandos. In 1719 he was further honoured when he was made &quot;Marquess of Carnarvon&quot; and &quot;Duke of Chandos&quot;. For more information on this creation, which became extinct in 1789, see the Duke of Chandos.

The third creation was in 1793 in the Peerage of Great Britain for Henry Herbert, 1st Baron Porchester. The precise form of this creation was &quot;Earl of the Town and County of Carnarvon&quot;, in the Principality of Wales, although in practice only the style of &quot;Earl of Carnarvon&quot; is used. He had previously represented Wilton in the House of Commons and had already in 1780 been created &quot;Baron Porchester&quot;, of High Clere in the County of Southampton (also in the Peerage of Great Britain). Herbert was the son of Major-General the Hon. William Herbert, fifth son of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke. He was succeeded by his eldest son Henry George Herbert, the second Earl, who sat as Whig Member of Parliament for Cricklade.

His eldest son Henry John George Herbert, the third Earl, briefly represented Wootton Bassett in Parliament as a Tory before he succeeded his father in the earldom. His eldest son Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert, the fourth Earl, was a prominent Conservative politician and served as Secretary of State for the Colonies and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was succeeded by his only son from his first marriage, George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, who is noted for discovering the tomb of Tutankhamun along with Howard Carter.

, the titles are held by the fifth earl&#x27;s great-grandson, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 2001. 

Several other members of this branch of the Herbert family may be mentioned. The Very Reverend the Hon. William Herbert, third son of the first Earl, was a clergyman and noted botanist. His son Henry William Herbert was a novelist and writer on sport. Sir Robert George Wyndham Herbert, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1871 to 1892, was the son of the Hon. Algernon Herbert, fifth son of the first Earl.

The Hon. Auberon Herbert, second son of the third Earl, was a writer, theorist, and philosopher, and also represented Nottingham in the House of Commons. He married Lady Florence Amabel Cowper, daughter of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper and his wife Lady Anne Florence de Grey Cowper, 7th Baroness Lucas of Crudwell. In 1905, their only son Auberon Herbert succeeded his uncle as ninth Baron Lucas of Crudwell (see this title for further history of this branch of the family).

The Hon. Aubrey Herbert, second son of the fourth Earl, was Member of Parliament for South Somerset and for Yeovil. His son Auberon Herbert was an expert on Eastern Europe. His daughter Laura Herbert was the second wife of the novelist Evelyn Waugh and mother of the journalist Auberon Waugh.

The family seat of the Herbert Earls of Carnarvon is Highclere Castle in Hampshire, which was the filming location for the UK television series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. The traditional burial place of the Herbert Earls of Carnarvon is the Carnarvon Mausoleum, located in the park at Highclere Castle; some other family members are buried in the Herbert Mausoleum at the Church of All Saints, Burghclere.

<doc id="456998" wikidata="Q5138336" url="?curid=456998" title="Coastal Zone Management Act">
<text>The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA; , , Chapter 33) is an Act of Congress passed in 1972 to encourage coastal states to develop and implement coastal zone management plans (CZMPs). This act was established as a United States National policy to preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, restore or enhance, the resources of the Nation&#x27;s coastal zone for this and succeeding generations.

Importantly, Alaska withdrew from participation in the National Coastal Management Program in 2011. Also, while the Deepwater Port Act requires a state to have, or be making progress toward a federally approved coastal management program in order to issue a license for a facility in adjacent federal waters, it does not apply to offshore oil and gas extraction.

==History==

The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972 showed that the United States Congress &quot;recognized the importance of meeting the challenge of continued growth in the coastal zone&quot;. Under this act two national programs were created, the National Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. Out of 35 eligible states, only 34 have established management programs; Washington State was the first state to adopt the program in 1976.

The Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP), also called the National Coastal Zone Management Program, was established under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 and is administered by NOAA’s Office for Coastal Management (OCM). This program is designed to set up a basis for protecting, restoring, and establishing a responsibility in preserving and developing the nation’s coastal communities and resources, where they are under the highest pressure. The vision of the CZMP is to ensure that “the nation’s coast and oceans, including the Great Lakes and island territories, are healthy and thriving for this and future generation”. Their mission is “to ensure the conservation and responsible use of our nation’s coastal and ocean resources”.

The key goals of the National CZM program include: “protecting natural resources, managing development in high hazard areas, giving development priority to coastal-dependent uses, providing public access for recreation, coordinating state and federal actions”. Ultimately the outcomes from the CZMP are for “healthy and productive coastal ecosystems, and to have environmentally, economically, and socially vibrant and resilient coastal communities”.

The National Estuarine Research Reserve System is the second program established by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 and is also administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NERRS is a network of 30 areas within the nation and various coastal states, which spans more than 1 million acres. These areas are used for long-term research, water-quality monitoring, education, and coastal stewardship.

==Components==

Title 16 Chapter 33- Coastal Zone Management Act
* 16 U.S.C. § 1451. Congressional findings
Congress found a national interest for the management protection and use of coastal zones. Coastal zones are valuable to the nation&#x27;s current and future prosperity for their &quot;natural, commercial, recreational, ecological, industrial, and esthetic resources.&quot; Many stresses are on the lands of coastal zone, from natural, residential, and industry and there is need to preserve and protect these areas. Some of the ecosystems are threatened by man, if lands aren’t preserved and protected all beneficial use can be lost forever. “In light of competing demands and the urgent need to protect and to give high priority to natural systems in the coastal zone…” Also, due to potential for global warming these areas need to be prepared for any alterations in water levels.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1452. Congressional declaration of policy
Congress declares in its national policy “to preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance, the resources of the Nation&#x27;s coastal zone for this and succeeding generations.” This is encouraged through the various states and coastal regions that want to actively participate in local, Federal, and State programs. These programs need to be aware of changes affecting the coastal areas and know how to act in response.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1453. Definitions
A “coastal zone&quot; is defined as the “coastal waters and the adjacent shorelands, as well as includes islands, transitional and intertidal areas, salt marshes, wetlands, and beaches.” 

* 16 U.S.C. § 1454. Management program development grants
These are awarded to coastal states that have developed a management program which has been approved through the Secretary.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1455. Administrative grants
Funds will be awarded through the Secretary to coastal states that establish management programs. States must identify clear boundaries for the coastal zone they wish to monitor and preserve, as well as define the lands subject to management. The State will conduct public hearings for the development of the program. The Governor of the State must also review and approve any changes to the program. Also the State has to ensure a method of regulation for local land and water usage within the defined areas.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1455a. Coastal resource improvement program
The Secretary can award grants to a coastal state to help that state meet such requirement as the preservation or restoration of areas designated under the program or that have coastal resources of national significance. This also means to establish public beaches as well as more public coastal regions and waters. Funding can be used to acquire more lands, and low-cost construction such as fences, parks, and paths.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1455b. Protecting coastal waters
Programs established, or applying for establishment, must give a general purpose for the land uses of the coastal zone. The state must include the critical coastal areas of the set region, establish management procedures, and technical assistance resources. The state needs to identify how it will be engaging public participation, for a community effort, this includes public hearings and the right for public education. States will demonstrate how they will establish coordination amongst local government bodies, state, and federal, and as how the potential boundary modification of the zone will affect the program.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1456. Coordination and cooperation
If other Federal agencies are interested in the program, the Secretary is responsible for coordination of their set activities with this body.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1456-1. Authorization of the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program
Under the Coastal Zone Management Program and the National Estuarine Reserve System, appropriate cooperation with local agencies, State and other agency will provide the means for protecting these zones. This is to preserve areas that have importance regarding “recreation, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values, or that are threatened by conversion from their natural, undeveloped, or recreational state.” The National Ocean Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management will administer the programs

* 16 U.S.C. § 1456a. Coastal Zone Management Fund
* 16 U.S.C. § 1456b. Coastal Zone Enhancement Grants
Grants will be subject to the limitations of the goals of coastal zone enhancement objectives. This means that the state will aim toward either the protection, restoration or the enhancement of the coastal zone or for the creation of new wetlands. This also includes, protecting and reducing threats to the environment and managing potential hazards; the areas should include public access venues pertaining to aesthetic, historical, or cultural value; and management and prevention of debris.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1456c. Technical assistance
A network will be established by the Secretary to support the development and implementation of the coastal management program into the State.
* 16 U.S.C. § 1457. Public hearings
Hearings will be announced 30 days in advance and will provide documentation of studies and data available for public viewing. This is similar to the effect as documentation of data will be available for public viewing as the agency becomes aware of it.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1458. Review of performance
* 16 U.S.C. § 1459. Records and audit
* 16 U.S.C. § 1460. Walter B. Jones Excellence in Coastal Zone Management Awards
* 16 U.S.C. § 1461. National Estuarine Research Reserve System
* 16 U.S.C. § 1462. Coastal Zone Management Reports
* 16 U.S.C. § 1463. Rules and Regulations
The Secretary will develop and rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter, this is subject to influences of local, state, and federal agencies, as to include port authorities and those others interested.

* 16 U.S.C. § 1464. Authorization of appropriations
* 16 U.S.C. § 1465. Appeals to the Secretary

==Budget==
The Office for Coastal Management (OCM) awards four types of funding to the National CZMP. Combined, the 2011 award totaled over $65 million which supports a &quot;variety of coastal management projects.&quot;

===Coastal Zone Management Program===
The four types of funding relevant to the Coastal Zone Management Programs are:

1. Administrative Grants 
OCM provides matching funds to states for CZMP (1:1).

2. Coastal Resource Improvement Program States may spend half of their Section 306 funds on small-scale construction or land acquisition projects, this is geared to improve “public access to the coast, facilitate redevelopment of urban waterfronts, or preserve and restore coastal resources.” 

3. Coastal Zone Enhancement Grants
Per Section 309, OCM provides zero match funds to state coastal zone management programs, beneficial for enhancement of the states program

4. Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (Technical Assistance)
Congress matches funds to that of the States established program (1:1).

===National Estuarine Reserve System===
Under Section 315, the OCM provides funding to the 28 state National Estuarine Research Reserves. Funding is used for support of research, land acquisition matched (1:1), construction, education, monitoring, and graduate research fellowships.

==Coastal Zone Management Program==

A former participant is Alaska. The state withdrew from participation in the National Coastal Management Program on July 1, 2011. Also, while the Deepwater Port Act requires a state to have, or be making progress toward a federally approved coastal management program in order to issue a license for a facility in adjacent federal waters, it does not apply to offshore oil and gas extraction.

<text>Tesfaye Gebre Kidan Geletu (, – 4 June 2004) was an Ethiopian general who was the acting president of Ethiopia for one week in late May 1991.

==Biography==
===Military career===
Prior to joining the Holetta Military Academy, Tesfaye took a one year teacher training course to become an elementary school teacher. After completing his training, he was assigned to Gamo Gofa province. Because of little pay and bad living conditions, he left his teaching job to join the Holetta Military Academy.

At the academy he met Mengistu Haile Mariam; according to Gebru Tareke, along with Legesse Asfaw and Gebreyes Wolde Hana Tesfaye was part of Mengistu&#x27;s inner circle, his &quot;pals Mengistu knew more intimately in less pressing times, men who played and drank with him and stood by him during the bloody factional days of the Derg.&quot; While a colonel, Tesfaye was a member of the Derg, the military committee which seized power from Emperor Haile Selassie, and which would later order the executions of his officials and allegedly the murder of the deposed emperor himself. He had military successes in Somalia and Eritrea, notably as commander of the forces around Jijiga during the Ogaden War.

Elevated to the rank of Lt. General, Tesfaye Gebre Kidan went on to serve as the longtime minister of defence, then on 14 May 1988 was made military governor and general commander in Eritrea. He was recalled to Addis Ababa from Asmara to serve on the military tribunal, which tried the high-ranking officers who had tried to depose President Mengistu in 1989 following the decisive defeat at the Battle of Shire.

===Vice President of Ethiopia===
He was appointed as Vice President of Ethiopia in April 1991. He became acting president on 21 May 1991 when Mengistu fled as Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) forces closed in on the capital.

Tesfaye took over a regime in a state of utter collapse. He only ruled for a week before the EPRDF marched into Addis Ababa and seized power on 27 May 1991. &quot;Government troops turned on one another,&quot; read one contemporary account. &quot;Soldiers wantonly looted state property.&quot; Tesfaye realized almost as soon as he took power that he was in an untenable position. With the EPRDF closing in on Addis Ababa from all sides, Tesfaye informed the U.S. chargé d&#x27;affaires in Addis Ababa that he could no longer control the situation and had lost command of what was left of the army. After announcing a unilateral cease-fire he fled for the safety of the Italian Embassy. According to Paul B. Henze, Tesfaye had first sought sanctuary at the US embassy, but Ambassador Robert Houdek turned him away.

===Asylum in the Italian Embassy===
The General remained a virtual prisoner in the embassy. He suffered a stroke while at the embassy, and as a result used a wheelchair to move around.

===Death===
Tesfaye&#x27;s death was publicly confirmed on 4 June 2004.

It is rumored that he died after being hit over the head with a bottle during a physical brawl with Berhanu. CNN later reported that a source confirmed that Berhanu was not involved in the death.

In the book &quot;I noti ospiti&quot;, a waiter claimed that on June 2, 2004, Tesfaye was struck on the head with a bottle by his fellow refugee (and former foreign minister) Berhanu Bayeh, causing him to bleed. He was taken to Menelik II Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

<text>The National System of Marine Protected Areas of the United States is a national initiative designed to strengthen the protection of U.S. ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources through the coordination of existing marine protected areas (MPAs). The national system of MPAs consists of the group of MPA sites, networks, and systems established and managed by federal, state, territorial, tribal and/or local governments that collectively enhance conservation of the nation&#x27;s marine heritage and represent its diverse ecosystems and resources. Although managed independently, national system MPAs work together at the regional and national levels to achieve common objectives for conserving the nation&#x27;s important natural and cultural resources. The national system does not bring state, territorial or local sites under federal authority, nor does it restrict or change the management of any MPA.

==History==
In 1981 Olympic National Park became a marine protected area. The total protected area is . 173.2 km2 of the area was an MPA.

President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 13158 in May 2000 for “strengthening the management, protection, and conservation of existing marine protected areas (MPA) and establishment of new or expanded MPAs; the development of a scientifically based, comprehensive national system of MPAs representing diverse U.S. marine ecosystems and the Nation&#x27;s natural and cultural resources; and the avoiding causing harm to MPAs through federally conducted, approved, or funded activities.”

President George W. Bush issued Presidential proclamation 8031 on June 15, 2006 establishing Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.

In April 2009, the US established a United States National System of Marine Protected Areas to strengthen the protection of US ocean, coastal and Great Lakes resources. These large-scale MPAs attempted to balance &quot;the interests of conservationists, fishers, and the public.&quot; As of 2009, 225 MPAs participated in the national system. Sites work together toward common national and regional conservation goals and priorities. NOAA&#x27;s national marine protected areas center maintains a comprehensive inventory of all 1,600+ MPAs within the US exclusive economic zone. Most US MPAs.allow some type of extractive use. Fewer than 1% of U.S. waters prohibit all extractive activities.

President Barack Obama signed a proclamation on September 25, 2014, expanding the existing Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, one of the world&#x27;s most pristine tropical marine environments, to six times its current size, encompassing of protected area around these islands. Expanding the Monument protected the area&#x27;s unique deep coral reefs and seamounts. In 2016 he expanded Papahānaumokuākea to encompass the entire Exclusive Economic Zone, covering .

=== California ===

In 1999, California adopted the Marine Life Protection Act, the first state law requiring a comprehensive, science-based MPA network. The state created the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. MLPA established a plan to create California&#x27;s statewide MPA network by 2011. The Central Coast step was completed in September, 2007. The North Central Coast step was completed in 2010. The South Coast and North Coast steps were expected to go into effect in 2012.

==Background==
MPAs have been created by a mix of federal, state, and local legislation, voter initiatives, and regulations, each established for its own specific purpose. As a result, the nation&#x27;s collection of MPAs (e.g., reserves, refuges, preserves, sanctuaries, areas of special biological significance, and others) is fragmented, complex, confusing, and potentially missing opportunities for broader regional conservation through coordinated planning and management. In 2000, a broad coalition of scientists petitioned the White House to create a national system of MPAs to improve conservation of the nation&#x27;s marine ecosystems, cultural resources, and fisheries. Presidential Executive Order 13158 was signed by President Bill Clinton on May 26, 2000, directing the Department of Commerce to work with the Department of the Interior, other federal agencies, states, territories, tribes and stakeholders to establish a national system of MPAs to integrate and enhance the nation&#x27;s MPAs, bringing these diverse sites and programs together to work on common conservation objectives.

MPAs protect ecosystems and resources such as coral reefs, kelp forests, shipwrecks, and those areas frequented by whales and other marine life. They also can provide protection to economically valuable coastal and marine resources including commercial and recreational fisheries. The national system includes MPAs throughout the marine environment of the U.S. and its territories, including coastal areas, estuaries, oceans and the Great Lakes. As a first step in developing the national system of MPAs, the MPA Center compiled an MPA Inventory of all MPAs in U.S. waters. The U.S. has over 1,600 MPAs, ranging from typically small fully protected marine reserves where extractive uses are prohibited to large, multiple-use areas where fishing, diving and other uses are permitted. Most MPAs in U.S. waters allow some type of extractive use, with less than 1% of U.S. waters fully protected marine reserves where extractive activities are not permitted.

The national system is described in detail in the for a National System of Marine Protected Areas of the United States of America&quot;.

In April 2009 the National System of Marine Protected Areas was officially established with the acceptance of the first 225 charter sites. A second nomination process was held in the fall of 2009, and additional sites will be admitted to the system in 2010 on an annual basis thereafter. The nomination process is transparent, science-based, and provides an opportunity for public comment.

The national system of MPAs provides the first comprehensive mechanism for coordinating MPAs managed by diverse federal, state, territorial, tribal and local agencies to work toward national conservation objectives. The system will benefit the nation&#x27;s collective conservation efforts and participating MPAs, providing those sites with a means to address issues beyond their boundaries. Examples of some of these benefits include:
*Enhanced stewardship through better coordination, public awareness and enhanced site management capacity 
*Building partnerships for MPAs to work together toward common conservation objectives 
*Increased support for marine conservation through the recognition provided by the national system 
*Protecting representative ecosystems and resources from all the nation&#x27;s ecosystem and habitat types 
*Identifying gaps in current protection of ocean resources to help inform future MPA planning 
*Transparent process for MPA planning that is science-*based and includes a &quot;commitment&quot; to balanced stakeholder involvement.

<text>Swansea is a neighbourhood in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, bounded on the west by the Humber River, on the north by Bloor Street, on the east by High Park and on the south by Lake Ontario. The neighbourhood was originally a separate municipality, the Village of Swansea, which became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953.

Swansea is represented by Ward 4 Parkdale—High Park along with the federal and provincial ridings of Parkdale—High Park and the postal code is M6S. It is patrolled by the 13 Division of the Toronto Police Service.

==Character==
Swansea is primarily residential in nature, consisting of a mix of various housing types. Swansea&#x27;s high-end homes are located either at the western edge of High Park overlooking Grenadier Pond, or on Riverside Drive and the Brule Gardens enclave bordering the Humber River. Swansea also contains a large number of semi-detached houses and bungalows located mostly in the centre of the neighbourhood. The typical house of the area was built between 1905 and 1935.

The area of the former Swansea Works is considerably newer, except for some of the original workers&#x27; homes. The Queensway was built in the 1950s through the Swansea Works lands. The area to the south was retained for industry and the area to the north was redeveloped with apartment buildings and townhome developments. The area of the actual factory site has been redeveloped since 2000 into townhomes and condominium apartments.

Swansea has several main streets. Along the northern boundary, Bloor Street is a four-lane arterial road with businesses lining both sides. Along the southern boundary, The Queensway is a four-lane arterial road with a streetcar right-of-way. The Queensway has primarily residences on both sides. North-south, Swansea has two major roads, South Kingsway and Windermere Avenue. Along the southern boundary is the Gardiner Expressway which has an interchange with South Kingsway and the CNR railway lines. Further to the south, Lake Shore Boulevard runs east–west parallel to the lake shore.

The area is hilly in nature. The waters of Grenadier Pond, Rennie Pond, and the Humber River all are at or near the level of Lake Ontario. The majority of the lands of &#x27;upper&#x27; Swansea are higher than this, with steep hillsides along Grenadier Pond, Humber River, and Rennie Pond.

==History==

The nearby mouth of the Humber River was the southern terminus of the route First Nations people used to travel from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron, and the other upper lakes. It is at this spot between 1615 and 1618 that it is believed that Étienne Brûlé was the first European to view Lake Ontario, with his party of indigenous and French explorers. The foot of the Humber was also the site of a French fur trading post.

When the fall of the French Regime came in 1760, Jean-Bonaventure Rousseau, a fur trader, of French descent, was trading furs at the mouth of the Humber River. The British Quebec government granted Rousseau a license to continue his trading in 1770. In the late 1780s, his son Jean Baptiste Rousseau began developing a parcel of 500 acres around the trading post. Rousseau was living at his &#x27;Rousseau House&#x27; when Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe arrived with the first English settlers for the new settlement of York and Rousseau guided the new governor&#x27;s ship into Toronto Bay (now Toronto&#x27;s harbour). When York was first surveyed, the entire area along the Humber River was designated as a Mill Reserve (forest to be left intact for the use of the King&#x27;s Sawmill. Rousseau refused an offer to relocate across the river to Etobicoke and left the area. Rousseau moved his main area of development to Ancaster, Ontario in 1795. The site of &#x27;Rousseau House&#x27; is today marked by a plaque.

By the 1880s, the mill reserve in Swansea was still unused and the area was subdivided into &#x27;wood lots&#x27; (sections of forest to be sold to families living further away for use as timber fuel).

Through the 19th century the area later known as Swansea was divided between two farm lots:

The western half of Swansea became surveyed as lots 39 and 40. The lots were laid out south of Bloor Street, lot 1 starting to the east, and the numbers increasing in the western direction. Lot 40 was directly south-east of Jane Street extending east to where Windermere Avenue intersects Bloor Street. Lot 39, the next to the east saw the first development, on property owned by Mark Coe. By 1884, along Bloor Street, several blocks were subdivided as far south as today&#x27;s Morningside Avenue, then known as Grenadier Road, and as far east as today&#x27;s Kennedy Avenue. These are the only streets in Swansea laid out on a grid pattern, possibly because this section is relatively flat.

The eastern half of what is now Swansea was a forested lot purchased in 1838 by early Toronto artist, philanthropist and architect John Ellis whose home, &#x27;Herne Hill&#x27;, stood on Grenadier Heights overlooking Grenadier Pond. The north–south street that connects to Grenadier Heights was named &#x27;Ellis&#x27; in honour of Swansea&#x27;s first family. Despite the building of a railway along the south of his estate in the 1850s, Mr Ellis did not develop his lot. With the death of John Ellis&#x27; widow in 1884, the Ellis estate became the property of John Ellis Jr. who sold off the land to the north of Herne Hill. The house itself was demolished in 1925. of former Ellis lands on the east side of Grenadier Pond were bought by Toronto and merged with High Park in 1930.

===Windermere &amp; Swansea===
By the 1880s, the area south of Bloor was known as &#x27;Windermere&#x27; after England&#x27;s Lake District which it is said to have resembled. To the south, industry developed on Coe&#x27;s land along the railway line, including the Ontario Bolt Works, just east of the Humber, which replaced a factory on the site of today&#x27;s streetcar yards at Roncesvalles. Built in 1882, its cornerstone laying attended by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, the factory lands extended north to today&#x27;s Morningside Avenue. In 1889, the factory was bought by James Worthington and the name changed to Swansea Works, Worthington himself being from the Swansea area of Wales. The factory became the major employer in the area with subsidiary industrial lands to the north of today&#x27;s The Queensway. A settlement of workers&#x27; cottages built by Worthington dating from the 1880s grew around the plant. The factory, burnt down in 1906 and rebuilt, became part of Stelco in 1910, and it remained in operation until 1989.

In the centre of Swansea were several elongated ponds running north–south. The largest, Catfish Pond, is the only one that has survived. Some of the ponds were filled in for the railway line and industrial area. One of the ponds on the former Coe property, on the site of today&#x27;s Swansea Mews public housing project, was turned into a dump and filled in with tailings.

By 1890, the area was known as Swansea, with a train stop on the Great Western at Windermere. The post office was in the Works building, and church services were also held there. Worthington promoted the community, giving land for Swansea Public School in 1890 and the mission church. Worthington&#x27;s ownership of the Bolt Works ended not long afterward, and the Works was eventually absorbed into Stelco in 1910.

===Village of Swansea===
In 1926, Swansea separated from York Township and incorporated as a village. The largely forested village saw the building of many upper-middle-class homes on the former Ellis estate as a quiet &#x27;leafy&#x27; neighbourhood developed.

The Swansea Village corporate seal reveals a great deal about the colourful history of the neighbourhood. Included on the Swansea seal is explorer Étienne Brûlé, who in 1615 became the first European to set foot on what is now Swansea and also shown is a First Nations member. This is symbolic in that it recognizes that First Nations members were the first people to inhabit Swansea, thousands of years ago. The hills in the Swansea Village seal represent Swansea&#x27;s rolling countryside. The water in the Swansea seal refers to Swansea&#x27;s natural boundaries, which include Lake Ontario, the Humber River and Grenadier Pond.

===Joining Metropolitan Toronto===
In 1967, the Village of Swansea became part of Metropolitan Toronto. With the extension of Toronto&#x27;s Queen Street and Queen streetcar line as &#x27;The Queensway&#x27; following the southern limits of the village, Swansea quickly urbanised with many apartment buildings being built in the western half of the area.
The small strip of industrial land housing the former wire works between The Queensway and Lake Shore Boulevard has been largely redeveloped as a high-density residential mix of towers and townhouses.

==Demographics==

Census tracts 0050.01 and 0050.02 of the 2006 Canadian census cover Swansea. According to that census, the neighborhood has 11,133 residents, up 0.5% since the 2001 census. Average income is $58,681, well above the Toronto average. Like much of West Toronto, the largest ethnic minorities are Eastern European. The ten most common languages in the neighbourhood, after English, are:

# Polish: 3.0%
# Ukrainian: 2.6%
# Serbian: 2.3%
# Russian: 2.2%
# French: 0.9%
# Portuguese: 0.9%
# Spanish: 0.8%
# Bengali: 0.7%
# Croatian: 0.7%
# Korean: 0.6%

==Recreation==

The former Swansea Town Hall is now the Swansea Town Hall Community Centre which includes a selection of meeting rooms available for a variety of functions. It is also the home of the Swansea Memorial Public Library, the second smallest branch of the Toronto Public Library system. This branch specializes in material for children and seniors and provides complete inter-library loan services.

===Parks===
Rennie Park, located on the east side of Rennie Terrace, south of Morningside Avenue, has four tennis courts, an artificial ice rink, and a wading pool. Swansea Recreational Centre, a part of Swansea Public School, has a gym and a swimming pool. High Park features a full day of recreational activities including fishing, theatre performances, train rides, an animal zoo, historical exhibits, a restaurant and a myriad of fitness opportunities.

==Reeves of the Village of Swansea==
The village reeve was the head of the village council and the equivalent of a mayor. Swansea had its own reeve from its attainment of village status in 1926 until its dissolution on December 31, 1966.

==Prominent residents==
* Lucy Maud Montgomery - writer of the Anne of Green Gables series of books, lived in a home at 210 Riverside Drive from 1935 to 1942. A small park named after Montgomery is located on Riverside Drive, between Riverside Trail and Riverside Crescent.
* Rita Cox - librarian and storyteller who spent most of her career as the head of the Parkdale branch of Toronto Public Library. She was identified as living in Swansea in 2010.

<doc id="457013" wikidata="Q1935821" url="?curid=457013" title="Subaru Vivio">
<text>The Subaru Vivio is a kei car that was introduced in March 1992, and manufactured by Subaru until October 1998. It is small enough to place it in the kei car class, giving its owners large tax breaks in Japan. The Vivio has a spacious interior considering its small size, thanks to a relatively tall profile and large windows. The name &quot;Vivio&quot; is a reference to the engine&#x27;s displacement of 660 written in an approximation of Roman numerals (VI, VI, O), and also inspired by the word &quot;vivid&quot;. It replaced the Rex nameplate that was introduced in the 1970s, and was itself superseded by the Subaru Pleo. The Vivio was available in 3 and 5-door versions, with a two-door targa top version named &quot;T-top&quot; also available.

==Drivetrain==
The Vivio was available with a variety of 658 cc naturally aspirated or supercharged four-cylinder &quot;Clover&quot; engines with different gearbox options (including ECVT – an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission) and multiple trim packages. Aside from the top-of-the-line RX-R, all engines were SOHC 8-valve designs. The ECVT equipped supercharged model claimed with such a setup, and while the Twin Cam 16-valve RX-R version claimed to make no more power than the SOHC, this was only to stay within the limitations laid down by Japan&#x27;s kei car legislations. Claimed torque was higher, at versus . Front- or four-wheel drive versions were offered on most of the lineup.

The most common version of the Vivio has a multi-point fuel-injected EN07E engine. This produces in manual transmission cars, while ECVT cars have to make do with . DIN was claimed in Europe for the same engine. There was also a carbureted version with in Japan, which equipped the Vivio Van versions (two-seater and ef-s).

==History==
The Vivio was sold in many European markets, where it is unusual in not receiving a larger engine than in the home market. The preceding Subaru Rex, the Suzuki Alto, and the Daihatsu Cuore all utilized larger engines when sold in Europe, but the Vivio&#x27;s technical specifications were nearly identical to the Japanese Domestic Market version - including fuel injection, while its kei competitors still had carbureted engines in export trim.

In May 1993 the Vivio T-top arrived, available only for special order. Only 3,000 were released, to celebrate Subaru&#x27;s 40th anniversary, fitted with the fuel-injected EN07E engine and either a five-speed manual or the ECVT transmission. The T-top version was built by Takada Kogyo, a convertible specialist who also assembled Nissan&#x27;s Figaro and Silvia Varietta amongst other specialty cars. An additional 1,000 GX-T models were released in February 1994; these are fitted with the SOHC supercharged engine from the GX (EN07Z), only available coupled to the ECVT.

In November 1995 the &quot;Vivio Bistro&quot; was introduced. This was a modified version with a retro theme, with Mini-esque front and rear fascias, matching upholstery and modifications to the dashboard. The Bistro series became a hit, causing Subaru to release multiple succeeding versions of the Bistro, called the &quot;Bistro B-Custom&quot;, the &quot;Bistro Chiffon&quot;, the &quot;Bistro White Edition&quot;, the &quot;L Bistro&quot;, the &quot;Sports Bistro&quot; with BBS wheels, the &quot;Bistro SS&quot; using the engine package from the Vivio RX-SS, and the &quot;Club Bistro&quot; with a British black cab appearance. The trend of retro-styled cars was quite popular in 1990s Japan, following the success of Nissan&#x27;s &quot;Pike&quot; series cars like the Pao and Figaro. Subaru also tried this approach with the larger Subaru Impreza in a trim called the Casa Blanca with limited success.

The suspension setup used was inspired by the Legacy, a setup that avoided strictly using MacPherson struts to save on production costs.

==Motorsport==

The supercharged RX-R and RX-RA was widely used for rallying in Japan. RX-RA was a motorsports trim grade with closer ratio gearing and stiffer suspensions than RX-R. Some entrants still enter Vivios at WRC Rally Japan.

In 1992, at the Paris-Beijing marathon raid, a private entrant ran the Vivio RX-R with the EN07X engine. Most people who saw the car thought it wouldn&#x27;t last long, but it was faster than the Mitsubishi Pajero works team during the prologue stage, and ran for more than a week until it broke its suspension. The car made it to the finishing line unofficially after repairs were carried out, with no other serious troubles.

The most famous appearance of the Vivio in an international motorsport event was in the 1993 round of the Safari Rally under the control of former factory driver and Subaru Technica International founder and team owner Noriyuki Koseki to promote the car. He made the decision to enter three of the sports model &quot;Vivio Super KK&quot; driven by Masashi Ishida, local driver Patrick Njiru and up and coming WRC star Colin McRae in his Safari debut. &quot;Super KK&quot; is the FIA homologation name for the RX-R grade, and in rally trim the 658 cc engine produced at 6,000 rpm.

Only Njiru finished the race, achieving 12th place. McRae did manage to set the fastest stage time before going for two stages in Makindu before retiring with suspension failure on Special Stage 16. He later said &quot;You can hide the whole car in every single pothole along the route!&quot; Ishida had to retire with head gasket failure on Special Stage 45.

This appearance was satirized by cartoonist Jim Bamber for the Yumping Yarns cartoon of &quot;Car &amp; Car Conversions&quot; magazine, in which he depicted McRae driving his Vivio underneath an elephant.

<doc id="457014" wikidata="Q3365446" url="?curid=457014" title="Parkdale, Toronto">
<text>Parkdale is a neighbourhood and former village in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, west of downtown. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by Roncesvalles Avenue; on the north by the CP Rail line where it crosses Queen Street and Dundas Street; on the east by Dufferin Street from Queen Street south; and on the south by Lake Ontario. The original village incorporated an area north of Queen Street, east of Roncesvalles from Fermanagh east to the main rail lines, today known as part of the Roncesvalles neighbourhood. The village area was roughly one square kilometre in area. The City of Toronto government extends the neighbourhood boundaries to the east, south of the CP Rail lines, east to Atlantic Avenue, as far south as the CN Rail lines north of Exhibition Place, the part south of King Street commonly known as the western half of Liberty Village neighbourhood.

Parkdale was founded as an independent settlement within York County in the 1850s. It was incorporated as a village in 1879 and amalgamated with Toronto in 1889. It was an upper-income residential area for the first half of the 20th century, with several notable mansions. The area changed dramatically with the building of the Gardiner Expressway in 1955, which resulted in the demolition of the southern section of the neighbourhood and the Sunnyside Amusement Park, and the creation of a barrier between the neighbourhood and the north shore of Lake Ontario. A boom in apartment building construction followed, replacing whole blocks of homes with blocks of apartment buildings. Some of the older large residential buildings remain though many were converted into rooming houses. The demographic composition changed considerably, including a higher proportion of lower income and newcomer families. Today, it is a working-class neighbourhood, with a large percentage of low-income households concentrated in South Parkdale, and an entry point for new immigrants, most recently South Asians and Tibetan. The visible minority population in North Parkdale has changed overall to include fewer Asian, South Asian and Black residents between the census years 2006-2011 (GNR: 34%). The distribution of said visible minorities has changed from being predominantly Black visible minorities to predominantly South Asian (between 2006 and 2011 census).

The area has a vibrant storefront commercial strip along Queen Street West that has seen an increase in restaurants and bars in the 2010s, increasing to the point that planning controls were put in place on the opening of new restaurants and bars from 2012.
==Character==
Parkdale is primarily a residential area of the city, with semi-detached homes predominating on most side streets. Many of the homes date from the 19th Century and early 20th Century. Around 1900, the area was a well-to-do suburb and many older mansions from around 1900 still exist, often converted to multi-unit buildings. Many of the residential streets have mature trees. Good examples of Victorian housing can still be found on Cowan Avenue and Dunn Avenue, south of King Street. Victorian-era row homes of Georgian Revival style with original gaslights can also be seen on Melbourne Place.

Parkdale has a higher than average amount of rental housing. Several streets, notably Jameson Avenue and Tyndall Avenue have been converted to zones of apartment buildings. The apartment buildings mostly date from the 1950s through the 1970s, and have remained rental buildings while no large condominium projects have been built west of Dufferin Street.

Parkdale&#x27;s commercial districts are along Queen Street West from Roncesvalles in the west to Dufferin Avenue in the east, and King Street West around Dufferin Street. Queen Street West has a large proportion of restaurants and bars, as well as local shops and art galleries. Commercial space is mostly storefronts oriented toward local customers.

The area has a lower amount of park land per resident compared to other parts of Toronto. Several streets have &quot;parkettes&quot; (small parks) built since the 1960s in an initiative to increase the amount of park land in the area.

Demographically, Parkdale is mixed in income and ethnicity. The neighbourhood has an above average percentage of renters and that number has increased since 2006 to 2011. The area contains some of the lowest-income persons in the city. Between 2006 and 2011, there was a decrease in the median income of Parkdale by 2.9%. However, in 2011, there was an increase in the number of people earning within the range of $30,000 to $60,000. The large amount of rental stock is an entry point for immigrants to Toronto. The area has a significant group of musicians and visual artists, who often perform and exhibit locally.

To the south of Parkdale, the area is bordered by transportation uses, including the railway, Gardiner Expressway and Lake Shore Boulevard. South of the transportation corridor, the shoreline is mostly park land, with recreational clubs such as the Argonaut Rowing Club and Boulevard Club (formerly the Parkdale Canoe Club) on the water.

==History==
The Village of Parkdale was founded in 1879, but settlement of the area predated its foundation. In 1812, the of land bounded from Lot Street (today&#x27;s Queen Street) on the north, and Jameson on the west and Dufferin Avenue was granted to James Brock, the cousin of Sir Isaac Brock, in lieu of salary. Brock did not occupy or improve the land during his lifetime. After Brock&#x27;s death in 1830, his widow Lucy Brock sold the lands which became the major part of Parkdale to John Henry Dunn and William Gwynne. The area north of Queen Street was subdivided from the O&#x27;Hara Estate, given to Walter O&#x27;Hara for military service. Another parcel of land north of Queen was given to James Brock, east of the O&#x27;Hara estate, was developed along Brock Avenue and became Brockton Village.

The Parkdale railway station was opened at Queen and Dufferin streets in 1856. In the 1870s, the Grand Trunk Railway built a railway station at Jameson Avenue, on its east–west line. It was named South Parkdale, and the Queen Street station was given the name of North Parkdale station.

A census of residents prior to the founding showed 783 residents of the area, more than enough for the legal requirement of 750 at the time. A local legend is that Romani people (then called Gypsies) were signed up as local residents to provide enough numbers. Parkdale&#x27;s status as an independent village was controversial at the time and was opposed by the City of Toronto and the York County councils.

It was purely a residential suburb, home to large Victorian mansions and views of Lake Ontario. The first house of worship in Parkdale, the Anglican Church of St. Mark, was completed on January 20, 1881, on Cowan Ave just south of Queen Street. In 1884, the Village council passed a bylaw to join Toronto, to be &quot;annexed&quot; by the City of Toronto, as the village was in fact surrounded by the city of Toronto. The act did not take place immediately as the Village&#x27;s finances were not in order. Liabilities of the village were not clearly stated in the village&#x27;s financial statements. On October 27, 1888, another vote was held and the annexation was upheld. The village was annexed by the City of Toronto in March 1889. It became &quot;St. Alban&#x27;s Ward.&quot;.

In the 1910s, the South Parkdale station was closed and replaced with Sunnyside railway station. At the time, a cut was made between Dowling and Atlantic streets and the rail lines of the Grand Trunk were moved below street level. The North Parkdale stations were given new signage of &quot;Parkdale&quot;, returning to the original name.

===&#x27;Sunnyside years&#x27;===
Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Parkdale&#x27;s desirability stemmed from its proximity to the lake, the Canadian National Exhibition to the south-east and the popular Sunnyside Beach at the foot of Roncesvalles to the west. From 1911 to 1922, the Toronto Harbour Commission improved the lakefront extending the shoreline from the rail line south, with a breakwater and boardwalk. As an example, in 1905, the Parkdale Canoe Club (known today as the Boulevard Club) opened. When built, it was on a pier extending out into the lake. As part of the infill project, it became situated inland. To the east of the current building were baseball and lacrosse fields. It was the site of a popular women&#x27;s softball league for many years.

Sunnyside Amusement Park was opened in 1922, providing a popular day vacation for Torontonians. Movie theatres were opened, such as the Brighton on Roncesvalles and the Odeon on Queen Street to the east of Roncesvalles. Hotels like the Edgewater at Queen and Roncesvalles were established.

The Palais Royale at the eastern edge of Sunnyside Beach opened in 1922 as a canoe factory and dance hall. Many important big bands played there in the 1930s and the 1940s, and this attracted a large youth patronage. Many war-generation Torontonians courted their future partners in this building. The Palais Royale operates today as a special occasion hall and is a favourite venue for bands, including The Rolling Stones, who played a 2002 concert there, and has been the location for live recordings by Sloan and Downchild Blues Band.

===1950s-1970s: Gardiner Expressway and Southern section of Parkdale demolition===
In 1955, the city began work on the Gardiner Expressway, a limited access highway alongside the railway cut. The Sunnyside Amusement Park was demolished, except for the Bathing Pavilion and the Palais Royale hall. The southern section of Parkdale to the west of Dufferin, south of the railway was also demolished. Parkdale was now separated from Lake Ontario and Sunnyside Beach and the expressway effectively halved the amount of usable lakeside parkland. A reorganization of the area&#x27;s residential streets was also done. Patronage of the beach declined rapidly. Both the Parkdale and Sunnyside train stations closed during the 1970s.

The neighbourhood changed greatly after the highway was completed and the park closed. Population density increased with the building of numerous apartment buildings. Jameson Avenue, which became the conduit to the highway changed from single family homes to a street of apartment buildings, many cheaply built. Nearby, many of the mansions and large houses became makeshift low-rise &#x27;bachelorette&#x27; apartment buildings and rooming houses. Several had operated as tourist hotels for visitors to Sunnyside and the CNE. Industrial activity declined along the railways. One former industrial site on West Lodge Avenue became a two-tower apartment complex that has repeatedly been cited by the city for various by-law infractions. Businesses suffered during the transition, with leisure-type businesses compatible with the Park, such as the Brighton and Odeon theatres closing. Along Queen Street, which saw traffic decline substantially, many businesses closed or changed hands.

===1970s: Absorption of out-patients===
In the mid-1970s, the Government of Ontario decided to release many long-term care mental illness patients from its Queen Street and Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital facilities to integrate them into the community. Many of the remaining mansions of South Parkdale had already been converted to boarding houses, and were only a short distance away from the Queen Street hospital. Many illegal &#x27;bachelorette&#x27; units were also being created and the inexpensive rental stock of South Parkdale soon became home to many of the released patients. The area developed a reputation as a neighbourhood rife with poverty, crime, drugs, homelessness, and large numbers of people living with mental illness.

In 1977, the Parkdale Activity-Recreation Centre (PARC) was founded to operate a drop-in centre in Parkdale for survivors of mental health ailments, the homeless, the disabled and those with few resources. Community volunteers observed that there were a large number of adults living in rooming houses and boarding homes throughout the Parkdale community after local mental health facilities began to de-institutionalize psychiatric patients. Most of these adults possessed little income, had few or no family contacts, did not have a place to go during the day and had been ostracized. In 1980 PARC found funding, staff and a venue and opened its doors to provide support, meals, employment opportunities and various programs to people with serious mental health and addiction issues.

The Parkdale Village Business Improvement Area (BIA) was established in 1978, and represents the commercial strip on Queen Street West from Dufferin Street to Roncesvalles Avenue. The BIA has highlighted the uniqueness of this commercial district, including its restaurants, antique stores, cafés and shops.

===Recent===
Owing to the many affordable rental apartments and its proximity to the downtown core, Parkdale has evolved into a transient neighbourhood for many newcomers to Canada. Waves of Caribbean, Indian, Vietnamese, Filipino, Tamil, Chinese, Tibetan, Hungarian and Roma immigrants have marked Parkdale in different times between 1980 till present. Parkdale has, since the late 1990s, hosted a large number of Tibetan settlers, with the area known as Little Tibet becoming home to one of the largest Tibetan diaspora outside of India and Nepal. Parkdale has a number of settlement and immigration agencies that deal with the needs of the newcomers and provide them with the necessary support as they explore the opportunities provided in Canada. Some of the agencies are Parkdale Community Information Centre (PCIC), Parkdale Community Legal Services, PIA, and Culture Link. Parkdale is a mixed income neighbourhood,

Some of the recent developments in Parkdale include the Healthy Organic Parkdale Edibles (HOPE) garden in the Masaryk Park, south of Queen and on the west side of Cowan Avenue. This community garden was founded by Shannon Thompson of Greenest City, along with many community members to allow residents who don&#x27;t have growing space to grow food and build a more inclusive community area. The environmental and community organization based in Parkdale since 2006 works with food sovereignty, youth employment, environmental awareness and community building. Greenest City has also initiated the Youth Garden in Dunn Parkette. The volunteers of the two gardens also host festivals, workshops, field trips along with other activities and projects in the area.

The area has seen an influx of artists working in the relatively inexpensive spaces, close to the exhibit spaces on Queen Street within Parkdale and along Queen Street to the east. The opening of the Parkdale Arts and Cultural Centre, along with efforts to promote businesses in the area, such as the Parkdale-Liberty Economic Development Centre, has spurred the growth of a vibrant creative area along Queen Street, which puts on a large display during Toronto&#x27;s annual &#x27;Nuit Blanche.&#x27;

The housing stock has seen some gentrification, especially in the area north of Queen Street identified with the &quot;Roncesvalles Village&quot; area, again due to the relatively inexpensive property values. In recent years housing prices in Parkdale have caught up with much of the rest of Toronto. Still, sub-standard housing in the units within the older buildings remains a concern of local city councillors and local community members. Numerous conversions into bachelorettes were done illegally and conditions did not conform to building or fire codes. An initiative, known as the &quot;Parkdale Pilot Project&quot; was formed to address the illegal conversions, seeking to bring the buildings into line. One location on King Street was the location of the &#x27;Pope Squat&#x27; where Ontario Coalition Against Poverty activists squatted in a vacant apartment building during a visit of Pope John Paul II. After being vacant for over ten years (most of which it was owned by the Government of Ontario), the building eventually re-opened as apartments, after its redevelopment was approved by the Pilot Project&#x27;s housing committee.. An apartment building on the corner of Queen Street and Dowling Avenue also lay vacant for some time before being expropriated by the city for an affordable housing re-development. It is known as Edmond Place and is a partnership of the city with PARC.

The commercial uses along Queen Street West have seen changes. In 2013, a sudden proliferation of restaurants and bars in one area led to a bylaw limiting the number to 25% of establishments. The bylaw was rescinded in 2018, with a continuing prohibition on backyard and rooftop patios. In 2018, several vegan businesses owned by a single owner &quot;The 5700&quot; opened, between Dufferin and Brock Street. The company attempted to market the area as &quot;Vegandale&quot;, dropping the idea after community protest against gentrification and a conflict with the Parkdale Village BIA. Two of the businesses closed in 2020. An increase in the number of residents of Tibetan origin has led to the opening of Tibetan businesses and restaurants informally known as &quot;Little Tibet&quot;.

==Education==

There are four Toronto-based school boards that provides public education for the city, including the neighbourhood of Parkdale. Two of the four Toronto-based school boards are English first language public school boards, the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). The institutions operated by the other two Toronto-based school boards, the secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and separate Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, are French first language public school boards. However, neither French-language school board operates a school in Parkdale.

The following elementary and secondary schools are located in Parkdale:

* Parkdale Collegiate Institute, a TDSB secondary school on Jameson Avenue south of Queen Street. It was founded in the 1880s.
* Dr. Rita Cox – Kina Minogok Public School, is a TDSB elementary school on Close Avenue at King Street. Founded in 1887, it was previously known as Queen Victoria Public School. In 2022, it was renamed after Rita Cox, an influential head of the Parkdale branch of Toronto Public Library, and an Indigenous phrase.
* Parkdale Public School is a TDSB elementary school which includes preschool to grade 8. It is on Seaforth avenue.
* Holy Family Catholic School, a TCDSB elementary school, a part of Holy Family Parish on Close Avenue. Founded in 1900, two years before the parish church and present school opened at their current location, Holy Family School was created out of Toronto&#x27;s original west end parish and school of St. Helen&#x27;s and was first in Parkdale&#x27;s Masonic Hall on the south side of Queen Street near Dowling Ave. The school was served for many years by the Sisters of Loreto who commuted from their convent in Toronto&#x27;s downtown. As population increased in the Parkdale area, the school was enlarged many times such that the standing remains of the original building are now obscured. In 2004 a community centre opened in the school newly built additional building, also at that time, Toronto&#x27;s archbishop invited fathers of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri in Montreal to come to Toronto to serve Holy Family Church and school. When the original Holy Family Church burned in 1997, the congregation worshipped in the school while funds were raised to build a new church.

==Transportation==

There are several routes serving Parkdale. Along Queen and King Streets, streetcars provide service. Along Lansdowne Avenue and Dufferin Street, bus service is provided, connecting to the Bloor-Danforth subway to the north. The 504 King streetcar route along King Street connects to Dundas West station via Roncesvalles Avenue.

===Main streets===

Queen Street West running east–west is the primary commercial street of the neighbourhood. It is four lanes and the buildings are predominantly 2-3 storey buildings, often with apartments on the upper floors. It ends at Roncesvalles, meeting King Street and the Queensway at the &#x27;Sunnyside&#x27; intersection. It continues to the east to downtown. The business along Queen have formed a Business Improvement Association under the name of &quot;Parkdale Village.&quot; The street has numerous art galleries, restaurants, cafes and convenience stores. The Parkdale branch of the Toronto Public Library is at Cowan Avenue.

King Street West, running east–west is a major street continuing to the east to Toronto&#x27;s downtown, ending to the west at Sunnyside. From Roncesvalles east, it curves along the original shoreline, which is about above and inland from the shoreline. The south side in that area is open, with views of the Lake. It is predominantly residential, with a commercial section around the intersection with Dufferin Street.

Dufferin Street, running north–south is a major street starting from the CNE to the south, north to Queen Street, where it intersects the railway. The street continues one block to the north and continues north to north of Toronto. It is mixed commercial and residential. South of King along the east side is an old industrial area with loft-type industrial buildings. Construction has been completed to eliminate the Dufferin Street jog at Queen and the railway tracks. Dufferin Street now runs directly north to Wilson Avenue.

Lansdowne Avenue, running north–south from Queen Street north to St. Clair Avenue. It is predominantly a residential street. The former West Toronto Collegiate, now a francophone high school is at College Street and Lansdowne. The former National Cash Register factory at Dundas Street has been a grocery store since the 1980s.

Jameson Avenue, running north–south from Queen Street south to Lake Shore Boulevard. It is predominantly a residential street of apartment buildings. There are two schools on Jameson, Parkdale Collegiate, near Queen, and Queen Victoria Public, just south of King Street. It is also a busy thoroughfare on the west side of Toronto, connecting to the Gardiner Expressway and Lake Shore Boulevard.

<text>The coat of arms of Australia, officially the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, is a formal symbol of the Commonwealth of Australia. It depicts a shield, containing symbols of Australia&#x27;s six states, and is held up by native Australian animals, the kangaroo and the emu. The seven-pointed Commonwealth Star surmounting the crest also represents the states and territories, while golden wattle, the national floral emblem, appears below the shield.

The first arms were authorised by King Edward VII on 7 May 1908, and the current version by King George V on 19 September 1912, although the 1908 version continued to be used in some contexts, notably appearing on the reverse of the sixpenny coin.

==Design==

=== Escutcheon ===
The escutcheon (central shield) is the focal point of the coat of arms, and contains six quarters, each containing a representation of the badge of an Australian state. The whole shield is surrounded by an ermine border, which both symbolises the &quot;encompassing authority of the Australian crown&quot; and makes the shield a single device, instead of a collection of separate emblems. Historian Bruce Baskerville suggests the arms reflect the preamble of the Australian Constitution:

In the top half, from left to right, the states represented are New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. In the bottom half, from left to right: South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. 

=== Commonwealth Star ===
Above the shield is the seven-pointed Commonwealth Star or &quot;Star of Federation&quot; above a blue and gold wreath, forming the crest. Six of the points on the star represent the original six states, while the seventh point represents the territories.

=== Supporters ===
The red kangaroo and emu that support the shield have never been designated as official animal emblems of the nation. They owe their unofficial recognition to the fact that they are endemic Australian fauna (found only on that continent), and likely chosen because they are the most well-known native Australian animals large enough to be positioned together in scale holding up the shield. They symbolise progress and the nation moving forward as neither animal can easily walk backwards. Director of the Parliament House Art Collection, Justine Van Mourik has claimed that the kangaroo is, and must be seen to be, male, and this requirement led to a interpretation by John Coburn of the coat of arms for Parliament House to be rejected.

=== Background ===
In the background is a wreath of golden wattle, the official national floral emblem, though the representation of the species is not botanically accurate. At the bottom is a scroll that contains the name of the nation. While almost always depicted, these elements are technically optional artistic flourishes as they are not described in the royal warrant for the arms.
=== Blazon ===
The official blazon of the Commonwealth was included in a royal warrant of King George V on 19 September 1912, that officially granted the arms. The blazon is as follows:
The following is the blazon for the 1908 coat of arms:
==History==

By the 1820s, an unofficial coat of arms consisting of a shield depicting four symbols of commerce (a golden fleece, ship, anchor and wheat), supported by a kangaroo and emu with the motto &quot;Advance Australia&quot; was widely used across the eastern colonies of Australia. It appeared on buildings and personal goods as a branding device for Australia. These later formed the basis of the arms of New South Wales, Melbourne and Adelaide.

Following the federation of Australia, the first official coat of arms of Australia was designed by Wilson Dobbs and granted by King Edward VII on 7 May 1908.

It consisted of a shield in the centre, the seven pointed star on a wreath as the crest above it, and a kangaroo and an emu using its foot to help the kangaroo to support the shield, all on a bed of green grass with a scroll containing the motto &quot;Advance Australia&quot; (the same motto as the unofficial colonial arms). The selection of the kangaroo, the emu and the words, &quot;Advance Australia&quot; were tied together symbolically. The shield had a white background, with a red cross of Saint George, blue lines outside the cross, and a blue border containing six inescutcheons featuring a red chevron on white, representing the six states. These arms were used by the government and appeared on the sixpence coin from 1910 until 1963, and the threepence, shilling and florin from 1910 to 1936.

These arms were controversial even before they were granted. The Scottish Patriotic Association was vocally opposed to the shield&#x27;s design, noting that the inclusion of the Cross of Saint George should also require the inclusion of the Scottish and Irish crosses to represent the other settlers from the British Isles. They also objected to the lack of consultation with the heralds of Scotland and Ireland. Supported by the Victorian Scottish Union and the St Andrew Society, there were calls for the arms to be completely redesigned to either include symbols of all the British nationalities or instead use only Australian symbology.

William Gullick, designer of the New South Wales coat of arms, subsequently brought to public attention the existence of the Bowman Flag of 1805, which he suggested was the origin of the unofficial colonial arms. It depicted a rose, shamrock and thistle supported by a kangaroo and emu. He was then commissioned by the prime minister to redesign the arms. 

The 1908 arms were redesigned in 1911, and officially granted by George V on 19 September 1912. The redesign spurred much debate in Parliament. The member of Parliament for Wentworth, Willie Kelly, said:
Despite objections, the kangaroo and emu now not having its leg up remained the shield bearers in the new coat of arms and were modified to appear more realistic. To address concerns that Australia&#x27;s states were not individually represented, each state&#x27;s heraldic badge was depicted on the shield. Scottish criticism of the old arms was alleviated with the addition of the ermine border, a feature of Scottish heraldry. The new coat of arms removed the bed of grass beneath the shield and changed the scroll to read simply &quot;Australia&quot;. The colours in the wreath were also changed from blue and white to blue and gold. A background of two sprays of golden wattle was added, but it has never been an official part of the armorial bearings, although later golden wattle was proclaimed Australia&#x27;s national flower on 19 August 1988.

The use of each state&#x27;s badge had been a feature of the first Great Seal of Australia, introduced on 21 January 1904, where they surrounded the UK Royal Arms; according to Charles R. Wylie, badges were used because South Australia and Western Australia did not yet have coats of arms.

Darryl Lindsay in 1954 suggested that the arms were &quot;artistically bad&quot;, prompting the Menzies government to engage several artists (including Alistair Morrison, Alfred Cook, Cedric Emanuel and Eileen Mayo) to consider a redesign of the arms. While not wishing to change the major elements, the government &quot;was anxious&quot; to add a crown and remove the golden wattle (for ease of reproduction). Bill Taylor MP also suggested that the arms be reissued as a version of the royal arms, like the Canadian royal arms of 1921, to accord with Australia&#x27;s greater independence following the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot;. In 1955 a committee recommended a design by Mayo be adopted, which included a crown and an Aboriginal shield, but ultimately no changes were made.
==Use==
The Commonwealth Coat of Arms is the formal symbol of the Commonwealth of Australia that signifies Commonwealth authority and ownership. The Arms are used by Australian Government departments and agencies, statutory and non-statutory authorities, the Parliament and Commonwealth courts and tribunals. Senators and Federal Members of the Australian Parliament may also use the Arms in the course of their duties as Parliamentarians. The coat of arms should never be used where it could wrongly imply a formal guarantee, sponsorship or endorsement by the Commonwealth. Use of the arms by private citizens or organisations is rarely permitted; however, there are provisions for use by sporting bodies and in educational publications. For instance, the arms appear on the uniforms of the Australian Olympic Team and the Matildas. Use of the coat of arms without permission may breach the &quot;Competition and Consumer Act 2010&quot;, section 145.1 of the &quot;Criminal Code Act 1995&quot; or section 39(2) of the &quot;Trade Marks Act 1995&quot;. The import of goods bearing the arms is also illegal according to the &quot;Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations&quot;.

There is a full colour version and nine heraldically correct official versions exist for single-colour reproduction.

The coat of arms is the basis of Charles III&#x27;s Personal Australian Flag, and since 1973 a slightly modified version has formed the basis of the Great Seal of Australia.

The coat of arms has appeared on Australian coinage since the coins for the Australian pound were minted in the early 20th century. Until 1936, the 1908 coat of arms featured on the reverse of all silver coins in regular circulation(3d, 6d, 1&#x27;/, 2&#x27;/). After 1936, the current coat of arms was featured on the reverse of the Florin (2&#x27;/), while the 1908 arms remained on the sixpence (6d). Since decimalisation in 1966, the current coat of arms has featured on the reverse of both variants of the 50-cent coin.

The coat of arms is used as badge of rank for Warrant Officers Class 1 (Army) and Warrant Officer (Navy and Air Force). A more stylised version is used as a badge of rank for Warrant Officer of the Navy, Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army and Warrant Officer of the Air Force.

Australians are sometimes erroneously claimed to be the only people who eat the animals on their coat of arms, and the combination of both kangaroo and emu meat in a single dish such as pie or pizza is known as the Coat of Arms.

<text>Houdan () is a commune of the Yvelines department west of Paris in the north of France.

==History==

The name has evolved from the Saxon &quot;Hoding,&quot; meaning &quot;settlement on the hill&quot;. Houdan is thought to have been inhabited since the 5th century. By the 12th century, two churches and a château were present.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the town changed hands and was pillaged frequently. The town was destroyed; only the 12th century keep survives from that period. After the war, the town was ruled by the English until 1475.

Houdan is mentioned in the Prophecies of Nostradamus.

Houdan was a staging post on the road from Paris to Brittany, and many old inns are still standing.

Houdan was also an important poultry market for Paris and a breed is named after the town. The breed is ornamental, but is also used for its meat and white eggs.

It is the site of the Boldoflorine factory which over the years had transformed from absinthe distillery to producer of herbal remedies and tisanes. In the 2000s the factory was converted to residential use.

==Population==
==Infrastructure==
Houdan station is on the train line between Dreux station in Eure-et-Loir, and the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. It is on the route nationale 12 connecting Paris with Brittany, which once passed through, but now bypasses, the town.

==Attractions==

* Vestiges of the old town wall fortifications, including a keep built around 1135.
* Houses of the 15th and 16th centuries.
* Church, 15th - 17th centuries, Gothic style containing an organ (1735), and a Renaissance-style choir.

==International relations==
Houdan is twinned with:
* Pangbourne, United Kingdom
* Baïla, Sénégal

It is sometimes spelled &quot;Panchāngamu, Pancanga&quot;, &quot;Panchanga&quot;, &quot;Panchaanga&quot;, or &quot;Panchānga&quot;, and is often pronounced &quot;Panchāng&quot;. Panchangas are used in Jyotisha () (Indian astrology).

In Nepal and Eastern India, including Assam, Bengal and Odisha, the Panchangam is referred to as Panjika, and in the Mithila region, it is known as Maithili Panchang or Patra.

== Overview ==
Panchāngams are published in India by many authors, societies, academies, and universities. Different publications differ only minutely, at least for a casual or not yet trained reader. They forecast celestial phenomena such as solar eclipses, forecasting weather (rain, dry spells) as well as more mundane occurrences.

The study of Panchāngams involves understanding &quot;Rasi phala&quot; (also pronounced &#x27;Rashi phala&#x27;), the impact of the signs of the zodiac on the individual. Astrologers consult the Panchāngam to set auspicious dates for weddings, corporate mergers, and other activities as per their religion.

The casting of a Panchāngam involves elaborate mathematical work involving high level of spherical geometry and sound understanding of astronomical phenomena, such as sidereal movements of celestial bodies. However, in practice the tabulation is done on the basis of short-cut formulations as propounded by ancient Vedic sages and scholars.

A typical Panchāngam may state tabulations of positions of Sun, Moon, and other planets for every day of the year on a fixed place (longitude, latitude) and time of day (in 24-hour format IST). The users calculate the remaining data using their relative difference from this fixed place and time.

There are several panchāngas that contain information for more than one year. There is one, Vishvavijaya Panchāngam, that covers 100 years.

The theories propounded in the two scriptures, Surya Siddhanta and Grahalaghava formed the basis for the myriad calendars or Panchāngas in the past in different regions of India.

The Grahalaghava was compiled about 600 years ago and Surya Siddhanta was available long before that. These had become outdated and did not tally with actual astronomical events and did not tally with each other. Hence, a committee was appointed by the Government of India with experts in the field drawn from various parts of the country who were involved with preparation of Panchāngam in local languages to draw up a reliable Panchāngam in which the mathematical calculations provides the positions of grahas (the planets) and nakshatras (constellations) in the sky as they are observed.

Thus, the Government of India has prepared the National Panchānga or the Indian national calendar in 1957 (was proposed by Meghnad Saha and Lahiri in 1952), which is used in predictive astrology. The Lahiris Ephemeris published annually is the most widely used English almanac in Vedic astrology, many Panchāngas are published in local languages, which are mostly based on the National Panchānga. The[Bangalore press publishes Mallige Panchanga Darshini calendar every year

==Etymology==
Accuracy of attributes depending upon the Moon&#x27;s motions were considered most crucial for the reliability of a panchāngam, because the Moon is the fastest among all heavenly entities shown in traditional panchāngas. Tithi, Nakshatra, Rāśi, Yoga, and Karana depend upon Moon&#x27;s motions, which are five in number. &quot;Panchānga&quot; is a Sanskrit word, literally meaning &quot;having five limbs&quot;. If these five limbs, for example, the five attributes depending upon Moon, are accurate, an almanac is held to be reliable, because other elements are not so difficult to compute due to their slow rates of change.

There are three popular meanings of panchāngam:

# In Vedic astrology, meaning &quot;five attributes&quot; of the day. They are:
#* Tithi - Ending Moment (EM) of elongation of the Moon, the lunar day, the angular relationship between Sun and Moon ( Apparent Moon &quot;minus&quot; Apparent Sun). One Tithi equals 12 degree difference between Moon and Sun.
#* Nakshatram - EM of asterism of the day, that is, the stellar mansion in which Moon is located for an observer at the center of the Earth. One Nakshatra equals 13 degrees:20 minutes. There are 27 Nakshatra in 360 degrees.
#* Yoga - EM of the angular relationship between Sun and Moon( Apparent Moon &quot;plus&quot; Apparent Sun). One Yoga equals 13 degrees:20 minutes. There are 27 Yogas in 360 degrees.
#* Karana - EM of half of a Tithi. One equals 6 degree difference between Moon and Sun.
#* &quot;Vāra&quot;, weekday, the seven weekdays.
#*:Monier-Williams gives &quot;solar day&quot; instead of Rāśi as the fifth limb. Some people enumerate &quot;Vāra&quot; (days of the week) instead. &quot;Vāra&quot; or solar days do not involve intricate computations, unlike EM of Rāśi; however, in the Hindu system the five elements only constitute the five limbs of the Panchāngam.
# An almanac that contains the astronomical / astrological daily details also came to be called a panchāngam because of the importance of five attributes.
# Panchānga-pūjan, which is a part of Ganesh-Ambika-pūjan.

In Vedic astrology, the basic tenet of astrology was integrated with celestial events and thus was born various branches of Vedic astrology and the Panchānga. In simple terms, &quot;Panchānga&quot; means the Day, Nakshatra (Star), tithi, Yoga and Karana every day. It is a mirror of the sky. The document used as Panchāngam has evolved over the last 5000 years. The theories propounded in the two scriptures, Surya Siddhanta and Grahalaghava formed the basis for the plethora of calendars or Panchāngas in the past in different regions of the country - a culturally complex system.

The five Angas or parts of Panchāngam are elaborated in the following paragraphs but before that the composition of the Samvatsara OR Years (60 Years cycle), Varsha or Year and Masa or month are first explained, as these important calendar events are part of every Panchānga. All the components of Panchangam are relevant in Predictive Astrology, Prasna Shastra (electional astrology), etc.

All followers and practitioners of Vedic astrology must know how to read a Panchāngam and in this context it is necessary to know the terminology used in the Panchāngam for different time slots of the day. Panchāngas are also published in English as Ephemeris - The Lahiris Ephemeris is most widely used, which gives all the details as contained in a traditional Panchāngam published in Sanskrit or Hindi and all the regional languages of the country.

There are several forms of reckoning the &quot;varsha&quot; or year based on solar entry (solar ingress), lunar entry, Jupiter entry in a sign or the Julian calendar of starting the year from the first of January, but the most widely accepted practice in India is the Samvatsara, a 60 years cycle based on solar entry. Each zodiacal sign is represented by five years starting from Pramadi and the sixty years are equally distributed in successive order among the twelve signs (Rasis) starting from Mesha (Aries) and ending in Meena (Pisces).

Varsha or the year, used in astrological context refers to the solar calendar of year and months, which starts with Sun entering Aries (Mesha Rasi) and completing a full circle of the zodiac in a period of twelve months.

There are two kinds of lunar months followed in India - the new moon ending called the Amanta or Sukladi system and the full moon ending (covering one full moon to the next) called the Purnimanta system. But it is the lunar months (full moon reckoned), which are reckoned in predictive astrology, and each represents the name of the star on full moon day of the solar months. The twelve lunar months starting from Chaitra along with the names of the solar months are given below.
In Vedic astrology, the basic tenets of astrology were integrated with celestial events with &quot;vara&quot; or weekday and thus was born the Muhurtha astrology or electional astrology.

Tithi or Lunar day is an important concept in Hindu astrology. It means lunation. There are thirty &quot;tithis&quot; in a Lunar month distributed in the 360 degrees of the Zodiac and each tithi is completed when the longitude of the Moon gains exactly twelve degrees or its multiple on that of the Sun. By name there are only 15 tithis repeating in the two halves of the month – Shukla 1 to Shukla 15 (known as Poornima or Full Moon) and Krishna 1 to 15 (known as Amavasya or New Moon). In astrological parlance tithi has great significance in the fact that each tithi from 1 to 14 in both Pakshas has what are called &quot;daghda rasis&quot; or burnt rasis – two rasis for each tithi except Chaturdasiwhich has four daghda rasis. But new moon and full moon have no dagdha rasis. The tithis are divided into five groups as under.

# Nanda (Ananda or Joyous) tithi - Prathipada (1st), Shasti (6th) and Ekadashi (11th);
# Bhadra (Arogya or Mangala or Healthy) tithis on – Dvitiya (2nd), Saptami (7th) and Dvadashi (12th);
# Jaya (Victory) tithi –Tuesday- Tritiya (3rd), Ashtami (8th ) and Trayodashi (13th);
# Rikktha (Loss or Nashta) tithis – Saturday - Chathurthi (4th) Navami (9th) and Chaturdashi (14th);
# Purna (Sampurna - Full Moon or New Moon) tithis –Thursday Panchami (5th), Dashami (10th) and Amavasya (New Moon) or Purnima.

A unique Vedic system is followed in Muhurtha astrology, Horary astrology and predictive astrology, which envisages grouping of Nakshtaras (stars) into nine sub-groups. Each sub-group covers three stars and has a specific name of ‘Tara’ proceeded by a word defining benefic or malefic nature. These are found to be extremely useful in Vedic astrology which is widely practiced in India.

The nine &quot;taras&quot; (star groups) by their individual names are listed below.

# Janma (Birth/Ascendant/Lagna) Tara – The Janma (Birth Star/Ascendant Star also known as Lagna Nakshatra) Nakshatra, the 10th from Janma nakshatra also known as Karna nakshatra and the 19th from Janma nakshatra known as Adhana nakshatra constitute this tara.
# Sampat Tara – The 2nd the 11th and the 20th Nakshatras counted from Janma nakshatra constitute this tara.
# Vipat Tara – The 3rd, the 12th and the 21st stars counted from Janma nakshatra constitute this tara.
# Kshema Tara – The 4th, the 13th and the 22nd Nakshatras counted from the janama nakshatra constitute this tara.
# Pratyaka Tara – The 5t, the 14th, and the 23rd nakshatras from Janma nakshatra constitute this tara.
# Sadhaka Tara – The 6th, the 15th, and the 24th nakshatras from Janma nakshatra constitute this tara.
# Nidhana Tara – The 7th, the 16th, and the 25th nakshatras from the Janma nakshatra constitute this tara.
# Mitra Tara – The 8th, the 17th and the 26th nakshatras from Janma nakshatra constitute this tara.
# Ati or Parama Mitra Tara – The 9th, the 18th and the 27th nakshatras from Janma nakshatra constitute this tara.

==Usage==
The basic purpose of Hindu Panchāngam is to check various Hindu festivals and auspicious time (election- Muhurta). In the Hindu system of election, various element of Panchāngam constitute auspicious and inauspicious moments (Yogas) by combination of weekday-Tithi, weekday-constellation, weekdays-Tithis-constellations. In addition, individual weekdays, Tithis, constellations, Yoga and Karanas have been prescribed for specific activities which fructify during their currency.

For selecting an auspicious moment Panchāngam Shuddhi (purified-time) is fundamental. In addition favourable transits, purified ascendant, absence of malefic yogas, favourable Dasha (Hindu progression), name of doer, propitiations, chanting of Mantras, place of activity, social customs, omens, mode of breathing are also examined.

<text>Sovata (; ; : ) is a town in Mureș County, Transylvania, Romania. Three villages are administered by the town: Căpeți (&quot;Kopac&quot;), Ilieși (&quot;Illyésmező&quot;), and Săcădat (&quot;Szakadát&quot;). In 2004, the village of Sărățeni broke away to form an independent commune.

As well as being a spa town, Sovata is on the route of the Via Transilvanica long-distance trail, which also passes through the village of Săcădat.

==Geography==
The town is part of the Székely Land region of the historical Transylvania province. It is located in the eastern part of Mureș County, on the border with Harghita County; the county capital, Târgu Mureș, is to the west.

Sovata lies at the foot of the Gurghiu Mountains, at an altitude between . It is situated between the river Corund and the valley of the Târnava Mică. The river Sovata discharges into the Târnava Mică in the town. 

Sovata can be reached from Târgu Mureș, Miercurea-Ciuc, and Odorheiu Secuiesc on the national road and from Reghin on a connection road.

==History==

The first data about Sovata are from 1578. By 1583 it was already a village. For 42 years, from 1876 until 1918, the village belonged to the Maros-Torda County of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.

Due to its salty lakes and warm water it became an increasingly popular health resort during the end of the 19th and the 20th century. It gained the status of town in 1952.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 census, the town had a population of 10,385, of which 87.7% were Hungarians, 8.2% Romanians, and 1.9% Roma. At the 2021 census, Sovata had a population of 9,703, of which 82.81% were Hungarians, 8.51% Romanians, and 2.12% Roma. 

&quot;Demographic movement according to census data:&quot;
==Spa==
The geological events in 1875 gave birth to the Bear Lake, which is unique in Europe, its water being helio-thermal and salty, with purported therapeutic effects for chronic gynaecological symptoms, severe rheumatic pains, peripheral nervous system, and post-accidental motor diseases.

There are four more salty lakes: Nut Lake, Black Lake, Red Lake, and Green Lake. In the interwar period, Sovata became one of the most fashionable spas in the country, visited several times even by the Romanian Royal Family.

==People from Sovata==
* Nahum (Nachum) Gantz Ostolish (1926–2005), a Knesset (parliamentary) candidate, local head of Mapai party and &quot;moshav&quot; (type of farm) movement and co-founder of Kfar Ahim moshav , Israel, father of Benny Gantz, leading Israeli politician

<text>Jibou (; ; ; ) is a town in Sălaj County, Transylvania, Romania. In 2021 it had a population of 9,677. Jibou includes the town proper and other four villages: Rona (Hungarian: &quot;Szilágyróna&quot;), Cuceu (&quot;Kucsó&quot;), Husia (&quot;Hosszúújfalu&quot;), and Var (&quot;Szamosőrmező&quot;).

Jibou is northeast of the county seat Zalău; the two are linked by national road and county road DJ108A, as well as by railroad. Its major attractions are the old Wesselényi Castle, Vasile Fati Botanical Garden, and the thermal baths.

== Geography ==

Jibou is situated in the northeastern region of Sălaj County, Romania. It is positioned on the left bank of the Someș River, where it meets the Agrij River. The town is located at the coordinates of approximately 47°16′N latitude and 23°15′E longitude.

== History ==

The city is located in a Daco-Roman area and developed early as a rural settlement. The first documentary attestation of Jibou dates to 1205, under the name &quot;Chybur&quot;. Among the many names Jibou bore are the titles &quot;villa&quot; (town) in 1219 and &quot;oppidum&quot; (fortified town) in 1564, which attest the importance of the locality at the time. Jibou is likely older than its first documentary attestation, given that the Roman road connecting the castra of Tihău with that of Porolissum passed through its boundary. The other component localities were noted a little later: Rona in 1338, Cuceu in 1388, Husia in 1405 and Var in 1469. The development of Jibou continued in medieval times, but suffered from Turkish invasions such as those in 1610 and 1665.

Documents of the time attested that residents here have participated in the Bobâlna uprising (1437) and the revolt led by Gheorghe Doja in 1514. Locals fought oppression by outlawry and local uprisings, which have been reported both in the 17th century, and in the 18th century. During the rebellion led by Horea, Cloșca and Crișan in 1784 and during the revolution of 1848, serfs in Jibou have been with the thought and deeds by the side of other exploited inhabitants of the Transylvanian settlements, regardless of nationality. 

Jibou is well known for his participation in the Kurucz rebellion (1703–1711) (see &quot;Battle of Zsibó&quot;) taken against Habsburg rule. The Wesselényi family played an important role in the evolution of Jibou, which built a castle there in 1584; today, only traces of the foundation are preserved. The construction of the current castle, the largest baroque complex in Transylvania, began in 1778 and lasted more than 30 years. The most prominent representative of this family was Baron Miklós Wesselényi Jr., who lived between 1796 and 1850. He fought for the liberation of the serfs, being considered the leader of the reformist Hungarian nobility opposition, which struggled against the conservatism of Habsburg monarchy.

In 1781, his father, Miklós Wesselényi Sr., conflicts with aulic chancellor Johan Haller, his neighbor from Gârbou. On 16 October 1781, with an army of 540 people, armed &quot;some with rifles, most with scythes, iron pitchforks, cudgels&quot; and 12 outlaws (), Miklós Wesselényi appears at Gârbou, taking Haller by surprise, who did not expect such a gesture. As a result of this conflict, Haller sends Wesselényi to trial for six counts: &quot;blasphemy, crooked oath, fire implementing threat, challenge to a duel, infestation and arrest of royal officials, disturbing public security&quot;. The process is settled only after three years, when the very Emperor Joseph II, son of Maria Theresa, condemns Wesselényi to several years of prison at Kufstein.

The last forty-eighter revolutionary army in Europe, made up of about 8,000 soldiers commanded by General Kazinczy, capitulated at the castle on 25 August 1849. From 1876 to 1920, Jibou was part of the Szilágy County of the Kingdom of Hungary.

The inauguration of the Dej–Jibou–Zalău railway in 1890, and over several years to Baia Mare, led Jibou to become an important railway center. Through the development of industries and construction of railway the number of employees and workers increased. Nevertheless, agriculture remained main branch of the economy, especially after the introduction of alternative crops and the use of agricultural machines. To the end of 19th century in Jibou established many Jewish families, which made to increase the role of exchange of the locality. The main occupation of the Jews was trade; they opened a number of stores.
After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia (1 December 1918) was also attended by delegates from Jibou, headed by Gheorghe Petruca. Following the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of Jibou in April 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The town officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. During the interwar period, it became the seat of plasa Jibou, in Sălaj County. In August 1940, under the auspices of Nazi Germany, which imposed the Second Vienna Award, Hungary retook the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included Jibou) from Romania. Towards the end of World War II, however, the city was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces on 16 October 1944. In 1950, Jibou became a raion seat within the Cluj Region; it lost the statute in 1960, when the raion seat became Zalău. Jibou was declared a town in 1968, when a new administrative law was adopted, and Jibou became once again part of Zalău County.

== Demography ==


Before it came under Romanian authority, the majority of the inhabitants were Hungarians. According to data of the 1910 census, 532 out of 3,047 were Romanians and 2,481 Hungarians. 

According to the census of 2011, the town numbered at that time 10,407 inhabitants, of which 5,141 were male and 5,266 female. The decrease in population was mainly due to negative natural growth, but also emigration to other western European countries. The city&#x27;s population was made up of 8,210 Romanians (9,181 in 2002), alongside also live 1,192 Hungarians (1,503 in 2002), 584 Roma (603 in 2002), 5 Ukrainians (3 in 2002), 3 Slovaks (2 in 2002), 7 of other nationalities, and 401 of undeclared ethnicity. Regarding religious confessions, 7,153 were Orthodox (9,044 in 2002), 151 Roman Catholic (162 in 2002), 127 Greek Catholic (175 in 2002), 1,088 Reformed (1,520 in 2002), 4 Unitarians (1 in 2002), 402 Baptist (500 in 2002), 746 Pentecostal (560 in 2002), 7 Seventh-day Adventist (12 in 2002), 12 Evangelical (8 in 2002), 3 Muslim (2 in 2002), 220 Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, 14 other religions, 11 without religion (6 in 2002), 5 atheists (2 in 2002), and 460 with undeclared religion.

<doc id="457036" wikidata="Q279055" url="?curid=457036" title="Sulfur hexafluoride">
<text>Sulfur hexafluoride or sulphur hexafluoride (British spelling) is an inorganic compound with the formula SF6. It is a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and non-toxic gas. has an octahedral geometry, consisting of six fluorine atoms attached to a central sulfur atom. It is a hypervalent molecule.

Typical for a nonpolar gas, is poorly soluble in water but quite soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. It has a density of 6.12 g/L at sea level conditions, considerably higher than the density of air (1.225 g/L). It is generally stored and transported as a liquefied compressed gas.

 has 23,500 times greater global warming potential (GWP) than as a greenhouse gas (over a 100-year time-frame) but exists in relatively minor concentrations in the atmosphere. Its concentration in Earth&#x27;s troposphere reached 11.50 parts per trillion (ppt) in October 2023, rising at 0.37 ppt/year. The increase since 1980 is driven in large part by the expanding electric power sector, including fugitive emissions from banks of gas contained in its medium- and high-voltage switchgear. Uses in magnesium, aluminium, and electronics manufacturing also hastened atmospheric growth. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which came into force in 2005, is supposed to limit emissions of this gas. In a somewhat nebulous way it has been included as part of the carbon emission trading scheme. In some countries this has led to the defunction of entire industries.

==Synthesis and reactions==

Sulfur hexafluoride on Earth exists primarily as a synthetic industrial gas, but has also been found to occur naturally.

 can be prepared from the elements through exposure of  to . This was the method used by the discoverers Henri Moissan and Paul Lebeau in 1901. Some other sulfur fluorides are cogenerated, but these are removed by heating the mixture to disproportionate any  (which is highly toxic) and then scrubbing the product with NaOH to destroy remaining .

Alternatively, using bromine, sulfur hexafluoride can be synthesized from SF4 and CoF3 at lower temperatures (e.g. 100 °C), as follows:

There is virtually no reaction chemistry for . A main contribution to the inertness of SF6 is the steric hindrance of the sulfur atom, whereas its heavier group 16 counterparts, such as SeF6 are more reactive than SF6 as a result of less steric hindrance. It does not react with molten sodium below its boiling point, but reacts exothermically with lithium. As a result of its inertness, has an atmospheric lifetime of around 3200 years, and no significant environmental sinks other than the ocean.

==Applications==
By 2000, the electrical power industry is estimated to use about 80% of the sulfur hexafluoride produced, mostly as a gaseous dielectric medium. Other main uses as of 2015 included a silicon etchant for semiconductor manufacturing, and an inert gas for the casting of magnesium.

===Dielectric medium===
 is used in the electrical industry as a gaseous dielectric medium for high-voltage sulfur hexafluoride circuit breakers, switchgear, and other electrical equipment, often replacing oil-filled circuit breakers (OCBs) that can contain harmful polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). gas under pressure is used as an insulator in gas insulated switchgear (GIS) because it has a much higher dielectric strength than air or dry nitrogen. The high dielectric strength is a result of the gas&#x27;s high electronegativity and density. This property makes it possible to significantly reduce the size of electrical gear. This makes GIS more suitable for certain purposes such as indoor placement, as opposed to air-insulated electrical gear, which takes up considerably more room.

Gas-insulated electrical gear is also more resistant to the effects of pollution and climate, as well as being more reliable in long-term operation because of its controlled operating environment. Exposure to an arc chemically breaks down though most of the decomposition products tend to quickly re-form , a process termed &quot;self-healing&quot;. Arcing or corona can produce disulfur decafluoride (), a highly toxic gas, with toxicity similar to phosgene. was considered a potential chemical warfare agent in World War II because it does not produce lacrimation or skin irritation, thus providing little warning of exposure.

 is also commonly encountered as a high voltage dielectric in the high voltage supplies of particle accelerators, such as Van de Graaff generators and Pelletrons and high voltage transmission electron microscopes.

Alternatives to as a dielectric gas include several fluoroketones. Compact GIS technology that combines vacuum switching with clean air insulation has been introduced for a subset of applications up to 420 kV.

===Medical use===
 is used to provide a tamponade or plug of a retinal hole in retinal detachment repair operations in the form of a gas bubble. It is inert in the vitreous chamber. The bubble initially doubles its volume in 36 hours due to oxygen and nitrogen entering it, before being absorbed in the blood in 10–14 days.

 is used as a contrast agent for ultrasound imaging. Sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles are administered in solution through injection into a peripheral vein. These microbubbles enhance the visibility of blood vessels to ultrasound. This application has been used to examine the vascularity of tumours. It remains visible in the blood for 3 to 8 minutes, and is exhaled by the lungs.

===Tracer compound===
Sulfur hexafluoride was the tracer gas used in the first roadway air dispersion model calibration; this research program was sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and conducted in Sunnyvale, California on U.S. Highway 101. Gaseous is used as a tracer gas in short-term experiments of ventilation efficiency in buildings and indoor enclosures, and for determining infiltration rates. Two major factors recommend its use: its concentration can be measured with satisfactory accuracy at very low concentrations, and the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere has a negligible concentration of .

Sulfur hexafluoride was used as a non-toxic test gas in an experiment at St John&#x27;s Wood tube station in London, United Kingdom on 25 March 2007. The gas was released throughout the station, and monitored as it drifted around. The purpose of the experiment, which had been announced earlier in March by the Secretary of State for Transport Douglas Alexander, was to investigate how toxic gas might spread throughout London Underground stations and buildings during a terrorist attack.

Sulfur hexafluoride is also routinely used as a tracer gas in laboratory fume hood containment testing. The gas is used in the final stage of ASHRAE 110 fume hood qualification. A plume of gas is generated inside of the fume hood and a battery of tests are performed while a gas analyzer arranged outside of the hood samples for SF6 to verify the containment properties of the fume hood.

It has been used successfully as a transient tracer in oceanography to study mixing and air-sea gas exchange. The concentration of sulfur hexafluoride in seawater (typically on the order of femtomoles per kilogram) has been classified by the international oceanography community as a &quot;level one&quot; measurement, denoting the highest priority data for observing ocean changes.

===Other uses===
* The magnesium industry uses as an inert &quot;cover gas&quot; to prevent oxidation during casting, and other processes including smelting. Once the largest user, consumption has declined greatly with capture and recycling.
* Insulated glazing windows have used it as a filler to improve their thermal and acoustic insulation performance.
* plasma is used in the semiconductor industry as an etchant in processes such as deep reactive-ion etching. A small fraction of the breaks down in the plasma into sulfur and fluorine, with the fluorine ions performing a chemical reaction with silicon. 
* Tires filled with it take longer to deflate from diffusion through rubber due to the larger molecule size.
* Nike likewise used it to obtain a patent and to fill the cushion bags in all of their &quot;Air&quot;-branded shoes from 1992 to 2006. 277 tons was used during the peak in 1997. 
* The United States Navy&#x27;s Mark 50 torpedo closed Rankine-cycle propulsion system is powered by sulfur hexafluoride in an exothermic reaction with solid lithium.
* Waveguides in high-power microwave systems are pressurized with it. The gas electrically insulates the waveguide, preventing internal arcing.
* Electrostatic loudspeakers have used it because of its high dielectric strength and high molecular weight.
* Disulfur decafluoride, a chemical weapon, is produced with it as a feedstock.
* For entertainment purposes, when breathed, causes the voice to become significantly deeper, due to its density being so much higher than air. This phenomenon is related to the more well-known effect of breathing low-density helium, which causes someone&#x27;s voice to become much higher. Both of these effects should only be attempted with caution as these gases displace oxygen that the lungs are attempting to extract from the air. Sulfur hexafluoride is also mildly anesthetic.
* For science demonstrations / magic as &quot;invisible water&quot; since a light foil boat can be floated in a tank, as will an air-filled balloon.
*It is used for benchmark and calibration measurements in Associative and Dissociative Electron Attachment (DEA) experiments

==Greenhouse gas==

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is the most potent greenhouse gas. Its global warming potential of 23,900 times that of  when compared over a 100-year period. Sulfur hexafluoride is inert in the troposphere and stratosphere and is extremely long-lived, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800–3,200 years.

Measurements of SF6 show that its global average mixing ratio has increased from a steady base of about 54 parts per quadrillion prior to industrialization, to over 11.5 parts per trillion (ppt) as of October 2023, and is increasing by about 0.4 ppt (3.5%) per year. Average global SF6 concentrations increased by about 7% per year during the 1980s and 1990s, mostly as the result of its use in magnesium production, and by electrical utilities and electronics manufacturers. Given the small amounts of SF6 released compared to carbon dioxide, its overall individual contribution to global warming is estimated to be less than 0.2%, however the collective contribution of it and similar man-made halogenated gases has reached about 10% as of 2020. Alternatives are being tested.

In Europe, falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its use for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except high-voltage switchgear. It was reported in 2013 that a three-year effort by the United States Department of Energy to identify and fix leaks at its laboratories in the United States such as the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where the gas is used as a high voltage insulator, had been productive, cutting annual leaks by . This was done by comparing purchases with inventory, assuming the difference was leaked, then locating and fixing the leaks.

==Physiological effects and precautions==
Sulfur hexafluoride is a nontoxic gas, but by displacing oxygen in the lungs, it also carries the risk of asphyxia if too much is inhaled. Since it is more dense than air, a substantial quantity of gas, when released, will settle in low-lying areas and present a significant risk of asphyxiation if the area is entered. That is particularly relevant to its use as an insulator in electrical equipment since workers may be in trenches or pits below equipment containing .
As with all gases, the density of affects the resonance frequencies of the vocal tract, thus changing drastically the vocal sound qualities, or timbre, of those who inhale it. It does not affect the vibrations of the vocal folds. The density of sulfur hexafluoride is relatively high at room temperature and pressure due to the gas&#x27;s large molar mass. Unlike helium, which has a molar mass of about 4 g/mol and pitches the voice up, has a molar mass of about 146 g/mol, and the speed of sound through the gas is about 134 m/s at room temperature, pitching the voice down. For comparison, the molar mass of air, which is about 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, is approximately 30 g/mol which leads to a speed of sound of 343 m/s.

Sulfur hexafluoride has an anesthetic potency slightly lower than nitrous oxide; it is classified as a mild anesthetic.

<text>The current coat of arms of the Republic of Austria has been in use in its first forms by the First Republic of Austria since 1919. Between 1934 and the German annexation in 1938, the &quot;Federal State (Bundesstaat Österreich)&quot; used a different coat of arms, which consisted of a double-headed eagle (one-party corporate state led by the clerico-right-wing Fatherland Front, often labeled Austro-fascist).

The establishment of the Second Republic in 1945 saw the return of the original arms, with broken chains added to symbolise Austria&#x27;s liberation. In 1981 the &quot;Wappen der Republik Österreich (Bundeswappen)&quot; described the blazon in the Federal Constitutional Law (Austrian act) (&quot;Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz&quot;, B-VG). With this change of law it was defined that the specific drawing is to codificate in an own statute law and that all other versions of the coat of arms of Austria were no longer in law. In accordance to this the &quot;Wappengesetz&quot; from 1984 and the drawing of the actual &quot;Wappen der Republik Österreich&quot; is in Austrian law. The often used &quot;Bundesadler&quot; (federal eagle) is only a synonymous term in colloquial language.

==Description==

===Appearance===
In Art. 8a Abs. 2 B-VG the blazon of the Federal Arms of the Republic of Austria is described as follows:
&quot;Das Wappen der Republik Österreich (Bundeswappen) besteht aus einem freischwebenden, einköpfigen, schwarzen, golden gewaffneten und rot bezungten Adler, dessen Brust mit einem roten, von einem silbernen Querbalken durchzogenen Schild belegt ist. Der Adler trägt auf seinem Haupt eine goldene Mauerkrone mit drei sichtbaren Zinnen. Die beiden Fänge umschließt eine gesprengte Eisenkette. Er trägt im rechten Fang eine goldene Sichel mit einwärts gekehrter Schneide, im linken Fang einen goldenen Hammer.&quot;

In translation:
&quot;The coat of arms of the Republic of Austria (federal coat of arms) consists of a free-floating, single-headed, black eagle with golden arms and a red tongue, whose chest is covered with a red shield crossed by a silver crossbar. The eagle wears a golden mural crown with three visible pinnacles on its head. A broken iron chain encloses the two talons. In his right talon he carries a golden sickle with the edge turned inwards, in his left talon a golden hammer.&quot;

In accordance of Art. 8a Abs. 3 the actual withdrawn of the &quot;Wappen der Republik Österreich&quot; is in law as of § 1 Wappengesetz from 1984:
&quot;Das Wappen der Republik Österreich (Bundeswappen) ist im Art. 8a Abs. 2 B-VG bestimmt und entspricht der Zeichnung des Bundeswappens in der einen Bestandteil dieses Gesetzes bildenden Anlage 1.&quot;

This artistic version as above described with the drawing in attachment 1 of Wappengesetz 1984 in which the eagle&#x27;s feathers are grey and detailed, with the colours of bluegrey for the chain and dark gold for the other signs, is the actual official coat of arms of the Republic of Austria. There are some other different versions of the arms in use as of more in accordance to the blason of Art. 8a Abs. 2 B-VG, in which the eagle is represented plain black, the undefined colour of the chain and the yellow as heraldic gold. All these versions are used in parallel.

===Symbolism===
The symbols and emblems used in the Austrian arms are as follows:

*&quot;The Eagle:&quot; Austria&#x27;s sovereignty (introduced 1919)
*&quot;The escutcheon:&quot; (late Middle Ages, reintroduced 1915; see also: Flag of Austria)
*&quot;The mural crown:&quot; Middle class (bourgeoisie, introduced 1919)
*&quot;The sickle:&quot; Farmer&#x27;s class (peasants, introduced 1919)
*&quot;The Hammer:&quot; Working class (introduced 1919)
*&quot;The broken chains:&quot; Liberation from German occupation (added 1945)

Discussions about the arms have been triggered in the past by differing political interpretations, especially by the use of the hammer and the sickle and the broken chains, since the crossed hammer and sickle are a widespread symbol of communism, as is the breaking of chains. Surveys have, however, confirmed that understanding of the actual symbolism of the arms is widespread.

On the one hand the arms serve as a new republican symbol, on the other as a modified version of the historical Habsburg arms. The current version of the arms is often regarded as being reminiscent of the double-headed eagle of the Habsburg monarchy. According to this interpretation, the single headed eagle alludes, in the sense of the removal of the left hand, &quot;Hungarian&quot; head, to the removal of the eastern part of the Habsburg Empire. However, Addendum 202 to the 1919 &quot;Law on the State Arms and the State Seal of the Republic of German Austria&quot; states expressly that the &quot;new&quot; single headed Austrian eagle is based not on the double headed eagle (symbol of the Habsburgs since 1804, and previously of the Holy Roman Empire), but rather on the &quot;symbol of the legions of the Roman Republic&quot;, the Aquila. The Austrian federal states have however retained pre-republican heraldic traditions (mostly heraldic images from the Middle Ages, but also diverse accoutrements such as archducal and ducal hats, and knights&#x27; helmets, &quot;inter alia&quot;).

===The tower emblem as first proposal in 1918 ===

On 31 October 1918, the council of state agreed upon the colours of the republic (red-white-red) as well as the new emblem composed personally by chancellor Karl Renner. The coat of arms was composed quickly due to the need for having a seal at the peace talks after World War I. The emblem consisted of a black tower representing the bourgeoisie, two crossed red hammers representing workers and a golden wreath of wheat representing farmers. The colours black, red and gold was deliberately chosen because they were the national colours of Germany, the three colours associated with republican Germany (as opposed to red, white and black), as first manifested within German lands in 1778.

However, the new emblazon was withdrawn as it was met with heavy criticism from, for example, Adolf Loos and heraldists; the proposal was seen as too similar to commercial advertising. A decision by the council of ministers on 8 May 1919 replaced the tower emblem with the eagle.

<doc id="457050" wikidata="Q6412704" url="?curid=457050" title="Kingdomtide">
<text>Kingdomtide or the Kingdom Season is a liturgical season observed in the autumn by some Anglican and Protestant denominations of Christianity. The season of Kingdomtide was initially promoted in America in the late 1930s, particularly when in 1937 the US Federal Council of Churches recommended that the entirety of the summer calendar between Pentecost and Advent be named &quot;Kingdomtide&quot;. In practice, most denominations that have adopted the Kingdom Season have restricted it to the later autumnal part of Ordinary Time.

==History==
In 1925 Pope Pius XI instituted the Feast of Christ the King throughout the Roman Catholic Church in his encyclical &quot;Quas primas&quot;. From its inception, the celebration resonated with many other denominations, and over the following half a century the same celebration (or a broadly similar one) was introduced to the calendars of many churches of Lutheran, Anglican, Moravian, Methodist, Nazarene, Reformed and United Protestant tradition. The feast was incorporated into the Revised Common Lectionary which became (and remains) the lectionary of a significant proportion of denominations worldwide. The readings appointed for the Sundays leading up to Christ the King all refer to the theme of God&#x27;s Kingdom.

In 1937, the US Federal Council of Churches (a predecessor of the National Council of Churches) recommended that the entire part of the Christian calendar between Pentecost and Advent, commonly called Ordinary Time and ending with Christ the King, be re-named &quot;Kingdomtide&quot;. This proposal met with little support; however, two years later, the Methodist Episcopal Church adopted the term for the second half of this time period, with other Methodist and Presbyterian churches later following the same practice.

Precise criteria for determining when Kingdomtide began varied in different localities. A common practice was to start the season on the Sunday on or nearest August 31, which gave Kingdomtide 13 Sundays every year; in some places, Kingdomtide began on the last Sunday in August, giving the season 13 Sundays in some years and 14 in others. In all cases, the last Sunday of Kingdomtide is observed as the Feast of Christ the King.

By 1992, the United Methodist Church in the United States was believed to be the only denomination still using the term Kingdomtide, and even within the United Methodist Church the observance has now become a minority one. However, around the same time the term Kingdom Season started to be discussed in Anglican liturgical circles.

Towards the end of the twentieth century, and into the early years of the twenty-first century, many Anglican churches issued new liturgies, or in some cases &quot;alternative&quot; liturgies to supplement the traditionally unifying liturgical text, the Book of Common Prayer. Some of these churches have made provision for the marking of a Kingdom Season across the final four Sundays of the liturgical year, stretching from All Saints&#x27; Day to Christ the King.

==Anglican Usage==
With the reduced use of Kingdomtide in the Methodist tradition, the practice is currently most common within certain parts of the Anglican Communion.

In the Church of England, &quot;the period between All Saints&#x27; Day and the First Sunday of Advent is observed as a time of celebration and reflection on the reign of Christ in earth and heaven&quot;. Despite the official nomenclature, this period is commonly named the &quot;Kingdom Season&quot; by those churches choosing to observe it.

In the Church in Wales the Kingdom Season was formally enshrined in the revised &quot;Church in Wales Lectionary&quot; of 2004 and the companion volume &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; published in 2017. The final four Sundays of the year (which follow All Saints&#x27; Day) are officially named the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Sundays of the Kingdom, with the &quot;Fourth Sunday of the Kingdom&quot; also named &quot;Christ the King&quot;. The Times and Seasons publication identifies the Kingdom Season as a subsection of Ordinary Time, and states: &quot;This season of discipleship [Ordinary Time] culminates in the Kingdom Season. A relatively recent season, it arises from the need to provide shape to commemorations focussing on earth and heaven with Christ’s Kingship over all.&quot;

==Liturgical Colour==
The traditional liturgical colour for Ordinary Time is green. Green vestments and paraments are generally also used at church services during Kingdomtide within the United Methodist Church tradition, reflecting the sense of Kingdomtide as a subsection of Ordinary Time.

Although the Church of England also indicates that the Kingdom Season is a subsection of Ordinary Time, and marks it as such in the liturgical calendar published in Common Worship (Times and Seasons) and elsewhere, it encourages the use of red vestments for the days between All Saints Day and Christ the King, to differentiate the period.

<text>The state emblem of Azerbaijan () mixes traditional and modern symbols. The focal point of the emblem is a stylized flame. The flame is a reference to Azerbaijan&#x27;s eternal natural oil-gas resources, which has given it the nickname &quot;land of eternal fire&quot;.

The emblem is supported by a crossed stalk of wheat and an oak bough. Wheat is the symbol of abundance in Azerbaijan. Also, wheat bread is the main staple food. The oak tree is the symbol of power and youth in time.

==History==
The government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic declared a competition on the national emblem of Azerbaijan on 30 January 1920 and made a decision to present the emblem model on May of the same year. However, due to the collapse of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic on 28 April 1920, the emblem was not approved.

The Supreme Mejlis of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic discussed the issue connected with the national emblem and sent a petition to the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR on the declaration of a new competition on the national emblem of Azerbaijan on 17 November 1990.

The competition was declared by the decision of the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan Republic on 5 February 1991. Tens of projects of the emblem were presented during the competition of 1991–1992, and it was also proposed to approve one of the projects developed between 1919–1920.

By the Constitutional Law of the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan Republic, approved on 19 January 1993, one of the projects, developed between 1919–1920 with certain alterations was confirmed the national emblem of Azerbaijan.

==Meaning==
The colours used in composing the emblem are taken from the national flag. The green represents Islam; red represents the development and democracy of Azerbaijan, and blue represents that the Azerbaijanis are a Turkic people. The eight-pointed star (octagram) itself stands for the eight branches of the Turkic peoples, and between each point of the star, there is a smaller yellow circle found.

The National Emblem symbolizes the independence of Azerbaijan. It is the image of an oriental shield and a semicircle formed by the branches of an oak-tree and ears resting on it. The shield contains the image of the word &quot;Allah&quot; written in Arabic in the shape of a fire that draws allusion to Azerbaijan&#x27;s adopted motto, the &quot;land of fire&quot; – in the center of an eight-point star against a background of the colours of the National flag.

==Usage==
The Azerbaijani emblem appears on:
* The residence and the private office of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic;
* The building of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Republic, its conference hall and the private office of the chair of the parliament;
* All courts, buildings of military tribunals, halls of judicial assembly; private offices of the chairs of the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court of the Azerbaijan Republic;
* Buildings of state bodies in cases stipulated in the legislative system of the Azerbaijan Republic;
* Buildings of diplomatic and trade representations and consulates of the Azerbaijan Republic.

<text>The Servarayan hills, with the anglicised name Shevaroy Hills, are a towering mountain range (1620 m) near the city of Salem, in Tamil Nadu state, southern India. 

The local Tamil name comes from a local deity, &quot;Servarayan&quot;.

==Geography==
The Servarayans form part of the southern ranges of the Eastern Ghats System. Shevaroys cover an area of , with plateaus from above sea-level. The main town here is Yercaud. As earlier stated, it also represents the highest peak in southern part of the Eastern Ghats, with the Solaikaradu peak towering to 1620 m above mean sea-level. It is nestled parallel to the lower Chitteri hills - Kalrayan hills, just north of the Kolli Hills and Pachaimalai Hills. Westwards, lie the Mettur hills. This range forms an important link in the southern part of Eastern Ghats hill chain.
==Features==
The Servarayan hills have several old coffee plantations, and a sanatorium. The major areas of tourist interest are the Yercaud Orchidarium of the Botanical Survey of India, and the old coffee estates.

==Flora and fauna==
Some patches of the original forests still exist in the Shevaroy hills and those in higher slopes and peaks contain several endemic species of plants and fauna. The faunal and floral elements high up here have stark similarities to the Western Ghats. Such highlights include &quot;Strobilanthes kunthiana&quot; (Neelakurinji) in the peaks here, which apart from upper reaches of Western Ghats, is not known from the Eastern Ghats elsewhere. Natural forests apart, coffee and citrus fruits, most notably oranges, are grown in abundance, as well as bananas, pears and jackfruit.

Fauna such as gaur, sambar deer, spotted deer, Indian pangolin, jackals, hares, foxes, mangoose, civets, giant squirrels, and many reptiles including endemic ones such &quot;Hemiphyllodactylus aurantiacus&quot;, &quot;Calotes calotes&quot;, &quot;Monilesaurus rouxii&quot;, &quot;Mabuya beddomii&quot; and shield tail snake like &quot;Uropeltis ellioti&quot; and &quot;Uropeltis shorttii&quot; (which is endemic to the hill range), the endangered &quot;Python molurus&quot;, &quot;Rhabdophis plumbicolor&quot;, &quot;Calliophis beddomei&quot; and &quot;Trimeresurus gramineus&quot;; endemic amphibians such as &quot;Hylarana&quot;, &quot;Raorchestes&quot;, &quot;Fejervarya&quot; and scores of birds like the whistling thrush, racket-tailed drongo, peacock, shama, Oriental leafbird and Indian grey hornbill occur in Shevaroy Hills.

<text>[[Comune|[[Italy#Administrative divisions|Administrative divisions of Italy]]]]:[[Regions of Italy|Regions]] (black borders)[[Provinces of Italy|Provinces]] (dark gray borders) (light grey borders)
A  (; : , ) is an administrative division of Italy, roughly equivalent to a township or municipality. It is the third-level administrative division of Italy, after regions () and provinces (). The can also have the title of ().

Formed according to the principles consolidated in medieval municipalities, the is provided for by article 114 of the Constitution of Italy. It can be divided into , which in turn may have limited power due to special elective assemblies.

In the autonomous region of the Aosta Valley, a is officially called a in French.

== Overview ==
The provides essential public services: registry of births and deaths, registry of deeds, and maintenance of local roads and public works. Many have a (), which is responsible for public order duties. The also deal with the definition and compliance with the (), a document that regulates the building activity within the communal area.

All communal structures or schools, sports and cultural structures such as communal libraries, theaters, etc. are managed by the . must have their own communal statute and have a climatic and seismic classification of their territory for the purposes of hazard mitigation and civil protection. also deal with the waste management.

It is headed by a mayor ( or ) assisted by a legislative body, the (), and an executive body, the (). The mayor and members of the are elected together by resident citizens: the coalition of the elected mayor (who needs a relative majority or an absolute majority in the first or second round of voting, depending on the population) gains three fifths of the &#x27;s seats.

The is chaired by the mayor, who appoints others members, called , one of whom serves as deputy mayor (). The offices of the are housed in a building usually called the , or ().

As of January 2021, there were 7,904 in Italy; they vary considerably in size and population. For example, the of Rome, in Lazio, has an area of and a population of 2,758,454 inhabitants, and is both the largest and the most populated.
Atrani in the province of Salerno (Campania) was the smallest by area, with only , and Morterone (Lombardy) is the smallest by population. Many present-day trace their roots along timescales spanning centuries and at times millennia.

The northernmost is Predoi, the southernmost one Lampedusa e Linosa, the westernmost Bardonecchia and the easternmost Otranto. The with the longest name is San Valentino in Abruzzo Citeriore, while the with the shortest name are Lu, Ro, Ne, Re and Vo&#x27;.

The population density of the varies widely by province and region. The province of Barletta-Andria-Trani, for example, has 381,091 inhabitants in 10 , or over 39,000 inhabitants per ; whereas the province of Isernia has 81,415 inhabitants in 52 , or 1,640 inhabitants per —roughly 24 times more communal units per inhabitant.

The coats of arms of the are assigned by decree of the Prime Minister of Italy by the Office of State Ceremonial and Honors, Honors and Heraldry Service (division of the Presidency of the Council born from the transformation of the Royal , eliminated pursuant to the provisions final of the Constitution of Italy).

== Subdivisions ==

Administrative subdivisions within vary according to their population size.

 with at least 250,000 residents are divided into (roughly equivalent to French arrondissements or London boroughs) to which the delegates administrative functions such as the running of schools, social services and waste collection; the delegated functions vary from to . These bodies are headed by an elected president and a local council.

Smaller usually comprise:
* A main city, town or village, that almost always gives its name to the ; such a place is referred to as the (; the French ) of the ; the word is also used in casual speech to refer to the city hall.
* Outlying areas often called (: , abbreviated: ; ), each usually centred on a small town or village. These {{lang|it|frazioni}} usually never had pasts as independent settlements, but occasionally are former smaller {{lang|it|comuni}} consolidated into a larger one. They may also represent settlements which predate the {{lang|it|capoluogo}}. The ancient town of Pollentia (today Pollenzo), for instance, is a {{lang|it|frazione}} of Bra. In recent years the {{lang|it|frazioni}} have become more important due to the institution of the {{lang|it|consiglio di frazione}} ({{literally|fraction council}}), a local form of government which can interact with the {{lang|it|comune}} to address local needs, requests and claims. Even smaller places are called {{lang|it|località}} (abbreviated: {{lang|it|loc.}}; {{literally|localities}}).
* Smaller administrative divisions called {{lang|it|municipi}}, which are similar to districts and neighbourhoods.

Sometimes a {{lang|it|frazione}} might be more populated than the {{lang|it|capoluogo}}; and rarely, owing to unusual circumstances (such as depopulation), the town hall and its administrative functions can be moved to one of the {{lang|it|frazioni}}, but the {{lang|it|comune}} still retains the name of the {{lang|it|capoluogo}}.

In some cases, a {{lang|it|comune}} might not have the same name of {{lang|it|capoluogo}}. In these cases, it is a {{lang|it|comune sparso}} ({{literally| municipality}}) and the {{lang|it|frazione}} which hosts the town hall ({{lang|it|municipio}}) is a {{lang|it|sede municipale}} (compare county seat).

=== Rione ===
{{See also|Rioni of Rome}}
Some towns refer to neighborhoods within a {{lang|it|comune}} as {{lang|it|rione}} ({{IPA|it|riˈoːne|lang}}; {{plural form}}: {{lang|it|rioni}}) or {{lang|it|contrade}}. The term originated from the administrative divisions of Rome, and is derived from the Latin word &quot;regio&quot; ({{plural form}}: &quot;regiones&quot;), &#x27;region&#x27;. All currently extant &quot;rioni&quot; are located in Municipio I of Rome. The term has been adopted as a synonym of {{lang|it|quartiere}} in the Italian {{lang|it|comuni}}. &quot;Terzieri&quot;, &quot;quartieri&quot;, &quot;sestieri&quot;, &quot;rioni&quot;, and their analogues are usually no longer administrative divisions of these towns, but historical and traditional communities, seen especially in towns&#x27; annual Palio.

==== Terziere ====
A {{lang|it|terziere}} ({{plural form}}: {{lang|it|terzieri}}) is a subdivision of several towns in Italy. The word derives from {{wikt-lang|it|terzo}} ({{literally|third}}) and is thus used only for towns divided into three neighborhoods. &quot;Terzieri&quot; are most commonly found in Umbria, for example in Trevi, Spello, Narni and Città della Pieve; towns divided into &quot;terzieri&quot; in other regions include Lucca in Tuscany, and Ancona and Macerata in the Marches. The medieval Lordship of Negroponte, on the island of Euboea, was also divided into three distinct rulerships, which were known as &quot;terzieri&quot;.

==== Quartiere ====
A {{lang|it|quartiere}} ({{IPA|it|kwarˈtjɛːre|lang}}; {{plural form}}: {{lang|it|quartieri}}) is a territorial subdivision, properly used, for towns divided into four neighborhoods ({{lang|it|quarto}}; {{literally|fourth}}) by the two main roads. It has been later used as a synonymous of neighbourhood, and an Italian town can be now subdivided into a larger number of &quot;quartieri&quot;. The Swiss town of Lugano (in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino) is also subdivided into quarters.

The English word &quot;quarter&quot; to mean an urban neighbourhood (e.g. the French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana) is derived from the cognate old French word &quot;quartier&quot;.

==== Sestiere ====

A {{lang|it|sestiere}} ({{plural form}}: {{lang|it|sestieri}}) is a subdivision of certain Italian towns and cities. The word is from {{lang|it|sesto}} ({{literally|sixth}}), so it is thus used only for towns divided into six districts. The best-known example is the &quot;sestieri&quot; of Venice, but Ascoli Piceno, Genoa, Milan and Rapallo, for example, were also divided into &quot;sestieri&quot;. The medieval Lordship of Negroponte, on the island of Euboea, was also at times divided into six districts, each with a separate ruler, through the arbitration of Venice, which were known as &quot;sestieri&quot;. The island of Crete, a Venetian colony (the Kingdom of Candia) from the Fourth Crusade, was also divided into six parts, named after the &quot;sestieri&quot; of Venice herself, while the capital Candia retained the status of a &quot;comune&quot; of Venice. The island of Burano north of Venice is also subdivided into &quot;sestieri&quot;.

A variation of the word is occasionally found: the &quot;comune&quot; of Leonessa, for example, is divided into {{lang|it|sesti}} or sixths.

== Homonymy ==
There are not many perfect homonymous {{lang|it|comuni}}. There are only six cases in 12 {{lang|it|comuni}}:
* Calliano: Calliano, Piedmont and Calliano, Trentino
* Castro: Castro, Apulia and Castro, Lombardy
* Livo: Livo, Lombardy and Livo, Trentino
* Peglio: Peglio, Lombardy and Peglio, Marche
* Samone: Samone, Piedmont and Samone, Trentino
* San Teodoro: San Teodoro, Sardinia and San Teodoro, Sicily

This is mostly due to the fact the name of the province or region was appended to the name of the {{lang|it|comune}} in order to avoid the confusion. Two provincial capitals share the name {{lang|it|Reggio}}: Reggio nell&#x27;Emilia, the capital of the province of Reggio Emilia, in the Emilia-Romagna region, and Reggio di Calabria, the capital of the homonymous metropolitan city, in the Calabria region. Many other towns or villages are likewise partial homonyms (e.g. Anzola dell&#x27;Emilia and Anzola d&#x27;Ossola, or Bagnara Calabra and Bagnara di Romagna).

== Title of city ==

The title of {{lang|it|città}} ({{literally|city}}) in Italy is granted to {{lang|it|comuni}} that have been awarded it by decree of the King of Italy (until 1946) or of the provisional head of state (from 1946 to 1948) or, subsequently, of the President of the Republic (after 1948), on the proposal of the Ministry of the Interior, to which the {{lang|it|comune}} concerned sends an application for a concession, by virtue of their historical, artistic, civic or demographic importance.

The {{lang|it|comuni}} endowed with the title of {{lang|it|città}} usually carry the golden crown above their coat of arms, except with different provisions in the decree approving the coat of arms or in the presence). &quot;The crown of the city ([...]) is formed by a golden circle opened by eight city gates (five visible) with two cordoned walls on the margins, supporting eight towers (five visible) joined by curtain walls, all in gold and black walled.&quot;

<text>The coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point.

==Official description==
The blazon of the coat of arms is described in Bahamas law:

Arms: Upon a representation of the Santa Maria on a base barry wavy of four Azure and Argent on a Chief Azure demisun Or.

Crest: Upon a representation of Our Royal Helmet mantled Azure doubled Argent on a Wreath Or and Azure. A Conch Shell proper in front of a Panache of Palm Fronds proper.

Supporters: On the dexter side a Marlin proper and on the sinister side a Flamingo proper; and upon a Compartment per pale Waves of the Sea and Swampland proper.

Motto: “Forward, Upward, Onward Together”.
==Explanation==
The escutcheon (shield) is supported by a marlin and flamingo. The crest on top of the helm (helmet) is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. Below the helm is the escutcheon itself, whose main charge is a ship, reputed to represent the &quot;Santa María&quot; of Christopher Columbus. It is sailing beneath a sun in the chief. The animals supporting the shield are the national animals, and the national motto is found at the bottom. The flamingo is located upon land, and the marlin upon sea, indicating the geography of the islands. 

The vibrant tinctures of the coat of arms are also intended to point to a bright future for the islands. They are also reputed to have been maintained for their attractiveness to tourists.

The coat of arms was approved by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 December 1971. It was designed by Bahamian artist and clergyman Dr. Hervis L. Bain, Jr., who is also a member of the Order of the British Empire.

==History==

==Island arms==
In addition to the National Coat of Arms, there are a total of eighteen regional island shields (including two unofficial devices). These were granted upon Independence in 1973, to be displayed at the Independence day celebration to reflect each island&#x27;s individual cultural heritage.

<doc id="457061" wikidata="Q188294" url="?curid=457061" title="Coat of arms of Bahrain">
<text>The coat of arms of Bahrain was originally designed in 1932 by Charles Belgrave, the British adviser to the then-Shaikh of Bahrain. The design has undergone slight modifications since then, namely in 1971 and 2002, when mantling and the indentations of the chief were modified respectively, but the influence of the original design is still clearly visible in the modern blazon. The most recent modification happened in 2022 when King Hamad Al-Khalifa issued a decree-law adding the royal crown to the national emblem.

The arms act as a governmental and national symbol in addition to being the personal arms of the king; only the king, however, may display the royal crown ensigning the coat of arms.

==History==
The General Maritime Treaty of 1820 gave Bahrain protected status (not as a protectorate of the United Kingdom). In 1932, the advisor to the Ruler, Charles Belgrave, designed a coat of arms for the Ruler, Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa. The original heraldic achievement was red with a white chief dancetée of three ensigned by an heraldic &quot;ancient crown&quot; of eight points, with five being visible in renditions.
After the United Kingdom withdrew from Bahrain in 1971, red mantling with a white lining was added to the coat of arms as a symbol of the island nation&#x27;s newly acquired independent sovereignty. The mantling is displayed around the shield without a helm or torse, in a manner unusual to traditional heraldic practice. The princely coat of arms still displayed the crown when used as the personal arms of the emir, although the crown was modified to have smaller points displayed between the space of each point. The arms displayed with the mantling sans crown became the arms of dominion for Bahrain.

The heraldic device has been most recently altered in 2002, when the emirate was declared a kingdom by Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa. The shield remains red, but the white chief dancetée now includes five indentations to represent the five pillars of the Muslim faith, rather than the three as was originally assumed in 1932.
The design on the shield is nearly identical to the design of the national flag, the only difference being that the whole of the design is rotated so that the chief of the shield appears as the hoist of the flag.

<doc id="457062" wikidata="Q548814" url="?curid=457062" title="Messerschmitt Me 328">
<text>The Messerschmitt Me 328 was a prototype pulsejet-powered fighter aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt AG.

The Me 328 arose out of design studies for the P.1079 in 1941, having been envisioned as a parasite aircraft that would protect &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bomber formations from Allied fighter aircraft. Being largely composed of wood, the Me 328 was forecast to be several times cheaper than the cost of traditional German fighter aircraft, such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 or Bf 109. It was proposed to use various forms of propulsion, including a single Jumo 004 turbojet engine, either two or four Argus As 014 pulsejets (as used on the V-1 flying bomb), and even as an unpowered glider. The &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS - &quot;German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight&quot;) was also involved in its development.

Making its maiden flight in August 1942, the compact fighter was powered by a pair of As 014 pulsejets. However, these engines were fairly unsuitable, producing excessive resonance, asymmetry, and noise; accordingly, the manned flight programme was suspended after only a few test flights. During its protracted development, a wide variety of other roles were explored for the Me 328; at Adolf Hitler&#x27;s direction, resources were invested into its potential use as a bomber. As the conflict turned increasingly in favour of the Allies, the Me 328 project was resurrected for consideration as a &quot;Selbstopfer&quot; (suicide weapon) aircraft, but was deemed to be unsuitable even for this purpose. None were ever used in an operational capacity.

==History==

===Design===
Work on what would become the Me 328 can be traced back to early 1941 and an approach by the German engine manufacturer Argus Motoren to the aircraft company Messerschmitt AG to inform the latter of its recent advances with pulsejet technology. While the projected 500kg of thrust output was less than the 600kg output projected for early turbojet engines, it was a far lighter engine at 80kg verses 600kg. Messerschmitt was suitably impressed, so that efforts to incorporate the Argus As 014 pulsejet engine into its aircraft designs was promptly initiated; early design work was centered around applying it to the Me 262, which would become the world&#x27;s first production jet fighter. By May 1941, no less than 21 designs had been drafted by the company&#x27;s project office, which had internally designated them as &quot;P.1079&quot;.

A twin-engine arrangement was selected for its greater flight performance, the engine configuration used also permitted the propulsion units to be easily interchanged. Each pulsejet could be individually controlled by the pilot, including a quick-stop function; gauges indicating fuel-flow, fuel capacity, and pressure were present alongside controls for power distribution and safety alongside standard appartus. The cockpit was relatively primitive, although provisions had been made for its replacement by a more well equipped pressurised counterpart without substantial changes to the rest of the aircraft if required. Aviation author Dan Sharp observed that much of the aircraft&#x27;s design appeared to be shaped as to permit as rapid an entry into service as possible as well as to minimise costs. The aircraft&#x27;s construction was to be mainly of wood. A gently swept wing was applied to the aircraft for its favourable high-speed qualities. A relatively simplistic dive brake could also be incorporated. However, even at this stage, the design team expressed their uncertainty over the aircraft&#x27;s stability.

As early as December 1941, discussions with the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM)&quot; (the German Reich Aviation Ministry) considered the P.1079 to be primarily as a fighter aircraft. In such a capacity, it was intended to be deployed as a cost-effective and simplistic escort fighter, to either be towed aloft by a Heinkel He 177 heavy bomber or Junkers Ju 388 using a semi-rigid bar (the &quot;Deichselschlepp&quot;, which was also considered for towing winged auxiliary fuel tanks), or carried on a Me 264 in a &quot;Mistel&quot; type fashion. Three versions of the aircraft were initially proposed: an unpowered glider, a version powered by Argus As 014 pulsejets, and a version powered by a single Jumo 004 turbojet engine. Messerschmitt believed that the type would be capable of performing in several roles ranging from a fighter to aerial reconnaissance, bomber, and interceptor aircraft.

During February 1942, the project was transferred to the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS - &quot;German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight&quot;) for further development. One month later, the Me 328 designation was attached to the aircraft for the first time; that same month, work on producing an initial three prototypes commenced. Shortly thereafter, two versions of the aircraft were proposed, the &quot;Me 328A&quot; (fighter) and the &quot;Me 328B&quot; (bomber); it was estimated that four Me 328s could be built for the cost of a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 or Bf 109 fighter. It was also suggested at one point that it be towed behind the Me 264 heavy bomber for protection. It was envisioned that costs and production difficulties could both be reduced by incorporating as many components as possible from the in-production Me 262 and Me 209 aircraft.

===Prototypes===
Test pilot Hanna Reitsch carried out a test programme on the two prototypes of the glider version, releasing from its carrier aircraft at altitudes of . Ground launches, using both cable-type catapults and rocket-assisted carriages on rails, were successfully conducted. Even with a reduced wingspan, the aircraft demonstrated a very satisfactory performance, and it was planned to build up to 1,000 for use as disposable bombers to be flown by volunteers from 5/KG200, the so-called Leonidas Squadron.

Seven prototypes, each powered by a pair of Argus As 014 pulsejets (as used on the V-1 flying bomb), were built by glider manufacturer Jacobs-Schweyer of Darmstadt. It was intended for use as a fighter aircraft, to be armed with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons. However, during static testing it soon became apparent that it suffered the same problems which were to plague the early development of the V-1 flying bomb - namely, excessive vibration. The first prototype was lost during flight testing in September 1942 during a dive. The engine problems were such that officials came to believe that the project would be difficult to bring to a successful conclusion, and the manned flight programme was suspended in mid-1944, after only a few test flights had been made. Sharp notes a major factor in the Me 328&#x27;s suspension was the superior results from turbojet development, making aircraft that harness them, such as the Me 262, more attractive prospects.

Many of the problems with the aircraft were due to its engines - pulsejet propulsion did not operate effectively at high to medium altitudes (where the majority of combat was anticipated to take place) due to the lower air pressure. Furthermore, these engines also generated a huge amount of noise, allowing observers to hear the aircraft from several miles away, which was not a desirable quality. The excessive vibration produced by the engine would be compounded by the fact that, in a twin-engined configuration, the two pulsejets would run at individual and unique thrust cycles, producing oscillations that would inherently cause instability due to asymmetry as well as resonance. These vibrations were not only harmful to the pilot&#x27;s health, but also threatened the aircraft&#x27;s structural integrity. During September 1943, Willy Messerschmitt and Rudolf Seitz discussed switching the Me 328 to turbojet propulsion. The proposal to fit the Me 328 with a Jumo 004 turbojet was designated as the &quot;Me 328C&quot;.

Despite this, development work continued, incorporating design advances from other Messerschmitt programmes, such as the P.1092 single-jet fighter design proposals. One of the projected Me 328 models produced around this timeframe increased the number of Argus pulsejets to four, the additional pair of engines being mounted below the wings in addition to the original pair positioned on pylons above the rear fuselage. Bomber versions of both types were proposed, and work continued on them at the insistence of Adolf Hitler long after the point when anything other than token use could have been made of them.

During 1944, moves were made to revive the Me 328 again, this time as a piloted flying bomb based on the Me 328B, fitted with a bomb. According to Sharp, Reitsch had advocated for the use of Me 328 project as a suicide weapon, however, the aircraft was not developed with any such use being intended. However, work was dropped in favour of the Fieseler Fi 103R (Reichenberg).

===Proposed roles===
A wide variety of roles were suggested for the aircraft, ranging from a point-defence interceptor, to a version with folding wings and twin pulsejets to be launched from a catapult on a U-boat, to a ground-attack aircraft. It was even believed that the Me 328 could be equipped to undertake aerial refueling. Various modifications to the prototypes were made to evaluate their suitability for these missions, and different engine configurations were tested. Despite all this, the vibration problem simply could not be overcome and the program was abandoned in early 1944, even as production facilities were being readied to construct the aircraft at the Jacobs Schweyer sailplane factory in Darmstadt.

According to the historian Thomas Powers, German officials explored the concept of using the Me 328 as a parasite bomber within the Amerika Bomber program. In this role, a single Me 328 was to be carried by or towed behind either an Me 264 or a Ju 390 to attack New York City. Plans for this tactic — first proposed as much as nine months before Heinkel&#x27;s trans-Atlantic &quot;Amerika Bomber&quot; design competitor received its own RLM designation — were hatched from a meeting between &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erhard Milch and &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Eccard Freiherr von Gablenz at Berlin on 12 May 1942. After release, the Me 328 pilot would release a bomb over Manhattan and then ditch at sea near a U-boat. The idea was dropped in August 1942.

==Variants==
;Me 328 V1 to V10
:Prototypes for the planned Me 328A, with first three built by DFS and Me 328 V1 and V2 first flown in unpowered form and later fitted with Argus As 014 pulsejets. Carried piggy-back on a Dornier Do 217 and Heinkel He 111 and released for flight test, at times by Hanna Reitsch.
;Me 328B V1 to V20
:Twenty prototypes of the Me 328B ordered built Jacobs-Schweyer Flugzeugbau G.m.b.H. (Hans Jacob). Only the Me 328B V1 was completed, while Me 328B V2 was incomplete before war&#x27;s end.
;Me 328A
:The proposed parasite fighter intended for carriage by the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot;,
;Me 328B
:The proposed bomber variant. 280 production vehicles on order but not built.
;Me 328C
:Jumo 004 powered fighter derivative proposed in 1943.

<doc id="457064" wikidata="Q2020004" url="?curid=457064" title="Galois extension">
<text>In mathematics, a Galois extension is an algebraic field extension &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; that is normal and separable; or equivalently, &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; is algebraic, and the field fixed by the automorphism group Aut(&quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot;) is precisely the base field &quot;F&quot;. The significance of being a Galois extension is that the extension has a Galois group and obeys the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.

A result of Emil Artin allows one to construct Galois extensions as follows: If &quot;E&quot; is a given field, and &quot;G&quot; is a finite group of automorphisms of &quot;E&quot; with fixed field &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; is a Galois extension.

The property of an extension being Galois behaves well with respect to field composition and intersection.

==Characterization of Galois extensions==
An important theorem of Emil Artin states that for a finite extension formula_1 each of the following statements is equivalent to the statement that formula_2 is Galois:

*formula_2 is a normal extension and a separable extension.
*formula_4 is a splitting field of a separable polynomial with coefficients in formula_5
*formula_6 that is, the number of automorphisms equals the degree of the extension.

Other equivalent statements are:

*Every irreducible polynomial in formula_7 with at least one root in formula_4 splits over formula_4 and is separable.
*formula_10 that is, the number of automorphisms is at least the degree of the extension.
*formula_11 is the fixed field of a subgroup of formula_12
*formula_11 is the fixed field of formula_14
*There is a one-to-one correspondence between subfields of formula_2 and subgroups of formula_14

An infinite field extension formula_2 is Galois if and only if formula_4 is the union of finite Galois subextensions formula_19 indexed by an (infinite) index set formula_20, i.e. formula_21 and the Galois group is an inverse limit formula_22 where the inverse system is ordered by field inclusion formula_23.

==Examples==
There are two basic ways to construct examples of Galois extensions.

* Take any field formula_4, any finite subgroup of formula_25, and let formula_11 be the fixed field.
* Take any field formula_11, any separable polynomial in formula_7, and let formula_4 be its splitting field.

Adjoining to the rational number field the square root of 2 gives a Galois extension, while adjoining the cubic root of 2 gives a non-Galois extension. Both these extensions are separable, because they have characteristic zero. The first of them is the splitting field of formula_30; the second has normal closure that includes the complex cubic roots of unity, and so is not a splitting field. In fact, it has no automorphism other than the identity, because it is contained in the real numbers and formula_31 has just one real root. For more detailed examples, see the page on the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.

An algebraic closure formula_32 of an arbitrary field formula_33 is Galois over formula_33 if and only if formula_33 is a perfect field.

<text>The National Emblem of Bangladesh () is used by the government of Bangladesh and its agencies. The emblem appears on official government documents and currency.

The emblem was adopted shortly after independence in 1971. In the centre is a water lily, that is bordered on two sides by rice sheaves. Above the water lily are four stars and three connected jute leaves. The water lily is the country&#x27;s national flower, and is representative of the many rivers that run through Bangladesh. Rice represents its presence as the staple food of Bangladesh, and for the agriculture of that nation. The four stars symbolise the four founding principles of the Republic that were enshrined in the Constitution of Bangladesh: nationalism, socialism, democracy, and secularism.

The details of the emblem are inscribed in the constitution:

<text>Fry&#x27;s Food and Drug is a chain of American supermarkets that has a major presence in the U.S. state of Arizona. Fry&#x27;s also operates under the banner of &quot;Fry&#x27;s Marketplace&quot;, a hypermarket or combination of groceries and general merchandise. Fry&#x27;s is a division of Kroger, an American retail company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Fry&#x27;s was founded in 1954 by Donald Fry in El Sobrante, California. A maker placed at the intersection of San Pablo Dam Road and La Colina Rd identifies this spot. With the help of his brother Charles, the chain expanded into the Phoenix market in 1960. Fry&#x27;s was sold in 1972 to Dillons, based in Hutchinson, Kansas. (The sons of Charles Fry used the proceeds from the sale to launch Fry&#x27;s Electronics in 1985; it was otherwise separate from and unaffiliated with the grocery chain.) Dillons merged with Kroger in 1983.

===Fred Meyer and Kroger merger===

In October 1998, Fred Meyer, parent company of Smith&#x27;s Food and Drug based in Salt Lake City, announced a strategic merger with Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Several months later, in May 1999, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved the merger of the two companies, named &quot;The Kroger Co.&quot;

Arizona and Texas were the only two of 31 states where there was an overlap of stores and brands from the merger. The Kroger Co., choosing to operate with one brand in the Arizona market, rebranded most Smith&#x27;s Food &amp; Drug Centers as Fry&#x27;s Food &amp; Drug Stores, though Smith&#x27;s Food and Drug Centers in Kingman, Bullhead City, and Lake Havasu City remained unchanged (perhaps because of their proximity to Nevada and the Las Vegas market, where Kroger retained the Smith&#x27;s brand). Fry&#x27;s Phoenix Distribution Center and administrative offices were moved into the more modern Smith&#x27;s Food and Drug Distribution Center and office space in the west Phoenix suburb of Tolleson.

==Fry&#x27;s Marketplace==

Fry&#x27;s Marketplace is a multi-department store that offers full-service grocery, pharmacy and general merchandise including outdoor living products, electronics, home goods and toys. Ranging in size from , the Marketplace stores are smaller than the original Fred Meyer stores. The Marketplace format was derived from the Fred Meyer concept but on a smaller scale and has since expanded to other Kroger divisions (Ohio, Virginia, Texas, etc.), including the Smith&#x27;s Food &amp; Drug Centers Division in Utah.

Fry&#x27;s Marketplace started out as Smitty&#x27;s, Arizona&#x27;s first multi-department store. Smitty&#x27;s was similar to a Walmart Supercenter (but on a smaller scale) and even had a food court with four branded fast food options (such as Taco Bell). Smitty&#x27;s notably carried the President&#x27;s Choice brand. In 1996, Smitty&#x27;s merged with Smith&#x27;s Food and Drug Centers. In 1997, after the Fred Meyer–Smith&#x27;s merger, Fred Meyer updated and revitalized the Smitty&#x27;s concept (naming the stores Smitty’s Marketplace) and in January 1999, all Smitty&#x27;s stores were renamed Fred Meyer Marketplace, ending the Smitty’s name. During this time, management of Smitty’s changed from Smith&#x27;s Food and Drug to Fred Meyer. Later that year, construction also started on a full size Fred Meyer store in Phoenix, at 35th Avenue and Bethany Home Road, with plans to build more Fred Meyer stores in the Phoenix metro.

In June 2000, Kroger transferred the management of all Fred Meyer stores in Arizona to Fry&#x27;s Food and Drug. The Fred Meyer stores were rebranded as Fry&#x27;s Marketplace, unifying the stores under the Fry&#x27;s brand. The full size Fred Meyer store in Phoenix was completed but never opened and was later demolished to build a Walmart, as the store was too large for Fry&#x27;s to use, with Fred Meyer’s expansion plans for Arizona scrapped.

==Fry&#x27;s Signature==
Fry&#x27;s Signature is marketed as a high-end, neighborhood tailored grocery store. One of the locations is on 20427 North Hayden Road in Scottsdale. Another Fry&#x27;s Signature store is located at 10450 N. 90th Street in Scottsdale. There is also a Fry&#x27;s Signature store at the cross streets of Cave Creek Rd and Carefree Hwy in Cave Creek. In addition, there is a Fry&#x27;s Signature Marketplace at the intersection of Shea Blvd and Tatum Blvd in Phoenix. There is another store located at the cross streets of Gavilan Peak Pkwy and Daisy Mountain Dr in the northern Phoenix suburb of Anthem.

==Fry&#x27;s Mercado==
Fry&#x27;s Mercado is geared towards Arizona&#x27;s large Hispanic market. It is located at 43rd Avenue and McDowell in Phoenix. There is a check cashing store, an agua fresca bar, a cocina (kitchen), and a gas station among other attractions at the location. Several other stores are sublet in the Fry&#x27;s Mercado (including an electronics store, a women&#x27;s clothing store, and a barber shop).

== Fry&#x27;s Fuel ==
Fry&#x27;s offers fuel at some of its retail locations.

<doc id="457090" wikidata="Q3543422" url="?curid=457090" title="Immortus">
<text>Immortus (; Nathaniel Richards) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the future self of Pharaoh Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion, Kang the Conqueror, and Iron Lad / Kid Immortus, and a descendant of the scientist of the same name.

Immortus made his feature film debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023), portrayed by Jonathan Majors.

==Publication history==
Immortus first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #10 and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. In &quot;The Celestial Madonna Saga&quot;, Immortus was retroactively established to be the future self of the time-travelling Pharaoh Rama-Tut and Kang the Conqueror, having turned towards a more peaceful outlook on existence.

==Fictional character biography==
At some point in his personal timeline, Pharaoh Rama-Tut (formerly known as Kang) became weary of battle due to frustration and the loss of his son Marcus and consort Ravonna in several timelines. He was approached by the alien Time-Keepers—time travelers from the end of the universe, the last living creatures in existence—to become their agent, preserving timelines rather than conquering them in exchange for immortality. He accepted and reinvented himself again, this time as Immortus, the lord of the other-dimensional realm of Limbo.

He again came into conflict with the Avengers, but under different circumstances. In his first encounter with the Avengers as Immortus, he attempted the destruction of the Avengers through the use of mythological and historical figures (such as Paul Bunyan, Genghis Khan, Goliath) as combatants after trying to join the Masters of Evil, but being told by Baron Zemo he has to defeat one of the Avengers. The Masters attacked the Avengers after Captain America had been taken to the Tower of London in 1760 where Rick Jones was imprisoned. But when he rescued Rick, he was returned to his own time and with his help the Masters were defeated at a near-win. This event was apparently erased after the Enchantress turns back time to prevent the Avengers capturing the Masters. He was partially responsible for the creation of the Vision, allegedly creating a temporal copy of the original Human Torch that the android Ultron used to create the Vision.

Later, he even allied with Kang the Conqueror in one of Kang&#x27;s schemes against the Avengers and Pharaoh Rama-Tut. He was betrayed by Kang and imprisoned alongside Pharaoh Rama-Tut while Kang used Immortus&#x27;s advanced technology to create the first Legion of the Unliving, made up of now-dead characters taken milliseconds before their death. He was subsequently freed by the Avengers and revealed to be the future persona of Pharaoh Rama-Tut and Kang the Conqueror. He offered to aid the Vision in learning his past. The Legion of the Unliving were defeated and sent back to their own times, and Kang fled.

Later, Immortus officiated at the double wedding of the Vision to the Scarlet Witch, and Mantis to the Swordsman. He next traveled to the Old West with Thor and Moondragon in pursuit of Kang, and assisted the Avengers in the defeat of Kang. Sometime later, he allied with the Space Phantom and the giant Tempus and removed the time travel enchantment from Thor&#x27;s uru hammer with a trick, though Thor can still manipulate time. Later he revealed that he had caused Kang to find his fortress in Limbo, faked his death by leaving what Kang thought were his remains in his fortress, caused the disturbance in the timestream, and had manipulated him into destroying the Kang divergent doubles to stop their effect on the timestream, as they were creating more timelines and duplicates. The Avengers were brought to Limbo by Kang to help him defeat another version. They were captured but escaped. Immortus revealed himself when it appeared only one Kang was left. Immortus also claimed to have mentally manipulated the rescue of Ravonna, who kept his counter-divergency project under observation. When Kang tried to seize a device Immortus held that contained the memories of the slain Kangs and which Immortus claimed made him master of Limbo, he was driven insane and ran into Limbo due to the force of many memories, which all ended in his defeat. Immortus claimed that was Kang&#x27;s chance to redeem and condemn himself and was then questioned by the Avengers on the moral issues of what he had done, but he sent the Avengers back to their own time.

Much later, he was revealed to have a long-term plot for the manipulation of the Avengers. He deleted various time-line universes as part of this plan. His plot to use the Scarlet Witch to become the &quot;absolute master of time&quot; was revealed, and he sent the third Legion of the Unliving to destroy the Avengers. He was rendered catatonic for a time by the Time-Keepers as punishment for his attempt to overthrow their rule. At this time, the original Human Torch was revealed not to be the progenitor of the Vision, though this discovery was later itself claimed to be a deception created by a Space Phantom. Manipulating beliefs regarding the relationship between the Torch and the Vision have been a priority for Immortus due to the Vision&#x27;s connections to the Scarlet Witch, a &#x27;nexus being&#x27; who may have been powerful enough to give birth to children who could threaten some of the most powerful cosmic entities in the universe; disrupting the Witch&#x27;s relationship with the Vision limited the possibility that she would pass on her potential.

Immortus was also responsible for manipulating Iron Man to turn against the Avengers by driving him insane, which resulted in Iron Man&#x27;s death until he was resurrected by Franklin Richards later.

Immortus also came into conflict with his younger self, who was unable to see the reasoning behind Immortus&#x27;s and Rama-Tut&#x27;s actions. Kang&#x27;s conflict with Immortus was dubbed the &quot;Destiny War&quot;, with Kang aiding a group of temporally displaced Avengers from multiple time periods in competing against Immortus&#x27;s schemes, Kang now determined to defy his and Rama-Tut&#x27;s destiny to become Immortus and become the servant of the Time Keepers.

Immortus faked his death several times before ultimately turning on the Time-Keepers to assist the Avengers and, as punishment, was truly killed. He was resurrected minutes later as temporal energies from the Time-Keepers&#x27; attempts to turn Kang directly into Immortus earlier than Rama-Tut had and thus fulfill the time loop caused a backlash—partially due to Kang&#x27;s will and partly due to the complex temporal energies of the current conflict—that created Rama-Tut, Kang, and Immortus as separate beings, freeing Kang from what he saw as a destiny as a &quot;doddering old scholar&quot;.

When the rash actions of Kang caused the timestream to become critically unbalanced, Immortus allied himself with the Next Avengers and future versions of Iron Man and the Hulk in an attempt to undo the damage. Disguising himself as a younger version of Kang, Immortus traveled back to the 21st century and convinced the Avengers to come to the future so that they could understand what had happened. Once the Avengers had successfully restored the timeline, Immortus turned on his allies and killed Iron Man and the Hulk before the youthful Avengers apparently killed him.

==Powers and abilities==
Immortus has no superpowers, but he does possess a genius-level intellect and amassed an extensive knowledge of chronophysics. It is known that he was tutored by the Time-Keepers themselves, due to him being virtually immortal.

==Reception==
In 2022, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Immortus in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Hercules Villains In Marvel Comics&quot; list.

==Other versions==
Immortus appears in the alternate timeline seen in the miniseries &quot;Earth X&quot;, as Pope of the Church of Immortus. The Church of Immortus&#x27;s goals are to destroy Reed Richards&#x27; Human Torches, allowing mankind to keep their mutations. Upon completing this goal, the Church of Immortus would then leave the Earth to colonize the stars. Immortus is advised in his role by a mysterious man known as Mr. Church, who is Mephisto attempting to lead mankind into its own demise.

Initially, Immortus was able to travel into and out of Limbo at his own will, through use of a time machine. Mephisto would eventually use this to get past his inability to travel into Limbo directly and would lock Immortus out of Limbo. Eventually, Immortus would be mutated into Kang by the Terrigen Mists and destroys his time machine in a rage after Mephisto refers to him as Kang, cursing Mephisto for making him Kang again. In his final appearance in the series, he has come to grips with his being Kang, and vows to help Reed Richards undo the damage his Church of Immortus has caused.

==In other media==
===Television===
Immortus makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Beyond Good and Evil Pt. 4: End and Beginning&quot;, voiced by Stephen Ouimette. During the events of the four-part special, he assumes the identity of time-stream &quot;custodial engineer&quot; Bender.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===

<text>Georges René Louis Marchais (; 7 June 1920 – 16 November 1997) was the head of the French Communist Party (PCF) from 1972 to 1994, and a candidate in the 1981 French presidential election.

==Early life==
Born in La Hoguette into a Roman Catholic family, he became a mechanic, just before the beginning of World War II, with the Société Nationale d&#x27;Étude et de Construction de Moteurs d&#x27;Aviation. After the fall of France, he went to Nazi Germany to work in the Messerschmitt aircraft manufacturing plant. He returned to France in May 1943 with forged documents.
In 1946, he became secretary of the metalworkers&#x27; trade union in Issy-les-Moulineaux, and advanced in the &quot;Confédération générale du travail&quot; in his commune from 1951, becoming secretary of the Seine Metallurgical Workers&#x27; Union Federation from 1953 to 1956.

==Political career==
He joined the French Communist Party in 1947. In 1956, he was appointed a member of the extended Central Committee and lead the South-Seine PCF local federation, in the bastion of Maurice Thorez, the historical leader of the Party. Three years later, he became a full member of the Central Committee and of the Politburo. His lightning promotion was explained by his professional origins and his devotion to Thorez. Indeed, he was part of the young guard of the General Secretary which participated to the strengthening of Maurice Thorez&#x27;s leadership, which was covertly disputed by some members of the Politburo (Laurent Casanova and Marcel Servin). In 1961, after the ousting of these, he was nominated secretary for organization. Then, he supported the new General Secretary Waldeck Rochet and in his policy of conciliation with the other left-wing parties. In reaction to the riots of May 1968, in a controversial article published in the party&#x27;s paper &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;, Marchais showed his contempt for Daniel Cohn-Bendit by calling him a &quot;German anarchist&quot;. He accused some students of being &quot;false revolutionaries&quot; coming from the bourgeoisie. From then on, he was one of the personalities intervening in the media in the name of the PCF.

When Rochet fell ill, in 1970, he was promoted junior General Secretary. In fact, he was at this moment the real leader of the PCF. In this, he co-signed the &quot;Common Programme&quot; with the Socialist Party (PS) and the Movement of Left Radicals (MRG) in June 1972. From 1973 to 1997, he was deputy of Val de Marne &quot;département&quot;, a southern Paris suburb.

In December 1972, he became officially General Secretary, following Waldeck Rochet&#x27;s retirement. At first, he pursued the policy of his predecessor in favour of the &quot;Union of the Left&quot;. In this, the PCF sided with François Mitterrand&#x27;s (PS) candidacy in the 1974 presidential election. At the beginning of his mandate of General Secretary, the PCF scored around 20% in the elections. But in mid-1970s, it lost its place of &quot;first left-wing party&quot; to François Mitterrand&#x27;s Socialist Party. At the beginning, he supported reforms in the party, which participated to Eurocommunism with the Italian Communist Party of Enrico Berlinguer and the Spanish Communist Party of Santiago Carrillo and renounced the notion of a dictatorship of the proletariat (22nd congress, 1976). At first, he faced with the reproaches of Soviet leaders. Then, faced with electoral growing of the PS at the expense of his party, he imposed a re-alignment on the Soviet Union at the end of the 1970s. The left-wing parties failed to update their &quot;Common Programme&quot; and lost the 1978 legislative election, even though they were leading in the polls. Outside and inside the party, he was accused of being responsible for this defeat. One year later, he supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979), judged the Communist governments &quot;fairly positive&quot;, and criticized the &quot;right-wing drift&quot; of the Socialist Party. In the 1981 presidential election, he came fourth in the first round, with 15% of votes, thereafter endorsing Mitterrand, who won the second round. He negotiated the entry of four PCF politicians in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy.

In 1984, after President Mitterrand renounced the left&#x27;s &quot;Common Programme&quot; and the electoral sanction in the European Parliament election (only 11% of votes) the PCF&#x27;s ministers resigned from the cabinet. An electoral decline ensued and Marchais faced internal dissent from figures such as Pierre Juquin, Claude Poperen and former ministers as Charles Fiterman. Indeed, some party members, notably among the locally elected, accused him of leading a suicidal strategy. He accused them of plotting with Mitterrand in order to dissolve the PCF in Social Democracy. He let André Lajoinie, leader of the Communist group in the French National Assembly, represent the party in the 1988 presidential election. He was reserved about perestroika. Unlike the Italian Communists, he refused to change the name of the French party after the collapse of the Soviet bloc.

In 1994, at the 28th Congress of the PCF, he ceded his place as General Secretary to Robert Hue, although he maintained his titular role as a member of the Politburo, which was now significantly renamed the National Office. The same year, he became President of the PCF &quot;Comité pour la défense des libertés et droits de l&#x27;homme en France et dans le monde&quot; (&quot;Committee for the defense of human liberties and rights in France and throughout the world&quot;). He criticized the renovation of the party under his successor. He died in 1997.

==Attitudes==

Georges Marchais was a notable personality because of his mannerisms (&quot;Ct&#x27;un scandaaaale&quot; — &quot;This is a scandal!&quot;) and brusque demeanor, often lambasted by comic Thierry Le Luron. He is particularly remembered for an outburst to journalist Jean-Pierre Elkabbach, &quot;Taisez-vous Elkabbach&quot; (&quot;Shut up, Elkabbach!&quot;), which was not actually ever said by Marchais (it was said by Pierre Douglas while imitating Marchais to Thierry Le Luron, who was himself imitating Raymond Barre).

During his TV performances, which stayed in the memory of French audiences, his tone with journalists and opponents was aggressive and humorous. For instance, questioned by Elkabbach and Alain Duhamel about his economic propositions, he answered: &quot;you are privileged, you hold many jobs and make good salaries (in TV, radio, papers...), probably you are concerned by my proposition for a wealth tax, I understand why you don&#x27;t want the change!&quot;
