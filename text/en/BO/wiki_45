<text>A streamliner is a vehicle incorporating in a shape providing reduced air resistance. The term is applied to high-speed railway trainsets of the 1930s to 1950s, and to their successor &quot;bullet trains&quot;. Less commonly, the term is applied to fully faired upright and recumbent bicycles. As part of the Streamline Moderne trend, the term was applied to passenger cars, trucks, and other types of light-, medium-, or heavy-duty vehicles, but now vehicle streamlining is so prevalent that it is not an outstanding characteristic. In land speed racing, it is a term applied to the long, slender, custom built, high-speed vehicles with enclosed wheels.

=== Before World War II ===

==== Europe ====
 


* Germany, 1930: The first high-speed streamliner in Germany was the &quot;Schienenzeppelin&quot;, an experimental propeller-driven single car, built in 1930. On 21 June 1931, the car set a speed record of on a run between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1932 the propeller was removed and a hydraulic system installed. The Schienenzeppelin made in 1933.
** 1932: The Schienenzeppelin led to the construction of the diesel-electric DRG Class SVT 877 &quot;Flying Hamburger&quot;. This two-car train set had 98 seats and a top speed of . In regular service with the Deutsche Reichsbahn, starting on 15 May 1933, this train ran the between Hamburg and Berlin in 138 minutes with an average speed of .
** 1934/1935: The SVT 877 was the prototype for the DRG Class SVT 137, first built in for use in the FDt express train service. In test drives, the SVT 137 &quot;Bauart Leipzig&quot; set a world speed record of in 1936. The fastest regular service with the SVT 137 was between Hannover and Hamm with an average speed of . This service lasted until 22 August 1939.
** 1935: Henschel &amp; Son, a major manufacturer of steam locomotives, introduced the 4-6-4 DRG Class 05 high speed streamliner locomotives for use on the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; Frankfurt am Main to Berlin route. Three examples were built in 1935–36. Built for top speeds of over , the DRG Class 05 locomotives soon proved much faster in test runs. The DRG 05-002 made seven runs in 1935–36 during which it attained top speeds of more than with trains up to weight.
** 11 May 1936: The DRG 05-002 set the world speed record for steam locomotives after reaching on the Berlin–Hamburg line while hauling a train. The locomotive&#x27;s engine power was more than .
** 30 May 1936: The DRG 05-002 set an unbroken start-stop speed record for steam locomotives. During the return run from a test on the Berlin-Hamburg route it did the ~ from Wittenberg to a signal stop before Berlin-Spandau in 48 min 32 s, meaning average between start and stop. The DRG 05-002 was for a time the official holder of the world top speed record for steam locomotives.
* Austria/Poland, 1933: In the 1930s, streamlined Luxtorpeda diesel units that Austrian and later Polish manufacturers constructed were reaching speeds of up to in Poland. 
**1937: The first Polish streamlined steam locomotive Pm36-1 () pulled the Nord Express between Poland and France (Paris). This locomotive was awarded golden medal in the World Expo in Paris in 1937.
* United Kingdom, 1934: Development of streamlined passenger services began in the UK. The Great Western Railway introduced relatively low-speed streamlined railcars (known as &quot;flying bananas&quot;).
**1935 The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) introduced the &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; service using streamlined A4 class steam locomotives and full length trains rather than railcars.
**1937: The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) introduced its &quot;Coronation Scot&quot; service using the Princess Coronation Class streamlined locomotives, achieving a speed of near Crewe on its inaugural run. 
** 1938: The LNER locomotive &quot;Mallard&quot;, which had been built for &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; service, set on a test run a still unsurpassed official record for the highest top speed attained by a steam locomotive .
* Czechoslovakia, 1934: Czechoslovak State Railways ordered two motor railcars with maximum speed . They were constructed by Tatra company, which was producing the first streamlined mass-produced automobile Tatra 77 at that time. The railcar project was led by Tatra chief designer Hans Ledwinka and received streamlined design by Paul Jaray. The railcars were unique thanks to the patented transmission system invented by Josef Sousedík—at lower speeds, it worked like petrol-electric transmission and at around it automatically switched to direct mechanical transmission without any gear. Thanks to this the railcars had good acceleration, low fuel consumption and were easy to drive. Both ČSD Class M 290.0 were delivered in 1936, one of them reached during a test run. They were run on the Czechoslovak prominent route Bratislava-Prague under &quot;Slovenská strela&quot; (Slovak for &quot;Slovak Arrow&quot;) brand.
* Italy, 1934: State-owned railway company Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) developed the FS Class ETR 200, a three-unit electric streamliner. The first of those trains entered revenue service in 1937.
** 6 December 1937: An ETR 200 made a top speed of between Campoleone and Cisterna on the run Rome-Naples. 
** 1939: The ETR 212 made . The journeys from Bologna to Milan were made in 77 minutes, meaning an average of .
* Netherlands, 1934: Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) introduced in the Materieel 34 (DE3), a three unit streamlined diesel-electric trainset. An electric version, Materieel 36, went into service in 1936.
** 1930s: The NS developed in the 1930s a streamlined version of the class 3700/3800 steam locomotive, nicknamed &quot;potvis&quot; (sperm whale).
** 1940: The &quot;Dieselvijf&quot; (DE5), a top speed five unit diesel-electric trainset based on DE3, completed the Dutch streamliner fleet. In test runs, a DE5 ran 
** 1940: The electric was built.
* Soviet Union, 1937: On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet Kolomna Locomotive Works produced two examples of the wind-tunnel designed SŽD series (4-6-4 Whyte Notation) streamliner locomotive for Moscow-Leningrad service. In testing, it was shown capable of speeds greater than — in test ride—and it entered service in 1938. Production of the series was canceled with the onset of World War II.
** 1938: One example of SŽD series (4-6-4 Whyte Notation) express train locomotive, with bullet-like fairing, was produced by Voroshilovgrad Locomotive Works. In 1957 it reached a speed of in test ride, what was the last steam locomotive record in the USSR.

==== United States ====
The earliest known streamlined rail equipment in the United States were McKeen rail motorcars that the company built for the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroads between 1905 and 1917. Most McKeen cars sported a pointed &quot;wind splitter&quot; front, a rounded rear and round porthole style windows in a style that was as much nautically as aerodynamically inspired. The McKeen cars were unsuccessful because the internal combustion drive technology for that application was unreliable at the time. Further, the lightweight frames dictated by the cars&#x27; limited power tended to break. Streamlined rail motorcars would appear again in the early 1930s after the internal combustion-electric propulsion technology that General Electric developed and that the Electro-Motive Company (EMC) promoted became the accepted technology for use in rail motorcars in the 1920s.
Streetcar builders sought to build electric cars with improved speed for interurban lines through the 1920s. In 1931, the J. G. Brill Company introduced the Bullet, a lightweight, wind-tunnel designed car with a rounded front that could run either singly or in multiple-unit sets, capable of speeds over . Although Depression-era economics cut into sales, the design was highly successful in service, lasting into the 1980s.
In 1925, the recently-formed Pullman Car &amp; Manufacturing Corporation experimented with lightweight self-propelled railcars in co-operation with the Ford Motor Company concurrent with Ford&#x27;s development of its Trimotor aircraft. In 1931, Pullman enlisted the services of the Trimotor design contributor William Bushnell Stout to apply airplane fuselage design concepts to railcars. The result was the &quot;Railplane&quot; (not the &quot;Bennie Railplane&quot;), a streamlined self-propelled railcar with a tapered cross-section, lightweight tubular aluminum space frame and duralumin skin. In testing with the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad in 1932, it reportedly reached . The Union Pacific had been seeking improvements to self-propelled railcars based on European design ideas. The performance of the &quot;Railplane&quot; encouraged the railroad to increase its efforts in partnership with Pullman-Standard.
In 1931, the Budd Company reached an agreement with the French tire company Michelin to produce pneumatic-tired rail motorcars in the US, as an improvement on the heavy, underpowered and shimmy-prone &quot;doodlebugs&quot; that ran on American tracks. In that endeavor, Budd would produce lightweight rail equipment utilizing unibody construction and the high strength alloy stainless steel, enabled by shot welding, a breakthrough in electrical welding technique. The venture produced articulated power-trailer car sets with streamlined styling, which left the Budd Company just a (much) more powerful engine away from producing a history-making streamlined trainset.
The Great Depression caused a catastrophic loss of business for the rail industry as a whole and for manufacturers of motorized railcars whose primary markets, branch line services, were among the first to be cut. The interests of lightweight equipment manufacturers and rail operators therefore focused on the development of a new generation of lightweight, high speed, internal combustion-electric powered streamlined trainsets that were primarily designed for mainline service.

The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad (Burlington) and the Union Pacific sought to increase the efficiency of their passenger services by looking to the lightweight, petroleum-powered technology that Budd and Pullman-Standard were developing. The Union Pacific named its project the &quot;M-10000&quot; (designated first as &quot;The Streamliner&quot; and later as the &quot;City of Salina&quot; when in revenue service from 1935 to 1941). The Burlington initially named its first train the &quot;Burlington Zephyr&quot;. The two railroads&#x27; trains each entered service as three-car articulated sets (including the power car). The Winton Engine Corporation, a subsidiary of General Motors (GM), manufactured the engines for both locomotives. The prime mover for the &quot;Burlington Zephyr&quot;&#x27;s diesel-electric propulsion was a new 600 hp diesel engine. The Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;M-10000&quot; had a spark-ignition engine that ran on &quot;petroleum distillate&quot;, a fuel similar to kerosene. The two trainsets were star attractions at the 1934 World&#x27;s Fair (&quot;A Century of Progress&quot;) in Chicago, Illinois. During its set&#x27;s demonstration period, the Union Pacific named the &quot;M-10000&quot; as the &quot;Streamliner&quot;, providing the first use of the term with respect to trains. The &quot;Streamliner&quot;″s publicity tour in February–May 1934 attracted over a million visitors and gained attention in national media as the herald of a new era in rail transportation.

On 26 May 1934, the Burlington&#x27;s &quot;Zephyr&quot; made a record-breaking &quot;Dawn to Dusk&quot; run from Denver, Colorado, to Chicago for its grand entry as a Century of Progress exhibit. The &quot;Zephyr&quot; covered the distance in 13 hours, reaching a top speed of and running an average speed of . The fuel for the run cost US$14.64 at 4¢ per U.S. gallon (equivalent to $ and $ per gallon respectively in after inflation). The Burlington&#x27;s event was covered live on radio and drew large, cheering crowds as the &quot;silver streak&quot; zipped by. Adding to the sensation of the &quot;Zephyr&quot; were the striking appearance of its fluted stainless steel bodywork and its raked, rounded, aerodynamic front end that symbolized its modernity. The train&#x27;s design echoed in steam locomotive styling throughout the following years.
After its Worlds Fair display and a nationwide demonstration tour, the &quot;Zephyr&quot; entered revenue service between Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska, on 11 November 1934. A total of nine &quot;Zephyr&quot; trainsets were built for the Burlington between 1934 and 1939. Each ran as named trains on various Burlington midwestern routes. The Burlington later renamed the &quot;Burlington Zephyr&quot; as the &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot; in honor of that train&#x27;s status as the first of the fleet. In April 1935, two &quot;Twin Cities Zephyrs&quot; that bore the same three-car configuration entered service on the railroad&#x27;s Chicago and Minneapolis-St. Paul route. Larger trainsets with more powerful Winton engines were built for the Burlington and put into service over longer routes. Twin-engine power units and eventually booster power units met the trainsets&#x27; additional power requirements. The Burlington&#x27;s four-car &quot;Mark Twain Zephyr&quot; entered revenue service in October 1935 on the railroad&#x27;s Saint Louis–Burlington, Iowa, route. Two partially-articulated six-car trainsets entered service in May 1936 on the Burlington&#x27;s &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot; route, which connected Chicago and Denver. The Burlington then replaced those sets with a pair of partially-articulated ten-car trainsets in November 1936. The Burlington moved the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;″s six-cat sets to the &quot;Twin Cities Zephyr&quot;, transferring that train&#x27;s original streamlined cars to other Burlington routes.
The last of the classic &quot;Zephyrs&quot; was built for the Burlington&#x27;s Kansas City–Saint Louis &quot;General Pershing Zephyr&quot; route. That trainset, which contained GM&#x27;s newest engine and conventional coupling, entered service in June 1939. The Burlington&#x27;s original &quot;Zephyr&quot; trainsets remained in service in the postwar era. The railroad retired the last of its six-car sets in 1968 after using it as the &quot;Nebraska Zephyr&quot;.
On 31 January 1935, the Union Pacific&#x27;s three-car &quot;M-10000&quot; went into service between Kansas City, Missouri, and Salina, Kansas, as &quot;The Streamliner&quot;. The train subsequently became the &quot;City of Salina&quot; under the railroad&#x27;s naming convention for its expanding fleet of diesel-powered streamliners. The Union Pacific operated the &quot;M-10000&quot; as a three-car set until the railroad was retired the set in 1941. The trainset&#x27;s 1942 scrapping provided Duralumin that was recycled for use in war-time military aircraft.
The Union Pacific also commissioned the construction of five modified trainsets that had evolved from the initial &quot;M-10000&quot; design. Those streamlined trains inaugurated the railroad&#x27;s high-speed service out of Chicago while bearing the names &quot;City of Portland&quot; (June 1935), &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; (May 1936), &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; (June 1936) and &quot;City of Denver&quot; (June 1936). The &quot;M-10001&quot; set had a single power unit that contained a Winton diesel engine. The power unit pulled six tapered low-profile cars that had the form of the original three-car &quot;M-10000&quot; trainset. The &quot;M-10002&quot;″s set consisted of a cab/booster locomotive pulling nine cars of the same form. Automotive-styled cab/booster locomotive sets with engines powered the Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; and &quot;City of Denver&quot; sets. The two &quot;City of Denver&quot; sets started service two cars shorter than the &quot;M-10002&quot; and &quot;M-10004&quot; sets, with roomier and heavier straight-sided cars.
The Union Pacific&#x27;s initial streamliner service to the west coast consisted of five runs monthly for each route. The railroad maintained its daily overnight service on the Chicago–Denver run by assigning three locomotive sets for two trains. The railroad then augmented that stable with locomotive equipment taken from other runs. Despite the breakthrough schedule times of the long-distance M-1000x &quot;City&quot; trains, the records of the Union Pacific&#x27;s fleet reflected the limitations of the locomotives&#x27; technology when meeting the demands of long-distance and higher capacity service. The &quot;M-10001&quot; ran for only 32 months as the &quot;City of Portland&quot; before it was replaced, re-entered service on the Portland–Seattle run and retired in June 1939.

Similarly, the &quot;M-10002&quot; spent 19 months as the Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, 39 months as the &quot;City of Portland&quot; and ten months out of service starting in July 1941. The locomotive then served on the Portland–Seattle run until the railroad took it out of service again in March 1943. After running for 18 months as the &quot;City of San Francisco M-10004&quot;, the locomotive spent six months being refurbished and then served from July 1938 as a second unit on the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;. The Union Pacific retired the locomotive in March 1939. The Union Pacific converted the &quot;M-10001&quot; and &quot;M-10004&quot; power units to additional boosters for the &quot;City of Denver&quot; trains. The train&#x27;s cars then became spare equipment. The two &quot;City of Denver&quot; trainsets (&quot;M–10005&quot; and &quot;M–10006), after cannibalizing power from the &quot;M-10001&quot; and &quot;M-10004&quot;, remained in service until 1953.
Class GG1 electric locomotives brought streamlined styling to the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s fleet of electric locomotives in late 1934. Meanwhile, the Boston and Maine&#x27;s &quot;Flying Yankee&quot;, identical to the original &quot;Zephyr,&quot; entered service between Boston and Portland, Maine, on 1 April 1935.
The Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad &quot;Rebel&quot; trainsets were similar to the &quot;Zephyr&quot; in form, but were not articulated. Designed by Otto Kuhler, the ALCO powered diesel-electrics that the American Car and Foundry Company constructed were placed into service on 10 July 1935.

While streamlining on steam locomotives was more about marketing than performance, newly designed locomotives with state-of-the-art steam technology were able to travel at high speeds. The Milwaukee Road class A Atlantics, built in 1935 to compete with the &quot;Twin Cities Zephyr&quot;, were the first &quot;steamliners&quot; equipped to back up their styled claim to extra speed. In a 15 May 1935 run by locomotive 2 and a dynamometer car, the railroad documented a top speed of . This was the fastest authenticated speed reached by a steam locomotive at the time, making #2 the rail speed record holder for steam and the first steam locomotive to top . That record lasted until a German DRG Class 05 locomotive exceeded it the following year.
The &quot;Illinois Central 121&quot; trainset was the first of the &quot;Green Diamond&quot; streamliners running between Chicago and St Louis. It was a five-unit (including power car) articulated trainset for day service. The Pullman-built set had the same power format and Winton diesel engine as &quot;M-10001,&quot; with some style aspects that resembled the later M1000x trainsets. The Illinois Central ran the 121 trainset on the &quot;Green Diamond&quot; from May 1936 to 1947. After an overhaul, the railroad placed the set on the Jackson Mississippi–New Orleans run until it retired and scrapped the set in 1950. The visual styling of the new trainsets made the existing fleets of locomotives and railcars suddenly look obsolete. Rail lines soon responded by adding streamlined shrouding and varying degrees of mechanical improvement to older locomotives and re-styling heavyweight cars.

The first American steam locomotive to receive that treatment was one of the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s (NYC&#x27;s) J-1 Hudson class locomotives built in 1930, which was re-introduced with streamlined shrouding and named the &quot;Commodore Vanderbilt&quot; in December 1934. The &quot;Vanderbilt&quot; styling was a one-off design by Carl Kantola. The NYC&#x27;s next venture in streamlined styling was Henry Dreyfuss&#x27; 1936 full-length exterior and interior design of the railroad&#x27;s &quot;Mercury&quot; trainsets. Raymond Loewy also designed in 1936 art-deco shrouding with a bullet-front scheme for the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s class K4 locomotives. In 1937, Otto Kuhler used a variation of the bullet-front design on a 4-6-2 locomotive constructed for the Baltimore &amp; Ohio&#x27;s streamlined &quot;Royal Blue&quot;. Henry Dreyfuss used a similar variation for the J-3a &quot;Super Hudsons&quot; that pulled the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; and other NYC express trains.
In 1937, the Milwaukee Road introduced the class F7 Hudsons on the &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot; run. The Hudsons could cruise above and were said to exceed on occasion. Otto Kuhler designed the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s speedsters with &quot;shovel nose&quot; styling. Some of the class 7&#x27;s details were evocative of those of the &quot;Zephyrs&quot;.

Also in 1937, the Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC)—later incorporated into GM&#x27;s Electro-Motive Division (EMD)—started production of streamlined diesel-electric passenger locomotives, incorporating the lightweight carbody construction and raked, rounded front end introduced with the &quot;Zephyr&quot; and the high-mounted, behind-the-nose cab of the M-1000x locomotives. One of the first, EMC&#x27;s TA, was a version produced for the Rock Island Rockets, a series of six lightweight, semi-articulated three and four-car trainsets. EMC/EMD manufactured streamlined E-unit diesel-electric locomotives from 1937 to 1963. These incorporated two features of the earlier EMC 1800 hp B-B development design locomotives, the twin-engine format and multiple-unit control systems that facilitated cab/booster locomotive sets.

The E-units brought sufficient power for full-sized trains such as the B&amp;O &quot;Capitol Limited, the &quot;Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway&#x27;s (AT&amp;SF&#x27;s) &quot;Super Chief,&quot; and the Union Pacific&#x27;s upgraded &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;City of San Francisco,&quot; which challenged steam power in all aspects of passenger service. EMC introduced standardized production to the locomotive industry, with its attendant economies of scale and simplified processes for ordering, producing and servicing locomotives. As a result, EMC was able to offer a variety of support services that decreased technological and initial cost barriers that would otherwise deter conversions to diesel-electric power. With power and reliability of new diesel-electric units improved with the EMC E3 locomotive in 1938, the advantages of diesel became compelling enough for a growing number of rail lines to select diesel over steam for new passenger equipment. The power and top speed advantages of state-of-the-art steam locomotives were more than offset by diesel&#x27;s advantages in service flexibility, downtime, maintenance costs and economic efficiency for most operators.

The American Locomotive Company (ALCO), the builder of the Hiawatha speedsters, saw diesel as the future of passenger service and introduced streamlined locomotives influenced by the design of the E units in 1939. The replacement of steam with diesel power was interrupted by the US entry into World War II, with a military premium on diesel technology that stopped all production of diesel locomotives for passenger service between September 1942 and January 1945.
Streamlined steam locomotives continued to be produced into the early postwar era. Among the most distinctive were the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s duplex-drive 6-4-4-6 type S1 and 4-4-4-4 type T1 locomotives that Raymond Loewy styled. In terms of service longevity, the most successful were the Southern Pacific GS-3 &quot;Daylight&quot; locomotives introduced in 1938 and the Norfolk and Western class J locomotives introduced in 1941. In contrast to designs that completely encased the boiler in shrouding, streamlining of the GS-3/GS-4 series locomotives consisted of skyline casing flush with the smokestack and smoke-lifting skirting along the boiler that left the silver-painted smokebox on full display.

==== Japan ====

The trend of streamliners also came to Japan. In 1934, the Ministry of Railways (Japanese Government Railways, JGR) decided to convert one of its 3-cylinder steam locomotives class C53 into a streamlined style. The selected locomotive was No.43 of class C53. However Hideo Shima, the chief engineer of the conversion, thought streamlining had no practical effect on reducing air resistance, because Japanese trains at that time did not exceed a speed of .

Shima therefore designed the locomotive to create airflow that lifted exhaust smoke away from the locomotive. He had expected no practical effect on reducing air resistance completely, therefore he never tried to test fuel consumption or tractive force of the converted locomotive. The Japanese government planned to use this one converted streamline locomotive on the passenger express route between Osaka and Nagoya.
The converted locomotive gained much popularity from the public. JGR therefore decided to build 21 new streamlined versions of the class C55 locomotive. Additionally, JGR built 3 streamlined class EF55 electric locomotives. Kiha-43000 diesel multiple units and Moha-52 electric multiple units also received a streamlined style.

The South Manchuria Railway, which was under Japanese control at that time, also designed the Pashina class streamlined locomotive. The Railway operated the Asia Express, whose style was coordinated with that of Pashina locomotives.

These streamlined steam locomotives took many man-hours to repair due to their casing. After the outbreak of World War II, the lack of an experienced labor force made the problems worse. As a result, many of the locomotives had their casings removed.

=== Australia around World War II ===
Streamliner locomotives arrived relatively late in Australia. In 1937 streamlined casings were fitted on four Victorian Railways S class locomotives for the Spirit of Progress service between Melbourne and Albury. Similar casings were then fitted on two Tasmanian Government Railways R class narrow-gauge locomotives for the Hobart to Launceston expresses.

Despite — or perhaps because of — the strategic priorities of World War II, some new streamliner locomotives were built in Australia during and immediately after the war. The first five New South Wales C38 class locomotives were modestly streamlined with distinctive conical noses, while the twelve South Australian Railways 520 class locomotives featured extravagant streamlining in the style of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s T1.

In all cases, the streamlining on Australian steam locomotives were purely aesthetic, with negligible impacts on train speeds.

=== After World War II ===

==== Europe ====

In Europe, the streamliner tradition gained new life after World War II. In Germany, DRG Class SVT 137 trains resumed service, but at slower speeds than before the war. Based on the Kruckenberg SVT 137, the Deutsche Bundesbahn&#x27;s (DB&#x27;s) streamlined diesel-electric Class VT 11.5 (later renamed to DB Class 601) built in 1957 was used as the &quot;Trans Europ Express (TEE)&quot; for international high-speed trains.

From 1965, the DB used the streamlined electric locomotives DB Class 103 with regular trains for high-speed service. From 1973, the DB used the DB Class 403, a fully streamlined four-unit electric train with tilting technology. In East Germany, the was built for international express service.

The Swiss SBB and the Dutch NS procured five diesel-electric RAm TEE I (Swiss) and NS DE4 (Dutch) trainsets for Zürich-Amsterdam and Amsterdam-Brussels-Paris services. One set was lost in an accident 1971. The remaining four sets operated as TEE trains until 1974, were transferred to Canada for use on the Ontario Northland Railway (ONR) in 1976. The ONR operated three trains on its Toronto–Moosonee line as the Northlander until 1992.

From 1961, the SBB used for TEE service the RAe TEE II, a set of five streamlined electric trains compatible with four different railway electrification systems. Italy used pre-war trains and new trains that the Italian State Railways—Ferrovie dello Stato (FS)—developed. The new trains included the FS Class ETR 250 (&quot;Arlecchino&quot;), the ETR 300 (&quot;Settebello&quot;), the ETR 401 (&quot;Pendolino&quot;), the ETR 450 (&quot;Pendolino&quot;) and the ETR 500.

Streamliner service temporarily ended in the United Kingdom with the outbreak of WWII. During the war, the LNER and LMS streamlined locomotives had part of their streamlining removed to aid maintenance. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, the state of the railways was improving as deteriorated track conditions caused by delayed maintenance work were corrected. The repairs and new improvements enabled the railways to provide additional mainline trackage for high speed trains.


The first experiments with diesel streamliner services in the United Kingdom were the Blue Pullman trains introduced in 1960 and withdrawn in 1973. These provided luxury business services, but were marginally successful and ran only a little faster than mainstream services. The Blue Pullman was followed by research into streamlined trains and tilting trains, the first to enter passenger service, in 1976, being the diesel powered InterCity 125 (Class 43), followed by the electric, tilting, British Rail Class 370, and Class 91, in combination offering streamlined train services across the United Kingdom.

High-speed service with the electric German ICE 1 (Class 401) began in 1991. The train, which has traveled at speeds of up to in revenue service, broke the speed record that the first DMU &quot;Flying Hamburger&quot; had set 1933 traveling between Hamburg and Berlin.

A TGV high-speed test train set a world record for the fastest wheeled train, reaching in 2007. Conventional TGV services operate at up to on the LGV Est, LGV Rhin-Rhône and LGV Méditerranée. The power cars of the TGV Euroduplex (2N2), which began commercial operations in 2011, have a more streamlined nose than do previous TGVs.

In 2015, &quot;Eurostar&quot; began to operate the electric multiple unit (EMU) British Rail Class 374, also known as the Eurostar e320, on its high-speed services through the Channel Tunnel. The train serves destinations beyond &quot;Eurostar&#x27;s&quot; core routes to the Gare du Nord station in Paris and the Brussels-South railway station. Owned by Eurostar International Limited and capable of operating at , the aluminum trains are sixteen-unit versions of the Siemens Velaro.

==== United States ====
High-speed steam service continued in the United States after World War II, but became increasingly uneconomical. The New York Central&#x27;s Super Hudsons went out of service in 1948 as the line converted to diesel for passenger service. The Milwaukee Road retired its high speed Hiawatha steam locomotives between 1949 and 1951. The last of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s short-lived T1 class locomotives went out of service in 1952. All of those iconic locomotives were scrapped. The last steam streamliners built were three Norfolk and Western class J locomotives in 1950, which operated until 1959.

In 1951, the Interstate Commerce Commission implemented regulations restricting most trains to speeds of or below unless automatic train stop, automatic train control, or cab signalling were installed. The new regulations minimized one of the key advantages of rail travel over the automobile, which became an increasingly attractive alternative as postwar construction of highway systems progressed. Rail operators marketed their services on the basis of luxurious sightseeing, as airlines increasingly competed with rail lines for long-distance travel.

In the mid-1950s, there were several attempts to revive the lightweight custom streamliner concept. None of these projects achieved any lasting impact on passenger service.

The &quot;Train X&quot; project, first promoted by Robert R. Young no later than 1948, resulted in low-profile Baldwin RP-210 locomotives paired with articulated aluminum cars from Pullman-Standard. Two trainsets were built in 1956 for the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Ohio Xplorer&quot; and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Dan&#x27;l Webster&quot;. The pair were problematic and were withdrawn from service by 1960.

GM&#x27;s project, originally called &quot;Train Y&quot;, was marketed as the &quot;Aerotrain&quot;. It featured a futuristic, automotive-styled EMD LWT12 diesel–electric locomotive pulling aluminum coaches adapted from GM&#x27;s long-distance bus design. Two trainsets were produced in 1955 and were trialed by several railroads, but no orders were forthcoming. The two demonstration units were eventually sold to the Rock Island Line, which was already operating an EMD LWT12 paired with Talgo II cars from ACF Industries as the &quot;Jet Rocket&quot;. Rock Island operated them in commuter service until 1966.

The &quot;Speed Merchant&quot; project also produced only two examples. They consisted of Fairbanks-Morse P-12-42 locomotives paired with Talgo II cars from ACF Industries, and were used by the Boston and Maine Railroad for commuter service and by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad&#x27;s &quot;John Quincy Adams&quot;. Both were retired by 1964.

In 1956, the Budd Company produced a single streamlined, lightweight, six car DMU trainset that the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad operated as the &quot;Roger Williams&quot;. After a short period of time in high speed service, the train was split up and the cars were used in service with the New Haven&#x27;s other RDCs.

The advent of jet air travel in the late 1950s brought forth a new round of price competition from airlines for long-distance travel, severely affecting the ridership and profitability of long-distance passenger rail service. Government regulations forced railroads to continue to operate passenger rail service, even on long routes where, the railroads argued, it was almost impossible to make a profit.

Unlike air and automotive infrastructure, which federal and state governments subsidize, operating revenues entirely support privately-owned rail infrastructure in the United States. By the late 1960s, most rail operators were therefore seeking to completely discontinue passenger service.

The lightweight custom streamliner concept was revived again in the 1960s with the UAC TurboTrain. These articulated trainsets used gas turbine engines instead of reciprocating diesel engines for traction power. They were operated by Penn Central and then Amtrak from 1969 to 1976, and in Canada by Canadian National and then Via Rail from 1969 to 1982.

Some GG1 electric locomotives that the Pennsylvania Railroad once operated remained in service until 1983. The last EMD E-units in regular service were retired in 1993.

Amtrak has operated nearly all long-distance passenger rail systems in the United States since 1971. The publicly-financed rail company&#x27;s quest for greater fuel efficiency has led them to acquire and operate GE Genesis diesel-electric locomotives. In so doing, Amtrak reintroduced the lightweight, aerodynamic carbody construction that the &quot;Zephyr&quot; had pioneered in the 1930s.

Since 2000, Amtrak has operated high-speed &quot;Acela&quot; (named &quot;Acela Express&quot; until 2019) passenger trains that travel at speeds of up to in the Boston - Washington, D.C. Northeast Corridor. State governments and others in many areas throughout the United States have considered the construction of new high-speed lines, but rail travel is much less common in the U.S. than in Europe or Japan.

In 2008, California voters approved bonds to initiate construction of the California High-Speed Rail line, which would connect the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central Valley and Southern California. Construction of the first segment, between Bakersfield and Merced in the Central Valley, began in 2015.

==== Preserved examples (United States) ====

After 26 years of service and traveling over , the &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot; went to Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry. The &quot;Flying Yankee&quot;, the third streamliner to enter service, is undergoing restoration to operational condition. The &quot;Silver Charger&quot; locomotive of the &quot;General Pershing Zephyr&quot; trainset remained in service until 1966 and is also undergoing restoration.

In December 1974, the streamlined steam-powered Southern Pacific 4449 &quot;Daylight&quot; came off an outdoor public display to undergo a restoration and re-painting that enabled it pull the &quot;American Freedom Train&quot;, which toured the 48 contiguous United States as part of the nation&#x27;s 1976 Bicentennial celebration. With the exception of occasional interruptions for maintenance and inspections, the restored locomotive has operated in excursion service throughout that area since 1984.

The twice-restored streamlined Norfolk and Western Railway&#x27;s steam-powered class J1 locomotive Number 611 operated in excursion service within the United States from 1982 to 1994 and from 2015 to 2017. The locomotive has traveled for display at special events.

Examples of the pre-World War II &quot;slant nose&quot; EMC EA, E3, E5, and E6 locomotives are on display at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum, the North Carolina Transportation Museum, the Illinois Railway Museum, and the Kentucky Railway Museum. The stainless steel clad E5 is occasionally matched with one of the original &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot; car sets for excursion service. As of 2017, the Rock Island No.630 E6 unit was under restoration for display in Iowa.

The EMD LWT12 locomotives and several passenger cars of GM&#x27;s two &quot;Aerotrains&quot; are presently on display within the United States. The National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin now exhibits the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Aerotrain&quot; locomotive No.2 and two passenger cars. The National Museum of Transportation in Kirkwood, Missouri (near St. Louis) exhibits the Rock Island&#x27;s locomotive No.3 and two passenger cars.

==== Japan ====
After World War II, Japanese railroads favored multiple unit trains, even on their mainlines. In 1949, the Japanese National Railways (JNR) released the 80 series EMUs for use on long-distance trains. Lead coaches of the 80 series built after 1950 incorporated a streamlined design.

In 1957, Odakyu Electric Railway released the 3000 series EMUs. The exterior design was developed using a wind tunnel intended for aircraft.

An Odakyu 3000 set a world railway speed record of for a narrow-gauge train. Multiple unit trains were thus shown to be suitable for long-distance trains by the JNR Series 80 and for high-speed trains by the Odakyu 3000.

These experiences led to the development of the first Shinkansen, the 0 Series. The Odakyu 3000 strongly influenced the 0 series, which was also developed using a wind tunnel.

The lead coaches of the 0 series were developed using a Douglas DC-8 for a reference. At a speed of , the aerodynamic style of the 0 series &quot;bullet train&quot; had a substantial effect on reducing air resistance.

In 2020, the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) began operating the N700S, the most recent addition to the N700 Series Shinkansen. The 16-car train reached its design speed of in trials conducted in 2019 on the Tokaido Shinkansen.

The JR Central is presently developing and testing the L0 series high-speed maglev train. The JR Central plans to use the streamlined train on the Chūō Shinkansen railway line between Tokyo and Nagoya, which is under construction. The railroad expects to open the line in 2027 and to later extend it to Osaka.

A seven-car L0 series train set a world railway speed record of in 2015. The railway plans to operate the train at a maximum speed of when in revenue service. The train&#x27;s speed would exceed that of the world&#x27;s fastest commercial electric train, the Chinese Shanghai maglev, whose cruising speed is .

=== High speed train services today ===
Worldwide many, if not most, high speed passenger trains are now streamlined. Speeds continue to rise as high-speed rail services become the normal long-distance rail service.

=== Specific trainsets ===
=== Streetcars and high-speed interurbans ===
Early versions of the PCC (Presidents’ Conference Committee) streetcars were referred to as &quot;Streamliners&quot; in North America. However, aerodynamic research appeared much earlier on the interurban scene, i.e. among the forerunners of the recent light rail. In 1905, the Electric Railway Test Commission started a series of test runs to develop a carbody design that would reduce wind resistance at high speeds.

Vestibule sections of different shapes were suspended independent of the carbody, with a dynamometer to measure the resistance of each. Over 200 test runs were made at speeds up to with parabolic, wedge, standard, and flat vestibule ends.

The test results indicated that a parabolic-shaped front end reduced wind resistance at high speeds below that of the conventional rounded profile. However, with that time&#x27;s heavy railcars and moderate speeds, no significant operating economies were realized. Streamlining was discarded for another quarter-century.

From the 1920s, however, stronger alloys, lightweight metals, and better design were all used to reduce carbody weight—which in turn permitted the use of smaller bogies and motors with corresponding economies in power consumption. In 1922, the G. C. Kuhlman Car Company built ten lightweight cars for the Western Ohio Railway.

After an elaborate wind tunnel investigation, the first in the railway industry, the J. G. Brill Company made in 1931 its first Bullet railcars, capable to speeds above . With 52 seats, they weighed only 26 tons. Some remained in use for almost 60 years.

== Buses ==
Many buses adopted a stylish streamline look in the 1930s with tests showing that streamlined design reduced fuel costs.

Starting in 1934, Greyhound Lines worked with the Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company for its Series 700 buses, first for &quot;Series 719&quot; prototypes in 1934, and from 1937 as the exclusive customer for Yellow&#x27;s &quot;Series 743&quot; buses. Greyhound named these the &quot;Super Coach&quot; and purchased a total of 1,256 between 1937 and 1939.

General Motors also custom-built twelve streamlined Futurliners for its 1936 &quot;Parade of Progress&quot; and, later the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and traveling exhibits. The popular two-level GMC PD-4501 Scenicruiser, which GM manufactured for Greyhound Lines between 1954 and 1956, exemplified the further streamlining that occurred in the company&#x27;s bus designs in the years that followed World War II.

==Automobiles==
Beginning in the 1910s, engineers tried to incorporate aerodynamics into the shape of automobiles. Some such cars entered production.

===Experimental and prototype vehicles===

== Bicycles and tricycles==

Bicycle fairings help to streamline the vehicle and the rider. Human powered upright and recumbent bicycles and tricycles termed velomobiles that are partially or completely enclosed for aerodynamic advantage and weather protection take streamlining even further. Although many velomobiles are recreational, two-wheeled velomobiles have set a number of cycling speed records.

== Ships ==
 The Streamline Moderne–style automobile/passenger ferry &quot;MV Kalakala&quot; received its streamlining during a 1933–1935 reconstruction. The ship operated in Puget Sound near the northwestern coast of the U.S. state of Washington until 1967. It was scrapped in 2015.

== Sterling Streamliner diners ==
Many American roadside diners built since the 1930s have had streamlined exteriors and interiors. In 1939, Roland Stickney designed a diner named the &quot;Sterling Streamliner&quot;. Built by the John B. Judkins Company, a firm that also made custom car bodies, the prefabricated diner&#x27;s production ceased in 1942 at the beginning of American involvement in World War II.

The rounded shapes of one or both ends of the &quot;Sterling Streamliner&quot; diners resembled the sloping curved nose of the &quot;Burlington Zephyr&quot;&#x27;s streamlined silver locomotive. 
One such &quot;Sterling Streamliner&quot; with two rounded ends was built in 1940 and installed as the &quot;Jimmy Evans Flyer&quot; in New Bedford, Massachusetts. In the 1960s, the building was moved to the village of Pocasset in the town of Bourne, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, where it was named the &quot;My Tin Diner&quot;.
In 2000, an arsonist severely damaged the &quot;My Tin Diner&quot; when he set it on fire. In 2003, the structure was moved into a field next to the &quot;Handy Hill Creamery&quot; near Hix Bridge Road in Westport, Massachusetts, while plans were being made to restore it to working condition. However, although restoration began, it was not completed. Visible from the Road, the derelict structure was the only &quot;Sterling Streamliner&quot; with two rounded ends known to still survive in 2019.

Only one &quot;Sterling Streamliner&quot; was open for business in 2020: the Modern Diner in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. That structure, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, has both a rounded sloped end and a flat vertical end. Although the building&#x27;s roof was once silver, it is now maroon.

<text>The Johnstown Flood, sometimes referred to locally as Great Flood of 1889, occurred on Friday, May 31, 1889, after the catastrophic failure of the South Fork Dam, located on the south fork of the Little Conemaugh River, upstream of the town of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States. The dam ruptured after several days of extremely heavy rainfall, releasing 14.55 million cubic meters of water. With a volumetric flow rate that temporarily equaled the average flow rate of the Mississippi River, the flood killed 2,208 people and accounted for in damage.

The American Red Cross, led by Clara Barton and with fifty volunteers, undertook a major disaster relief effort. Support for victims came from all over the U.S. and eighteen foreign countries. After the flood, survivors suffered a series of legal defeats in their attempts to recover damages from the dam&#x27;s owners. This led in the 20th century to American law changing from a fault-based regime to one of strict liability.

The events have been commemorated nationally as well as locally. The Johnstown Flood National Memorial was established in 1964. The National Historic Landmark District of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was established in 1986. Both are administered by the National Park Service.

==History==

The city of Johnstown, Pennsylvania was founded in 1800 by Swiss immigrant Joseph Johns (anglicized from &quot;Schantz&quot;) where the Stonycreek and Little Conemaugh rivers joined to form the Conemaugh River. It began to prosper with the building of the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal in 1836.

Construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Cambria Iron Works in the 1850s brought further industry to town, and eventually led to abandonment of the canal. By 1889, Johnstown&#x27;s industries had attracted numerous Welsh and German immigrants to work. With a population of 30,000, it was a growing industrial community known for the quality of its steel.

The high, steep hills of the narrow Conemaugh Valley and the Allegheny Mountains to the east restricted development of Johnstown, keeping it close to the riverfront areas. The valley received large amounts of runoff from rain and snowfall. The area surrounding the city is prone to flooding due to its location on the rivers, whose upstream watersheds include an extensive drainage basin of the Allegheny plateau. Adding to these factors, slag from the iron furnaces of the steel mills was dumped along the river to create more land for building and narrowed the riverbed. Developers&#x27; artificial narrowing of the riverbed to maximize early industries left the city even more flood-prone.

Immediately downstream of Johnstown, the Conemaugh River is hemmed in by steep mountainsides for about . A roadside plaque alongside Pennsylvania Route 56, which follows this river, proclaims that this stretch of valley is the deepest river gorge in North America east of the Rocky Mountains.

===South Fork Dam and Lake Conemaugh===
High above the city, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania built the South Fork Dam between 1838 and 1853 as part of a cross-state canal system, the Main Line of Public Works. Johnstown was the eastern terminus of the Western Division Canal, supplied with water by Lake Conemaugh, the reservoir behind the dam.

As railroads superseded canal barge transport, the Commonwealth abandoned the canal and sold it to the Pennsylvania Railroad. The dam and lake were part of the purchase, and the railroad sold them to private interests.

Henry Clay Frick led a group of Pittsburgh speculators, including Benjamin Ruff, to purchase the abandoned reservoir, modify it, and convert it into a private resort lake at a property for their wealthy associates. Many were connected through business and social links to Carnegie Steel.

Development included lowering the dam to make its top wide enough to hold a road for a carriageway and putting a fish screen in the spillway. Workers lowered the dam, which had been high, by . These alterations are thought to have increased the vulnerability of the dam. Moreover, a system of relief pipes and valves, a feature of the original dam which had previously been sold off for scrap, was not replaced. The club had no way of lowering the water level in the lake in case of an emergency.

The Pittsburgh speculators built cottages and a clubhouse to create the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, an exclusive and private mountain retreat. Membership grew to include more than fifty wealthy steel, coal, and railroad industrialists. Lake Conemaugh at the club&#x27;s site was in elevation above Johnstown. The lake was about long, about wide, and deep near the dam. The dam was high and long.

==Events of the flood==



On May 28, 1889, a low-pressure area formed over Nebraska and Kansas. By the time this weather pattern reached western Pennsylvania two days later, it had developed into what would be termed the heaviest rainfall event that had ever been recorded in that part of the U.S. The United States Army Signal Corps estimated that of rain fell in 24 hours over the region. During the night of May 30, small creeks became roaring torrents, ripping out trees and debris. Telegraph lines were downed and rail lines were washed away. Before daybreak, the Little Conemaugh River and Stoney Creek, which form the main stem of the Conemaugh River at their confluence in Johnstown, were threatening to overtop their banks.

On the morning of May 31, in a farmhouse on a hill just above the South Fork Dam, Elias Unger, president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, awoke to the sight of Lake Conemaugh swollen after a night-long heavy rainfall. Unger ran outside in the still-pouring rain to assess the situation and saw that the water was nearly cresting the dam. He quickly assembled a group of men to save the face of the dam by trying to unclog the spillway, where an iron grate and a broken fish trap had become obstructed with debris from the swollen waterline. Other men tried digging a ditch at the other end of the dam, on the western abutment which was lower than the dam crest. The idea was to let more water out of the lake to try to prevent overtopping of the crest in the center, where the dam was structurally weakest, but the effort was unsuccessful. Most men remained on top of the dam, some plowing earth to raise the crest above the water, while others tried to pile mud and rock on the face to save the eroding wall.

John Parke, an engineer for the South Fork Club, briefly considered cutting through the dam&#x27;s end near the abutments, where the pressure would be less, in order to create another spillway, but eventually decided against it as doing so would have quickly ensured the failure of the dam. Twice, under orders from Unger, Parke rode on horseback to a telegraph office in the nearby town of South Fork to send warnings to Johnstown explaining the dangerous situation unfolding at the dam. Parke did not personally take a warning message to the telegraph tower – he sent a man instead. The warnings ultimately were not passed to the authorities in Johnstown, however, as there had been many false alarms in the past of the dam not holding against flooding, and most people felt the danger was not serious enough to warrant urgent delivery of the messages. Unger, Parke, and the rest of the men continued working until exhaustion to save the face of the dam; they abandoned their efforts at around 1:30 pm, fearing that their efforts were futile and recognizing that the dam was at risk of imminent collapse. Unger ordered all of his men to fall back to high ground on both sides of the dam where they could do nothing but watch and wait. During the day in Johnstown, the situation worsened as water levels rose to as high as in the streets, trapping some people in their houses.

Between 2:50 and 2:55 pm the South Fork Dam breached. Lidar analysis of the Lake Conemaugh basin reveals that it contained 14.55 million cubic meters (3.843 billion gallons) of water at the moment the dam collapsed. Witnesses reported that the lake took only 35–45 minutes to empty completely after the dam began to fail, though modern dam-breach computer modeling reveals that it likely took approximately 65 minutes for most of the lake to empty. The first town to be hit by the flood was South Fork, immediately downstream; the town was on high ground, and most of the people escaped by running up the nearby hills when they saw the dam spill over. Between twenty and thirty houses were destroyed or washed away, and four people were killed.

Continuing on its way downstream to Johnstown, by river to the west, the water picked up debris such as trees, houses, and animals. At the Conemaugh Viaduct, a railroad bridge, the flood was momentarily stemmed when debris jammed against the stone bridge&#x27;s arch. But within seven minutes, the viaduct collapsed, allowing the flood to resume its course. Owing to the delay at the stone arch, the flood waters gained renewed hydraulic head, resulting in a stronger, more abrupt wave of water hitting places downstream than otherwise might have been expected. The small town of Mineral Point, below the viaduct, was the first populated place to be hit with this renewed force. About thirty families lived on the village&#x27;s single street. After the flood, there were no structures, no topsoil, no subsoil in Mineral Point – only the bedrock was left. The death toll here was approximately sixteen people. In 2009, studies showed that the flood&#x27;s flow rate through the narrow valley exceeded , comparable to the flow rate of the Mississippi River at its delta, which varies between .

The village of East Conemaugh was the next populated area to fall victim to the flood. One witness on high ground near the town described the water as almost obscured by debris, resembling &quot;a huge hill rolling over and over&quot;. From his idle locomotive in the town&#x27;s railyard, engineer John Hess heard and felt the rumbling of the approaching flood. Throwing his locomotive into reverse, he raced backward toward East Conemaugh, the whistle blowing constantly. His warning saved many people who reached high ground. When the flood hit, it picked up the still-moving locomotive off the tracks and floated it aside; Hess himself survived, but at least fifty people died, including about twenty-five passengers stranded on trains in the village.

Just before reaching the main part of Johnstown, the flood surge hit the Cambria Iron Works in the town of Woodvale, sweeping up railroad cars and barbed wire. Of Woodvale&#x27;s 1,100 residents, 314 died in the flood. Boilers exploded when the flood hit the Gautier Wire Works, causing black smoke seen by Johnstown residents. Miles of barbed wire became entangled with the rest of the debris in the flood waters.

Fifty-seven minutes after the dam collapsed, the flood reached Johnstown. Residents were caught by surprise as the wall of water and debris bore down, traveling at speeds of and reaching a height of in places. Some people, realizing the danger, tried to escape by running towards high ground, but most were hit by the surging floodwater in their homes and workplaces. Many people were crushed by pieces of debris, and others became caught in barbed wire from the wire factory upstream. Those who reached attics or roofs, or managed to stay afloat on pieces of floating debris, waited hours for help to arrive.

The Stone Bridge, a substantial arched structure, carried the Pennsylvania Railroad across the Conemaugh River in the center of Johnstown. The debris carried by the flood, now including twisted steel rails, boxcars, entire buildings, and the bodies of the flood&#x27;s victims, formed a temporary dam at the bridge, forcing the flood surge to roll upstream along the channel of the Stoney Creek River. Eventually, gravity caused the surge to return to the dam, resulting in a second wave that hit the city from a different direction. Some people who had been washed downstream became trapped in an inferno as the debris that had piled up against the bridge caught fire; at least eighty people died there. The fire burned for three days. After floodwaters receded, the pile of debris at the bridge was seen to cover , and reached in height. It took workers three months to remove the mass of debris, the delay owing in part to the huge quantity of barbed wire from the ironworks entangled with the wreckage. Dynamite was eventually used.

== Victims ==

The total death toll from the flood was calculated originally as 2,209 people, making the disaster the largest loss of civilian life in the U.S. at the time. This number of deaths was later surpassed by fatalities in the 1900 Galveston hurricane and the September 11 attacks. However, as pointed out by historian David McCullough, a man reported as presumed dead had survived; Leroy Temple returned to Johnstown eleven years after the disaster and revealed he had extricated himself from the flood debris at the Stone Bridge, walked out of the valley, and moved to Beverly, Massachusetts. After the revelation of Temple&#x27;s survival, the official death toll was 2,208.

According to records compiled by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, bodies were found as far away as Cincinnati, Ohio, and as late as 1911; 99 entire families died in the flood, including 396 children; 124 women and 198 men were widowed; 98 children were orphaned; and one third of the dead, 777 people, never were identified; their remains were buried at Johnstown&#x27;s Grandview Cemetery.

== Investigation ==

On June 5, 1889, five days after the flood, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) appointed a committee of four prominent engineers to investigate the cause of the disaster. The committee was led by the esteemed James B. Francis, a hydraulic engineer best known for his work related to canals, flood control, turbine design, dam construction, and hydraulic calculations. Francis was a founding member of the ASCE and served as its president from November 1880 to January 1882. The committee visited the site of the South Fork Dam, reviewed the original engineering design of the dam and modifications made during repairs, interviewed eyewitnesses, commissioned a topographic survey of the dam remnants, and performed hydrologic calculations.

The ASCE committee completed their investigation report on January 15, 1890, but its final report was sealed and not shared with other ASCE members or the public. At ASCE&#x27;s annual convention in June 1890, committee member Max Becker was quoted as saying, &quot;We will hardly [publish our investigation] report this session, unless pressed to do so, as we do not want to become involved in any litigation.&quot; Although many ASCE members clamored for the report, it was not published in the society&#x27;s transactions until two years after the disaster, in June 1891. William Shinn, a former partner of industrialist Andrew Carnegie, became the new president of ASCE in January 1890. He gave the investigation report to outgoing Becker to decide when to release it to the public. Becker kept it under wraps until the time of ASCE&#x27;s convention in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1890. The long-awaited report was presented at that meeting by James Francis. The other three investigators, William Worthen, Alphonse Fteley, and Max Becker, did not attend.

In its final report, the ASCE committee concluded the dam would have failed even if it had been maintained within the original design specifications, i.e., with a higher embankment crest and with five large discharge pipes at the dam&#x27;s base. This claim has since been challenged. A hydraulic analysis published in 2016 confirmed that the changes made to the dam by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club severely reduced its ability to withstand major storms. Lowering the dam by as much as and failing to replace the discharge pipes at its base cut the dam&#x27;s safe discharge capacity in half. This fatal lowering of the dam greatly reduced the capacity of the main spillway and virtually eliminated the action of an emergency spillway on the western abutment. Walter Frank first documented the presence of that emergency spillway in a 1988 ASCE publication. Its existence is supported by topographic data from 1889 which shows the western abutment to be about one foot lower than the crest of the dam remnants, even after the dam had previously been lowered as much as three feet by the South Fork Club. Adding the width of the emergency spillway to that of the main spillway yielded the total width of spillway capacity that had been specified in the 1847 design of William Morris, a state engineer.

== Legal ==
In the years following the disaster, some survivors blamed the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club for their modifications to the dam that lowered its level and gradually blocked a spillway. They were also accused of failing to maintain the dam properly, so that it was unable to contain the additional water of the unusually heavy rainfall.

The club was successfully defended in court by the firm of Knox and Reed (later Reed Smith LLP), whose partners Philander Knox and James Hay Reed were both club members. Knox and Reed successfully argued that the dam&#x27;s failure was a natural disaster which was an Act of God. No legal compensation was ever paid to the survivors of the flood.

Neither the club nor its members was ever held legally responsible for the disaster. This perceived injustice is considered to have aided the acceptance, in later cases, of a new definition of &quot;strict, joint, and several liability,&quot; so that even a &quot;non-negligent defendant could be held liable for damage caused by the unnatural use of land.&quot;

Individual members of the South Fork Club, millionaires in their day, contributed to the recovery in Johnstown. Along with about half of the club members, co-founder Henry Clay Frick donated thousands of dollars to the relief effort. After the flood, Andrew Carnegie built the town a new library.

Popular feeling ran high, as is reflected in Isaac G. Reed&#x27;s poem:
==Aftermath==

The Johnstown Flood was the worst flood to hit the U.S. in the 19th century, and to date, the worst to strike Pennsylvania. 1,600 homes were destroyed, $17 million in property damage levied (approx. $550 million in 2022), and of downtown Johnstown were completely destroyed. Debris at the Stone Bridge covered thirty acres, and clean-up operations were to continue for years. Cambria Iron and Steel&#x27;s facilities were heavily damaged; they returned to full production within eighteen months.

Working seven days and nights, workmen built a wooden trestle bridge to temporarily replace the Conemaugh Viaduct, which had been destroyed by the flood. The Pennsylvania Railroad restored service to Pittsburgh, away, by June 2. Food, clothing, medicine, and other provisions began arriving by rail. Morticians traveled by railroad. Johnstown&#x27;s first call for help requested coffins and undertakers. The demolition expert &quot;Dynamite Bill&quot; Flinn and his 900-man crew cleared the wreckage at the Stone Bridge. They carted off debris, distributed food, and erected temporary housing. At its peak, the army of relief workers totaled about 7,000.

One of the first outsiders to arrive was Clara Barton, the founder and president of the American Red Cross. Barton arrived on June 5, 1889, to lead the group&#x27;s first major disaster relief effort; she did not leave for more than five months. Donations for the relief effort came from all over the U.S. and overseas. $3,742,818.78 was collected for the Johnstown relief effort from within the U.S. and 18 foreign countries, including Russia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and the Ottoman Empire.
===Subsequent floods===
Floods have continued to be a concern for Johnstown, which had major flooding in 1894, 1907, 1924, 1936, and 1977. The biggest flood of the first half of the 20th century was the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day flood of March 1936. That flood also reached Pittsburgh, where it was known as the Pittsburgh Flood of 1936. Following the 1936 flood, the United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged the Conemaugh River within the city and built concrete river walls, creating a channel nearly deep. Upon completion, the Corps proclaimed Johnstown &quot;flood free&quot;.

The new river walls withstood Hurricane Agnes in 1972, but on the night of July 19, 1977, a severe thunderstorm dropped of rain in eight hours on the watershed above the city and the rivers began to rise. By dawn, the city was under water that reached as high as . Seven counties were declared a disaster area, suffering $200 million in property damage, and 78 people died. Forty were killed by the Laurel Run Dam failure. Another 50,000 were rendered homeless as a result of this &quot;100-year flood&quot;. Markers on a corner of City Hall at 401 Main Street show the height of the crests of the 1889, 1936, and 1977 floods.

== Legacy ==

At Point Park in Johnstown, at the confluence of the Stonycreek and Little Conemaugh rivers, an eternal flame burns in memory of the flood victims.

The Carnegie Library in Johnstown is now operated by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association. It has adapted it for use as the Johnstown Flood Museum.

Portions of the Stone Bridge have been made part of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial. This includes a park and was established in 1969 and managed by the National Park Service. In 2008, the bridge was restored in a project including new lighting as part of commemorative activities related to the flood.

Supporters of the memorial also believed it was important to gain control over the remaining buildings and property of the former South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, in order to have full interpretation. The area and contributing buildings were designated as the National Historic Landmark District in 1986 and added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is also administered by the National Park Service.

Combined with the failure of the Walnut Grove Dam less than a year later, the Flood brought national attention to the issue of dam safety.

===Effect on the development of American law===

Survivors of the flood were unable to recover damages in court because of the South Fork Club&#x27;s ample resources. First, the wealthy club owners had designed the club&#x27;s financial structure to keep their personal assets separated from it and, secondly, it was difficult for any suit to prove that any particular owner had behaved negligently. Though the former reason was probably more central to the failure of survivors&#x27; suits against the club, the latter received coverage and extensive criticism in the national press.

As a result of this criticism, in the 1890s, state courts around the country adopted &quot;Rylands v. Fletcher&quot;, a British common law precedent which had formerly been largely ignored in the United States. State courts&#x27; adoption of &quot;Rylands&quot;, which held that a non-negligent defendant could be held liable for damage caused by the unnatural use of land, foreshadowed the legal system&#x27;s 20th-century acceptance of strict liability.

<doc id="454916" wikidata="Q662511" url="?curid=454916" title="Propafenone">
<text>Propafenone, sold under the brand name Rythmol among others, is a class 1c anti-arrhythmic medication, which is used to treat illnesses associated with rapid heart beat such as atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.

==Mechanism of action==
Propafenone works by slowing the influx of sodium ions into the cardiac muscle cells, causing a decrease in excitability of the cells. Propafenone is more selective for cells with a high rate, but also blocks normal cells more than class Ia or Ib anti-arrhythmic medications. Propafenone differs from the prototypical class Ic antiarrhythmic in that it has additional activity as a beta-adrenergic blocker which can cause bradycardia and bronchospasm.

==Metabolism==
Propafenone is metabolized primarily in the liver. Because of its short half-life, it requires dosing two or three times daily to maintain steady blood levels. The long-term safety of propafenone is unknown. Because it is structurally similar to another anti-arrhythmic medicine, flecainide, similar cautions should be exercised in its use. Flecainide and propafenone, like other antiarrhythmic drugs have been shown to increase the occurrence of arrhythmias (5.3% for propafenone, Teva physician prescribing information), primarily in patients with underlying heart disease. However, their use in structurally normal hearts is considered safe.

==Side effects==
Side effects attributed to propafenone include hypersensitivity reactions, lupus-like syndrome, agranulocytosis, CNS disturbances such as dizziness, lightheadedness, gastrointestinal upset, a metallic taste and bronchospasm. About 20% of patients discontinued the drug due to side effects.

==Initiation of therapy==
Propafenone generally needs to be started in a hospital setting to assure ECG monitoring of the patient. There are many different dosages of propafenone, depending on clinical presentation of the arrhythmia. The treatment is generally begun with a relatively high dose (450–900 mg/d), decreasing to near 300 mg/d. In most Western countries, the accepted maximal dose is 900 mg/d.

For economic and convenience reasons, some clinicians are starting certain antiarrhythmic agents in an outpatient setting for some patients. No consensus exists regarding the safety of this practice, and information is needed to determine which agents and which patients are appropriate for outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic therapy. From a clinical point of view, this drug is used primarily in patients with relatively preserved myocardial function.

==Contraindications and cautions==
Caution should be used in administering propafenone in individuals with hepatic dysfunction, asthma, congestive heart failure, or bradycardia.

==History==
Propafenone was approved for use in the United States in November 1989.

==Stereochemistry==
Propafenone contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, a 1:1 mixture of (&quot;R&quot;)– and (&quot;S&quot;)–forms:

<doc id="454925" wikidata="Q2303209" url="?curid=454925" title="Slipstream">
<text>A slipstream is a region behind a moving object in which a wake of fluid (typically air or water) is moving at velocities comparable to that of the moving object, relative to the ambient fluid through which the object is moving. The term slipstream also applies to the similar region adjacent to an object with a fluid moving around it. &quot;Slipstreaming&quot; or &quot;drafting&quot; works because of the relative motion of the fluid in the slipstream.

==Overview==
A slipstream created by turbulent flow has a slightly lower pressure than the ambient fluid around the object. When the flow is laminar, the pressure behind the object is higher than the surrounding fluid. The shape of an object determines how strong the effect is. In general, the more aerodynamic an object is, the smaller and weaker its slipstream will be. For example, a box-like front (relative to the object&#x27;s motion) will collide with the medium&#x27;s particles at a high rate, transferring more momentum from the object to the fluid than a more aerodynamic object. A bullet-like profile will cause less turbulence and create a more laminar flow.

A tapered rear will permit the particles of the medium to rejoin more easily and quickly than a truncated rear. This reduces lower-pressure effect in the slipstream, but also increases skin friction (in engineering designs, these effects must be balanced).

==Slipstreaming==

The term &quot;slipstreaming&quot; describes an object travelling inside the slipstream of another object (most often objects moving through the air though not necessarily flying). If an object is following another object, moving at the same speed, the rear object will require less power to maintain its speed than if it were moving independently. This technique, also called drafting, can be used by bicyclists.
*Following in the slipstream of another motor vehicle, or &quot;drafting&quot;, allows for significantly improved fuel efficiency due to reduced atmospheric drag. Truck convoys are a common example, travelling highways in a single-file queue several vehicles long. In tests, this has been shown to produce significant fuel savings. Auto racing drivers also draft in order to conserve fuel, the better to gain competitive advantage by reducing the frequency of fuel stops or, more often, to reach a higher speed before pulling out to attempt to overtake another driver for example, a driver tries to overtake the leading driver so he follows the rear of the leading driver, the rear driver will gain slipstream causing the whole vehicle to gain more speed than the leading driver.
*A related effect used for lift rather than drag reduction is vortex surfing for airborne objects. The extended formations (V formation) or &quot;&quot; in which many migratory birds (especially geese) fly enable the birds (except, of course, the bird at the front) to use vortex surfing to take advantage of one another&#x27;s vortices. Other birds (for example cormorants) that typically fly in close formation, even on short journeys, are probably also exploiting this effect. Using wingtip devices to reduce induced drag caused by wingtip vortices has been tested for aircraft, and could save 10%–29% fuel.

== Spiral slipstream ==

Spiral slipstream, also known as propwash, &quot;prop wash&quot;, or &quot;spiraling slipstream&quot;, is a spiral-shaped slipstream formed behind a rotating propeller on an aircraft. The most noticeable effect resulting from the formation of a spiral slipstream is the tendency to yaw nose-left at low speed and full throttle (in centerline tractor aircraft with a clockwise-rotating propeller.) This effect is caused by the slipstream acting upon the tail fin of the aircraft: The slipstream causes the air to rotate around the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, and this air flow exerts a force on the tail fin, pushing it to the right. To counteract this, some aircraft have the front of the fin (vertical stabilizer) slightly offset from the centreline so as to provide an opposing force that cancels out the one produced by the slipstream, albeit only at one particular (usually cruising) speed, an example being the Hawker Hurricane fighter from World War II.

Propeller slipstream causes increased lift by increasing the airspeed over part of the wings. It also reduces the stall speed of the aircraft by energizing the flow over the wings.

<text>In mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a positive linear functional on an ordered vector space formula_1 is a linear functional formula_2 on formula_3 so that for all positive elements formula_4 that is formula_5 it holds that
formula_6

In other words, a positive linear functional is guaranteed to take nonnegative values for positive elements. The significance of positive linear functionals lies in results such as Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem.

When formula_3 is a complex vector space, it is assumed that for all formula_8 formula_9 is real. As in the case when formula_3 is a C*-algebra with its partially ordered subspace of self-adjoint elements, sometimes a partial order is placed on only a subspace formula_11 and the partial order does not extend to all of formula_12 in which case the positive elements of formula_3 are the positive elements of formula_14 by abuse of notation. This implies that for a C*-algebra, a positive linear functional sends any formula_15 equal to formula_16 for some formula_17 to a real number, which is equal to its complex conjugate, and therefore all positive linear functionals preserve the self-adjointness of such formula_18 This property is exploited in the GNS construction to relate positive linear functionals on a C*-algebra to inner products.

== Sufficient conditions for continuity of all positive linear functionals ==

There is a comparatively large class of ordered topological vector spaces on which every positive linear form is necessarily continuous. 
This includes all topological vector lattices that are sequentially complete. 

Theorem Let formula_19 be an Ordered topological vector space with positive cone formula_20 and let formula_21 denote the family of all bounded subsets of formula_22 
Then each of the following conditions is sufficient to guarantee that every positive linear functional on formula_19 is continuous:
# formula_24 has non-empty topological interior (in formula_19). 
# formula_19 is complete and metrizable and formula_27 
# formula_19 is bornological and formula_24 is a semi-complete strict formula_30-cone in formula_22 
# formula_19 is the inductive limit of a family formula_33 of ordered Fréchet spaces with respect to a family of positive linear maps where formula_34 for all formula_35 where formula_36 is the positive cone of formula_37

== Continuous positive extensions ==

The following theorem is due to H. Bauer and independently, to Namioka. 

:Theorem: Let formula_19 be an ordered topological vector space (TVS) with positive cone formula_39 let formula_40 be a vector subspace of formula_41 and let formula_2 be a linear form on formula_43 Then formula_2 has an extension to a continuous positive linear form on formula_19 if and only if there exists some convex neighborhood formula_46 of formula_47 in formula_19 such that formula_49 is bounded above on formula_50

:Corollary: Let formula_19 be an ordered topological vector space with positive cone formula_39 let formula_40 be a vector subspace of formula_54 If formula_55 contains an interior point of formula_24 then every continuous positive linear form on formula_40 has an extension to a continuous positive linear form on formula_22

:Corollary: Let formula_19 be an ordered vector space with positive cone formula_39 let formula_40 be a vector subspace of formula_41 and let formula_2 be a linear form on formula_43 Then formula_2 has an extension to a positive linear form on formula_19 if and only if there exists some convex absorbing subset formula_67 in formula_19 containing the origin of formula_19 such that formula_49 is bounded above on formula_71

Proof: It suffices to endow formula_19 with the finest locally convex topology making formula_67 into a neighborhood of formula_74 

== Examples ==

Consider, as an example of formula_12 the C*-algebra of complex square matrices with the positive elements being the positive-definite matrices. The trace function defined on this C*-algebra is a positive functional, as the eigenvalues of any positive-definite matrix are positive, and so its trace is positive.

Consider the Riesz space formula_76 of all continuous complex-valued functions of compact support on a locally compact Hausdorff space formula_22 Consider a Borel regular measure formula_78 on formula_79 and a functional formula_80 defined by formula_81 Then, this functional is positive (the integral of any positive function is a positive number). Moreover, any positive functional on this space has this form, as follows from the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem.

== Positive linear functionals (C*-algebras) ==

Let formula_40 be a C*-algebra (more generally, an operator system in a C*-algebra formula_83) with identity formula_84 Let formula_85 denote the set of positive elements in formula_43

A linear functional formula_87 on formula_40 is said to be if formula_89 for all formula_90 
:Theorem. A linear functional formula_87 on formula_40 is positive if and only if formula_87 is bounded and formula_94

=== Cauchy–Schwarz inequality ===

If formula_87 is a positive linear functional on a C*-algebra formula_96 then one may define a semidefinite sesquilinear form on formula_83 by formula_98 Thus from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality we have 
formula_99

== Applications to economics ==
Given a space formula_24, a price system can be viewed as a continuous, positive, linear functional on formula_24.

<doc id="454936" wikidata="Q2627013" url="?curid=454936" title="Positive operator">
<text>In mathematics (specifically linear algebra, operator theory, and functional analysis) as well as physics, a linear operator formula_1 acting on an inner product space is called positive-semidefinite (or &quot;non-negative&quot;) if, for every formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4, where formula_5 is the domain of formula_1. Positive-semidefinite operators are denoted as formula_7. The operator is said to be positive-definite, and written formula_8, if formula_9 for all formula_10.

Many authors define a positive operator formula_11 to be a self-adjoint (or at least symmetric) non-negative operator. We show below that for a complex Hilbert space the self adjointness follows automatically from non-negativity. For a real Hilbert space non-negativity does not imply self adjointness.

In physics (specifically quantum mechanics), such operators represent quantum states, via the density matrix formalism.

== Cauchy–Schwarz inequality ==

Take the inner product formula_12 to be anti-linear on the &quot;first&quot; argument and linear on the second and suppose that formula_11 is positive and symmetric, the latter meaning that formula_14.
Then the non negativity of 
:formula_15
for all complex formula_16 and formula_17 shows that 
:formula_18
It follows that formula_19 If formula_1 is defined everywhere, and formula_21 then formula_22

== On a complex Hilbert space, if an operator is non-negative then it is symmetric ==
For formula_23 the polarization identity

:formula_24
and the fact that formula_25 for positive operators, show that formula_26 so formula_1 is symmetric.

In contrast with the complex case, a positive-semidefinite operator on a real Hilbert space formula_28 may not be symmetric. As a counterexample, define formula_29 to be an operator of rotation by an acute angle formula_30 Then formula_31 but formula_32 so formula_1 is not symmetric.

== If an operator is non-negative and defined on the whole Hilbert space, then it is self-adjoint and bounded ==
The symmetry of formula_1 implies that formula_35 and formula_36 For formula_1 to be self-adjoint, it is necessary that formula_38 In our case, the equality of domains holds because formula_39 so formula_1 is indeed self-adjoint. The fact that formula_1 is bounded now follows from the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem.

This property does not hold on formula_42

== Partial order of self-adjoint operators ==
A natural partial ordering of self-adjoint operators arises from the definition of positive operators. Define formula_43 if the following hold:

# formula_1 and formula_45 are self-adjoint
# formula_46

It can be seen that a similar result as the Monotone convergence theorem holds for monotone increasing, bounded, self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces.

== Application to physics: quantum states ==

The definition of a quantum system includes a complex separable Hilbert space formula_47 and a set formula_48 of positive trace-class operators formula_49 on formula_47 for which formula_51 The set formula_48 is &quot;the set of states&quot;. Every formula_53 is called a &quot;state&quot; or a &quot;density operator&quot;. For formula_54 where formula_55 the operator formula_56 of projection onto the span of formula_57 is called a &quot;pure state&quot;. (Since each pure state is identifiable with a unit vector formula_54 some sources define pure states to be unit elements from formula_59 States that are not pure are called &quot;mixed&quot;.

<text>The Henschel Hs 123 was a single-seat biplane dive bomber and close-support aircraft flown by the German aircraft manufacturer Henschel. It was the last biplane to be operated by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

The Hs 123 started development in 1933 in response to a request for a single-seat biplane dive bomber. Henschel&#x27;s design team opted to produce an aircraft with all-metal construction, relatively clean lines and a high level of manoeuvrability. Its principal competitor was the Fieseler Fi 98, which was eventually cancelled when the Hs 123 proved to be more promising. On 1 April 1935, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; a total of four prototypes were produced, the fourth of which featured strengthened centre-section struts after two of the earlier prototypes were lost due to structural failures during high speed dives. 

Upon its introduction to &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in autumn 1936, the Hs 123 quickly displaced the Heinkel He 50 biplane, but was only viewed as being a &quot;stop-gap&quot; measure until the arrival of the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; later that same decade. In 1938, the type was dispatched to Spain to fight with the &quot;Legion Condor&quot; in the Spanish Civil War; the type reportedly performed well in this theatre, particularly in terms of the psychological impact of its attacks upon the enemy. The Spanish Nationalists was impressed with the type and opted to procure additional aircraft for their own use. The temporarily-organized 15th Squadron of the China Central Air Force Academy Group also flew combat missions with its Hs 123s around this time, attacking Imperial Japanese warships along the Yangtze River.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; opted to dispatch the type during the early and middle portions of the Second World War, first deploying it during the Polish Campaign. In 1940, the type saw action in the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; attacks through the Netherlands, Belgium and France and the early portion of the Balkans Campaign. Numerous Hs 123s saw combat during the start of Invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. The Hs 123 proved to be relatively robust, durable and effective in combat, especially in severe conditions (such as those present in the Eastern Front); it was commonly modified in the field to carry additional machine guns, more armour, and various other changes. It continued to see front-line service until 1944, only to be withdrawn due to a lack of serviceable airframes and spare parts (production ended in the Autumn of 1938).

==Design and development==
Henschel was a German locomotive manufacturer. Soon after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Henschel decided to start designing aircraft, one of the first being the Hs 123. This aircraft was designed to satisfy the a requirement issued in 1933 by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM). This requirement sought a new dive bomber to equip the newly-established &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;; it was specified that this aircraft should have a biplane configuration and provide only a single seat for the pilot. Henschel and rival firm Fieseler, who responded with the Fi 98, competed for the same requirement.

In comparison to the Fi 98, the Hs 123 was noticeably more streamlined and possessed relatively clean lines. In terms of its general configuration, it was a sesquiplane, whereby the lower wings were significantly smaller than the top wings. The aircraft featured all-metal construction, both the fuselage and fixed tail surfaces had a light alloy covering while the majority of the wings were also metal skinned; in contrast, every control surface and the rear portion of both wings had a fabric covering. The design eliminated the use of bracing wires, instead relying on single faired interplane struts. The Hs 123 was also outfitted with cantilever main landing gear legs that were attached directly to the smaller stub-like lower wings.

On 1 April 1935, the first prototype, the Hs 123 V1, performed its maiden flight. During its first public demonstration flight, which was conducted on 8 May 1935, it was piloted by &quot;Generalluftzeugmeister&quot; Ernst Udet, a First World War ace. The first three Henschel prototypes, the first and third of which were powered by 485 kW (650 hp) BMW 132A-3 engines while the second by a 574 kW (770 hp) Wright Cyclone, were tested at Rechlin in August 1935. Only the first prototype had &quot;smooth&quot; cowlings; from that point on, all aircraft had a tightly fitted cowling that included 18 fairings covering the engine valves. The third prototype was the first to carry armaments.

The performance of the Hs 123 V1 prototype was such that it quickly eliminated any prospect for the more conventional Fi 98 being awarded the contract; further work was promptly cancelled after a sole prototype had been constructed. During flight testing, the Hs 123 proved to be capable of pulling out of &quot;near-vertical&quot; dives, however, two of the first three prototypes subsequently crashed due to structural failures in the wings that occurred when the aircraft was being flown in a high-speed dive. Accordingly, the fourth prototype incorporated improvements to rectify these problems, the principal change being the adoption of sturdier centre-section struts.

Following the completion of all remaining tests, the Hs 123 was ordered into production with a 656 kW (880 hp) BMW 132Dc engine. During the summer of 1936, the first production standard aircraft came off the assembly lines, which had been established at Henschel&#x27;s Schönefeld and Johannisthal facilities. The Hs 123 was intended to replace the Heinkel He 50 biplane reconnaissance and dive bomber as well as to function as a &quot;stop-gap&quot; measure until the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; became available. As such, production was limited and no upgrades was seriously considered.

However, Henschel opted to work on an improved version, the &quot;Hs 123B&quot;, during 1938. A proposal to fit the aircraft with a more powerful 716 kW (960 hp) &quot;K&quot;-variant of its BMW 132 engine did not proceed beyond the prototype stage, the Hs 123 V5. The &quot;V6&quot; prototype fitted with a similar powerplant and featuring a sliding cockpit hood was intended to serve as the &quot;Hs 123C&quot; prototype. In total, 265 aircraft are believed to have been produced. Production of the Hs 123A was terminated in Autumn 1938. A prototype Hs 123B and a prototype Hs 123C were produced just prior to production of the Hs 123A ended.

The majority of Hs 123s were delivered to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. However, several Hs 123s were exported to China while 14 were transferred to Spain&#x27;s Nationalist Air Arm; both operators would use their aircraft in combat.

==Operational history==

===Initial operations===
During 1936, a small pre-production batch of &quot;Hs 123A-0&quot;s was completed and used for service evaluation by the Luftwaffe. This initial group was followed by the slightly modified &quot;Hs 123A-1&quot; series, the first production examples. The service aircraft flew with an armoured headrest and fairing in place (a canopy was tested in the Hs 123V6) as well as removable main wheel spats and a faired tailwheel. The main weapon load of four SC50 50 kg (110 lb) bombs could be carried in lower wing racks along with an additional SC250 250 kg (550 lb) bomb mounted on a &quot;crutch&quot; beneath the fuselage. The usual configuration was to install an auxiliary fuel &quot;drop&quot; tank at this station that was jettisoned in emergencies. Two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns were mounted in the nose synchronized to fire through the propeller arc.

The aircraft entered service at StG 162 in autumn 1936. Its career as a dive bomber was cut short when the unit received its first Ju 87A during the following year. The remaining Hs 123s were incorporated into the temporary &quot;Fliegergeschwader&quot; 100 at the time of the Munich Crisis. The &quot;Geschwader&quot; (wing) had been created as an emergency measure, equipped with obsolete aircraft and tasked with the ground attack role. With the signing of the Munich Agreement on 30 September 1938, the crisis was over and the &quot;Geschwader&quot; was disbanded, the &quot;gruppen&quot; being transferred to other established units. By 1939, despite its success in Spain, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; considered the Hs 123 to be obsolete and the &quot;schlachtgeschwader&quot; (close-support wings) had been disbanded with only one &quot;gruppe&quot;, &quot;II.(Schl)/LG2&quot; still equipped with the Hs 123.

===Spanish Civil War===
During the same time, at the request of &quot;Oberst&quot; (later &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;) Wolfram von Richthofen, chief of staff of the &quot;Legion Condor&quot;, five aircraft had been deployed to Spain in early 1937 as a part of the &quot;Legion Condor&quot;, intended to be used as tactical bombers.

In their intended role, the Hs 123s proved to be somewhat of a failure, hampered by their small bomb capacity and short range. Instead, the Hs 123s based in Seville were used for ground support, a role in which their range was not such a detriment, and where the ability to accurately place munitions was more important than carrying a large load. The combat evaluation of the Hs 123 demonstrated a remarkable resiliency in close-support missions, proving able to absorb a great deal of punishment including direct hits on the airframe and engine. The Nationalists in Spain were impressed with the Hs 123&#x27;s performance in battle, purchasing the entire evaluation flight and ordering an additional 11 aircraft from Germany. The Spanish Hs 123s were known as &quot;Angelito&quot; (dear angel or little angel), and at least one Hs 123 was in service with the &quot;Ejército del Aire&quot; (Spanish Air Force) after 1945.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
Twelve Hs 123s that were originally ordered by Portugal were exported to China. They were extensively used as dive bombers by the temporarily-organized 15th Squadron of the China Central Air Force Academy Group, operating against Imperial Japanese warships along the Yangtze River, especially during 1938.

=== Second World War ===
==== Service from Poland to Greece ====
At the outbreak of hostilities, the surviving 39 Hs 123s assigned to II. (Schl)/LG 2, were committed to action during the Polish Campaign. This single unit proved to be particularly effective. Screaming over the heads of enemy troops, the Hs 123s delivered their bombs with devastating accuracy. A frightening aspect of an Hs 123 attack was the staccato noise of its engine that a pilot could manipulate by changing rpm to create &quot;gunfire-like&quot; bursts. The Hs 123 proved to be quite rugged and capable of absorbing a high amount of damage while continuing to fly. Operating from primitive bases close to the front lines, the type was considered by ground crews to be easy to maintain and reliable in field conditions.

The Polish campaign was a success for the Hs 123 in spite of it being considered obsolete by several figures within &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; high command. Within a year, the Hs 123 was again in action in the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; attacks through the Netherlands, Belgium and France. During one noteworthy engagement on 22 May 1940, the two &quot;gruppen&quot; equipped with the type held off an attacking force of around 40 tanks against their own forward base in Cambrai.

General Heinz Guderian was continually impressed by the quick turnaround time offered by II.(Schl)/LG 2. Often positioned as the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s most-forward based combat unit, the Hs 123 flew more missions per day than other units, and again proved their worth in the close-support role. With Ju 87s still being used as tactical bombers rather than true ground support aircraft and with no other aircraft capable of this mission in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; arsenal the Hs 123 was destined to continue in service for some time, although numbers were constantly being reduced by attrition. While the Hs 123 proved to be particularly effective against ground attacks, they were vulnerable to enemy fighter interception.

The Hs 123 was not employed in the subsequent Battle of Britain as the English Channel proved an insuperable obstacle for the short-ranged aircraft. The sole operator, II.(Schl)/LG 2 went back to Germany to re-equip with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter bomber (&quot;Jabo&quot;) variant. The Bf 109E fighter bomber was not capable of carrying any more bombs than the Hs 123, however, it did have a greater range and was far more capable of defending itself. It did have some downsides, including the notoriously tricky taxiing, ground handling, and takeoff/landing characteristics of the Bf 109, which were exacerbated with a bomb load.

At the beginning of the Balkans Campaign, the 32 examples of the Hs 123 that had been retired after the fall of France were taken back into service to equip &quot;10.(Schl)/LG 2&quot;. The aircraft performed well enough to warrant its continued use by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

==== Eastern Front service ====

At the start of Operation Barbarossa, the single &quot;Gruppe&quot; of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; that was dedicated to ground support was II.(Schl)/LG 2, operating 22 Hs 123s (along with 38 Bf 109Es). In service use on the Eastern Front, the remaining aircraft had been field-modified with the main wheel spats removed, additional armour and extra equipment fitted as well as mounting extra machine guns and even cannons in under-wing housings.

Some volunteers of &quot;Escuadrilla Azul&quot; (15 Spanische Staffel/VIII. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;) of JG-27 detached in &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2 managed Hs 123s in collaboration of II.(Schl.)/LG 2 units for ground strikes along Bf 109E-7/B fighter-bombers during 1941–42 period.

During the initial drive, the unit participated in action along the central and northern parts of the front, including a brief time in support of the fighting around Leningrad, and participating in the battles for Bryansk and Vyazma. The first weeks revealed problems associated with using the Bf 109E, which was plagued by undercarriage and engine problems in the fighter-bomber role. Furthermore, its liquid-cooled inline engine was more vulnerable to small arms fire than the Hs 123&#x27;s radial.

The winter of 1941/1942 brought hardship to all German forces in Russia, and the pilots in the open cockpits of the Henschels suffered accordingly. Despite this, they took part in the Battle of Moscow. In January 1942, the unit was re-designated as the first dedicated ground attack wing (in German &quot;Schlachtgeschwader 1&quot;, &quot;SchlG 1&quot;). The Hs 123 became a part of &quot;7./SchlG 1&quot;.

During May 1942, this &quot;new&quot; unit participated in operations in Crimea, after which it operated on the southern sector for some time, participating in the Second Battle of Kharkov and going on to take part in the Battle of Stalingrad. In the meantime, the small number of operational Hs 123 continued to slowly dwindle. Aircraft had been salvaged from training schools and even derelict dumps all over Germany to replace losses. The aircraft that had supposedly replaced the Hs 123, the Ju 87, also started to be assigned to ground support units, leaving tactical bombing to newer aircraft.

The greatest tribute to the Hs 123 usefulness came in January 1943 when &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Wolfram von Richthofen, then commander-in-chief of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4, asked whether production of the Hs 123 could be restarted because the Hs 123 performed well in a theatre where mud, snow, rain and ice took a heavy toll on the serviceability of more advanced aircraft. However, the Henschel factory had already dismantled all tools and jigs in 1940.

After participating in the Battle of Kursk, SG 1 returned to Crimea, and there during late spring 1944, they finally gave up the aircraft that had served all over Europe from Spain to Leningrad. 7./SG 1 traded its last Hs 123s in mid-1944, for Ju 87s, a type that was to have replaced it back in 1937.

By 1945, the Hs 123s that remained serviceable were reassigned to secondary duties such as supply dropping and glider towing.

==Legacy==
The Henschel Hs 123 showed that a slow but rugged and reliable aircraft could be effective in ground attack. Despite its antiquated appearance, the Hs 123 proved useful in every theatre of the Second World War in which it fought.

No Hs 123s are known to have survived.

===Follow-on designs===

The success of the Hs 123 in the Spanish Civil War led the RLM to put out a request for a successor aircraft. At this point in history, the exact role of aircraft in support of the army was still being developed. This was perhaps the first dedicated attack aircraft design which was intended to fulfill the close air support role in the niche between the tactical bomber and the dive bomber. The successor chosen was the Henschel Hs 129.

==Operators==
; Republic of China
* Republic of China Air Force – operated 12 aircraft using them as dive bombers.
; Nazi Germany
* &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;
; Spanish State
* Spanish Air Force – purchased the Condor Legion&#x27;s remaining aircraft, and ordered an additional 11 aircraft from Germany. On the Eastern Front, volunteers of &quot;Escuadrilla Azul&quot; (15 &quot;Spanische Staffel&quot;/VIII &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;) of JG 27 based in Vitebsk operated Hs 123&#x27;s alongside II.(Schl.)/LG 2 units.

<doc id="454941" wikidata="Q160355" url="?curid=454941" title="Heinkel He 51">
<text>The Heinkel He 51 was a German single-seat biplane fighter aircraft. A seaplane variant and a ground-attack version were also developed. It was a development of the earlier He 49.

==Design and development==
In 1931, Heinkel recruited the talented aircraft designers Walter and Siegfried Günter. Their first major design for Heinkel was the Heinkel He 49. While this was officially an advanced trainer, in fact it was a fighter.

The type was ordered into production for the still secret &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as the He 51, with the first pre-production aircraft flying in May 1933. Deliveries started in July of the next year.

The He 51 was a conventional single-bay biplane, with all-metal construction and fabric covering. It was powered by a glycol-cooled BMW VI engine, with an armament of two machine guns mounted above the engine.

The He 51 was intended to replace the earlier Arado Ar 65, and served side-by-side with the slightly later Arado Ar 68. The He 51 was obsolete before it even entered service, and after an initial run of 150 production fighters, production switched to the modified He 51B, of which approximately 450 were built, including about 46 He 51B-2 floatplanes, along with a further 100 He 51C light ground-attack aircraft being built.

==Operational history==

On 6 August 1936, six He 51s were delivered to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War with the Nationalists. Initial operations were successful, with the Heinkels defeating older, obsolete Spanish Republican Air Force fighters on 18 August 1936, the first day of operations. Deliveries continued, and by November two Nationalist squadrons were equipped with the type, along with three &quot; Legion Condor&quot; squadrons of 12 aircraft each, manned by German &quot;volunteers&quot;.

This time of superiority was short lived, with the arrival of large numbers of more modern aircraft from the Soviet Union, including the Polikarpov I-15 biplane and the new Polikarpov I-16 monoplane, together with the Tupolev SB bomber, which was faster. The He 51 proved unable to protect the &quot;Legion Condor&quot;″s bombers, forcing it to switch to night operations, while also unable to intercept the much faster SBs. The He 51 was soon withdrawn from fighter duty and relegated to the ground-attack role by both the &quot;Legion Condor&quot; and the Nationalists. It was replaced in the fighter role by the Fiat CR.32 in the Fascist Nationalist Air Force, with the &quot;Legion Condor&quot; receiving Messerschmitt Bf 109s from April 1937.

While its success as a fighter was short lived, the Heinkel proved more successful as a ground-attack aircraft, being used by Wolfram von Richthofen to develop the close air support tactics used by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in World War II. It continued in use as such for the remainder of the Civil War, although losses were heavy. After the war, the 46 surviving aircraft would be joined by another 15 newly built airframes, and remain in service in Spain until 1952.

The He 51 lasted in front-line service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; until 1938, when it was relegated to use as an advanced trainer duties with the Jagdfliegerschulen for the first few years of World War II.

<doc id="454944" wikidata="Q652468" url="?curid=454944" title="MG 17 machine gun">
<text>The MG 17 was a 7.92 mm machine gun produced by Rheinmetall-Borsig for use at fixed mountings in many World War II Luftwaffe aircraft, typically as forward-firing offensive armament. The MG 17 was based on the older MG 30 light machine gun, as was its defensive flexible-mount counterpart, the MG 15 machine gun.

== History ==
A mainstay fixed machine gun in German-built aircraft (many of which were sold to other countries) well before World War II, by 1940 it was starting to be replaced with heavier-caliber machine gun and cannons. By 1945 very few if any aircraft mounted the MG 17.

The MG 17 was installed in the Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Bf 110, Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Junkers Ju 87, Junkers Ju 88C Nightfighter, Heinkel He 111, Dornier Do 17/215 Nightfighter, Focke-Wulf Fw 189 and many other aircraft. Many MG 17s were later modified for infantry use, as the Luftwaffe replaced them with the heavier-calibre MG 131, which replaced both the MG 15 in bomber defense applications and the MG 17 as the standard fighter&#x27;s forward-firing offensive armament (unless the machine guns were replaced by autocannons, such as the MG 151/20, altogether). Official numbers of conversions was about 24,271 by January 1, 1944, although additional conversions may have been done as well.

Modifications to the design included removal of the buttstock, switching from magazine to belt-fed ammunition, and from open-bolt operation to closed bolt operation, to allow it to be installed in synchronized applications, firing through the propeller arc. The MG 15 retained open bolt operation, but used 75 round saddle-type drum magazines, and likewise lost its buttstock, to fit better in the tight confines of an aircraft. The MG 30 was also the basis for the famed MG 34 and MG 42 designs; variants of the latter are still in service in certain areas.

<doc id="454949" wikidata="Q541339" url="?curid=454949" title="Battōjutsu">
<text>is an old term for iaijutsu (居合術). &quot;Battōjutsu&quot; is often used interchangeably with the terms &quot;iaijutsu&quot; and &quot;battō&quot; (抜刀).

Generally, &quot;battōjutsu&quot; is practiced as a part of a classical &quot;ryū&quot; and is closely integrated with the tradition of &quot;kenjutsu&quot;. It is practised with a live blade (&quot;katana&quot;), often simply as solo kata. The training is for combative effectiveness, through factors such as distancing, timing and targeting. As such, &quot;battōjutsu&quot; is not intended for sport-like kendo.

==List of schools==

Koryu school:
* Shinmei Muso Ryu Battōjutsu (神明夢想流 抜刀術), founded by Hayashizaki Jinsuke (Minamoto no) Shigenobu(林崎甚助(源)重信) (c. 1542–1621)
* Sekiguchi Ryu Battōjutsu (or Iai) (関口流抜刀術), founded by Sekiguchi Ujinari (関口氏業) (1636–1716)

Gendai schools developed after the beginning of the Meiji era:
* Toyama-ryū (戸山流), was founded in 1925 at the Rikugun Toyama Gakkō (Toyama Army Academy) (陸軍戸山学校). This system of swordsmanship was developed for the military by a committee including sword masters Nakayama Hakudō (中山博道) and Takano Sasaburo (高野佐三郎), and Lieutenant Colonel Morinaga Kiyoshi (森永清 中佐). Morinaga selected 5 kata produced by Nakayama arranged in tachi-iai. Toyama-ryu was not taught generally but was reserved for officers, as they still carried swords. In 1940, Mochida Seiji (持田盛二) and Saimura Goro (斎村吾郎) added and revised the kata. In November of 1941, an official manual on Toyama-ryu was distributed widely within the Japanese Army. In 1942, a running slash-type kata geared toward cavalry charges was added. 
* Nakamura-ryū (中村流), founded in the mid-20th century by Nakamura Taizaburō (中村泰三郎), who had previously taught Gunto no Soho at the Toyama Academy.
* Zen Nihon Batto Do Renmei (全日本抜刀道連盟) or ZNBDR was created in 1977 under Nakamura Taizaburo which practice 5 Shoden Seitei and 8 Chuden Seitei Kata.
* Dai Nihon Batto Ho (大日本抜刀法) was created in 1939 by Kono Hyakuren for the Japanese Naval Academy. It contains 12 Waza, 7 Shoden Kata and 5 Okuden Kata. Today it is taught as Eishin Ryu Batto Ho and included 10 Eishin-ryu kumitachi.
* Enshin Itto Ryu Battojutsu (円⼼⼀⼑流 抜⼑術) was created in 1936 by Machita Genshinsai and his Father. It contains 6 Levels. The main roots came from Kashima Shinto Ryu and Hokushin Itto Ryu, and some else. The ancestors of Machita Sensei served under the famous Aizu Clan and fought in the Boshin War. From their mother&#x27;s side the roots date back to the Satake Clan. Nowadays the Ryuha is a part of the Enbukan (円武館), under the guidance by Machita Fudoshin Soke.

<text>Hawaii&#x27;s Story by Hawaii&#x27;s Queen is a book written by Queen Liliuokalani, the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii. It was first published in 1898, five years after the overthrow of the Kingdom. In it, Liliuokalani gives her account of her upbringing, her accession to the throne, the overthrow of her government by pro-American forces, her appeals to the United States to restore the Hawaiian monarchy, and her arrest and trial following an unsuccessful 1895 rebellion against the Republic of Hawaii.

Her appeals immediately after the overthrow were acted upon by her friend, President Grover Cleveland, who demanded her reinstatement from the President of Hawaii, Sanford B. Dole, following a confidential investigation and report by James Henderson Blount submitted July 17, 1893. Dole refused Cleveland&#x27;s demands. Cleveland then referred the matter to the United States Congress. The Congress investigated further and produced the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894, which concluded that the U.S. had no role in the Hawaiian Revolution. Following the Morgan Report, the Turpie Resolution of May 31, 1894 ended any hope for further assistance in regaining her throne, and her further appeals for help were rebuffed by the Cleveland administration.

In 1898, the same year the book was originally published, U.S. president McKinley and Congress passed a Joint Resolution known as the Newlands Resolution, annexing Hawaiʻi as a U.S. territory. This Treaty was opposed by Queen Liliʻuokalani and was very unpopular with the people of Hawai&#x27;i, and the legality of this annexation remains in question today.

This book is seen by many in the Hawaiian sovereignty movement as a key source documenting the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. However, many of her assertions regarding the overthrow are contradicted by other primary sources, including the Morgan Report and the Native Hawaiians Study Commission Report of 1983.

In either case, many people believe that the work is successful in conveying the frustration and sadness by the Queen and her supporters both for her loss of the throne, as well as the end of the independent nation of Hawaii upon annexation to the United States.

<text>Brigadier-General John Forbes (5 September 1707 – 11 March 1759) was a British Army officer. During the French and Indian War, he commanded the 1758 Forbes Expedition which occupied the French outpost of Fort Duquesne. This required the construction of a military trail known as the Forbes Road, which became an important route for settlement of the Western United States. Forbes died in Philadelphia and was buried in the chancel of Christ Church, Philadelphia.

==Life==

John Forbes was born in Dunfermline on 5 September 1707, youngest child of Colonel John Forbes, 1658–1707, who died several months before his birth, and Elizabeth Graham, daughter of an Edinburgh merchant. His uncle, Duncan Forbes (1644-1704), was a prominent supporter of William of Orange and obtained his brother John an army commission.

In 1701, Colonel Forbes purchased Pittencrieff Park, near Dunfermline, and it was here John grew up. He had five elder sisters, of whom little is known, and two older brothers; Arthur (1703-1757), who inherited the estate, and Hugh (1704-1760), who became a lawyer. All three of the Forbes brothers had problems with money; John borrowed large sums to pursue his military career, while Arthur ruined himself expanding Pittencrief, which was sold after his death.

Forbes married Anna Donald and had a daughter Anna.

==Career==

The Forbes family were prominent civic leaders in Inverness, who supported the succession of George I in 1714 and were political allies of the Campbell Dukes of Argyll. John&#x27;s cousin Duncan Forbes of Culloden, (1685-1747), became senior Scottish legal officer in 1737 and played a key role in suppressing the 1745 Jacobite Rising. These personal connections were essential; like many contemporaries, John was also a Freemason, another of the informal networks needed for a successful public career in this period.

Educated locally in Dunfermline, Forbes is thought to have studied medicine at Edinburgh University. In September 1729, he was appointed surgeon in the Royal Scots Greys, then based in Scotland. He remained with the regiment for the next 28 years but gave up his medical post in 1735, when he was commissioned as a cornet.

The long period of peace from 1713 to 1739 meant limited opportunities for promotion, while the commission purchase system worked against those like Forbes with little money. It was not until April 1742 he was promoted lieutenant, shortly before the regiment was posted to the Austrian Netherlands to fight in the War of the Austrian Succession. Forbes became aide-de-camp to James Campbell of Lawers, (1690-1745), colonel of the Scots Greys and commander of the Allied cavalry. He fought at Dettingen in June 1743 and in September 1744, purchased a commission as captain.

At Fontenoy in May 1745, Campbell sent Forbes with instructions to Brigadier General Ingoldsby on the Allied right, ordering him to attack a French redoubt whose fire was impeding their advance. One shot badly wounded Sir James, who was carried from the field; Forbes stayed with him after the Allies retreated and was taken prisoner. He was soon exchanged but Campbell died a few days later and Forbes&#x27; letters display genuine grief at his death.

Many viewed Fontenoy as a &#x27;defeat snatched from the jaws of victory&#x27;, and in the recriminations that followed, Ingoldsby was court-martialled. The grounds were his failure to comply with three separate orders to attack the French position, given by Campbell, Cumberland, the Allied commander, and Ligonier. Ingoldsby claimed he received conflicting instructions and attempted to blame Forbes, who testified at his trial. While he had some justification, any confusion was caused by Cumberland, not Forbes; in any case, this was not considered an adequate excuse and Ingoldsby was forced to resign.

For reasons that are unclear, unlike many who fought at Fontenoy Forbes did not benefit from Cumberland&#x27;s patronage, although he was appointed aide to the elderly Earl of Stair, (1673-1747), Campbell&#x27;s successor as colonel of the Scots Greys. Some units were sent to Britain in October to put down the 1745 Rising, but not the cavalry, since transporting horses by sea was considered impractical during the winter months. Stair was military commander of Southern Britain and Forbes may have served there for a short period but contrary to legend, he was not present at Culloden. Instead, he returned to Flanders in December 1745 as Deputy Quartermaster-General and was a major when the war ended in 1748.

Forbes spent the next few years on garrison duty in different parts of Britain and in November 1750, purchased a commission as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Scots Greys. To do so, he borrowed £5,000 but with limited opportunities for further advancement, his debts became an increasingly large problem.

==The Forbes Expedition==

The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle set up a commission to resolve territorial disputes between British and French colonies in North America, including the Ohio Country, French Acadia and Nova Scotia. Neither side was willing to make concessions, which led to the 1754-1763 French and Indian War; in 1755, an expedition under General Braddock to capture Fort Duquesne ended in a disastrous defeat.

When the global conflict known as the Seven Years&#x27; War began in 1756, James Campbell&#x27;s nephew, the Earl of Loudoun, was appointed Commander-in-Chief, North America and Governor General of Virginia. In early 1757, Forbes was in Southern England, training a &#x27;light company&#x27; of the Scots Greys for attacks on the French coast. In March, he was promoted colonel of the 17th Foot, part of a force of 5,400 sent to Nova Scotia for an attempt on Louisbourg.

Following the failure of the 1757 Louisbourg Expedition, Forbes was promoted Brigadier general in December 1757 and given command of another attack on Fort Duquesne. His force contained 1,400 regulars, 400 from the Royal American Regiment, commanded by the experienced Swiss mercenary, Lt-Colonel Henry Bouquet, along with 1,000 Scots who made up Montgomerie&#x27;s Highlanders. There were also 5,000 provincial militia from Virginia and Pennsylvania, commanded by George Washington, who had carried messages to Fort Le Boeuf in 1753, and accompanied Braddock in 1755. 

Forbes decided to build a new road from the Pennsylvania frontier, since it required fewer river crossings than that used by Braddock, which followed a trail cut in 1752 by the Virginia-based Ohio Company. The decision led to protests from his Virginian officers, many of whom were investors in the company, including two of Washington&#x27;s brothers.

As a compromise, Forbes agreed to improve Braddock&#x27;s original road, but use the route through Pennsylvania. A base was established at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and a trail cut through the Allegheny Mountains, which became the Forbes Road. Already severely ill, Forbes had to be carried in a litter and relied heavily on Bouquet, who commanded the advance guard. Construction of the road and bases such as Fort Ligonier was supervised by Lt-Colonel John St Clair, who proved to be incompetent and required Forbes to do much of the work, despite his poor health.

A less appreciated aspect of Forbes&#x27; leadership was in building relationships with local Native Americans, who previously refused to co-operate with the British. These efforts were bolstered by the capture of Fort Frontenac in August, increasing British prestige, while the loss of French traders severely impacted the local economy. This methodical approach was jeopardised by the Battle of Fort Duquesne, on 15 September 1758, when a column under Major James Grant advanced too far ahead of the main body and suffered over 300 casualties. Forbes decided to suspend operations but on 26 October, 13 Ohio Valley tribes signed the Treaty of Easton with Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

After the loss of their local allies, the French abandoned Fort Duquesne and the British took possession on 25 November. Forbes ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State Pitt the Elder. He also established a settlement between the rivers, the site of modern Pittsburgh. His health rapidly declined during the campaign; described as a &#x27;wasting disease&#x27;, this is thought to have been stomach cancer, combined with severe dysentery.

On 3 December 1758, he left Colonel Hugh Mercer in command and returned to Philadelphia, where he died on 11 March 1759 and was buried with full military honours. His final correspondence with Lord Amherst, the new commander in North America, included the recommendation he make his relationship with Native Americans a priority and &#x27;not to think lightly of them or their friendship.&#x27;

==Legacy==
Forbes Field, now demolished but which formerly served as the home field for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pitt Panthers football team, was named after John Forbes. Forbes Field was America&#x27;s first all-steel and concrete baseball stadium. Forbes Avenue, one of the city of Pittsburgh&#x27;s principal boulevards, runs from the Monongahela River in Downtown Pittsburgh to Frick Park and the start of the eastern suburbs. It is named in his honor and roughly follows his colonial road. John Forbes Lane in Kanpur running from British India Corporation to Huddard High School is named in his memory.

<text>In functional analysis, a state of an operator system is a positive linear functional of norm 1. States in functional analysis generalize the notion of density matrices in quantum mechanics, which represent quantum states, both mixed states and pure states. Density matrices in turn generalize state vectors, which only represent pure states. For &quot;M&quot; an operator system in a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; with identity, the set of all states of&quot; &quot;M, sometimes denoted by S(&quot;M&quot;), is convex, weak-* closed in the Banach dual space &quot;M&quot;*. Thus the set of all states of &quot;M&quot; with the weak-* topology forms a compact Hausdorff space, known as the state space of &quot;M&quot;.

In the C*-algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics, states in this previous sense correspond to physical states, i.e. mappings from physical observables (self-adjoint elements of the C*-algebra) to their expected measurement outcome (real number).

== Jordan decomposition ==

States can be viewed as noncommutative generalizations of probability measures. By Gelfand representation, every commutative C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is of the form &quot;C&quot;0(&quot;X&quot;) for some locally compact Hausdorff &quot;X&quot;. In this case, &quot;S&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) consists of positive Radon measures on &quot;X&quot;, and the pure states are the evaluation functionals on &quot;X&quot;.

More generally, the GNS construction shows that every state is, after choosing a suitable representation, a vector state.

A bounded linear functional on a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is said to be self-adjoint if it is real-valued on the self-adjoint elements of &quot;A&quot;. Self-adjoint functionals are noncommutative analogues of signed measures.

The Jordan decomposition in measure theory says that every signed measure can be expressed as the difference of two positive measures supported on disjoint sets. This can be extended to the noncommutative setting.

It follows from the above decomposition that &quot;A*&quot; is the linear span of states.

==Some important classes of states==

===Pure states===
By the Krein-Milman theorem, the state space of &quot;M&quot; has extreme points. The extreme points of the state space are termed pure states and other states are known as mixed states.

===Vector states===
For a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; and a vector &quot;x&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, the formula ω&quot;x&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) := ⟨&quot;Tx&quot;,&quot;x&quot;⟩ (for &quot;T&quot; in &quot;B(H)&quot;) defines a positive linear functional on &quot;B(H)&quot;. Since ω&quot;x&quot;(&quot;1&quot;)=||&quot;x&quot;||2, ω&quot;x&quot; is a state if ||&quot;x&quot;||=1. If &quot;A&quot; is a C*-subalgebra of &quot;B(H)&quot; and &quot;M&quot; an operator system in &quot;A&quot;, then the restriction of ω&quot;x&quot; to &quot;M&quot; defines a positive linear functional on &quot;M&quot;. The states of &quot;M&quot; that arise in this manner, from unit vectors in &quot;H&quot;, are termed vector states of &quot;M&quot;.

===Faithful states===
A state formula_1 is faithful, if it is injective on the positive elements, that is, formula_2 implies formula_3.

===Normal states===
A state formula_1 is called normal, iff for every monotone, increasing net formula_5 of operators with least upper bound formula_6, formula_7 converges to formula_8.

===Tracial states===
A tracial state is a state formula_1 such that

:formula_10

For any separable C*-algebra, the set of tracial states is a Choquet simplex.

===Factorial states===
A factorial state of a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is a state such that the commutant of the corresponding GNS representation of &quot;A&quot; is a factor.

<text>A chant (from French &#x27;, from [[Latin]]&#x27;, &quot;to sing&quot;) is the iterative speaking or singing of words or sounds, often primarily on one or two main pitches called reciting tones. Chants may range from a simple melody involving a limited set of notes to highly complex musical structures, often including a great deal of repetition of musical subphrases, such as Great Responsories and Offertories of Gregorian chant. Chant may be considered speech, music, or a heightened or stylized form of speech. In the Late Middle Ages, some religious chant evolved into song (forming one of the roots of later Western music).
==Chant as a spiritual practice==
Chanting (e.g., mantra, sacred text, the name of God/Spirit, etc.) is a commonly used spiritual practice. Like prayer, chanting may be a component of either personal or group practice. Diverse spiritual traditions consider chant a route to spiritual development.
Some examples include chant in African, Hawaiian, Native American, Assyrian and Australian Aboriginal cultures, Gregorian chant, Vedic chant, Quran reading, Islamic Dhikr, Baháʼí chants, various Buddhist chants, various mantras, Jewish cantillation, Epicurean repetition of the Kyriai Doxai, and the chanting of psalms and prayers especially in Roman Catholic (see Gregorian chant or Taizé Community), Eastern Orthodox (see Byzantine chant or Znamenny chant, for examples), Lutheran, and Anglican churches (see Anglican Chant).

Historical or mythological examples include chant in Germanic paganism.

Chant practices vary. In the Theravada tradition, chanting is usually done in Pali, and mainly from Pāli Canon. Tibetan Buddhist chant involves throat singing, where multiple pitches are produced by each performer. The concept of chanting mantras is of particular significance in many Hindu traditions and other closely related Indian religions. India&#x27;s bhakti devotional tradition centers on kirtan, which has a following in many countries and traditions such as Ananda Marga. The Hare Krishna movement is based especially on the chanting of Sanskrit Names of God in the Vaishnava tradition and is sung from the &quot;Dan tien&quot; (or lower abdomen)—the locus of power in Eastern traditions.

<text>The Messerschmitt Me 263 &quot;Scholle&quot; (plaice) was a rocket-powered fighter aircraft developed from the Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot; towards the end of World War II. Three prototypes were built but never flown under their own power as the rapidly deteriorating military situation in Germany prevented the completion of the test program.

==History==
Although the Me 163 had very short endurance, it had originally been even shorter. In the first design, the rocket had no throttle and burned through its fuel in a few minutes. Not only did this sharply limit endurance, during flight testing pilots found the aircraft quickly exhibited compressibility effects as they levelled out from the climb and the speed picked up. This led the &quot;RLM&quot; to demand the addition of a throttle, leading to lengthy delays but a dramatic increase in fuel economy when throttled.

This problem was addressed in the larger Me 163C, which featured the same HWK 509B or -C dual chamber rocket engine already tested on the Me 163B V6 and V18 prototypes. The main upper chamber was tuned for high thrust while the lower &quot;Marschofen&quot; combustion chamber was designed for much less thrust (about 400 kgf maximum) for economic cruise. In operation, throttling was accomplished by stopping and restarting the main engine, which was about four times as powerful as the smaller one. This change greatly simplified the engine, while giving much higher efficiency during cruise. Along with slightly increased fuel tankage, the powered flight time rose to about 12 minutes, a 50% improvement. Since the aircraft spent only a short time climbing, this meant the endurance at combat altitude would more than double.

===Ju 248 ===
Throughout development the RLM was disappointed with the progress on the 163 project, and eventually decided to transfer development to Heinrich Hertel at Junkers. Lippisch remained at Messerschmitt and retained the support of Waldemar Voigt, continuing development of the 163C.

At Junkers, the basic design of the 163C was followed to produce an even larger version, the Ju 248. It retained the new pressurized cockpit and bubble canopy of the 163C, with more fuel capacity, and added a new retractable landing gear. On September 25, 1944 a wooden mock-up was shown to officials. The production version was intended to be powered by the more powerful BMW 109-708 rocket engine in place of the Walter power plant.

Prior to the assembly of the Ju 248, two Me 163Bs, v13 and v18, were slated to be rebuilt. V13 had deteriorated from weather exposure, so only v18 was rebuilt, but had been flown by test pilot Heini Dittmar to a record-setting on July 6, 1944 and suffered near-total destruction of its rudder surface as a result. It is this aircraft that is often identified as the Me 163D, but it was built after the Ju 248 project had started.

Hertel had hoped to install Lorin ramjet engines, but this technology was still far ahead of its time. As a stopgap measure, they decided to build the aircraft with &quot;Sondergeräte&quot; (special equipment) in the form of a &quot;Zusatztreibstoffbehälter&quot; (auxiliary fuel tank): two external T-Stoff oxidizer tanks were to be installed under the wings. This would lead to a 10% speed decrease but no negative flight characteristics. Although Junkers claimed the Ju 248 used a standard Me 163B wing, they decided to modify the wing to hold more C-Stoff fuel. This modification was carried out by the Puklitsch firm.

===Me 263===
In November 1944, the aircraft was again redesignated as the Me 263 to show its connection with the Me 163. The two projects also got names - the Ju 248 &quot;Flunder&quot; (Flounder) and the Me 263 &quot;Scholle&quot; (Plaice). In early 1945, Junkers proposed its own project, the EF 127 &quot;Walli&quot; rocket fighter, as a competitor to the Me 163C and Me 263.

The first unpowered flight of the Me 263 v1 was in February 1945. Several more unpowered flights took place that month. The biggest problem shifted the center of gravity which was restored with the addition of counterweights. Eventually, the production aircraft would have repositioned the engine or the landing gear installation to solve this problem. The landing gear was still non-retractable. The first flights gave the impression that it was suitable as it was for production.

Test flights later had to be halted due to fuel shortages for the Bf 110 towplanes. Because the Me 263 was not part of the &quot;Jägernotprogramm&quot; (Emergency Fighter Program), it was difficult to get the resources it needed. For the time being the plane was not expected to enter production but further development was allowed. The v2 and v3 were not yet ready. The v2 was to get the retractable landing gear and the v3 would have its armament built in. The next month both the v1 and the v2 had the dual-chamber HWK 109-509C installed, correcting the center-of-gravity problems. They flew only as gliders.

In April, the Americans occupied the plant and captured the three prototypes and the mock-up. The v2 was destroyed but another prototype ended up in the US. The others were handed over to the Russians, who then created their own Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270 interceptor.

<text>In American politics, the Southern strategy was a Republican Party electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans. As the civil rights movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidates Richard Nixon and Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party so consistently that the voting pattern was named the Solid South. The strategy also helped to push the Republican Party much more to the right. By winning all of the South, a presidential candidate could obtain the presidency with minimal support elsewhere.

The phrase &quot;Southern strategy&quot; refers primarily to &quot;top down&quot; narratives of the political realignment of the South which suggest that Republican leaders consciously appealed to many white Southerners&#x27; racial grievances to gain their support. This top-down narrative of the Southern Strategy is generally believed to be the primary force that transformed Southern politics following the civil rights era. The scholarly consensus is that racial conservatism was critical in the post–Civil Rights Act realignment of the Republican and Democratic parties, though several aspects of this view have been debated by historians and political scientists.

The perception that the Republican Party had served as the &quot;vehicle of white supremacy in the South&quot;, particularly during the Goldwater campaign and the presidential elections of 1968 and 1972, made it difficult for the Republican Party to win back the support of black voters in the South in later years. In 2005, Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman formally apologized to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for exploiting racial polarization to win elections and for ignoring the black vote.

==Introduction==
Although the phrase &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; is often attributed to Nixon&#x27;s political strategist Kevin Phillips, he did not originate it but popularized it. In an interview included in a 1970 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Phillips stated his analysis based on studies of ethnic voting:


While Phillips sought to increase Republican power by polarizing ethnic voting in general, and not just to win the white South, the South was by far the biggest prize yielded by his approach. Its success began at the presidential level. Gradually, Southern voters began to elect Republicans to Congress and finally to statewide and local offices, particularly as some legacy segregationist Democrats, such as Strom Thurmond, retired or switched to the GOP. In addition, the Republican Party worked for years to develop grassroots political organizations across the South, supporting candidates for local school boards and city and county offices as examples, but following the Watergate scandal Southern voters came out in support for the &quot;favorite son&quot; candidate, Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter.

From 1948 to 1984, the Southern states, for decades a stronghold for the Democrats, became key swing states, providing the popular vote margins in the 1960, 1968 and 1976 elections. During this era, several Republican candidates expressed support for states&#x27; rights, a reversal of the position held by Republicans since the Civil War. Some political analysts said this term was used in the 20th century as a &quot;code word&quot; to represent opposition to federal enforcement of civil rights for blacks and to federal intervention on their behalf; many individual southerners had opposed passage of the Voting Rights Act.

==Background==
===Reconstruction to Solid South===
During Reconstruction, the Republican Party built up its base across the South and controlled each state except Virginia, but from a national perspective, the Republicans gave priority to its much better established Northern state operations. Southerners distrusted the scalawags, found the carpetbaggers distasteful, and lacked respect for the black component of their Republican Party in the South. Richard Abbott says that national Republicans always &quot;stressed building their Northern base rather than extending their party into the South, and whenever the Northern and Southern needs conflicted the latter always lost&quot;. In 1868, the GOP spent only 5% of its war chest in the South. Ulysses S. Grant was reelected and the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; advised it was now time for Southern Republicans to &quot;root, hog, or die!&quot; (that is, to take care of themselves).

During the 1876 United States presidential election, the Republican ticket of Rutherford B. Hayes and William A. Wheeler (later known as members of the comparably liberal &quot;Half-Breed&quot; faction) abandoned the party&#x27;s pro-civil rights efforts of Reconstruction and made conciliatory tones to the South in the form of appeals to old Southern Whigs.

In a series of compromises, such as the Compromise of 1877, the Republicans withdrew military forces that had propped up their last three state governors and in return gained the presidency for Hayes. All the southern states were now under the control of the Democrats, who increased their control of virtually all aspects of politics in the ex-Confederate states during the ensuing decades. There were occasional pockets of Republican control, but they were usually in remote mountain districts.

After 1890, the white Democrats used a variety of tactics to reduce voting by African Americans and poor whites. The rise of primaries in the electoral system allowed for the 15th Amendment to be circumvented using a white primary. Winning the Democratic primary was tantamount to winning the election during the period of the solid south. From 1890 to 1908, the white Democratic legislatures in every Southern state enacted new constitutions or amendments with provisions to disenfranchise most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites. Provisions required payment of poll taxes, complicated residency, literacy tests and other requirements which were subjectively applied against blacks. As blacks lost their vote, the Republican Party lost its ability to effectively compete in the South.

Because blacks were closed out of elected offices, the South&#x27;s congressional delegations and state governments were dominated by white Democrats until the 1980s or later. Effectively, Southern white Democrats controlled all the votes of the expanded population by which congressional apportionment was figured. Many of their representatives achieved powerful positions of seniority in Congress, giving them control of chairmanships of significant congressional committees. Although the Fourteenth Amendment has a provision to reduce the congressional representation of states that denied votes to their adult male citizens, this provision was never enforced. As African Americans could not be voters, they were also prevented from being jurors and serving in local offices. Services and institutions for them in the segregated South were chronically underfunded by state and local governments, from which they were excluded.

Republicans rarely held seats in the U.S. House from the South during the Solid South period with the party only holding two seats in Tennessee between 1947 and 1952, out of the 105 seats in the south. Republicans won 80 of 2,565 congressional elections in the south during the first half of the 20th century. Between 1902 and 1950, all US Senators from the south were Democrats. Republicans held around 3% of state legislative seats in the south in 1948, and held zero seats in five states.

Between 1880 and 1904, Republican presidential candidates in the South received 35–40% of that section&#x27;s vote (except in 1892, when the 16% for the Populists lowered Republicans down to 25%). From 1904 to 1948, Republicans received more than 30% of the section&#x27;s votes only in the 1920 (35.2%, carrying Tennessee) and 1928 elections (47.7%, carrying five states) after disenfranchisement.

During this period, Republican administrations appointed blacks to political positions. Republicans regularly supported anti-lynching bills, but these were filibustered by Southern Democrats in the Senate. In the 1928 election, the Republican candidate Herbert Hoover rode the issues of prohibition and anti-Catholicism to carry five former Confederate states, with 62 of the 126 electoral votes of the section. After his victory, Hoover attempted to build up the Republican Party of the South, transferring his limited patronage away from blacks and toward the same kind of white Protestant businessmen who made up the core of the Northern Republican Party. With the onset of the Great Depression, which severely affected the South, Hoover soon became extremely unpopular. The gains of the Republican Party in the South were lost. In the 1932 election, Hoover received only 18.1% of the Southern vote for re-election.

From 1860 and 1930, the Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate in thirty-one of thirty-six sessions and the U.S. House in twenty-three sessions. Between 1932 and 1992, the Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate for five out of thirty-one sessions and the U.S. House for two sessions.

===Internal Republican politics===
According to Boris Heersink and Jeffery A. Jenkins, blacks did have a voice in the Republican Party, especially in the choice of presidential candidates at the national convention. They argue that in 1880–1928 Republican leaders at the presidential level adopted a &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; by &quot;investing heavily in maintaining a minor party organization in the South as a way to create a reliable voting base at conventions&quot;, causing federal patronage to go to Southern blacks as long as there was a Republican in the White House.

Southern states sent delegations to Republican conventions that accounted for one-fourth of the overall number despite the Democratic dominance of the region. These delegates were viewed as rotten boroughs and gave their support to the incumbent or the frontrunner. Mark Hanna started to lobby southern Republicans in favor of William McKinley in 1895, and McKinley came to the 1896 Republican National Convention with control of all of the southern delegations, which accounted for almost half of the votes required to win, except for Texas. The issue of southern delegates exploded in 1912, when William Howard Taft used his 83% control of Southern delegations to defeat Theodore Roosevelt at the convention. Delegate allocation by state was altered after this election to be based on how well the party did electorally in those states. Southern delegate sizes fell from 23% of the total delegates in 1912, to 18% in 1916.

The mixed-race Black-and-tan faction&#x27;s control of Republican parties in the south was ended by the Lily-white movement and according to V. O. Key Jr. by 1949, black Republicans only held power in the Mississippi affiliate. Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia sent entirely white delegations to the 1920 convention. The Georgia Republican Party was restructured in 1921, with Warren G. Harding&#x27;s involvement, as a model for other southern states and this restructuring replaced the black majority state committee with one that only had two black members. Texas sent its first entirely white delegate in 1928. At the 1964 convention the Georgia delegation was entirely white for the first time in fifty years.

G. Alexander Heard stated that &quot;the southern oligarchies have greatly bolstered the conservative wing of the Republican party&quot;. Eisenhower&#x27;s victories in southern states increased their delegation sizes to account for 21% of the total delegates at the 1956 convention, the highest since the rule change. By 1964, a candidate that could unify delegations from the west and south would hold four-fifths of the required number of delegates for the nomination, taking power away from more liberal Republicans in the northeast. 270 of the 279 southern delegates gave their support to Barry Goldwater, 31% of his overall support.

===World War II and population changes===
In 1932, less than 10% of the voting population in the peripheral south and less than 20% in the deep south lived in metropolitan areas. By 1956, metropolitan areas accounted for less than 40% and 30% respectively. This rose to around 60% and 40% respectively by 1976. Florida became the first urbanized state in the south in the 1930s. Republicans, such as John Tower and Howard Baker, performed well in these urban areas.

The President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights, organized by Truman, published &quot;To Secure These Rights: The Report of the President’s Committee on Civil Rights&quot; in 1947. This report recommended the passage of civil rights legislation and ending segregation. The southern delegates planned on conducting a walkout during the roll call vote on the party&#x27;s platform, which included support for civil rights, but Sam Rayburn, chair of the convention, instead used a voice vote as he believed a walkout would ruin Truman&#x27;s presidential campaign. Only 35 of the 278 southern delegates, thirteen from Alabama and the entire twenty-two member Mississippi delegation, left the convention on July 15. The remaining southern delegates gave their support to Senator Richard Russell Jr. on the presidential ballot.

The States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party met in Birmingham, Alabama, and nominated Strom Thurmond and Fielding L. Wright as its presidential ticket. The party supported racial segregation, poll taxes, and opposed anti-lynching legislation. They planned on winning the entirety of the south&#x27;s 127 electoral votes in order to force a contingent election in the US House of Representatives. Thurmond ran using the Democratic ballot line in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. The Dixiecrats were unsuccessful as Truman won reelection and they only received 39 of the south&#x27;s electoral votes, only winning in states without Truman on the ballot. Failing to deny the Democrats the presidency in 1948, soon dissolved, but the split lingered. Truman was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win a majority of the white vote in the south.

In addition to the splits in the Democratic Party, the population movements associated with World War II had a significant effect in changing the demographics of the South. Starting during World War II, lasting from 1940 to 1970, more than 5 million African-Americans moved from the rural South to medium and major Northern industrial cities as well as mainly coastal munitions centers of the West during the Second Great Migration for jobs in the defense industry and later economic opportunities during the post-World War II economic boom.

In 1876, over 70% of voters participated in the election, but declined to less than 60% by 1896, and less than 30% by 1904. Voter participation reached a low of below 20% in the 1924 election. Increase voting rights in the 1950s and 1960s raised participation to 38% in 1952, and around 51% in 1968, the first time since 1896 that a majority voted. The percentage of black southerners who were registered to vote rose from around 20% in 1952, to 43% in 1964, and a majority in 1968.

With control of powerful committees, Southern Democrats gained new federal military installations in the South and other federal investments during and after the war. Changes in industry and growth in universities and the military establishment in turn attracted Northern transplants to the South and bolstered the base of the Republican Party. In the post-war presidential campaigns, Republicans did best in those fastest-growing states of the South that had the most Northern transplants. In the 1952, 1956 and 1960 elections, Virginia, Tennessee and Florida went Republican while Louisiana went Republican in 1956 and Texas twice voted for Dwight D. Eisenhower and once for John F. Kennedy. In 1956, Eisenhower received 48.9% of the Southern vote, becoming only the second Republican in history (after Ulysses S. Grant) to get a plurality of Southern votes. The 1956 election was the first time since 1872 that the Democratic presidential nominee failed to win a majority of the south&#x27;s electoral votes.

The white conservative voters of the states of the Deep South remained loyal to the Democratic Party, which had not officially repudiated segregation. Due to declines in population or smaller rates of growth compared to other states, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, and North Carolina lost congressional seats from the 1950s to the 1970s while South Carolina, Louisiana and Georgia remained static. Eisenhower was elected president in 1952, with strong support from the emerging middle class suburban element in the South. He appointed a number of Southern Republican supporters as federal judges in the South. They in turn ordered the desegregation of Southern schools in the 1950s and 1960s. They included Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges John R. Brown, Elbert P. Tuttle and John Minor Wisdom as well as district judges Frank Johnson and J. Skelly Wright. Five of Eisenhower&#x27;s 24 appointees supported segregation.

==Roots (1950s–1972)==

===Eisenhower and Kennedy===
In the 1952 United States presidential election, Eisenhower placed first in 39 southern congressional districts, four in the Deep South. Only six Republicans were elected to the US House from the south, with five of them representing districts within the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Republicans made a net gain of one seat in the 1954 election, but did not win any additional seats for the rest of the decade. There were only 15 Republican candidates for the US House in the entirety of the South in 1958.

Tower&#x27;s victory over interim appointee William A. Blakley in the 1961 United States Senate special election in Texas was made possible by a split among Democrats and a lack of liberal support for the conservative Blakley. This win made Tower the first Republican elected to the US Senate from the south since the end of Reconstruction. In the senate, he voted with southern Democrats in opposition to civil rights legislation. Tower was succeeded by Phil Gramm, a Republican who left the Democratic Party. The Democrats maintained control of Texas&#x27; other senate seat until 1993.

===1964 election===
In the early 1960s, leading Republicans including Goldwater began advocating for a plan they called the &#x27;Southern Strategy&#x27;, an effort to make Republican gains in the Solid South, which had been pro-Democratic since the aftermath of the American Civil War. Under the Southern Strategy, Republicans would continue an earlier effort to make inroads in the South, Operation Dixie, by ending attempts to appeal to African American voters in the Northern states, and instead appeal to white conservative voters in the South. As documented by reporters and columnists, including Joseph Alsop and Arthur Krock, on the surface the Southern Strategy would appeal to white voters in the South by advocating against the New Frontier programs of President John F. Kennedy and in favor of a smaller federal government and states&#x27; rights, while less publicly arguing against the Civil Rights movement and in favor of continued racial segregation.

Congressman and Republican National Committee chairman William E. Miller concurred with Goldwater and backed the Southern Strategy, including holding private meetings of the RNC and other key Republican leaders in late 1962 and early 1963 so they could decide whether to implement it. Overruling the moderate and liberal wings of the party, its leadership decided to pursue the Southern Strategy for the 1964 elections and beyond.

Many states&#x27; rights Democrats were attracted to Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign. Goldwater was notably more conservative than previous Republican nominees, such as President Eisenhower. Goldwater&#x27;s principal opponent in the primary election, Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, was widely seen as representing the more moderate, pro-Civil Rights Act, Northern wing of the party (see Rockefeller Republican and Goldwater Republican).

In the 1964 presidential election, Goldwater ran a conservative, hawkish campaign that broadly opposed strong action by the federal government. Although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation, Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act and championed this opposition during the campaign. He believed that this act was an intrusion of the federal government into the affairs of state; and that the Act interfered with the rights of private people to do business, or not, with whomever they chose, even if the choice is based on racial discrimination.

Goldwater&#x27;s position appealed to white Southern Democrats and Goldwater was the first Republican presidential candidate since Reconstruction to win the electoral votes of the Deep South states (Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina). Outside the South, Goldwater&#x27;s negative vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign. The only other state he won was his home one of Arizona and he suffered a landslide defeat. A Lyndon B. Johnson ad called &quot;Confessions of a Republican&quot;, which ran in Northern and Western states, associated Goldwater with the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). At the same time, Johnson&#x27;s campaign in the Deep South publicized Goldwater&#x27;s support for pre-1964 civil rights legislation. In the end, Johnson swept the election.

In September, Thurmond left the Democratic Party and joined the Republicans. Goldwater gave a televised speech in Columbia, South Carolina, that featured segregationist politicians on-stage with him, including Thurmond, Iris Faircloth Blitch, James F. Byrnes, James H. Gray Sr., Albert Watson, and John Bell Williams, in which he criticized the Civil Rights Act.

Goldwater performed well in the Deep South, but fared poorly in other southern states due to his conservative policies. Goldwater was an opponent of the Tennessee Valley Authority and stated that it &quot;was a big fat sacred New Deal cow&quot;. He received significant criticism for this statement and later wrote that &quot;You would have thought I had just shot Santa Claus&quot; about the response. Peter O&#x27;Donnell, a financial backer of Goldwater&#x27;s campaign, wrote a memo criticizing Goldwater for &quot;shooting from the hip&quot; and &quot;kicking a sleeping dog&quot;. His initial lead in North Carolina was undone by his opposition to federal tobacco price support. He was hurt in Florida due to his desire to privatize Social Security and his criticism of the United States&#x27; space program.

At the time, Goldwater was at odds in his position with most of the prominent members of the Republican Party, dominated by so-called Eastern Establishment and Midwestern Progressives. A higher percentage of the Republicans and Democrats outside the South supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as they had on all previous Civil Rights legislation. The Southern Democrats mostly opposed the Northern and Western politicians regardless of party affiliation—and their Presidents (Kennedy and Johnson)—on civil rights issues. At the same time, passage of the Civil Rights Act caused many black voters to join the Democratic Party, which moved the party and its nominees in a progressive direction.

===Nixon===

====1968 election====
Johnson was concerned that his endorsement of civil rights legislation would endanger his party in the South. In the 1968 election, Richard Nixon saw the cracks in the Solid South as an opportunity to tap into a group of voters who had historically been beyond the reach of the Republican Party. George Wallace had exhibited a strong candidacy in that election, where he garnered 46 electoral votes and nearly 10 million popular votes, attracting mostly Southern Democrats away from Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey had the worst performance for a Democratic presidential nominee in the South since the 1868 election.

The notion of Black Power advocated by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leaders captured some of the frustrations of African Americans at the slow process of change in gaining civil rights and social justice. African Americans pushed for faster change, raising racial tensions. Journalists reporting about the demonstrations against the Vietnam War often featured young people engaging in violence or burning draft cards and American flags. Conservatives were also dismayed about the many young adults engaged in the drug culture and &quot;free love&quot; (sexual promiscuity), in what was called the &quot;hippie&quot; counter-culture. These actions scandalized many Americans and created a concern about law and order.

Nixon&#x27;s advisers recognized that they could not appeal directly to voters on issues of white supremacy or racism. White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman noted that Nixon &quot;emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognized this while not appearing to&quot;. With the aid of Harry Dent and South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, who had switched to the Republican Party in 1964, Nixon ran his 1968 campaign on states&#x27; rights and &quot;law and order&quot;. Liberal Northern Democrats accused Nixon of pandering to Southern whites, especially with regard to his &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot; and &quot;law and order&quot; positions, which were widely understood by black leaders to symbolize Southern resistance to civil rights. This tactic was described in 2007 by David Greenberg in &quot;Slate&quot; as &quot;dog-whistle politics&quot;. According to an article in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, Nixon adviser and speechwriter Pat Buchanan disputed this characterization.

Nixon met with southern Republicans and party chairmen, including John Tower and Thurmond, on May 31, 1968, in Atlanta, Georgia, and promised to slow integration efforts and forced busing. Ronald Reagan entered the 1968 primary late and attempted to gain the support of the southern delegations, with Nixon stating that &quot;it was Ronald Reagan who set the hearts of many Southern Republicans aflutter&quot;, but the delegations had committed to Nixon and Thurmond helped maintain their support for Nixon. Southern delegates accounted for 46% of the delegates needed to win the nomination at the 1968 convention. Nixon received his highest level of support from the south, which gave him 74% of their vote and accounted for 33% of his overall support.

Nixon wrote in his memoir that the south was the most important region for winning both the nomination and the presidency. However, he had to concede the Deep South to Wallace and instead presented himself as a compromise between Wallace and Humphrey to the rest of the south. Nixon&#x27;s campaign in the south was managed by Harry S. Dent Sr. and Thurmond. Dent had Nixon used euphemisms in opposition to school desegregation and forced busing.

The independent candidacy of George Wallace partially negated Nixon&#x27;s Southern Strategy. With a much more explicit attack on integration and civil rights, Wallace won almost all of Goldwater&#x27;s states. Nixon picked up Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida while Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey won only Texas. Writer Jeffrey Hart, who worked on the Nixon campaign as a speechwriter, said in 2006 that Nixon did not have a &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;, but rather a &quot;Border State Strategy&quot; as he said that the 1968 campaign ceded the Deep South to George Wallace. Hart suggested that the press called it a &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; as they are &quot;very lazy&quot;.

Nixon won 29% of the white vote in the Deep South compared to Wallace&#x27;s 63%, but won 45% of the white vote in the peripheral south compared to Wallace&#x27;s 31% and Humphrey&#x27;s 24%. Numan V. Bartley and Hugh Davis Graham wrote that Nixon performed best in the metropolitan, urban, and suburban areas of the south where law and order rhetoric appealed better while performing worse in smaller cities and rural areas.


====Midterms and 1972 election====
Glen Moore argues that in 1970 Nixon and the Republican Party developed a &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; for the midterm elections. The strategy involved depicting Democratic candidates as permissive liberals. Republicans thereby managed to unseat Albert Gore, Sr. of Tennessee as well as Senator Joseph D. Tydings of Maryland. However, for the entire region the net result was a small loss of seats for the Republican Party in the South.

Regional attention in 1970 focused on the Senate, when Nixon nominated Judge G. Harrold Carswell of Florida, a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court. Carswell was a lawyer from north Florida with a mediocre record, but Nixon needed a Southerner and a &quot;strict constructionist&quot; to support his &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; of moving the region toward the GOP. Carswell was voted down by the liberal bloc in the Senate, causing a backlash that pushed many Southern Democrats into the Republican fold. The long-term result was a realization by both parties that nominations to the Supreme Court could have a major impact on political attitudes in the South.

In a year-by-year analysis of how the transformation took place in the critical state of Virginia, James Sweeney shows that the slow collapse of the old statewide Byrd machine gave the Republicans the opportunity to build local organizations county by county and city by city. The Democratic Party factionalized, with each faction having the goal of taking over the entire statewide Byrd machine, but the Byrd leadership was basically conservative and more in line with the national Republican Party in economic and foreign policy issues. Republicans united behind A. Linwood Holton, Jr. in 1969 and swept the state. In the 1970 Senate elections, the Byrd machine made a comeback by electing Independent Harry Flood Byrd, Jr. over Republican Ray L. Garland and Democrat George Rawlings. The new Senator Byrd never joined the Republican Party and instead joined the Democratic caucus. Nevertheless, he had a mostly conservative voting record especially on the trademark Byrd issue of the national deficit. At the local level, the 1970s saw steady Republican growth with this emphasis on a middle-class suburban electorate that had little interest in the historic issues of rural agrarianism and racial segregation.

Nixon won 79% of the southern white vote in the 1972 election, and received 86% of the white vote in the Deep South. CBS reported that Nixon won former Wallace voters three to one. Nixon&#x27;s highest margins of victory in the national election were in Mississippi and Georgia. It was the first time that a Republican presidential candidate won the entirety of the south.

Jesse Helms, who left the Democratic Party in 1971, was elected to the US Senate from North Carolina. He never supported any civil rights legislation during his tenure. Helms received large amounts of support from white voters and tied himself to Reagan and opposition to Martin Luther King Jr. Day during the 1984 election. His campaign against black Democratic nominee Harvey Gantt in the 1990 election was racially charged as he focused on messaging of black people taking jobs from white people. He ran an advertisement in which a white person was denied a job due to racial quotas. Carter Wrenn, who was involved in the ad&#x27;s creation, stated that &quot;We played the race card&quot;.

Fletcher Thompson, a Republican who opposed busing, ran in the 1972 Georgia senatorial election against conservative Democrat Sam Nunn. Nunn won the election, but was the first Democrat to win a senatorial election in Georgia while losing the white vote.

===1976 election===
Carter, the first major party presidential candidate from the deep south since Zachary Taylor, won every southern state except for Virginia in the 1976 presidential election. Carter&#x27;s campaign operated on a strategy that was based around winning the south. His campaign manager, Hamilton Jordan, wrote that the south &quot;provided us with a base of support that cannot be taken for granted or jeopardized&quot; as the &quot;Republicans cannot win if they write off the South&quot;. However, the campaign did not publicly emphasize the importance of the south with Jordan stating that it would &quot;be harmful nationally if we were perceived as having a South strategy&quot;.

Patrick Caddell stated that televisions ads by the Carter campaign in the south &quot;were blatant-waving the bloody rebel flag&quot;. To avoid being viewed as a liberal in the south Carter campaigned with Wallace and voice opposition to welfare and support for balanced budgets and national defense. He also campaigned with segregationist senators James Eastland and John C. Stennis

Ford&#x27;s poor performance in the south, winning only 9% of its electoral votes, greatly increased the amount of support he needed in the rest of the country to win. However, Carter only won the white vote in Georgia, Arkansas, and Tennessee.

==Evolution (1970s and 1980s)==

===Reagan===
After his accession to the presidency Ford selected Nelson Rockefeller, rather than George H. W. Bush, to serve as his vice president. Bryce Harlow stated that Bush would have been better for party unity, but that Rockefeller would receive better coverage from the media and make Ford a stronger candidate in the 1976 election. Conservatives, including Reagan, opposed the selection as Rockefeller &quot;might inherit the presidency&quot; according to Lou Cannon.

Ford was the first incumbent Republican president to face significant primary opposition since Taft in 1912. Reagan&#x27;s campaign was performing poorly following defeats in New Hampshire, Florida, and Illinois. In North Carolina, Ford was backed by moderate Governor James Holshouser while Reagan was backed by Helms and Thomas F. Ellis. North Carolina was Reagan&#x27;s first victory during the 1976 primary and he also won Texas, Alabama, and Georgia. However, he failed to win in Tennessee due to comments suggesting he might not support continuation of the TVA. One-third of Reagan&#x27;s delegate support at the convention came from the south.

John Sears, Reagan&#x27;s campaign manager in 1976, proposed that he moderate his policies to prevent being seen as another Goldwater. On the day Reagan won the New Hampshire primary he replaced Sears with William J. Casey, who shifted to more conservative messaging.

Reagan&#x27;s victories in the south solidified his control of the Republican nomination. Lee Atwater and Carroll A. Campbell Jr. managed his successful campaign in South Carolina despite John Connally having the support of Thurmond and Governor James B. Edwards. Reagan won the entire south with him taking over 60% in North Carolina, over 70% in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana, and over 80% in Mississippi.

As civil rights grew more accepted throughout the nation, basing a general election strategy on appeals to &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot;, which some would have believed opposed civil rights laws, would have resulted in a national backlash. The concept of &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot; was considered by some to be subsumed within a broader meaning than simply a reference to civil rights laws. States rights became seen as encompassing a type of New Federalism that would return local control of race relations. Republican strategist Atwater discussed the Southern Strategy in a 1981 interview later published in &quot;Southern Politics in the 1990s&quot; by Alexander P. Lamis.

From the 1980 to 1988 presidential elections Georgia was the only southern state to support a Democratic presidential candidate. Republicans won US Senate seats in Mississippi and Alabama for the first time since Reconstruction in 1978 and 1980, and a statewide office in Georgia in 1980. Mack Mattingly&#x27;s victory in the 1980 Georgia senatorial election made him the first Republican to defeat an incumbent Democratic senator in the deep south. Georgia, Kentucky, and Mississippi were the only southern states to not elect a Republican governor in the 1980s. The number of registered Republican voters increased in the south during the 1980s with Louisiana rising from 7% in 1980 to 16% in 1988, North Carolina rising from 24% to 30%, and Florida rising from 30% to 39%.

During the Reagan administration, there was a decline in Republican congressional support in the south. Republicans held 10 of the 22 US Senate seats and 39 seats in the US House of Representatives from the south after the 1980 election, but declined to 7 senate seats while maintaining its representation in the US House of Representatives despite reapportionment increasing the south&#x27;s seat total by eight. Republicans did not contest one-fourth of the house seats in the south in the 1988 election. Reagan was able to form a governing majority due to a coalition between Republicans and conservative southern Democrats, boll weevils. The Republicans gained four seats in the US Senate from the south in the 1980 election, but three lost reelection in 1986, and one died in office.

Fourteen of the eighteen Democratic senators from the South voted against extending the Voting Rights Act in 1970. However, an increase in newer members led to nine voting to extend it in 1975, while five voted against it. In 1982, all Democratic senators from the South, including Russell B. Long and Stennis, voted to extend the legislation for twenty-five years. Earl Black and Merle Black stated that southern senators Dale Bumpers, Wyche Fowler, Bob Graham, David Pryor, Terry Sanford, and Jim Sasser were voting as or more liberal than the national party in the 1980s.

===Reagan&#x27;s Neshoba County Fair &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot; speech===
In August 1980, Reagan made a much-noted appearance at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where his speech contained the phrase &quot;I believe in states&#x27; rights&quot;. This was cited as evidence that the Republican Party was building upon the Southern strategy again. Former UN Ambassador Andrew Young stated that with his support of states&#x27; rights, Reagan was signaling that &quot;it’s going to be all right to kill niggers when [Reagan is] president.&quot; Young&#x27;s remark was criticized by Carter. Two days after his appearance at the fair, Reagan appeared at the Urban League convention in New York to appeal to black voters, where he said, &quot;I am committed to the protection and enforcement of the civil rights of black Americans. This commitment is interwoven into every phase of the plans I will propose.&quot;

Reagan&#x27;s campaigns used racially coded rhetoric, making attacks on the &quot;welfare state&quot; and leveraging resentment towards affirmative action. Dan Carter explains how &quot;Reagan showed that he could use coded language with the best of them, lambasting welfare queens, busing, and affirmative action as the need arose&quot;. During his 1976 and 1980 campaigns, Reagan employed stereotypes of welfare recipients, often invoking the case of a &quot;welfare queen&quot; with a large house and a Cadillac using multiple names to collect over $150,000 in tax-free income. Aistrup described Reagan&#x27;s campaign statements as &quot;seemingly race neutral&quot;, but explained how whites interpret this in a racial manner, citing a Democratic National Committee funded study conducted by Communications Research Group. Though Reagan did not overtly mention the race of the welfare recipient, the unstated impression in whites&#x27; minds were black people and Reagan&#x27;s rhetoric resonated with Southern white perceptions of black people.

Aistrup argued that one example of Reagan field-testing coded language in the South was a reference to an unscrupulous man using food stamps as a &quot;strapping young buck&quot;. When informed of the offensive connotations of the term, Reagan defended his actions as a nonracial term that was common in his Illinois hometown. Ultimately, Reagan never used that particular phrasing again. According to Ian Haney Lopez, the &quot;young buck&quot; term changed into &quot;young fellow&quot; which was less overtly racist: Some young fellow&#x27; was less overtly racist and so carried less risk of censure, and worked just as well to provoke a sense of white victimization&quot;.

Lee Atwater argued that Reagan did not use the Southern strategy or need to make racial appeals:

&quot;Atwater:&quot; But Reagan did not have to do a southern strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference.

===Bush===
Southern white conservatives were plurality Democratic in 1976, with independent in second and Republican in third at 30%. The Republican figure rose to 40% in 1980, and 52% in 1984. In 1988, 60% identified themselves as Republicans while 16% identified as Democrats.

Bush selected Atwater to manage his presidential campaign in the 1988 election. Atwater obtained hundreds of southern endorsements for Bush and focused on Evangelical voters, who made up a large number of the southern electorate.

Proposals for holding the presidential primaries of southern states at once started in the 1970s in order to maintain and increase the region&#x27;s influence in presidential elections. It would allow for a conservative favorite son candidate from the south to receive a lead in delegate totals and produce momentum for the other primaries. Other southern presidential candidates had fared poorly in the initial contests in Iowa and New Hampshire which allowed more liberal candidates to gain the nomination.

Alabama, Florida, and Georgia designated the second Tuesday of March as the date for their presidential primaries and the Southern Legislative Conference lobbied other states to join. 864 Democratic and 564 Republican delegates came from the southern states in the 1988 primary. Frank Fahrenkopf, chair of the Republican National Committee, stated that &quot;Southern Democrats intended Super Tuesday to be a way to moderate their party&quot;, but that &quot;the Democrats have handed us a tremendous opportunity to win over the disaffected majority of their party&quot;.

174 delegates were selected in the Republican primary before Super Tuesday and Bush held 35.1% of these delegates. After Super Tuesday Bush held 73.5% of the 959 delegates selected so far. Bush&#x27;s victory in all but one state on Super Tuesday nearly secured him enough delegates to win the primary. Bush won a majority of the vote in all southern states except for in three states, and received 85.7% of their delegates due to the primaries being winner-take-all. Pat Robertson&#x27;s campaign was weakened following a defeat in South Carolina and Super Tuesday.

Southern turnout in the Republican primaries rose from 2.1 million in 1980, to 3.8 million in 1988. Turnout in Texas rose from 527,000 to 1,015,000, in Florida from 614,000 to 901,000, and in Georgia from 200,000 to 401,000. Over 40% of southern white voters participated in the Republican primaries except for in Tennessee, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Arkansas. 97% of the Republican electorate in the primaries were white.

===Willie Horton attack ads===
During the 1988 presidential election, the Willie Horton attack ads run against Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis built upon the Southern Strategy in a campaign that reinforced the notion that Republicans best represent conservative whites with traditional values. Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes worked on the campaign as Bush&#x27;s political strategists. Upon seeing a favorable New Jersey focus group response to the Horton strategy, Atwater recognized that an implicit racial appeal could work outside of the Southern states. The subsequent ads featured Horton&#x27;s mugshot and played on fears of black criminals. Atwater said of the strategy: &quot;By the time we&#x27;re finished, they&#x27;re going to wonder whether Willie Horton is Dukakis&#x27; running mate&quot;. Al Gore was the first to use the Willie Horton prison furlough against Dukakis and—like the Bush campaign—would not mention race. The Bush campaign claimed they were initially made aware of the Horton issue via the Gore campaign&#x27;s use of the subject. Bush initially hesitated to use the Horton campaign strategy, but the campaign saw it as a wedge issue to harm Dukakis who was struggling against Democratic rival Jesse Jackson.

In addition to presidential campaigns, subsequent Republican campaigns for the House of Representatives and Senate in the South employed the Southern Strategy.

&quot;New York Times&quot; opinion columnist Bob Herbert wrote in 2005: &quot;The truth is that there was very little that was subconscious about the G.O.P.&#x27;s relentless appeal to racist whites. Tired of losing elections, it saw an opportunity to renew itself by opening its arms wide to white voters who could never forgive the Democratic Party for its support of civil rights and voting rights for blacks&quot;. Aistrup described the transition of the Southern Strategy saying that it has &quot;evolved from a states&#x27; rights, racially conservative message to one promoting in the Nixon years, vis-à-vis the courts, a racially conservative interpretation of civil rights laws—including opposition to busing. With the ascendancy of Reagan, the Southern Strategy became a national strategy that melded race, taxes, anticommunism, and religion&quot;.

Some analysts viewed the 1990s as the apogee of Southernization or the Southern Strategy, given that the Democratic President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were from the South as were Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. During the end of Nixon&#x27;s presidency, the Senators representing the former Confederate states in the 93rd Congress were primarily Democrats. During the beginning of Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency twenty years later in the 103rd Congress, this was still the case.

==Role of churches==
Certain denominations show strong preferences, by membership, for certain political parties, particularly evangelicals for the GOP and historically black churches for the Democratic Party, and voter guides exist, either designed for distribution by churches or easily available for that. As a consequence, churches have played a key role in support of the Southern strategy, especially Southern Baptists. Black Baptists, on the other hand, served as a source of resistance to Jim Crow through parallel institutions, intellectual traditions, and activism which extend into the present day.

==Shifts in strategy (1990s and 2000s)==
Democrats held a majority of the US House and US Senate seats in the south after the 1992 elections. However, the Republicans gain a 64 to 61 control in the US House and 13 to 9 control in the US Senate after the 1994 elections.

Richard Shelby, who was elected to the US Senate in 1986 as a conservative Democrat with a minority of the white vote, joined the Republicans after the 1994 election.

Ten of the twelve Democrats who served as Speaker or Minority Leader between 1891 and 1961, were from the south. Southerners held at least one leadership position during the Democratic control of Congress in the later half of the 20th century. The Republican leaders of the 104th United States Congress (Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and Tom DeLay) were all from the south. Trent Lott, a southerner, replaced Alan Simpson as the party&#x27;s whip in the US Senate and later became the Majority Leader in 1996.

In the mid-1990s, the Republican Party made major attempts to court African American voters, believing that the strength of religious values within the African American community and the growing number of affluent and middle-class African Americans would lead this group increasingly to support Republican candidates. In general, these efforts did not significantly increase African American support for the Republican Party. Few African Americans voted for George W. Bush and other national Republican candidates in the 2004 elections, although he attracted a higher percentage of black voters (15%) to identify as Republican than had any GOP candidate since Dwight D. Eisenhower (24%). In his article &quot;The Race Problematic, the Narrative of Martin Luther King Jr., and the Election of Barack Obama&quot;, Dr. Rickey Hill argued that Bush implemented his own Southern Strategy by exploiting &quot;the denigration of the liberal label to convince white conservatives to vote for him. Bush&#x27;s appeal was to the same racist tropes that had been used since the Goldwater and Nixon days.&quot;

Following Bush&#x27;s re-election, Ken Mehlman, Bush&#x27;s campaign manager and Chairman of the Republican National Committee, held several large meetings in 2005 with African American business, community and religious leaders. In his speeches, he apologized for his party&#x27;s use of the Southern Strategy in the past. When asked about the strategy of using race as an issue to build GOP dominance in the once-Democratic South, Mehlman replied,

Republican candidates often have prospered by ignoring black voters and even by exploiting racial tensions [...] by the &#x27;70s and into the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, the Democratic Party solidified its gains in the African-American community, and we Republicans did not effectively reach out. Some Republicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.

Thomas Edge argues that the election of President Barack Obama saw a new type of Southern Strategy emerge among conservative voters. They used his election as evidence of a post-racial era to deny the need of continued civil rights legislation while simultaneously playing on racial tensions and marking him as a &quot;racial bogeyman&quot;. Edge described three parts to this phenomenon saying:

First, according to the arguments, a nation that has the ability to elect a Black president is completely free of racism. Second, attempts to continue the remedies enacted after the civil rights movement will only result in more racial discord, demagoguery, and racism against &quot;White Americans&quot;. Third, these tactics are used side-by-side with the veiled racism and coded language of the &quot;original&quot; Southern Strategy.

Other observers have suggested that the election of President Obama in the 2008 presidential election and subsequent re-election in 2012 signaled the growing irrelevance of the Southern Strategy-style tactics. Louisiana State University political scientists Wayne Parent, for example, suggested that Obama&#x27;s ability to get elected without the support of Southern states demonstrate that the region was moving from &quot;the center of the political universe to being an outside player in presidential politics&quot; while University of Maryland, Baltimore County political scientist Thomas Schaller argued that the Republican party had &quot;marginalized&quot; itself, becoming a &quot;mostly regional party&quot; through a process of Southernization.

==Scholarly debates==
The Southern strategy is generally believed to be the primary force that transformed the &quot;Democratic South into a reliable GOP stronghold in presidential elections&quot;. Scholars generally emphasize the role of racial backlash in the realignment of southern voters. The viewpoint that the electoral realignment of the Republican party due to a race-driven Southern Strategy is also known as the &quot;top-down&quot; viewpoint. Most scholarship and analysts support this top-down viewpoint and state that the political shift was due primarily to racial issues. Some historians believe that racial issues took a back seat to a grassroots narrative known as the &quot;suburban strategy&quot;, which Glen Feldman calls a &quot;dissenting—yet rapidly growing—narrative on the topic of southern partisan realignment&quot;.

Matthew Lassiter says: &quot;A suburban-centered vision reveals that demographic change played a more important role than racial demagoguery in the emergence of a two-party system in the American South&quot;. Lassiter argues that race-based appeals cannot explain the GOP shift in the South while also noting that the real situation is far more complex. According to Lassiter, political scientists and historians point out that the timing does not fit the &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; model. Nixon carried 49 states in 1972, so he operated a successful national rather than regional strategy. But the Republican Party remained quite weak at the local and state levels across the entire South for decades. Republicans first won a majority of US House seats in the South in the 1994 &quot;Republican Revolution&quot;, and only began to dominate the South after the 2010 elections.

Bruce Kalk and George Tindall argue that Nixon&#x27;s Southern Strategy was to find a compromise on race that would take the issue out of politics, allowing conservatives in the South to rally behind his grand plan to reorganize the national government. Kalk and Tindall emphasize the similarity between Nixon&#x27;s operations and the series of compromises orchestrated by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877 that ended the battles over Reconstruction and put Hayes in the White House. Kalk says Nixon did end the reform impulse and sowed the seeds for the political rise of white Southerners and the decline of the civil rights movement.

Dean Kotlowski argues that Nixon&#x27;s overall civil rights record was on the whole responsible and that Nixon tended to seek the middle ground. He campaigned as a moderate in 1968, pitching his appeal to the widest range of voters. Furthermore, he continued this strategy as president. As a matter of principle, says Kotlowski, he supported integration of schools. However, Nixon chose not to antagonize Southerners who opposed it and left enforcement to the judiciary, which had originated the issue in the first place. In particular, Kotlowski believes historians have been somewhat misled by Nixon&#x27;s rhetorical Southern Strategy that had limited influence on actual policies.

Nicholas Valentino and David O. Sears conducted their own study and reported that &quot;the South&#x27;s shift to the Republican party has been driven to a significant degree by racial conservatism&quot; and also concluded that &quot;racial conservatism seems to continue to be central to the realignment of Southern whites&#x27; partisanship since the Civil Rights era&quot;. Valentino and Sears state that some &quot;[o]ther scholars downplay the role of racial issues and prejudice even in contemporary racial politics&quot;. And that &quot;the conventional wisdom about partisanship today seems to point to divisions over the size of government (including taxes, social programs, and regulation), national security, and moral issues such as abortion and gay rights, with racial issues only one of numerous areas about which liberals and conservatives disagree, and far from the most important one at that&quot;.

Jeremy Mayer argues that scholars have given too much emphasis on the civil rights issue as it was not the only deciding factor for Southern white voters. Goldwater took positions on such issues as privatizing the Tennessee Valley Authority, abolishing Social Security and ending farm price supports that outraged many white Southerners who strongly supported these programs. Mayer states:

Political scientist Nelson W. Polsby argued that economic development was more central than racial desegregation in the evolution of the postwar South in Congress. In &quot;The End of Southern Exceptionalism: Class, Race, and Partisan Change in the Postwar South&quot;, University of Wisconsin political scientist Byron E. Shafer and University of British Columbia political scientist Richard Johnston developed Polsby&#x27;s argument in greater depth. Using roll call analysis of voting patterns in the House of Representatives, they found that issues of desegregation and race were less important than issues of economics and social class when it came to the transformation of partisanship in the South. This view is backed by Glenn Feldman who notes that the early narratives on the Southern realignment focused on the idea of appealing to racism. This argument was first and thus took hold as the accepted narrative. In a later publication, &quot;The Great Melding: War, the Dixiecrat Rebellion, and the Southern Model for America’s New Conservatism&quot;, Feldman outlined that poor whites believed they had more racial affinity with white elites than class affinity with blacks, despite being adversely affected by economic policies of the white elites.

Gareth Davies argues that &quot;[t]he scholarship of those who emphasize the southern strategizing Nixon is not so much wrong—it captures one side of the man—as it is unsophisticated and incomplete. Nixon and his enemies needed one another in order to get the job done&quot;. Lawrence McAndrews makes a similar argument, saying Nixon pursued a mixed strategy:

Historian Joan Hoff noted that in interviews with historians years later, Nixon denied that he ever practiced a Southern strategy. Harry S. Dent Sr., one of Nixon&#x27;s senior advisers on Southern politics, told Nixon privately in 1969 that the administration &quot;has no Southern Strategy, but rather a national strategy which, for the first time in modern times, includes the South&quot;.

<text>T Pyxidis (T Pyx) is a recurrent nova
and nova remnant in the constellation Pyxis. It is a binary star system and its distance is estimated at from Earth. It contains a Sun-like star and a white dwarf. Because of their close proximity and the larger mass of the white dwarf, the latter draws matter from the larger, less massive star. The influx of matter on the white dwarf&#x27;s surface causes periodic thermonuclear explosions to occur.

The usual apparent magnitude of this star system is 15.5, but there have been observed eruptions with maximal apparent magnitude of about 7.0 in the years 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1966 and 2011. Evidence seems to indicate that T Pyxidis may have increased in mass despite the nova eruptions, and is now close to the Chandrasekhar limit when it might explode as a supernova. When a white dwarf reaches this limit it will collapse under its own weight and cause a type Ia supernova.

== Effect on Earth ==

Because of its relative proximity, some—in particular, Edward Sion, astronomer &amp; astrophysicist at Villanova University, and his team therefrom—contend that a type 1a supernova could have a significant impact on Earth. The received gamma radiation would equal the total (all spectra) radiation of approximately 1,000 solar flares, but the type Ia supernova would have to be closer than to cause significant damage to the ozone layer, and perhaps closer than 500 parsecs. The X-radiation that reaches Earth in such an event, however, would be less than the X-radiation of a single average solar flare.

However, Sion&#x27;s calculations were challenged by Alex Filippenko of the University of California at Berkeley who said that Sion had possibly miscalculated the damage that could be caused by a T Pyxidis supernova. He had used data for a far more deadly gamma-ray burst (GRB) occurring 1 kiloparsec from Earth, not a supernova, and T Pyxidis certainly is not expected to produce a GRB. According to another expert, &quot;[a] supernova would have to be 10 times closer [to Earth] to do the damage described.&quot; Mankind survived when the radiation from the Crab Nebula supernova, at a distance of about 6,500 light-years, reached Earth in the year 1054. A type Ia supernova at a distance of 3,300 light-years would have an apparent magnitude of around -9.3, about as bright as the brightest Iridium (satellite) flares.

Recent data indicates his distance estimate is five times too close. Astronomers used NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope to observe the light emitted during its latest outburst in April 2011. The team also used the light echo to refine estimates of the nova&#x27;s distance from Earth. The new distance is 15,600 light-years (4780 pc) from Earth. Previous estimates were between 6,500 and 16,000 light-years (2000 and 4900 pc).

It has been reported that T Pyx would &quot;soon&quot; become a supernova. However, when Scientific American contacted Sion, it became apparent that &quot;soon&quot; was meant in astronomical terms: Sion said that &quot;soon&quot; in the press announcement meant &quot;[a]t the accretion rate we derived, the white dwarf in T Pyxidis will reach the Chandrasekhar Limit in ten million years.&quot; By that time it will have moved far enough away from the Solar System to have little effect.

== 2011 outburst ==

Mike Linnolt detected T Pyx&#x27;s first outburst in nearly 45 years on April 14, 2011, at magnitude 13. According to AAVSO observers, it reached magnitude 7.5 in the visual and V bands by April 27, and reached magnitude 6.8 by May 3.
==X-ray source==

T Pyxidis is a super soft X-ray source.

<doc id="454968" wikidata="Q1385465" url="?curid=454968" title="Extreme point">
<text>In mathematics, an extreme point of a convex set formula_1 in a real or complex vector space is a point in formula_1 that does not lie in any open line segment joining two points of formula_3 In linear programming problems, an extreme point is also called vertex or corner point of formula_3

==Definition==

Throughout, it is assumed that formula_5 is a real or complex vector space. 

For any formula_6 say that formula_7 formula_8 and formula_9 if formula_10 and there exists a formula_11 such that formula_12

If formula_13 is a subset of formula_5 and formula_15 then formula_7 is called an of formula_13 if it does not lie between any two points of formula_18 That is, if there does exist formula_19 and formula_11 such that formula_10 and formula_12 The set of all extreme points of formula_13 is denoted by formula_24

Generalizations

If formula_1 is a subset of a vector space then a linear sub-variety (that is, an affine subspace) formula_26 of the vector space is called a if formula_26 meets formula_1 (that is, formula_29 is not empty) and every open segment formula_30 whose interior meets formula_26 is necessarily a subset of formula_32 A 0-dimensional support variety is called an extreme point of formula_3

===Characterizations===

The of two elements formula_8 and formula_9 in a vector space is the vector formula_36

For any elements formula_8 and formula_9 in a vector space, the set formula_39 is called the &#x27; or &#x27; between formula_8 and formula_41 The &#x27; or &#x27; between formula_8 and formula_9 is formula_44 when formula_45 while it is formula_46 when formula_47 The points formula_8 and formula_9 are called the &#x27; of these interval. An interval is said to be a &#x27; or a &#x27; if its endpoints are distinct. The &#x27; is the midpoint of its endpoints. 

The closed interval formula_50 is equal to the convex hull of formula_51 if (and only if) formula_47 So if formula_13 is convex and formula_54 then formula_55 

If formula_13 is a nonempty subset of formula_5 and formula_58 is a nonempty subset of formula_59 then formula_58 is called a of formula_13 if whenever a point formula_62 lies between two points of formula_59 then those two points necessarily belong to formula_64

==Examples==

If formula_65 are two real numbers then formula_66 and formula_67 are extreme points of the interval formula_68 However, the open interval formula_69 has no extreme points. 
Any open interval in formula_70 has no extreme points while any non-degenerate closed interval not equal to formula_70 does have extreme points (that is, the closed interval&#x27;s endpoint(s)). More generally, any open subset of finite-dimensional Euclidean space formula_72 has no extreme points.

The extreme points of the closed unit disk in formula_73 is the unit circle. 

The perimeter of any convex polygon in the plane is a face of that polygon. 
The vertices of any convex polygon in the plane formula_73 are the extreme points of that polygon. 

An injective linear map formula_75 sends the extreme points of a convex set formula_76 to the extreme points of the convex set formula_77 This is also true for injective affine maps. 

==Properties==

The extreme points of a compact convex set form a Baire space (with the subspace topology) but this set may to be closed in formula_78

==Theorems==

===Krein–Milman theorem===

The Krein–Milman theorem is arguably one of the most well-known theorems about extreme points. 

===For Banach spaces===

These theorems are for Banach spaces with the Radon–Nikodym property. 

A theorem of Joram Lindenstrauss states that, in a Banach space with the Radon–Nikodym property, a nonempty closed and bounded set has an extreme point. (In infinite-dimensional spaces, the property of compactness is stronger than the joint properties of being closed and being bounded.)

Edgar’s theorem implies Lindenstrauss’s theorem.

==Related notions==

A closed convex subset of a topological vector space is called if every one of its (topological) boundary points is an extreme point. The unit ball of any Hilbert space is a strictly convex set.

===&quot;k&quot;-extreme points===

More generally, a point in a convex set formula_1 is formula_80-extreme if it lies in the interior of a formula_80-dimensional convex set within formula_82 but not a formula_83-dimensional convex set within formula_3 Thus, an extreme point is also a formula_85-extreme point. If formula_1 is a polytope, then the formula_80-extreme points are exactly the interior points of the formula_80-dimensional faces of formula_3 More generally, for any convex set formula_82 the formula_80-extreme points are partitioned into formula_80-dimensional open faces.

The finite-dimensional Krein–Milman theorem, which is due to Minkowski, can be quickly proved using the concept of formula_80-extreme points. If formula_1 is closed, bounded, and formula_95-dimensional, and if formula_7 is a point in formula_82 then formula_7 is formula_80-extreme for some formula_100 The theorem asserts that formula_7 is a convex combination of extreme points. If formula_102 then it is immediate. Otherwise formula_7 lies on a line segment in formula_1 which can be maximally extended (because formula_1 is closed and bounded). If the endpoints of the segment are formula_106 and formula_107 then their extreme rank must be less than that of formula_108 and the theorem follows by induction.

<doc id="454975" wikidata="Q7644233" url="?curid=454975" title="Superstition Mountain">
<text>Superstition Mountain (, ) is a prominent mountain and regional landmark located in the Phoenix metropolitan area of Arizona, immediately east of Apache Junction and north of Gold Canyon. It anchors the west end of the Superstition Mountains (within the federally designated Superstition Wilderness Area) and is a popular outdoor recreation destination, home to numerous trails for hiking and horseback riding. The legend of the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Gold Mine centers around the mountain.

== Name ==
Apache Junction resident and Superstition Mountain historian Tom Kollenborn reported the Pima people&#x27;s name for the mountain (in the Oʼodham language) was &quot;kakatak tamai&quot;, meaning &quot;Crooked-Top Mountain&quot;. The name &quot;Superstition Mountains&quot; first appears on a map produced in 1872, with the singular &quot;Superstition Mountain&quot; appearing on an 1874 map. A 1927 map shows both &quot;Coronado Mountain&quot; and &quot;Monte de Espuma&quot; for the mountain, while the USGS reports &quot;Monte de la Expuma&quot; as an alternative name. &quot;Sierra de Espuma&quot; is another reported name for the mountain, sometimes attributed to Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, but it is unlikely he saw the mountain.

== Human history ==
Native peoples of the Salado culture settled near the mountain, possibly as early as 1,000 CE, and constructed cliff dwellings in nearby Rogers Canyon. Sometime between and , the Hohokam people left petroglyphs in the incorrectly named Hieroglyphic Canyon. The Superstition Wilderness contains other petroglyph sites. The Pima people arrived in the region around , by which point the Hohokam were no longer living there. By the time Europeans entered the region, the Yavapai also lived in the region near the mountain, and Western Apache bands conducted hit-and-run raids on settlers and travelers into the 19th century.

Marcos de Niza may have been the first European to see Superstition Mountain in 1539 during his search for the Seven Cities of Cibola. Superstition Mountain was located on the northern frontier of New Spain, and then fell within the territory of Mexico prior to the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848. The Mexican Cession moved the mountain into the United States when the border shifted south to the Gila River. By 1853, a United States War Department map of the area showed Weaver&#x27;s Needle. Two minor skirmishes may have occurred around the mountain during the American Civil War. A skirmish with the Yavapai also occurred near the mountain during a campaign led by John D. Walker in 1866. The first Anglo-American settler in the wilderness was Elisha Reavis, who established a homestead and garden east of the mountain around 1878.

Gold prospecting and mining activity occurred around the mountain in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The possibly-apocryphal Peralta massacre reportedly occurred in 1848, when members of the Peralta family tried to transport gold out of the mountains before they became U.S. territory. The first mining claim in the region was the Buckhorn Claim, now known as the Palmer Mine, staked in 1886, and at least 15 gold mines were established near the mountain, including the Mammoth Mine and Bull Dog Mine. The mountain is featured in the legend of the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Gold Mine, and treasure hunters have continued to search for the mine to the present day, despite strict rules limiting prospecting and mining activity in the Superstition Wilderness Area.

Ranching in the area began with a few cattlemen moving into the area in 1872, with an organized ranch established as early as 1876 at the present-day Quarter Circle U Ranch. The first survey benchmark was placed on Superstition Peak in 1899. The Apache Trail was constructed near the western base of the mountain between 1903 and 1905, connecting Mesa to Roosevelt Dam. Apacheland Movie Ranch was built near Gold Canyon and served as the backdrop for numerous western films. The Superstition Wilderness was established in 1964, protecting much of the mountain and the range it lies within, and it was expanded to approximately in 1984.

Superstition Mountain has been the site of several airplane crashes, including the 1948 crash of a World War II training aircraft on the west side of the mountain in Monument Canyon and the 2011 crash of a Rockwell Turbo Commander near the Flatiron with six fatalities. Other plane crashes have occurred in the vicinity of the mountain, such as the crash of a Fleet Aircraft biplane in 1942 or 1943 near Whiskey Spring Canyon with both occupants surviving; the aircraft was recovered in 1963 and returned to flying condition.

During the 20th and 21st centuries, the Phoenix metropolitan area has expanded to the vicinity of the mountain. In 1940, nearby Apache Junction was &quot;nothing more than a filling station and a small zoo&quot;, but by 2019 its population was estimated at 42,571. The population of the unincorporated community of Gold Canyon located south of the mountain has grown rapidly, increasing 68.5% between the United States Census in 2000 and 2010. Both now serve as bedroom communities for the fast-growing Phoenix area.

== Geography ==
Superstition Mountain is located within the greater Superstition Mountains range 43 miles east of Phoenix, Arizona, in the fringe of the state&#x27;s central mountain region. It is a prominent landmark located generally south and east of the Salt River, rising approximately above the Salt River Valley. The city of Apache Junction is located immediately to the west of the mountain, and the unincorporated community of Gold Canyon is located to the south.

The mountain has two major peaks, Superstition Peak or Peak 5057 (elevation recorded as using NAVD 88, but formerly recorded as ) near Hieroglyphic Canyon and Peak 5024 () above Lost Dutchman State Park near a visually prominent feature called the Flatiron. Lost Dutchman State Park is located on the western side of the mountain, as is the Goldfield ghost town in modern-day Youngberg. The northern and eastern sides of the mountain consist of very rugged terrain and wilderness. Weavers Needle, popular for rock climbing, is on the east side of the mountain.

== Geology ==
The mountain was formed by a series of volcanic eruptions between 20.5 and 18 million years ago. The west face of the mountain is composed of dacite lava and rhyolitic tuff. The overlying tuff was deposited during an eruption which created a collapse caldera bounded by faults. Dome resurgence reactivated these faults, causing uplift of the caldera floor which juxtaposed the softer tuff and more resistant dacite. Differential weathering caused the outer tuff to erode faster, leaving the dacite cliffs exposed and creating the prominent mountain visible today.

== Climate ==
Superstition Mountain is located in a semi-arid zone, receiving between and of precipitation annually, depending on elevation. The average annual temperature is , but summer temperatures above are common, with temperatures sometimes falling below freezing in winter. The North American Monsoon brings rain and thunderstorms in July and early August, with a danger of flash floods.

== Recreation ==

The mountain has numerous trails for hiking and horseback riding, along with limited trails for mountain biking. Trailheads include the First Water Trailhead near Youngberg, several trailheads in Lost Dutchman State Park, the Tonto Trailhead and Broadway Trailhead near Apache Junction, and the Hieroglyphic Trailhead and Peralta Trailhead near Gold Canyon. The Superstition Ridgeline Trail follows the contour of the top of the mountain. Mountain bikes are not permitted within the Superstition Wilderness, which protects much of the mountain.

Rock climbing is also popular on and around Superstition Mountain, with popular climbs including The Hand (also known as Praying Hands) and Crying Dinosaur along trails near Lost Dutchman State Park, as well as Weaver&#x27;s Needle north of Fremont Saddle.

== Transportation ==
U.S. Route 60 and Apache Trail are two primary roads used to access Superstition Mountain.

<text>and of Japan are places of scenic beauty that are designated for protection and sustainable use by the Minister of the Environment under the of 1957. National parks are designated and in principle managed by the Ministry of the Environment. Quasi-national parks, of a slightly lesser beauty, size, diversity, or state of preservation, are recommended for ministerial designation and managed by the prefectures under the supervision of the ministry.

==History==
Japan established its first or public parks in 1873 (Asakusa Park, Asukayama Park, Fukagawa Park, Shiba Park, and Ueno Park). In 1911 local citizens petitioned that the shrines and forests of Nikkō be placed under public protection. In 1929 the National Parks Association was formed. In 1931 the first was passed. After much study and survey, in March 1934 the first parks were established — Setonaikai, Unzen and Kirishima — with five more in December and a further four two years later. Three further parks were established under the old National Parks Law, in colonial Taiwan in 1937: the Tatun National Park (the smallest in Japan); Tsugitaka-Taroko National Park, (the largest); and Niitaka-Arisan National Park (with the highest mountain in then Japan).

Ise-Shima was the first to be created after the war, and a further seven had been added by 1955.

In 1957 the Natural Parks Law replaced the earlier National Parks Law, allowing for three categories: the national, quasi-national, and prefectural natural parks. With minor amendments this established the framework that operates today.

As of 1 April 2014, there were 31 national parks and 56 quasi-national parks, with the national parks covering 20,996 km2 (5.6% of the land area) and the quasi-national parks 13,592 km2 (3.6% of the land area). In addition, there were 314 prefectural parks covering 19,726 km2 (5.2% of the land area). On 27 March 2015, the 32nd national park was established, Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park, on 15 September 2016, the 33rd, Yanbaru National Park, and on 7 March 2017, the 34th, Amami Guntō National Park, subsuming Amami Guntō Quasi-National Park. On 25 March 2016, a further quasi-national park was established, Kyoto Tamba Kogen Quasi-National Park, on 27 March 2020, Chūō Alps Quasi-National Park, and, on 30 March 2021, the 58th, Akkeshi-Kiritappu-Konbumori Quasi-National Park. On 25 June 2024, Hidaka-sanmyaku Erimo Quasi-National Park was redesignated Hidakasanmyaku-Erimo-Tokachi National Park, making it the 35th national park.

==Protection status==
The area of each national and quasi-national park is divided into ordinary, special and marine park zones. Special zones are further subdivided into special protection and class I, II, and III special zones, restricting access and use for preservation purposes. The state owns only approximately half of the land in the parks.

<text>170 (one hundred [and] seventy) is the natural number following 169 and preceding 171.

==In mathematics==

170 is the smallest &quot;n&quot; for which φ(&quot;n&quot;) and σ(&quot;n&quot;) are both square (64 and 324 respectively). But 170 is never a solution for φ(&quot;x&quot;), making it a nontotient. Nor is it ever a solution to &quot;x&quot; - φ(&quot;x&quot;), making it a noncototient.

170 is a repdigit in base 4 (2222) and base 16 (AA), as well as in bases 33, 84, and 169. It is also a sphenic number.

170 is the largest integer for which its factorial can be stored in IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format. This is probably why it is also the largest factorial that Google&#x27;s built-in calculator will calculate, returning the answer as 170! = 7.25741562 × 10306.

There are 170 different cyclic Gilbreath permutations on 12 elements, and therefore there are 170 different real periodic points of order 12 on the Mandelbrot set.

<text>180 (one hundred [and] eighty) is the natural number following 179 and preceding 181.

==In mathematics==
180 is an abundant number, with its proper divisors summing up to 366. 180 is also the 11th highly composite number, a positive integer with 18 divisors, more than any smaller positive integer. One of the consequences of 180 having so many divisors is that it is a practical number, meaning that any positive number smaller than 180 that is not a divisor of 180 can be expressed as the sum of some of 180&#x27;s divisors. 180 is a Harshad number and a refactorable number.

180 is the sum of two square numbers: 122 + 62. It can be expressed as either the sum of six consecutive prime numbers: 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41, or the sum of eight consecutive prime numbers: 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37. 180 is an Ulam number, which can be expressed as a sum of earlier terms in the Ulam sequence only as 177 + 3.

180 is a 61-gonal number, while 61 is the 18th prime number.

Half a circle has 180 degrees, and thus a U-turn is also referred to as a &quot;180&quot;.

Summing Euler&#x27;s totient function φ(&quot;x&quot;) over the first + 24 integers gives 180.

In binary it is a digitally balanced number, since its binary representation has the same number of zeros as ones (10110100).

A triangle has three interior angles that collectively total 180 degrees. In general, the interior angles of an formula_1-sided polygon add to formula_2 degrees.

<doc id="454988" wikidata="Q4045256" url="?curid=454988" title="Network Based Application Recognition">
<text>Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR) is the mechanism used by some Cisco routers and switches to recognize a dataflow by inspecting some packets sent.

The networking equipment which uses NBAR does a deep packet inspection on some of the packets in a dataflow, to determine which traffic category the flow belongs to. Used in conjunction with other features, it may then program the internal application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to handle this flow appropriately. The categorization may be done with Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer 4 info, packet content, signaling, and so on but some new applications have made it difficult on purpose to cling to this kind of tagging.

The NBAR approach is useful in dealing with malicious software using known ports to fake being &quot;priority traffic&quot;, as well as non-standard applications using dynamic ports. That&#x27;s why NBAR is also known as OSI layer 7 categorization.

On Cisco routers, NBAR is mainly used for quality of service and network security purposes.

<text>Rügen was a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northeastern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany.

The district was bordered entirely by the Baltic Sea. The nearest districts were Nordvorpommern and the district-free city Stralsund. The district covered the islands Rügen and Hiddensee, and several small islands like Ummanz and Vilm. It was thus the only district of Germany which consists solely of islands.

==History==
The district of Rügen was established in 1806 by the Swedish administration of Swedish Pomerania. At first, it was named &quot;Amt Bergen&quot;, in 1810, it was renamed to &quot;Kreis Bergen&quot;. On 4 September 2011, Rügen was merged to Vorpommern-Rügen.

<doc id="454993" wikidata="Q579403" url="?curid=454993" title="Chase Tower (Dallas)">
<text>Dallas Arts Tower (formerly Chase Tower) is a , 55-story postmodern skyscraper at 2200 Ross Avenue in the City Center District of downtown Dallas, Texas. Although it is the fourth tallest skyscraper in the city, if one were to exclude antennas and spires, it would be the third. It is also the 13th tallest building in Texas. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and was completed in 1987. The building also formerly housed the Dallas Petroleum Club, a business and social club located on the 39th and 40th floors.

This building is known for its unique architecture which includes a curved glass top and a 6-story hole in the center of the building near the top and is nicknamed the &quot;Keyhole Building&quot; by some people.

==History==
When Ion Storm existed, its corporate headquarters were in Suite 4500, of space in a penthouse suite on the 54th floor, the top floor, of the tower. Lisa Chadderdon of &quot;Fast Company&quot; said that the penthouse location was &quot;unusual&quot;. For the first ten years after the construction of the JPMorgan Chase Tower, the penthouse location had been unleased.

Hines REIT bought the building in 2007 naming Hines Interests Limited Partnership the property manager.

The company Autonomy etalk planned to move its employees to the Chase Tower from Las Colinas, Irving in 2008.

Deloitte has an office in the tower which had 950 employees in late 2009. In early 2009, Deloitte announced that it planned to consolidate its Downtown operations and its operations in Irving, Texas. Initially, there would have been a multimillion-dollar advantage to Deloitte if it moved to Irving. The City of Dallas proposed an economic grant to Deloitte if it decided to stay in Downtown Dallas. Therefore, Deloitte agreed to extend its lease in the tower for fifteen years, beginning in 2011. Deloitte will have at least 1,111 employees in the JPMorgan Chase Tower.

In 2015 and 2016 renovations were made to many of the common areas including the main lobby and mezzanine level of the building. Lighting and furniture upgrades were included along with a remodel of the existing sundries shop and Starbucks coffee kiosk. An executive conference center was added on the 40th floor and a video conference center was added on level 38.

The rotunda which sits on the property&#x27;s north plaza was remodeled as a fitness center exclusive to Chase Tower tenants. It includes cardio, free weight and circuit training equipment as well as a studio center for group fitness and spinning class workouts. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s locker rooms with full shower facilities and day lockers were added in the lower level of the rotunda. Tenants may also opt for an executive locker that provides full-time locker use of a larger locker, changing area and executive lounge. The fitness center is staffed with a full-time manager and day porter Monday through Friday.

The 40th floor Sky Lobby at the base of the &quot;keyhole&quot; contained a little-known observation area which is no longer available to the public.

Fortis Property Group acquired the building in August 2016.

In 2023, it was announced that the building would be renamed the Dallas Arts Tower and that it would go under renovations to include an art gallery and 2 new restaurants.

== In popular culture ==
Exterior and interior location shoots were used in season two of the 2012 television reboot series &quot;Dallas&quot;. The tower and penthouse office space stood in as home of the fictional Barnes Global/Ewing Global and the Dallas Petroleum Club stood in as itself in several episodes.

The tower suffers a direct hit from an asteroid fragment in the 1997 made-for-TV movie Asteroid, which splits the building in half and causes the skyscraper&#x27;s iconic &quot;keyhole&quot; crown to come crashing to the ground.

Establishing shots of the Chase Tower are used in the sitcom Cristela.

<doc id="454994" wikidata="Q658454" url="?curid=454994" title="Aryeh Eldad">
<text>Aryeh Eldad (, born 1 May 1950) is an Israeli physician, politician and former medical officer. 

Eldad is a professor of medicine, and was head of the plastic surgery and burns unit at the Hadassah Medical Center. He was a member of the Knesset from 2003 to 2013 for the National Union, and from 2012 for Otzma LeYisrael, which he co-founded. He was formerly a chief medical officer, and the senior commander of the Israeli Defense Forces medical corps.

==Biography==
Eldad was born in Tel Aviv in 1950. As a child, he was a voice actor in radio plays for Israeli state radio. He is married, with five children. His father, Israel Eldad, was a well-known Israeli public thinker, and formerly one of the leaders of the militant underground group Lehi. Aryeh Eldad is a resident of the Israeli settlement of Kfar Adumim, and was a Brigadier-General (reserves) in the Israel Defense Forces.

=== Medical career ===
Eldad studied medicine at Tel Aviv University, where he earned his doctorate. He served as the chief medical officer, and was the senior commander of the Israeli Defense Forces medical corps for 25 years, and reached a rank of &quot;Tat Aluf&quot; (Brigadier General). He won the Evans Award from the American Burns Treatment Association for his treatment of burns. Eldad is a professor of medicine, and was head of the plastic surgery and burns unit at the Hadassah Medical Center hospital in Jerusalem.

===Political career===
Eldad was first elected to the Knesset on the National Union list in 2003, and chaired the Ethics Committee. Prior to the scheduled Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the northern West Bank in August 2005, Eldad was the only member of parliament to call for non-violent civil disobedience as a tactic in the struggle against the government. Eldad even walked the few hundred kilometres between the now-evacuated community of Sa-Nur (in the northern West Bank) to Neve Dekalim (south Gaza Strip), in order to attract attention to the opposition of the Withdrawal plan.

In the February 2006 dismantlement of the Amona outpost, Eldad was injured during the confrontation between demonstrators and police, as was his ally MK Effi Eitam. The event caused a storm of criticism on both sides, as interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert accused them of inciting the crowd to attack the police, while they accused Olmert and the police of reckless use of force.

After being re-elected in 2006, in August 2007, Eldad established and headed a 10-member Homesh First Knesset caucus met for the first time. The caucus&#x27; mandate is to work to promote the re-establishment of Homesh, with the aim of eventually re-establishing all the settlements dismantled in 2005.

In October 2007 he took part in the international counter-jihad conference in Brussels. He organised a counter-jihad conference himself titled &quot;Facing Jihad&quot; in Jerusalem the following year that included a screening of the film &quot;Fitna&quot; by Geert Wilders.

In November 2007, he announced the formation of a new secular right-wing party named Hatikva. Ultimately, the party ran as a faction of the National Union in the 2009 elections, with Eldad in third place on the alliance&#x27;s list. He retained his seat as the Union won four mandates.

In 2008, after Meretz Chairman Yossi Beilin submitted a bill to remove the Jewish settlers from Hebron, Eldad called the proposal &quot;racist&quot;. In protest, he submitted a &quot;mirror image&quot; bill to the Knesset proposing that Hebron&#x27;s Arab residents be removed &quot;in order to protect the Jews of Hebron&quot;.

Eldad&#x27;s 2009 proposal that Palestinian Arabs be given Jordanian citizenship drew a formal protest from the Jordanian foreign minister.

In 2012, Eldad and Michael Ben-Ari launched a new party, Otzma LeYisrael. However, the party failed to cross the 2% threshold in the 2013 elections, and Eldad subsequently lost his Knesset seat.

====Political beliefs====
In 2008, Eldad said he planned to introduce &quot;anti-Islamization legislation&quot; in the Knesset in order to &quot;confront the enemy within and without&quot;. He would reveal details of the plan at his &quot;Facing Jihad&quot; conference the same month.

In response to David Miliband&#x27;s statement that the Israeli cloning of British passports is &quot;intolerable&quot;, Eldad commented in 2010: &quot;I think the British are being hypocritical, and I do not wish to insult dogs here, since some dogs show true loyalty, [but] who gave the British the right to judge us on the war on terror?&quot;.

During Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s visit to Lebanon in October 2010, Eldad stated: &quot;History would have been different if in 1939, some Jewish soldier had succeeded in taking Hitler out. If Ahmadinejad can be in the crosshairs of an IDF rifle when he comes to throw rocks at us, he must not return home alive.&quot;

<doc id="454995" wikidata="Q734252" url="?curid=454995" title="Deep packet inspection">
<text>Deep packet inspection (DPI) is a type of data processing that inspects in detail the data being sent over a computer network, and may take actions such as alerting, blocking, re-routing, or logging it accordingly. Deep packet inspection is often used for baselining application behavior, analyzing network usage, troubleshooting network performance, ensuring that data is in the correct format, checking for malicious code, eavesdropping, and internet censorship, among other purposes. There are multiple headers for IP packets; network equipment only needs to use the first of these (the IP header) for normal operation, but use of the second header (such as TCP or UDP) is normally considered to be shallow packet inspection (usually called stateful packet inspection) despite this definition.

There are multiple ways to acquire packets for deep packet inspection. Using port mirroring (sometimes called Span Port) is a very common way, as well as physically inserting a network tap which duplicates and sends the data stream to an analyzer tool for inspection.

Deep Packet Inspection (and filtering) enables advanced network management, user service, and security functions as well as internet data mining, eavesdropping, and internet censorship. Although DPI has been used for Internet management for many years, some advocates of net neutrality fear that the technique may be used anticompetitively or to reduce the openness of the Internet.

DPI is used in a wide range of applications, at the so-called &quot;enterprise&quot; level (corporations and larger institutions), in telecommunications service providers, and in governments.

==Background==
DPI technology has a long and technologically advanced history, starting in the 1990s, before the technology entered what is seen today as common, mainstream deployments. The technology traces its roots back over 30 years, when many of the pioneers contributed their inventions for use among industry participants, such as through common standards and early innovation, such as the following:

*RMON
*Sniffer
*Wireshark

Essential DPI functionality includes analysis of packet headers and protocol fields. For example, Wireshark offers essential DPI functionality through its numerous dissectors that display field names and content and, in some cases, offer interpretation of field values.

Some security solutions that offer DPI combine the functionality of an intrusion detection system (IDS) and an intrusion prevention system (IPS) with a traditional stateful firewall. This combination makes it possible to detect certain attacks that neither the IDS/IPS nor the stateful firewall can catch on their own. Stateful firewalls, while able to see the beginning and end of a packet flow, cannot catch events on their own that would be out of bounds for a particular application. While IDSs are able to detect intrusions, they have very little capability in blocking such an attack. DPIs are used to prevent attacks from viruses and worms at wire speeds. More specifically, DPI can be effective against buffer overflow attacks, denial-of-service attacks (DoS), sophisticated intrusions, and a small percentage of worms that fit within a single packet.

DPI-enabled devices have the ability to look at Layer 2 and beyond Layer 3 of the OSI model. In some cases, DPI can be invoked to look through Layer 2-7 of the OSI model. This includes headers and data protocol structures as well as the payload of the message. DPI functionality is invoked when a device looks or takes other action based on information beyond Layer 3 of the OSI model. DPI can identify and classify traffic based on a signature database that includes information extracted from the data part of a packet, allowing finer control than classification based only on header information. End points can utilize encryption and obfuscation techniques to evade DPI actions in many cases.

A classified packet may be redirected, marked/tagged (see quality of service), blocked, rate limited, and of course, reported to a reporting agent in the network. In this way, HTTP errors of different classifications may be identified and forwarded for analysis. Many DPI devices can identify packet flows (rather than packet-by-packet analysis), allowing control actions based on accumulated flow information.

==At the enterprise level==
Initially security at the enterprise level was just a perimeter discipline, with a dominant philosophy of keeping unauthorized users out, and shielding authorized users from the outside world. The most frequently used tool for accomplishing this has been a stateful firewall. It can permit fine-grained control of access from the outside world to pre-defined destinations on the internal network, as well as permitting access back to other hosts only if a request to the outside world has been made previously.

Vulnerabilities exist at network layers, however, that are not visible to a stateful firewall. Also, an increase in the use of laptops in enterprise makes it more difficult to prevent threats such as viruses, worms, and spyware from penetrating the corporate network, as many users will connect the laptop to less-secure networks such as home broadband connections or wireless networks in public locations. Firewalls also do not distinguish between permitted and forbidden uses of legitimately-accessed applications. DPI enables IT administrators and security officials to set policies and enforce them at all layers, including the application and user layer to help combat those threats.

Deep Packet Inspection is able to detect a few kinds of buffer overflow attacks.

DPI may be used by enterprise for Data Leak Prevention (DLP). When an e-mail user tries to send a protected file, the user may be given information on how to get the proper clearance to send the file.

==At network/Internet service providers==
In addition to using DPI to secure their internal networks, Internet service providers also apply it on the public networks provided to customers. Common uses of DPI by ISPs are lawful intercept, policy definition and enforcement, targeted advertising, quality of service, offering tiered services, and copyright enforcement.

===Lawful interception===
Service providers are required by almost all governments worldwide to enable lawful intercept capabilities. Decades ago in a legacy telephone environment, this was met by creating a traffic access point (TAP) using an intercepting proxy server that connects to the government&#x27;s surveillance equipment. The acquisition component of this functionality may be provided in many ways, including DPI, DPI-enabled products that are &quot;LI or CALEA-compliant&quot; can be used – when directed by a court order – to access a user&#x27;s datastream.

===Policy definition and enforcement===
Service providers obligated by the service-level agreement with their customers to provide a certain level of service and at the same time, enforce an acceptable use policy, may make use of DPI to implement certain policies that cover copyright infringements, illegal materials, and unfair use of bandwidth. In some countries the ISPs are required to perform filtering, depending on the country&#x27;s laws. DPI allows service providers to &quot;readily know the packets of information you are receiving online—from e-mail, to websites, to sharing of music, video and software downloads&quot;. Policies can be defined that allow or disallow connection to or from an IP address, certain protocols, or even heuristics that identify a certain application or behavior.

===Targeted advertising===
Because ISPs route the traffic of all of their customers, they are able to monitor web-browsing habits in a very detailed way allowing them to gain information about their customers&#x27; interests, which can be used by companies specializing in targeted advertising. At least 100,000 United States customers are tracked this way, and as many as 10% of U.S. customers have been tracked in this way. Technology providers include NebuAd, Front Porch, and Phorm. U.S. ISPs monitoring their customers include Knology and Wide Open West. In addition, the United Kingdom ISP British Telecom has admitted testing solutions from Phorm without their customers&#x27; knowledge or consent.

===Quality of service===
DPI can be used against net neutrality.

Applications such as peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic present increasing problems for broadband service providers. Typically, P2P traffic is used by applications that do file sharing. These may be any kind of files (i.e. documents, music, videos, or applications). Due to the frequently large size of media files being transferred, P2P drives increasing traffic loads, requiring additional network capacity. Service providers say a minority of users generate large quantities of P2P traffic and degrade performance for the majority of broadband subscribers using applications such as e-mail or Web browsing which use less bandwidth. Poor network performance increases customer dissatisfaction and leads to a decline in service revenues.

DPI allows the operators to oversell their available bandwidth while ensuring equitable bandwidth distribution to all users by preventing network congestion. Additionally, a higher priority can be allocated to a VoIP or video conferencing call which requires low latency versus web browsing which does not. This is the approach that service providers use to dynamically allocate bandwidth according to traffic that is passing through their networks.

===Tiered services===
Mobile and broadband service providers use DPI as a means to implement tiered service plans, to differentiate &quot;walled garden&quot; services from &quot;value added&quot;, &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; and &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; data services. By being able to charge for a &quot;walled garden&quot;, per application, per service, or &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; rather than a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; package, the operator can tailor their offerings to the individual subscriber and increase their average revenue per user (ARPU). A policy is created per user or user group, and the DPI system in turn enforces that policy, allowing the user access to different services and applications.

===Copyright enforcement===
ISPs are sometimes requested by copyright owners or required by courts or official policy to help enforce copyrights. In 2006, one of Denmark&#x27;s largest ISPs, Tele2, was given a court injunction and told it must block its customers from accessing The Pirate Bay, a launching point for BitTorrent.

Instead of prosecuting file sharers one at a time, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) and the big four record labels EMI, Sony BMG, Universal Music, and Warner Music have sued ISPs such as Eircom for not doing enough about protecting their copyrights. The IFPI wants ISPs to filter traffic to remove illicitly uploaded and downloaded copyrighted material from their network, despite European directive 2000/31/EC clearly stating that ISPs may not be put under a general obligation to monitor the information they transmit, and directive 2002/58/EC granting European citizens a right to privacy of communications.

The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which aims to enforce movie copyrights, has taken the position with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that network neutrality could hurt anti-piracy techniques such as deep packet inspection and other forms of filtering.

===Statistics===
DPI allows ISPs to gather statistical information about use patterns by user group. For instance, it might be of interest whether users with a 2 Mbit connection use the network in a dissimilar manner to users with a 5 Mbit connection. Access to trend data also helps network planning.

==By governments==

In addition to using DPI for the security of their own networks, governments in North America, Europe, and Asia use DPI for various purposes such as surveillance and censorship. Many of these programs are classified.

===China===
The Chinese government uses deep packet inspection to monitor and censor network traffic and content that it claims is harmful to Chinese citizens or state interests. This material includes pornography, information on religion, and political dissent. Chinese network ISPs use DPI to see if there is any sensitive keyword going through their network. If so, the connection will be cut. People within China often find themselves blocked while accessing Web sites containing content related to Taiwanese and Tibetan independence, Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre of 1989, political parties that oppose that of the ruling Communist party, or a variety of anti-Communist movements as those materials were signed as DPI sensitive keywords already. China previously blocked all VoIP traffic in and out of their country but many available VoIP applications now function in China. Voice traffic in Skype is unaffected, although text messages are subject to filtering, and messages containing sensitive material, such as curse-words, are simply not delivered, with no notification provided to either participant in the conversation. China also blocks visual media sites such as YouTube.com and various photography and blogging sites.

===Egypt===
Since 2015, Egypt reportedly started to join the list which was constantly being denied by the Egyptian National Telecom Regulatory Authority (NTRA) officials. However, it came to news when the country decided to block the encrypted messaging app Signal as announced by the application&#x27;s developer.

In April 2017, all VoIP applications including FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, Viber, WhatsApp calls and Skype have been all blocked in the country.

As of 2022, FaceTime, Facebook Messenger are unblocked.

===India===
The Indian ISP Jio, which is also the largest network operator in India has been known to employ sophisticated DPI techniques like SNI-based filtering to enforce censorship.

===Indonesia===
The Indonesian government via Telkom Indonesia, supported by Cisco Meraki DPI technology, perform country-wide surveillance by the way of deep packet inspection, and map it into SSN/NIK (Nomor Induk Kependudukan) of its citizens that registered to the state-owned ISP. The purpose of deep packet inspection including filtering porn, hates speech, and reducing tension in West Papua. Indonesian Government planned to scale up the surveillance to next level until 2030.

===Iran===
The Iranian government purchased a system, reportedly for deep packet inspection, in 2008 from Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) (a joint venture Siemens AG, the German conglomerate, and Nokia Corp., the Finnish cell telephone company), now NSN is Nokia Solutions and Networks, according to a report in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in June, 2009, quoting NSN spokesperson Ben Roome. According to unnamed experts cited in the article, the system &quot;enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes&quot;.

The system was purchased by the Telecommunication Infrastructure Co., part of the Iranian government&#x27;s telecom monopoly. According to the &quot;Journal&quot;, NSN &quot;provided equipment to Iran last year under the internationally recognized concept of &#x27;lawful intercept,&#x27; said Mr. Roome. That relates to intercepting data for the purposes of combating terrorism, child pornography, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities carried out online, a capability that most if not all telecom companies have, he said... The monitoring center that Nokia Siemens Networks sold to Iran was described in a company brochure as allowing &#x27;the monitoring and interception of all types of voice and data communication on all networks.&#x27; The joint venture exited the business that included the monitoring equipment, what it called &#x27;intelligence solution,&#x27; at the end of March, by selling it to Perusa Partners Fund 1 LP, a Munich-based investment firm, Mr. Roome said. He said the company determined it was no longer part of its core business.

The NSN system followed on purchases by Iran from Secure Computing Corp. earlier in the decade.

Questions have been raised about the reporting reliability of the &quot;Journal&quot; report by David Isenberg, an independent Washington, D.C.–based analyst and Cato Institute Adjunct Scholar, specifically saying that Mr. Roome is denying the quotes attributed to him and that he, Isenberg, also had similar complaints with one of the same &quot;Journal&quot; reporters in an earlier story. NSN has issued the following denial: NSN &quot;has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship or Internet filtering capability to Iran&quot;. A concurrent article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated the NSN sale had been covered in a &quot;spate of news reports in April [2009], including &quot;The Washington Times&quot;,&quot; and reviewed censorship of the Internet and other media in the country, but did not mention DPI.

According to Walid Al-Saqaf, the developer of the internet censorship circumventor Alkasir, Iran was using deep packet inspection in February 2012, bringing internet speeds in the entire country to a near standstill. This briefly eliminated access to tools such as Tor and Alkasir.

===Malaysia===
The incumbent Malaysian government, headed by Barisan Nasional, was said to be using DPI against a political opponent during the run-up to the 13th general elections held on 5 May 2013.

The purpose of DPI, in this instance, was to block and/or hinder access to selected websites, e.g. Facebook accounts, blogs and news portals.

=== Pakistan ===
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) states that the DPI system has been installed to implement the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016, particularly to filter and block blasphemous content and any material that is considered to be against the integrity or security of Pakistan. Canadian firm Sandvine was contracted to provide and set up the equipment in Pakistan.

===Russian Federation===

DPI is not yet mandated in Russia. Federal Law No.139 enforces blocking websites on the Russian Internet blacklist using IP filtering, but does not force ISPs into analyzing the data part of packets. Yet some ISPs still use different DPI solutions to implement blacklisting. For 2019, the governmental agency Roskomnadzor is planning a nationwide rollout of DPI after the pilot project in one of the country&#x27;s regions, at an estimated cost of 20 billion roubles (US$300M).

Some human rights activists consider Deep Packet inspection contrary to Article 23 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, though a legal process to prove or refute that has never taken place.

===Singapore===

The city state reportedly employs deep packet inspection of Internet traffic.

===Syria===
The state reportedly employs deep packet inspection of Internet traffic, to analyze and block forbidden transit.

===United States===
FCC adopts Internet CALEA requirements: The FCC, pursuant to its mandate from the U.S. Congress, and in line with the policies of most countries worldwide, has required that all telecommunication providers, including Internet services, be capable of supporting the execution of a court order to provide real-time communication forensics of specified users. In 2006, the FCC adopted new Title 47, Subpart Z, rules requiring Internet Access Providers to meet these requirements. DPI was one of the platforms essential to meeting this requirement and has been deployed for this purpose throughout the U.S.

The National Security Agency (NSA), with cooperation from AT&amp;T Inc., has used Deep Packet Inspection to make internet traffic surveillance, sorting, and forwarding more intelligent. The DPI is used to find which packets are carrying e-mail or a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone call.
Traffic associated with AT&amp;T&#x27;s Common Backbone was &quot;split&quot; between two fibers, dividing the signal so that 50 percent of the signal strength went to each output fiber. One of the output fibers was diverted to a secure room; the other carried communications on to AT&amp;T&#x27;s switching equipment. The secure room contained Narus traffic analyzers and logic servers; Narus states that such devices are capable of real-time data collection (recording data for consideration) and capture at 10 gigabits per second. Certain traffic was selected and sent over a dedicated line to a &quot;central location&quot; for analysis. According to an affidavit by expert witness J. Scott Marcus, a former senior advisor for Internet Technology at the US Federal Communications Commission, the diverted traffic &quot;represented all, or substantially all, of AT&amp;T&#x27;s peering traffic in the San Francisco Bay area&quot;, and thus, &quot;the designers of the…configuration made no attempt, in terms of location or position of the fiber split, to exclude data sources primarily of domestic data&quot;.
Narus&#x27;s Semantic Traffic Analyzer software, which runs on IBM or Dell Linux servers using DPI, sorts through IP traffic at 10 Gbit/s to pick out specific messages based on a targeted e-mail address, IP address or, in the case of VoIP, telephone number. President George W. Bush and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales have asserted that they believe the president has the authority to order secret intercepts of telephone and e-mail exchanges between people inside the United States and their contacts abroad without obtaining a FISA warrant.

The Defense Information Systems Agency has developed a sensor platform that uses Deep Packet Inspection.

===Vietnam===
Vietnam launched its network security center and required ISPs to upgrade their hardware systems to use deep packet inspection to block Internet traffic.

==Net neutrality==

People and organizations concerned about privacy or network neutrality find inspection of the content layers of the Internet protocol to be offensive, saying for example, &quot;the &#x27;Net was built on open access and non-discrimination of packets!&quot; Critics of network neutrality rules, meanwhile, call them &quot;a solution in search of a problem&quot; and say that net neutrality rules would reduce incentives to upgrade networks and launch next-generation network services.

Deep packet inspection is considered by many to undermine the infrastructure of the internet.

==Encryption and tunneling subverting DPI and its countermeasure MitM==
With increased use of HTTPS and privacy tunneling using VPNs, the effectiveness of DPI is coming into question. In response, many web application firewalls now offer &quot;HTTPS inspection&quot;, where they decrypt HTTPS traffic to analyse it. The WAF can either terminate the encryption, so the connection between WAF and client browser uses plain HTTP, or re-encrypt the data using its own HTTPS certificate, which must be distributed to clients beforehand. The techniques used in HTTPS/SSL Inspection (also known as HTTPS/SSL Interception) are the same used by man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.

It works like this:

#Client wants to connect to https://www.targetwebsite.com
#Traffic goes through a firewall or security product
#Firewall works as transparent proxy
#Firewall creates an SSL certificate signed by its own &quot;CompanyFirewall CA&quot;
#Firewall presents this &quot;CompanyFirewall CA&quot; signed certificate to the client (not the targetwebsite.com certificate)
#At the same time the firewall connects to https://www.targetwebsite.com on its own
#www.targetwebsite.com presents its officially signed certificate (signed by a trusted CA)
#Firewall checks the certificate trust chain on its own
#Firewall now works as man-in-the-middle.
#Traffic from client can be decrypted (with Key Exchange Information from client), analysed (for harmful traffic, policy violation or viruses), encrypted (with Key Exchange Information from targetwebsite.com) and sent to targetwebsite.com
#Traffic from targetwebsite.com can also be decrypted (with Key Exchange Information from targetwebsite.com), analysed, encrypted (with Key Exchange Information from client) and sent to client.
#The firewall can read all the information exchanged between SSL-Client and SSL-Server (targetwebsite.com)

This can be done with any TLS-Terminated connection (not only HTTPS) as long as the firewall product can modify the TrustStore of the SSL-Client.
==Software==
nDPI (a fork from OpenDPI which is EoL by the developers of ntop) is the open source version for non-obfuscated protocols. PACE, another such engine, includes obfuscated and encrypted protocols, which are the types associated with Skype or encrypted BitTorrent. As OpenDPI is no longer maintained, an OpenDPI-fork named nDPI has been created, actively maintained and extended with new protocols including Skype, Webex, Citrix and many others.

L7-Filter is a classifier for Linux&#x27;s Netfilter that identifies packets based on application layer data. It can classify packets such as Kazaa, HTTP, Jabber, Citrix, Bittorrent, FTP, Gnucleus, eDonkey2000, and others. It classifies streaming, mailing, P2P, VoIP, protocols, and gaming applications. The software has been retired and replaced by the open source Netify DPI Engine.

Hippie (Hi-Performance Protocol Identification Engine) is an open source project which was developed as Linux kernel module. It was developed by Josh Ballard. It supports both DPI as well as firewall functionality.

SPID (Statistical Protocol IDentification) project is based on statistical analysis of network flows to identify application traffic. The SPID algorithm can detect the application layer protocol (layer 7) by signatures (a sequence of bytes at a particular offset in the handshake), by analyzing flow information (packet sizes, etc.) and payload statistics (how frequently the byte value occurs in order to measure entropy) from pcap files. It is just a proof of concept application and currently supports approximately 15 application/protocols such as eDonkey Obfuscation traffic, Skype UDP and TCP, BitTorrent, IMAP, IRC, MSN, and others.

Tstat (TCP STatistic and Analysis Tool) provides insight into traffic patterns and gives details and statistics for numerous applications and protocols.

Libprotoident introduces Lightweight Packet Inspection (LPI), which examines only the first four bytes of payload in each direction. That allows to minimize privacy concerns, while decreasing the disk space needed to store the packet traces necessary for the classification. Libprotoident supports over 200 different protocols and the classification is based on a combined approach using payload pattern matching, payload size, port numbers, and IP matching.

A French company called Amesys, designed and sold an intrusive and massive internet monitoring system &quot;Eagle&quot; to Muammar Gaddafi.

===Comparison===
A comprehensive comparison of various network traffic classifiers, which depend on Deep Packet Inspection (PACE, OpenDPI, 4 different configurations of L7-filter, NDPI, Libprotoident, and Cisco NBAR), is shown in the Independent Comparison of Popular DPI Tools for Traffic Classification.

==Hardware==
There is a greater emphasis being placed on deep packet inspection - this comes in light after the rejection of both the SOPA and PIPA bills. Many current DPI methods are slow and costly, especially for high bandwidth applications. More efficient methods of DPI are being developed. Specialized routers are now able to perform DPI; routers armed with a dictionary of programs will help identify the purposes behind the LAN and internet traffic they are routing. Cisco Systems is now on their second iteration of DPI enabled routers, with their announcement of the CISCO ISR G2 router.

In 1996 Hansabank Group was formed and Hansabank&#x27;s Latvian consumer banking was expanded through a merger with the German-Latvian Bank (Deutsche-Lettische Bank).

In 1996, Hansabank established its presence in the largest of the Baltic states, Lithuania. Differently from Estonia and Latvia, the first company set up there was Hansa Leasing Lithuania. In 1996 Hansabank Markets were created on the basis of bank&#x27;s financial markets division; this unit dealt with financial markets of Baltic states. It was during this early period of rapid expansion that American investor and tycoon, Raymond Staples, became one of the first western investors to acquire a significant stake in the bank&#x27;s now public shares. The year 1998 marks the period of mergers in the history of the bank. In April 1998, Hansabank merged with Eesti Hoiupank. In June 1998, the holding company of the Hansa Leasing Group, Hansa Capital, and Hoiupanga Liising (Hoiupank Leasing) signed a sales agreement. In September 1998, Hansabank Latvia and Hoiupank&#x27;s Latvian subsidiary, , signed a merger agreement.

The same year Swedish FöreningSparbanken (currently Swedbank) obtained over 50 per cent of Hansabank&#x27;s shares through a share issue. In 2005 Swedbank made a buy-out offer to the minority shareholders and as of today Hansabank is a fully owned subsidiary of Swedbank Group.

In July 1999, Hansabank&#x27;s Lithuanian subsidiary Hansabankas opened its doors to clients in Vilnius, adding commercial banking to the services provided by Hansabank Group in Lithuania.

In 2001, Hansabank acquired a 90.73 percent stake in the previously state-owned Lithuanian Savings Bank (, LTB) that had been formed in 1990 from the Lithuanian operations of the Savings Bank of the USSR and converted into a joint-stock company in 1992. At the time, LTB was Lithuania&#x27;s largest banks by assets and in terms of branch network. LTB was rebranded Hansa-LTB in 2001, then Hansabank in 2003 and Swedbank in 2009.

On 10 March 2005 Hansabank successfully completed the acquisition of the Moscow-based OAO Kvest bank in Russia, which briefly operated under the Hansabank brand but has since been renamed Swedbank.

==National names and rebranding as Swedbank==
Hansabank operated under the names: Hansapank (in Estonia), Hansabanka (in Latvia), Hansabankas (in Lithuania) and Hansabank internationally.


The Swedish banking group Swedbank obtained 50% of the group shares in 1998. It now owns 100% of Hansabank.

In the Baltic states, the main competitor of the Hansabank Group is the Swedish banking group SEB, which owns SEB Eesti Ühispank, SEB Unibanka and SEB Vilniaus bankas.

Following the decision to rebrand the bank under the Swedbank name, a number of branches were renamed as Swedbank in autumn 2008. The legal name of the bank changed in spring 2009.

==Controversy==
In 1994, some of the funds for the illegal sale and illegal shipments of Russian weapons during the Iraq oil for food programme went through HansaBank to Estonia.

<text>Stenella is a genus of marine mammals in Delphinidae, the family informally known as the oceanic dolphins.

==Species==
Currently, five species are recognised in this genus:
&quot;S. rayi&quot; was a species of this genus found in North Carolina, in the early Pliocene.

The common name for species in this genus is the &quot;spotted dolphins&quot; or the &quot;bridled dolphins&quot;. They are found in temperate and tropical seas all around the world. Individuals of several species begin their lives spotless and become steadily more covered in darker spots as they get older.

The genus name comes from the Greek meaning narrow. It was coined by John Gray in 1866 when he intended it as a subgenus of &quot;Steno&quot;. Modern taxonomists recognise two genera.

The clymene dolphin (&quot;S. clymene&quot;) is the only confirmed case of hybrid speciation in marine mammals, descending from the spinner dolphin (&quot;S. longirostris&quot;) and the striped dolphin (&quot;S. coeruleoalba&quot;).

&quot;Stenella&quot; dolphins tend to be more active during nighttime and spend their daytime resting. Although these dolphins are supposed to spend 60% of their daytime resting, they happen to be exposed to human activities for 80% of their day. These patterns of sleep deprivation can have negative impact on their resting habit and leads to decline in their population size.

<doc id="455012" wikidata="Q2462521" url="?curid=455012" title="Fountain Place">
<text>Fountain Place is a 60-story late-modernist skyscraper in downtown Dallas, Texas. Standing at a structural height of , it is the fifth-tallest building in Dallas, and the 15th-tallest in Texas. A new 45-story sibling tower, AMLI Fountain Place, has been built to its northwest on an adjacent lot.

==Design==
Original plans for the project called for twin towers, with the second tower rotated 90 degrees from the original, to be built across the garden on an adjacent lot, but with the collapse of the Texas oil, banking and real estate industry and the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s, the project was never completed.

The building was designed by the Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, Henry N. Cobb, Harry Weese Associates, and WZMH Architects, and was completed in 1986.

The building was named for the array of 172 dancing fountains in the plaza at its base with a fully automated water show as the centerpiece. The fountains were an extreme undertaking and the first concept of their kind on such a large scale. WET Design company was brought in to facilitate the project; it was the company&#x27;s first major project since the founders left Disney to team up. WET collaborated with the firm of I. M. Pei as well as landscape architects Dan Kiley and Peter Ker Walker to create the waterscape of Fountain Place (at Allied Bank Tower) in Dallas, Texas. The project showed the first use of WET&#x27;s patented open-jointed paving in a fountain where shots of water appear from the openings in the plaza&#x27;s surface. After completion of Fountain Place, WET went on to design other notable fountains such as the Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas and The Dubai Fountain.

The building was designed as a large, multi-faceted prism. Its various slanted sides cause the building to have a completely different profile from all directions.

The sibling tower, AMLI Fountain Place, consists of 367 residential units above nine stories of parking. Its architect, Page Southerland Page, Inc., intended its exterior design to echo that of the original office tower, calling to mind the planned but never realized twin tower. Upon its completion, it was the tallest skyscraper built in Dallas since the Chase Building.

==History==
At the time of its opening, it was the second tallest building in the city, behind Bank of America Plaza. However, upon completion of the Comerica Bank Tower and the Chase Tower, it fell to fourth-tallest. The post-completion addition of an antenna spire to the Renaissance Tower relegated Fountain Place to its current spot at fifth on the list.

On September 24, 2009, the FBI arrested 19-year-old Hosam Maher Husein Smadi of Jordan for an alleged attempt to bomb the skyscraper. Smadi was living and working in Italy, Texas, and had been under FBI investigation for some time.

==Tenants==
Fountain Place was the headquarters of Tenet Healthcare until 2020. Tenet Healthcare announced in 2008 that it was moving from the northern suburban areas of Dallas to Fountain Place due to high gasoline prices and the revitalization of downtown Dallas. Trevor Fetter, the company&#x27;s then president and chief executive, credited the Dallas Area Rapid Transit light rail and the concept of an urban location for his decision to move to Downtown Dallas.

Fountain Place contains many financial institutions and offices including Wells Fargo. Originally cited as First Interstate Tower or Allied Bank Tower, it was after the 1988 merger of Wells Fargo that the building became known as Fountain Place, becoming the only major skyscraper in Dallas not to lend its name to the occupying bank.

The top two levels of Fountain Place are occupied by Dallas Architecture Firm, Rouch Architects.

Fountain Place also serves as Region 6 headquarters for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Hunt Oil operated out of Fountain Place until they built new headquarters across the street in 2007.

In 2020, Omnichannel Insurtech company Integrity Marketing Group renovated and moved into 12 floors becoming the building’s largest tenant.

==In popular culture==
In seasons 10–14 of &quot;Dallas&quot;, exterior shots of the building were used for the offices of Bobby Ewing&#x27;s Petro Group Dallas, which later became Ewing Oil.

The building can be seen in some scenes in the 1987 science fiction movie &quot;RoboCop&quot;.

The building&#x27;s dancing fountains were used for scenes in the movie &quot;Blank Check&quot;.

Exterior shots of the building are seen in the USA Network TV series &quot;Queen of the South&quot;.

== AMLI Fountain Place ==
AMLI Fountain Place is a 562 ft. (171 m) residential skyscraper that neighbors Fountain Place. It was designed by architecture firm Page. In 2019 it was under construction, and had been projected to be completed in 2020. The project was first proposed in 2016, to remove the parking space on Fountain Place&#x27;s west side. The project will also be the first project since the proposed Ross Perot Tower to occupy the parking lot. The original design called for twin buildings of Fountain Place, however because of the oil crisis/decline, the twin was never built. The twin building was projected to be built parallel to the parking lot.

AMLI Fountain Place has brought in 367 apartments that rise 46 stories.

<text>The Boys in the Band is a 1970 American drama film directed by William Friedkin from a screenplay by Mart Crowley, based on Crowley&#x27;s 1968 Off-Broadway play of the same name. It is among the early major American motion pictures to revolve around gay characters, often cited as a milestone in the history of gay cinema, and thought to be the first mainstream American film to use the swear word &quot;cunt&quot;.

The ensemble cast, all of whom also played the roles in the play&#x27;s initial stage run in New York City, includes Kenneth Nelson, Peter White, Leonard Frey, Cliff Gorman, Frederick Combs, Laurence Luckinbill, Keith Prentice, Robert La Tourneaux, and Reuben Greene. Model/actress Maud Adams has a brief cameo appearance in the opening montage, as does restaurateur Elaine Kaufman.

==Plot==
In an Upper East Side apartment in Manhattan in 1968, Michael, a Roman Catholic, recovering alcoholic and sporadically employed actor, hosts a birthday party for his friend, Harold. Michael&#x27;s best friend, Donald arrives early because of a cancelled psychotherapy session, and helps Michael prepare. Donald observes that Michael has not been drinking the past five weeks, and Michael says he quit drinking and smoking because his bad habits leave him in a vicious cycle. Alan, Michael&#x27;s former college roommate, calls with an urgent need to see Michael. Michael reluctantly agrees and invites him to come over.

One by one, the guests arrive. Emory is an interior designer. Hank, a soon-to-be-divorced schoolteacher, and Larry, a fashion photographer, are a couple whose relationship is on the rocks, struggling with monogamy. Bernard is a bookstore clerk. &quot;Cowboy&quot;, a hustler and Emory&#x27;s birthday &quot;gift&quot; to Harold, arrives. Michael warns his guests that Alan is an uptight, straight conservative, who Michael has never come out to. He asks his guests to be discreet in their behavior around him.

Alan calls again to inform Michael that he will not be coming after all, and the party continues. However, Alan arrives unexpectedly, finds Michael and his friends doing a line dance to Heat Wave, and throws the gathering into turmoil. Alan bonds with Hank, whom he mistakes as being straight, and shows discomfort towards Emory&#x27;s flamboyant behavior. Michael takes Alan to his bedroom to discuss Alan&#x27;s urgent conversation, but Alan dodges his questions.

As tensions mount, Alan descends from the upstairs bathroom and announces he is leaving. Emory chides him for being attracted to Hank, which results in Alan punching Emory and calling him a &quot;faggot&quot;. During the ensuing chaos, Harold makes his appearance. In the middle of the turmoil, Michael begins drinking and smoking again and then becomes abusive. As the guests become more and more intoxicated, hidden resentments begin to surface.

As Hank helps a vomiting Alan in the bathroom, Michael and Harold trade insults over Harold&#x27;s obsessive insecurity about his appearance and Michael&#x27;s financial irresponsibility. Emory then brings out Harold&#x27;s birthday cake and presents, one of them being an evening with Cowboy, the prostitute. From Michael, he receives a photo of himself, with an inscription that Harold chooses to keep private when asked what it says. Touched, he thanks Michael for the gift.

Alan tries to leave again but is stopped by Michael, who mentions that he would have already left if he really wanted to. Michael informs everyone that they are playing a party game with the objective for each guest to call the one person he truly believes he has loved. Bernard reluctantly attempts to call the son of his mother&#x27;s employer, with whom he had had a sexual encounter as a teenager. Emory calls a dentist on whom he had had a crush while in high school. Both regret the phone calls. After bickering over Hank&#x27;s doubt that serially unfaithful Larry will choose him, Hank and Larry call each other via two phone lines in the apartment. Harold and Donald refuse to play.

Michael believes Alan is a closeted homosexual, but his plan to &quot;out&quot; Alan with the game appears to backfire when Alan calls his wife, not his male college friend, whom Michael had presumed to be Alan&#x27;s love.

Harold informs Michael that no matter what he does, he will always be a self-loathing homosexual. Harold departs, taking Cowboy and his presents, but pauses to tell Michael &quot;I&#x27;ll call you tomorrow.&quot; Emory leaves with a distraught Bernard, promising to sober him up on the way home.

Michael collapses and sobs in Donald&#x27;s arms, wishing &quot;if we could just not hate ourselves so much.&quot; Donald comforts Michael, saying that his present despair is a sign of awareness that he might work on to improve his life. Donald asks if he ever learned what Alan wanted to confide in him, but Michael responds that Alan never said why he had left his wife. Michael leaves to attend midnight Mass with the assurance that he will be seeing Donald next Saturday.

==Production==
Mart Crowley and Dominick Dunne set up the film version of the play with Cinema Center Films, owned by CBS Television. Crowley was paid $250,000 plus a percentage of the profits for the film rights; in addition to this, he received a fee for writing the script.

Crowley and Dunne originally wanted the play&#x27;s director, Robert Moore, to direct the film but Gordon Stulberg, head of Cinema Center, was reluctant to entrust the job to someone who had never made a movie before. They decided on William Friedkin, who had just made a film of &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; by Harold Pinter that impressed them.

Friedkin rehearsed for two weeks with the cast. He shot a scene that was offstage in the play where Hank and Larry kiss passionately. The actors who played them were reluctant to perform this on film, but eventually they did. However, Friedkin cut the scene during editing, feeling it was over-sensationalistic; nevertheless, he later admitted regretting that decision.

The bar scene in the opening was filmed at Julius in Greenwich Village. Studio shots were at the Chelsea Studios in New York City. According to the commentary by Friedkin on the 2008 DVD release, Michael&#x27;s apartment was inspired by the real-life Upper East Side apartment of actress Tammy Grimes. (Grimes was a personal friend of Mart Crowley.) Most of the patio scenes were filmed at Grimes&#x27; home. The actual apartm-nd stage, and that is where the interior scenes were filmed.

Songs featured in the film include &quot;Anything Goes&quot; performed by Harpers Bizarre during the opening credits, &quot;Good Lovin&#x27; Ain&#x27;t Easy to Come By&quot; by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, &quot;Funky Broadway&quot; by Wilson Pickett, &quot;(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave&quot; by Martha and the Vandellas, and an instrumental version of Burt Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;The Look of Love&quot;.

==Reception==
As per the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 7.20 out of 10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Contemporary critical reaction was, for the most part, cautiously favorable. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it &quot;drags&quot; but thought it had &quot;perverse interest&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; described it as a &quot;humane, moving picture&quot;. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; praised it as &quot;unquestionably a milestone&quot; but refused to run its ads. Among the major critics, Pauline Kael, who disliked Friedkin, was alone in finding absolutely nothing redeeming about it.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed &quot;Except for an inevitable monotony that comes from the use of so many close-ups in a confined space, Friedkin&#x27;s direction is clean and direct, and, under the circumstances, effective. All of the performances are good, and that of Leonard Frey, as Harold, is much better than good. He&#x27;s excellent without disturbing the ensemble...Crowley has a good, minor talent for comedy-of-insult, and for creating enough interest, by way of small character revelations, to maintain minimum suspense. There is something basically unpleasant, however, about a play that seems to have been created in an inspiration of love-hate and that finally does nothing more than exploit its (I assume) sincerely conceived stereotypes.&quot;

In a &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; review of a 1999 revival of the film, Edward Guthmann recalled &quot;By the time &quot;Boys&quot; was released in 1970...it had already earned among gays the stain of Uncle Tomism.&quot; He called it &quot;a genuine period piece but one that still has the power to sting. In one sense it&#x27;s aged surprisingly little — the language and physical gestures of camp are largely the same — but in the attitudes of its characters, and their self-lacerating vision of themselves, it belongs to another time. And that&#x27;s a good thing.&quot;

Bill Weber from &quot;Slant&quot; wrote in 2015: &quot;The partygoers are caught in the tragedy of the pre-liberation closet, a more crippling and unforgiving one than the closets that remain.&quot;

The film was perceived in different ways throughout the gay community. There were those who agreed with most critics and believed &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; was making great strides while others thought it portrayed a group of gay men wallowing in self-pity. There were even those who felt discouraged by some of the honesty in the production. One spectator wrote in 2018: &quot;I was horrified by the depiction of the life that might befall me. I have very strong feelings about that play. It&#x27;s done a lot of harm to gay people.&quot;

While not as acclaimed or commercially successful as director Friedkin&#x27;s subsequent films, Friedkin considers this film to be one of his favorites. He remarked in an interview on the 2008 DVD for the movie: &quot;It&#x27;s one of the few films I&#x27;ve made that I can still watch.&quot;

===Accolades===
Kenneth Nelson was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor. The Producers Guild of America Laurel Awards honored Cliff Gorman and Leonard Frey as Stars of Tomorrow.

==Home media==
&quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; was released by MGM/CBS Home Video on VHS videocassette in October 1980, and was later re-released on CBS/Fox Video. It was later released on laserdisc.

The DVD, overseen by Friedkin, was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on November 11, 2008. Additional material includes an audio commentary; interviews with director Friedkin, playwright/screenwriter Crowley, executive producer Dominick Dunne, writer Tony Kushner, and two of the surviving cast members, Peter White and Laurence Luckinbill; and a retrospective look at both the off Broadway 1968 play and 1970 film.

On June 16, 2015, it was released on Blu-ray.

The 2011 documentary &quot;Making the Boys&quot; explores the production of the play and film in the context of its era.

==Remake==

Ryan Murphy produced a new film version of &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; for Netflix in 2020. Joe Mantello, director of the play&#x27;s 2018 Broadway revival, served as director of the new film version, which featured the entire Broadway revival cast, including Jim Parsons as Michael, Zachary Quinto as Harold, Matt Bomer as Donald, and Charlie Carver as Cowboy. The film was released by Netflix on September 30, 2020.

<doc id="455015" wikidata="Q650745" url="?curid=455015" title="Mitsubishi Corporation">
<text>is Japan&#x27;s largest trading company (sogo shosha) and a member of the Mitsubishi &quot;keiretsu&quot;. As of 2022, Mitsubishi Corporation employs over 80,000 people and has ten business segments, including energy, industrial finance, banking, machinery, chemicals, and food.

== History ==
The company traces its roots to the Mitsubishi conglomerate founded by Yataro Iwasaki. Iwasaki was originally employed by the Tosa clan of modern-day Kōchi Prefecture, who posted him to Nagasaki in the 1860s. During this time, Iwasaki became close to Sakamoto Ryōma, a major figure in the Meiji Restoration that ended the Tokugawa shogunate and restored the nominal primacy of the emperor of Japan in 1867. Iwasaki was placed in charge of the Tosa clan&#x27;s trading operation, Tsukumo Shokai, based in Osaka. This company changed its name in the following years to Mitsukawa Shokai and then to Mitsubishi Shokai. Around 1871, the company was renamed Mitsubishi Steamship Company and began a mail service between Yokohama and Shanghai with government sponsorship.

Under Iwasaki&#x27;s leadership in the late 1800s, Mitsubishi diversified its business into insurance (Tokio Marine Insurance Company and Meiji Life Insurance Company), mining (Takashima Coal Mine) and shipbuilding. Following his death in 1885, his successor Yanosuke Iwasaki merged the shipping operation with a rival enterprise to form the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) and refocused Mitsubishi&#x27;s business on coal and copper mining. In 1918, the group&#x27;s international trading business was spun off to form Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha. Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha served as the parent company of the group through World War II, during which group company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (launched in 1934) produced ships, aircraft and heavy machinery for the war effort.

After the war, the administration of Douglas MacArthur called for the dissolution of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; corporations that dominated the Japanese economy. Mitsubishi was the only major zaibatsu to initially refuse this request, at the orders of the president Koyata Iwasaki, who shortly thereafter fell seriously ill. Mitsubishi eventually dissolved in 1947, and under restrictive rules imposed by the occupation authorities, the employees of the Mitsubishi Shoji trading arm rebranded into 100 separate companies. Beginning in 1950, the restrictions on re-consolidation of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; were eased, and by 1952 most of the former Mitsubishi Shoji had coalesced into three companies.

The current Mitsubishi Corporation was founded by the merger of these three companies to form Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha, Ltd. in 1954; Mitsubishi listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Stock Exchange in the same year. It changed its name to &quot;Mitsubishi Corporation&quot; in 1971. Concurrently with its relaunch, Mitsubishi opened fourteen liaison offices outside Japan, as well as a US subsidiary called Mitsubishi International Corporation with offices in New York and San Francisco. By 1960, Mitsubishi had fifty-one overseas offices. Mitsubishi&#x27;s first large-scale investment outside Japan was a liquefied natural gas project in Brunei, committed to in 1968.

Along with Mitsubishi Bank, Mitsubishi Corporation played a central role in international trading for other constituents of the former Mitsubishi &quot;zaibatsu&quot; during the postwar era, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Mitsubishi Motor Company, forming a major &quot;keiretsu&quot; business group centered around the Second Friday Conference (&quot;Kinyo-kai&quot;) of company managers.

In March 1998 the Mitsubishi Corporation received the quarterly Greenwash Award, which alleged that it falsely portrayed its business operations as environmentally friendly. As of 2009, Mitsubishi held between 35% and 40% of the worldwide market for bluefin tuna.

Mitsubishi was the largest Japanese general trading company from the late 1960s until the mid-1980s; after falling to fifth place in 1986, it embarked on a series of large overseas acquisitions together with other companies in the Mitsubishi group. By 2015 Mitsubishi was again the top-ranked general trading company by net earnings. However, Mitsubishi saw its first postwar net loss in the fiscal year ended March 2016, amid a slowdown in the Chinese economy and a slump in the commodity markets, causing Mitsubishi to lose its #1 position to Itochu.

In November, 2019, Mitsubishi Corporation stated that it will buy Eneco, a company that focuses on renewable energy, in a deal valuing the Dutch energy firm at $4.52 billion.

Berkshire Hathaway acquired over 5% of the stock in the company, along with four other Japanese trading houses, over the 12-month period ending in August 2020.

In February 2024, TVS Mobility, a distribution and after-sales company, entered into a joint venture with Mitsubishi. TVS Mobility will be renamed TVS Vehicle Mobility Solution (TVS VMS), Mitsubishi will take a 32% stake in the new business by investing ₹300 crore (₹3 billion) and will enter the Indian automotive market.

In December 2024, Mitsubishi Corporation reported a financial loss due to unauthorized trading activities. The company&#x27;s Singapore-based petroleum unit, Petro-Diamond Singapore, incurred losses of approximately $90 million (13.2 billion yen) from derivatives trading. This incident occurred when a trader who was responsible for crude oil derivatives for China allegedly manipulated the unit&#x27;s risk management system and conducted unauthorized trades since January. Mitsubishi Corporation stated that they discovered the issue in mid-November during a routine middle office review. The trader in question was fired and reported to the police. The company has also filed a complaint against the trader and is considering taking further legal action.

Mitsubishi was the subject of a boycott by the Rainforest Action Network for its role in the destruction of rainforests through its forestry activities.

== Business segments ==
Mitsubishi Corporation businesses are divided into eight business sections:

<doc id="455016" wikidata="Q1282314" url="?curid=455016" title="Akosombo Dam">
<text>The Akosombo Dam, also known as the Volta Dam, is a hydroelectric dam on the Volta River in southeastern Ghana in the Akosombo gorge and part of the Volta River Authority. The construction of the dam flooded part of the Volta River Basin and led to the subsequent creation of Lake Volta. Lake Volta is the largest man-made lake in the world by surface area. It covers , which is 3.6% of Ghana&#x27;s land area. With a volume of 148 cubic kilometers, Lake Volta is the world&#x27;s third largest man-made lake by volume; the largest being Lake Kariba which contains 185 cubic kilometers of water.

The primary purpose of the Akosombo Dam was to provide electricity for the aluminium industry. The Akosombo Dam was called &quot;the largest single investment in the economic development plans of Ghana.&quot; The dam is significant for providing the majority of both Togo and Benin&#x27;s electricity, although the construction of the Adjarala Dam (on Togo&#x27;s Mono River) hopes to reduce these countries&#x27; reliance on imported electricity. The dam&#x27;s original electrical output was , which was upgraded to in a retrofit project that was completed in 2006.

The flooding that created the Lake Volta reservoir displaced many people and had a significant impact on the local environment, including seismic activity that led to coastal erosion; a changed hydrology caused microclimatic changes with less rain and higher temperatures. The soil surrounding the lake is less fertile than the soil under it, and heavy agricultural use has required the use of fertilizers, which in turn has led to eutrophication, which caused, among others, the explosive growth of an invasive weed that renders water navigation and transportation difficult, and form a habitat for the vectors of water-borne illnesses such as bilharzia, river blindness and malaria. Resettlement of the displaced inhabitants proved complex and in some cases unsuccessful; traditional farming practices disappeared and poverty increased. 

== Design ==
The dam was conceived in 1915 by geologist Albert Kitson, but no plans were drawn until the 1940s. The development of the Volta River Basin was proposed in 1949, but because funds were insufficient, the American company Volta Aluminum Company (Valco) lent money to Ghana so that the dam could be constructed. President Kwame Nkrumah adopted the Volta River hydropower project and commissioned Australian architect Kenneth Scott to design a residence for him overlooking the dam. 

The dam is long and high, comprising a high rock-fill embankment dam. It has a base width of and a structural volume of . The reservoir created by the dam, Lake Volta, has a capacity of and a surface area of . The lake is long. Maximum lake level is and minimum is . On the east side of the dam are two adjacent spillways that can discharge about of water. Each spillway contains six -wide and -tall steel floodgates.

The dam&#x27;s power plant contains six Francis turbines. Each turbine is supplied with water via a long and diameter penstock with a maximum of of hydraulic head afforded.

The final proposal outlined the building of an aluminum smelter at Tema, a dam constructed at Akosombo to power the smelter, and a network of power lines installed through southern Ghana. The aluminum smelter was expected to eventually provide the revenue necessary for establishing local bauxite mining and refining, which would allow aluminum production without importing foreign alumina. Development of the aluminum industry within Ghana was dependent upon the proposed hydroelectric power. The proposed project&#x27;s aluminum smelter was overseen by the American company Kaiser Aluminum and is operated by Valco. The smelter received its financial investment from Valco shareholders, with the support of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. However, Valco did not invest without first requiring assurances from Ghana&#x27;s government, such as company exemptions from taxes on trade and discounted purchases of electricity. The estimated total cost of the project was $258 million.

== Construction ==

In May 1960, the Ghana government called for tenders for construction of the hydroelectric dam. In 1961, an Italian consortium, Impregilo which had just completed the Kariba Dam, won the contract. In 1961, the Volta River Authority (VRA) was established by Ghana&#x27;s Parliament through the passage of the Volta River Development Act. The VRA&#x27;s fundamental operations were structured by six Board members and Nkrumah as chairman. The VRA&#x27;s primary task is to manage the development of the Volta River Basin, which included the construction and supervision of the dam, the power station and the power transmission network. The VRA is responsible for the reservoir impounded by the dam, fishing within the lake, lake transportation and communication, and the welfare of those surrounding the lake.

The dam was built between 1961 and 1965. Its development was undertaken by the Ghanaian government and funded 25% by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of the World Bank, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Impreglio carried out the dredging of the river bed and dewatering of the channel, and completed the dam a month earlier than scheduled despite flooding of the Volta River in 1963 which delayed work over three months. Between 1961 and 1966, 28 workers of Impregilo died during the construction of the dam. Memorials in Akosombo township and St. Barbara Catholic Church have been put up in their honor.

The construction of the Akosombo Dam resulted in the flooding of part of the Volta River Basin and its upstream fields, and in the creation of Lake Volta which covers 3.6% of Ghana&#x27;s total land area. Lake Volta was formed between 1962 and 1966 and necessitated the relocation of about 80,000 people, who represented 1% of the population. People of 700 villages were relocated into 52 resettlement villages two years prior to the dam&#x27;s completion; the resettlement program was under the direction of the VRA. Two percent of the resettlement population were riparian fishers, and most were subsistence farmers. The Eastern Region of Ghana and the populations incorporated within its districts were most subject to the project&#x27;s effects.

== Power generation ==
The dam provides electricity to Ghana and its neighboring West African countries, including Togo and Benin. Initially 20% of Akosombo Dam&#x27;s electric output (serving 70% of national demand) was provided to Ghanaians in the form of electricity, the remaining 80% was generated for Valco. The Ghana government was compelled, by contract, to pay for over 50% of the cost of Akosombo&#x27;s construction, but the country was allowed only 20% of the power generated. Some commentators are concerned that this is an example of neocolonialism. In recent years the production from the Valco plant has declined allowing capacity at Akosombo to be used to service growing domestic demand.

Initially, the dam&#x27;s power production capabilities greatly exceeded actual demand; while the demand since the dam&#x27;s inception has resulted in the doubling of hydropower production. Ghana&#x27;s industrial and economic expansion triggered higher demand for power, beyond the Akosombo&#x27;s power plant capabilities. By 1981, a smaller dam was built at Kpong, downstream from Akosombo, upgrades to Akosombo became necessary to maintain hydropower output. 

Increasing demands for power exceed what can be provided by the current infrastructure. Power demands, along with unforeseen environmental trends, have resulted in rolling blackouts and major power outages. An overall trend of lower lake levels has been observed, sometimes below the level required for operation of the generators.

In the beginning of 2007, concerns were expressed over the electricity supply from the dam because of low water levels in the Lake Volta reservoir. During the latter half of 2007, much of this concern abated when heavy rain fell in the catchment area of Volta River. In 2010, the highest-ever water level was recorded at the dam. This necessitated the opening of the flood gates at a reservoir elevation of and, for several weeks, water was spilled from the lake, causing some flooding downstream.

== Impacts ==

The Akosombo Dam benefited some industrial and economic activities from the addition of lake transportation, increased fishing, new farming activities along the shoreline, and tourism. 

=== Biological habitat ===

In the time following the construction of the dam, there has been a steady decline in agricultural productivity along the lake and the associated tributaries. The land surrounding Lake Volta is not nearly as fertile as the formerly cultivated land residing underneath the lake, and heavy agricultural activity has since exhausted the already inadequate soils. Downstream agricultural systems are losing soil fertility without the periodic floods that brought nutrients to the soil before the natural river flow was halted by the dam. The growth of commercially intensive agriculture has produced a rise in fertilizer run-off into the river. This, along with run-off from nearby cattle stocks and sewage pollution, has caused eutrophication of the river waters. The nutrient enrichment, in combination with the low water movement, has allowed for the invasion of aquatic weeds (&quot;Ceratophyllum&quot;). These weeds have become a formidable challenge to water navigation and transportation.

=== Human welfare ===
The presence of &quot;Ceratophyllum&quot; along the lake and within the tributaries has resulted in even greater detriment to local human health. The weeds provide the necessary habitat for black-fly, mosquitoes and snails, which are the vectors of water-borne illnesses such as bilharzia, river blindness and malaria. Since the installation of the dam, these diseases have increased markedly. In particular, resettlement villages have shown an increase in disease prevalence since the establishment of Lake Volta, and a village&#x27;s likelihood of infection corresponds to its proximity to the lake. Children and fishermen have been especially hard hit by this rise of disease prevalence. Additionally, the degradation of aquatic habitat has resulted in the decline of shrimp and clam populations. The physical health of local communities has been diminished from this loss of shellfish populations, as they provided an essential source of dietary protein. Likewise, the rural and industrial economies have experienced financial losses associated with the decimation of river aquaculture.

Increased human migration within the area has been driven by poverty and unfavorable resettlement conditions. This migration exacerbated the spread of HIV and has led to its heightened prevalence within Volta Basin communities. The districts of Manya Krobo and Yilo Krobo, which lie within the southwest portion of the Volta Basin, are predominantly indigenous communities and they have a disproportionate prevalence of HIV, showing how local factors have impacted these districts. Commercial sex work blossomed in response to the thousands of male workers that were in the area to build the dam. Ten percent of the females of child-bearing age from these two districts migrated out of their districts during this time. In 1986, &quot;90% of AIDS victims in Ghana were women, and 96% of them had recently lived outside the country&quot;.

=== Socioeconomics ===
The loss of land experienced by the 80,000 people forcibly relocated meant the loss of their primary economic activities from fishing and agriculture, loss of their homes, loss of their family grave sites, loss of community stability, and the eventual loss of important social values. The resettlement program demonstrated the social complexities involved in establishing &quot;socially cohesive and integrated&quot; communities. Insufficient planning resulted in the relocation of communities into areas that did not suit their former way of life and traditions. The loss of the naturally fertile soils beneath Lake Volta impacted traditional farming practices. The poor living conditions provided within the resettlement villages is evident from the reductions in population since resettlement. One resettlement village in particular experienced a greater than 50% population reduction in the 23 years following relocation. Increased economic risks and experiences of poverty are associated with those communities most impacted by the Volta River&#x27;s development. The extensive human migration and degradation of natural resources within the Volta-basin area are caused by poverty in conjunction with population pressure.

=== Physical environment ===
Reservoir-induced seismicity has been recorded because of the crustal re-adjustments from the added weight of the water within Lake Volta. There is an eastward shift of the river&#x27;s mouth from the changes to the river&#x27;s delta, and this has led to continuing coastal erosion. The changes in the river hydrology have altered the local heat budget which has caused microclimatic changes such as decreasing rain and higher mean monthly temperatures. All of these larger scale environmental impacts compound the problems surrounding disruptions to local economic activities and the associated difficult human welfare conditions. A case study by the International Federation of Surveyors indicated that the dam has had a significant impact on the shoreline erosion of the barrier separating the Keta Lagoon from the sea. Dr. Isaac Boateng has calculated the reduction of fluvial sediment as being from 71 million cubic metres per year to as little as 7 million cubic metres per year.

== Spillage ==

Until 2023, the last time Akosombo dam community experienced flooding as a result of controlled spillage of the dam was in 2010.

On 15 September 2023, the Volta River Authority (VRA) initiated a controlled spillage of water from the Akosombo and Kpong dams situated in the Eastern Region. This controlled spillage led to flooding in communities located along the lower Volta Basin leading to power interruptions. Many victims lost their belongings and livelihood due to the floods. The losses included farmlands, houses and properties which were destroyed by the floods.

<text>Alpha Phi Omega (), commonly known as APO, but also A-Phi-O and A-Phi-Q, is a coeducational service fraternity. It is the largest collegiate fraternity in the United States, with chapters at over 350 campuses, an active membership of over 25,000 students, and over 500,000 alumni members. There are also 250 chapters in the Philippines, one in Australia, and one in Canada. The 500,000th member was initiated in the &quot;Rho Pi chapter&quot; of Alpha Phi Omega at the University of California, San Diego.

Alpha Phi Omega is a national co-ed service fraternity organized to provide community service, leadership development, and social opportunities for college students. The purpose of the fraternity is &quot;to assemble college students in a National Service Fraternity in the fellowship of principles derived from the Scout Oath and Scout Law of the Boy Scouts of America; to develop Leadership, to promote Friendship, and to provide Service to humanity; and to further the freedom that is our national, educational, and intellectual heritage.&quot; Alpha Phi Omega&#x27;s primary focus is to provide volunteer service within four areas: service to the community, service to the campus, service to the fraternity, and service to the nation and world.

Being primarily a service organization, Alpha Phi Omega does not operate nor maintain a fraternity house as lodging quarters for members or any other persons. However, a chapter may maintain rooms for meetings at the discretion of its members. Alpha Phi Omega does not restrict its members from being members of any other organization.

==History==

Alpha Phi Omega was founded on the 2nd floor of Brainerd Hall, now Hogg Hall, at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania on December 16, 1925, by Frank Reed Horton and thirteen other students who were former Boy Scouts or scouters. The fraternity&#x27;s initial objective was to continue participating in the ideals of scouting at the college level. 

In addition to Horton, other founding brothers were Everett William Probst, Ephraim Moyer Detwiler Jr., Thane Sanford Cooley, William Taylor Wood, Lewis Burnett Blair, Gordon Minnier Looney, Donald LeRoy Terwilliger, William Weber Highberger, Robert Jefferson Green, Donald H. Fritts, Ellsworth Stewart Dobson, George Axel Olsen, and Herbert Heinrich. Six advisors were also inducted: Lafayette President John H. MacCracken, Dean Donald B. Prentice, Professors D. Arthur Hatch, and Harry T. Spengler; one local scouting official, Herbert G. Horton, and one national Scouting official, the national director of relationships for the Boy Scouts of America, Ray O. Wyland. The founders insisted that all those gaining memberships must pledge to uphold the fraternity&#x27;s three cardinal principles of leadership, friendship, and service. Of these founding members, several made significant contributions to APO that are still recognized today. Everett Probst designed the pin and coat of arms, Thane S. Cooley suggested the hand clasp during the toast song, and Elsworth Dobson and Gordon M. Looney helped write the constitution and bylaws.

Alpha Phi Omega became a national fraternity on January 11, 1927, with the founding of the &quot;Beta chapter&quot; at University of Pittsburgh. Horton served as supreme grand master from the founding of the fraternity until the 1931 convention. Eighteen chapters were founded during this period. At the 1931 convention, H. Roe Bartle was elected as supreme grand master (title changed to national president in 1934) and served through World War II, stepping down at the 1946 convention. During his time as president, the number of chapters grew to 109. Early in his term (October 1931), Alpha Phi Omega was formally recognized by the Boy Scouts of America.

===Beginnings of an international fraternity===
The most rapid growth of the fraternity was in the post-war years. By 1950, Alpha Phi Omega had 227 chapters in the United States. The first chapter outside the US was organized in the Philippines that year. Many Filipinos were active in the Boy Scouts. Sol Levy, an APO member from University of Washington and Professional Scouter, introduced the organization to Filipino Scouts. Librado I. Ureta, a graduate student at Far Eastern University in Manila, was among the audience. Inspired by Levy&#x27;s words, he read the publications and shared them with fellow Eagle Scouts and students on the FEU campus. He asked their opinion about Levy&#x27;s desire, and the response was good. On March 2, 1950, the Alpha Phi Omega International Service Fraternity was chartered on campus.

Alpha Phi Omega grew rapidly in the Philippines. By its third year, seven chapters had been chartered at Manila and Visayan schools, and it was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a nonstock, nonprofit, and non-dividend corporation. Alpha Phi Omega (Phil.) Inc. was the first branch of the fraternity to be chartered outside the United States.

===Membership in Alpha Phi Omega-USA opened to women===

The fraternity was opened fully to women in 1976. All members are called &quot;Brothers,&quot; regardless of gender. The Fraternity views &quot;Brothers&quot; as a gender-neutral term. Before women were allowed to join, several smaller sororities, parallel in ideals but independent in structure, were formed for women who had been Camp Fire Girls or Girl Scouts, including Gamma Sigma Sigma and Omega Phi Alpha. Several Alpha Phi Omega chapters started &quot;little sister&quot; groups, some of which formed separate organizations (e.g., Jewels of Tau, Phyettes, etc.).

The first step in paving the way for women to join Alpha Phi Omega was the Constitutional Convention in 1967, which removed the requirement that members have affiliation with the Boy Scouts of America.

Starting at the 1970 national convention, co-ed membership was sponsored by the &quot;Zeta chapter&quot; and co-sponsored by several other chapters but failed to reach the two-thirds majority at the national conventions, which was required to alter the organization&#x27;s bylaws. Zeta went coed that year with B. Hesselmyer being the first official woman in the national fraternity with the knowledge and help of a past national president and a current board member. Some chapters (like &quot;Delta Rho&quot; at Rutgers University and &quot;Alpha Tau&quot; at Butler University) went co-ed before 1976, although the national by-laws did not allow it. They did so by registering women by using only the first letter of their first name. Many chapters that attempted to register women with the national office would receive the paperwork and fees back for women initiates. The &quot;Alpha Chi chapter&quot; at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ran their own printing press and thus was able to generate certificates and membership cards for their female initiates before 1976.

At the 1974 national convention, the fraternity allowed chapters to have women as affiliate members of the fraternity, and during the 1976 national convention in Atlanta, Georgia, the decision was made to formally welcome females as full members of the fraternity. As with many major changes, this one caused a great deal of dismay, especially among several long-established chapters. Many of these chapters threatened to disassociate with the national fraternity if they were forced to become co-ed. To preserve the unity of the fraternity as a whole, the amendment was crafted such that it did not require existing chapters to admit women as members, although all new chapters were to be coed. It was felt that over time, all would go coed. This &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; was formalized in a resolution at the 1998 national convention and includes the following points: &quot;The fraternity continues to encourage all chapters and petitioning groups to open their membership to all students. All chapters and petitioning groups have the right to choose their members using objective and open policies that are consistent with the fraternity&#x27;s governing documents, the rules of the host institutions that they serve, and the traditions of that chapter, if any. Single-gender chapters chartered before the 1976 national convention may remain single-gender unless they become inactive or coeducational. All petitioning groups seeking to charter or re-charter will be and remain co-educational. Allowing women members in 1976 reversed the continuing steep decline in membership of the Fraternity and started a growth cycle in the fraternity.

===Requirement of open membership===
At the July 2005 national Board of Directors meeting, a resolution was passed: &quot;The actions of the 1976 and 1998 national conventions have attempted to clarify the Fraternity&#x27;s open membership policy...The National Board is charged with...enforcing the membership policies of the Fraternity as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws, and upon advice of legal counsel, all chapters must practice open membership without regard of gender&quot;. A decision by the 2006 national convention on December 30, 2006, has essentially upheld the Board&#x27;s previous resolution, adding additional clarifications to the transitional process for the all-male chapters, including a timeline for completion of their transition to co-educational status by the 2008 national convention, and the establishment of a committee consisting of active members and alumni to assist with the process. In the spring of 2008, the &quot;Sigma Xi chapter&quot; at the University of Maine formally disassociated from the national fraternity, forming a new fraternity: Alpha Delta. They cited that their action was due to an &quot;ideological split&quot;, claiming that the national fraternity allowed female members to join and took away the student focus. In addition, Brothers from the &quot;Zeta Theta chapter&quot; at Drexel University, the &quot;Pi Chi chapter&quot; at Duquesne University, and the &quot;Psi Delta chapter&quot; at the University of Maine at Machias have joined this new fraternity.

On December 30, 2006, the 2006 national convention in Louisville, Kentucky, elected the first female National President of the organization, Maggie Katz. Brother Katz was re-elected, without contest, on December 30, 2008, in Boston, Massachusetts.

=== International Council ===
The International Council of Alpha Phi Omega (ICAPO) was created at the 1994 Dallas-Fort Worth Alpha Phi Omega (USA) national convention with the signing of the charter document. Meetings followed at the 1995 Alpha Phi Omega (Philippines) and the 1996 Phoenix Alpha Phi Omega – USA national convention. At the 1996 convention, a formal set of operating policies for the council was signed, and the first officers were elected. ICAPO meetings now occur in conjunction with Alpha Phi Omega national conventions in the US and the Philippines.

==Symbols and traditions==
Alpha Phi Omega&#x27;s motto is &quot;Be a Leader, Be a Friend, Be of Service&quot;. Its Cardinal principles or pillars are Leadership, Friendship, and Service. The fraternity&#x27;s colors are royal blue and old gold. Its symbol is the golden eagle. Its flower is the forget-me-not, and its tree is the sturdy oak. The fraternity&#x27;s jewel is the diamond.

=== Publications ===
The fraternity&#x27;s official publication is the &quot;Torch &amp; Trefoil.&quot; First published as the &quot;Lightbearer&quot; in February 1927, the name was changed to the &quot;Torch &amp; Trefoil&quot; by the decision of the Fifth Alpha Phi Omega national convention in December 1934. The new name was from the Torch as the emblem of Education and the Trefoil as the emblem of Scouting. A version is published quarterly by the national organization of the United States, as well as a separate version by the national organization of the Republic of the Philippines.

The &quot;Lightbearer&quot; has been published since 1966 as a separate daily publication during Alpha Phi Omega national conventions and distributed to convention attendees.

The monthly mailing from the fraternity to its chapters was the &quot;national convention Bulletin&quot; from 2004 to 2008.

==Programs==
The programs of the fraternity are centered around developing its three cardinal principles: Leadership, Friendship, and Service. Many chapters plan several local service projects throughout the year, including blood drives, tutoring, charity fundraising events, Scouting events, used book exchanges, Boy Scout Merit Badge days, campus escort initiatives, and housing construction/rehabilitation. Signature projects include the annual National Service Week in the first full week of November and the Global Spring Youth Service Day in April. Many of the operations of individual chapters are left to their discretion, though most chapters have membership requirements which require a certain number of hours of service each semester. In the United States, on April 14, 2003, the fraternity received Daily Point of Light Award #2397 in recognition of its members, who give unselfishly of their time and energy daily and who cumulative donate an average of over 300,000 hours of community service each semester.

===APO Leads===
APO Leads (stylized as APO LEADS) is a leadership development program organized by the national organization of Alpha Phi Omega in the United States. The APO Leads program consists of five individual modular components of leadership development. Each of these modular components focuses on skills that will help the participant be a successful leader and team member in Alpha Phi Omega and life. The five components of APO Leads are Launch, Explore, Achieve, Discover, and Serve. Launch is a pre-requisite for participation in any of the other four courses. After the series of courses, the participant will have a set of transferable skills that apply to Alpha Phi Omega, to the working world, as well as to leadership in other organizations. APO Leads has its roots in an earlier program, the Leadership Development Workshop (LDW). The LDW was an all-day, eight-hour leadership development course that was offered to members during the 1980s and 1990s. It was reorganized into the current APO Leads program, which was rolled out in 2002.

===National Service Week===
In the United States, Alpha Phi Omega organizes National Service Week (NSW), a project collaboration encompassing all chapters across the nation. The original concept of a &quot;national service project&quot; dates back to the 1948 national convention, in which delegates approved the rebuilding of the Scout Hut at Hallows Church in London after World War II. There were several other national service efforts outside of NSW, including a recent international book drive in 2001, in which chapters collected approximately 100,000 books for schools in the Philippines.

NSW began in 1987 as National Service Day and later expanded to National Service Week in 1997 to allow for greater flexibility and increased participation while retaining the sense of unity of the original concept. NSW is always held during the first full week of November.

A theme for NSW is selected by the delegates of each national convention. The first service week, in 1987, was themed around &quot;Diabetes &amp; Other Chronic Illnesses&quot;. The 2014 national convention determined that the National Service Week program of emphasis for 2015–2016 shall be &quot;Literacy and Learning for all&quot;, with a specific focus on &quot;Improving Literacy for Adults&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Improving Literacy in Youth&quot; in 2016.

===Spring Youth Service Day===
Spring Youth Service Day is Alpha Phi Omega&#x27;s effort to participate in the Global Youth Service Day project with its partner organization, Youth Service America. During one weekend in April, millions of youth participated in this project, which bills itself as the largest service event in the world. Projects include tutoring young children, disaster relief, voter registration, nutritional awareness, distributing HIV/AIDS prevention materials, and more. Global Youth Service Day supports youth on a lifelong path of service and civic engagement and educates the public, the media, and elected officials about the role of youth as community leaders.

==Organization==

===International===
The International Council of Alpha Phi Omega (ICAPO) is the coordinating council of the Alpha Phi Omega National Organizations. During the 1980s, contact between Alpha Phi Omega (USA) and Alpha Phi Omega (Philippines) increased. National presidents Earle Herbert (USA) and Carlos &quot;Caloy&quot; Caliwara (Philippines), as well as other leaders in the two organizations concluded there was a need for an international coordinating body to promote the ideals of the fraternity around the world.

As stated in the charter of ICAPO: &quot;The purpose of the ICAPO is to promote the principles and ideals of Alpha Phi Omega, as originally exemplified by Frank Reed Horton, around the world. To this end, the Council aids in introducing and establishing collegiate-based Alpha Phi Omega organizations in countries where it is not yet located and assists in institutionalizing Alpha Phi Omega organizations in countries where it is currently introduced or established. It serves as an official link among the variously established independent national Alpha Phi Omega organizations and works to promote a deeper understanding and an increased working relationship among the independent national organizations.&quot;

While the ICAPO binds both Alpha Phi Omega (USA) and Alpha Phi Omega (Philippines) into one larger international organization, the respective national organizations operate as individual organizations with a high degree of autonomy. Alpha Phi Omega (USA) has committed to the establishment of Alpha Phi Omega in Canada, and Alpha Phi Omega (Philippines) has committed to the establishment of Alpha Phi Omega in Australia.

===United States===
In the United States, Alpha Phi Omega is organized into five levels.

* There are over 350 chapters and a number of Alumni Associations. Each chapter has student brothers who perform service and elect their officers, as well as faculty, scouting, and service advisors drawn from the college and local communities. Each chapter usually has a sectional representative appointed by the local sectional chair.
* There are around sixty sections consisting of geographically close chapters. Each is headed by a sectional chair, who is elected to a one-year term at each section&#x27;s annual conference. Many sectional chairs have a group of volunteer sectional staff, usually consisting of alumni of various chapters.
* There are eighteen regions consisting of geographically close sections and chapters. Each is headed by an elected regional chair who is a member of the national operations council and heads a group of volunteer regional staff, usually consisting of alumni of various chapters. Each chair is elected by the chapters in that region.
* There is the national board of directors, comprising the elected national officers and others. These officers are elected at the biennial national convention to two-year terms by student and alumni delegates. The board includes the national president, national vice-president, national treasurer, six members-at-large, and four appointed members. Appointed officials include an additional at large director, legal counsel, immediate past national president, any past national president, and the National Executive Director.
* There is the national operations council, comprising the elected regional chairs and the appointed program chairs that include: Alumni Development, DEIAB+, Extension, International Relations Chair, Leadership Development, Membership, Risk Management, Service, and Volunteer Recruitment.
* The supreme authority is the national convention, which meets every two years. It consists of one or two voting delegates from each chapter, one alumni voting delegate from each region, and all the members of the national board of directors and operations council. These voting delegates consider changes to the fraternity&#x27;s policies, bylaws, and articles of incorporation for the national board of directors to handle between conventions. All members of the fraternity are invited to attend to participate in leadership development seminars, service projects, and fellowship events.

====Chapters====
Alpha Phi Omega of the United States has 738 chartered chapters. It currently has 367 active chapters, fourteen petitioning groups, nineteen interest groups, and 343 that are inactive. (Petitioning and interest groups include both those at schools that have previously had active chapters and those that have not.) In addition, Alpha Phi Omega has sixteen charters at schools that have closed or merged with another school with an older charter.

====National office====

In the United States, the fraternity is headquartered out of a national office located at 14901 East 42nd Street, Independence, Missouri 64055–7347. The building was dedicated on November 17, 1990, following a four-year fundraising campaign during the 1980s. Fundraising for the building continued during the early 1990s, through matching gifts and a national fundraising event entitled, &quot;Burn the Mortgage&quot;, raising over $28,000. Thanks to these donations, the fraternity paid the ten-year mortgage in only four years, and national president Jerry Schroeder ceremonially burned the mortgage at the 1994 national convention in Dallas – Fort Worth, Texas.

The move to the Kansas City area was decided by the 1931 national convention. Past locations of the national office in the United States include:

===Philippines===
The national organization of Alpha Phi Omega in the Philippines maintains a four-layer administrative structure:
* Collegiate chapters
* Regional Development Directorates
* National Executive Board
* General Assembly

====Chapters====
Alpha Phi Omega of the Philippines has charters (either fraternity, sorority or both) at 243 colleges and universities.

====National Office====
The National Office for Alpha Phi Omega of the Philippines is at 301-A Two Seventy Midtower Condominium, 270 Ermin Garcia Street, Barangay Silangan, Cubao, Quezon City. Past locations of the Alpha Phi Omega of the Philippines national office follow.

===Australia===

Alpha Phi Omega currently has a chapter at James Cook University.

===Canada===
Alpha Phi Omega has a chapter at University of British Columbia. The group at UBC became a Petitioning Group on July 18, 2015. They chartered on December 13, 2015. national conventions in Canada will remain an extension of Alpha Phi Omega USA until there is a presence on five campuses.

==Membership==
Alpha Phi Omega of the United States offers active membership (brotherhood) to be granted to all students enrolled at colleges and universities with active chapters of Alpha Phi Omega. Individual chapters are granted flexibility in determining the level of activity of Graduate Students at their institution. Honorary membership may be granted by either active chapters or by the National Board of Directors.

Until the 1967 Constitutional Convention, current or former membership in Scouting was a requirement to become an active brother. For example, in the Alpha Phi Omega National Constitution in 1957:

Members were never required to have been Boy Scouts. For example, Bill Clinton was a Cub Scout, but not a Scout while growing up and was able to join Alpha Phi Omega as a student. The bylaws also allowed for men to qualify by registering with their local council as a merit badge counselor in the College Scouter Reserve or other similar positions.

In 1976 the delegates at the national convention amended the bylaws allowing women to join the fraternity. At the time the changes allowed individual chapters to convert to allow men and women but the choice was not forced on chapters, any chapter that was chartered or rechartered at the time was required to be coeducational. In July 2005, a Board of Directors Resolution was adopted clarifying the National Fraternity&#x27;s membership policies by mandating coeducational membership. The resolution was upheld at the 2006 Alpha Phi Omega National Convention in Louisville, Kentucky. Per this resolution, the all-male chapters would be required to comply with the mandate or lose national organizational recognition. This lead to all active chapters becoming coeducational and a few leaving and forming Alpha Delta a fraternity still restricted to men.

In addition to being coeducational, one thing that further differentiates Alpha Phi Omega from social fraternities is that its national bylaws restrict its chapters from maintaining fraternity houses to serve as residences for their members. This also encourages members of social fraternities and sororities that have houses to join APO as well.

==National conventions==


National conventions in Alpha Phi Omega are biennial gatherings of the respective national organization of the fraternity, in which official business is conducted, and brothers from the various chapters in the organization meet to share ideas, expanding leadership, friendship, and service. In the very early years, decisions of the National Fraternity were conducted by mail. The first actual assembly of delegates in a convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 1–2, 1931. Seven of the fraternity&#x27;s eighteen chapters were represented at this convention by a total of 23 students and advisors.

Alpha Phi Omega of the United States hosts biennial national conventions during even-numbered years. Conventions were not held in 1942 and 1944 due to World War II, and a special Constitutional Convention was held in 1967. Alpha Phi Omega of the Philippines conducts biennial national conventions in odd-numbered years.

In the US, national conventions are officially called to order by an opening ceremony in which the Eternal Flame of Service is brought forth by members of the Delta Omega chapter at the University of Houston. This tradition was started after the twenty-first national convention in Dallas, Texas. In the early hours of December 30, 1970, the delegates of the Delta Omega chapter met in a ceremony in the suite of H. Roe Bartle, with the newly elected members of the National Board of Directors and National President Aubrey B. Hamilton. Bartle lit a small blue candle that he, in turn, used to light a hurricane lamp, which was then passed from the blue candle to each of the board members&#x27; candles. He then joined the board members to light two four-foot candles. The flame was then taken to Houston and allowed to burn while awaiting the completion of the Eternal Flame site.

Convention attendance has grown considerably through the years. The largest convention attendance in the US to date has been 2,316 in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2002, and the largest number of chapters represented was 235 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2000.

<text>John Forbes (1 September 1950 – 23 January 1998) was an Australian poet.

Forbes was born in Melbourne, but during his childhood his family lived in northern Queensland, Malaya and New Guinea. He went to Sydney University, and his circle of friends included the poets Robert Adamson, Martin Johnston, and John Tranter. It was at this time that the work of the American poets Ted Berrigan, John Ashbery and Frank O&#x27;Hara made a strong and lasting impression on him.

He returned to live in Melbourne in the late 1980s, where he became the poetry editor of &quot;Scripsi&quot;. His friends around this time included the poets Gig Ryan, Laurie Duggan and Alan Wearne.

Forbes died in Melbourne of a heart attack, aged 47.

<doc id="455030" wikidata="Q5280321" url="?curid=455030" title="Direct deposit">
<text>A direct deposit (or direct credit), in banking, is a deposit of money by a payer directly into a payee&#x27;s bank account. Direct deposits are most commonly made by businesses in the payment of salaries and wages and for the payment of suppliers&#x27; accounts, but the facility can be used for payments for any purpose, such as payment of bills, taxes, and other government charges.

When making a direct deposit by means of electronic funds transfer, the payer also normally enters reference information to make it easy for the payee to recognise who made the deposit and which account to credit. The reference may be an account number, an invoice number, the payer&#x27;s name, or some other meaningful identification.

==Alternatives==
If a funds recipient does not have a bank account, but a payer is obligated to pay by electronic funds transfer, alternative payment arrangements need to be made. For example, a US law of 1996 required the federal government to make electronic payments, such as direct deposit, available by 1999. As a part of its implementation, the US Treasury Department paired with Comerica Bank and MasterCard in 2008 to offer the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card, which can be used to make payments to federal benefit recipients who do not have a bank account.

<doc id="455033" wikidata="Q155111" url="?curid=455033" title="Iskander Mirza">
<text>Iskander Ali Mirza (13 November 189913 November 1969) was a Pakistani politician, statesman and military general who served as the Dominion of Pakistan&#x27;s fourth and last governor-general of Pakistan from 1955 to 1956, and then as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan&#x27;s first president from 1956 to 1958.

Mirza was educated at the University of Bombay before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After military service in the British Indian Army, he joined the Indian Political Service and spent the most of his career as a political agent in the Western region of British India until elevated as joint secretary at the Ministry of Defence in 1946. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947 as a result of the Partition of British India, Mirza was appointed as the first Defence Secretary by prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan, only to oversee the military efforts in the first war with India in 1947, followed by the failed secession in Balochistan in 1948. In 1954, he was appointed as the Governor of his home province of East Bengal by Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra to control the law and order situation sparked by the popular language movement in 1952, but was later elevated as Interior Minister in the Bogra administration in 1955.

Playing a crucial role in the ousting of Governor-General Malik Ghulam Muhammad, Mirza assumed his position in 1955 and was elected as the first President of Pakistan when the first Constitution was promulgated in 1956. His presidency, however, was marked with political instability which saw his unconstitutional interferences in the civilian administration that led to the dismissal of four prime ministers in a mere two years. Facing challenges in getting the political endorsements and reelection for the presidency, Mirza surprisingly suspended the writ of the Constitution by imposing martial law against his own party&#x27;s administration governed by Prime Minister Feroz Khan Noon on 8 October 1958, enforcing it through his army commander General Ayub Khan. Three weeks later, General Ayub ousted President Mirza when the situation between them escalated and sent him into exile. Mirza lived in the United Kingdom for the remainder of his life and was buried in Iran in 1969.

His legacy and image are viewed negatively by some Pakistani historians who believe that Mirza was responsible for weakening democracy and causing political instability in the country.

==Origins==

===Ancestral roots and family background===

Sahibzada Iskandar Ali Mirza was born in Murshidabad, Bengal, in India on 13 November 1899, into an elite and wealthy aristocrat family who were titled as Nawab of Bengal and later after 1880, Nawab of Murshidabad. Mirza was the eldest child of Nawab Fateh Ali Mirza and Dilshad Begum (1875–1925).

From his grandfather&#x27;s ancestral roots, he was of Syed Iraqi Arab descent.

The Nawab of Murshidabad family was an influential and wealthy feudal family in Bengal, with close ties to the British monarchy. His father, Fateh Ali Mirza, belonged to the ruling house of Murshidabad, grandson of the first Nawab Mansur Ali Khan. He was the descendant of Mir Jafar.

===Education, military and political service in British India (1920–47)===

==== Education ====

Mirza grew up and completed his schooling in Bombay, attending the Elphinstone College of the University of Bombay, but left the university to attend the Royal Military College in Sandhurst when he was selected by the British Governor-General for the King&#x27;s Commission.

==== Military Service ====

Mirza was the first Indian graduate of the military college, and gained his commission in the British Indian Army as a 2nd Lt. on 16 July 1920. As was customary for newly commissioned British Indian Army officers, he was initially attached for a year to the second battalion of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). On 16 July 1921, he was promoted to lieutenant and was assigned to command a platoon on 30 December 1921.

His military career was spent in the Military Police. In spite of hailing from Bengal, his military career was mostly spent in the violent North-West Frontier Province of India, participating in the Waziristan war in 1920. After the campaign, he was transferred to the 17th Poona Horse (Queen Victoria&#x27;s Own), as an army inspector but left active service to join the Indian Political Service (IPS) in August 1926.

==== Indian Political Service ====

His first assignment was a posting in Aligarh in what is now Uttar Pradesh as an assistant commissioner before posting as a political agent in Hazara in the North West Frontier Province. He received his promotion to captain on 17 October 1927.

During his time spent fighting for the British Empire against Pashtun Freedom Fighters in Waziristan, he learnt to speak Pashto fluently for his deployment in the North-West Frontier. From 1928 to 1933, Mirza spent time as a political agent in the troubled Tribal Belt, having served as an assistant commissioner in the districts of Dera Ismail Khan in April 1928, Tonk in May 1928, Bannu in April 1930, and Nowshera in April 1931. In 1931, Captain Mirza was appointed a district officer and was later posted as deputy commissioner at Hazara in May 1933, where he served for three years until a posting to Mardan as assistant commissioner from October 1936 (deputy commissioner from January 1937). Promoted to major on 16 July 1938, he became the political agent of the Tribal Belt in April 1938, stationed at Khyber. He remained there until 1945.

Mirza was appointed and served as the political agent of Odisha and North West Frontier Province from 1945 until 1946. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 16 July 1946. His ability to run the colonial administrative units had brought him to prominence that prompted the British Indian Government to appoint him as the Joint Defence Secretary of India in 1946. In this position, he was responsible for dividing the British Indian Army into the future armies of Pakistan and India. Around this time, he became closer to Liaquat Ali Khan and began formatting political relations with the politicians of the Muslim League. About him Abdul Ghaffar Khan wrote: &quot;&quot;According to my instructions the mass movement was launched. A Muslim Deputy-Commissioner, Janab Iskander Mirza, avowing his traditional loyalty to the British, excelled his masters, beating to death Syed Akbar, a Khudai Khidmatgar. He went to the extent of poisoning vegetables in a Khudai Khidmatgar camp. Those who ate them were taken seriously ill. I would rather not expose his other crimes but would rather produce him before the Almighty, whom we all have to face on the Day of judgement.&quot;

==Political career in Pakistan==

===Defence Secretary (1947–54)===

He was appointed as the first Defence Secretary in the Liaquat administration by the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, who relied on running the government on the British viceregal model with the close coordination of the civilian bureaucracy, the police, and the military. As Defence Secretary, he oversaw the military efforts in the first war with India in 1947, as well as witnessing the failed secession in Balochistan by Khan of Kalat.

In 1950, Mirza was promoted to two-star rank, having skipped the one-star promotion as brigadier, and upgraded his rank to major-general in the Pakistan Army by the promotion papers approved by Prime Minister Ali Khan. He was appointed as colonel commandant of the Military Police while serving as the Defence secretary in the Liaquat administration. In 1951, Prime minister Ali Khan appointed him as the director of the Department of Kashmir and Afghanistan Affairs (DKA).

His tenure as defense secretary also saw the deployment of Military Police in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) as a result of the Bengali Language Movement, during which the East Pakistan Rifles fatally shot four student activists. Within a short span of time, the Military Police had control of the state and its commanding officer submitted the report of their course of action to Major General Iskander Mirza in 1954.

In 1951, he backed the Liaquat administration&#x27;s decision of appointing the native chiefs of staff of the army, air force, and navy, and dismissed deputation appointments from the British military. For the four-star appointment, the Army GHQ sent the nomination papers to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat that included four-senior major-generals in the race for the army command of the Pakistan Army: Major-General Iftikhar Khan, Major-General Akbar Khan, Major-General Ishfakul Majid, and Major-General N.A.M. Raza.

Initially, it was Major-General Iftikhar Khan who was promoted to four-star rank and selected to be appointed as the first native commander of the army but died in an airplane crash en route after finishing the senior staff officers&#x27; course in the United Kingdom. All three remaining major-generals were bypassed including the recommended senior-most Major-General Akbar Khan and Major-General Ishfakul Majid due to Major-General Mirza&#x27;s lobbying for the army selection when he presented convincing arguments to Prime Minister Ali Khan to promote the junior-most Major-General Ayub Khan to the post despite the fact that his name was not included in the nomination list. Ayub&#x27;s papers of promotion were controversially approved and was appointed as the first native Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army with a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General (acting full General) on 17 January 1951 by Prime Minister Ali Khan.

With Ayub becoming the army chief, it marked a change in the military tradition of preferring native Pakistanis and ending the transitional role of British Army officers. Also in 1951, he helped in elevating Commodore M.S. Choudhri to the promotion to two-star rank, rear-admiral, in order to assume the navy command of the Pakistan Navy, but it was not until in 1953 when Admiral Choudhri took over the command.

===Governorship of East Bengal and Cabinet Minister (1954–55)===

Due to rapid political instability in East Bengal, Mirza was relieved as Defence Secretary and took over the governorship of East Bengal, in an appointment approved by then Governor-General Sir Malik Ghulam on 29 May 1954.

On 1 June 1954, Mirza took over the Government of East Bengal from Chief Minister A. K. Fazlul Huq as part of the governor&#x27;s rule that dismissed the United Front. He imposed martial law, backed by the East Pakistan Rifles, and dismissed the East Bengal Legislative Assembly.

After landing at the then Dacca Airport, Mirza sharply announced in the Bengali language to the Pakistan media representatives, that he would not hesitate to use force in order to establish peace in the province, and personally threatening Maulana Bhashani of shooting him.

Iskander Mirza ruled East Pakistan with an iron fist, having arrested 319–659 political activists in his first week, including Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Yusuf Ali Chowdhury.

By mid-June 1954, the number of arrests reached 1,051, including 33 assembly members and two Dhaka University professors. His authoritative actions had sown a permanent seed of hatred for the Pakistani government in the hearts of the people of East Pakistan. Amid criticism at the public level in Pakistan, Mirza was relieved from the post of the Governorship to East Bengal to Muhammad Shahabuddin in October 1954. On 24 October 1954, he was appointed as Interior Minister in the Bogra administration of Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra. During this time, he had maintained close political ties to the United States&#x27;s establishment and was backed by Governor-General Sir Malik Ghulam for this post, which Mirza only remained at until 7 August 1955.

As an Interior Minister, he provided strong political advocacy for the controversial geopolitical program, One-unit, which he faced strong criticism on by West Pakistan&#x27;s politicians and the public in general.

===Governor-General of Pakistan (1955–56)===

In the Bogra administration, he also took care of the matters of the Commonwealth and Kashmir affairs ministry as he had gained major political influence in the administration in 1955. During this time, Governor-General Malik Ghulam survived another attack of paralysis that made him unable to talk and walk, seeking treatment in the United Kingdom on a two-month leave.

Appointed only as acting acting governor-general since 7 August 1955, Mirza dismissed Sir Malik Ghulam to take over his post on 6 October 1955, and forced Prime Minister Bogra to resign when he appointed him as the Pakistan Ambassador to the United States. On 12 August 1955, he invited Muhammad Ali, the Finance Minister, to take over the government as a prime minister.

==Presidency (1956–58)==

The newly constituted Electoral College unanimously elected Mirza as the first president upon the promulgation of the first set of the Constitution on 23 March 1956. The coalition of the Awami League, the Muslim League, and the Republic Party endorsed his presidency.

The Constitution drives the country&#x27;s system of government towards parliamentarianism, with executive powers vested under the elected Prime Minister while the president served as a ceremonial head of state.

On 12 September 1956, he established and became vice-president of the Republican Party that was in direct conflict with the Muslim League, mainly due to disagreements on the idea of republicanism and conservatism. Unable to keep the substantial pressure on Mirza&#x27;s Republic Party eventually led the Muslim League&#x27;s successful demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Muhammad Ali on 12 September 1956.

Upon these developments, President Mirza invited the Awami League to form the central government that appointed Huseyn Suhrawardy as the Prime Minister, who made an alliance with the Republican Party, to take over charge of the government.

Despite both being ethnic Bengalis and hailing from East Pakistan, the two leaders had very different views of running the central government and both leaders were in brief conflict, causing harm to the unity of the nation. Prime Minister Suhrawardy found it extremely difficult to govern effectively due to the issue of One Unit, alleviating the national economy, and President Mirza&#x27;s constant unconstitutional interference in the Suhrawardy administration.

President Mirza demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Suhrawardy and turned down his request to seek a motion of confidence at the National Assembly. Threatened by President Mirza&#x27;s dismissal, Prime Minister Suhrawardy tendered his resignation on 17 October 1957 and was succeeded by I. I. Chundrigar but he too was forced to resign in a mere two months.

President Mirza had widely lacked the parliamentary spirit, distrusting the civilians to ensure the integrity and sovereignty of the country. His unconstitutional interference in the civil administration made the elected prime ministers effectively unable to function, as he had dismissed four elected prime ministers in a matter of two years. On his last nomination, he appointed Feroz Khan as the seventh Prime Minister of the country, who had been supported by the Awami League and the Muslim League.

===Martial law===

After the legislative elections held in 1954, the Awami League had been successfully negotiating with the Muslim League for a power-sharing agreement to form the national government against the Republican Party.

By 1958, I.I. Chundrigar and A.Q. Khan had successfully reorganized the Muslim League that was threatening the reelection and the political endorsement for Mirza for his second term of the presidency. Furthermore, the Republican Party, presided by Prime Minister Sir Feroze Khan, had been under pressure over the electoral reforms issue at the National Assembly. Upon witnessing these developments, President Mirza ordered the mass mobilization of the military and imposed emergency rule in the country after declaring martial law against his own party&#x27;s administration led by Prime Minister Feroze Khan by abrogating the writ of the Constitution and dissolving the national and provisional assemblies at midnight on 7/8 October 1958.

In the morning of 8 October 1958, President Mirza announced via national radio that he was introducing a new constitution &quot;more suited to the genius of the Pakistan nation&quot;, as he believed democracy was unsuited to Pakistan &quot;with its 15% literacy rate&quot;. Upon abdicating, Mirza took the nation into confidence, saying that:

This martial law imposed by the country&#x27;s first president was the first example of martial law in Pakistan, which would continue until the dissolution of East Pakistan in 1971. Iskander Mirza appointed then-Army Commander of the Pakistan Army, General Ayub Khan, as the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA), which proved his undoing within three weeks.

===Dismissal and end of presidency===

The two-man rule political regime was evolved under President Mirza and his appointed chief martial law administration and then-army chief General Ayub Khan. However, the two men had very different points of view on running the government with the new situation, even though they were responsible for bringing about the change.

President Mirza had not envisaged any change in his previous powers; he wanted to retain the ability to maneuver things in keeping with his own whims. Judging from the situation, the things however had changed as the time and situation both were demanding the complete solution. General Ayub Khan came to an understanding that the real political power rested with the support of the military, and within a week of enforcing martial law, President Mirza realized the delicate position he got himself into. In an interview with &quot;Dawn&quot;, President Mirza regretted his decision saying: &quot;I did not mean to do it&quot; while offering assurances that martial law would be for the shortest possible duration.

In 1958, President Mirza accepted the resignation of Vice-Admiral M.S. Choudhri, replacing him with Vice-Admiral A.R. Khan as the new naval chief but civil-military relations continued to be a dominant factor between President Mirza and General Ayub Khan.

Mirza unilaterally made Ayub Khan Prime Minister and appointed a new cabinet of technocrats for him.

The new administration did not satisfy CMLA Ayub Khan who had more control in the administration than President Mirza. Ayub dispatched the military unit to enter the presidential palace on midnight of 26–27 October 1958 and placed him in an airplane to be exiled to England. Subsequently, Admiral A. R. Khan and four army and air force generals: Azam, Amir, Wajid, and Asghar Khan were instrumental in the dismissal of President Mirza.

==Exile and death==

Exiled in 1959, Mirza lived the remainder of his life in exile in London, England, where he financially struggled running a small Pakistani cuisine hotel until his death. It was reported widely by Pakistani media that despite hailing from a wealthy Nawab and aristocratic family, Mirza lived in poverty in England and his regular income was based on his retirement pension of £3,000 as a former military officer and president. Foreign dignitaries such as Ardeshir Zahedi, Shah of Iran, Lord Inchcape, Lord Hume, and Pakistani billionaires in London made his life in exile tolerable.

At the London hospital where he died, he once said to his wife, Nahid: &quot;We cannot afford medical treatment, so just let me die.&quot;

He died of a heart attack on 13 November 1969, his 70th birthday. Yahya Khan, the president of Pakistan, denied him a burial in East Pakistan. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, sent his personal plane to London to bring President Mirza&#x27;s body to Tehran, where he was given a state funeral. Hundreds of Iranians, including Prime Minister Abbas Hoveyda, and Pakistani expatriates in Iran bade farewell and offered their prayers.

The funeral ceremony was marred by the absence of Iskander Mirza&#x27;s relatives living in Pakistan. The military government barred them from leaving Pakistan in time despite the best efforts of Ardeshir Zahedi, Iran&#x27;s foreign minister, and President Iskander Mirza&#x27;s friends in Pakistan and Iran. There are unfounded rumors that after the Islamic Revolution in Iran (1979), his grave was desecrated.

===Family===

Mirza was married twice: his first marriage took place on 24 November 1922, when he married an Iranian woman, Rifaat Begum (1907–23 March 1967). The couple had two sons and four daughters.

Humayun Mirza is the only surviving son of Iskander Mirza. He was born in Poona, India, and was educated at Doon School. He also studied in the U.K., before moving to the U.S., where he earned his MBA from Harvard. He married Josephine Hildreth, the daughter of Horace Hildreth, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan. He retired from the World Bank in 1988. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland. He is the author of a book &quot;From Plassey to Pakistan: The Family History of Iskander Mirza.&quot; Humayun&#x27;s younger brother, Enver Mirza, had died in a plane crash in 1953.

In October 1954, while in West Pakistan, Mirza&#x27;s second marriage took place in Karachi after he fell in love with an Iranian aristocrat, Naheed Amirteymour (1919–2019), daughter of Amirteymour Kalali. She was a close friend of Begum Nusrat Bhutto. It was this friendship that brought Zulfikar Ali Bhutto into the political arena of Pakistan.

==Legacy==

Iskandar Ali Mirza is often criticized by Pakistani historians for imposing martial law. Historians have noted that Mirza held that Pakistanis &quot;lacked the parliamentary spirit and because of the lack of training in the field of democracy and the low literacy rate among the masses, democratic institutions cannot flourish in Pakistan&quot;. He believed that the judicial authorities should be given the same powers which they used to enjoy during the British Indian Empire.

Mirza&#x27;s political ideology reflected secularism, and an image of internationalism, strongly advocating religious separation in state matters. Mirza had never had a high opinion of politicians. He was well known for his conviction that the politicians were destroying the country. He felt that in order to work towards real and responsible democracy, the country must have what he called &quot;controlled democracy&quot;.

Historians also asserted that Mirza&#x27;s role as the head of state led him to play an active part in power politics, building an image of being a kingmaker in the country&#x27;s politics. Mirza took full advantage of the weaknesses of politicians and played them against each other, first offsetting the influence of the Muslim League by creating the Republican Party.

During his short span of four years as the head of state, four prime ministers were changed, three of them were his appointees, while the only popularly elected Bengali prime minister was dismissed. Iskander Mirza is thus widely held responsible for the instability that brought the active role of Pakistan armed forces into politics.

By the 1950s, Mirza had moved his personal wealth to Pakistan which was confiscated by the government of Pakistan when he was exiled, and it was reported by &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; in 2016, that his family estate in Murshidabad, West Bengal, was left in ruins.

<text>Bel Paese () or Italico is a semi-soft Italian cheese. It was invented in 1906 by Egidio Galbani who wanted to produce a mild and delicate cheese to sell mainly in Italy. The name Bel Paese comes from the title of a book written by Antonio Stoppani (though the reference is much older, being used by Dante and Petrarch). It is Italian for &quot;beautiful country&quot;, and is used as a phrase for Italy itself.

Originally produced in Melzo, a small town near Milan in the Lombardy region, it is now made in both Italy and the United States. Bel Paese is a cow&#x27;s milk cheese. It matures for six to eight weeks, and has a creamy and light milky aroma. The color is a pale, creamy yellow. It is made in small discs, and is very similar to the French Saint-Paulin cheese and German &quot;Butterkäse&quot;. It has a mild, buttery flavor, and it has been popularly eaten with fruity wines, such as dry red or white. It is favored by many as a snack or dessert cheese and melts easily for use on pizzas or in casseroles. It is often used as a substitute for mozzarella cheese.

Genuine Bel Paese cheese can be determined by the wrapping. It has an image of the Italian geologist and paleontologist Antonio Stoppani, whose geological treatise &quot;Il bel paese&quot; gave its name to Galbani&#x27;s cheese; but while on the wrapping of the cheese made in Italy Stoppani&#x27;s image comes with a map of Italy, cheese made in the United States has a map of America.

<doc id="455038" wikidata="Q20350" url="?curid=455038" title="Moai">
<text>Moai or moʻai ( ; ; ) are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in eastern Polynesia between the years 1250 and 1500. Nearly half are still at Rano Raraku, the main moai quarry, but hundreds were transported from there and set on stone platforms called ahu around the island&#x27;s perimeter. Almost all moai have overly large heads, which account for three-eighths of the size of the whole statue. They also have no legs. The moai are chiefly the living faces (&quot;aringa ora&quot;) of deified ancestors (&quot;aringa ora ata tepuna&quot;).

The statues still gazed inland across their clan lands when Europeans first visited the island in 1722, but all of them had fallen by the latter part of the 19th century. The moai were toppled in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, possibly as a result of European contact or internecine tribal wars.

The production and transportation of the more than 900 statues is considered a remarkable creative and physical feat. The tallest moai erected, called &quot;Paro&quot;, was almost high and weighed . The heaviest moai erected was a shorter but squatter moai at Ahu Tongariki, weighing . One unfinished sculpture, if completed, would be approximately tall, with a weight of about . Statues are still being discovered .

==Description==

The moai are monolithic statues, and their minimalist style reflects forms found throughout Polynesia. Moai are carved from volcanic tuff (solidified ash). The human figures would be outlined in the rock wall first, then chipped away until only the image was left. The over-large heads (a three-to-five ratio between the head and the trunk, a sculptural trait consistent with the Polynesian belief in the sanctity of chiefly the head) have heavy brows and elongated noses with a distinctive fish-hook-shaped curl of the nostrils. The lips protrude in a thin pout. Like the nose, the ears are elongated and oblong in form. The jaw lines stand out against the truncated neck. The torsos are heavy; sometimes the clavicles are subtly outlined in stone too. The arms are carved in bas relief and rest against the body in various positions, hands and long slender fingers resting along the crests of the hips, meeting at the hami (loincloth), with the thumbs sometimes pointing towards the navel. Generally, the anatomical features of the backs are not detailed, but sometimes bear a ring and girdle motif on the buttocks and lower back. Except for one kneeling moai, the statues do not have clearly visible legs.
Though moai are whole-body statues, they are often referred to as &quot;Easter Island heads&quot; in some popular literature. This is partly because of the disproportionate size of most moai heads, and partly because many of the images for the island showing upright moai are of the statues on the slopes of Rano Raraku, many of which are buried to their shoulders, which has led to a popular misconception that they don&#x27;t have bodies. Some of the &quot;heads&quot; at Rano Raraku have been excavated and their bodies seen, and observed to have markings that had been protected from erosion by their burial. 

The average height of the moai is about , with the average width at the base around . These massive creations usually weigh around 12.5 tonnes (13.8 tons) each.

All but 53 of the more than 900 moai known to date were carved from tuff (a compressed volcanic ash) from Rano Raraku, where 394 moai in varying states of completion are still visible today. There are also 13 moai carved from basalt, 22 from trachyte and 17 from fragile red scoria. At the end of carving, the builders would rub the statue with pumice.

===Characteristics===

Easter Island statues are known for their large, broad noses and big chins, along with rectangle-shaped ears and deep eye slits. Their bodies are normally squatting, with their arms resting in different positions and are without legs. The majority of the ahu are found along the coast and face inland towards the community. There are some inland ahu such as Ahu Akivi. These moai face the community but given the small size of the island, also appear to face the coast.

====Eyes====
In 1979, Sergio Rapu Haoa and a team of archaeologists discovered that the hemispherical or deep elliptical eye sockets were designed to hold coral eyes with either black obsidian or red scoria pupils. The discovery was made by collecting and reassembling broken fragments of white coral that were found at the various sites. Subsequently, previously uncategorized finds in the Easter Island museum were re-examined and recategorized as eye fragments. It is thought that the moai with carved eye sockets were probably allocated to the ahu and ceremonial sites, suggesting that a selective Rapa Nui hierarchy was attributed to the moai design until its demise with the advent of the religion revolving around the tangata manu.

===Symbolism===
Many archaeologists suggest that &quot;[the] statues were thus symbols of authority and power, both religious and political. However, they were not only symbols. To the people who erected and used them, they were actual repositories of sacred spirit. Carved stone and wooden objects in ancient Polynesian religions, when properly fashioned and ritually prepared, were believed to be charged by a magical spiritual essence called mana.&quot;

Archaeologists believe that the statues were a representation of the ancient Polynesians&#x27; ancestors. The moai statues face away from the ocean and towards the villages as if to watch over the people. The exception is the seven Ahu Akivi which face out to sea to help travelers find the island. There is a legend that says there were seven men who waited for their king to arrive. A study in 2019 concluded that ancient people believed that quarrying of the moai might be related to improving soil fertility and thereby critical food supplies.

====&quot;Pukao&quot; topknots and headdresses====

The more recent moai had &quot;pukao&quot; on their heads, which represent the topknot of the chieftains. According to local tradition, the mana was preserved in the hair. The pukao were carved out of red scoria, a very light rock from a quarry at Puna Pau. Red itself is considered a sacred color in Polynesia. The added pukao suggest a further status to the moai. 

====Markings====

When first carved, the surface of the moai was polished smooth by rubbing with pumice. However, the easily worked tuff from which most moai were carved is easily eroded, such that the best place to see the surface detail is on the few moai carved from basalt or in photographs and other archaeological records of moai surfaces protected by burials.

Those moai that are less eroded typically have designs carved on their backs and posteriors. The Routledge expedition of 1914 established a cultural link between these designs and the island&#x27;s traditional tattooing, which had been repressed by missionaries a half-century earlier. Until modern DNA analysis of the islanders and their ancestors, this was key scientific evidence that the moai had been carved by the Rapa Nui and not by a separate group from South America.

At least some of the moai were painted. One moai in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art was decorated with a reddish pigment. &quot;Hoa Hakananai&#x27;a&quot; was decorated with maroon and white paint until 1868, when it was removed from the island. It is now housed in the British Museum, London, but demands have been made for its return to Rapa Nui.

==History==

The statues were carved by the aboriginal Polynesians of the island, mostly between 1250 and 1500. In addition to representing deceased ancestors, the moai, once they were erected on ahu, may also have been regarded as the embodiment of powerful living or former chiefs and important lineage status symbols. Each moai presented a status: &quot;The larger the statue placed upon an ahu, the more mana the chief who commissioned it had.&quot; The competition for grandest statue was ever prevalent in the culture of the Easter Islanders. The proof stems from the varying sizes of moai.

Completed statues were moved to ahu mostly on the coast, then erected, sometimes with pukao, red stone cylinders, on their heads. Moai must have been very time-consuming to craft and transport; not only would the actual carving of each statue require effort and resources, but the finished product was then hauled to its final location and erected.
The quarries in Rano Raraku appear to have been abandoned abruptly, with a litter of stone tools and many completed moai outside the quarry awaiting transport and almost as many incomplete statues still &quot;in situ&quot; as were installed on ahu. In the nineteenth century, this led to conjecture that the island was the remnant of a sunken continent and that most completed moai were under the sea. That idea has long been debunked, and now it is generally believed that:
* Some statues were rock carvings and never intended to be completed.
* Some were incomplete because, when inclusions were encountered, the carvers would abandon a partial statue and start a new one. Tuff is a soft rock with occasional lumps of much harder rock included in it.
* Some completed statues at Rano Raraku were placed there permanently and not parked temporarily awaiting removal.
* Some were indeed incomplete when the statue-building era came to an end.

===Craftsmen===
It is not known exactly which group in the communities were responsible for carving statues. Oral traditions suggest that the moai were carved either by a distinguished class of professional carvers who were comparable in status to high-ranking members of other Polynesian craft guilds, or, alternatively, by members of each clan. The oral histories show that the Rano Raraku quarry was subdivided into different territories for each clan.

===Transportation===
Since the island was largely treeless by the time the Europeans first visited, the movement of the statues was a mystery for a long time. Study of fossil pollen and charcoal traces found in sediment cores collected in the island&#x27;s three main crater lakes suggest that forests that originally covered the island were gradually logged between 800 and (as the island was being settled by migrants from eastern Polynesia), then again in the decades or centuries before 1700.

It is not exactly known how the moai were moved across the island, however, there are numerous studies and theories discussing the topic. Earlier researchers assumed that the process required human energy, ropes, and possibly wooden sledges (sleds) or rollers, as well as leveled tracks across the island (the &quot;Easter Island roads&quot;). Another theory suggests that the moai were placed on top of logs and were rolled to their destinations. If that theory is correct, it would take 50–150 people to move the moai. The most recent study demonstrates from the evidence in the archaeological record that the statues were harnessed with ropes from two sides and made to &quot;walk&quot; by tilting them from side to side while pulling forward, in a vertical way.

Oral histories recount how various natives used divine power to command the statues to walk. The earliest accounts say a king named Tuu Ku Ihu moved them with the help of the god Makemake, while later stories tell of a woman who lived alone on the mountain ordering them about at her will. Scholars currently support the theory that the main method was that the moai were &quot;walked&quot; upright (some assume by a rocking process), as laying it prone on a sledge (the method used by the Easter Islanders to move stone in the 1860s) would have required an estimated 1500 people to move the largest moai that had been successfully erected. In 1998, Jo Anne Van Tilburg suggested fewer than half that number could do it by placing the sledge on lubricated rollers. In 1999, she supervised an experiment to move a nine-tonne moai. A replica was loaded on a sledge built in the shape of an &quot;A&quot; frame that was placed on rollers and 60 people pulled on several ropes in two attempts to tow the moai. The first attempt failed when the rollers jammed up. The second attempt succeeded when tracks were embedded in the ground. This was on flat ground and used eucalyptus wood rather than the native palm trees.
In 1986, Pavel Pavel, Thor Heyerdahl and the Kon-Tiki Museum experimented with a five-tonne moai and a nine-tonne moai. With a rope around the head of the statue and another around the base, using eight workers for the smaller statue and 16 for the larger, they &quot;walked&quot; the moai forward by swiveling and rocking it from side to side; however, the experiment was ended early due to damage to the statue bases from chipping. Despite the early end to the experiment, Thor Heyerdahl estimated that this method for a 20-tonne statue over Easter Island terrain would allow per day. Other scholars concluded that it was probably not the way the moai were moved due to the reported damage to the base caused by the &quot;shuffling&quot; motion.

Around the same time, archaeologist Charles Love experimented with a 10-tonne replica. His first experiment found rocking the statue to walk it was too unstable over more than a few hundred yards. He then found that placing the statue upright on two sled runners atop log rollers, 25 men were able to move the statue in two minutes. In 2003, further research indicated this method could explain supposedly regularly spaced post holes (his research on this claim has not yet been published) where the statues were moved over rough ground. He suggested the holes contained upright posts on either side of the path so that as the statue passed between them, they were used as cantilevers for poles to help push the statue up a slope without the requirement of extra people pulling on the ropes and similarly to slow it on the downward slope. The poles could also act as a brake when needed.

Based on detailed studies of the statues found along prehistoric roads, archaeologists Terry Hunt and Carl Lipo have shown that the pattern of breakage, form and position of statues is consistent with an upright hypothesis for transportation. Hunt and Lipo argue that when the statues were carved at a quarry, the sculptors left their bases wide and curved along the front edge. They showed that statues along the road have a center of mass that causes the statue to lean forward. As the statue tilts forward, it rocks sideways along its curved front edge and takes a step. Large flakes are seen broken off the sides of the bases. They argue that once the statue was walked down the road and installed in the landscape, the wide and curved base was carved down.

Terry Hunt of UH Manoa and Carl Lipo of California State University Long Beach have worked closely with Rapa Nui archaeologist Sergio Rapu to develop their theory of how the Rapa Nui people rope walked the moai. It was through their successful moai walking recreation that it was proven that it is fully possible that the moai were literally walked from their quarries to their final positions by ingenious use of ropes. Teams of workers would have worked to rock the moai back and forth, creating the walking motion and holding the moai upright. If correct, it can be inferred that the fallen road moai were the result of the teams of balancers being unable to keep the statue upright, and it was presumably not possible to lift the statues again once knocked over. However, the debate continues.

===Birdman cult===

Originally, Easter Islanders had a paramount chief or single leader. Through the years the power levels veered from sole chiefs to a warrior class known as matatoʻa. The therianthropic figure of a half bird and half-man was the symbol of the matatoʻa; the distinct character connected the sacred site of Orongo. The new cult prompted battles of tribes over worship of ancestry. Creating the moai was one way the islanders would honor their ancestors; during the height of the birdman cult there is evidence which suggests that the construction of moai stopped.

&quot;One of the most fascinating sights at Orongo are the hundreds of petroglyphs carved with birdman and Makemake images. Carved into solid basalt, they have resisted ages of harsh weather. It has been suggested that the images represent birdman competition winners. Over 480 birdman petroglyphs have been found on the island, mostly around Orongo.&quot; Orongo, the site of the cult&#x27;s festivities, was a dangerous landscape which consisted of a &quot;narrow ridge between a drop into the ocean on one side and a deep crater on the other&quot;. Considered the sacred spot of Orongo, Mata Ngarau was the location where birdman priests prayed and chanted for a successful egg hunt. &quot;The purpose of the birdman contest was to obtain the first egg of the season from the offshore islet Motu Nui. Contestants descended the sheer cliffs of Orongo and swam to Motu Nui where they awaited the coming of the birds. Having procured an egg, the contestant swam back and presented it to his sponsor, who then was declared birdman for that year, an important status position.&quot;

===Moai Kavakava===

These figures are much smaller than the better-known stone moai. They are made of wood and have a small, slender aspect, giving them a sad appearance. These figures are believed to have been made after the civilization on Rapa Nui began to collapse, which is why they seem to have a more emaciated appearance to them.

===1722–1868 toppling of the moai===

In years after the arrival in 1722 of Jacob Roggeveen, all of the moai that had been erected on ahu were toppled; some last standing statues were reported in 1838 by Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars, but none remained by 1868, apart from the partially buried ones on the outer slopes of Rano Raraku.

Oral histories include an account of a clan pushing down a single moai in the night, but others tell of the &quot;earth shaking&quot;, and there are indications that at least some of them fell down due to earthquakes. Some of the moai toppled forward such that their faces were hidden, and often fell in such a way that their necks broke; others fell off the back of their platforms. Today, about 50 moai have been re-erected on their ahus or at museums elsewhere.

The Rapa Nui people were devastated by raids of slave traders who visited the island in 1862. Within a year, the individuals who remained on the island were sick or injured, and lacking leadership. The survivors of the slave raids had new company from missionaries, who converted the remaining populace to Christianity. Native Easter Islanders began to be assimilated, as their tattoos and body paint were banned by the new Christian proscriptions, and they were subjected to removal from a portion of their native lands and made to reside on a much smaller portion of the island, while the rest was used for farming by the Peruvians.

===Removal of moai from Easter Island===
Ten or more moai have been removed from Easter Island and transported to locations around the world, including the ones today displayed at the Louvre Museum in Paris and the British Museum in London.

===Replicas and casts===
Several other locations displays replicas (casts) of moai, including the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County; the Auckland Museum; the American Museum of Natural History; and the campus of the American University.

==Preservation and restoration==

From 1955 to 1978, an American archaeologist, William Mulloy, undertook extensive investigation of the production, transportation and erection of Easter Island&#x27;s monumental statuary. Mulloy&#x27;s Rapa Nui projects include the investigation of the Akivi-Vaiteka Complex and the physical restoration of Ahu Akivi (1960); the investigation and restoration of Ahu Ko Te Riku and Ahu Vai Uri and the Tahai Ceremonial Complex (1970); the investigation and restoration of two &quot;ahu&quot; at Hanga Kio&#x27;e (1972); the investigation and restoration of the ceremonial village at Orongo (1974) and numerous other archaeological surveys throughout the island.

The Rapa Nui National Park and the moai were included in the 1972 UN convention concerning the protection of the world&#x27;s cultural and natural heritage and consequently on the 1995 list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The statues have been mapped by a number of groups over the years, including efforts by Father Sebastian Englert and Chilean researchers. The EISP (Easter Island Statue Project) conducted research and documentation on many of the moai on Rapa Nui and the artifacts held in museums overseas. The purpose of the project is to understand the figures original use, context, and meaning, with the results being provided to the Rapa Nui families and the island&#x27;s public agencies that are responsible for conservation and preservation of the moai. Other studies include work by Britton Shepardson,Terry L. Hunt and Carl P. Lipo.

In 2008, a Finnish tourist chipped a piece off the ear of one moai. The tourist was fined $17,000 in damages and was banned from the island for three years.

In 2020, an unoccupied truck rolled into a moai, destroying the statue and causing &#x27;incalculable damage&#x27;.

In 2022, an unknown number of moai in Rano Raraku were damaged by a wildfire that covered an area of around 150 to 250 acres. The Mayor of Rapa Nui, Pedro Edmunds Paoa, stated the fire was started intentionally. Other authorities believe the damage to some of the affected statues is &quot;irreparable&quot;.

==Unicode character==

In 2010, moai was included as a &quot;moyai&quot; emoji (🗿) in Unicode version 6.0 under the code point codice_1 as &quot;Japanese stone statue like Moai on Easter Island&quot;.

The official Unicode name for the emoji is spelt &quot;moyai&quot; as the emoji actually depicts the statue near Shibuya Station in Tokyo. The statue was a gift from the people of Nii-jima (an island from Tokyo but administratively part of the city) inspired by Easter Island moai. The name of the statue was derived by combining &quot;moai&quot; and the dialectal Japanese word .

As the Unicode adopted proprietary emoji initially used by Japanese mobile carriers in the 1990s, inconsistent drawings were adopted for this emoji by various companies with proprietary emoji images, depicting either a moai or the statue. The Google and Microsoft emoji initially resembled the statue in Tokyo; however, the emoji were later revised to resemble moai.

Notwithstanding its intended purpose, the emoji is commonly used in Internet culture as a meme to represent a deadpan expression or used to convey that something is being said in a particularly sarcastic fashion.

<text>Marion King Hubbert (October 5, 1903 – October 11, 1989) was an American geologist and geophysicist. He worked at the Shell research lab in Houston, Texas. He made several important contributions to geology, geophysics, and petroleum geology, most notably the Hubbert curve and Hubbert peak theory (a basic component of peak oil), with important political ramifications. He was often referred to as &quot;M. King Hubbert&quot; or &quot;King Hubbert&quot;.

==Biography==
Hubbert was born in San Saba, Texas. He attended the University of Chicago, where he received a Bachelor of Science in 1926, a Master of Science in 1928, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1937, studying geology, mathematics, and physics. He worked as an assistant geologist for the Amerada Petroleum Company for two years while pursuing the PhD, additionally teaching geophysics at Columbia University. He also served as a senior analyst at the Board of Economic Warfare. He joined the Shell Oil Company in 1943, retiring from that firm in 1964. After he retired from Shell, he became a senior research geophysicist for the United States Geological Survey until his retirement in 1976. He also held positions as a professor of geology and geophysics at Stanford University from 1963 to 1968, and as a professor at UC Berkeley from 1973 to 1976.

Hubbert was an avid technocrat. He co-founded Technocracy Incorporated with Howard Scott. Hubbert wrote a study course that was published without attribution called the Technocracy Study Course, which advocates a non-market economics form of energy accounting, in contrast to the current price system method.

Hubbert was a member of the board of governors, and served as secretary of education in that organization. Hubert died on October 11, 1989, at the age of 86 while receiving treatment for pulmonary embolism.

==Research==
Hubbert made several contributions to geophysics, including a mathematical demonstration that rock in the Earth&#x27;s crust, because it is under immense pressure in large areas, should exhibit plasticity, similar to clay. This demonstration explained the observed results that the Earth&#x27;s crust deforms over time. He also studied the flow of underground fluids.

Based on theoretical arguments, Hubbert (1940) proposed a constitutive equation formula_1 for absolute permeability formula_2 of an underground water or oil reservoir where formula_3 is the average grain diameter and formula_4 is a dimensionless proportionality constant. However, Kozeny (1927) proposed a constitutive equation for absolute permeability which contains Hubbert&#x27;s proposal as a factor. Hubbert (1940, 1956) also presented a force potential, denoted formula_5 or formula_6, that bears his name:

:formula_7

Some years later Hubbert (1956) showed that Darcy&#x27;s law can be derived from the Navier–Stokes equation of motion of a viscous fluid.

Hubbert is best known for his studies on the size of oil fields and natural gas reserves, and the limits these impose on rates of oil and gas production. He predicted that for any oil-producing area, whether a province, a nation, or the planet as a whole, the rate of petroleum production of the reserve over time would resemble a bell curve. Based on his theory, he presented a paper to the 1956 meeting of the American Petroleum Institute in San Antonio, Texas, which predicted that overall petroleum production would peak in the United States between 1965, which he considered most likely, and 1970, which he considered an upper bound. At first his prediction received much criticism, for the most part because many other predictions of oil capacity had been made over the preceding half century, but these had usually been based on the reserves-to-production ratio, had not taken into account future discoveries, and had proven false. Hubbert became famous when U.S. oil production peaked in 1970 and began to decline, as he had predicted.

In 1974, Hubbert projected that global oil production would peak in 1995 &quot;if current trends continue&quot;. Various subsequent predictions have been made by others as trends have fluctuated in the intervening years.

Hubbert believed that solar power would be a practical renewable energy replacement for fossil fuels, and that nuclear energy in breeder reactors would be able to sustain humanity for centuries. He also states that &quot;provided world population can somehow be brought under control, we may at last have found an energy supply (uranium) adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the &#x27;foreseeable future&#x27;.&quot;

===Contributions===
Hubbert&#x27;s contributions to science have been summarized as follows:
* Mathematical demonstration that rock in the Earth&#x27;s crust is plastic, and that the Earth&#x27;s crust deforms over time.
* Prediction of migration paths of hydrocarbons.
* Predictions of peak rates of oil and gas mining, based on a consistent mathematical model which ties reserves, discovery rates, and production rates. His model remains highly influential, and has been widely applied to other finite resources.

===Renewable resources===
*Fisheries: At least one researcher has attempted to perform Hubbert linearization (Hubbert curve) on the whaling industry, as well as charting the transparently dependent price of caviar on sturgeon depletion. The Atlantic northwest cod fishery was a renewable resource, but the numbers of fish taken exceeded the fish&#x27;s rate of recovery. The end of the cod fishery matches the exponential drop of the Hubbert bell curve. The comparison of the cases of fisheries and of mineral extraction shows that the human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a depletion cycle which mirrors the Hubbert curve.

==Accolades==
Hubbert was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was long affiliated with the Geological Society of America, receiving their Arthur L. Day Medal in 1954, being elected President of the Society in 1962, and receiving the Society&#x27;s Penrose Medal in 1973. He received the Vetlesen Prize from the G. Unger Vetlesen Foundation and Columbia University in 1981. He also received the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1981.

<text>Fazal Elahi Chaudhry (; 1 January 19042 June 1982) was a Pakistani politician who served as the fifth president of Pakistan from 1973 to 1978 prior to the imposition of martial law led by Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq. He also served as the deputy speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 1965 to 1969 and the eighth speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 1972 to 1973.

==Early life==
Fazal Elahi Chaudhry was born on 1 January 1904 into an influential Punjabi family in Marala village, near the city of Kharian, Gujrat District in Punjab Province. After receiving his education from there, Chaudhry joined the prestigious Aligarh Muslim University in 1920, receiving his LLB in Civil law in 1924. Thereafter, Chaudhry returned to Punjab and attended the Punjab University&#x27;s post-graduate school in law and political science. In 1925, Chaudhry obtained his MA in Political Science in 1925, and the advanced LLM in Law and Justice, in 1927.

After completing his education, Chaudhry established his law firm in Lahore, advocating for civil liberties, and went back to Gujrat and started practising the civil law.

==Political career==

=== Early years (1942-1956) ===
In 1930, Chaudhry started taking interest in politics and participated in the 1930 Indian general election for the Gujrat District Board and was elected unopposed. He joined the Muslim League in 1942. In 1945, he was elected from Gujrat as the President of Muslim League. He took part in the 1946 Indian provincial elections on Muslim League&#x27;s ticket and played an important role in propagating the ideas of the Muslim League among the people of his area. Upon the independence of Pakistan, he was given the post of Parliamentary Secretary, and was included in Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s cabinet, serving as the education and health minister.

He further joined Pakistan permanent representative&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations in 1951. In 1951, he contested the elections of the Punjab Legislative Assembly on the Muslim League ticket and was elected as a member of the Punjab Assembly. In 1952, he represented Pakistan in the United Nations.

=== Speaker and deputy speaker roles (1956-1972) ===
In the 1956 elections, he was elected as member of the West Pakistan Assembly. Chaudhry served as the first Speaker of the West Pakistan Legislative Assembly from 20 May 1956 to 7 October 1958. In 1962, when Ayub Khan announced the elections, he was selected as the Deputy Opposition Leader of the House on the basis of his experience and knowledge about parliamentary proceedings. Chaudhry joined the Convention Muslim League, and after the 1965 presidential election, he was elected as the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, a role he served in till 1969.

He was elected as member of the National Assembly in 1970 on the ticket of the Pakistan Peoples Party, and was later elected as the Speaker of the National Assembly in 1972. He ended up joining the Pakistan Peoples Party.

=== President of Pakistan (1973-1978) ===
He contested the Presidential Elections of 1973 against Khan Amirzadah Khan of NAP and all opposition parties, and was elected president in 1973 (receiving 139 votes against Khan&#x27;s 45), when the head of the PPP, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was made Prime Minister. He was the first Punjabi President of Pakistan.

Chaudhry was largely a figurehead, and was the first Pakistani President with less power than the Prime Minister. This was due to the new constitution of 1973 that gave more powers to the Prime Minister. Previously, the President had been the chief executive of Pakistan and had the power to appoint Prime Minister. After Operation Fair Play - a codename of the operation to remove Zulfikar Ali Bhutto from power - Chaudhry continued his presidency but had no influence in the government operations or the military and national affairs.

After contentious relations with the military, Chaudhry decided to resign from his post despite the urging of the Chief of Army Staff and Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. On 16 September 1978, Chaudhry handed the charge of the presidency to ruling military general Zia-ul-Haq who succeeded him as the sixth president, in addition to being the Chief Martial Law Administrator and the Chief of Army Staff.He presented Pakistan as an Islamic country in the world.

==Death==
Chaudhry died of a heart ailment on 2 June 1982 at the age of 78.

<text>Defence Intelligence (DI) is an organisation within the United Kingdom intelligence community which focuses on gathering and analysing military intelligence. It differs from the UK&#x27;s intelligence agencies (MI6, GCHQ and MI5) in that it is an integral part of a government department – the Ministry of Defence (MoD) – rather than a stand-alone organisation. The organisation employs a mixture of civilian and military staff and is funded within the UK&#x27;s defence budget. The organisation was formerly known as the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), but changed its name in 2009.

The primary role of Defence Intelligence is that of &#x27;all-source&#x27; intelligence analysis. This discipline draws information from a variety of overt and covert sources to provide the intelligence needed to support military operations, contingency planning, and to inform defence policy and procurement decisions. The maintenance of the ability to give timely strategic warning of politico-military and scientific and technical developments with the potential to affect UK interests is a vital part of the process. 

DI&#x27;s assessments are used outside the MoD to support the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and to assist the work of other Government departments (OGDs) and international partners (such as NATO and the European Union). It is this &#x27;all-source&#x27; function which distinguishes Defence Intelligence from other organisations such as SIS and GCHQ which focus on the collection of &#x27;single-source&#x27; Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) respectively. As such Defence Intelligence occupies a unique position within the UK intelligence community.

The organisation is headed by the Chief of Defence Intelligence, currently Adrian Bird who replaced General James Hockenhull after his appointment as Commander, Strategic Command.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Defence Intelligence can trace its history back to 1873 with the formation of the Intelligence Branch of the British War Office, which, in 1888, became the Directorate of Military Intelligence. The Committee of Imperial Defence, established in 1902, had the task of co-ordinating the different armed services on issues of military strategy intelligence assessments and estimates.

=== Military Intelligence ===
During World War I (1914–1918), &quot;Military Intelligence&quot; (MI) departments, such as MI1 for the secretariat of the Director of Military Intelligence (now GCHQ), were responsible for various intelligence gathering functions. Many of the original MI departments, such as MI4 (Aerial Photography) were renamed or eventually subsumed into Defence Intelligence.

=== Joint Intelligence Bureau ===
Shortly after the 1945 end of the Second World War, the topographical department of the War Office was transformed into the Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB), and its director, Sir Kenneth Strong, became a full member of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) in January 1947. The JIB was structured into a series of divisions: procurement (JIB 1), geographic (JIB 2 and JIB 3), defences, ports and beaches (JIB 4), airfields (JIB 5), key points (JIB 6), oil (JIB 7) and telecommunications (JIB 8).

=== Defence Intelligence Staff ===
When the Ministry of Defence (MOD) was formed in 1964, Naval Intelligence, Military Intelligence and Air Intelligence combined to form the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS). Although the DIS focussed initially on Cold War issues, more recently its attention has moved to support for overseas operations, to weapons of mass destruction and to international counter-terrorism activities.

In an effort to demonstrate justification for British participation in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Operation TELIC, use was made of intelligence material and product to compile a dossier released into the public domain by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. The dossier was compiled by the JIC and published in September 2002 to support the case for invasion. Shortly after the dossier was published, Parliament ratified the government&#x27;s decision to go to war.
A number of weapon specialist staff in the DIAS expressed concern about the wording related to the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the corresponding threat to the UK. Dr Brian Jones, head of the counter-proliferation analysis branch with others complained in writing to the then DCDI (Tony Cragg) that the wording of the dossier was too strong. A particular source of criticism was a claim that Iraq &quot;could&quot; launch chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so, should have been hedged with caveats. These concerns were overruled by the then CDI, Air Marshal Sir Joe French. 

Another eminent weapons expert who worked closely with the DIS, Dr David Kelly, following off-the-record briefings to journalists about his criticisms of the &quot;45 minute&quot; claim, describing it as risible, were broadcast on the BBCs &quot;Today&quot; by Andrew Gilligan. The resulting controversy and release of Kelly&#x27;s name as the source of the report led to his suicide.

The subsequent inquiry, chaired by Lord Hutton, the Hutton Inquiry, into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr Kelly resulted in the discussion of these issues in public. It was revealed that the 45 minutes claim was based on &quot;compartmentalized&quot; intelligence which had not been exposed to Dr Jones branch. Jones has subsequently said that it was unlikely that should anyone with WMD expertise had seen the &quot;compartmentalized&quot; report prior to its inclusion in the dossier they would have supported its credibility.
Chemical and biological munitions were never deployed during the war, and no evidence of WMD was found. It was succeeded by the Butler Review.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Defence Intelligence has regularly released intelligence information, including information on the course of the war. The Russian government accuses the UK Government of a targeted disinformation campaign. Intelligence information released has included details of anticipated Russian troop movements. Since June 2021, Defence Intelligence has also been reporting on the latest Ukraine offensive.

In 2012 the Joint Forces Intelligence Group (JFIG) was established under the new Joint Forces Command and superseded the Intelligence Collection Group (ICG). Making up the largest sub-element of Defence Intelligence, JFIG was made responsible for the collection of signals, geospatial, imagery and measurement and signature intelligence and comprised:
* The National Centre for Geospatial Intelligence (NCGI), formerly known as the Defence Geospatial Intelligence Fusion Centre (DGIFC) and prior to that JARIC (Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre)
* The Defence Geographic Centre (DGC)
* Joint Services Signals Organisation (JSSO)
* Defence HUMINT Unit (DHU)
The National Centre for Geospatial Intelligence (NCGI) was based at RAF Wyton in Cambridgeshire (since moving from RAF Brampton in 2013) and provides specialist imagery intelligence to the armed forces and other UK government customers. They deliver this through the exploitation of satellite imaging systems, as well as airborne and ground-based collection systems. NCGI uses these sources, together with advanced technologies, to provide regional intelligence assessments and support to strategic intelligence projections.
The Defence HUMINT Organisation (DHO) is a Tri-Service organisation that provides specialist support to military operations. The DHO manages strategic aspects of defence human intelligence and is under the command of a Colonel. It draws staff from across the three services.
The Joint Services Signals Organisation (JSSO) collects signals intelligence. The JSSO is based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire under the command of a Group Captain with some 1,600 staff drawn from all three services. One of its components is JSSO (Cyprus) which runs electronic intelligence gathering activities at Ayios Nikolaos Station in Cyprus.
In 2013, JFIG HQ moved from Feltham in Middlesex to RAF Wyton.

In 2024 the JFIG as a body was reportedly disbanded. How its subordinate 
organisations were reallocated is not clear. 

==Organisation==
Defence Intelligence is headed by the Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) who is either a serving three-star military officer or a Senior Civil Servant and who, as the MOD&#x27;s &#x27;intelligence process owner&#x27;, is also responsible for the overall co-ordination of intelligence activities throughout the Armed Forces and single Service Commands. He is supported by two deputies—one civilian and one military. The civilian Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence (DCDI) is responsible for Defence Intelligence analysis and production and the military Director of Cyber Intelligence and Information Integration (DCI3) is responsible for intelligence collection and capability.

===Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence (DCDI)===
DCDI manages the intelligence analysis and production directorates of Defence Intelligence. These include directorates for:
* Strategic Assessments (regional and thematic)
* Capability Assessments (weapons systems and platforms)
* Counter Proliferation
* Counter Intelligence

DCDI is responsible for intelligence analysis and production, providing global defence intelligence assessments and strategic warning on a wide range of issues including, intelligence support for operations; proliferation and arms control; conventional military capabilities; strategic warning and technical evaluations of weapons systems. These intelligence assessments draw upon classified information provided by GCHQ, SIS, the Security Service, Allied intelligence services and military collection assets, in addition to diplomatic reporting and a wide range of publicly available or ‘open source’ information such as media reporting and the internet.

===Director of Cyber Intelligence and Information Integration (DCI3)===
DCI3 is responsible for the provision of specialised intelligence, imagery and geographic support services, and for the intelligence and security training of the Armed Forces. In addition to a Head Office policy staff he is responsible for several major groupings within Defence Intelligence.

===Joint Intelligence Training Group (JITG)===
The Joint Intelligence Training Group (JITG), at MOD Chicksands, Bedfordshire, is the focal point for defence intelligence, security, languages and photography training in the UK, though photography training is carried out at the Defence School of Photography (DSoP) at RAF Cosford. The organisation consists of a headquarters, the Defence College of Intelligence and a specialist operational intelligence capability. JITG is co-located with the headquarters of the British Army&#x27;s Intelligence Corps.

==Defence intelligence roles==
To support its mission, Defence Intelligence has four essential roles:

Support to operations: DI plays an integral part in the planning process throughout all stages of military operations, by providing intelligence collection and analysis at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Examples of the support DI has provided to operations are:
* Coalition action in Iraq
* NATO led forces in Afghanistan and Bosnia
* UN humanitarian and peace-support operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cyprus, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo
DI has deployed intelligence analysts, linguists and reservists overseas, and provide geographic support by supplying both standard and specialised mapping to overseas theatres.

Support to contingency planning for operations: DI provides intelligence data and all source assessments that assist in preparations for future situations with the potential to require the commitment of UK Armed Forces. These products, which cover political and military developments, country and cultural information, critical infrastructure and internal security, all aid contingency planning.

Provision of early warning: A fundamental responsibility of Defence Intelligence is to alert ministers, chiefs of staff, senior officials and defence planners to impending crises around the world. Such warning is vital for short and medium term planning. DI meets this responsibility by focusing on current areas and topics of concern, highlighting the effects of changing circumstances, predicting security and stability trends, and assessing how these trends may develop. The assessments are distributed to decision-makers throughout the MOD, the Armed Forces, other government departments, allies, and UK Embassies and High Commissions.

Provision of longer-term analysis of emerging threats: Defence Intelligence provides longer-term assessments of likely scenarios around the world where UK Armed Forces might need to operate and of the equipment that they might face. It also provides technical support to the development of future military equipment and to the development of countermeasures against potentially hostile systems.

==Early life and education==

Allison Brooks Janney was born on November 19, 1959, in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She is the daughter of Macy Brooks Janney (née Putnam), a former actress, and Jervis Spencer Janney Jr., a real estate developer and jazz musician. She has an older brother, Jay, and had a younger brother, Hal (1961–2011). Hal, who had battled depression and addiction for many years, committed suicide in 2011 at the age of 49.

Janney is a descendant of Stephen Hopkins through this daughter Constance Hopkins both of whom came to the New World on the Mayflower, as she recounted on a 2022 episode of Who Do You Think You Are?. 

She attended the Miami Valley School in Dayton, where she was named a distinguished alumna in 2005, and the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, where she was named Alumna of the Year in 2016. Janney initially aspired to a career in figure skating, but her height of 6 ft (183cm) and a freak accident when she was a teenager put an end to that dream.

She attended Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where she majored in theatre. During her freshman year, Janney met actors Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward at a play for the inaugural event of the college&#x27;s newly built Bolton Theater, which Newman was directing. The couple encouraged her to continue acting and offered her guidance during the early days in her career. She went on to train at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York and then received a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in mid-1984.

==Career==

Janney&#x27;s first role on television was in the short-lived black-and-white faux-1940s comedy &quot;Morton &amp; Hayes&quot;. She moved on to soap operas; she played the short-term role of Vi Kaminski on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, and then played the recurring role of Ginger, one of the Spaulding maids, on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; for nearly two years. In the spring of 1994, she appeared in the season-four finale of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, titled &quot;Old Friends&quot;, as a reluctant witness against a member of the Russian mob. She was also a cast member on the radio show &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;. Janney made her professional stage debut in 1989 with an uncredited part in the Off-Broadway production &quot;Ladies&quot;. Following minor roles in similar productions like; &quot;Prescribed Laughter In The Emergency Café&quot;, &quot;Five Women Wearing the Same Dress&quot; and &quot;Blue Window&quot;.

Janney made her Broadway debut with the 1996 revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Present Laughter&quot;. She played Liz Essendine, the estranged wife of the lead character (played by Frank Langella). Although a minor role, her performance garnered praise and attention with &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;The most fully accomplished performance on the stage&quot;. For her performance in the play, Janney won the Theatre World Award, Clarence Derwent Award for Most Promising Female, Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play and received a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play. Janney made her film debut with a minor part in &quot;Who Shot Pat?&quot; (1989). This was followed by a series of minor roles in numerous films throughout the 1990s, including; &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994), &quot;Big Night&quot; (1996), &quot;Private Parts&quot; (1997), &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; (1997), &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; (1998), &quot;The Impostors&quot; (1998), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; (1999), &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; (1999), and &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999).

Janney starred in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s 1998 revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; to positive reviews. Janney starred opposite Anthony LaPaglia, Stephen Spinella, and Brittany Murphy. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Janney writing, &quot;Allison Janney is splendid as Beatrice, a loving, patient woman of backbone who looks on helplessly but not quietly as her husband heads into the darkness&quot;. Charles Isherwood of &quot;Variety&quot; agreed describing her performance as &quot;affecting&quot;. For her performance, Janney won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play, Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play, and received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

=== 1999–2006: &quot;The West Wing&quot; and acclaim ===

After a decade of small and uncredited parts, Janney had her breakthrough when she was cast as White House Press Secretary C. J. Cregg in the NBC political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. Creator Aaron Sorkin called Janney to audition for the role after seeing her in the film &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. Loosely based on Dee Dee Myers, the press secretary during Clinton administration, C. J. is a National Merit Scholar who ultimately succeeds Leo McGarry as White House Chief of Staff. Writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, John Reid says that &quot;her capability and combination of strength and simple compassion represented the fantasy of the Bartlet White House better than anyone.&quot; The publication also ranks her as the best character from the series. In their ranking of the best characters from all the television series created by Sorkin, &quot;Vulture&quot;, ranks C. J. at No. 2 and says; &quot;If all the Sorkin women were as classy, self-assured, and legitimately funny (the turkey pardon!) as C. J., we&#x27;d never have had the Sorkin woman argument in the first place&quot;. For her portrayal of C. J. Cregg, Janney won four Primetime Emmy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Award, a Satellite Award and four nominations for the Golden Globe Awards, making her the most awarded cast member of the series. For the last of these she won the Screen Actors Guild Award and Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Acting Ensemble.

Following few short-lived shows and a brief sabbatical from television, Janney returned to the small screen with the CBS sitcom &quot;Mom&quot;, which ran from 2013 until 2021. Janney played Bonnie Plunkett, a self-centered, cynical recovering addict who tries to regain the love and trust of her daughter (played by Anna Faris).

Janney received nominations for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play, Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance and won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play.

In 2017, Janney starred in Craig Gillespie&#x27;s black comedy &quot;I, Tonya&quot;, based on the life of figure skater Tonya Harding.

Janney&#x27;s performance received widespread acclaim with Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writing: &#x27;Janney steals every scene she&#x27;s in, playing LaVona, a harridan whose nodding goes beyond tough love.&#x27; She earned numerous accolades for her performance in the film including the Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award, Independent Spirit Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In 2024, Janney began portraying Evelyn Rollins, a socialite in the 1950s in Apple TV+&#x27;s period comedy series &quot;Palm Royale&quot;. The same year she guest starred in the final season of the sitcom &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. In 2024, Janney began starring in Netflix&#x27;s political drama &quot;The Diplomat&quot; as Vice President of the United States Grace Penn. Her first foray into the genre since &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Janney&#x27;s performance garnered critical acclaim and nominations at the Critics Choice Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranking her performance amongst &quot;The 10 Best TV Performances of 2024&quot;.
Janney is currently in production with two films: &quot;A Simple Favor 2&quot; and &quot;Everything&#x27;s Going to Be Great&quot;.

==Personal life==
Janney has never been married and has no children, of which she said: &quot;I&#x27;ve never had that instinct to have kids, I&#x27;m at peace with it&quot;. She was romantically involved with computer programmer Dennis Gagomiros. The couple began dating in 1994, and were interested in getting married but ended their relationship after seven years together in 2001. In 2002, she met actor Richard Jenik (her co-star in &quot;Our Very Own&quot;). The couple got engaged in 2004 but broke up two years later in 2006. In 2012, Janney met production manager Philip Joncas. The two met on the set of &quot;The Way, Way Back&quot; and began dating soon after. The couple dated for five years before ending their relationship in 2017.

In interviews related to her role on &quot;Mom,&quot; Janney discussed her brother, Hal, who fought drug addiction for years before his suicide. She has credited playing her character on &quot;Mom&quot; to people fighting addiction. On March 4, 2018, Janney dedicated her Academy Award win to him during her acceptance speech.

In 2004, she began lending her voice to television and radio spots created by Kaiser Permanente in the health maintenance organization&#x27;s broad &quot;Thrive&quot; media campaign, and in a radio campaign for the American Institute of Architects. In September 2010, it was announced that Janney would be the voice of the Aly San San spokesdroid in the Disney attraction Star Tours – The Adventures Continue. The attraction later opened at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and Disneyland. In October 2016, Janney became the first woman to receive the Alumni Award of The Hotchkiss School and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her work in the entertainment industry, located at 6100 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Activism==
Janney has campaigned for numerous issues like women&#x27;s rights, LGBTQ rights, mental health, animal rights, and addiction recovery. In 2018, Janney participated in the 2018 Women&#x27;s March in Los Angeles, part of a larger national movement for women&#x27;s rights, human rights, and social justice. She supports various charities including American Heart Association, American Stroke Association, Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, and GLAAD.

In 2016, Janney was honored at the White House at the event &quot;Champions of Change&quot;, which honored 10 accomplished individuals from across the country who were being recognized for advancing addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery. She also participated in a panel discussion with Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to talk about the portrayal of addiction and recovery in the media. In 2017, Janney donated $250,000 to Planned Parenthood. In 2020 with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, Janney donated $10,000 to the Dayton Foodbank, an organization providing food to the homeless.

Janney has also been an active supporter of voter registration, posting about voter ID issues and suggesting fans check VoteRiders for details. She and her &quot;West Wing&quot; co-stars were part of Michelle Obama&#x27;s When We All Vote initiative. More recently, she participated in &quot;Divas for Democracy: United We Slay&quot;, a streaming variety show supporting voter registration.

<doc id="455048" wikidata="Q7097470" url="?curid=455048" title="Operation Rockingham">
<text>Operation Rockingham was the codeword for UK involvement in inspections in Iraq following the war over Kuwait in 1990–91. Early in 1991 the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) was established to oversee the destruction of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. Use of the codeword was referred to in the annual British defence policy white paper &quot;Statement on the Defence Estimates 1991&quot; (published in July that year as Command Paper 1559-I) where at page 28 it states &quot;The United Kingdom is playing a full part in the work of the Special Commission; our involvement is known as Operation ROCKINGHAM.&quot; The activities carried out by the UK as part of Rockingham were detailed in the following white paper (published in July 1992 as Command Paper 1981).

The codename languished in obscurity for a decade or so, used only by those in support of inspections in Iraq. Each department of the UK government directly involved in these support activities would have its staff allocated to &quot;Rockingham&quot; duties. In the Defence Intelligence Staff, the team involved with Iraq activities was known as the &quot;Rockingham Cell&quot;. The codename hit the headlines after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, over allegations that Operation Rockingham was a propaganda effort within the British intelligence world.

==The Rockingham Allegations==
Former US military intelligence officer and UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter claimed that Operation Rockingham was a secret UK intelligence unit in an interview with the Scottish Sunday Herald in June 2003. Journalist Neil Mackay described the function of Operation Rockingham, in Ritter&#x27;s words, as &quot;producing misleading intelligence on Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction, which could be used as justification for action against Iraq&quot;. The article claimed, based on Ritter&#x27;s allegations, that the Rockingham cell was at the center of various British and US intelligence organisations collecting information on Iraq&#x27;s WMD, and that the unit dealt with intelligence obtained from a variety of sources, including Iraqi defectors and the UN arms inspections organisation in Iraq UNSCOM, which Rockingham had penetrated. According to Scott Ritter the unit amassed evidence selectively, with government backing, for political goals:

&quot;Operation Rockingham cherry-picked intelligence. It received hard data, but had a preordained outcome in mind. It only put forward a small percentage of the facts when most were ambiguous or noted no WMD... It became part of an effort to maintain a public mindset that Iraq was not in compliance with the inspections. They had to sustain the allegation that Iraq had WMD [when] Unscom was showing the opposite.&quot;

For example, Ritter claimed, Rockingham would leak false information to weapons inspectors but then use the inspections as evidence for WMD: &quot;Rockingham was the source of some very controversial information which led to inspections of a suspected ballistic missile site. We ... found nothing. However, our act of searching allowed the US and UK to say that the missiles existed.&quot;

Ritter alleged that &quot;Operation Rockingham&quot; assumed a central role within the UK intelligence system in building the case that Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction capabilities constituted a threat to the UK and the US.

Ritter said that the Rockingham cell included military officers, intelligence services representatives as well as civilian Ministry of Defence personnel. According to Ritter, the British weapons expert David Kelly, played an important role in Operation Rockingham. Ritter describes him as &quot;Rockingham&#x27;s go-to person for translating the data that came out of Unscom into concise reporting&quot;.

The day before he died, Kelly had told the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) : &quot;Within the defence intelligence services I liaise with the Rockingham cell.&quot; Although this evidence was given in secret, a transcript was released to the Hutton Inquiry. 

The press jumped on a suggestion that the only other public mention of &quot;Operation Rockingham&quot; prior to David Kelly&#x27;s ISC evidence was by Brigadier Richard Holmes while giving evidence to the defence select committee in June 1998. This clearly overlooked the public references to Rockingham that had been made in 1991 and 1992.

==The Counter Claims==
John Morrison, the founder and manager of the DIS Rockingham cell, comprehensively denied Ritter&#x27;s allegations as wholly unfounded. In a letter to the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper he stated:

&quot;Rockingham was a tiny cell which drew on and coordinated all the resources of the DIS; its only aim was to provide leads for Unscom teams, which it did very successfully despite the problems of sanitising sensitive intelligence. Inevitably it was most effective in its earliest years, when Iraq&#x27;s main WMD facilities, nuclear programme and stocks of chemical and biological weapons were destroyed.&quot;

After the evidence to the Hutton Inquiry had been published it became clear that senior experts in the DIS assessment staff, including Dr Brian Jones, were unhappy about the wording in the dossier concerning the threat to the UK posed by Iraq&#x27;s Weapons of Mass Destruction.

Jones and others had complained in writing to the then Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence (Tony Cragg) that the wording of the dossier was too strong. For instance, they felt claims that Iraq &quot;could&quot; launch Chemical or Biological Weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so should have had caveats attached. Their complaints were overruled by the then Chief of Defence Intelligence Air Marshal Sir Joe French.

It was claimed at the Hutton Inquiry that the 45 minutes claim was based on &quot;compartmentalized&quot; intelligence from MI6 which the Joint Intelligence Committee had seen but that the weapons experts in DIS had not. Writing in the Independent on 4 February 2004, Dr Jones said that it was unlikely that anyone with WMD expertise had seen the &quot;compartmentalized&quot; report prior to its inclusion in the dossier, and if they had, they would have been sceptical.

Contrary to the Ritter allegations that the Rockingham cell DIS &quot;cherry-picked intelligence&quot;, the DIS staff had been some of the most sceptical voices with regard to intelligence on Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction capabilities. After his time in the DIS, John Morrison worked for the ISC as its investigator until he was sacked for saying in a BBC interview that when the Prime Minister asserted that the threat from Iraq&#x27;s WMD &quot;is current and serious&quot; that he &quot;could almost hear the collective raspberry going up around Whitehall&quot;.

The report published by the Butler Review in July 2004 dedicated a page to Operation Rockingham (p. 104). It countered Ritter&#x27;s claims by stating authoritatively that after its creation in 1991 within the DIS, &quot;Rockingham was responsible for briefing some of the personnel who formed part of UNSCOM and International Atomic Energy Agency inspection teams. It processed information received as a result of the inspections, and acted as a central source of advice on continuing inspection activity. Rockingham also advised FCO and MOD policy branches on the provision of UK experts from government and industry to work with UNSCOM and the IAEA as members of inspection teams. Rockingham included an officer detached to Bahrain to staff an organisation known as GATEWAY to co-ordinate briefings to, and debriefings of, inspection team members as they deployed to, and returned from, Iraq.&quot; After being reduced to one member of staff in 1998, it was again expanded to &quot;provide UK support to UNMOVIC&quot;.

&quot;No official feedback from UNMOVIC was offered, nor expected. Rockingham did not brief or debrief individual inspectors. It did, however, continue to provide UNMOVIC and the IAEA with all-source UK intelligence assessments of the extent of Iraq&#x27;s nuclear, biological, chemical and ballistic missile programmes, and information about sites of potential significance. It acted as the focus for the work tasked by the JIC on the analysis of the Iraqi declaration of 7 December 2002&quot; (that is, the 12,000-page weapons declaration handed over by Iraq as required by UN resolution).

<text>Zhao Shangzhi (; 26 October 1908 –12 February 1942) was a Chinese military commander. Born into a peasant-turned-intellectual family in Chaoyang, Liaoning, he participated in the May Thirtieth Movement in 1925, and joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the same year. In November 1925, he went to study in the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou.

After 18 September 1932 he took the charge of the CCP Northeast military division. In October 1933, he was in charge of Zhuhe anti-Japan guerrillas, and was promoted to commander of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army in 1934.

On 12 February 1942, he was captured by Japanese military police after being attacked by an agent provocateur, and died later at the age of 34.

The city of Zhuhe, where he fought against the Japanese, was renamed in 1946 to Shangzhi in his memory.

<text>A transaction account (also called a checking account, cheque account, chequing account, current account, [[demand deposit]] account, or share account at credit unions) is a deposit account or bank account held at a bank or other financial institution. It is available to the account owner &quot;on demand&quot; and is available for frequent and immediate access by the account owner or to others as the account owner may direct. Access may be in a variety of ways, such as cash withdrawals, use of debit cards, cheques and electronic transfer. In economic terms, the funds held in a transaction account are regarded as liquid funds. In accounting terms, they are considered as cash.

Transaction accounts are known by a variety of descriptions, including a current account (British English), chequing account or checking account when held by a bank, share draft account when held by a credit union in North America. In the Commonwealth of Nations, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa and a number of other countries they are commonly called current or, before the demise of cheques, cheque accounts. Because money is available on demand they are also sometimes known as demand accounts or demand deposit accounts. In the United States, NOW accounts operate as transaction accounts.

Transaction accounts are operated by both businesses and personal users. Depending on the country and local demand economics earning from interest rates varies. Again depending on the country the financial institution that maintains the account may charge the account holder maintenance or transaction fees or offer the service free to the holder and charge only if the holder uses an add-on service such as an overdraft.

== History ==

In Holland in the early 1500s, Amsterdam was a major trading and shipping city. People who had acquired large accumulations of cash began to deposit their money with &quot;cashiers&quot; to protect their wealth. These cashiers held the money for a fee. Competition drove cashiers to offer additional services, including paying out money to any person bearing a written order from a depositor to do so. They kept the note as proof of payment.

This concept spread to other countries including England and its colonies in North America, where land owners in Boston in 1681 mortgaged their land to cashiers who provided an account against which they could write checks.

In the 18th century in England, preprinted checks, serial numbers, and the word &quot;cheque&quot; appeared. By the late 18th century, the difficulty of clearing checks (sending them from one bank to another for collection) gave rise to the development of clearing houses.

== Features and access ==

All transaction accounts offer itemised lists of all financial transactions, either through a bank statement or a passbook. A transaction account allows the account holder to make or receive payments by:

* ATM cards (withdraw cash at any Automated Teller Machine)
* Debit card (cashless direct payment at a store or merchant)
* Cash (deposit and withdrawal of coins and banknotes at a branch)
* Cheque and money order (paper instruction to pay)
* Direct debit (pre-authorized debit)
* Standing order (automatic regular funds transfers)
* Electronic funds transfers (transfer funds electronically to another account)
* Online banking (transfer funds directly to another person via internet banking facility)

Banks offering transactional accounts may allow an account to go into overdraft if that has been previously arranged. If an account has a negative balance, money is being borrowed from the bank and interest and overdraft fees as normally charged.

== Country specific differences ==
In the United Kingdom and other countries with a UK banking heritage, transaction accounts are known as current accounts. These offer various flexible payment methods to allow customers to distribute money directly. One of the main differences between a UK current account and an American checking account is that they earn considerable interest, sometimes comparable to a savings account, and there is generally no charge for withdrawals at cashpoints (ATMs), other than charges by third party owners of such machines.

=== Transfer systems ===
Certain modes of payment are country-specific:
* Giro (funds transfer, direct deposit in European countries)
*In the United Kingdom, Faster Payments Service offers near immediate transfer, BACS offers giros that clear in a matter of days while CHAPS is done on the same day.
*Canada has an Interac e-Transfer service
*In India, NEFT and RTGS services are available to clear funds in a day.

=== In the European Union===
The Regulation (EU) n. 655/2014 has introduced the European Account Preservation Order, a new procedure of asset freezing in order &quot;to facilitate cross-border debt recovery in civil and commercial matters.&quot;

== Access ==
=== Branch access ===

Customers may need to attend a bank branch for a wide range of banking transactions including cash withdrawals and financial advice. There may be restrictions on cash withdrawals, even at a branch. For example, withdrawals of cash above a threshold figure may require notice.

Many transactions that previously could only be performed at a branch can now be done in others ways, such as use of ATMs, online, mobile and telephone banking.

===Cheques===
Cheques were the traditional method of making withdrawals from a transaction account.

=== Automated teller machines ===
Automated teller machines (ATMs) enable customers of a financial institution to perform financial transactions without attending a branch. This enables, for example, cash to be withdrawn from an account outside normal branch trading hours. However, ATMs usually have quite low limits for cash withdrawals, and there may be daily limits to cash withdrawals other than at a branch.

=== Mobile banking===

With the introduction of mobile banking; a customer may perform banking transactions and payments, view balances and statements, and use various other services using their mobile phone. In the UK this has become the leading way people manage their finances, as mobile banking has overtaken internet banking as the most popular way to bank.

=== Internet banking ===

Internet or online banking enables a customer to perform banking transactions and payments, to view balances and statements, and various other facilities. This can be convenient especially when a bank is not open and enables banking transactions to be effected from anywhere Internet access is available. Online banking avoids the time spent travelling to a branch and standing in queues there. However, there are usually limits on the value of funds that can be transferred electronically on any day, making it necessary to use a cheque to effect such transfers when those limits are being reached.

=== Telephone banking ===

Telephone banking provides access to banking transactions over the telephone. In many cases telephone banking opening times are considerably longer than branch times.

=== Mail banking ===

A financial institution may allow its customers to deposit cheques into their account by mail. Mail banking can be used by customers of virtual banks (as they may not offer branches or ATMs that accept deposits) and by customers who live too far from a branch.

=== Stores and merchants providing debit card access ===

Most stores and merchants now have to accept debit card access for purchasing goods if they want to continue operating, especially now that some people only use electronic means of purchase.

== Cost ==
Any cost or fees charged by the financial institution that maintains the account, whether as a single monthly maintenance charge or for each financial transaction, will depend on a variety of factors, including the country&#x27;s regulations and overall interest rates for lending and saving, as well as the financial institution&#x27;s size and number of channels of access offered. This is why a direct bank can afford to offer low-cost or free banking, as well as why in some countries, transaction fees do not exist but extremely high lending rates are the norm. This is the case in the United Kingdom, where they have had free banking since 1984 when the then Midland Bank, in a bid to grab market share, scrapped current account charges. It was so successful that all other banks had no choice but offer the same or continue losing customers. Free banking account holders are now charged only if they use an add-on service such as an overdraft.

Financial transaction fees may be charged either per item or for a flat rate covering a certain number of transactions. Often, youths, students, senior citizens or high-valued customers do not pay fees for basic financial transactions. Some offer free transactions for maintaining a very high average balance in their account. Other service charges are applicable for overdraft, non-sufficient funds, the use of an external interbank network, etc. In countries where there are no service charges for transaction fees, there are, on the other hand, other recurring service charges such as a debit card annual fee. In the United States, there are checking account options that do not require monthly maintenance fees and this can keep costs down. While a majority of U.S. checking accounts do charge monthly maintenance fees, about one-third of accounts do not charge those fees. A survey of monthly checking account maintenance fees shows the average cost to be $13.47 per month or $161.64 per year.

== Interest ==

Unlike savings accounts, for which the primary reason for depositing money is to generate interest, the main function of a transactional account is transactional. Therefore, most providers pay little or no interest on credit balances.

Formerly, in the United States, Regulation Q (12 CFR 217) and the Banking Acts of 1933 and 1935 (12 USC 371a) prohibited a member of the Federal Reserve system from paying interest on demand deposit accounts. Historically, this restriction was frequently circumvented by either creating an account type such as a Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account (NOW account), which is legally not a demand deposit account or by offering interest-paying chequing through a bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve system.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, however, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010, repealed the statutes that prohibit interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, effectively repealing Regulation Q (Pub. L. 111-203, Section 627). The repeal took effect on July 21, 2011. Since that date, financial institutions have been permitted, but not required, to offer interest-bearing demand deposit accounts.

In the United Kingdom, some online banks offer rates higher as many savings accounts, along with free banking (no charges for transactions) as institutions that offer centralised services (telephone, internet or postal based) tend to pay higher levels of interest. The same holds true for banks within the EURO currency zone.

=== High-yield accounts ===
High-yield accounts pay a higher interest rate than typical NOW accounts and frequently function as loss-leaders to drive relationship banking.

== Lending ==
Accounts can lend money in two ways: overdraft and offset mortgage.

=== Overdraft ===

An overdraft occurs when withdrawals from a bank account exceed the available balance. This gives the account a negative balance and in effect means the account provider is providing credit. If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft facility, and the amount overdrawn is within this authorised overdraft, then interest is normally charged at the agreed rate. If the balance exceeds the agreed facility then fees may be charged and a higher interest rate might apply.

In North America, overdraft protection is an optional feature of a chequing account. An account holder may either apply for a permanent one, or the financial institution may, at its discretion, provide a temporary overdraft on an ad hoc basis.

In the UK, virtually all current accounts offer a pre-agreed overdraft facility the size of which is based upon affordability and credit history. This overdraft facility can be used at any time without consulting the bank and can be maintained indefinitely (subject to ad hoc reviews). Although an overdraft facility may be authorised, technically the money is repayable on demand by the bank. In reality this is a rare occurrence as the overdrafts are profitable for the bank and expensive for the customer.

===Consumer reporting===
In the United States, some consumer reporting agencies such as ChexSystems, Early Warning Services, and TeleCheck track how people manage their checking accounts. Banks use the agencies to screen checking account applicants. Those with low debit scores are denied checking accounts because a bank cannot afford an account to be overdrawn.

=== Offset mortgage ===

An offset mortgage was a type of mortgage common in the United Kingdom used for the purchase of domestic property. The key principle is the reduction of interest charged by &quot;offsetting&quot; a credit balance against the mortgage debt. This can be achieved via one of two methods: either lenders provide a single account for all transactions (often referred to as a current account mortgage) or they make multiple accounts available, which let the borrower notionally split money according to purpose, whilst all accounts are offset each day against the mortgage debt.

<text>The Art Car Museum is a private museum of contemporary art located in Houston, Texas, United States. The museum, nicknamed the &quot;Garage Mahal,&quot; opened in February, 1998. Its emphasis is on art cars, fine arts, and artists that are rarely seen in other cultural institutions. The museum&#x27;s mission is to elevate awareness of the political, economic, and personal dimensions of art.

The museum was founded by Ann Harithas, artist and long-time supporter of the Art Car movement, and James Harithas, former director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., the Everson Museum of Art, Syracuse, New York, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston and late director of the Station Museum, Houston, Texas.

The museum showroom celebrates the spirit of this post-modern age of car-culture, in which artists have remolded stock cars to the specifications of their own idiosyncratic images and visions. The museum features elaborate art cars, lowriders, and mobile contraptions, as well as organizing a number of temporary exhibitions by local, national, and international artists, some accompanied by catalogs, such as a retrospective of the social/political, pointillist paintings by Houston artist Ron Hoover (1944-2008) held in 2010. and a survey of the work of artist John Atlas in 2014.

The museum is scheduled to re-open in the The Orange Show. Previously it was located at 140 Heights Blvd, Houston, TX 77007, which began operations in 1998. The Houston Heights location closed in April 2024.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 58, commonly referred to as Highway 58, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The route is divided into two segments with a combined length of . The southern segment travels from Niagara Regional Road 3, formerly Highway 3, in Port Colborne, to the Highway 58A junction in the southern end of Welland, a distance of . The northern segment begins at Highway 20 near Allanburg and travels north and west to a large junction with Highway 406 at the St. Catharines – Thorold boundary, a distance of . An gap separates the two segments within Welland and Pelham. The entire route is located within the Regional Municipality of Niagara.

The history of Highway 58 is tumultuous due to various relocation projects resulting from the construction of the fourth Welland Canal and Highway 406. Prior to 1997, Highway 58 was continuous and travelled through the west side of Welland, maintained under a Connecting Link agreement. The route was first established in 1935, though it remained unnumbered on the 1935 and 1936 official road maps. By 1937 it extended from Port Colborne to St. Catharines, though the route it travelled between those places shifted several times over the following 30 years. In the late 1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) transferred several highways or portions of highways throughout the province to lower levels of government. Highway 58 was decommissioned through Welland on April 1, 1997.

== Route description ==
The segment between Highway 406 in Thorold and Niagara Road 57 east of Thorold is a four-lane freeway. It also contains the Thorold Tunnel, one of the three tunnels under the Welland Canal. The remaining segments vary between a two-lane rural highway and four-lane urban roadway. Overall, the highway is in length, with a gap separating the two sections.

The southern section of Highway 58 begins at a junction with the former Highway 3 in the city of Port Colborne, several kilometres north of Lake Erie. South of this intersection, the road once continued as Niagara Regional Road 64 to Killaly Street; such has since been downloaded to the city of Port Colborne. Proceeding north, the highway, known locally as West Side Road, passes through the suburbs of Port Colborne, north of which it skirts the eastern edge of the Wainfleet Bog, one of the few remaining habitats of the Massasauga Rattlesnake.
West of Dain City, Highway 58 crosses the Port Colborne – Welland boundary at Forks Road, a grade-separated intersection. The route crosses several rail lines on a bridge south of its terminus at Highway 58A (Humberstone Road) at the southern edge of the built up area of Welland. North of there, it continues as Niagara Regional Road 54 (Prince Charles Drive)
The northern section of Highway 58 begins at an intersection with the western terminus of Highway 20, approximately east of Highway 406, within Thorold. South of this intersection, the road that carries Highway 58 continues as Niagara Regional Road 82, whereas west of the intersection the road that carries Highway 20, Lundy&#x27;s Lane, continues as Niagara Regional Road 58 through Allanburg. Highway 58 proceeds north, at first along an established concession road, before branching to the east on its own alignment known as Davis Road. The route crosses several flooded valleys that form part of the Welland Canal before arriving at Thorold Stone Road, at which point Highway 58 turns west and enters the Thorold Tunnel, descending beneath the canal.

At the western end of the tunnel, Highway 58 emerges as a divided highway in Thorold. It meets an interchange with Pine Street; the eastbound on-ramp from Pine Street features a stop sign and no merging lane prior to entering the Thorold Tunnel. West of Pine Street, the route passes beneath a Trillium Railway line and curves slightly southwest. It encounters an interchange with Collier Street, gradually curving to the northwest and passing beneath Richmond Street. Highway 58 ends at a complicated interchange with both St. Davids Road as well as Highway 406 on the edge of the Niagara Escarpment.

== History ==
The first portion of what became Highway 58 was assumed on September4, 1935. Although only a short stub travelling south from Main Street in Welland (then Highway 3A), it connected to a road owned by the Welland Canal Authority (WCA) travelling along the east side of the old canal,
now known by various names including Barber Drive, Canal Road, Kingsway, and Canal Bank Street. Initially unnumbered, the route was extended to Port Colborne and St. Catharines on October 6, 1937,
and by then had been given the designation of Highway 58. It now began at Highway 3 in Port Colborne and travelled to Welland along the east side of the canal, and thereafter north along Niagara Street, the Merrittville Highway and Glenridge Road (Niagara Regional Road 50) to Highway 8 in downtown St. Catharines.

On July 17 and 30, 1958, the Department of Highways assumed the West Side Road, constructed in the years prior by Welland County between Port Colborne and Welland.
The old highway was turned back to the WCA on June 26 and September 4 of that same year.
Highway 58 then entered Welland along what is now Prince Charles Drive, meeting and becoming concurrent with Highway 3A at Riverside Drive / Lincoln Street and then turning east along East Main Street.
By 1960, the Welland Bypass was completed along the routing of the former Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway interurban line – the final operating interurban railway in Canada, which ceased operations on the line on March 28, 1959.
This rerouted the highway along what is now Prince Charles Drive northwest to Thorold Road, where it turned east to Niagara Street.

North of Welland, Highway 58 initially travelled concurrent with Highway 3A along Niagara Street and the Merrittville Highway to Highway 20, where Highway 3A ended. Highway 58 turned east and travelled concurrent with Highway 20 across the Welland Canal at Allanburg, before turning north onto the current route. However, it continued north along Allanburg Road into Thorold, where it crossed the Welland Canal on a swing bridge and travelled north into St. Catharines along Ormond Street, Merritt Street and Hartzel Road (Niagara Regional Road 52) to Highway 8 (Queenston Street, now Niagara Regional Road 81).

=== Effect of the Thorold Tunnel and Highway 406 ===
The routing of Highway 58 was eventually upheaved by two major changes within the Niagara Peninsula. The first was the construction of the Thorold Tunnel, which was built as part of the larger Welland Bypass project of the Welland Canal in order to minimize road and rail crossings that plagued the length of the canal prior to the 1970s. The Thorold Tunnel was designed to carry a divided four lane road beneath the canal, bypassing the swinging bridge between Allanburg Road and Ormond Street. It was built during the winter months between 1965 and 1967, with the canal drained,
and opened on September 18, 1968.
Following its completion, Highway 58 was rerouted through the tunnel, west of which it forked. At the Pine Road interchange, one fork travelled north on Pine, east along Richmond Street and north along Ormond Street (now Niagara Regional Road 52). The other fork followed the present route. As part of the creation of the Regional Municipality of Niagara, Highway 8 was transferred to the newly formed region as well as the original alignment of Highway 58.

The second change was the initial construction of Highway 406 in the mid-1960s, establishing a new northern terminus for Highway 58 at the St. Davids Road interchange on the Niagara Escarpment. The St. Davids Road interchange was fully opened with the Highway 406 extension to Beaverdams Road on November 21, 1969.
Eventually Highway 406 would reroute the section of Highway 58 along the Merrittville Highway between Welland and Highway 20 to instead turn east from Niagara Street along Merritt Road, where it curved north to become the two-laned Highway 406.
This happened when Highway 406 was extended south from Beaverdams Road to Merritt Road on June 30, 1971.

=== Downloading ===
Budget constraints brought on by a recession in the 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the &quot;Who Does What?&quot; committee in 1995 to determine cost-cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred by former premier Bob Rae.
It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network.
As Highway 58 had largely been replaced by Highway 406, the central segment through Welland and Pelham was deemed to no longer serve long-distance traffic, and was downloaded to the Regional Municipality of Niagara on April 1, 1997.
It now exists as Regional Road 54 along Prince Charles Drive and Regional Road 50 along Niagara Street and the Merrittville Highway.

No part of Highway 58 today follows the original 1935 route along the Welland Canal. Only a section of the 1937 routing, north from Highway 20 (Lundy&#x27;s Lane) is still used by the route now.

<text>Cheshunt ( ) is a town in the Borough of Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, England, north of Central London on the River Lea and Lee Navigation and directly south of Broxbourne. It contains a section of the Lee Valley Park, including much of the River Lee Country Park. To the north lies Broxbourne and Wormley, Waltham Abbey to the east, Waltham Cross and Enfield to the south, and Cuffley to the west.

Historically an ancient parish in the Hertford hundred of Hertfordshire, it was granted urban district status in 1894. Waltham Cross, which became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1885, historically formed the southern part of Cheshunt, and remained part of the Cheshunt Urban District until its abolition in 1974. The urban districts of Cheshunt and Hoddesdon merged in 1974 to form the Borough of Broxbourne, the area&#x27;s current local authority district. Cheshunt was not re-established as a successor parish.

At the 2011 census, Cheshunt had a population of 45,832.

== History and geography ==
The Prime Meridian passes to the east of Cheshunt.

The town name comes from the Old English name (as recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;) for the area, &quot;Cestrehunt&quot;, which probably refers to a &quot;castle, erected by the Romans&quot;, the word &quot;cestre&quot; (along with the form &quot;ceastre&quot;), or even its modern forms, chester and caster being derived from the Latin &quot;castrum&quot; meaning &quot;fort&quot;. This is commemorated in the arms of the former Cheshunt urban district council.

Cheshunt was a settlement on Ermine Street, the main Roman road leading north from London. Before the Norman Conquest, the manor of Cheshunt was held by Eddeva the Fair, but William I granted it to Alan of Brittany. The parish church of St Mary the Virgin was first recorded in a charter of 1146, but was entirely rebuilt between 1418 and 1448 with a three-stage tower topped by an octagonal turret.

As Princess Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth I lived at Cheshunt in the care of Sir Anthony Denny, after she left Queen Catherine Parr&#x27;s household in 1548. As Queen, she stayed with the Cecil family at Theobalds Palace. King James I later lived at Theobalds and died there in 1625. Richard Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth, died in Cheshunt in 1712. The historic palace site is now Cedars Park and holds historical and national significance.

In 1825, Cheshunt was also the location of the Cheshunt Railway. Running from the town&#x27;s High Street to the River Lea near the present-day Cheshunt railway station, this horse-drawn line was the first passenger-carrying monorail and the first railway line to be built in Hertfordshire.

The town&#x27;s Bury Green neighbourhood was once the home of singer Cliff Richard. Lotus Cars as well as the central headquarters the Debenhams store chain were formerly located in Cheshunt, and the headquarters of Tesco, the UK&#x27;s largest supermarket chain, was located here until 2016. In 2002, Cheshunt hosted the only officially licensed European BotCon convention ever.

In 1957, a review of how London was governed was undertaken by government and led by Sir Edwin Herbert, who was appointed to create a new administrative area for London which encompassed more of the city&#x27;s conurbation than the existing one. Initially, Cheshunt (including Waltham Cross) was planned to become part of a borough with Enfield; however, the plan was eventually dropped and Cheshunt did not become part of Greater London.

The Metropolitan Police Service served Cheshunt until 2000, when policing was taken over by Hertfordshire Constabulary.

Being located in the Lea Valley, Cheshunt has access to the Lee Valley Park. The park is accessible at many points, one being extremely close to the town&#x27;s railway station at Windmill Lane.

At 8:00 am on 12 August 1944, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber from the United States Army Air Forces 392nd Bombardment Group (Heavy), based at RAF Wendling, crashed next to Maxwells Farm, near Cheshunt, killing all ten crew. The section of the B198 which runs near the crash site has been renamed Lieutenant Ellis Way, after the pilot, who managed to avoid crashing into the nearby town. One of the firemen who attended the scene secured funding in 2010 for a permanent memorial at the scene (at the entrance to St Mary&#x27;s School).
Up until 2004, Temple Bar stood in Theobalds Park, having been moved from London at the turn of the nineteenth century. The gateway has since been re-erected in London at Paternoster Square on the north side of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Governance==
Cheshunt has two tiers of local government, at district and county level: Broxbourne Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council. There is no parish or town council in Cheshunt, which has been an unparished area since 1974.

Historically, the parish of Cheshunt was in the hundred of Hertford. As well as Cheshunt itself, the parish also included Waltham Cross. From 1837 the parish of Cheshunt was included in the Edmonton Poor Law Union.

On 13 July 1850 the parish of Cheshunt was made a local board of health district. After elections, the first meeting of the Cheshunt Local Board of Health was held in October 1850, with John Sanders being appointed the first chairman of the board. Under the Local Government Act 1894, Cheshunt Local Board became Cheshunt Urban District Council on 31 December 1894. For the first few years the council used St Mary&#x27;s Hall on College Road as its offices and meeting place, as the Local Board had done.

Around 1901 the council moved to a large 1860s house called the Manor House at 22 Turners Hill (not to be confused with Cheshunt Great House). Cheshunt&#x27;s public library was built in the grounds of the Manor House in 1907.

Cheshunt Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 25 November 1944.

Cheshunt Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the borough of Broxbourne on 1 April 1974. No successor parish was created for the town, and so it became an unparished area. The Manor House was demolished in the 1980s and Edwards Court built on the site.

== Industry ==
Cheshunt&#x27;s best-known employer was Tesco, whose head office was in Delamare Road, Cheshunt for many years. A small store in the town centre is still open today, while &quot;Home &#x27;n&#x27; Wear&quot; store, which was situated across the Old Pond in College Road, is now closed. In 1983 a new out-of-town Tesco store located to the north of the town opened, named &quot;Brookfield Farm&quot;. It later expanded, a branch of Marks &amp; Spencer was built next door, and the entire estate was renamed &quot;The Brookfield Centre&quot;. Tesco announced in 2015 that it would move its headquarters to Welwyn Garden City.

In 1959, Colin Chapman moved his fledgling Lotus group of companies, including Lotus Cars and Team Lotus, from its outgrown premises at Hornsey to a purpose-built facility on Delamare Road. Racing cars from here won the first two of its seven constructor championships in ( and ) before moving to Hethel, Norfolk, in 1966.

Until the late 1960s the main land use around Cheshunt was for its nursery industry, and many new techniques for growing under glass were developed here. Thomas Rochford had a large concern here, although now almost all the glasshouses have been redeveloped into housing estates. This is often reflected in the names of the roads or estates, such as Rosedale or Thomas Rochford Way. A small amount of nursery trade survives to the west of the town. The neighbouring town of Goffs Oak had a large number of nurseries as well as a large garden centre, but these have since been closed and redeveloped as mid-range housing developments.

The River Lee Navigation passes the east of Cheshunt and was used for the transport of flowers and crops to the London markets for many years until road transport became more viable. A wharf existed just east of the railway on the site now occupied by Herts Young Mariners Base. The Youth Hostel was built on the site of the derelict open-air swimming pool.

&quot;Cheshunt Compound&quot;, a fungicide developed at the Cheshunt Research Station, was widely used by amateur and professional gardeners but has been withdrawn from sale in the UK since November 2010 and it is no longer legal to use it. It was a mixture of copper sulphate and ammonium carbonate.

From the end of World War II a large area of the River Lea flood plain was used for sand and gravel extraction which resulted in the creation of the now mature lakes which are popular with anglers, birdwatchers and naturalists. The area now forms part of the River Lee Country Park and the Turnford and Cheshunt Pits SSSI.

The non-conformist theological college Cheshunt College moved to Cheshunt in the 1790s from Trevecca, Brecknockshire. It moved to Cambridge in 1905. Between 1909 and 1968 the buildings were occupied by the Church of England&#x27;s Bishop&#x27;s College. Since 1972 they have been council offices and formerly a music and business school (typing and accountancy), which had to be demolished due to it being unsafe. In the 1980s parts of the building were so unsafe it was closed and demolished. The main problem was the floors had begun to disintegrate. A new council office was built on the site of the old school. The council chamber and registry office are now in the same building that contains the &quot;Huntingdon Rooms&quot;.

<text>William Scott Ritter Jr. (born July 15, 1961) is an American former United States Marine Corps intelligence officer, former United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) weapons inspector, author, and commentator. 

Ritter was a junior military analyst during Operation Desert Storm. He served as a member of UNSCOM overseeing the disarmament of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq from 1991 to 1998, from which he resigned in protest. Later he became a critic of the Iraq War and United States foreign policy in the Middle East. In recent years, he has been a regular contributor to Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik. He has visited Russia in support of Russia since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In June 2024, Ritter claimed that US authorities seized his passport and prevented him from visiting Russia. 

In 2011, Ritter was convicted of several criminal offenses after engaging in sexually explicit online activity with a police officer who was posing as a 15 year-old girl.

==Early and personal life==

The son of an Air Force officer and a military nurse, Ritter was born into a military family in 1961 in Gainesville, Florida. He graduated from Kaiserslautern American High School in Kaiserslautern west of Mannheim, Germany in 1979. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He studied the history of the Soviet Union there and received departmental honors.

While working in Votkinsk as an intelligence offer, Ritter met his second wife Marina Khatiashvili, a Soviet translator from Georgia. The couple married in 1991 and have two children; twin daughters.

==Military background==

In 1980, Ritter served in the U.S. Army as a private. In May 1984, he was commissioned as an intelligence officer in the United States Marine Corps. He served in this capacity for about 12 years. He was the lead analyst for the Marine Corps Rapid Deployment Force concerning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iran–Iraq War. His academic work focused on the Basmachi resistance movement in Soviet Central Asia during the 1920s and 1930s, and on the Basmachi commanders Faizal Maksum and Ibrahim Bek.

During Desert Storm (1991), as a Marine captain, he served as a ballistic missile intelligence analyst under General Norman Schwarzkopf. Ritter filed multiple internal reports challenging Schwarzkopf&#x27;s claim that the US had destroyed &quot;as many as 16&quot; of Iraq&#x27;s estimated 20 mobile Scud missile launchers, arguing that they could not be confirmed. In 1992 Ritter was quoted in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed saying &quot;No mobile Scud launchers were destroyed during the war.&quot; He later worked as a security and military consultant for the Fox News network. In an interview with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; in 2003 he said he had &quot;a long relationship [...] of an official nature&quot; with the UK&#x27;s foreign intelligence spy agency MI6.

==Weapons inspector==

Ritter worked as a weapons inspector for the United Nations Special Commission from 1991 to 1998, which was charged with finding and destroying all weapons of mass destruction and WMD-related manufacturing capabilities in Iraq. He was the chief inspector in fourteen of more than thirty inspection missions in which he participated.

Ritter was among a group of UNSCOM weapons inspectors which regularly took Lockheed U-2 imagery to Israel for analysis, as UNSCOM was not getting sufficient analysis assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom. That was not authorized by UNSCOM, the U-2 jet had been loaned to UNSCOM and caused him to be subjected to criticism and investigation by U.S. authorities. Iraq protested about information being given to Israel.

===Operation Mass Appeal===

Beginning in December 1997, Ritter, with the approval of UNSCOM head Richard Butler and other top UNSCOM leaders, began to supply the UK&#x27;s foreign intelligence service MI6 with documents and briefings on UNSCOM&#x27;s findings to be used for MI6&#x27;s propaganda effort dubbed &quot;Operation Mass Appeal&quot;: &quot;I was approached by the British intelligence service, which I had, again, a long relationship with, of an official nature, to see if there was any information in the archives of UNSCOM that could be handed to the British, so that they could in turn work it over, determine its veracity, and then seek to plant it in media outlets around the world, in an effort to try to shape the public opinion of those countries, and then indirectly, through, for instance, a report showing up in the Polish press, shape public opinion in Great Britain and the United States. I went to Richard Butler with the request from the British. He said that he supported this, and we initiated a cooperation that was very short-lived. The first reports were passed to the British sometime in February of 1998. There was a detailed planning meeting in June of 1998, and I resigned in August of 1998.[...] This is an operation—Operation Mass Appeal, that had been going on prior to UNSCOM being asked to be the source of particular data, and it&#x27;s an operation that continued after my resignation.&quot;

=== Last weapons inspections in 1998 ===

In January 1998, Ritter&#x27;s inspection team in Iraq was blocked from some weapons sites by Iraqi officials who said that information obtained from the sites would be used for future planning of attacks. UN Inspectors then left Iraq, shortly before Operation Desert Fox attacks began in December 1998, using information which had been gathered for the purpose of disarmament to identify targets which would reduce Iraq&#x27;s ability to wage both conventional and possibly unconventional warfare. UN weapons inspectors were thereafter denied access to Iraq. Ritter spoke on the PBS show, &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;: &quot;I think the danger right now is that without effective inspections, without effective monitoring, Iraq can in a very short period of time measured in months, reconstitute chemical and biological weapons, long-range ballistic missiles to deliver these weapons, and even certain aspects of their developing of nuclear weapons program.&quot;

When the United States and the UN Security Council failed to take action against Iraq for their ongoing failure to cooperate fully with inspectors (a breach of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1154), Ritter resigned from the United Nations Special Commission on August 26, 1998. In his letter of resignation, Ritter said that the Security Council&#x27;s reaction to Iraq&#x27;s decision earlier that month to suspend co-operation with the inspection team made a mockery of the disarmament work. Ritter later said in an interview, that he resigned from his role as a United Nations weapons inspector over inconsistencies between United Nations Security Council Resolution 1154 and how it was implemented: &quot;The investigations had come to a standstill, were making no effective progress, and in order to make effective progress, we really needed the Security Council to step in a meaningful fashion and seek to enforce its resolutions that we&#x27;re not complying with.&quot;

On September 3, 1998, several days after his resignation, Ritter testified before the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services and the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and said that he resigned his position &quot;out of frustration that the United Nations Security Council, and the United States as its most significant supporter, was failing to enforce the post-Gulf War resolutions designed to disarm Iraq.&quot; According to him Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had supposedly &quot;blocked more inspections in 1997 than Saddam Hussein did,&quot; a charge which Albright disputed.

During the testimony on September 3, 1998, Ritter was asked by then-Senator Joe Biden about his position on inspections, which Biden criticized as &quot;confrontation-based policy.&quot; According to Barton Gellman, Biden questioned if the inspector was trying to &quot;appropriate the power &#x27;to decide when to pull the trigger&#x27; of military force against Iraq,&quot; with Biden saying that the Secretary of State would also have to consider the opinion of allies, the United Nations Security Council and public opinion, before any potential intervention in Iraq. Later on, Biden stated that the decision was &quot;above [Ritter&#x27;s] pay grade.&quot; According to Gellman, Senate Democrats joined Biden and &quot;amplified on the Clinton administration&#x27;s counterattack [against] Scott Ritter&quot; with exceptions such as John Kerry, while Senate Republicans &quot;were unanimous in describing Ritter&#x27;s disclosures as highly damaging to the credibility of the Clinton administration on one of its core foreign policies.&quot;

Ritter&#x27;s testimony was disputed by Richard Butler, chief UN arms inspector for Iraq, who claimed that Ritter made factual errors and harmed UNSCOM&#x27;s mission. The previous chief inspector for Iraq, Rolf Ekéus, said that Ritter was &quot;not in a position to know all of the considerations that go into decision making on the commission,&quot; and defended Albright&#x27;s support for UNSCOM. Albright publicly disputed Ritter&#x27;s claims in a speech, saying &quot;In fact, the United States has been by far the strongest international backer of UNSCOM. We have provided indispensable technical and logistical support. We&#x27;ve pushed and pushed and pushed some more to help UNSCOM break through the smoke screen of lies and deceptions put out by the Iraqi regime.&quot;

===Reception as weapons inspector===

Butler, Ritter&#x27;s former UNSCOM boss, said that Ritter &quot;wasn&#x27;t prescient&quot; in his predictions about WMDs, saying, &quot;When he was the &#x27;Alpha Dog&#x27; inspector, then by God, there were more weapons there, and we had to go find them a contention for which he had inadequate evidence. When he became a peacenik, then it was all complete B.S., start to finish, and there were no weapons of mass destruction... that also was a contention for which he had inadequate evidence.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Matt Bai said that Butler&#x27;s caveat notwithstanding, Ritter was in fact vindicated about Iraq&#x27;s lack of WMDs and that the aftermath of the war could be calamitous. Bai described Ritter as the &quot;most determined dissenter and the one with the most on-the-ground intelligence&quot; of the situation in Iraq prior to the war.

However, Bai went on to compare Ritter&#x27;s insistence during his 2011 trial for sex offenses that his conduct was of no consequence to the wider community—and his unwillingness to consider a plea agreement—to the stridency with which Ritter advocated for his views on Iraq: &quot;If there is a connection between Ritter the activist and Ritter the accused, though, it probably lies in the uncompromising, even heedless way in which he insists on his version of reality, and how he sees himself always as the victim of a system that is self-evidently corrupt. ... the very attribute that made Scott Ritter appear somehow clairvoyant on Iraq—his refusal to accede to everyone else&#x27;s sense of reality—is the same one that has led him, now, to ruin.&quot;

==U.S. policy toward Iraq==
After his resignation from UNSCOM, Ritter continued to be an outspoken commentator on U.S. policy toward Iraq, particularly with respect to the WMD issue. He became a popular anti-war figure and talk show commentator.

===Ritter and Operation Desert Fox===

In a 2005 interview, Ritter criticized the Clinton administration&#x27;s use of a blocked inspection of a Ba&#x27;ath party headquarters to justify Operation Desert Fox, a three-day bombing campaign in December 1998. During the bombing, inspectors were withdrawn from Iraq and they did not return until late 2002. However, in his 1999 book &quot;Endgame&quot;, Ritter says that he was the one who had originally pushed for the fateful inspection of the Ba&#x27;ath party headquarters over the doubts of Butler, his boss, and also planned to use 37 inspectors. It was temporarily canceled because Iraq broke off cooperation in August 1998.

===Commentary in the post-inspection period===
In &quot;Endgame: Solving the Iraq Problem — Once and For All&quot;, Ritter reiterated that Iraq had obstructed the work of inspectors and attempted to hide and preserve essential elements for restarting WMD programs at a later date. However, he also expressed frustration at alleged attempts by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to infiltrate UNSCOM and use the inspectors as a means of gathering intelligence with which to pursue regime change in Iraq–a violation of the terms under which UNSCOM operated, and the very rationale the Iraqi government had given in restricting the inspector&#x27;s activities in 1998. In the book&#x27;s conclusion, he criticized the U.S. policy of containment in the absence of inspections as inadequate to prevent Iraq&#x27;s re-acquisition of WMD&#x27;s in the long term. Ritter also rejected the notion of removing Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime by force. Instead, he advocated a policy of diplomatic engagement, leading to gradual normalization of international relations with Iraq in return for diplomatic recognition of Kuwait, Kurdish autonomy and de-escalation of tensions with Israel.

Ritter again promoted a conciliatory approach toward Iraq in the 2000 documentary &quot;In Shifting Sands: The Truth About UNSCOM and the Disarming of Iraq&quot;, which he wrote and directed. The film is about the history of the UNSCOM investigations through interviews and video footage of inspection missions. In the film, Ritter argues that Iraq is a &quot;defanged tiger&quot; and that the inspections were successful in eliminating significant Iraqi WMD capabilities. (For more see below under &quot;Documentary&quot;.)

In 2002, Ritter traveled to Iraq to address the Iraqi Parliament as a private citizen. He told the parliament that the U.S. was about to make an &quot;historical mistake&quot; and urged it to allow inspections to resume.

===Iraq War predictions===

Just after the coalition invasion of Iraq was launched but prior to troops arriving in Baghdad, British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the Parliament of the United Kingdom that the United States and the United Kingdom believed they had &quot;sufficient forces&quot; in Iraq. At the same time Ritter offered an opposing view on Portuguese radio station TSF: &quot;The United States is going to leave Iraq with its tail between its legs, defeated. It is a war we can not win... We do not have the military means to take over Baghdad and for this reason I believe the defeat of the United States in this war is inevitable... Every time we confront Iraqi troops we may win some tactical battles, as we did for ten years in Vietnam, but we will not be able to win this war, which in my opinion is already lost.&quot;

===Commentary on Iraq&#x27;s lack of WMDs===

Despite identifying as a Republican and having voted for George W. Bush in 2000, by 2002, Ritter was an outspoken critic of the Bush administration&#x27;s claims that Iraq possessed significant WMD stocks or manufacturing capabilities, the primary rationale given for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Prior to the war, Ritter said that the U.S.and British governments were using the presence of WMD&#x27;s in Iraq as a political excuse for war. His views at the time are summarized in &quot;War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn&#x27;t Want You To Know&quot; a 2002 publication which consists largely of an interview between Ritter and anti-war activist William Rivers Pitt.

===Later statements on Iraq===

In February 2005, writing on Al Jazeera&#x27;s website, Ritter wrote that the &quot;Iraqi resistance&quot; is a &quot;genuine grassroots national liberation movement,&quot; and &quot;History will eventually depict as legitimate the efforts of the Iraqi resistance to destabilize and defeat the American occupation forces and their imposed Iraqi collaborationist government.&quot; In 2012, Ritter said that the U.S. was &quot;bankrupt, morally and fiscally, because of this war. The United States is the laughingstock of the world&quot;.

==U.S. policy toward Iran==

On February 6, 2006, in the James A. Little Theater in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ritter talked about a U.S. war with Iran: &quot;We just don&#x27;t know when, but it&#x27;s going to happen,&quot; and said that after the U.N. Security Council will have found no evidence of WMD, then Under Secretary of State John Bolton &quot;will deliver a speech that has already been written. It says America cannot allow Iran to threaten the United States and we must unilaterally defend ourselves.&quot; and continued &quot;How do I know this? I&#x27;ve talked to Bolton&#x27;s speechwriter&quot;.

Ritter&#x27;s book &quot;Target Iran: The Truth About the White House&#x27;s Plans for Regime Change&quot; was published in 2006. Nathan Guttman in his review for &quot;The Forward&quot; said Ritter accused the &quot;pro-Israel lobby of dual loyalty and &#x27;outright espionage&#x27;&quot;. Ritter said that Israel was pushing the Bush administration into war with Iran. He accused the pro-Israel lobby of invoking the Holocaust and of making false claims of antisemitism. Ritter told &quot;The Forward&quot; &quot;at the end of the day, I would like to believe that most of American Jews will side with America.&quot;

Con Coughlin in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote about Ritter&#x27;s writings of the government in Iran. Coughlin wrote that Ritter said &quot;that the Bush administration is in danger of making the same mistake over Iran that it did during the build-up to the Iraq war, namely getting the facts to fit the administration&#x27;s policy of effecting regime change in Tehran&quot;. Coughlin said, Ritter concedes the &quot;measures the Iranians have taken in pursuit of nuclear glory&quot; which include the &quot;concealing the existence of key nuclear facilities&quot;.

==&quot;In Shifting Sands&quot;==

Ritter&#x27;s documentary &quot;In Shifting Sands&quot; was released in 2001. It argues that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction because of the UN weapons inspection program. According to &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, his documentary was partially financed by Iraqi American businessman Shakir al Khafaji. Al-Khafaji pleaded guilty to multiple felony charges in 2004 for his involvement in the U.N. Oil-for-Food scandal.

Ritter said that there was no quid pro quo with Al-Khafaji and he told Al-Khafaji the financing &quot;can have no connection to the Iraqi government&quot;. Ritter was asked &quot;how he would characterize anyone suggesting that Mr. Khafaji was offering allocations in [his] name&quot;, he replied: &quot;I&#x27;d say that person&#x27;s a __ liar... and tell him to come over here so I can kick his _.&quot;

==Arrests and conviction for sex offenses==

Ritter was the subject of two law enforcement sting operations in 2001. He was charged in June 2001 with trying to set up a meeting with an undercover police officer posing as a 16-year-old girl. He was charged with a misdemeanor crime of &quot;attempted endangerment of the welfare of a child&quot;. The charge was dismissed and the record was sealed after he completed six months of pre-trial probation. Ritter suggested at the time that the case, which coincided with his prominent dissent against the buildup to the Iraq War, was a smear campaign designed to silence him. 

Ritter was arrested again in November 2009 over communications with a police decoy he met on an Internet chat site. Police said that he exposed himself, via a web camera, after the officer repeatedly identified himself as a 15-year-old girl. The next month, Ritter waived his right to a preliminary hearing and was released on $25,000 unsecured bail. Charges included &quot;unlawful contact with a minor, criminal use of a communications facility, corruption of minors, indecent exposure, possessing instruments of crime, criminal attempt and criminal solicitation&quot;. Ritter rejected a plea bargain and was found guilty of all but the criminal attempt count in county court in Rochester, New York on April 14, 2011. In October 2011, he was sentenced to one and a half to five and a half years in prison. He was sent to Laurel Highlands state prison in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, in March 2012 and paroled in September 2014.

==Depression, Delmar Fire department==

In the early 2000s, Ritter and his wife, Marina, joined  Delmar, New York&#x27;s volunteer fire department. Delmar is southwest of Albany. Ritter became one of its most active members and was eventually selected as an assistant chief. According to court testimony, by 2004 when he stopped attending therapy, he had made an almost daily habit of trying to meet women from internet chat rooms, in cars or out-of-the-way places, so they could watch him masturbate. He has blamed this behavior on his ongoing depression. 

In 2009, when Scott Ritter&#x27;s arrest became public, he lost the only regular job he had had in recent years—writing analyses on world events for a private energy firm—and was reported to be heavily in debt. Also at the time, Ritter was removed from active duties in the Delmar Fire department, something he described as “one of the most profound disappointments I have experienced.”

== Russian invasion of Ukraine ==

In April 2022, shortly after the start of the Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Ritter tweeted that the National Police of Ukraine was responsible for the Bucha massacre and U.S. President Joe Biden was a &quot;war criminal&quot; for &quot;seeking to shift blame for the Bucha murders&quot; to Russia. Ritter apparently had not commented previously on Ukraine, or Russia. Human Rights Watch found evidence linking the killings to the Russian military. He was suspended from Twitter for violating its rule on &quot;harassment and abuse&quot; afterwards but his account was reinstated the next day. His strongly pro-Russian position quickly attracted negative international attention. In 2022, he became a contributor to Russian government-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik. He compared Ukraine to a &quot;rabid dog&quot; which needed to be shot. He compared the treatment of Russians under Ukrainian law to Nazi Germany&#x27;s treatment of Jews. In October 2022, he posted a provocative tweet about Bucha, &quot;Bucha was a war crime, Ukraine did it&quot;, to test the reaction of Twitter. 
DisInfoChronicle, a website of the NGO Detector Media which claims to refute Russian disinformation, wrote that Ritter was being used by Russia to &quot;promote narratives needed by the Kremlin&quot;.

In July 2022, the Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation included Ritter on a list of what it called Russian propagandists. In April 2022 and April 2023 Ritter said that Russia was winning the war. American government-owned news outlet Polygraph.info wrote that Ritter&#x27;s claims about Russia winning the war and about the Bucha massacre were false. In May 2023, Ritter began a book tour of Kazan, Irkutsk, and Yekaterinburg for his most recent book, &quot;Disarmament in the time of the Perestroika&quot;, which examines nuclear weapons agreements between Russia and the United States. According to &quot;Euronews&quot;, Ritter predicted that Ukraine would lose the war.

In January 2024, Ritter visited Chechnya, addressing thousands of Chechen fighters in a central square in Grozny, the capital. BBC journalist Francis Scarr called it &quot;one of the most surreal moments of the war yet.[...] Scott Ritter has turned up in Chechnya and spoken in broken Russian (some of which I couldn&#x27;t make out) to thousands of Ramzan Kadyrov&#x27;s fighters about his efforts to strengthen the &#x27;friendship between Chechnya and America&#x27;.&quot; In his speech, Ritter again repeated his belief that Russia will win its war with Ukraine. After Ritter&#x27;s speech in Grozny, where he was being welcomed as a guest of the Chechenya, Kadyrov made a public statement that he had given Ritter a list of 20 Ukrainian prisoners-of-war he was prepared to release in return for a lifting of US sanctions on him and his family. Kadyrov called his public statement &quot;trolling&quot; and said that it had not been serious.

==Passport seizure==

In June 2024, US authorities seized Ritter&#x27;s passport and prevented him from visiting Russia. According to Ritter, three U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents stopped him as he was about to board a flight to Istanbul going to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. He said that the agents never showed him a warrant and never gave him a receipt when they seized his passport. Vladimir Putin&#x27;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that &quot;details&quot; about the situation were not clear. Peskov also said that restricting the travel of former intelligence agents &quot;is practiced in almost all countries in relation to former intelligence officers&quot; and that if Ritter was removed from the flight to stop him from speaking in Russia, then it was part of a “frenzied campaign to prevent U.S. citizens from establishing at least some contacts with Russia&quot;.

==FBI raid==
On August 7, 2024, the FBI conducted a raid of Ritter&#x27;s home near Albany as part of efforts by the Department of Justice to combat Russian election interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers_Barnes_8/21/2014&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="455084" wikidata="Q128812" url="?curid=455084" title="Flag of Portugal">
<text>The national flag of the Portuguese Republic, often referred to as the Portuguese flag consists of a rectangular bicolour with a field divided into green on the hoist, and red on the fly. A lesser version of the country’s national coat of arms stands in the middle of the Portuguese armillary sphere and shield, centered over the colour boundary at equal distance. The flag was announced in 1910, following the 5 October 1910 revolution, inspired by the colours of the Republican Party and the design of radical conspiratorial society Carbonária.

Its presentation was done on 1 December 1910, after the downfall of the constitutional monarchy on 5 October 1910. However, it was only on 30 June 1911, that the official decree approving this flag as the official flag was published. This new national flag for the First Portuguese Republic, was selected by a special commission whose members included Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, João Chagas and Abel Botelho.
The conjugation of the new field color, especially the use of green, was not traditional in the Portuguese national flag&#x27;s composition and represented a radical republican-inspired change that broke the bond with the former monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on 31 January 1891, red and green had been established as the colours of the Portuguese Republican Party and its associated movements, whose political prominence kept growing until it reached a culmination period following the Republican revolution of 5 October 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandised, green represented the hope of the nation and the colour red represented the blood of those who died defending it, this happened to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment.

The sphere and shield in the middle of the current flag are an integral part of the design, which has historically been centred on the royal arms, usually over fields of blue and white. Since the country&#x27;s foundation, the standard developed from the blue cross-on-white armorial square banner of King Afonso I, through progressively more complex designs, which did incorporate green and red, to the liberal monarchy&#x27;s arms over a blue-and-white rectangle. In between, major changes associated with determinant political events contributed to its evolution into the current design.

==Design==
The decree that legally created the republican flag was approved by the Constituent Assembly and published in government journal no. 141 () on 19 June 1911. On 30 June, this decree had its regulations officially published in government diary no. 150. Nevertheless, the new flag had been first presented in 1910, on the national holiday of the Restoration of Independence (celebrating December 1, 1640), which was rededicated as the Day of the Flag, although this new designation did not erase the previous one.

===Construction===

The flag&#x27;s length is equal to times its width, which translates into an aspect ratio of 2:3. The background is vertically divided into two colours: dark green on the hoist side, and scarlet red on the fly. The colour division is made in a way that green spans of the length and the remaining is filled by red (ratio 2:3). The lesser version of the national coat of arms (without the laurel wreaths)—a white-rimmed national shield on top of a black-highlighted yellow armillary sphere—is positioned over the border between both colours.

The armillary sphere has a diameter equal to height and is equidistant from the upper and lower edges of the flag. The sphere, drawn in perspective, possesses six edge-embossed arcs, four of which are great circles and two are small circles.
The great circles represent the ecliptic (wider oblique arc), the equator, and two meridians. These last three are positioned so that the intersections between each two arcs make a right angle; one meridian lies on the flag&#x27;s plane, while the other is perpendicular to it.
The small circles consist of two parallels (the tropics), each tangent to one of the ecliptic-meridian intersections.

Vertically centered over the sphere is the national shield, a white-rimmed curved bottom red shield charged with a white inescutcheon. Its height and width are equal to and of the sphere&#x27;s diameter, respectively.
The shield is positioned in a way that its limits intersect the sphere:
*at the inflection points of the distal edges of the Tropic of Cancer&#x27;s anterior half (top) and Tropic of Capricorn&#x27;s posterior half (bottom);
*at the intersection of the lower edges of the ecliptic&#x27;s posterior half and of the equator&#x27;s anterior half (dexter or viewer&#x27;s left side); and
*at the intersection of the upper edge of the ecliptic&#x27;s anterior half with the lower edge of the equator&#x27;s posterior half (sinister or viewer&#x27;s right side).

A curious aspect of the official design is the absence of a segment of the Tropic of Capricorn, between the national shield and the ecliptic arc.

The white inescutcheon is itself charged with five smaller blue shields (&quot;escudetes&quot;) arranged like a Greek cross (1+3+1). Each smaller shield holds five white bezants displayed in the form of a saltire (2+1+2). The red bordure is charged with seven yellow castles: three on the chief portion (one in each corner and one in the middle), two in the middle points of each quadrant of the curved base (rotated 45 degrees), and two more on each side of the bordure, over the flag&#x27;s horizontal middle line. Each castle is composed by a base building, showing a closed (yellow) gate, on top of which stand three battlemented towers. In heraldic terminology, the shield&#x27;s blazon is described as &quot;Argent, five escutcheons in cross azure each charged with five plates in saltire, on a bordure gules seven towers triple-turreted Or, three in chief&quot;.

The colour tones of the flag are not precisely specified in any legal document. Recommendations are listed below:
===Background===

The Republican revolution of 5 October 1910, brought a need to replace the symbols of the overthrown monarchy, represented in the first instance by the old national flag and anthem. The choice of the new flag was not one without conflict, especially over the colours, as partisans of the republican red-and-green faced opposition from supporters of the traditional royal blue-and-white. Blue also carried a strong religious meaning as it was the colour of Our Lady of the Conception (), who was crowned Queen and Patroness of Portugal by King John IV, so its removal or replacement from the future flag was justified by Republicans as one of the many measures needed to secularize the state.

After the presentation and discussion of the many proposals, a governmental commission was set up on 15 October 1910. It included Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (painter), João Chagas (journalist), Abel Botelho (writer) and two military leaders of 1910: Ladislau Pereira and Afonso Palla. This commission ultimately chose the red-and-green of the Portuguese Republican Party, delivering an explanation based on patriotic reasons, which disguised the political significance behind the choice, as these had been the colours present on the banners of the rebellious during the republican insurrection of 31 January 1891, in Porto, and during the monarchy-overthrowing revolution, in Lisbon.
The commission considered that red should &quot;be present as one of the main colours, because it is the battling, warm, virile colour, par excellence. It is the colour of conquest and laughter. A singing, burning, joyful colour ... Recalls the idea of blood and urges to achieve victory&quot;. An explanation for the inclusion of the green was harder to come up with, given that it was not a traditional colour of the Portuguese flag&#x27;s history. Eventually, it was justified on the grounds that, during the 1891 insurrection, this was the colour present on the revolutionary flag that &quot;sparked the redeeming lightning&quot; of republicanism. Finally, white (on the shield) represented &quot;a beautiful and fraternal colour, into which all other colours merge themselves, colour of simplicity, of harmony and peace&quot;, adding that &quot;it is this same colour that, charged with enthusiasm and faith by the red cross of Christ, marks the Discoveries epic cycle&quot;.

The Manueline armillary sphere, which had been present on the national flag under the reign of John VI, was revived because it consecrated the &quot;Portuguese epic maritime history ... the ultimate challenge, essential to our collective life.&quot; The Portuguese shield was kept, being positioned over the armillary sphere. Its presence would immortalize the &quot;human miracle of positive bravery, tenacity, diplomacy, and audacity, that managed to bind the first links of the Portuguese nation&#x27;s social and political affirmation&quot;, since it is one of the &quot;most vigorous symbols of the national identity and integrity&quot;.

The new flag was produced in large numbers at the (&quot;National Rope House&quot;) and was officially presented nationwide on 1 December 1910, on occasion of the 270 years of the Restoration of Independence. This day had already been declared by the government as the &quot;Flag Day&quot; (currently not celebrated). In the capital, it was paraded from the city hall to the (&quot;Restorers&quot;) Monument, where it was hoisted. This festive presentation did not mask, however, the turmoil caused by a design chosen single-handedly without prior popular consultation, and that represented more of a political regime than a whole nation. To encourage a greater acceptance of the new flag, the government issued all teaching establishments with one exemplar, whose symbols were to be explained to the students; textbooks were changed to intensively display these symbols. Also, 1 December (&quot;Flag Day&quot;), 31 January and 5 October were declared national holidays.

==Symbolism==
The Portuguese flag displays three important symbols: the field colours, and the armillary sphere and national shield, which make up the coat of arms.

===Colours===

Despite the fact that the colours of red and green had never constituted a major part of the national flag until 1910, they were present in several historical banners during important periods. King John I included a green Aviz cross on the red bordure of his banner. The red cross of the Order of Christ was used over a white field as a naval pennon during the Discoveries and frequently on ship sails. A green background version was a popular standard of the rebellious during the 1640 revolution that restored Portugal&#x27;s independence from Spain. There are no registered sources to confirm that this was the origin of the republican colours. Another explanation gives full credit to the flag that was hoisted on the balcony of Porto&#x27;s city hall during the 1891 insurrection. It consisted of a red field bearing a green disc and the inscription &quot;Centro Democrático Federal «15 de Novembro»&quot; (&quot;15 November&quot; Federal Democratic Centre), representing one of many masonry-inspired republican clubs. Over the following 20 years, the red-and-green was present on every republican item in Portugal. The 1891 flag-inherited red stands for the colour of the republican-inspired masonry-backed revolutionaries, whereas green was the colour Auguste Comte had destined to be present in the flags of positivist nations, an ideal incorporated into the republican political matrix. Green was also added in order to distinguish the flag from the old royal standard, which had a background of solid red.

===Coat of arms===

====Escutcheon====

The Portuguese shield rests over the armillary sphere. Except during the reign of Afonso I, it is present in every single historical flag, in one form or another. It is the prime Portuguese symbol as well as one of the oldest, with the first elements of today&#x27;s shield appearing during the reign of Sancho I. The evolution of the Portuguese flag is inherently associated with the evolution of the shield.

Within the white inescutcheon, the five small blue shields with their five white bezants representing the five wounds of Christ () when crucified and are popularly associated with the &quot;Miracle of Ourique&quot;. The story associated with this miracle tells that before the Battle of Ourique on 25 July 1139, an old hermit appeared before Count Afonso Henriques (future Afonso I) as a divine messenger. He foretold Afonso&#x27;s victory and assured him that God was watching over him and his peers. The messenger advised him to walk away from his camp, alone, if he heard a nearby chapel bell tolling, in the following night. In doing so, he witnessed an apparition of Jesus on the cross. Ecstatic, Afonso heard Jesus promising victories for the coming battles, as well as God&#x27;s wish to act through Afonso, and his descendants, in order to create an empire which would carry his name to unknown lands, thus choosing the Portuguese to perform great tasks.
Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won the battle against an outnumbering enemy. Legend has it that Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in gratitude to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ&#x27;s five wounds in the form of silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot&#x27;s thirty pieces of silver.

However, evidence pointing out that the number of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I&#x27;s reign, as well as the fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), support this explanation as one of pure myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.

The seven castles are traditionally considered a symbol of the Portuguese victories over their Moorish enemies, under Afonso III, who supposedly captured seven enemy fortresses in the course of his conquest of the Algarve, concluded in 1249. However, this explanation is weakly founded since this king did not have seven castles on his banner, but an unspecified number. Some reconstructions display about sixteen castles; this number changed to twelve in 1385, to seven in 1485 and to eleven in 1495; it then changed back to seven, in 1578, this time definitively. An hypothesis about the origin of the castles on a red bordure lies in the family ties of Afonso III with Castile (both his mother and second wife were Castilian), whose arms consisted of a golden castle on a red field.

A variant of the Portuguese shield is found in the flag of Ceuta, a Spanish city on the North African coast, and is used as the city&#x27;s coat of arms, in a nod to its former history as a Portuguese possession.

====Supporter: Armillary sphere====

The armillary sphere was an important astronomical and navigational instrument for the Portuguese sailors who ventured into unknown seas during the Age of Discoveries. It was introduced by the Knights Templar, whose knowledge was essential to the Portuguese Discoveries—Henry, the Navigator, the person mainly responsible for the development of Age of Discovery was actually the Grand Master of the Order of Christ. It thus became the symbol of the most important period of the nation—the Portuguese discoveries. In light of this, King Manuel I, who ruled during this period, incorporated the armillary sphere into his personal banner. It was simultaneously used as the ensign of ships plying the route between the metropolis and Brazil, thus becoming a colonial symbol and a key element of the flags of the future Brazilian kingdom and empire.

Adding to the sphere&#x27;s significance was its common use on every Manueline-influenced architectural work, where it is one of the major stylistic elements, as seen on the Jerónimos Monastery and Belém Tower.
==Evolution==

Since the foundation of the kingdom, the banner of arms, i.e. the flag form of the royal arms, have served as national flag. In fact, until the 19th century, the flag served as a mere support to display the Royal coat of arms, without having any separate meaning. Until the 16th century, the flag consisted in a banner of arms, with its field being totally occupied by the field of the coat of arms, then it came to include the complete coat of arms, including the crown and other external elements laid over a monochrome white field. The flag only acquired a meaning by its own in 1830, when its field was changed from the neutral white to the distinctive blue and white, which were the national colours at that time. Although representing the country since its early beginnings, the flag of Portugal had a limited use until the 19th century, essentially being used as a fortress flag and as naval ensign, with some other flags also existing to represent the nation in other contexts, namely at the sea. In the 19th century, the flag of Portugal started to have a universal use, becoming a real national flag. It evolved in a way that gradually incorporated most of the symbols present on the current coat of arms.

===1095–1248===

The first heraldic symbol that can be associated with what would become the Portuguese nation was on the shield used by Henry of Burgundy, Count of Portugal since 1095, during his battles with the Moors. This shield consisted of a blue cross over a white field. Nevertheless, this design has no reliable sources since it is a reconstruction that became popular and widely accepted thanks to the nationalistic purposes of the Estado Novo regime.

Henry&#x27;s son Afonso Henriques succeeded him in the county and took on the same shield. In 1139, despite being outnumbered, he defeated an army of Almoravid Moors at the Battle of Ourique and proclaimed himself Afonso I, King of Portugal, in front of his troops. Following the official recognition by the neighbouring León, Afonso changed his shield in order to reflect his new political status. Sources state he charged the cross with five sets of an unspecified number of silver bezants (most likely large-headed silver nails), one set on the centre and one on each arm, symbolizing Afonso&#x27;s newly gained right to issue currency.

During the time of Afonso I, it was typical not to repair battle damage inflicted on the shield, so changes such as the breaking off of pieces, colour shifting or stains were very common. When Sancho I succeeded his father Afonso I, in 1185, he inherited a very worn off shield: the blue-stained leather that made the cross had been lost except where the bezants (nails) held it in place. This involuntary degradation was the basis for the next step on the evolution of the national coat of arms, where a plain blue cross transformed into a compound cross of five blue bezant-charged escutcheons—the &quot;quina&quot; (Portuguese word meaning &quot;group of five&quot;) were thus born. Sancho&#x27;s personal shield (called &quot;Portugal ancien&quot;) consisted of a white field with a compound cross of five shields (each one charged with eleven silver bezants) with the bottom edges of the lateral ones facing towards the centre. Both Sancho&#x27;s son Afonso II and grandson Sancho II used these arms, as it was usual with direct succession lines (cadency system). A new modification of the royal arms was made when Sancho II&#x27;s younger brother became king, in 1248.

===1248–1495===
Afonso III of Portugal was not the eldest son, therefore heraldic practices stated he should not take his father&#x27;s arms without adding a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to Matilda II of Boulogne but her inability to provide him with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. It is more likely that it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering that the number of castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.

The inner portion contained the arms of Sancho I, although the number of bezants varied between seven, eleven and sixteen (the latter number was used on Afonso&#x27;s personal standard while he was still Count of Boulogne). This same design was used by the Portuguese kings until the end of the first dynasty, in 1383; a succession crisis put the country at war with Castile and left it without a ruler for two years.

In 1385, in the wake of the Battle of Aljubarrota, a second dynasty was founded when John, Master of the Order of Aviz and illegitimate son of King Peter I, acceded to the throne as John I. To his personal banner, John I added his Order&#x27;s fleur-de-lys cross, displayed as green flowery points on the red bordure; this inclusion reduced the number of castles to twelve (three around each corner). The number of bezants in each escutcheon was reduced from eleven to seven. This banner lasted a hundred years until John I&#x27;s great-grandson John II restyled it, in 1485, introducing important changes: the removal of the Aviz cross, a downward arrangement and edge-smoothing of the shields, and the definitive fixing of five saltire-arranged bezants in each shield (summing up six &quot;quinas&quot;, i.e., six &quot;groups of five&quot;: one &quot;quina&quot; of shields and five &quot;quinas&quot; of bezants) and seven castles on the bordure (as it is currently). John II&#x27;s banner was the last armorial square banner used as the &quot;national&quot; flag or standard. Following his death, in 1495, radical changes were made by his successor.

===1495–1667===

John II was succeeded by his first cousin Manuel I, in 1495. This king was the first to convert the traditional square armorial banner into a rectangular (2:3) field with the coat of arms on its centre. Specifically, the flag was now a white rectangle centrally charged with the coat of arms (bearing eleven castles) on an ogival or heater-shaped shield and surmounted by an open royal crown. Manuel I possessed a personal standard which included the armillary sphere for the first time.

In 1521, John III made minor changes to the flag by adopting a coat of arms (bearing only seven castles) with a round shaped shield.

In 1578, during the reign of Sebastian and on the eve of the fatal Battle of Alcácer Quibir, the flag was again modified. The number of castles was permanently fixed at seven and the royal crown was converted into a closed three-arched crown, which symbolized a stronger royal authority. With Sebastian&#x27;s death and the short-lived reign of his great-uncle Cardinal Henry, in 1580, a dynastic crisis was solved with the Spanish king Philip II acceding to the Portuguese throne as Philip I, installing a Spanish dynasty. The accession was made on the condition that Portugal was ruled as a separate, autonomous state, not as a province. This was fulfilled as Portugal and Spain formed a personal union under Philip I and his successors. A consequence of this administrative situation was the maintenance of the flag created under Sebastian&#x27;s reign as the Portuguese national flag, while Spain had its own. As the ruling house in Portugal, the Habsburg banner also included the Portuguese arms.

The country regained its independence from Spain, in 1640, in a coup d&#x27;état that placed on the throne John, Duke of Bragança, as King John IV. Under his rule, the national flag was slightly changed as the ogival shield became rounded. It was from this reign forward that the royal arms and the kingdom&#x27;s arms became separate banners.

===1667–1830===

When Afonso VI&#x27;s younger brother Peter II replaced him on the throne, in 1667, he adapted the flag&#x27;s crown to fit the contemporary trends by transforming it into a five-arched crown. The new flag did not remain unchanged for too long, as it was refurbished by Peter&#x27;s son John V, after he took the throne, in 1707. Heavily influenced by the luxurious and ostentatious court of the French king Louis XIV, and by France&#x27;s political and cultural impact in Europe, John V wanted to transpose such style into the country&#x27;s coat of arms. A red beret was then added under the crown. Besides the change of the crown, the shields started to be represented, on the flags, not only in the traditional round bottom shape (&quot;Iberian type&quot;), but also in other formats like the samnitic (&quot;French type&quot;), the horsehead (&quot;Italian type&quot;) or the oval (&quot;cartouche&quot;) shapes. Instated by an absolute monarch like John V, this flag endured through almost the entire absolutist period in Portugal—John V (1707–1750), Joseph I (1750–1777) and Maria I (1777–1816).

During the second half of the 17th century, the maritime use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned the use of this flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a complement of 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.

With the invasion of Portugal by Napoleon&#x27;s imperial army in 1807, the Portuguese Royal Court fled to Brazil, establishing the capital of the Portuguese Monarchy and Empire in Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the Portuguese state of Brazil was elevated to a kingdom, thus receiving the same status as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves. The whole of the Portuguese Monarchy became then the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. To reflect the change of the status of the Portuguese Monarchy, the Prince Regent John (future King João VI, at that time still reigning in name of his mother, Queen Mary I) established a new Royal coat of arms, where the Portuguese shield (representing Portugal and the Algarves) charged a blue-filled yellow armillary sphere (representing Brazil) surmounted by the same beret-bearing five-arched crown. The new coat of arms replaced the previous one in the Portuguese flags.

Despite the end of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, when Brazil became independent in 1822, its coat of arms continued to be used, inclusive in flags, until the death of João VI in 1826. From then on, the previous coat of arms, without the armillary sphere, became in use again.

===1830–1910===
João VI died in Lisbon in 1826. His elder son Peter, who had declared the independence of Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Pedro I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Pedro IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only seven years old, so Pedro stated she would marry his brother Miguel who would act as regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started the period of the Liberal Wars.

The liberals formed a separate government exiled on the Azorean island of Terceira. This government issued two decrees establishing modifications to the national flag. While supporters of usurper King Miguel I still upheld the flag established by João VI, the liberal supporters imposed important changes on it. The background was equally divided along its length into blue (hoist) and white (fly); the armillary sphere (associated with Brazil) was removed and the coat of arms was centred over the colour boundary; and the shield reverted to the &quot;French type&quot; shape of João V. This new flag configuration was decreed solely for terrestrial use, but a variation of it was used as the national ensign. This ensign differed in the way the colours occupied the background (blue , white ) with a consequent positional shift of the arms.

With the defeat and exile of Miguel in 1834, Queen Maria II returned to the throne and the standard of the victorious side was hoisted in Lisbon as the new national flag. It was in use for 80 years, witnessing the last period of the Portuguese monarchy until its abolition in 1910. Currently this flag is used by Portuguese monarchists. The Independence Day parade of Brazil also presented this flag in the standard marchpast, along with other historical flags of Portugal and Brazil.

==Flag protocol==

===Use===

The Portuguese legislation concerning the use of the National Flag is mostly limited to the Decree-law 150/87, issued on 30 March 1987, which replaced the previous scarce legislation dated back to the beginning of the 20th century.

The Decree-law 150/87 states that the flag is to be hoisted from 9:00 a.m. to sunset (during the night, it must be properly lit), on Sundays and national holidays, throughout the entire national territory. It can also be displayed on days where official ceremonies or other solemn public sessions are held; in this case, the flag is hoisted on-site. The flag can be hoisted on other days if it is considered appropriate by the central government, or by other regional or local governing bodies, or by heads of private institutions. It must follow the official design standard and be preserved in good condition.

The headquarters buildings of the bodies of sovereignty, the flag can stay hoisted on a daily basis. It can also be hoisted on civilian and military national monuments; on public buildings associated with the central, regional or local administration; and on headquarters of public corporations and institutions. Citizens and private institutions can also display it, on the condition that they respect the relevant legal procedures. At the facilities of nationally based international organizations or in the case of international meetings, the flag is hoisted according to the protocol used on those situations.

If national mourning is declared, the flag will be flown at half-staff during the fixed number of days; any flag hoisted along with it will be flown in the same manner.

When unfurled in the presence of other flags, the national flag must not have smaller dimensions and must be situated in a prominent, honourable place, according to the relevant protocol.

If there are more than one flagpole, the National Flag should be flown:
* Two flagpoles – on the right pole viewed by a person facing the exterior;
* Three flagpoles – on the central pole;
* More than three flagpoles:
** Within a building – if an odd number of poles, on the central pole; if an even number, on the first pole on the right of the centre;
** Outside a building – always on the rightmost pole;

If the flagpoles do not have the same height, the flag must be flown on the highest pole. The poles should be placed in honourable locations of the ground, building façades and roofs. On public acts where the flag is not hoisted, it can be suspended from a distinct spot, but never used as decoration, covering or for any purpose that can diminish its dignity.

===Penalties===
An early decree, from 28 December 1910, established that &quot;any person who, through speech, published writings or any other public act, shows lack of respect to the national flag, which is the fatherland&#x27;s symbol, will be sentenced to a three to twelve-month prison term with corresponding fine and, in case of relapse, will be sentenced to exile, as stated in the 62nd article of the Penal Code&quot;.
In its 332nd article, the current penal code punishes infractions with a prison sentence of up to two years. If the sentence is shorter than 240 days, there is a formula for converting it into a fine. If the offense is directed towards regional symbols, the penalties are halved.

===Folding===
During formal occasions, four people are required to properly fold the flag, where each person holds one of the sides. A correctly folded flag must be a square limiting the national shield. However, the order by which the different folding steps are performed to achieve this result is not legislated.

The procedure begins with the flag fully extended and held in a horizontal plane with the obverse facing down. One of the possible folding sequences is demonstrated below:
==Military flags==
The National Flag of Portugal also serves as war flag and ensign, so being flown on military facilities and naval ships. There are however specific national military flags for specific uses, namely the military colours, the naval jack and the naval pennant. The military colours are occasionally referred as war flag, however they are not to be flown on military facilities but are only to be carried by the military units on parades.

===National colours===

The national colours constitute the portable variants of the National Flag for use on parades by the military units. In the past, the colours had a practical function, being used as a signal to guide the military units in battle. Originally, the colours were referred as &quot;regimental flags&quot; (&quot;bandeiras regimentais&quot;) or &quot;military units flags&quot; (&quot;bandeiras das unidades militares&quot;), but now they are referred as &quot;national standards&quot; (&quot;estandartes nacionais&quot;). The colours are always carried in parade by a junior officer, escorted by a colour guard.

The standard model of the colours – also adopted in 1911 – is a rectangular flag measuring in width and in length (ratio 12:13). Green and red are positioned at the hoist and fly, respectively, but occupy the field in an equal manner (1:1). Centred over the colour boundary lie the armillary sphere and Portuguese shield, surrounded by two yellow laurel branches intersecting at their stems. These are bound by a white stripe bearing the verse by Luís de Camões &quot;Esta é a ditosa pátria minha amada&quot; () as the motto. This differs from the version of coat of arms employed as emblem, where the laurel shoots are tied by a green and red stripe without the verse. The sphere&#x27;s outer diameter is one-third of the width and lies from the upper edge and from the lower edge.

Although the 1911 regulation is, theoretically, still in force, the various branches of the Armed Forces made specific changes to it and so, several types of colours are used by the different military units. For example, the colours adopted by the Portuguese Army, in 1979, measures just .

===Naval jack===
The Portuguese naval jack (&quot;jaco&quot; or &quot;jaque&quot;) is only hoisted at the prow of docked or anchored Navy ships, from sunrise to sunset. The national flag is permanently hoisted at the stern, when sailing, and from sunrise to sunset, when docked. It is a square flag (ratio 1:1) bearing a green-bordered red field with the minor coat of arms on the centre. The width of the green border and the diameter of the armillary sphere are equal to and of the side&#x27;s dimension, respectively.

===Commissioning pennant===
The Portuguese commissioning pennant (&quot;flâmula&quot;) is a long triangular flag, green on the hoist and red on the fly. It is to be flown on the main mast of the naval ships commanded by officers.

==Government flags==
Highly ranked state and governmental offices are also represented by their own flags. The President of the Republic () uses a flag largely similar to the national flag, except for having dark green as the only background colour. It is usually hoisted at the President&#x27;s official residence, the Palace of Belém, as well as on the presidential car, as small-sized flags. The flag of the Prime-Minister is a white rectangle (ratio 2:3) with a dark green saltire, holding the lesser coat of arms on its centre, and a red bordure charged with a pattern of yellow laurel leaves. Other ministerial flags do not possess the red bordure. The flag of the Assembly of the Republic (), the national parliament, is also a white rectangle (ratio 2:3) with the lesser coat of arms in the centre and a dark green border.
