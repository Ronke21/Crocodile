<text>The Tenth United States Army was the last army level command established during the Pacific War during World War II, and included divisions from both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps.

==History==
The headquarters of the Tenth Army was formed in June 1944 at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii with the original intent of being the headquarters element for the land forces of the planned invasion of Taiwan (then known as Formosa). Following a conference at Pearl Harbor in July between President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz and General Douglas MacArthur, it was decided to invade the Philippines instead of Taiwan. As a result, the Tenth Army did not have an operational assignment until the invasion of Okinawa in April 1945.

===Commanders===
The Tenth Army was commanded by Lieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. from its activation on 20 June 1944 until he was killed by enemy artillery fire on Okinawa on 18 June 1945. Major General Roy Geiger, USMC assumed temporary command, becoming the first Marine Corps general to ever command a field army, and led the Tenth Army until relieved by General Joseph Stilwell on 23 June. Stilwell commanded the Tenth Army until it was disbanded on 15 October 1945.

===Battle of Okinawa===
During the Battle of Okinawa (1 April through 22 June 1945), the Tenth Army consisted of XXIV Corps of the U.S. Army (consisting of the 7th, 27th, 77th and 96th Army infantry divisions) and III Amphibious Corps of the U.S. Marine Corps (consisting of the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine divisions). The Tenth Army was unique among field armies in that it had its own Tactical Air Force, Tenth Army, a joint Army-Marine formation.

The Army had over 102,000 soldiers (of these 38,000+ were non-divisional artillery, combat support and HQ troops, with another 9,000 service troops), over 88,000 Marines and 18,000 Navy personnel (mostly Seabee and medical personnel). At the start of Battle of Okinawa, Tenth Army had 182,821 men under its command.

In all, Tenth Army suffered 65,631 casualties during the campaign, with 34,736 being suffered by XXIV Corps, 26,724 by III Amphibious Corps, 520 to the tactical air force attached to Tenth Army, 2,636 to the Army garrison forces of Okinawa and Ie Shima, and 1,015 to troops directly under the command of Tenth Army. As noted earlier, one of those casualties was the commander of the Tenth Army himself, killed by an enemy shell burst while visiting a forward position. The day after, a second general, Brigadier General Claudius M. Easley, was killed by machine gun fire. General Joseph Stilwell was selected to succeed General Buckner as commander of the Tenth Army.

Okinawa turned out to be the only campaign that Tenth Army would take part in during World War II. It was earmarked to take part in Operation Coronet, the second phase of the invasion of Japan, but the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and subsequent Japanese surrender, obviated the need to invade Japan. The Tenth Army was disbanded on 15 October 1945.

<doc id="454476" wikidata="Q679653" url="?curid=454476" title="2001 Australian federal election">
<text>&lt;section begin=&quot;Aus infobox&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;Aus infobox&quot; /&gt;

The 2001 Australian federal election was held in Australia on 10 November 2001. All 150 seats in the House of Representatives and 40 seats in the 76-member Senate were up for election. The incumbent Liberal Party of Australia led by Prime Minister of Australia John Howard and coalition partner the National Party of Australia led by John Anderson defeated the opposition Australian Labor Party led by Kim Beazley. As of 2024, this was the most recent election to feature a rematch of both major party leaders. Future Opposition Leader Peter Dutton entered parliament at this election.

==Background==

Throughout much of 2001, the Coalition had been trailing Labor in opinion polls, thanks to dissatisfaction with the government&#x27;s economic reform programme and high petrol prices. The opposition Australian Labor Party had won a majority of the two-party-preferred vote at the previous election and had won a series of state and territory elections. Labor also recorded positive swings in two by-elections, taking the Queensland seat of Ryan and coming close in Aston.

However following the September 11 attacks, and the Children Overboard and Tampa affairs, Polls swung strongly toward the coalition after the &quot;Tampa&quot; controversy but before the 11 September attacks.

In fact, voter concern with terrorism in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the United States was noted, with the rise in the combined primary votes of the major parties
from 79.61% at the previous election in 1998, to 81.17% at this election. There would be further increases in the combined major party primary vote in 2004 and 2007.

Another major issue was the collapse of the country&#x27;s second-biggest airline Ansett Australia and the question of whether it should be given a bailout. The Coalition was opposed to any bailout because the collapse was not the government&#x27;s fault. However, Labor supported a bailout, because the company&#x27;s collapse was about to result in the biggest mass job loss in Australian history, whilst also arguing that the government was partially responsible for allowing Ansett to be taken over by Air New Zealand, a move which had caused Ansett&#x27;s failure. Although the two-party preferred result was reasonably close, the ALP recorded its lowest primary vote since 1934.

During the 2001 election campaign, Labor made a &#x27;GST rollback&#x27; a centrepiece of its election platform. Labor attempted to reprise the effects of the birthday cake interview by deriding the application of GST to cooked and uncooked chickens, but failed to ignite public response to the limited scope of the rollbacks applying only to gas and electricity bills. the election loss of Labor in 2001, would effectively end all serious opposition to GST.

Political scientists have suggested that television coverage has subtly transformed the political system, with a spotlight on leaders rather than parties, thereby making for more of an American presidential-style system. In this election, television news focused on international issues, especially terrorism and asylum seekers. Minor parties were largely ignored as the two main parties monopolised the media&#x27;s attention. The election was depicted as a horse-race between Howard and Beazley, with Howard running ahead and therefore being given more coverage than his Labor rival.

The election-eve Newspoll forecast that the Liberal/National Coalition would get 53 percent of the two-party-preferred vote.

==Results==
===House of Representatives results===




===Senate results===

==House of Representatives preference flows==

* The Nationals had candidates in 14 seats where three-cornered-contests existed, with 87.34% of preferences favouring the Liberal Party.
* The Democrats contested 145 electorates with preferences favouring Labor (64.13%).
* The Greens contested 145 electorates with preferences strongly favouring Labor (74.83%).
* One Nation contested 120 electorates with preferences slightly favouring the Liberal/National Coalition (55.87%).

==Seats changing hands==

The following table indicates seats that changed hands from one party to another at this election. It compares the election results with the previous margins, taking into account redistributions in New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and both territories. As a result, it includes the seats of Macarthur and Parramatta, which were held by Liberal members but had notional Labor margins. The table also includes the new seat of Hasluck (retained by Labor); the abolished Northern Territory, which was divided into Lingiari (retained by Labor) and Solomon (retained by the CLP); and Paterson, a Labor seat made Liberal by the redistribution

<text>The East Coast Railway (abbreviated ECoR) is one of the 19 railway zones of Indian Railways. It came into existence on 1 April 2003. It headquarters are located at .

==History==
Consequent upon the parliament&#x27;s approval, East Coast Railway was the first of the seven new zones to be inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India H. D. Deve Gowda on 8 August 1996. The Officer-on-Special Duty took charge of the newly declared Zone on 16 September 1996. Initially, only one division namely Khurda Road was attached to this railway.

The zone became fully operational on 1 April 2003. The Waltair division was notified to be bifurcated from the East Coast Railway zone on 27 February 2019. The Odisha section of Waltair division will constitute the new Rayagada division, while the Andhra Pradesh section will be a part of the South Coast Railway zone upon operationalization.

==Divisions==
The geographical jurisdiction of East Coast Railway zone extends over three states encompassing almost all of Odisha and Bastar, Mahasamund and Dantewada districts of Chhattisgarh and a minor part Palasa, Sompeta and seven other stations of Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh. The zonal headquarters is at Bhubaneswar in Odisha.

The zone has three divisions: Sambalpur, Khurda and Rayagada.

The Rayagada railway division was proposed to succeed a section of the former Waltair division which will remain in the East Coast Railway zone upon bifurcation. The foundation stone for the zone was laid on 6 January 2025, with the demarcation of the zone finalised on 7 February 2025.

==Electrification==
As of 31 December 2021, it is one of the three 100% electric railway zones in India. The East Coast Railway line integrated with the commissioned Howrah-Chennai electrified trunk route on 29 November 2005. There was a missing link between Kharagpur and Visakhapatnam stations and all trains from Howrah towards Chennai side had to undergo a locomotive change from electric to diesel at Kharagpur and vice versa at Visakhapatnam in order to pass through Odisha. Even trains from New Delhi such as the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani had to undergo the change at Kharagpur. This frequent loco change on a trunk route became a time-consuming and inconvenient process. With electrification along the 765 km Kharagpur-Visakhapatnam stretch, trains got speeded up and the need for double headed diesels for high speed express trains was eliminated thus saving on diesel consumption and a cleaner travel. Additionally the line branching off Khurda road towards Puri was also electrified. Gradually the Cuttack-Angul line, Cuttack-Paradeep line and branch line from Jakhapura towards Barbil got electrified too.

== Major railway stations ==
The major railway stations in the entire zone are Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Chatrapur, Puri, Sambalpur, Khurda Road, Balugaon, Rayagada, Brahmapur, Angul, Dhenkanal, Bhadrak, Balangir, Bargarh, Jajpur Keonjhar Road, Titilagarh, Kesinga, Lanjigarh, Koraput, Mahasamund, Jagdalpur, Kendujhargarh, Palasa and Barbil.

Most of the major stations fall in the state of Odisha, Chhattisgarh.

<text>Windows 9x is a generic term referring to a line of discontinued Microsoft Windows operating systems from 1995 to 2000, which were based on the Windows 95 kernel and its underlying foundation of MS-DOS, both of which were updated in subsequent versions. The first version in the 9x series was Windows 95, which was succeeded by Windows 98 and then Windows Me, which was the third and last version of Windows on the 9x line, until the series was superseded by Windows XP.

Windows 9x is predominantly known for its use in home desktops. In 1998, Windows made up 82% of operating system market share.

The internal release number for versions of Windows 9x is 4.x. The internal versions for Windows 95, 98, and Me are 4.0, 4.1, and 4.9, respectively. Previous MS-DOS-based versions of Windows used version numbers of 3.2 or lower. Windows NT, which was aimed at professional users such as networks and businesses, used a similar but separate version number between 3.1 and 4.0. All versions of Windows from Windows XP onwards are based on the Windows NT codebase.

==History==
===Windows prior to 95===
The first independent version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released on November 20, 1985, achieved little popularity. Its name was initially &quot;Interface Manager&quot;, but Rowland Hanson, the head of marketing at Microsoft, convinced the company that the name &quot;Windows&quot; would be more appealing to consumers. Windows 1.0 was not a complete operating system, but rather an &quot;operating environment&quot; that extended MS-DOS. Consequently, it shared the inherent flaws and problems of MS-DOS.

The second installment of Microsoft Windows, version 2.0, was released on December 9, 1987, and used the real-mode memory model, which confined it to a maximum of 1 megabyte of memory. In such a configuration, it could run under another multitasking system like DESQview, which used the 286 Protected Mode.

Microsoft Windows scored a significant success with Windows 3.0, released in 1990. In addition to improved capabilities given to native applications, Windows also allowed users to better multitask older MS-DOS-based software compared to Windows/386, thanks to the introduction of virtual memory.

Microsoft developed Windows 3.1, which included several minor improvements to Windows 3.0, primarily consisting of bugfixes and multimedia support. It also excluded support for Real mode, and only ran on an Intel 80286 or better processor. Windows 3.1 was released on April 6, 1992. In November 1993 Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in early 1992.

Meanwhile, Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was Dave Cutler, one of the chief architects of VMS at Digital Equipment Corporation. Microsoft hired him in August 1988 to create a successor to OS/2, but Cutler created a completely new system instead based on his MICA project at Digital. The first version of Windows NT, Windows NT 3.1, would be released on July 27, 1993 and used Windows 3.1&#x27;s interface.

About a year before the development of Windows 3.1&#x27;s successor (Windows 95, code-named Chicago) began, Microsoft announced at its 1991 Professional Developers Conference that they would be developing a successor to Windows NT code-named Cairo, which some viewed it as succeeding both Windows NT and Windows 3.1&#x27;s successor under one unified system. Microsoft publicly demonstrated Cairo at the 1993 Professional Developers Conference, complete with a demo system running Cairo for all attendees to use.

Based on the Windows NT kernel, Cairo was a next-generation operating system that was to feature as many new technologies into Windows, including a new user interface with an object-based file system (this new user interface would officially debut with Windows 95 nearly 4 years later while the object-based file system would later be adopted as WinFS during the development of Windows Vista). According to Microsoft&#x27;s product plan at the time, Cairo was planned to be released as late as July 1996 following its development.

However, it had become apparent that Cairo was a much more difficult project than Microsoft had anticipated, and the project was subsequently cancelled 5 years into development. A subset of features from Cairo were eventually added into Windows NT 4.0 released on August 24, 1996, albeit without the object file system. Windows NT and Windows 9x would not be truly unified until Windows XP nearly 5 years later, when Microsoft began to merge its consumer and business line of Windows under a singular brand name based on Windows NT.

===Windows 95===
After Windows 3.11, Microsoft began to develop a new consumer oriented version of the operating system code-named Chicago. Chicago was designed to have support for 32-bit preemptive multitasking, that of which was available in OS/2 and Windows NT, although a 16-bit kernel would remain for the sake of backward compatibility. The Win32 API first introduced with Windows NT was adopted as the standard 32-bit programming interface, with Win16 compatibility being preserved through a technique known as &quot;thunking&quot;. A new GUI was not originally planned as part of the release, although elements of the Cairo user interface were borrowed and added as other aspects of the release (notably Plug and Play) slipped (and indeed after Cairo was cancelled 5 years in development).

Microsoft did not change all of the Windows code to 32-bit; parts of it remained 16-bit (albeit not directly using real mode) for reasons of compatibility, performance and development time. Additionally it was necessary to carry over design decisions from earlier versions of Windows for reasons of backwards compatibility, even if these design decisions no longer matched a more modern computing environment. These factors immediately began to impact the operating system&#x27;s efficiency and stability.

Microsoft marketing adopted Windows 95 as the product name for Chicago when it was released on August 24, 1995.

Microsoft went on to release five different versions of Windows 95:
* Windows 95 – original release (RTM)
* Windows 95 A – included Windows 95 OSR1 slipstreamed into the installation.
* Windows 95 B – (OSR2) included several major enhancements, Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and full FAT32 file system support.
* Windows 95 B USB – (OSR2.1) included basic USB support.
* Windows 95 C – (OSR2.5) included all the above features, plus IE 4.0. This was the last 95 version produced.

OSR2, OSR2.1, and OSR2.5 (&quot;OSR&quot; being an initialism for &quot;OEM Service Release&quot;) were not released to the general public, rather, they were available only to OEMs that would preload the OS onto computers. Some companies sold new hard drives with OSR2 preinstalled (officially justifying this as needed due to the hard drive&#x27;s capacity).

The first Microsoft Plus! add-on pack was sold for Windows 95.

===Windows 98===
On June 25, 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, code-named &quot;Memphis&quot; during development. It included new hardware drivers and better support for the FAT32 file system which allows support for disk partitions larger than the 2 GB maximum accepted by Windows 95. The USB support in Windows 98 was more robust than the basic support provided by the OEM editions of Windows 95. It also introduces the controversial integration of the Internet Explorer 4 web browser into the Windows shell and File Explorer (then known as Windows Explorer at the time).

On June 10, 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition (also known as Windows 98 SE), an interim release whose notable features were the addition of Internet Connection Sharing and improved WDM audio and modem support. Internet Connection Sharing is a form of network address translation, allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single Internet connection. It also includes Internet Explorer 5 as opposed to Internet Explorer 4 in the original version. Windows 98 Second Edition also has certain improvements over the original release, and hardware support through device drivers was increased. Many minor problems present in the original release of Windows 98 were also found and fixed. These changes, among others, makes it (according to many) the most stable release of Windows 9x family—to the extent that some commentators used to say that Windows 98&#x27;s beta version was more stable than Windows 95&#x27;s final (gamma) version.

Like with Windows 95, Windows 98 received the Microsoft Plus! add-on in the form of Plus! 98.

===Windows Me===
On September 14, 2000, Microsoft introduced Windows Me (Millennium Edition; also known as Windows ME), which upgraded Windows 98 with enhanced multimedia and Internet features. Code-named &quot;Millennium&quot;, It was conceived as a quick one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP (then code-named Whistler at the time). It borrowed some features from the business-oriented Windows 2000 into the Windows 9x series, and introduced the first version of System Restore, which allowed users to revert their system state to a previous &quot;known-good&quot; point in the case of a system failure. Windows Me also introduced the first release of Windows Movie Maker and included Windows Media Player 7. Internet Explorer 5.5 came shipped with Windows Me. Many of the new features from Windows Me were also available as updates for older Windows versions such as Windows 98 via Windows Update. The role of MS-DOS has also been greatly reduced compared to previous versions of Windows, with Windows Me no longer allowing real mode DOS to be accessed.

Windows Me initially gained a positive reception upon its release, but later on it was heavily criticized by users for its instability and unreliability, due to frequent freezes and crashes. Windows Me has been viewed by many as one of the worst operating systems of all time, both in critical and in retrospect. &quot;PC World&quot; was highly critical of Windows Me months after it was released (and indeed when it was no longer available), with their article infamously describing Windows Me as &quot;Mistake Edition&quot; and placing it 4th in their &quot;Worst Tech Products of All Time&quot; feature in 2006. Consequently, many home users that were affected by Windows Me&#x27;s instabilities (as well as those who negatively viewed Windows Me) ultimately stuck with the more reliable Windows 98 Second Edition for the remainder of Windows Me&#x27;s lifecycle until the release of Windows XP in 2001. A small number of Windows Me owners moved over to the business-oriented Windows 2000 Professional during that same time period.

The inability of users to easily boot into real mode MS-DOS like in Windows 95 and 98 led users to quickly figure out how to hack their Windows Me installations to provide this missing functionality back into the operating system.

Windows Me never received a dedicated Microsoft Plus! add-on like with Windows 95 and Windows 98.

===Decline===
The release of Windows 2000 marked a shift in the user experience between the Windows 9x series and the Windows NT series. Windows NT 4.0, while based on the Windows 95 interface, suffered from a lack of support for USB, Plug and Play and DirectX versions after 3.0, preventing its users from playing contemporary games. Windows 2000 on the other hand, while primarily made towards business and server users, featured an updated user interface and better support for both Plug and Play and USB, as well as including built-in support for DirectX 7.0. The release of Windows XP in late 2001 confirmed the change of direction for Microsoft, bringing the consumer and business operating systems together under Windows NT.

After the release of Windows XP, Microsoft stopped selling Windows 9x releases to end users (and later to OEMs) in the early 2000s. By March 2004, it was impossible to purchase any versions of the Windows 9x series.

===End of support===

Over time, support for the Windows 9x series ended. Windows 95 lost its mainstream support on December 31, 2000, and extended support was dropped from Windows 95 on December 31, 2001 (which also ended support for older Windows versions prior to Windows 95 on that same day). Windows 98 and Windows 98 Second Edition had its mainstream support end on June 30, 2002, and mainstream support for Windows Me ended on December 31, 2003. Microsoft then continued to support the Windows 9x series until July 11, 2006, when extended support ended for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), and Windows Millennium Edition (Me) – 4 years after extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.

Microsoft DirectX, a set of standard gaming APIs, stopped being updated on Windows 95 at version 8.0a. It also stopped being updated on Windows 98 and Me after the release of Windows Vista in 2006, making DirectX 9.0c the last version of DirectX to support these operating systems.

Support for Microsoft Internet Explorer on all Windows 9x releases have also ended. Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me all lost security patches for Internet Explorer when the respective operating systems reached their end of support date. Internet Explorer 5.5 with Service Pack 2 is the last version of Internet Explorer compatible with Windows 95, while Internet Explorer 6 with Service Pack 1 is the last version compatible with latter releases of Windows 9x (i.e. 98 and Me). While Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP did receive security patches up until it lost support, this is not the case for IE6 under Windows 98 and Me. Due to its age, Internet Explorer 7, the first major update to Internet Explorer 6 in half a decade, was only available for Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista.

In 2011, Microsoft retired the Windows Update v4 website and removed the updates for Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Me from its servers. Despite this, an independent project named Windows Update Restored was created in 2022 that aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including all releases of Windows 9x.

Microsoft announced in July 2019 that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows Me (and XP) would end on July 31, 2019 (and for Windows 7 on January 22, 2020).

===Current usage===

The growing number of important updates caused by the end of life service for these operating systems have slowly made Windows 9x even less practical for everyday use. Today, even open source projects such as Mozilla Firefox will not run on Windows 9x without major rework.

RetroZilla is a fork of Gecko 1.8.1 aimed at bringing &quot;improved compatibility on the modern web&quot; for versions of Windows as old as Windows 95 and NT 4.0. The latest version, 2.2, was released in February 2019 and added support for TLS 1.2.

==Design==

===Kernel===
Windows 9x is a series of monolithic 16/32-bit operating systems.

Like most operating systems, Windows 9x consists of kernel space and user space memory. Although Windows 9x features some memory protection, it does not protect the first megabyte of memory from userland applications for compatibility reasons. This area of memory contains code critical to the functioning of the operating system, and by writing into this area of memory an application can crash or freeze the operating system. This was a source of instability as faulty applications could accidentally write into this region, potentially corrupting important operating system memory, which usually resulted in some form of system error and halt.

====User mode====
The user-mode parts of Windows 9x consist of three subsystems: the Win16 subsystem, the Win32 subsystem and MS-DOS.

Windows 9x/Me set aside two blocks of 64 KiB memory regions for GDI and heap resources. By running multiple applications, applications with numerous GDI elements or by running applications over a long span of time, it could exhaust these memory areas. If free system resources dropped below 10%, Windows would become unstable and likely crash.

====Kernel mode====
The kernel mode parts consist of the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), the Installable File System Manager (IFSHLP), the Configuration Manager, and in Windows 98 and later, the WDM Driver Manager (NTKERN).

As a 32-bit operating system, virtual memory space is 4 GiB, divided into a lower 2 GiB for applications and an upper 2 GiB for kernel per process.

===Registry===
Like Windows NT, Windows 9x stores user-specific and configuration-specific settings in a large information database called the Windows registry. Hardware-specific settings are also stored in the registry, and many device drivers use the registry to load configuration data. Previous versions of Windows used files such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 and other files with an codice_5 extension to maintain configuration settings. As Windows became more complex and incorporated more features, codice_5 files became too unwieldy for the limitations of the then-current FAT filesystem. Backwards-compatibility with codice_5 files was maintained until Windows XP succeeded the 9x and NT lines.

Although Microsoft discourages using .INI files in favor of Registry entries, a large number of applications (particularly 16-bit Windows-based applications) still use .INI files. Windows 9x supports .INI files solely for compatibility with those applications and related tools (such as setup programs). The AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files also still exist for compatibility with real-mode system components and to allow users to change certain default system settings such as the PATH environment variable.

The registry consists of two files: User.dat and System.dat. In Windows Me, Classes.dat was added.

===Virtual Machine Manager===
The Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) is the 32-bit protected mode kernel at the core of Windows 9x. Its primary responsibility is to create, run, monitor and terminate virtual machines.

The VMM provides services that manage memory, processes, interrupts and protection faults. The VMM works with virtual devices (loadable kernel modules, which consist mostly of 32-bit ring 0 or kernel mode code, but may include other types of code, such as a 16-bit real mode initialisation segment) to allow those virtual devices to intercept interrupts and faults to control the access that an application has to hardware devices and installed software. Both the VMM and virtual device drivers run in a single, 32-bit, flat model address space at privilege level 0 (also called ring 0). The VMM provides multi-threaded, preemptive multitasking. It runs multiple applications simultaneously by sharing CPU (central processing unit) time between the threads in which the applications and virtual machines run.

The VMM is also responsible for creating MS-DOS environments for system processes and Windows applications that still need to run in MS-DOS mode. It is the replacement for WIN386.EXE in Windows 3.x, and the file vmm32.vxd is a compressed archive containing most of the core VxD, including VMM.vxd itself and ifsmgr.vxd (which facilitates file system access without the need to call the real mode file system code of the DOS kernel).

===Software support===

==== Unicode ====
Partial support for Unicode can be installed on Windows 9x through the Microsoft Layer for Unicode.

====File systems====
Windows 9x does not natively support NTFS or HPFS; however, there are third-party solutions available for Windows 9x that allows read-only access to NTFS volumes. Early versions of Windows 95 did not support FAT32.

Like Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Windows 9x provides support for 32-bit file access based on IFSHLP.SYS. Unlike Windows 3.x, Windows 9x has support for the VFAT file system, allowing file names with a maximum of 255 characters instead of having 8.3 filenames.

====Event logging and tracing====
Windows 9x has no support for event logging and tracing or error reporting that the Windows NT family of operating systems has, although software like Norton CrashGuard can be used to achieve similar capabilities on Windows 9x.

====Security====
Windows 9x is designed as a single-user system. Thus, the security model is much less effective than the one in Windows NT. One reason for this is the FAT file systems (including FAT12/FAT16/FAT32), which are the only ones that Windows 9x supports officially, though Windows NT also supports FAT12 and FAT16 (but not FAT32; which wouldn’t be supported until Windows 2000) and Windows 9x can be extended to read and write NTFS volumes using third-party Installable File System drivers. FAT systems have very limited security; every user that has access to a FAT drive also has access to all files on that drive. The FAT file systems provide no access control lists and file-system level encryption like NTFS.

Some operating systems that were available at the same time as Windows 9x are either multi-user or have multiple user accounts with different access privileges, which allows important system files (such as the kernel image) to be immutable under most user accounts. In contrast, while Windows 95 and later operating systems offer the option of having profiles for multiple users, they have no concept of access privileges, making them roughly equivalent to a single-user, single-account operating system; this means that all processes can modify all files on the system that aren&#x27;t open, in addition to being able to modify the boot sector and perform other low-level hard drive modifications. This enables viruses and other clandestinely installed software to integrate themselves with the operating system in a way that is difficult for ordinary users to detect or undo. The profile support in the Windows 9x family is meant for convenience only; unless some registry keys are modified, the system can be accessed by pressing &quot;Cancel&quot; at login, even if all profiles have a password. Windows 95&#x27;s default login dialog box also allows new user profiles to be created without having to log in first.

Users and software can render the operating system unable to function by deleting or overwriting important system files from the hard disk. Users and software are also free to change configuration files in such a way that the operating system is unable to boot or properly function. This phenomenon is not exclusive to Windows 9x; many other operating systems are also susceptible to these vulnerabilities, either by viruses, malware or by the user’s consent.

Installation software often replaced and deleted system files without properly checking if the file was still in use or of a newer version. This created a phenomenon often referred to as DLL hell. Windows Me introduced System File Protection and System Restore to handle common problems caused by this issue.

====Network sharing====
Windows 9x offers share-level access control security for file and printer sharing as well as user-level access control if a Windows NT-based operating system is available on the network. In contrast, Windows NT-based operating systems offer only user-level access control but integrated with the operating system&#x27;s own user account security mechanism.

===Hardware support===

====Drivers====

Device drivers in Windows 9x can be virtual device drivers or (starting with Windows 98) WDM drivers. VxDs usually have the filename extension codice_8 or codice_9, whereas WDM compatible drivers usually use the extension codice_10. The 32-bit VxD message server (msgsrv32) is a program that is able to load virtual device drivers (VxDs) at startup and then handle communication with the drivers. Additionally, the message server performs several background functions, including loading the Windows shell (such as Explorer.exe or Progman.exe).

Another type of device drivers are codice_11 drivers. These drivers are New Executable format and are loaded in user-mode, and are commonly used to control devices such as multimedia devices. To provide access to these devices, a dynamic link library is required (such as MMSYSTEM.DLL).

Windows 9x retains backwards compatibility with many drivers made for Windows 3.x and MS-DOS. Using MS-DOS drivers can limit performance and stability due to their use of conventional memory and need to run in real mode which requires the CPU to switch in and out of protected mode.

Drivers written for Windows 9x are loaded into the same address space as the kernel. This means that drivers can by accident or design overwrite critical sections of the operating system. Doing this can lead to system crashes, freezes and disk corruption. Faulty operating system drivers were a source of instability for the operating system.
Other monolithic and hybrid kernels, like Linux and Windows NT, are also susceptible to malfunctioning drivers impeding the kernel&#x27;s operation.

Often the software developers of drivers and applications had insufficient experience with creating programs for the &#x27;new&#x27; system, thus causing many errors which have been generally described as &quot;system errors&quot; by users, even if the error is not caused by parts of Windows or DOS. Microsoft has repeatedly redesigned the Windows Driver architecture since the release of Windows 95 as a result.

====CPU and bus technologies====
Windows 9x has no native support for hyper-threading, Data Execution Prevention, symmetric multiprocessing, APIC, or multi-core processors.

Windows 9x has no native support for SATA host bus adapters (and neither do Windows 2000 nor Windows XP for that matter), or USB drives (except for Windows Me). There are, however, many SATA-I controllers for which Windows 98/Me drivers exist (and indeed Windows 2000 and Windows XP also provided SATA support via third-party drivers as well), and USB mass storage support has been added to Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98 through third party drivers. Hardware driver support for Windows 98/Me began to decline in 2005, most notably with motherboard chipsets and video cards.

Early versions of Windows 95 had no support for USB or AGP acceleration (including lack of Infrared support for Windows 95 RTM). Windows 95 had preliminary support for ATAPI CD-ROMs, albeit with buggy ATAPI implementation. Windows 95 prior to OSR2 also had buggy support for processors implementing MMX as well as processors based on the P6 microarchitecture.

===MS-DOS===

Windows 95 was able to reduce the role of MS-DOS in Windows much further than had been done in Windows 3.1x and earlier. According to Microsoft developer Raymond Chen, MS-DOS served two purposes in Windows 95: as the boot loader, and as the 16-bit legacy device driver layer.

When Windows 95 started up, MS-DOS loaded, processed CONFIG.SYS, launched COMMAND.COM, ran AUTOEXEC.BAT and finally ran WIN.COM. The WIN.COM program used MS-DOS to load the virtual machine manager, read SYSTEM.INI, load the virtual device drivers, and then turn off any running copies of EMM386 and switch into protected mode. Once in protected mode, the virtual device drivers (VxDs) transferred all state information from MS-DOS to the 32-bit file system manager, and then shut off MS-DOS. These VxDs allow Windows 9x to interact with hardware resources directly, as providing low-level functionalities such as 32-bit disk access and memory management. All future file system operations would get routed to the 32-bit file system manager. In Windows Me, win.com was no longer executed during the startup process; instead it went directly to execute VMM32.VXD from IO.SYS.

The second role of MS-DOS (as the 16-bit legacy device driver layer) was as a backward compatibility tool for running DOS programs in Windows. Many MS-DOS programs and device drivers interacted with DOS in a low-level way, for example, by patching low-level BIOS interrupts such as int 13h, the low-level disk I/O interrupt. When a program issued an int 21h call to access MS-DOS, the call would go first to the 32-bit file system manager, which would attempt to detect this sort of patching. If it detects that the program has tried to hook into DOS, it will jump back into the 16-bit code to let the hook run. A 16-bit driver called IFSMGR.SYS would previously have been loaded by CONFIG.SYS, the job of which was to hook MS-DOS first before the other drivers and programs got a chance, then jump from 16-bit code back into 32-bit code, when the DOS program had finished, to let the 32-bit file system manager continue its work. According to Windows developer Raymond Chen, &quot;MS-DOS was just an extremely elaborate decoy. Any 16-bit drivers and programs would patch or hook what they thought was the real MS-DOS, but which was in reality just a decoy. If the 32-bit file system manager detected that somebody bought the decoy, it told the decoy to quack.&quot;

====MS-DOS Virtualization====
Windows 9x can run MS-DOS applications within itself using a method called &quot;Virtualization&quot;, where an application is run on a Virtual DOS machine.

====MS-DOS Mode====
Windows 95 and Windows 98 also offer backwards compatibility for DOS applications in the form of being able to boot into a native &quot;DOS Mode&quot; (MS-DOS can be booted without booting Windows, but not putting the CPU in protected mode). Through Windows 9x&#x27;s memory managers and other post-DOS improvements, the overall system performance and functionality is improved. Some old applications or games may not run properly in the virtual DOS environment within Windows and require real DOS Mode.

Having a command line mode outside of the GUI also offers the ability to fix certain system errors without entering the GUI. For example, if a virus is active in GUI mode it can often be safely removed in DOS mode, by deleting its files, which are usually locked while infected in Windows. Similarly, corrupted registry files, system files or boot files can be restored from real mode DOS. Windows 95 and Windows 98 can be started from DOS Mode by typing codice_12 at the command prompt and then hitting &quot;Enter&quot;, akin to earlier versions of Windows such as Windows 3.1.

===User interface===
Users can control a Windows 9x-based system through a command-line interface (or CLI) or a graphical user interface (or GUI). The default mode for Windows is usually the graphical user interface, whereas the CLI is available through MS-DOS windows. The GUI provides a means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interacts with the window system.

The GDI, which is a part of the Win32 and Win16 subsystems, is also a module that is loaded in user mode, unlike Windows NT where the GDI is loaded in kernel mode. Alpha compositing and therefore transparency effects, such as fade effects in menus, are not supported by the GDI in Windows 9x, unlike with Windows NT releases since Windows 2000.

Windows Explorer is the default user interface for the GUI; however, a variety of additional Windows shell replacements exist. Other GUIs include LiteStep, bbLean and Program Manager.

==In popular culture==
The sheer popularity of the Windows 9x series led to several web-based projects being created in the 2010s that aimed to replicate the look and feel of Windows 9x (and indeed an actual operating system as a whole) on a single web browser while also invoking nostalgia.

Windows 93 (stylized as &quot;WINDOWS93&quot; in the title) is a web-based parody site created by two French musicians and programmers who go by the names of jankenpopp and Zombectro. Designed to look and feel like an actual operating system, It is also a parody of the Windows 9x series. It features several web applications which reference and features various internet memes from the late 1990s up to the early 2000s.

EmuOS is another web-based site that aims to replicate the look and feel of Windows 9x as a whole, featuring 3 themes based on all major Windows 9x releases starting from Windows 95 up to Windows Me. It was created by Emupedia, a video game preservation and computer history community-based site, and was designed to play retro games and applications within a web browser. The aforementioned Windows 93 parody site is also featured.

Windows 98 has been recreated in web-based format under the name 98.js (also known as Windows 98 Online). It featured web-based versions of several classic Windows applications.

<text>Erroll Louis Garner (June 15, 1921 – January 2, 1977) was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his swing playing and ballads. His instrumental ballad &quot;Misty&quot;, his best-known composition, has become a jazz standard. It was first recorded in 1956 with Mitch Miller and his orchestra, and played a prominent part in the 1971 motion picture &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;.

Scott Yanow of Allmusic calls him &quot;one of the most distinctive of all pianists&quot; and a &quot;brilliant virtuoso&quot;. Garner received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6363 Hollywood Boulevard. His live album &quot;Concert by the Sea&quot; first released in 1955, sold more than 1 million copies by 1958, and Yanow&#x27;s opinion on the album is that it &quot;made such a strong impression that Garner was considered immortal from then on.&quot;

==Life and career==
Garner was born, along with twin brother Ernest in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on June 15, 1921, the youngest of six children. He attended George Westinghouse High School (as did fellow pianists Billy Strayhorn and Ahmad Jamal). Interviews with his family, music teachers, other musicians, and a detailed family tree can be found in &quot;Erroll Garner: The Most Happy Piano&quot; by James M. Doran.

===Piano career===

Garner began playing piano at the age of three. His elder siblings were taught piano by a &quot;Miss Bowman.&quot; From an early age, Erroll would sit down and play anything she had demonstrated, &quot;just like Miss Bowman&quot;, his eldest sister Martha said. Garner was self-taught and remained an &quot;ear player&quot; all his life, never learning to read music. At age 7, he began appearing on the radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh with a group named the Candy Kids. By age 11, he was playing on the Allegheny riverboats. In 1937 he joined local saxophonist Leroy Brown.

He played locally in the shadow of Linton Garner, his older brother, also a pianist.

Garner moved to New York City in 1944. He briefly worked with the bassist Slam Stewart, and although not a bebop musician per se, in 1947 played with Charlie Parker on the &quot;Cool Blues&quot; session. Although his admission to the Pittsburgh music union initially was refused because of his inability to read music, the union relented in 1956 and made him an honorary member. Garner is credited with a superb musical memory. After attending a concert by Russian classical pianist Emil Gilels, Garner returned to his apartment and was able to play a large portion of the performed music by memory.

===Columbia Records Lawsuit===
Garner sued Columbia Records in 1960 for breach of contract after Columbia released several recordings without Garner&#x27;s consent. Garner had signed a five-year deal with Columbia in 1956, which contained an unprecedented clause (negotiated with the aid of manager Martha Glaser) giving Garner the right to approve the release of any of his recorded music. After three years of litigation, during which time Columbia continued to release Garner recordings against his will, the New York State Supreme Court ruled in Garner&#x27;s favor in a landmark decision with regard to artist&#x27;s rights, and Columbia paid Garner a substantial settlement and recalled all of the unauthorized records from its distributors.

===Martha Glaser===
Garner was managed by Martha Glaser from 1950 until his death in 1977, with a period of this time as her only client.

===Death===
Garner died of cardiac arrest related to emphysema on January 2, 1977, aged 55. He is buried in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Homewood Cemetery.

==Playing style==

Short in stature (), Garner performed sitting on multiple telephone directories. He was also known for his vocalizations while playing, which can be heard on many of his recordings. He helped to bridge the gap for jazz musicians between nightclubs and the concert hall.

Called &quot;one of the most distinctive of all pianists&quot; by Scott Yanow, Garner showed that a &quot;creative jazz musician can be very popular without watering down his music&quot; or changing his personal style. He has been described as a &quot;brilliant virtuoso who sounded unlike anyone else&quot;, using an &quot;orchestral approach straight from the swing era but...open to the innovations of bop.&quot; His distinctive style could swing like no other, but some of his best recordings are ballads, such as his best-known composition, &quot;Misty&quot;, which rapidly became a jazz standard – and was featured in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s film &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; (1971).

Garner may have been inspired by the example of Earl Hines, a fellow Pittsburgh resident who was 18 years his senior, and there were resemblances in their elastic approach to timing and use of right-hand octaves. Garner&#x27;s early recordings display the influence of the stride piano style of James P. Johnson and Fats Waller. Garner&#x27;s melodic improvisations generally stayed close to the theme while employing novel chord voicings and other devices. He developed a signature style that involved his right hand playing slightly behind the beat while his left strummed a steady rhythm and punctuation, creating an insouciant quality and at the same time an exciting rhythmic tension. He would also enhance the effect by accelerating and decelerating the beat in the right hand, a device nicknamed the &quot;Russian Dragon&quot; (rushing and dragging). The independence of his hands also was evidenced by his masterful use of three-against-four and more complicated polyrhythms between the hands. In trio settings, he often played the 3:2 son clave rhythm pattern in his left hand chording on Latin tunes, and on swing tunes, he played the similar 12/8 Rhumba clave rhythm pattern. Garner frequently improvised whimsical introductions — often in stark contrast to the rest of the tune — that left listeners and even fellow band members in suspense as to what the piece would be or when the introduction would come to an end.

Bassist Ray Brown called Garner &quot;The Happy Man&quot;. Pianist Ross Tompkins described Garner&#x27;s distinctiveness as due to &quot;happiness&quot;.

==Works==
Garner&#x27;s first recordings were made in late 1944 at the apartment of Timme Rosenkrantz; these subsequently were issued as the five-volume &quot;Overture to Dawn&quot; series on Blue Note Records. His recording career advanced in the late 1940s when several sides such as &quot;Fine and Dandy&quot;, &quot;Skylark&quot; and &quot;Summertime&quot; were cut. His 1955 live album &quot;Concert by the Sea&quot; was a best-selling jazz album in its day and features Eddie Calhoun on bass and Denzil Best on drums. This recording of a performance at the Sunset Center, a former school in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, was made using relatively primitive sound equipment, but for George Avakian, the decision to release the recording was easy.

In 1954 Garner composed &quot;Misty&quot;, first recording it in 1955 for the album &quot;Contrasts&quot;. Lyrics were later added by Johnny Burke. &quot;Misty&quot; rapidly became popular, both as a jazz standard and as the signature song of Johnny Mathis. It was also recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Ray Stevens and Aretha Franklin.

&quot;One World Concert&quot; was recorded at the 1962 Seattle World Fair (and in 1959 stretching out in the studios) and features Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly Martin on drums. Other works include 1951&#x27;s &quot;Long Ago and Far Away&quot;, 1953&#x27;s &quot;Erroll Garner at the Piano&quot; with Wyatt Ruther and Fats Heard, 1957&#x27;s &quot;The Most Happy Piano&quot;, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Feeling Is Believing&quot; and 1974&#x27;s &quot;Magician&quot;, on which Garner performs a number of classic standards. Often the trio was expanded to add Latin percussion, usually a conga.

In 1964, Garner appeared in the UK on the music series &quot;Jazz 625&quot; broadcast on BBC Two The programme was hosted by Steve Race, who introduced Garner&#x27;s trio with Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly Martin on drums.

Because Garner could not write down his musical ideas, he used to record them on tape, to be later transcribed by others.

The Erroll Garner Club was founded in 1982 in Aberlady, Scotland. On September 26, 1992, Garnerphiles from England, Scotland, Germany and the US met in London for a unique and historic get-together. The guests of honour were Eddie Calhoun (bassist) and Kelly Martin (drummer), Garner&#x27;s rhythm section from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. On June 15, 1996, many of the UK&#x27;s Garnerphiles converged in Cheltenham for an afternoon of music, food and fun on what would have been Garner&#x27;s 75th birthday. That evening, they learned of the death of jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald.

===Archive and newly discovered material===

In 2012 a film on Garner was released by Atticus Brady called &quot;No One Can Hear You Read&quot;, which Garner used to say when asked why he had never learned to read music. Footage of the piano prodigy playing and speaking was intercut with interviews: with admirers (including Woody Allen, Steve Allen and his fellow musicians Ahmad Jamal, also from Pittsburgh and Ernest McCarty, his bassist for many years); with family members, including his big sister Ruth Garner Moore and daughter Kim Garner; with George Avakian, the producer of &quot;Concert by the Sea&quot;; and with Jim Doran his biographer. The film attempts to address Garner&#x27;s fall from prominence after his death, reminding viewers how popular and original he was in his day as well as why he is considered in many quarters a legend, one of the true greats of jazz.

On June 15, 2015, the estate of Martha Glaser, Garner&#x27;s longtime manager, announced the formation of the Erroll Garner Jazz Project, a major new archival and musical celebration of Garner. The project includes the donation of the Erroll Garner Archive—a huge trove of newly discovered historical material from Garner&#x27;s life—to the University of Pittsburgh.

On September 18, 2015, &quot;Concert by the Sea&quot; was re-released by Sony Legacy in an expanded, three-CD edition that adds 11 previously unreleased tracks.

On September 30, 2016, &quot;Ready Take One&quot; was released on Sony Legacy/Octave featuring 14 previously unreleased tracks.

On July 13, 2018, a live concert recording of Garner playing in 1964 at the Concertgebouw in the Netherlands was released by Mack Avenue Records with the title &quot;Nightconcert.&quot;

Garner was posthumously featured on the track &quot;All Night Parking&quot; with Adele on her fourth studio album, &quot;30&quot; (2021). The song is built around a sample of Joey Pecoraro&#x27;s &quot;Finding Parking&quot; (2017), which in turn samples Garner&#x27;s 1964 live performance of his song &quot;No More Shadows&quot; on the BBC television program &quot;Jazz 625&quot;.

===Publishing rights===
In 2016, Downtown Music Publishing entered an exclusive worldwide administration agreement with Octave Music Publishing Corp. The deal covers all of Garner&#x27;s works including &quot;Misty&quot;, as well as Garner&#x27;s extensive archive of master recordings, many of which remain unreleased.

<text>Alan Harvey Guth (; born February 27, 1947) is an American theoretical physicist and cosmologist who is the Victor Weisskopf Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Along with Alexei Starobinsky and Andrei Linde, he won the 2014 Kavli Prize &quot;for pioneering the theory of cosmic inflation.&quot; Guth&#x27;s research focuses on elementary particle theory and how particle theory is applicable to the early universe. 
He graduated from MIT in 1968 in physics and stayed to receive a master&#x27;s and a doctorate, also in physics.

As a junior particle physicist, Guth developed the idea of cosmic inflation in 1979 at Cornell and gave his first seminar on the subject in January 1980. Moving on to the SLAC Theory Group at Stanford University, Guth formally proposed the idea of cosmic inflation in 1981, the idea that the nascent universe passed through a phase of exponential expansion that was driven by a positive vacuum energy density (negative vacuum pressure). The results of the WMAP mission in 2006 made the case for cosmic inflation very compelling.

==Early life and education==
Guth was born to a Jewish family in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1947 and grew up across the Raritan River in Highland Park, where he attended the local public schools. After his junior year at Highland Park High School, he left school and enrolled in a five-year program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he could get his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s after two more years. Guth obtained a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in 1969 and a doctorate in 1972. In 1971, he married Susan Tisch, his high school sweetheart. They have two children: Lawrence (born 1977) and Jennifer (born 1983).

Guth was at Princeton 1971 to 1974, Columbia 1974 to 1977, Cornell 1977 to 1979, and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) 1979 to 1980. Like many other young physicists of the baby boom era, he had a hard time finding a permanent job, because there were far fewer assistant professorships than there were young scientists seeking such jobs, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the &quot;generation of lost scholars.&quot;

At the start of his career, Guth studied particle physics, not physical cosmology. Guth&#x27;s earliest work at Princeton was in the study of quarks, the elementary particles that make up protons and neutrons. At Columbia, Guth studied grand unification theories (GUTs), focusing on the cosmological phase transitions generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Most GUTs predict the generation of magnetic monopoles during spontaneous symmetry breaking, but none had ever been detected—the monopole problem.

==Career==
===Inflationary theory===
Guth&#x27;s first step to developing his theory of inflation occurred at Cornell in 1978, when he attended a lecture by Robert Dicke about the flatness problem of the universe. Dicke explained how the flatness problem showed that something significant was missing from the Big Bang theory at the time. The fate of the universe depended on its density. If the density of the universe was large enough, it would collapse into a singularity, and if the actual density of the matter in the cosmos was lower than the critical density, the universe would increasingly get much bigger.

The next part in Guth&#x27;s path came when he heard a lecture by Steven Weinberg in early 1979. Weinberg talked in two lectures about the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) that had been developed since 1974, and how it could explain the huge amount of matter in the universe compared to the amount of antimatter. The GUT explained all the fundamental forces known in science except for gravity. It established that in very hot conditions, such as those after the Big Bang, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force were united to form one force. Weinberg also was the one who emphasized the idea that the universe goes through phase transitions, similar to the phases of matter, when going from high energy to low energy. Weinberg&#x27;s discussion of why matter is so dominant over anti-matter showed Guth how precise calculations about particles could be obtained by studying the first few seconds of the universe.

Guth decided to solve this problem by suggesting a supercooling during a delayed phase transition. This seemed very promising for solving the magnetic monopole problem. By the time Guth and his collaborator Henry Tye came up with that, Guth had gone to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) for a year. Tye suggested that they check that the expansion of the universe would not be affected by the supercooling. The supercooled state is a false vacuum: It is a &quot;vacuum&quot; in the sense that it is the state of the lowest possible density of energy; it is &quot;false&quot; since its state is not permanent. False vacuums decay, and Guth found that the decay of the false vacuum at the beginning of the universe would produce an exponential expansion of space. This solved the monopole problem, since the expansion proportionately reduces the monopole density.

Guth realized from his theory that the reason the universe appears to be flat was that it had enlarged to such an overwhelming size in comparison to its original size. The perspective is analogous to the apparent flatness of the Earth, on a human scale, when seen from its surface. The &quot;observable&quot; universe was actually only a very small part of the &quot;actual&quot; universe. Traditional Big Bang theory found values of omega near 1 to be puzzling, because any deviations from 1 would quickly become much, much larger. In inflation theory, no matter where omega starts, it would approach 1 because of the scale of the universe&#x27;s expansion. In fact, a major prediction of inflationary theory is that omega will be found to be precisely 1.

Two weeks later, Guth heard colleagues discussing something called the horizon problem. The microwave background radiation discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson appeared extremely uniform, with almost no variance. This seemed very paradoxical because when the radiation was released about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the observable universe had a diameter of 90 million light-years. There was no time for one end of the cosmos to communicate with the other end, because energy cannot move faster than the speed of light. The paradox was resolved, as Guth soon realized, by the inflation theory. Since inflation started with a far smaller amount of matter than the Big Bang had presupposed, an amount so small that all parts would have been in touch with each other. The universe then inflated, at a rate corresponding to a billion times the speed of light, and the homogeneity remained unbroken. The universe after inflation would have been very uniform, even though its parts were no longer able to influence each other.

Guth first made public his ideas on inflation in a seminar at SLAC in January 1980. He ignored magnetic monopoles because they were based on assumptions of GUT, which was outside the scope of the speech. In August 1980, he submitted his paper, entitled &quot;Inflationary universe: A possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems&quot; to the journal &quot;Physical Review&quot;. In this paper Guth postulated that the inflation of the universe could be explained if the universe were supercooled 28 orders of magnitude below the critical temperatures required for a phase change.

In December 1981, Guth read a paper from Moscow physicist Andrei Linde saying that the whole universe is within just one bubble, so nothing is destroyed by wall collisions. This conclusion was made using a Higgs field with an energy graph that was originally proposed by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg. Guth discussed this with Linde, who had independently been working on bubble inflation, but without considering the flatness problem. Linde and Guth eventually exchanged papers on the subject.

By 1983, Guth had published a paper describing how his supercooled universe scenario was not ideal, as the &quot;triggering mechanism&quot; to exit such a state would require &quot;extreme fine tuning of parameters&quot; and felt a more natural solution was required. However, this did not deter him from the belief that the universe expanded exponentially in a vacuum in its early lifetime.

==Current interests==
In the past, Guth has studied lattice gauge theory, magnetic monopoles and instantons, Gott time machines, and a number of other topics in theoretical physics. Much of Guth&#x27;s current work includes extrapolating density fluctuations arising from various versions of inflation, to test against observations, and investigating inflation in &quot;brane world&quot; models.

He is the Victor F. Weisskopf Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has written more than 60 technical papers related to the effects of inflation and its interactions with particle physics.

==Honors and awards==

Guth has won many awards and medals, including the Medal of the International Center for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy, with Andrei Linde and Paul Steinhardt and the Eddington Medal in 1996, and the 2009 Isaac Newton Medal, awarded by the British Institute of Physics.

In July 2012, he was an inaugural awardee of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur, Yuri Milner.

In 2014, he was a co-recipient of the Kavli Prize awarded by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, together with Andrei Linde of Stanford University, and Alexei Starobinsky of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, &quot;for pioneering the theory of cosmic inflation.&quot; That same year, Guth received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2005, Guth won the award for the messiest office in Boston, organised by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. He was entered by colleagues who hoped it would shame him into tidying up, but Guth is quite proud of the award.

<text>This is a list of scientific units named after people. For other lists of eponyms (names derived from people) see eponym. By convention, the name of the unit is properly written starting with a lowercase letter (except where any word would be capitalized), but the first letter of its symbol is a capital letter if it is derived from a proper name.

<doc id="454501" wikidata="Q3113852" url="?curid=454501" title="I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!">
<text>I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! is a reality television format in which a number of celebrities live together in a jungle environment for a number of weeks, competing to be crowned &quot;King-&quot; or &quot;Queen of the Jungle&quot;.

The show was originally created in the United Kingdom by Granada Television and produced by its subsidiary, ITV&#x27;s then London franchise London Weekend Television (LWT) and developed by a team including James Allen, Natalka Znak, Brent Baker and Stewart Morris. The first episode was aired on 25 August 2002, hosted by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, better known as Ant and Dec.

It is now produced by ITV Studios and has been licensed globally to countries including the United States, Germany, France, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, Russia, Australia and India.

==Filming location==

The UK, German and the 2003 US versions of the series take place in New South Wales, Australia, at a permanently-built up camp and filming studios on a disused banana plantation facility called Dungay Creek in Dungay near Murwillumbah. However, the first UK series of the show (aired in 2002) was filmed on a smaller site close to King Ranch (officially El Rancho del Rey) in Cardstone, with a temporary studio built on the banks of Kooroomool Creek, near Tully, Queensland, in Australia. For the fifth British series in 2005, there were reportedly plans to relocate the show to the coastal town of Cardwell (also in Queensland); however these were subsequently dropped due to logistical problems and time constraints in building the new set and required infrastructure.

The leaseholder of the privately owned Dungay site is the British production company ITV Studios, formerly Granada Television, which extensively redesigned and built on the previously open site and equipped it with camera and sound technology for TV broadcasting. About 600 mostly Australian crew members, including 136 from the UK, are involved in the yearly production and in excess of 100 cameras are used. Inside the entrance to the filming location is an open area allocated to buildings which accommodate on-site medical facilities, containers for the storage of props, and other backstage facilities. Families and friends of the celebrities are housed here each morning during evictions. A restricted access road ascends to the location of the studios from this area. The four-wheel drive access to the show&#x27;s set then descends into a valley.
In August 2020, it was confirmed that due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions, the 20th UK series would be filmed in Gwrych Castle in Abergele, North Wales. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 15th season of the German version was originally planned for 2021 to take place for the first time in the history of the show not in Australia, but in North Wales, at Gwrych Castle. However, on 22 October 2020, it was announced that production in Wales had been cancelled and that broadcaster RTL was working on a new concept. On 2 August 2021, it was announced that, due to Australia&#x27;s border remaining closed amid COVID-19 restrictions in the country, filming for the UK version would again be taking place at Gwrych Castle in Abergele, Wales. As part of the agreement with Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, ITV announced it would continue to help support the ongoing restoration project of the site.

The Australian series is usually filmed in Blyde River Canyon near Hoedspruit and Kruger National Park, in South Africa. The seventh season, however, was pre-recorded in Australia during late 2020 at the site used by the British and German versions since 2003. On 18 October 2021, it was announced by RTL that the German version would now be filmed at the same location in South Africa instead of its usual home in Australia, taking the filming slot previously occupied by the Australian version. In September 2022, it was confirmed that ITV would pre-record a special &quot;All-Stars&quot; series in South Africa, featuring former campmates and scheduled to air in 2023. 

Other versions of the show have been filmed in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Suriname, Indonesia and Malaysia.

==Criticism==
This series has been criticised by Tessa Jowell, at the time the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. In an interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot; during the second UK series, she said, &quot;If they weren&#x27;t mostly – save their blushes – has-been celebrities, there might be more interest ... I think that if we saw many more programming hours taken over by reality TV, I hope you&#x27;d begin to see a viewers&#x27; revolt.&quot;

In 2002, CBS, broadcaster of the popular American reality show &quot;Survivor&quot;, unsuccessfully sued ABC and Granada Television over a planned American version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, alleging similarities. The production company behind &quot;Survivor&quot; also attempted to take legal action, but this was later dropped.

The show&#x27;s use of live insects and other living creatures in the bushtucker trials has led to some public criticism of the show and its producers and those involved in the programming. This issue was highlighted during the 2009 UK series, where celebrity chef Gino D&#x27;Acampo killed, cooked and ate a rat. The RSPCA Australia investigated the incident and sought to prosecute D&#x27;Acampo and actor Stuart Manning for animal cruelty after this episode of the show was aired. ITV was fined but the two celebrities involved were not prosecuted for animal cruelty despite being charged with the offence by the New South Wales Police. This incident did, however, highlight among certain groups such as Buglife, a British charity for the conservation of insects, and the RSPCA, the controversy surrounding the killing of living creatures for human entertainment.

There has been criticism that the producers present the celebrities as living in a &quot;dangerous&quot; jungle, despite the fact that they are actually kept in a controlled environment, with some of the scenery being artificial, e.g. a pond and a small waterfall.

In November 2014, TV presenter Chris Packham wrote an open letter to Ant &amp; Dec, asking them and ITV to end the &quot;abuse of animals&quot; in &quot;I&#x27;m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. He described the trials as &quot;out of date&quot; and &quot;silly&quot;. Packham again requested that the programme end its perceived animal abuse on stage during the 2019 TV Choice Awards, whilst imploring celebrities and those in the television industry to be more conscious of the environment.

In January 2021, the Australian version of the reality show received criticism for its &quot;sick&quot;, &quot;traumatic&quot; and &quot;unnecessary&quot; content when a contestant was bitten by a snake in an episode.

In November 2022, the British instalment was criticized for its casting of Matt Hancock as a contestant, the serving Member of Parliament for West Suffolk who had been disgraced for his breaching of COVID-19 guidelines as Health Secretary. ITV reportedly paid Hancock £400,000 to participate.

<doc id="454513" wikidata="Q1033548" url="?curid=454513" title="Love hotel">
<text>A love hotel is a type of short-stay hotel found around the world operated primarily for the purpose of allowing guests privacy for sex. The name originates from &quot;Hotel Love&quot; in Osaka. Although love hotels exist all over the world, the term &quot;love hotel&quot; is often used to refer specifically to those located within Japan.

==Distinguishing characteristics==


Love hotels can usually be identified using symbols such as hearts and the offer of a room rate for a as well as for an overnight stay. The period of a &quot;rest&quot; varies, typically ranging from one to three hours. Cheaper daytime off-peak rates are common. In general, reservations are not possible, and leaving the hotel will forfeit access to the room; overnight-stay rates become available only after 22:00. These hotels may be used for prostitution, although they are sometimes used by budget-travelers sharing accommodation.

Entrances are discreet, and interaction with staff is minimized. Rooms are often selected from a panel of buttons, and the bill may be settled by pneumatic tube, vending machine, or paying an unseen staff member behind a pane of frosted glass. Parking lots will often be concealed and windows will be few, so as to maximize privacy.

Although cheaper hotels are often simply furnished, higher-end hotels may feature fanciful rooms decorated with anime characters, be equipped with rotating beds, ceiling mirrors, karaoke machines, and unusual lighting. They may be styled similarly to dungeons or other fantasy scenes, sometimes including S&amp;M gear.

These hotels are typically either concentrated in city districts close to stations, near highways on the city outskirts or in industrial districts. Love hotel architecture is sometimes garish, with buildings shaped like castles, boats or UFOs and lit with neon lighting. Some more recent love hotels are ordinary looking buildings, distinguished mainly by having small, covered or no windows.

==Around the world==

=== Hong Kong ===
There are three predominant chained hourly hotel groups (Victoria, Park Excellent, and Kowloon Tong) in Hong Kong since the 90s, as the economy was booming. There were hundreds of nightclubs opening, and many of those girls offer prostitution service (both hourly, overnight), where people usually opted for the cheaper option (hourly) and that play a big role in the growing trend of hourly hotels. But after the era of 2010s, hourly hotels are mainly for couples, because having a personal place is becoming a luxury most people cannot afford.

=== Canada ===
A Japanese-influenced love hotel project in Canada opened its doors in Toronto in early 2019, which was the first and only love hotel in the country to offer an authentic Japanese experience. Due to the love hotel only being a temporary project, it has been closed down since late 2019.

===Japan===
The history of can be traced back to the 17th century, in the early Edo period, when establishments appearing to be inns or teahouses with particular procedures for a discreet entry or even with secret tunnels for a discreet exit were built in Edo and in Kyoto. Modern love hotels developed from the tea rooms used mostly by prostitutes and their clients but also by lovers. After World War II, the term was adopted, originally for simple lodgings run by families with a few rooms to spare. These establishments appeared first around Ueno, Tokyo in part due to demand from Occupation forces, and boomed after 1958 when legal prostitution was abolished and the trade moved underground.

The introduction of the automobile in the 1960s brought with it the &quot;motel&quot; and further spread the concept. Japanese housing trends at the time were characterized by small homes with sleeping areas being used as common areas during the day and, as a result, little opportunity for parents to engage privately in intercourse. Married couples therefore began to frequent love hotels. By 1961, there were around 2,700 inns in central Tokyo alone. Hotels of the time featured unusual attractions such as swings and vibrating beds. The Meguro Emperor, the first castle-style love hotel, opened in 1973 and brought in an average of approximately ¥40 million monthly.

In 1984, the Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Law placed love hotels under the jurisdiction of the police. For that reason, new hotels were built to avoid being classified as &quot;love hotels&quot;; the garish, over-the-top, bizarre designs and features of the past were significantly downplayed. Beginning in the 1980s, love hotels were also increasingly marketed toward women. A 2013 study showed that couples&#x27; selections of rooms at love hotels were made by women roughly 90% of the time. The Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Law was amended in 2010, imposing even stricter limitations and blurring the line between regular hotels and love hotels. Keeping in mind legislation and a desire to seem more fashionable than competitors, an ever-changing palette of terms is used by hotel operators. Alternative names include &quot;romance hotel&quot;, &quot;fashion hotel&quot;, &quot;leisure hotel&quot;, &quot;amusement hotel&quot;, &quot;couples hotel&quot;, and &quot;boutique hotel&quot;.

Love hotels have enough cultural significance to be added to the first edition of emojis in Unicode 6.0.

===South Korea===
Love hotels (), also known as love motels, first appeared in South Korea in the mid-1980s. They were originally called &quot;Parktel&quot; (). Their boom and growth was originally attributed to the 1988 Olympics which took place in Seoul. The hotels have historically been seen as seedy, with some residents speaking out against them and not wanting them within certain distances of schools and residential areas. Some hotel owners have tried to remove that element from their business by upgrading, offering cleaner modern services, and removing some of the more sexual elements from their decor. They are considered a taboo topic in South Korea and a photo exhibit of love motels taken by a foreigner created a controversy in 2010.

===Thailand===
Thailand has had love motels since 1935 and there are approximately 100 establishments in Bangkok most densely located around Ratchadaphisek Road. The government no longer issues building permits for these types of motels, but some businesses work around the laws. In addition to short-stay, the motels are also used by foreign travellers on a budget.

===Other countries===
Similar establishments also exist in other Asian countries including for example Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. India&#x27;s first love hotel opened in 2015.

The same concept also exists in Central and South America. In Guatemala, they are called &quot;autohotels&quot;; in Chile &quot;motel&quot; or &quot;hotel parejero&quot; (couples&#x27; hotel); in the Dominican Republic, &quot;cabañas&quot;, &quot;moteles&quot; or &quot;estaderos&quot;; in Panama they are called &quot;llcasas de citas&quot;, &quot;moteles&quot;, &quot;casas de ocasion&quot;, &quot;push buttons&quot; or &quot;push&quot; for short; in Argentina and Uruguay, &quot;albergue transitorio&quot; or more informally, &quot;telo&quot;, which is &quot;hotel&quot; in reverse. In Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Puerto Rico, they are simply called &quot;motels&quot; (the word is exclusively used for love hotels). In Brazil &quot;motels&quot; (approximately 5,000) are part of the urban landscape. Very popular, they are associated with erotic transgression, but also with romantic love. They usually offer protected parking and, from long before the video era, contactless check-in.

In Panama, love hotels were first opened in the 1950s. They are often (but not always) fenced with painted opaque walls and are nondescript, are arranged like large outdoor self-storage facilities, rooms have their own garage, and guests can only enter the hotel and its garages while inside a car. They are also used as regular motels. Inside the garage is the door that leads to the room, its price and a &quot;push button&quot; that unlocks the door of the room when pressed or &quot;pushed&quot;.

In Nigeria, love hotels are called &quot;short-time&quot;. They are often low-budget accommodations in densely populated areas. Some other hotels offer &quot;short-time&quot; services unofficially.

In the United States and Canada, certain motels in low-income areas often serve similar functions as a Japanese love hotel. Colloquially known as &quot;no-tell motels&quot; or &quot;hot-sheets joints&quot;, these are becoming scarce as local laws increasingly require renters&#x27; identification information to be recorded and given to law enforcement agencies. However, the US Supreme Court struck down warrantless searches of hotel records in 2015. In the early 21st century, various adult establishments such as strip clubs, adult arcades, and x-rated book and video stores, sometimes offer rooms with a little privacy for an hourly fee, no ID required. In Miami-Dade County a chain of hourly-rate motels announce openly that their rooms are intended for sex, sometimes with parking in a garage with a door, with the room on top of the garage. Identification is generally required. In the Midwestern United States, a chain of short-to-overnight-stay hotels, Sybaris Pool Suites, offer only rooms with varying luxuries for couples, including swimming pools, whirlpools, saunas, and even waterfalls, along with large beds and lounging areas, and their marketing exclusively focuses on couples, never using the term &quot;hotel&quot;, much less &quot;love hotel&quot;.

In Oceania, New Zealand opened its first love hotel in May 2011, and Australia opened its first love hotel in August 2011.

== Economic aspects ==
The annual revenue of the love hotel industry in Japan was estimated in 2009 at more than $40 billion, a figure double that of Japan&#x27;s anime market.

It is estimated that more than 500 million visits to Japan&#x27;s 37,000 love hotels take place each year, which is the equivalent of around 1.4 million couples, or 2% of Japan&#x27;s population, visiting a love hotel each day. In recent years, the love hotel business has drawn the interest of the structured finance industry.

Several transactions have been completed where the cash flows from a number of such hotels have been securitised and sold to international investors and buy-out funds.

<text>Marzipan is a confection consisting primarily of sugar and almond meal (ground almonds), sometimes augmented with almond oil or extract.

It is often made into sweets; common uses are chocolate-covered marzipan and small marzipan imitations of fruits and vegetables. It can also be used in biscuits or rolled into thin sheets and glazed for icing cakes, primarily birthday cakes, wedding cakes and Christmas cakes. Marzipan may also be used as a baking ingredient, as in stollen or banket. In some countries, it is shaped into small figures of animals as a traditional treat for New Year&#x27;s Day or Christmas. Marzipan is also used in Tortell, and in some versions of king cake eaten during the Carnival season.
== Around the world ==
=== Europe ===

The Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union recognize two marzipans in Europe: one in Toledo (Spain) and one in Lübeck (Germany). 

==== Southern Europe ====
In Spain, marzipan is a traditional Christmas dessert (), although in Toledo, where the first written reference of this product dates back to 1512, it is eaten all year round. In Italy, particularly in Palermo, marzipan () is often shaped and painted with food colourings to resemble fruit——especially during the Christmas season and on (All Souls&#x27; Day) on November 2. May 9 and 10 are also special days for eating marzipan in Sicily. In Portugal, where the confection has been traditionally made by nuns, marzipan () is used to make fruit-shaped sweets; in the Algarve region in particular it is a very common sweet, where it is shaped like fruits and filled with Fios de ovos. There are other regions, as Toledo in Spain in which marzipan () is shaped into simple animal shapes, and sometimes filled in with egg yolk () and sugar. In Greece and Cyprus, marzipan is made in a variety of shapes and sizes and is almost always left white. In the islands of the Aegean in particular, white marzipan is considered a wedding treat and is served to guests at wedding feasts.
In Malta, marzipan is used as a filling in the traditional Maltese Easter treats called figolli (singular: figolla). It is also popular in Turkey, where it is called . There are two regional variations registered in the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office.

==== Northern Europe ====

In Denmark, Sweden and Norway, it is customary to snack on marzipan pigs around Christmas, marzipan shaped as eggs around Easter, and &quot;kransekage&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve. It is also used in a large variety of cakes and confectioneries unrelated to the holidays, including , , and , and as an ingredient in remonce-filling for Danish pastry.

In Maiasmokk café in Tallinn, Estonia, there is a small museum dedicated to the history and manufacture of marzipan.

Traditional Swedish princess cake is typically covered with a layer of marzipan that has been tinted pale green or pink.

Traditional Finnish Käpykakku is typically coated with a layer of marzipan, which is dark brown color and Conifer cone-shaped and spiky.

==== Western and Central Europe ====
In Belgium and the Netherlands, (&#x27;marzipan&#x27;) figures are given as Sinterklaas (Saint Nicholas) presents.

In France, is the specialty of Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, a town in Limousin. It comes in biscuit shape. It is also prepared in Gironde, it is named &quot;Girondin pudding&quot; made from hard bread, brown sugar and flavored with raisins soaked in rum.
In Germany, it is common to gift marzipan in the shape of a loaf of bread () or in the shape of small potatoes () during Christmas time. Stollen can contain marzipan, and it is often featured as an ingredient in seasonal baked goods, such as Bethmännchen, Dominosteine and other Christmas cookies. One traditional new year present is known as a (&#x27;lucky pig&#x27;). Mozartkugeln are a famed export of Austria made of marzipan balls dipped in dark chocolate.

In the United Kingdom, celebratory fruitcakes are decorated with a layer of marzipanparticularly Christmas cake which is covered with white sugar icing, and at Easter the Simnel cake contains a layer of marzipan, a further layer decorates the top and is lightly grilled or toasted to colour it. Battenberg cake, which originates in England, is covered in a layer of marzipan.

In Geneva, a traditional part of the celebration of is the ritual smashing of a chocolate cauldron filled with marzipan vegetables, a reference to a Savoyard siege of the city which was supposedly foiled by a housewife with a cauldron of boiling soup.

=== Middle East ===

In Syria, marzipan is known as , (, derived from , &#x27;almond&#x27;), or (the ). It is flavoured with orange-flower water and shaped into roses and other delicate flowers before being baked. Marzipan can also be made from oatmeal, farina, or semolina.

For Jews in Iran, marzipan fruit is a traditional Passover treat, replacing biscuits and cakes. According to Sephardic Jewish custom, friends of the woman giving birth would cook for her and prepare homemade marzipan. This was believed to enhance the mother’s milk and was considered a symbol of purity and good fortune for both mother and baby.

=== The Americas ===
In Latin American cuisine, marzipan is known by the and is traditionally eaten at Christmas. In some Latin American countries, forms of are made from nuts or seeds other than almonds. In Guatemala, a specialty from Amatitlán is made with pumpkin seed (pepita), rice and sugar. Mexican is typically made from peanuts. This peanut paste preparation is used in a commercial Mexican candy called .

=== Asia ===
In the Indian state of Goa, marzipan () was introduced from Portugal. However, the Goan version uses cashew nuts instead of almonds. Goan marzipan is used to make Easter eggs. It is also used to make Christmas sweets in various shapes like fruits, flowers, stars, etc. Similarly, in the city of Mumbai, the East Indians mould their cashewnut-based or almond-based marzipan into different shapes for Christmas and into marzipan eggs, chickens and bonnets for Easter.

In the Philippines marzipan was brought from Spain, (Spanish for &#x27;pili marzipan&#x27;) is made from pili nuts.

== History ==
There are two proposed lines of origin for marzipan; they are not necessarily contradictory and may be complementary, as there have always been Mediterranean trade and cooking influences. Other sources establish the origin of marzipan in China, from where the recipe moved on to the Middle East and then to Europe through Al-Andalus.

=== Northeast Mediterranean line ===
Although it is believed to have been introduced to Eastern Europe through the Turks (in ), and most notably produced in Edirne), there is some dispute between Hungary and Italy over its origin. Marzipan became a specialty of the Hanseatic League port towns. In particular, the cities of Lübeck and Tallinn have a proud tradition of marzipan manufacture. Examples include Lübecker Marzipan, which has Protected geographical indication (PGI) status. The city&#x27;s manufacturers such as Niederegger still guarantee their marzipan to contain two-thirds almonds by weight, which results in a product of highest quality. Historically, the city of Königsberg in East Prussia was also renowned for its distinctive marzipan production. Königsberg marzipan remains a special type of marzipan in Germany that is golden brown on its surface and sometimes embedded with marmalade at its centre.

In the United States, marzipan is not officially defined, but it is generally made with a higher ratio of sugar to almonds than almond paste. One brand, for instance, has 28% almonds in its marzipan, and 45% almonds in its almond paste. However, in Sweden and Finland almond paste refers to a marzipan that contains 50% ground almonds, a much higher quality than regular marzipan. In Germany, Lübecker Marzipan is known for its quality. It contains 66% almonds. The original manually produced Mozartkugeln are made from green pistachio marzipan.

=== Iberian Peninsula line ===

Another possible geographic origin is the parts of Spain that were known as Al-Andalus. In Toledo (850–900, though more probably 1150 during the reign of Alfonso VII) this specialty was known as &quot;Postre Regio&quot; (instead of &quot;Mazapán&quot;). There are also mentions in the folktale collection, &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; of an almond paste eaten during Ramadan and as an aphrodisiac.
Mazapán is Toledo&#x27;s most famous dessert, often created for Christmas, and has PGI status. For this, almonds have to be at least 50% of the total weight, following the directives of &quot;Mazapán de Toledo&quot; regulator council.
Another idea to support this line is the important tradition of another Spanish almond-based Christmas confectionery, the &quot;turrón&quot;.

== Variations ==
Persipan is a similar, but less expensive product, in which the almonds are replaced by apricot or peach kernels. Many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from less expensive materials, such as soy paste and almond essence. To control and detect the authenticity of marzipan, polymerase chain reaction methods can differentiate almonds from substitutes and adulterants at concentrations of less than one percent. German marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste, and French marzipan (called ) is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup. Some marzipan is flavoured with rosewater. Spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds. In the United States, bitter almonds are not used in marzipan because the importation of bitter almonds into the country is prohibited by US law, owing to them containing a substance related to cyanide. Sugar-free marzipan can be made by replacing sugar with polyols such as maltitol. Varieties made with other types of nuts are eaten in Latin America, and peanut-based marzipan is the most common variety in Mexico.

== Etymology ==
The German name has largely ousted the original English name &quot;marchpane&quot; with the same apparent derivation: &#x27;March bread&#x27;. (The word &quot;marchpane&quot; occurs in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Act 1, Scene 5, Line 9.) &quot;Marzapane&quot; is documented earlier in Italian than in any other language, and the term &quot;pan&quot; meaning &#x27;bread&#x27; originates in Romance languages. The origin could be from the Latin term &#x27;, which means &quot;bread of March&quot;. In Johann Burchard’s &quot;Diarium curiae romanae&quot; (1483–1492) the Latin form appears as &#x27;.

The ultimate etymology is unclear; for example, the Italian word derives from the Latin words &quot;Massa&quot; (itself from Greek &quot;Maza&quot;) meaning pastry and &quot;Pan&quot; meaning bread, this can be particularly seen in the Provençal &quot;massapan&quot;, in Catalan &quot;massapà&quot;, the Portuguese &quot;maçapão&quot; (where &#x27;ç&#x27; is an alternative letter for the phoneme usually expressed by &#x27;ss&#x27;) and old Spanish &quot;mazapán&quot; – the change from &#x27;ss&#x27; to &#x27;z&#x27; in Latin words was common in old Spanish and the &#x27;r&#x27; appeared later. Among the other possible etymologies set forth in the Oxford English Dictionary, one theory proposes that the word &quot;marzipan&quot; may be a corruption of Martaban, a Burmese city famous for its jars.

The Real Academia Española suggests the Spanish is perhaps derived from the Hispanic Arabic , , from the Greek , (&#x27;little cake&#x27;).
Another possible source is from &#x27;king who sits still&#x27;. The Arabic, Latinised as , was used to describe a Venetian coin depicting an enthroned Christ the King. These coins were stored in ornate boxes. From about the fifteenth century, when the coins were no longer in circulation, the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats. One such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the now-famous almond-flavoured marzipan, named (at least proximately) after the box in which it was stored.

== Production ==
To produce marzipan, raw almonds are cleaned &quot;by sieving, air elutriation, and other electronic or mechanical devices&quot;, then immersed in water with a temperature just below the boiling point for about five minutes, in a process known as blanching. This loosens the almonds&#x27; skin, which is removed by passing the almonds through rubber-covered rotating cylinders. They are then cooled, after which they are coarsely chopped and ground, with up to 35% sugar, into almond flour. In the traditional production of marzipan raw filler, a similar process is followed: Sweet almonds are scalded, peeled on rubber-covered rolls, coarsely chopped, and then ground with the addition of not more than 35% of sucrose. 

The almond flour mixture is roasted and cooled, after which sucrose (table sugar) and possibly a binding agent such as starch syrup or sorbitol are added. It may then be moulded into any shape. Marzipan must be covered in an airtight container to prevent it from hardening and dehydrating. It should be protected from direct light to prevent rancidity of the almond oil, resulting from lipid oxidation.

== Science ==

=== Molecular composition ===

The aroma and flavor of marzipan can in part be attributed to benzaldehyde, which is formed from amygdalin

=== Physical structure ===
Marzipan is a food emulsion that contains four phases: a solid phase of suspended particles including almonds and sugars, a suspended air pocket phase formed from incorporated air during mixing, a water phase, and a lipid phase from almond oil. The phases can separate when left alone for long periods of time. It is stabilized by the phospholipids and triglycerides found in the almond cells. The fatty acids found in almonds include saturated fats such as stearic acid and unsaturated fats such as linoleic acid. Emulsifiers can be added during production to increase shelf life.

Marzipan&#x27;s softness is a balance between the solid and liquid components. It should have a moisture content of less than 10%.

<text>Andrew Thomas Knights Crozier (26 July 1943 – 3 April 2008) was a poet associated with the British Poetry Revival.

==Life==
Crozier was educated at Dulwich College, and later Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His 1976 book &quot;Pleats&quot; won the Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize, awarded jointly that year with Lee Harwood. He was co-editor of the important Revival magazine &quot;The English Intelligencer&quot; and for many years ran Ferry Press, an independent poetry publisher that issued books by Anthony Barnett, David Chaloner, Douglas Oliver, J. H. Prynne, Peter Riley, and others. With Tim Longville he edited the influential anthology &quot;A Various Art&quot;. He also edited the poems of Carl Rakosi and John Rodker. His collected poems, &quot;All Where Each Is&quot; was published in 1985. Crozier was Professor of Prose at the University of Sussex, where his research interests were listed as English and American poetry and poetics, with special reference to the romantic and modern periods.

Andrew Crozier died from a brain tumour on 3 April 2008.

<text>The black geese of the genus Branta are waterfowl belonging to the true geese and swans subfamily Anserinae. They occur in the northern coastal regions of the Palearctic and all over North America, migrating to more southerly coasts in winter, and as resident birds in the Hawaiian Islands. Alone in the Southern Hemisphere, a self-sustaining feral population derived from introduced Canada geese is also found in New Zealand. 

The black geese derive their vernacular name for the prominent areas of black coloration found in all species. They can be distinguished from all other true geese by their legs and feet, which are black or very dark grey. Furthermore, they have black bills and large areas of black on the head and neck, with white (ochre in one species) markings that can be used to tell apart most species. As with most geese, their undertail and uppertail coverts are white. They are also on average smaller than other geese, though some very large taxa are known, which rival the swan goose and the black-necked swan in size.

The Eurasian species of black geese have a more coastal distribution compared to the grey geese (genus &quot;Anser&quot;) which share the same general area of occurrence, not being found far inland even in winter (except for occasional stray birds or individuals escaped from captivity). This does not hold true for the American and Pacific species, in whose ranges grey geese are, for the most part, absent.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Branta&quot; was introduced by the Austrian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1769. The name is a Latinised form of Old Norse &quot;Brandgás&quot; meaning burnt as in &quot;burnt (black) goose&quot;. The type species is the brant goose (&quot;Branta bernicla&quot;).

Ottenburghs and colleagues published a study in 2016 that established the phylogenetic relationships between the species.
===Species list===
The genus contains six living species.





Two species have been described from subfossil remains found in the Hawaiian Islands, where they became extinct in prehistoric times:
* Nēnē-nui or wood-walking goose, &quot;Branta hylobadistes&quot; (prehistoric)
:Similar but hitherto undescribed remains are known from on Kauaʻi and Oʻahu.
* Giant Hawaii goose, &quot;Branta rhuax&quot; (prehistoric), formerly &quot;Geochen rhuax&quot;

The relationships of the enigmatic &quot;Geochen rhuax&quot;, formerly known only from parts of a single bird&#x27;s skeleton damaged due to apparently dying in a lava flow, were long unresolved. After reexamination of the subfossil material and comparisons with other subfossil bones from the island of Hawaii assigned to the genus &quot;Branta&quot;, it was redescribed as &quot;Branta rhuax&quot; in 2013. While a presumed relation between &quot;B. rhuax&quot; and the shelducks, proposed by Lester Short in 1970, has thus been refuted, bones of a shelduck-like bird have been found more recently on Kaua‘i. Whether this latter anatid was indeed a shelduck is presently undetermined.

Similarly, two bones found on Oʻahu indicate the erstwhile presence of a gigantic waterfowl on this island. Its relationships relative to this genus and the moa-nalos, enormous goose-like dabbling ducks, are completely undeterminable at present.

===Early fossil record===
Several fossil species of &quot;Branta&quot; have been described. Since the true geese are hardly distinguishable by anatomical features, the allocation of these to this genus is somewhat uncertain. A number of supposed prehistoric grey geese have been described from North America, partially from the same sites as species assigned to &quot;Branta&quot;. Whether these are correctly assigned – meaning that the genus &quot;Anser&quot; was once much more widespread than today and that it coexisted with &quot;Branta&quot; in freshwater habitat which it today does only most rarely – is not clear. Especially in the case of &quot;B. dickeyi&quot; and &quot;B. howardae&quot;, doubts have been expressed about its correct generic assignment.
*&quot;Branta woolfendeni&quot; (Big Sandy Late Miocene of Wickieup, USA)
*&quot;Branta thessaliensis&quot; (Late Miocene of Perivolaki, Greece)
*&quot;Branta dickeyi&quot; (Late Pliocene – Late Pleistocene of W USA)
*&quot;Branta esmeralda&quot; (Esmeralda Early Pliocene)
*&quot;Branta howardae&quot; (Ricardo Early Pliocene)
*&quot;Branta propinqua&quot; (Middle Pleistocene of Fossil Lake, USA)
*&quot;Branta hypsibata&quot; (Pleistocene of Fossil Lake, USA)

The former &quot;&quot;Branta&quot; minuscula&quot; is now placed with the prehistoric American shelducks, &quot;Anabernicula&quot;. On the other hand, a goose fossil from the Early-Middle Pleistocene of El Salvador is highly similar to &quot;Anser&quot; and given its age and biogeography it is likely to belong to that genus or &quot;Branta&quot;.

<text>Warner Music Group Corp., commonly abbreviated as WMG, is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is one of the &quot;big three&quot; recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Group (SMG). 

Formerly owned by Time Warner (later called WarnerMedia and now known as Warner Bros. Discovery), the company sold WMG in 2004 to a group of private investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr., in a move to alleviate Time Warner&#x27;s debt load related to their takeover of AOL. WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. As of 2025, Access Industries remains the company&#x27;s largest shareholder, owning 72% of the equity and controlling 98% of the voting power.

With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 4,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world. The company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (previously owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world&#x27;s largest music publishers.

==History==
===1950s and 1960s===
The film studio Warner Bros. had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors, Tab Hunter, scored a No. 1 hit song in 1957 for Dot Records, a division of rival Paramount Pictures. In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies, and to also capitalize on the music business, Warner Bros. Records was created in 1958; its original office was located above the film studio&#x27;s machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank, California. In 1963, Warner purchased Reprise Records, which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings. With the Reprise acquisition, Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin, who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner/Reprise.

After Warner Bros. was sold to Seven Arts Productions in 1967 (forming Warner Bros.-Seven Arts), it purchased Atlantic Records, founded in 1947 and WMG&#x27;s oldest label (until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in 2013), as well as its subsidiary Atco Records. This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner&#x27;s longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label&#x27;s period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young&#x27;s only major recordings not under WMG ownership.

Atlantic, its subsidiary Atco Records, and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner&#x27;s rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic&#x27;s lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T &amp; the MGs, Sam &amp; Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner.

An earlier attempt by Warner Bros. Records to create an in-house distribution arm in 1958 did not materialize. So in 1969, Elektra Records boss Jac Holzman approached Atlantic&#x27;s Jerry Wexler with the idea of setting up a joint distribution network for Warner, Elektra, and Atlantic. An experimental branch was established in Southern California as a possible prototype for an expanded operation.

====Atlantic exerts autonomy====
It was soon apparent in 1969 that Atlantic/Atco president Ahmet Ertegun viewed Warner/Reprise president Mike Maitland as a rival. Maitland believed that, as vice-president in charge of the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts music division, he should have final say over all recording operations, and he further angered Ertegun by proposing that most of Atlantic&#x27;s back-office functions (such as marketing and distribution) be combined with the existing departments at Warner/Reprise. In retrospect Ertegun clearly feared that Maitland would ultimately have more power than him, and so he moved rapidly to secure his own position and remove Maitland.

Maitland had put off renegotiating the contracts of Joe Smith and Mo Ostin, the presidents of the Warner Bros. and Reprise labels, and this provided Ertegun with an effective means of undermining Maitland. When Wexler—now a major shareholder—found out about the contract issue he and Ertegun began pressuring Eliot Hyman to get Smith and Ostin under contract, ostensibly because they were worried that the two executives might move to rival labels—and in fact Ostin had received overtures from both MGM Records and ABC Records.

In 1969, the wisdom of Hyman&#x27;s investments was proved when Kinney National Company purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts for $400 million, more than eight times what Hyman had paid for Warner/Reprise and Atlantic combined. From the base of his family&#x27;s funeral parlour business, Kinney president Steve Ross had rapidly built the Kinney company into a profitable conglomerate with interests that included comic publishing, the Ashley-Famous talent agency, parking lots and cleaning services. Following the takeover, Warners&#x27; music group briefly adopted the &#x27;umbrella&#x27; name Kinney Music, because U.S. anti-trust laws at the time prevented the three labels from trading as one.

Ross was primarily focused on rebuilding the company&#x27;s ailing movie division and was happy to defer to the advice of the managers of the company&#x27;s record labels, since he knew that they were generating most of the group&#x27;s profits. Ertegun&#x27;s campaign against Maitland began in earnest that summer. Atlantic had agreed to help Warner Bros. in its efforts to establish its labels overseas, beginning with its soon-to-be-established Warner Bros. subsidiary in Australia, but when Warner executive Phil Rose arrived in Australia, he discovered that just one week earlier Atlantic had signed a new four-year distribution deal with a rival local label, Festival Records (owned by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Limited). Mike Maitland complained bitterly to Kinney executive Ted Ashley, but to no avail – by this time Ertegun was poised to make his move against Maitland.

As he had with Hyman, Ertegun urged Steve Ross to extend Mo Ostin and Joe Smith&#x27;s contracts, a recommendation Ross was happy to accept. Ostin however had received overtures from other companies (including the aforementioned offers from MGM and ABC) and when he met with Ertegun in January 1970 and was offered Maitland&#x27;s job, he was unwilling to re-sign immediately. In response, Ertegun broadly hinted that Maitland&#x27;s days were numbered and that he, Ertegun, was about to take over the recording division.

Unlike the Warner/Reprise executives, Atlantic&#x27;s execs the Ertegun brothers (Ahmet and Neshui) and Wexler owned stock in Kinney.

Ostin was understandably concerned that, if he accepted the position, the Warner Bros. staff would feel that he had stabbed Maitland in the back, but his attorney convinced him that Maitland&#x27;s departure was inevitable, regardless of whether or not he accepted the post (succinctly advising him, &quot;Don&#x27;t be a schmuck&quot;). On Sunday January 25, Ted Ashley went to Maitland&#x27;s house to tell him he had been dismissed, and Maitland declined the offer of a job at the movie studio. One week later, Mo Ostin was named as the new President of Warner Bros. Records, with Joe Smith as his executive vice-president. Ertegun nominally remained the head of Atlantic, but since both Ostin and Smith owed their new positions to him, Ertegun was now the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Warner music division. Ertegun was given the formal title of executive vice-president-Music Group. Maitland moved to MCA Records later that year and successfully consolidated MCA&#x27;s labels, which he couldn&#x27;t do at Warner.

===1970s===
During the 1970s, the Kinney group built up a commanding position in the music industry. In 1970, Kinney bought Elektra Records and its sister label Nonesuch Records (founded by Jac Holzman in 1950) for $10 million, bringing in leading rock acts, including the Doors, Tim Buckley, and Love, and its historically significant folk archive, along with the successful budget Western classical-music label Nonesuch Records.

The purchase of Elektra-Nonesuch brought a rich back catalogue of folk music as well as the renowned Nonesuch catalogue of classical and world music. Elektra founder Jac Holzman ran the label under Warners for two years, but by that time, he was by his own admission &quot;burnt out&quot; after twenty years in the business. Kinney president Steve Ross subsequently appointed Holzman as part of a seven-person &quot;brain trust&quot; tasked with investigating opportunities presented by new technologies, a role Holzman was eager to accept. The same year, the group established its first overseas offices in Canada and Australia. By that time the &quot;Seven Arts&quot; moniker was dropped from the Warner Bros. name. Warner Bros. also founded the Casablanca Records subsidiary, headed by Neil Bogart; but several years later Casablanca became independent from Warner Bros.

====Warner-Elektra-Atlantic and worldwide distribution====

With the Elektra acquisition, the next step was forming an in-house distribution arm for the co-owned labels. By this time, Warner-Reprise&#x27;s frustrations with its current distributors had reached breaking point; Joe Smith (then executive vice-president of Warner Bros.) recalled that the Grateful Dead were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums. These circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the group&#x27;s in-house distribution arm, initially called . By late 1972, US anti-trust laws had changed and the company was renamed Warner-Elektra-Atlantic, WEA for short, which was renamed Warner Music in 1991 (the word &quot;group&quot; was added after the formation of AOL Time Warner in 2001).

WEA was an early champion of heavy metal rock music. Several such bands, including three major British pioneers Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, were all signed to WEA&#x27;s labels, at least in the United States. Among the earliest American metal acts to be signed to WEA were Alice Cooper, Montrose, and Van Halen.

Up to this point the Kinney-owned record companies had relied on licensing deals with overseas record labels to manufacture, distribute and promote its products in other countries; concurrent with the establishment of its new distribution arm, the company now began establishing subsidiaries in the other major markets, beginning with the creation of Warner Bros. Records Australia in 1970, soon followed by branch offices in the UK, Europe and Japan. In July 1971, the new in-house distribution company was incorporated as Warner-Elektra-Atlantic Distributing Corp. (WEA) and branch offices were established in eight major US cities; Joel Friedman a one-time &quot;Billboard&quot; writer who had been the head of Warner&#x27;s advertising/merchandising division in its early years, was appointed to head WEA&#x27;s US domestic division, and Ahmet Ertegun&#x27;s brother Nesuhi was appointed to oversee its international operations. Neshui Ertegun, originally a Turkish native like his brother, displayed a global perspective and independence from its U.S. counterpart by successfully promoting international acts in their target markets worldwide. Ertegun headed WEA International until his retirement in 1987. A &quot;de facto&quot; committee of three senior marketing executives—Dave Glew from Atlantic, Ed Rosenblatt from Warner Bros. and Mel Posner from Elektra—oversaw the integration of each label&#x27;s marketing and distribution through the new division, but each label continued to operate totally independently in A&amp;R matters and also applied their own expertise in marketing and advertising.

On July 1, 1971, following the pattern set by similar joint ventures in Canada and Australia, the Warner labels entered into a partnership with the British arm of CBS Records to press and distribute Warner-Reprise product in the United Kingdom, although this was undertaken as a cooperative venture rather than a formally incorporated business partnership. The &quot;Billboard&quot; article that reported the new arrangement also noted that, despite their intense competition in the US market, CBS continued to press Warner-Reprise recordings in the US. However the new UK arrangement was a major blow to Warner&#x27;s previous British manufacturer Pye Records, for whom Warner-Reprise had been their largest account. With the scheduled addition of the UK rights to the Atlantic catalogue, which would revert to Kinney in early 1972, &quot;Billboard&quot; predicted that the Warner-CBS partnership would have a 25–30% share of the UK music market.

In April 1971, thanks mainly to the influence of Ahmet Ertegun, the Kinney group announced a major coup with its acquisition of the worldwide rights to the Rolling Stones&#x27; new label Rolling Stones Records, following the expiration of the band&#x27;s contract with British Decca (then separate from the American label) and the acrimonious end to their business relationship with their former manager Allen Klein. Under the terms of the deal, Atlantic subsidiary Atco would distribute the Stones&#x27; recordings in the US, with other territories mainly handled by Warner Bros. international divisions.

One of Kinney&#x27;s wisest investments was Fleetwood Mac. The band signed with Reprise in the early 1970s after relocating to the US, and the label supported the group through numerous lineup changes and several lean years during which the band&#x27;s records sold relatively poorly, although they remained a popular concert attraction. Ironically, after the group&#x27;s transfer to Warner Bros. in 1975 and the recruitment of new members Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, the group scored a major international hit with the single &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and consolidated with the best selling albums &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, &quot;Rumours&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot;.

====Warner Communications (1972–1990)====
Due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations, Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as National Kinney Corporation) and changed its name to Warner Communications Inc.

In 1972, the Warner group acquired another rich prize, David Geffen&#x27;s Asylum Records. The $7 million purchase brought in several acts that proved crucial to WEA&#x27;s subsequent success, including Linda Ronstadt, the Eagles, Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell, and later Warren Zevon. On the downside, however, it was rumored that Warner was soon concerned about its possible liability under the California State Labor Code because of Geffen&#x27;s questionable status as both the manager of most of the Asylum acts and the head of the record label to which they were signed. The sale included the Asylum Records label and its recordings, as well as Geffen&#x27;s lucrative music publishing assets and the interests in the royalties of some of the artists managed by Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts. Geffen accepted a five-year contract with WCI and turned over his 75% share in the Geffen-Roberts management company to Roberts and Warner paid Geffen and Roberts 121,952 common shares worth $4,750,000 at the time of the sale, plus $400,000 in cash and a further $1.6 million in promissory notes convertible to common stock.

Although it seemed a lucrative deal at the time, Geffen soon had reason to regret it. Uncharacteristically, he had greatly underestimated the value of his assets—within Asylum&#x27;s first year as a Warner subsidiary, albums by Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles alone had earned more than the entire value of the Asylum sale. Geffen&#x27;s discomfort was compounded by the fact that, within six months of the sale, the value of his volatile Warner shares had plummeted from $4.5 million to just $800,000. He appealed to Steve Ross to intervene, and as part of a make-good deal, Ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years. Acting on Jac Holzman&#x27;s suggestion that Kinney should take Asylum from Atlantic and merge it with Elektra, Ross then appointed Geffen to run the new combined label.

In 1977, Warner Bros. Music, led by president Ed Silvers, formed Pacific Records for their composers and distributed (appropriately) by Atlantic Records. Alan O&#x27;Day was the first artist signed to the label, and the first release was &quot;Undercover Angel&quot;. The song, which he described as a &quot;nocturnal novelette&quot;, was released in February 1977. Within a few months it had become No. 1 in the country, and has sold approximately two million copies. It was also a hit in Australia, reaching No. 9 on the Australian Singles Chart. &quot;Undercover Angel&quot; also landed O&#x27;Day in an exclusive club as one of only a handful of writers/performers to pen a No. 1 hit for themselves and a No. 1 for another artist.

New signings in the late 1970s placed WEA in a strong position for the 1980s. A deal with Seymour Stein&#x27;s Sire Records label (which Warner Bros. Records later took over) brought in several major punk rock and new wave acts including the Pretenders, the Ramones and Talking Heads and, most importantly, rising star Madonna; Elektra signed the Cars and Warner Bros. signed Prince, giving WEA several of the biggest-selling acts of the decade.

WEA&#x27;s labels also distributed a number of otherwise independent labels. For example, Warner Bros. distributed Straight Records, DiscReet Records, Bizarre Records, Bearsville Records, and Geffen Records (the latter was sold to MCA in 1990). Atlantic Records distributed Swan Song Records. In 1975, WEA scored a major coup by signing a distribution agreement with Island Records, which only covered the United States and select other countries. For the next 14 years (initially with Warner Bros. until 1982, then with Atlantic afterward), WEA would distribute such artists as Bob Marley, U2, Robert Palmer, Anthrax, and Tom Waits. This relationship ended when Island was sold to PolyGram in 1989.

===1980s===

A name-only unit appearing exclusively in the copyright, WEA International Inc., was created in early 1982, to handle distribution of all Warner Bros., Elektra, and Atlantic (all these namings accounting for the initials in the title &quot;WEA&quot;) releases for international countries.

A proposed 1983 international merger between PolyGram and WEA was forbidden by both the US Federal Trade Commission and West Germany&#x27;s cartel office, so PolyGram&#x27;s half-owner Philips then purchased a further 40% of the company from its partner Siemens, and bought the remaining shares in 1987. The same year, PolyGram divested its film and publishing operations, closed PolyGram Pictures and sold Chappell Music to Warner for US$275 million.

In 1976, Warner gained a brief early lead in digital media when it purchased the Atari computer company. WCI also blazed the trail in visual music with MTV, which it created and co-owned in partnership with American Express as Warner-Amex (which also ran the company&#x27;s cable television systems, including the interactive TV experiment QUBE, which MTV spun-off from). By 1984, however, Warner rapidly divested many of these recent acquisitions, including Atari, The Franklin Mint, Panavision, MTV Networks and a cosmetics business; this was due in large part to the 1983 video game crash, which Atari had played a central role in, and the resulting loss of profits and investor confidence (Warner-Amex&#x27;s cable system expansion also contributed to Warner&#x27;s financial downturn).

WEA formed WEA Manufacturing in 1986. In 1988 WEA took over the German classical label Teldec and the British Magnet label.

In 1989, it was announced that Warner Communications was to merge with Time Inc. to form Time Warner, a transaction that was completed in 1990. Following the merger, WEA continued acquiring independent labels, buying CGD Records (Italy) and MMG Records (Japan) in 1989.

===1990s===
Through the 1990s, Time Warner was the largest media company in the world, with assets in excess of US$20 billion and annual revenues in the billions of dollars; by 1991, Warner&#x27;s music labels were generating sales valued at more than US$3 billion, with operating profits of $550 million, and by 1995, its music division dominated the US music industry with a 22% share of the domestic market. Acquisitions and corporate changes within the Warner group of labels continued after the Time Warner merger—in 1990, WEA purchased French label Carrere Records, in 1992 it bought the leading French classical label Erato, and in 1993, it bought the Spanish DRO Records, Hungary&#x27;s Magneoton label, the Swedish Telegram Records, Brazil&#x27;s Continental Records and Finnish label Fazer Musiikki. WEA was renamed Warner Music in 1991.

Atlantic launched two new subsidiary labels in the early 1990s: East West Records and Interscope Records. In 1995, East West absorbed Atco Records and was eventually folded into Elektra Records. In 1996, after causing much controversy, Interscope was purchased by MCA Music Entertainment.

During 1992, Warner Music faced one of the most serious public-relations crises in its history when a major controversy erupted over the provocative Warner Bros. recording &quot;Cop Killer&quot; from the self-titled album by Body Count, a heavy metal/rap fusion band led by Ice-T. Unfortunately for Warner, the song (which mentioned the Rodney King case) was issued just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with King&#x27;s beating, which sparked the 1992 Los Angeles Riots and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight. Complaints escalated over the summer—conservative police associations called for a boycott of Time Warner products, politicians including President George H. W. Bush denounced the label for releasing the song, Warner executives received death threats, Time Warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the New Zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there. Although Ice-T later voluntarily reissued &quot;Body Count&quot; without &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, the furor seriously rattled Warner Music and in January 1993 the label made an undisclosed deal releasing Ice-T from his contract and returning the &quot;Body Count&quot; master tapes to him.

Also in 1992, the Rhino Records label signed a distribution agreement with Atlantic Records and Time Warner Entertainment bought a 50% stake in the Rhino Records label. The distribution agreement allowed Rhino to begin reissuing recordings from Atlantic&#x27;s back catalogue.

In 1994, Canadian beverage giant Seagram bought a 14.5% stake in Time Warner, and the Warner publishing division — now called Warner/Chappell Music – acquired CPP/Belwin, becoming the world&#x27;s largest owner of song copyrights and the world&#x27;s largest publisher of printed music. In 1996, Time Warner Entertainment made another dramatic expansion of its media holdings, taking over the Turner Broadcasting System, which by then included the Turner cable TV network, CNN and the screen production houses Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema, acquisitions that brought huge profits into the Warner Group thanks to content assets like &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and the highly successful &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy.

By the early 1990s, senior Warner staff like Ostin and Waronker had remained in their positions for several decades—a highly unusual situation in the American music industry—but the death of Steve Ross destabilized the Time Warner hierarchy, and over the next few years the music group was increasingly disrupted by internal power struggles, leading to a string of major executive upheavals in 1994–95, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a virtual civil war&quot;.

The central conflict was between Mo Ostin and Warner Music Group chairman Robert Morgado, who had joined the Warner group in the late 1980s. Because of his political background (he had been the chief-of-staff to former New York governor Hugh L. Carey) and his lack of music industry experience — especially compared to the widely revered Ostin—Morgado was viewed as an outsider at Warner. Nevertheless, he gained favour with Ross and Levin and was promoted in 1985 to oversee the Warner international music division after helping the company slash costs in its computer game sector.

Since his appointment as head of WBR, Ostin had always reported directly to Steve Ross and his successor Gerald Levin, but in late 1993, when Ostin&#x27;s contract came up for renewal, Morgado asserted his authority, insisting that Ostin should now report directly to him. The tensions between them reached boiling point in July 1994 when Morgado appointed former Atlantic chief Doug Morris to head the Warner Music Group in the US, a decision that many saw as a deliberate move to hasten the departure of Ostin and Elektra head Robert Krasnow. Morgado&#x27;s new structure was announced in August 1994 and Bob Krasnow resigned from Elektra the next day. Within days, after more than 30 years with the Warner music group and more than 20 years as president and chairman of Warner Bros. Records, Ostin announced he would not renew his current contract and would leave Warners when it expired on December 31, 1994. There was more negative publicity the following month, when leading Elektra act Metallica launched a lawsuit against the label, seeking a release from their contract and ownership of their master tapes, and claiming that Morgado had refused to honor a deal they had worked out with Krasnow before he quit.

Ostin&#x27;s departure marked a seismic shift in the corporate culture at WBR and the news was greeted with dismay by industry insiders and the many artists whose careers he had helped to nurture. Lenny Waronker had agreed to take over as WBR chairman and CEO but in October 1994 he announced that he would not be taking up the position; he initially said that he would remain as President of WBR, but by this time there was already widespread speculation that he would leave, and he did so soon afterwards. The following year he re-joined Ostin and son Michael as joint head of the newly launched DreamWorks label.

Beginning in August 1994, Morgado alienated Morris by his clumsy handling of Warner&#x27;s relationship with Interscope Records, the successful label founded by Ted Field and Jimmy Iovine and part-owned by Warner. Morgado had resisted making a decision about increasing the Warner stake in Interscope, which encouraged other companies to make overtures to the label; in response, Morgado threatened to send cease-and-desist notices to executives at several record companies, demanding that they stop approaching Interscope with buyout offers, a move that reportedly infuriated Iovine.

By late 1994, Morris was gaining the upper hand over his rival and media reports claimed that Morris had moved to settle with Metallica, offering a deal that was reportedly even more generous than the one they had worked out with Krasnow. Morgado now faced a showdown with Morris, who felt he was not being allowed to run WMG as he saw fit. In October 1994, Morris and 11 other Warner executives &quot;staged an unprecedented insurrection that nearly paralyzed the world&#x27;s largest record company&quot;. This led to a climactic meeting between Morris and Gerald Levin in late October, at which Morris reportedly threatened to quit if he had to continue to report to Morgado.

Morgado gave in to the demand that Morris be granted autonomy to run the North American operations and he was forced to upgrade Morris&#x27;s position from chief operating officer to Chief Executive of Warner Music Group (US); Morris promptly named Danny Goldberg, former president of Atlantic Records, to run WBR in defiance of Morgado, who had a different candidate in mind and Levin also reduced Morgado&#x27;s power to oversee Warner&#x27;s mail-order record club division and its international operations. Morris then brought in Sylvia Rhone and Seymour Stein to stabilize Elektra, settled the Metallica lawsuit and persuaded Levin to purchase an additional 25% of Interscope, although this initiative proved short-lived.

The power struggle between Morgado and Morris reached a dramatic climax in May 1995 when Morgado was asked to resign by Gerald Levin, following a welter of complaints from executives at the three major Warner Music labels, who said that Morgado was undermining Morris&#x27;s authority and damaging Warner&#x27;s reputation among performers. Morgado was immediately replaced by HBO chairman Michael J. Fuchs, but the corporate upheavals did not end there; in late June 1995 Fuchs abruptly dismissed Doug Morris, saying that Morris had been &quot;leading a campaign to destabilize Warner Music in an effort to seize control of the company&quot;. As Morris&#x27;s strongest ally, Danny Goldberg was also under threat; he was initially told that he could stay on as President of WBR as long as he refrained from office politics and concentrate on the day-to-day management of the label, but he resigned as President of Warner Bros. Records soon after to pursue &quot;other interests&quot;, and was replaced by WBR vice-chairman Russ Thyret.

That August saw yet another resignation, that of Mel Lewinter, then president and COO of Warner Music&#x27;s domestic music operations; while Lewinter being an ally of Morris played a role in the former&#x27;s ouster, speculation ran rampant about it also having to do with a internal investigation into improper sales practices (involving tens of thousands of CDs being stolen from Atlantic by sales manager Nick Maria, then being secretly resold to retailers; the profits were divided between the retailers and the Atlantic employees involved), which had earlier caused 10 executives (including Maria) to lose their jobs amid the investigation. Lewinter subsequently sued Warner Music for wrongful termination.

Despite early success with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, and Morris&#x27;s decision to increase Warner&#x27;s stake to 50%, by the mid-1990s Interscope Records was being seen as a liability for the Warner group. Time Warner&#x27;s board and investors had already been bruised by the damaging 1992 &quot;Cop Killer&quot; controversy and now they were faced with renewed criticism about the gangsta rap genre, in which Interscope&#x27;s associate imprint Death Row Records was a key label. In mid-1995, Time Warner refused to distribute the Interscope album &quot;Dogg Food&quot; by Tha Dogg Pound, forcing the label to seek outside distribution, and late in the year TW sold its stake in Death Row back to co-owners Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field and soon after it sold off its share in Interscope to MCA Music Entertainment.

The upheaval at Warner was beneficial to its rivals, who picked up valuable executives who had left Warner. Goldberg moved over to Mercury Records; Morris joined MCA Music Entertainment Group and led its reorganization into Universal Music Group, now the world&#x27;s largest record company. In November 1995, Fuchs was himself sacked by Levin, leaving the company with a reported US$60 million &quot;golden parachute&quot;, and Time Warner co-chairmen Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel took over the running of the music division.

In 1998, Seagram boss Edgar Bronfman Jr. held talks aimed at merging Seagram&#x27;s Universal Music, headed by Morris, with the venerable British recording company EMI, but the discussions came to nothing; Bronfman then oversaw Universal&#x27;s takeover by Vivendi. WEA meanwhile continued to expand its publishing empire, buying a 90% stake in the Italian recording and music publishing group Nuova Fonit Cetra.

Also in 1998, Time Warner Entertainment bought the remaining 50% of the Rhino Records label they did not own. The Rhino Records retail store in Los Angeles was not included. Rhino then began reissuing the back catalogues of the Warner/Reprise and Elektra/Asylum labels. In 1999, Rhino launched Rhino Handmade, which released limited-edition reissues of lesser-known but still-significant recordings from the WEA labels.

===2000s===

In 2000, Time Warner Entertainment merged with leading American internet service provider AOL to create AOL Time Warner. The new conglomerate again tried (and failed) to acquire EMI, and subsequent discussions about the takeover of BMG stalled, with Bertelsmann eventually offloading BMG into a joint venture with Sony. In 2002, AOLTW further consolidated its hold over the publishing industry, buying 50% of music publisher Deston Songs from Edel AG. By the early 2000s, however, the effects of the dot-com crash had eroded AOL&#x27;s profits and stock value, and in 2003 the Time Warner board sidelined its under-performing partner by dropping &quot;AOL&quot; from its business name.

As a result of the CD price fixing issue, a settlement was reached in 2002 involving the music publishers and distributors Sony Music, WMG, Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI Music, and Universal Music. In restitution for price fixing they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine and distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups but admitted no wrongdoing.
Looking to reduce its debt load, Time Warner — the corporate successor to Warner Communications — sold Warner Music Group in 2004 to a group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. for US$2.6 billion. This spinoff was completed on February 27, 2004. In the 2004 transition to independent ownership, WMG hired record industry heavyweight Lyor Cohen from Universal Music Group (the result of the merger between the PolyGram and MCA label families) to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance. Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery) no longer retains any ownership in WMG, though it had the option to reacquire up to 20% of WMG for three years following the closing of the transaction. WMG did, however, have a royalty-free license to use the Warner Bros. shield for 15 years, as well as the old Warner Communications logo as WMG&#x27;s main logo. With the expiration of the royalty-free license in May 2019, Warner Bros. Records (which became separate from the eponymous film studio after the spinoff) was renamed Warner Records and a new logo was introduced to replace the WB shield.

Once free of Time Warner, WMG began cutting costs by offloading loss-making or low-earning divisions. Like its rival EMI, Warner reacted to the growth of the digital music market by making a historic change, moving out of record production by closing or selling off disc-pressing plants, particularly in territories such as the US and the Netherlands, where production costs are high. The US manufacturing operations were sold to Cinram in 2003, before the purchase from Time Warner.

In 2005, the Miami-based Warner Bros. Publications, which printed and distributed a broad selection of sheet music, books, educational material, orchestrations, arrangements and tutorials, was sold to Alfred Music Publishing, although the sale excluded the print music business of WMG&#x27;s Word Music (church hymnals, choral music and associated instrumental music).

On May 3, 2006, WMG apparently rejected a buyout offer from EMI. Then WMG offered to buy EMI and it also rejected the offer. In August 2007, EMI was purchased by Terra Firma Capital Partners. Talk of a possible WMG acquisition of EMI was fanned once again in 2009 after WMG executed a bond offering for $1.1 billion, which brought to light WMG&#x27;s relatively strong financial position, which was contrasted with the weakened and debt-laden state of EMI. The same year WMG acquired Rykodisc and Roadrunner Records.

In September 2006, after pulling its content from the service earlier in the year, WMG entered into a new licensing deal with the video streaming service YouTube. Under the deal, WMG would be able to handle advertising sales for its artists&#x27; music videos on the service (as well as monetize user-created videos that include WMG-owned recordings) and partake in revenue sharing with YouTube, and also collaborate with YouTube on building a &quot;premium&quot; user experience for its content and associated channels.

On December 27, 2007, Warner announced that it would sell digital music without digital rights management through AmazonMP3, making it the third major label to do so. In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that WMG&#x27;s Atlantic Records became the first major record label to generate more than half of its music sales in the U.S. from digital products. In 2010, &quot;Fast Company&quot; magazine detailed the company&#x27;s transformation efforts in its recorded music division, where it has redefined the relationships it has with artists and diversified its revenue streams through its expansion into growing areas of the music business.

In 2008, WMG and several other major labels made investments in the new music streaming service Spotify.

Due to licensing deal negotiations between Google and WMG in 2008, music video content licensed by WMG was removed from YouTube. In 2009, it was announced that the companies had reached a deal, and videos would be re-added to YouTube. As of 2017, WMG had extended its deal with YouTube.

In 2009, Warner Music took over its South-East Asian and Korean distribution of EMI audio and video products, including newer domestic releases, which was announced in September 2008. The two companies already enjoyed a successful partnership in India, the Middle East and North Africa, where EMI marketed and distributed Warner Music&#x27;s physical product from 2005.

=== 2010s ===

WMG formed a partnership with MTV Networks in June 2010 that allowed MTVN to exclusively sell ads on WMG&#x27;s premium content; in turn, views of WMG videos would be counted as views for MTVN.

In May 2011, WMG announced its sale to Access Industries, a conglomerate controlled by Soviet-born billionaire Len Blavatnik, for US$3.3 billion in cash. The price represented $8.25 a share; a 34% premium over the six-month-before average price, and a 4% premium over the day-before price. Overall, this was a drop of over 70% since 2007. According to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, the deal ended a three-month sale process in which as many as 10 bidders, including Los Angeles-based brothers Tom and Alec Gores, and Sony Corp. vied for the company. Blavatnik was a shareholder and former board member of WMG at the time of the purchase announcement. The purchase was completed on July 20, 2011, and the company became private. In August 2011, Stephen Cooper became CEO of Warner Music Group replacing Edgar Bronfman Jr., who became chairman of the company. Bronfman Jr. stepped down as chairman of the company on January 31, 2012.

==== EMI label purchase and divestment ====
In 2013, Warner acquired longtime EMI division Parlophone, along with EMI Classics and some regional EMI operations, from UMG for £487 million (around $764.54 million US). This news came after reports that WMG was in talks to acquire EMI&#x27;s recorded music business, which was eventually bought by Universal. The European Commission approved the sale in May 2013, and Warner closed the acquisition on July 1. The EMI Classics roster was absorbed into Warner Classics and the Virgin Classics roster was absorbed into the revived Erato Records. In November 2013, WMG paid Universal an additional €30 million for Parlophone, following an arbitration process in respect to the original sale price.

In order to accommodate a deal made with IMPALA and the Merlin Network when it acquired Parlophone, WMG agreed to offload over $200 million worth in catalogues to various independent labels. The labels had until February 28, 2014, to inform Warner Music of which artist catalogues they were interested in acquiring, and said artists had to approve of the divestments. By March 2015, over 140 independent labels had placed bids on over 11,000 Warner Music artists valuing $6 billion, far higher than expectations. In March 2016, Curb Records acquired Warner Music&#x27;s 80% share of Word Entertainment, though WMG would continue to distribute the label. In April 2016, the first confirmed sale of a Warner Music artist was the back catalogue of English band Radiohead to XL Recordings. As of the end of May 2016, WMG had sold the catalogue of Chrysalis Records to Blue Raincoat Music, as well as the catalogues of ten other artists, including Everything But the Girl, Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel, and Lucinda Williams. In September 2016, Nettwerk acquired the rights to albums by Guster and Airbourne from Warner Music.

In April 2017, Warner Music agreed to sell the independent distributor Zebralution back to its founders. On June 1, 2017, WMG divested additional artists, including the catalogues of Hot Chip and Buzzcocks to Domino Recording Company; Tom Waits to Anti-; and Howard Jones, Dinosaur Jr., and Kim Wilde to Cherry Red Records. Cosmos Music Group acquired the rights to Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson, while Neil Finn&#x27;s catalogue moved to his Lester Records label. On July 6, 2017, Because Music acquired 10 French artists, most of London Records&#x27; back catalogue, and The Beta Band, while Concord Music acquired albums by Jewel, Sérgio Mendes, R.E.M., the Traveling Wilburys, and several rock, blues, and jazz artists. In August 2017, The Lemonheads and The Groundhogs were transferred to Fire Records. In October 2017, Strut Records acquired albums by Patrice Rushen and Miriam Makeba.

In November 2017, T.I.&#x27;s catalogue was sold to Cinq Music Group. Woah Dad! (and later Round Hill Music) acquired over 20 catalogues, including those of Ziggy Marley, Estelle, and several Swedish artists. while Believe Digital acquired the rights to EMF and several French artists. In April 2018, RT Industries acquired seven catalogues from WMG, including Sugar Ray and Fat Joe. In May 2018, New State Music acquired the catalogues of Paul Oakenfold and Dirty Vegas. Other winning bidders included The Echo Label (Thomas Dolby, Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Supergrass), Nature Sounds (Roy Ayers), The state51 Conspiracy (Donovan), PIAS Recordings (Failure), Evolution Music Group (Mr. Big), Playground Music Scandinavia (Olle Adolphson), Metal Blade Records (King Diamond), Snapper Music (Mansun) and its sublabel Kscope (Porcupine Tree), Phoenix Music International (Lulu), Kobalt Label Services (HIM), and Tommy Boy Music (which reclaimed its pre-2002 catalogue and the rights to Brand Nubian, Handsome Boy Modeling School&#x27;s &quot;White People&quot;, Grand Puba, and Club Nouveau). All the labels had to complete their deals by September 30, 2017; though a few announcements came after that date.

==== Expansion ====
In October 2012, WMG became one of the last major labels to sign with Google&#x27;s music service. It was also one of the last labels to reach an agreement with Spotify.

In June 2013, WMG expanded into Russia by acquiring Gala Records, best known as the longtime distributor of EMI. Later that year, Warner Music Russia agreed to locally distribute releases by Disney Music Group and Sony Music. Later that year, WMG closed a deal with Clear Channel Media that saw its artists paid for terrestrial radio play for the first time. Clear Channel would get preferential rates for streaming songs through its iHeartRadio service and other online platforms. It was believed that the agreement would put pressure on other big labels, including Sony and Universal, to reach similar deals.

In 2017, WMG formed a TV and film division, Warner Music Entertainment, led by former MGM executive Charlie Cohen. In March 2020, it hired Kate Shepherd, the former head of entertainment at Ridley Scott Creative Group. This division paired with Imagine Entertainment on a Nat Geo limited series &quot;Genius: Aretha&quot;, which led to a co-producing and co-financing agreement for a music slate in July 2020.

In February 2022, Warner announced acquisition of controlling interest in a South India based distribution label Divo Music.

==== International labels ====
On November 14, 2013, it was determined that Warner Music&#x27;s releases in the Middle East would be distributed by Universal Music as a result of the integration of EMI&#x27;s branch in said region. Sony Music India would assume distribution of WMG in India, Sri Lanka, and rest of SAARC countries except Bangladesh. In December 2013, Warner Music began operating the wholly owned South African subsidiary after acquiring the Gallo&#x27;s stakes that it did not own. In April 2014, WMG announced that it had acquired Chinese record label Gold Typhoon.

In April 2016, WMG agreed to distribute most of BMG Rights Management&#x27;s catalogue worldwide through Warner&#x27;s ADA division, though a few frontline releases would remain distributed by other labels.

Around the end of May 2016, WMG acquired the Indonesian label PT Indo Semar Sakti. Warner Music UK launched The Firepit in May 2016, a creative content division, innovation centre and recording studio located at their United Kingdom headquarters in London. On June 2, 2016, Warner Music acquired Swedish compilation label X5 Music Group.

In September 2017, one week after acquiring American rock label Artery Recordings, WMG acquired the Dutch EDM label Spinnin&#x27; Records. In February 2018, Warner Music launched a division in the Middle East, based in Beirut, Lebanon. Warner Music Middle East will cover 17 markets across North Africa and the Middle East.

In January 2019, WMG signed a Turkish distribution deal with Doğan Media Group, which will represent the record company for physical and digital releases.

In May 2019, Warner Music Finland acquired the hip-hop label Monsp Records. In July 2019, Warner Music Slovakia acquired Forza Music, which owned the former state-owned label Opus Records. In February 2021, WMG purchased a minority stake in the Saudi Arabian record label Rotana Records.

==== Elektra Music Group and further investments ====
In July 2017, Warner Music acquired the concert discovery website Songkick. In May, news media reported that Warner Music led an investment round in Hooch, a popular subscription-lifestyle application including blockchain-based payment technology.

Announced on June 18, 2018, but effective on October 1, 2018, Warner Music Group launched Elektra Music Group as a stand-alone staffed music company with the labels Elektra Records, Fueled By Ramen, Low Country Sound, Black Cement, and Roadrunner Records. A handful of major artists would transfer from Atlantic. This returned the group back to the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic (WEA) triad that had marked the original company organization for decades.

On August 2, 2018, Warner Music announced that it acquired Uproxx Media Group and its properties (except for BroBible, which will continue to publish independently) for an undisclosed sum, although Uproxx has raised around $43m (£33m) from previous investment, which provides some sense of the firm&#x27;s valuation. In September 2018, WMG acquired German merchandise retailer EMP Merchandising from Sycamore Partners for $180 million.

In October 2018, Warner Music Group announced the launch of the WMG Boost seed venture fund. Several labels of Warner Music moved into the Los Angeles Arts District in 2019 where the company had purchased a former Ford Motor Company assembly plant.

=== 2020s ===
On March 9, 2020, WMG expanded to India, creating the Warner Music India unit based in Mumbai and handling business in other countries for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Jay Mehta (former executive of Sony Music India) would take change of the unit as the managing director in April. Before the division&#x27;s foundation, Warner&#x27;s releases were distributed in the country by EMI/Virgin Records (India) Pvt., and by Sony Music India since EMI&#x27;s breakup.

In August 2020, Warner Music acquired Tel Aviv- and New York-based IMGN Media in a deal worth approximately $100 million. In September 2020, WMG acquired the online hip-hop magazine HipHopDX. In 2021, WMG invested an eight figure sum into global multiplayer gaming platform Roblox. This followed WMG artist Ava Max&#x27;s live performance on the platform the previous year.

Warner Music Group had planned an IPO of current investors&#x27; stock in March 2020, but withdrew its IPO just before the March 2 kick off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 3, 2020, it completed its IPO on Nasdaq, raising almost $2 billion with a valuation of $12.75 billion, making WMG once again a publicly traded company after previously going private in 2011. On June 12, 2020, Tencent announced that it had purchased 10.4% of Warner Music&#x27;s Class A shares, or 1.6% of the company. Tencent already owns 10% of shares of WMG&#x27;s largest competitor, Universal Music Group, which it acquired from Vivendi in March. Also, this makes Sony Music the only major music company not directly owned in any percentage by a Chinese company (it is wholly owned by the Japanese conglomerate Sony).

In December 2020, WMG signed a partnership deal with TikTok to provide music to their platform for users to use for their content.

In January 2023, Stephen Cooper was succeeded by Robert Kyncl as CEO of WMG.

In July 2023, Warner Music Group formed a partnership with Canva, the graphic design platform, to add commercial music to Canva&#x27;s asset library and enable its customers to insert music clips to their designs. Also in July 2023, WMG made a music-licensing deal with TikTok which included licensing the Warner Recorded Music and Warner Chappell Music to the app, TikTok Music and TikTok&#x27;s Commercial Music Library.

In September 2023, WMG opened a new creative hub in Berlin. Later in October 2023, Warner Music Group launched a new creative hub in Amsterdam to house Benelux units and Spinnin&#x27; Records.

==Arts Music==
On June 6, 2017, Warner Music Group launched a new division, Arts Music, Inc., which transcends the pop mainstream and consists of labels for classical, jazz, children&#x27;s music, and music scores from films/movies and musical theaters. The division was placed under president Kevin Gore, who reported to Eliah Seton, President of ADA Worldwide, WMG&#x27;s independent distribution and services arm. At the same time, Warner Classics, including the Erato label, while remaining based in Paris and continuing under president Alain Lanceron, were transferred into the new division. Also, a joint venture with Sh-K-Boom/Ghostlight Records, the theatrical music company, was formed, with founder/president Kurt Deutsch being named as senior vice president of theatrical and catalog development for Warner/Chappell Music.

In November 2018, Arts Music signed a multi-year deal with Sesame Workshop to revive the Sesame Street Records label starting early 2019. In June 2019, WMG purchased First Night Record, a musical-theater cast recording company, and placed the company within Arts Music. On June 24, 2019, the division launched the licensed Cloudco Entertainment label with the release of the current &quot;Holly Hobbie&quot; theme song as a part of a multi-season deal. Build-A-Bear Workshop teamed up with Arts Music and Warner Chappell Music in July 2019 to partner on the Build-A-Bear label, with Patrick Hughes and Harvey Russell.

On May 1, 2020, toy manufacturer and entertainment company, Mattel, struck an agreement with Arts Music to become the exclusive distributor of its music catalogue. The agreement at the time was to make available hundreds of &quot;never-before-released&quot; and newly-released albums and singles for existing Mattel properties/brands for digital distribution, beginning with the launch of Thomas &amp; Friends&#x27; birthday album a week later on May 8. As a result, the soundtrack album to &quot;Monster High: Boo York, Boo York&quot; and other Mattel albums previously released under Universal Music Group through its film distribution agreement with Universal Pictures would be re-released under the pseudonym label: &quot;Mattel–Arts Music&quot; by ADA Worldwide.

==Music publishing==
Warner Chappell Music dates back to 1811 and the creation of Chappell &amp; Company, a sheet music and instrument merchant in London. In 1929, Jack L. Warner, president of Warner Bros. Pictures Inc., founded Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) to acquire music copyrights as a means of providing inexpensive music for films and, in 1987, Warner Bros.&#x27; corporate parent, Warner Communications, acquired Chappell &amp; Company from PolyGram. Its printed music operation, Warner Bros. Publications, was sold to Alfred Music on June 1, 2005.

Among the historic compositions of which the publishing rights are controlled by WMG are the works of Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. In the 1930s and 1940s, Chappell Music also ran a profitable orchestration division for Broadway musicals, with house arrangers of the caliber of Robert Russell Bennett, Don Walker, Ted Royal and Hans Spialek. Between them they had orchestrated about 90% of the productions seen up to late 1941.

<text>DVD-RAM (DVD Random Access Memory) is a DVD-based disc specification presented in 1996 by the DVD Forum, which specifies rewritable DVD-RAM media and the appropriate DVD writers. DVD-RAM media have been used in computers as well as camcorders and personal video recorders since 1998.

In May 2019, Panasonic, the only remaining manufacturer of DVD-RAM discs, announced that it would end production of DVD-RAM media by the end of that month, citing shrinking demand as the primary motivation. Panasonic made these discs under its own brand name and also under the Verbatim brand.

The &quot;RAM&quot; in its name is related to random-access memory that computers use as main memory, not in the technology but in sense that it can be used as a random-access memory unit rather than a sequential-access memory unit such as a magnetic tape drive.

==Format==
DVD-RAM works by means of phase change technology big back which was chosen instead of magneto-optical technology (an already existing rewritable solution at the time) because it doesn&#x27;t require a magnetic head and therefore it represented reduced complexity and costs. Phase change technology uses laser light to heat the surface of a phase changing alloy and allows it to go from a crystalline to an amorphous state and vice versa, therefore altering its optical reflectivity index. To change the recording material from a crystalline to an amorphous state, and back again a high or medium power laser light is used to control the rate of cooling of the phase changing alloy therefore establishing the final state. Encoding is done by means of difference in reflectivity of the alloy, a laser is pointed at the surface and the returned intensity signifies either a 1 or a 0.

DVD-RAM uses concentric tracks each divided into hard (factory originated) sectors, in contrast to traditional spiral recording found in other DVD and CD formats. A 12 cm (5&quot;) 4.7 GB disc is divided into 35 zones of tracks, with each zone having more sectors per track compared to the previous zone. This makes its data structuring very similar to that of hard drives and floppy disks. This means that usually DVD-RAMs are suitable to be accessed by the OS without any special software 

==Specification==
=== Recording speeds ===
Since the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin 2003 the specification is being marketed by the &quot;RAM Promotion Group&quot; (RAMPRG), built by Hitachi, Toshiba, Maxell, LG Electronics, Matsushita/Panasonic, Samsung, Lite-On and Teac. The specification distinguishes between:

* DVD-RAM version 1.0 (1997), recording speed 1x&lt;br&gt;– Defines discs with capacity of 2.58 GB per side (24 track zones) (see also: DVD Capacity)
* DVD-RAM version 2.0 (1999), recording speed 2x&lt;br&gt;– Defines discs with more common capacity of 4.7 GB per side (35 track zones)
* DVD-RAM version 2.1 (2000)&lt;br&gt;– Introduces 8-cm discs with capacity of 1.46 GB per side (14 track zones)
* DVD-RAM version 2.2 (2004) divides drives and discs into two classes due to breaking compatibility:&lt;br&gt; – Class 0, recording speed 2x/3x/5x&lt;br&gt; – Class 1, recording speed 6x/8x/12x/16x (DVD-RAM2)

Speeds more than 2x are defined by Optional Specifications (Nx-speed DVD-RAM):
* Rev. 1.0 (2002) - 3x-speed
* Rev. 2.0 (2004) - 5x-speed
* Rev. 3.0 (2005) - 6x-speed
* Rev. 4.0 (2005) - 8x-speed
* Rev. 5.0 (2005) - 12x-speed
* Rev. 6.0 (2005) - 16x-speed (never released)

=== Diameters ===
DVD-RAM discs can have 12 or 8 cm in diameter, around 5 or 3 inches respectively. The latter variant is mainly intended for camcorders that use DVD as storage media and also exists with capacities of 1.46 GB for a single-sided disc, 2.8 GB for a double-sided disc, and 5.6 GB for a dual-layer double sided disc, however, they are relatively uncommon.
DVD-RAMs were originally solely sold in disc caddy cartridges; recent DVD recorders can work with discs either with or without a cartridge, and many devices do not work with cartridges. Discs can be removed from cartridges for use with these drives (except with type 1 media, see table above).

=== Cartridge types ===
==Compatibility==
Many operating systems like the classic Mac OS (from Mac OS 8.6 up), macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows XP can use DVD-RAM directly, while earlier versions of Windows require separate device drivers or the program InCD.

Windows XP can only write directly to FAT32 formatted DVD-RAM discs. For UDF formatted discs, which are considered faster, a third-party UDF file system driver capable of writing or software such as InCD or DLA are required. Windows Vista and later can natively access and write to both FAT32 and UDF formatted DVD-RAM discs using mastered burning method or packet writing. Even though it is possible to use any file system one likes, very few perform well on DVD-RAM. This is because some file systems frequently overwrite data on the disc and the table of contents is contained at the start of the disc. Windows Vista (and later) implement the CPRM data protection and thus discs formatted under Windows XP (or earlier) have compatibility issues with Vista onwards (and vice versa).

The classic Mac OS up to 9.2 can read and write HFS, HFS+, FAT, and UDF formatted DVD-RAM discs directly. In Mac OS X (versions 10.0.x through 10.4.x) UDF-formatting of DVD-RAM is no longer supported, instead formatting and writing DVD-RAM is done in HFS+ format. (UDF support was re-implemented in 10.5 Leopard) (HFS and UFS should also be supported on older versions of Mac OS X that retain support for these file systems.)

Many DVD standalone players and recorders do not work with DVD-RAM. However, within &quot;RAMPRG&quot; (the DVD-RAM Promotion Group consisting of Hitachi, Toshiba, Maxell, LG Electronics, Matsushita/Panasonic, Samsung, Lite-On, Teac) there were a number of well-known manufacturers of standalone players, recorders, and camcorders that &quot;could&quot; use DVD-RAM. Panasonic, for instance, had a range of players and recorders which made full use of the advantages of DVD-RAM.

The last DVD-RAM Specification, DVD-RAM2 (also called RAM2 or Class 1), is not compatible with DVD drives that do not specifically allow reading DVD-RAM2 discs. DVD-RAM2 medium was brought to the market in Japan, but was not launched worldwide.

Some high end products such as IBM System p mainframes require DVD-RAM instead of DVD-RW.

Many half-height DVD Multi Recorder drives released between 2006 and 2010, including the TSSTcorp &quot;SH-S182/S183&quot; (2006) and &quot;SH-S203/TS-H653B&quot; (2007) have officially adapted support for 12× DVD-RAM speeds, while more recent DVD writers such as the &quot;SH-224DB&quot; (2013) and Blu-ray writers such as the &quot;LG BE16NU50&quot; (2016) have restricted the supported DVD-RAM writing speed to 5×.

The Nintendo Wii U can use DVD-RAM for extended storage over USB.

==Advantages==


* Long life — without physical damage, data is retained for an estimated 30 years. For this reason, it is used for archival storage of data.
* Can be rewritten over 100,000 times for the lowest write speed discs (DVD±RW can be rewritten approx. 1,000 times). Faster DVD-RAMs allow fewer rewrites (3x speed: 100,000, 5x speed: 10,000) , but still more than DVD+RW or DVD-RW. (These are theoretical numbers. In practice they could be smaller depending on the drive, the treatment of the disc and the file system.)
* Reliable writing of discs. Verification done in hardware by the drive, so post-write verification by software is unnecessary. Software verification is disabled in all current DVD Video Recorders.
* Disc defect management designed to safeguard data.
* DVD-burning software may not be required — discs can be used and accessed like a removable hard disk. Mac OS (8.6 or later) uses DVD-RAM directly. Windows XP uses DVD-RAM directly for FAT32-formatted discs only. Windows Vista is able to write directly to both FAT32- and UDF-formatted DVD-RAM discs from within Windows Explorer. Device drivers or other software are needed for earlier versions of Windows.
* Very fast access of small files on the disc.
* Small 2 KB disc block size wastes less space when writing small files.
* Finalization not necessary. For video recording use, other media such as DVD+RW (when used in DVD+VR mode) do not require a separate finalisation either as finalisation is automatic. The table of contents can be overwritten in this latter media.
* Media available with or without protective cartridges; can be used in the cartridge by many devices.
* In some video recorders DVD-RAM can be written to and read at the same time, allowing one program to be recorded and a different one, or an earlier part of the same one (time slip recording), to be viewed at the same time. DVD+RW recorders can achieve the same thing, and more recently some DVD-RW recorders achieve it as well (though only at the slower recording speeds).
* Usable with some high-end security digital video recorders, such as the Tecton Darlex, as a secure and long-lasting export medium.
* Holds more data when using Double Sided discs than dual-layer DVD+RW and DVD-RW - 9.4GB for DVD-RAM vs 8.5GB for DVD+RW DL and DVD-RW DL.
* Has write-protect tabs to prevent accidental deletion when used in a cartridge.

==Disadvantages==
* High-speed media unavailability: Only 3x and 5x discs were readily available, with 12x RAM2 discs being among the rarest of optical media and never sold outside Japan.
* Higher media cost.
* Less compatibility than DVD+RW and DVD-RW on many DVD devices and early DVD drives (example: ), despite DVD-RAM predates both formats (as noted above).
* If random writes are performed with a constant linear velocity (CLV), which may be the only available speed mode on specific drives and/or media, the speed of the rotary engine needs to be re-adjusted each time the pickup system jumps to another position on the disc, significantly impeding transfer speeds.

<text>A dunnart (from Noongar &quot;donat&quot;) is a narrow-footed marsupial the size of a European mouse, of the genus Sminthopsis. Dunnarts have a largely insectivorous diet.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus name &quot;Sminthopsis&quot; was published by Oldfield Thomas in 1887, the author noting that the name &quot;Podabrus&quot; that had previously been used to describe the species was preoccupied as a genus of beetles.
The type species is &quot;Phascogale crassicaudata&quot;, published by John Gould in 1844.

There are 19 species, all of them in Australia or New Guinea:

* Genus &quot;Sminthopsis&quot; 
** &quot;S. crassicaudata&quot; species-group
*** Fat-tailed dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis crassicaudata&quot;
** &quot;S. macroura&quot; species-group
*** Kakadu dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis bindi&quot;
*** Carpentarian dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis butleri&quot;
*** Julia Creek dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis douglasi&quot;
*** Stripe-faced dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis macroura&quot;
*** Red-cheeked dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis virginiae&quot;
** &quot;S. granulipes&quot; species-group
*** White-tailed dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis granulipes&quot;
** &quot;S. griseoventer&quot; species-group
*** Grey-bellied dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis griseoventer&quot;
** &quot;S. longicaudata&quot; species-group
*** Long-tailed dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis longicaudata&quot;
** &quot;S. murina&quot; species-group
*** Chestnut dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis archeri&quot;
*** Little long-tailed dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis dolichura&quot;
*** Sooty dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis fuliginosus&quot;
*** Gilbert&#x27;s dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis gilberti&quot;
*** White-footed dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis leucopus&quot;
*** Slender-tailed dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis murina&quot;
** &quot;S. psammophila&quot; species-group
*** Hairy-footed dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis hirtipes&quot;
*** Ooldea dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis ooldea&quot;
*** Sandhill dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis psammophila&quot;
*** Lesser hairy-footed dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis youngsoni&quot;

Additionally, two species are recognized by the American Society of Mammalogists:
* Froggatt&#x27;s dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis froggatti&quot;
* Stalker&#x27;s dunnart, &quot;Sminthopsis stalkeri&quot;

The American Society of Mammalogists also lists &quot;S. griseoventer&quot; as a synonym of &quot;S. fuliginosa&quot;, and moved &quot;S. longicaudata&quot; to the genus &quot;Antechinomys&quot;.

== Description ==
A male dunnart&#x27;s Y chromosome is the smallest known mammalian Y chromosome.

<text>The World Allround Speed Skating Championships are a series of speed skating events held annually to determine the best allround speed skater of the world. The event is held over two days, with all skaters entering the first three distances (500 m, 3000 m and 1500 m for women; 500 m, 5000 m and 1500 m for men) and the best eight skaters over these distances getting to ride the last event (5000 m for women; 10 000 m for men). The results of the races are converted to points, and the skater with lowest total score wins the championship.

The International Skating Union has organised the World Allround Championships for Men since 1893 (unofficial Championships were held in the years 1889–1892) and the World Allround Championships for Women since 1936 (unofficial Championships were held in the years 1933–1935). Since 1996 the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s World Allround Championships are held at the same time and venue. Since 2020, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s World Allround Championships are held every even year – at same time and venue as the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s World Sprint Championships.

*Kornél Pajor skated for Hungary until he defected in 1949. From then on, the ISU allowed him to participate as an independent skater representing the ISU, as he did winning the bronze medal in 1951.
*From 1889 to 1907 only gold medals were awarded: to win the gold medal, an athlete was required to win at least three of the distances. In seven competitions, no winner was declared due to this rule.
*Unofficial World Championships (not recognized by the ISU) included

<text>Koewacht is a village on the border between the Netherlands and Belgium.

The village consists of two parts; a Dutch and a (smaller) Belgian part.

== Overview ==
The Dutch part is located in Zeelandic Flanders, a part of the province of Zeeland and part of the municipality of Terneuzen. It was a separate municipality until 1970, when it was merged with Axel. In 2003, the Dutch part became part of the municipality of Terneuzen.

Koewacht is a border village. During the Dutch Revolt, it formed the border between the Dutch and Spanish held territories and over twenty forts were built in the area of which seven still have visible remains. Koewacht is a linear settlement on a ridge. In the 18th century, it became a centre for flax production. The church was built between 1713 and 1714, but became located in Belgium in 1839. During World War I, the border was sealed off and the Wire of Death, a lethal electric fence, ran through the village. Between 1921 and 1922, a church was built on the Dutch side.

The Belgian part lies in the province of East Flanders, in the municipalities of Moerbeke and Stekene.

<text>Standesamt Kolmar was a civil registration district (Standesamt) located in Kreis Kolmar, province of Posen of the German Empire (1871–1918) and administered the communities of:
Kol (S) = Kolmar (town); Kol (L) = Kolmar (rural area); Usc = Usch&lt;BR&gt;
Population data may be inaccurate (see German census of 1895).
The area around Kolmar was hilly and forested, sometimes called the &quot;Switzerland of Posen&quot;. Three lakes surround the town. The Standesamt region also included the area north of the hills, encompassing the Netze river farming communities. This area probably contains the greatest elevation difference of the entire province, from about 200 meters above sea level to about 40 meters.

The area was a major crossroads for both vehicle and rail. The railroad from Posen to Schneidemühl passed through Kolmer north/south and a line branched off to the east along the river bluff and then dipped south to Margonin, then back east to Gollantsh and points east. Major roads followed the same routes, except the east road continued along the bluff to Samotschin, and it had a western route, towards Czarnikau.

Like many other Posen communities, weaving was a major cottage industry until tariffs and industrialization made it unprofitable. A substantial ceramics (especially majolica) factory operated northwest of Kolmar for many years.

<text>Burton Latimer is a town in North Northamptonshire, England, approximately southeast of Kettering and 4.5 miles north of Wellingborough. At the 2021 census, its population was 10,444.

==History==
Burton (Latimer) appears in three entries in the Domesday Book of 1086.

Tenant-in-chief and Lord in 1086: Guy of Raimbeaucourt. 
Households: 21 villagers. 18 smallholders. 1 slave. 
Ploughland: 14 ploughlands (tre). 3 lord&#x27;s plough teams. 9 men&#x27;s plough teams.

Phillimore reference: 4,12

The second part of the town&#x27;s name is derived from the le Latimer family who lived there in the 13th century. The first part of the name usually means fortified farmstead or farmstead near a fortification. Before the arrival of the Latimers, it was known as &#x27;Burtone&#x27;.

=== Industrial history ===
Burton Latimer grew in the 19th century around the ironstone quarrying, clothing and footwear industries. A watermill used for grinding corn was converted and used at various times in the 19th century for the manufacture of silk and worsted and for carpet-weaving, followed by its conversion to a steam mill to make chicory, mustard, animal foodstuffs and flour. The mill was acquired in the 1930s and became the home of Weetabix, which is also produced in Corby.

Ironstone quarrying began in about 1872 to the north of the town, to the south of the Kettering, Thrapston and Huntingdon Railway. More quarries were started in the west in the vicinity of Polwell Lane and more extensively on the east side of the town. The last pits ceased production of iron ore in 1921. The ore was taken by gauge tramways to the mainline railways. At first the tramways were worked by horses but steam locomotives were introduced in 1891. The quarry near Polwell Lane was re-opened in 1925 for the extraction of ganister. The tramway to the main railway from this quarry was operated by small diesel locomotives. The quarry ceased production in 1983.

By 1885, the first four clothing factories had opened, followed in 1898 by the first shoe factory, and Burton grew rapidly to become a small, thriving light-industrial town.

By 2000 the town&#x27;s new bypass and the building of the A14 made the town attractive again as a manufacturing and distribution centre. High-profile national firms like Versalift, Alpro Soya and Abbeyboard have based themselves on the north side of town.

In the 2020s, more manufacturing and distribution centres have been erected on the north side of Burton Latimer, such as the recently completed establishment of &#x27;Symmetry Park&#x27; and the other warehouses built at the Kettering Gateway.

==Landmarks==

A notable building in the town is the parish church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, which was consecrated in 1147. The Norman church was remodelled and added to at various times up to about 1310. It was restored and the tower rebuilt in 1866. It contains a number of medieval wall paintings, a 15th-century chancel screen and some monumental brasses. The oldest of the latter is located between the south arcade and chancel screen and features the coat of arms of the Boyville family; it was almost certainly placed there in the early 16th century to commemorate Richard Boyville, his wife Gresyll and their children.

The war memorial, currently located at the corner of Church Street and High Street was erected in 1922. It has moved locations a couple times but now remains where it was first erected.

The town is home to the land-owning Harpur family, who have owned the Grade I listed Burton Latimer Hall since 1760, together with other land around the town. Burton Latimer Hall was built using the same light-toned stone as used in buildings in the north-east part of the town. It is rumoured that a secret tunnel connects Burton Latimer Hall and the nearby St Mary’s Church, but it has never been found.

There is a Jacobean House, built in 1622, which was formerly a school. On the front of this house, a stone tablet states: &quot;This house was built 1622 the freschoole was founded by thomas burbanke and margaret his wife 1587 memoria. ivsti. benedicta. pro&quot;.

Burton Latimer Pocket Park was established on the riverbank in 1995. The 11-acre plot of land houses many different species of animals and is a popular place for recreational fishing. A duck race and fête is held at the park each June.

==Modern day==
Burton Latimer is the location of the first wind farm in Northamptonshire. Burton Wold Wind Farm, operated by Your Energy, has 10 turbines, producing enough electricity to power around 8,500 homes annually (around a quarter of Kettering Borough&#x27;s households). The wind farm is the largest inland wind farm. Burton Latimer is home to the Weetabix food company, Shield aluminium, and several group undertakings and a Wm Morrisons supermarket distribution centre, which are major local employers.

In addition to the ancient St. Mary&#x27;s Church (built in 1187), there are four churches in the town. The other three are: Burton Latimer Methodist Church, Burton Latimer Baptist Church, and St. Nicholas Owen RC Church.

There is the Britannia Working Men&#x27;s Club, the Olde Victoria and a band club. There is a Conservative club, and a civic centre, as well as a community centre.

<doc id="454577" wikidata="Q665715" url="?curid=454577" title="The Swiss Family Robinson">
<text>The Swiss Family Robinson (German: &quot;Der Schweizerische Robinson&quot;, &quot;The Swiss Robinson&quot;) is a novel by the Swiss author Johann David Wyss, first published in 1812, about a Swiss family of immigrants whose ship en route to Port Jackson, Australia goes off course and is shipwrecked in the East Indies. The ship&#x27;s crew is lost, but the family and several domestic animals survive. They make their way to shore, where they build a settlement, undergoing several adventures before being rescued; some refuse rescue and remain on the island.

The book is the most successful of a large number of &quot;Robinsonade&quot; novels that were written in response to the success of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719). It has gone through a large number of versions and adaptations.

==History==
Written by Swiss writer Johann David Wyss, edited by his son Johann Rudolf Wyss, and illustrated by another son, Johann Emmanuel Wyss, the novel was intended to teach his four sons about family values, good farming, the uses of the natural world, and self-reliance. Wyss&#x27;s attitude toward its education is in line with the teachings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and many chapters involve Christian-oriented moral lessons such as frugality, husbandry, acceptance, and cooperation.

Wyss presents adventures as lessons in natural history and physical science. This resembles other educational books for young ones published about the same time. These include Charlotte Turner Smith&#x27;s &quot;Rural Walks: in Dialogues intended for the use of Young Persons&quot; (1795), &quot;Rambles Farther: A continuation of Rural Walks&quot; (1796), and &quot;A Natural History of Birds, intended chiefly for young persons&quot; (1807). But Wyss&#x27;s novel is also modeled after Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, an adventure story about a shipwrecked sailor first published in 1719.

The book presents a geographically impossible array of large mammals and plants that probably could never have existed together on a single island, for the children&#x27;s education, nourishment, clothing, and convenience.

An 1814 French adaptation by Isabelle de Montolieu and 1824 continuation (from chapter 37), &quot;Le Robinson suisse, ou, Journal d&#x27;un père de famille, naufragé avec ses enfants,&quot; added further adventures of Fritz, Ernest, Jack, and Franz.

The closest English translation to the original is that of the Juvenile Library in 1816, published as &quot;The Family Robinson Crusoe, or, Journal of a Father Shipwrecked, with his Wife and Children, on an Uninhabited Island&quot;, in two volumes, by the husband-and-wife team William Godwin and Mary Jane Clairmont, reprinted by Penguin Classics.

Since then, there have been many versions of the story with episodes added, changed, or deleted. Perhaps the best-known English version is by William H. G. Kingston, first published in 1879. It is translated from the German &quot;with the omission of the long sententious lectures found in the original.&quot; Around the same year, an abridged version of 112 pages by &quot;I. F. M.&quot; was published, which told the story entirely in words of only one syllable (excepting some proper nouns, &quot;i.e&quot;. Robinson).

Other English editions that claim to include the whole of the Wyss-Montolieu narrative are by W. H. Davenport Adams (1869–1910) and Mrs. H. B. Paull (1879). As Carpenter and Prichard write in &quot;The Oxford Companion to Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; (Oxford, 1995), &quot;with all the expansions and contractions over the past two centuries (this includes a long history of abridgments, condensations, Christianizing, and Disney products), Wyss&#x27;s original narrative has long since been obscured.&quot; 

Although movie and television adaptations typically name the family &quot;Robinson&quot;, it is not a Swiss name. The German title translates as &quot;The Swiss Robinson&quot; which identifies the novel as part of the Robinsonade genre, rather than a story about a family named Robinson.

==Plot==

The novel opens with a Swiss family in the hold of a sailing ship, weathering a great storm. The ship&#x27;s crew evacuates without them, so William, Elizabeth, and their four sons (Fritz, Ernest, Jack, and Francis) are left to survive alone. As the ship tosses about, William prays that God will spare them.

The ship survives the night, and the family finds themselves within sight of a tropical desert island. The following day, they decide to get to the island they can see beyond the reef. With much effort, they construct a vessel out of tubs. After they fill the tubs with food, ammunition, and other items of value they can safely carry, they row toward the island. Two dogs from the ship, Turk and Juno, swim beside them. The ship&#x27;s cargo of livestock (including a cow, a donkey, two goats, six sheep, a ram, a pig, chickens, ducks, geese, and pigeons), guns and powder, carpentry tools, books, a disassembled pinnace and provisions have survived.

Upon reaching the island, the family set up a makeshift camp. William knows that they must prepare for a long time on the island and his thoughts are as much on provisions for the future as on their immediate wants. William and his oldest son Fritz spend the next day exploring the island.

The family spends the next few days securing themselves against hunger. William and Fritz make several trips to the ship to bring everything useful from the vessel ashore. The domesticated animals on the ship are towed back to the island. There is also a great store of firearms and ammunition, hammocks for sleeping, carpenter&#x27;s tools, lumber, cooking utensils, silverware, and dishes. Initially, they construct a treehouse, but as time passes (and after Elizabeth is injured climbing the stairs down from it), they settle in a more permanent dwelling in part of a cave. Fritz rescues a young Englishwoman named Jenny Montrose, who was shipwrecked elsewhere on their island.

The book covers more than ten years. William and the older boys explore various environments and develop homes and gardens at various sites about the island. Ultimately, the father wonders if they will ever see the rest of humanity again. Eventually, a British ship that is in search of Jenny Montrose anchors near the island and is discovered by the family. The captain is given the journal containing the story of their life on the island, which is eventually published. Several family members continue to live tranquilly on their island, while several return to Europe with the British.

==Characters==

The principal characters of the book (including Isabelle de Montolieu&#x27;s adaptations and continuation) are:
* William (unnamed in the original) – The patriarch of the family. He is the narrator of the story and leads the family. He knows an enormous amount of information on almost everything the family comes across, demonstrating bravery and self-reliance. The German text calls him a &quot;Schweizer-Prediger&quot; (Swiss preacher), but this detail is absent from English and French translations.
* Elizabeth (unnamed in the original) – The loving mother of the family. She is intelligent and resourceful, arming herself even before leaving the ship with a &quot;magic bag&quot; filled with supplies, including sewing materials and seeds for food crops. She is also a remarkably versatile cook, taking on anything from porcupine soup to roast penguins.
* Fritz – The oldest of the four boys, he is 15. Fritz is intelligent but impetuous. He is the strongest and accompanies his father on many quests.
* Ernest () – The second oldest of the boys is 13. Ernest is the most intelligent, but a less physically active boy, often described by his father as &quot;indolent&quot;. Like Fritz, however, he comes to be an excellent shot.
* Jack () – The third oldest of the boys, 11 years old. He is thoughtless, bold, energetic, and the quickest in the group.
* Francis - The youngest of the boys, he is eight years old when the story opens. He usually stays home with his mother.
* Jenny Montrose - A young English girl who is shipwrecked on the island and comes to live with the family.
* Turk () – The family&#x27;s English dog.
* Juno () – The family&#x27;s Danish dog.
* Nip (also called Knips or Nips in some editions; called &quot;Knips&quot; in the German) – An orphan monkey adopted by the family after their dogs Turk and Juno have killed his mother. The family uses him to test for poisonous fruits.
* Fangs () – A jackal that is tamed by the family.

In the novel, the family is not called &quot;Robinson&quot; as their surname is not mentioned; the intention of the title is to compare them to Robinson Crusoe. However, in 1900, Jules Verne published &quot;The Castaways of the Flag&quot; (alternatively known as &quot;Second Fatherland&quot;), where he revisits the original shipwreck. In this sequel, of the family&#x27;s final years on the original island, the family is called Zermatt (which is, as &quot;Robinson&quot;, not a swiss name – however, &quot;Zermatten&quot; is).

==Other adaptations==
The novels, in one form or another, have also been adapted numerous times, sometimes changing location and time period:

=== Book sequels ===
* &quot;Le Robinson suisse, ou, Journal d&#x27;un père de famille, naufragé avec ses enfants&quot; (1824) by Isabelle de Montolieu, new edition of the novel with further adventures.
* &quot;Willis the Pilot: a sequel to The Swiss family Robinson; or, Adventures of an emigrant family wrecked on an unknown coast of the Pacific Ocean&quot; (1858) has been attributed to Johann Wyss or to Johanna Spyri, author of &quot;Heidi&quot;.

<doc id="454578" wikidata="Q219987" url="?curid=454578" title="Puck County">
<text>Puck County (, ) is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Pomeranian Voivodeship, northern Poland, on the Baltic coast. The &quot;powiat&quot; of this name existed in the history of Poland, since the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth up to 1795, and then reintroduced in 1999.

==Modern Puck County==
The modern Puck County came into being on January 1, 1999, as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998. Its administrative seat is the town of Puck, which lies north of the regional capital Gdańsk. The county contains three other towns: Władysławowo, north of Puck, Jastarnia, east of Puck, and Hel, east of Puck, at the tip of the Hel Peninsula.

The county covers an area of . As of 2019 its total population is 85,211, out of which the population of Puck is 11,213, that of Władysławowo is 9,930, that of Hel is 3,267, that of Jastarnia is 2,704, and the rural population is 58,097.
&lt;br&gt;

&quot;Puck County on a map of the counties of Pomeranian Voivodeship&quot;

Puck County is bordered by the city of Gdynia to the south and Wejherowo County to the south-west. It also borders the Bay of Puck to the east and the Baltic Sea to the north.

===Administrative division===
The county is subdivided into seven gminas (three urban, one urban-rural and three rural). These are listed in the following table, in descending order of population.

==Transport==

=== Railway transport ===
The railway network in the area of this county consists of two active railway lines, 213 and dismantled 263. The lines intersected in Swarzewo.

The station in Puck was located closest to the sea on the Polish railway network, which is why a temporary harbor with a railway siding was built in Puck. The development of railways in the county in the 1920s caused the development of tourism on Hel Spit. Because of the largely tourist traffic on Hel Spit, line 213 shows high seasonal variability of transports. Freight traffic, due to the lack of industry, is marginal.

<doc id="454579" wikidata="Q890216" url="?curid=454579" title="Boeing Sonic Cruiser">
<text>The Boeing Sonic Cruiser was a concept jet airliner with a delta wing–canard configuration. It was distinguished from conventional airliners by its delta wing and high-subsonic/transonic cruising speed of up to Mach 0.98. Boeing first proposed it in 2001, but airlines generally preferred lower operating costs over higher speed. Boeing ended the Sonic Cruiser project in December 2002 and shifted to the slower (Mach 0.85) but more fuel-efficient 7E7 (later named 787 Dreamliner) airliner.

==Design and development==

The Sonic Cruiser was born from one of numerous outline research and development projects that began in the 1990s at Boeing with the goal to look at potential designs for a possible new near-sonic or supersonic airliner. The Sonic Cruiser was publicly unveiled on March 29, 2001, shortly after the launch of the A380 by rival Airbus. Boeing had recently withdrawn its proposed 747X derivative from competition with the A380 when not enough airline interest was forthcoming, and instead proposed the Sonic Cruiser as a completely different approach. Instead of the A380&#x27;s massive capacity, requiring a hub and spoke model of operation, the Sonic Cruiser was designed for rapid point-to-point connections for 200 to 250 passengers. Critics stated that Boeing had timed its announcement in an attempt to distract from the launch of the A380.

Boeing&#x27;s 2001 patent detailed the breadth of delta wing-canard concepts studied, which included a supersonic variant with four engines capable of cruising at Mach 1.5 to 3.0, various tail, engine location, and inlet and outlet configurations, smaller supersonic and subsonic business jets, and what Boeing called a &quot;modular&quot; system, where the cruise speed could be changed from supersonic to near-sonic by an interchangeable nose; the &quot;Sonic Cruiser&quot; was a near-sonic variant. The origin has been traced back to 1995, with the formation of an internal Airplane Creation Process Strategy team, which had designed a plane code-named Project Glacier that strongly resembled the initial Sonic Cruiser drawings by fall 2000. In early 2001, Boeing CEO Alan Mulally began privately publicizing the concept to potential customers, touting its improved speed at an efficiency similar to existing designs.

Don Carty (American Airlines) and Sir Richard Branson (Virgin Atlantic) were openly enthusiastic for the Sonic Cruiser, and Branson expected to make a tentative order of three to six aircraft in May 2001. The March 29, 2001 announcement was followed by a larger media event at the Paris Air Show on June 19, where futurist John Naisbitt and Mulally praised the concept, unveiled as a -scale model. &quot;Popular Science&quot; named the Sonic Cruiser to its list of the Best of What&#x27;s New in 2001.

===Configurations===

Boeing continued to tweak the design through the summer of 2001. Initial sketches released to the public were highly conjectural. A patent drawing filed by Boeing in early 2001 put the baseline aircraft&#x27;s dimensions at approximately in length, with a wingspan of . With a delta wing and canards arrangement, and flying just short of the speed of sound at Mach 0.95–0.98 (about at altitude), the Sonic Cruiser promised 15–20% faster speed than conventional airliners without the noise pollution caused by the sonic boom from supersonic travel. As an example, a flight using the Sonic Cruiser from London to Singapore was expected to be two hours shorter than one using a conventional airliner. In addition, the landing and takeoff noise was expected to meet Stage 4 requirements. The aircraft was designed to fly at altitudes in excess of to avoid existing air traffic, with a range between . Boeing estimated the Sonic Cruiser&#x27;s fuel efficiency would be comparable to best performing twin-engine wide body airliners in 2002 on a per-passenger basis.

Boeing intended to use advanced composite and titanium materials to reduce weight and further improve fuel efficiency. In order to successfully build a commercial airplane with such a high advanced materials content (projected to be 60–70% of the airframe by weight), Boeing lined up a consortium of international partners with experience in aerostructures. By the end of 2001, those materials were being applied to an aircraft in Project Yellowstone, a competing project using more conventional airplane designs. That aircraft, being designed under Yellowstone as the replacement for the 757/767, was later announced as the 7E7, with &quot;E&quot; standing for &quot;Efficient&quot;. As a baseline reference model using advanced materials, the proposed 7E7 would consume 10% less fuel than the Sonic Cruiser, and 17–20% less than the 767-300.

The design team at Boeing was finalizing the Sonic Cruiser configuration throughout 2002. Wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics analysis were used to refine the Sonic Cruiser concept. Based on artwork released by Boeing in July 2002, the Sonic Cruiser now sported two taller vertical tails with no inward cant, and the forward canard was set at zero degrees dihedral. By that time, three different designs had been advanced: one was the original canard-delta wing design, and two were more conventional mid-fuselage wing designs in the interest of better compatibility with existing airport jetway equipment, although those two designs were unable to offer the same performance as the original configuration.

===Cancellation and subsequent research===
In the end, most airlines favored lower operating costs over a marginal increase in speed, and the project did not attract the interest for which Boeing had been hoping. In some cases, the increased speed would lead to operational complications; aircraft could arrive at airports prior to the end of the morning curfew. Demand for air travel fell dramatically after the September 11 attacks, and Boeing began publicizing Project Yellowstone to potential customers for the first time in February and March 2002. Branson, an early supporter of the Sonic Cruiser, was openly skeptical of the aircraft&#x27;s prospects by July 2002: &quot;Unless more runways are built the Sonic Cruiser is going to struggle because airlines will not have the slots to use the aircraft.&quot; None of the prospective operators prioritized improved aircraft speed in a meeting with Boeing held in October 2002.

The Sonic Cruiser project was finally abandoned by December 2002 in favor of the slower but more fuel-efficient Project Yellowstone/7E7 (later renamed Boeing 787 Dreamliner). Much of the research from the Sonic Cruiser was applied to the 787, including carbon fiber reinforced plastic for the fuselage and wings, bleedless engines, cockpit and avionics design.

In 2010, Boeing published a paper detailing several concepts for a supersonic airliner with reduced passenger count, derived from its work with the Sonic Cruiser and earlier NASA work on a High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) concept. The concepts, developed under a NASA grant, included the 765-072B (approximately 100 passengers with a cruise at Mach 1.6–1.8), a smaller 765-076E business jet (30 passengers, Mach 1.6), and a larger 765-107B, nicknamed &#x27;Icon-II&#x27; (120 passengers, Mach 1.8). All of the concepts had a range less than .

On April 16, 2012, Boeing published an application for a patent for an aircraft configuration similar to that of the Sonic Cruiser; the patent was granted in 2014.

<text>Raymond &quot;Ossie&quot; Clark (9 June 1942 – 6 August 1996) was a British fashion designer who was a major figure in the Swinging Sixties scene in London and the fashion industry in that era. Clark is now renowned for his vintage designs by present-day designers.

Clark is compared to the 1960s fashion great Biba and influenced many other designers, including Yves Saint Laurent, Anna Sui and Tom Ford. Manolo Blahnik has said of Ossie Clark&#x27;s work: &quot;He created an incredible magic with the body and achieved what fashion should do—produce desire.&quot; Ossie Clark and Ossie Clark for Radley clothes are highly sought after, and are worn by well known models such as Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell.

==Childhood and education==
Ossie Clark was born on 9 June 1942 to Ann and Samuel Clark in Warrington, Lancashire, England. During the war, the Clark family moved to Oswaldtwistle, where he was given his nickname, &quot;Ossie&quot; when they later moved to Warrington in 1950. Ossie&#x27;s mother, Ann Grace Clark, was in labour with Ossie for seven days &amp; gave birth during an air raid in the Second World War. Ann had been expecting a girl and had no name picked out for her new baby boy. She let the midwife name him Raymond. Ossie was the youngest of six children (Gladys, Marjorie (later known as Kay) Beryl, Sammy and John). Ossie and his brother John &amp; Kay&#x27;s son James sang in the church choir at St Oswald&#x27;s Church in Winwick, where Ossie won awards for his vocal talents.

Family and friends noted that from a very early age he was &quot;brilliant at doing anything&quot;. Young Ossie would make clothes for his nieces and nephews. He practised tailoring clothing on his dolls and designed swimsuits for the neighbourhood girls when not yet 10 years old. Roy Thomas, the art teacher at Ossie&#x27;s secondary school – himself heavily involved in fabric art – recognised Ossie&#x27;s creative flair and gave him a large collection of &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazines. Clark pored over these magazines and absorbed the glamour and cutting edge fashion.

At the age of 13 Ossie studied architecture in school. He later said that the experience was &quot;invaluable&quot;. The class taught him the fundamentals of proportion, height and volume. He would later go on to use all of these to great effect in his fashion designs.

Soon after leaving Beamont Secondary Technical School, Clark attended the Regional College of Art in Manchester at the age of 16. Ossie had to get up very early in the morning to make the long trip from home to college each day. Anne Clark would give Ossie prescribed pills to keep him awake and alert. This would be the start of a lifelong addiction to both prescribed and illegal drugs.

While attending college in Manchester, Clark was introduced to Celia Birtwell by a close friend and classmate named Mo McDermott. The pair started out as just good friends but that friendship soon developed into a love affair. Ossie also became good friends with artist David Hockney during this period. Clark and Hockney took an inspirational trip to New York City together while still at college where they made many valuable connections in the fashion, art and entertainment communities. The friends are widely rumoured to have been lovers with a volatile relationship. Clark graduated from the Regional College of Art in 1962...

Clark then attended the Royal College of Art in London and achieved a first-class degree in 1965. While attending college in London, Celia Birtwell came to live with Ossie in his small Notting Hill flat. Ossie&#x27;s degree fashion show at the RCA was a huge success. At this time his design style was heavily influenced by pop art and Hollywood glamour. The final line-up featured a dress with flashing lightbulbs down the front which was shown in every major newspaper and fashion publication the following day. The fashion press swamped Ossie with requests for photo-shoots and special order garments. In August that year he had his first feature in British &quot;Vogue&quot;. A popular shop named &#x27;Woollands 21&#x27; in London&#x27;s Sloane Street was the first to begin selling Ossie Clark&#x27;s clothing line.

==Early career==
Clark quickly began to make his mark in the fashion industry, with Alice Pollock&#x27;s exclusive boutique Quorum featuring his designs in 1966. Clark had been introduced to Pollock at his RCA show by Quorum&#x27;s backer at the behest of Hockney and so taken with the young designer was she that she immediately decided to bring him in as co designer for Quorum. Ossie presented a collection of white and cream chiffon garments that sold fast. Pollock wanted Clark&#x27;s clothes to have a more organic feel, and so commissioned Celia Birtwell to produce special textiles for the next collection. In this way one of fashion&#x27;s most famous collaborations was born, with Clark designing clothes and Birtwell designing prints.

This partnership would last for almost all of Clark&#x27;s career in fashion. Author Judith Watt comments: &quot;Celia collaborated with Ossie. This was a joint effort. People say that she was his muse, which indeed she was, but their work absolutely went hand in hand. It was her designs that he used to create his. I think it&#x27;s unfair that she not be given that voice&quot;.

Ossie was noted, from this period on, for buying six new record albums a week, all from the newest and most popular recording artists. His love of music and art were legendary amongst Ossie&#x27;s friends. Also at this time Ossie began to take hard drugs more recreationally with friend and business partner Alice Pollock. &quot;This is when his character began to change&quot; says longtime friend Lady Henrietta Rous.

The first full Ossie Clark collection was bought by the Henri Bendel department store in New York. His simple, elegant dresses were widely copied by the designers on Seventh Avenue.

==Peak: 1965–1974==
The period from 1965 to 1974 is regarded as Clark&#x27;s zenith, during which time he had many famous clients.

In the late 1960s, Clark hit a rich vein for his flamboyant clothing range. The fashion press dubbed Ossie the &quot;King of King&#x27;s Road&quot;. Clark pronounced himself a &quot;master cutter. It&#x27;s all in my brain and fingers and there&#x27;s no-one in the world to touch me. I can do everything myself.&quot; Clark&#x27;s great idol was the famous dancer Nijinsky and his love of dance inspired his clothes to be free moving and not to restrict the female form. This style of dressing became quite popular in the 1970s thanks in large part to the popularity of Clark&#x27;s clothing. Ossie Clark is well known for his use of muted colours and moss crepe fabric. He also designed shoes, paper dresses, and snakeskin jackets.

While Ossie and Alice were great at creating an image and drawing in the rich and famous, they were less successful at managing a business. Many garments were given away to celebrities or just disappeared from the shop. By 1967, Quorum, the partnership between Alice Pollock and Ossie, was deeply in debt and Alice&#x27;s financial backer, Mike Armitage, a stockbroker, decided there was little possibility of Quorum ever making a profit and he and Alice agreed to sell Quorum to a large UK fashion house, Radley (run by Alfred Radley). Radley took over Quorum&#x27;s debts and put the management onto a sound basis. Alfred Radley was keen to maintain what made Ossie special and so he continued to support Ossie&#x27;s aspirations by developing the Ossie Clark brand and funding large annual fashion shows, expanding Quorum&#x27;s retail business and distributing Ossie&#x27;s dresses to leading retailers around the world through the introduction of the &quot;Ossie Clark for Radley&quot; collections.

In 1967 Clark presented his first fashion show under the patronage of Radley at Chelsea Town Hall for Pathé News. It was a seminal turning point in the history of fashion shows which were never to be the same again. He also showed his first full collection in London&#x27;s Berkeley Square. It was also the first British fashion show to feature black models. In 1968 Clark designed his first of many diffusion lines for Radley, &quot;Ossie Clark for Radley&quot; that made his clothes available to a high street clientele. 
Clark was not just popular in London, but also in New York and Paris. He dressed the rich and famous who inhabited fashionable British society of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Clark got in on the ground floor of many of the popular performers and actors of the time period and was accepted in their circles when many other designers were not. This gave him many advantages to dress the rich and famous. Clark made many stage costumes for Mick Jagger, the Beatles, Marianne Faithfull and Liza Minnelli, among others. Peter Gabriel borrowed a red Clark dress from his wife Jill to wear with a fox&#x27;s head, as depicted on the cover of the Genesis album &quot;Foxtrot&quot;.

He married Celia Birtwell in 1969, and together they had two sons, Albert and George. Clark had long hoped for a large family of his own, and his children were a great joy in his life.

Clark freely adopted the hedonistic lifestyle of the 1960s and 1970s: his drug use greatly impacted on his emotional state and finances. Clark and Birtwell divorced in 1974. This started a slow downward spiral for Ossie, who never recovered emotionally from the separation from Birtwell and his two children. With his family structure and work stability now gone, his creative output became strained.

However, in 1977 Ossie went into business with Tony Calder and Peter Lee, and for two years enjoyed a revival with hugely successful fashion shows, rave reviews and commercial stability. Fashion writer Ann Chubb wrote &quot;It is great to see him right back on form again after a few years in the doldrums&quot;.

==1980s and later==
Going into the 1980s, fashion—British fashion in particular—turned towards the new punk rock craze. Clothing from Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s shop on the King&#x27;s Road became the most popular look and one of Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Scum&quot; T-shirt text went so far as to include Ossie Clark under the heading &quot;Hates&quot;. Clark&#x27;s romantic flowing gowns were no longer in fashion. His fortunes declined to bankruptcy and he largely stopped working commercially. Famously devoid of business acumen, he blamed his downfall on banks and the taxman&#x27;s ruthless insistence on cashing in all his assets. His bitterness at this and a short-sighted determination to sit out the bankruptcy term, along with deep depression, meant he worked only on private commissions that were paid for by barter. A loyal band of famous clients and friends would order a dress and pay for it by loaning a holiday house in the Caribbean or paying for his sewing machine to be repaired.

In 1984 he was persuaded by a friend to go back to work with Radley. Clark produced garments with shoulder details based on sea shells but according to his diaries was then sacked by Radley that same year. A note written by Clark to the DHSS (p. 147) says: &quot;I did not leave my position as a dress designer with Firwool of my own accord, as stated overleaf. It was put to me that as my designs weren&#x27;t selling, they couldn&#x27;t continue to invest in me and I was given two weeks notice on the 19th of October 1984. I wasn&#x27;t offered a choice of continuing to work or not—I was fired.&quot; This version of events is backed up by a friend, the artist Guy Burch, who recalls that Clark told him Radley had found the complicated shell patterns impossible to make commercially.

Although the 1980s were chaotic and nomadic there were brighter sides to his life charted in his published diaries. In January 1978 he had met his second long-term partner Nicholas Balaban, who was working as a barman at the Sombrero Club in Kensington. With Clark&#x27;s encouragement Balaban applied to the Byam Shaw School of Art and went on to start his own highly successful fashion business producing printed T-shirts for high-street boutiques and multiples. Although most published accounts choose not to pay much attention to Clark&#x27;s gay relationships, his sexuality was predominantly homosexual. Clark&#x27;s continued erratic behaviour eventually led to the relationship&#x27;s collapse in 1983/84. His depression deepened even more as he obsessed over Balaban, trying unsuccessfully to rekindle the relationship. Only with Balaban&#x27;s death from AIDS in 1994 and a conversion to Buddhism did Clark finally begin to rebuild a career and shake off the past. In the early 1990s he trained the designer Bella Freud to pattern-cut and an extremely promising new beginning was the use of Clark&#x27;s mastery of pattern-cutting chiffon and delicate fabrics by the Ghost label. Clark found their computerised pattern cutter a revelation, able to turn initial ideas into formers almost instantaneously.

==Death==
On 6 August 1996, Ossie Clark was stabbed to death in his council flat, in Kensington and Chelsea, London, by his former lover, 28-year-old Italian, Diego Cogolato. In March 1997, Cogolato was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and was subsequently jailed for six years.

==Legacy==

Ossie Clark is featured in David Hockney&#x27;s 1970 painting &quot;Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy&quot;. It now hangs in the Tate Britain gallery on Millbank and is one of the most visited paintings in Britain. He also appears prominently in the 1974 Hockney biopic, &quot;A Bigger Splash&quot;. His diaries, which he began in 1971, were published posthumously by his close friend Lady Henrietta Rous in 1998 as &quot;The Ossie Clark Diaries&quot;. In 1999–2000, Warrington Museum &amp; Art Gallery held the first retrospective of his work. Another retrospective was held at London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum in 2003. A book from this show, &quot;Ossie Clark: 1965–74&quot;, is published by Adrams Books and the V&amp;A Museum.

In November 2007, Marc Worth, the founder of WGSN purchased the name Quorum and announced the re-launch of &quot;Ossie Clark&quot;. The re-launched label&#x27;s first collection, Autumn/Winter 2008/09 collection was shown at the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington, during London Fashion Week in February 2008. Avsh Alom Gur, a graduate of the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, was appointed as the Head of Design. In July 2009, it was announced that &quot;due to market conditions&quot; the label was to cease operations yet again.

Fashion designers influenced by Ossie Clark include Anna Sui, John Galliano, Christian Lacroix, Dries Van Noten, Malcolm Hall, Clements Ribeiro, Marc Jacobs, Gucci and Prada. The label Ghost, known for its diaphanous gowns, has also been influenced by Ossie Clark.

Original Ossie Clark pieces have been considered collector&#x27;s items since the start of the 1990s, especially those designed by Clark/Birtwell.

<text>Saint Joseph&#x27;s University (SJU or St. Joe&#x27;s) is a private Jesuit university in Philadelphia, Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The university was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1851 as Saint Joseph&#x27;s College. Saint Joseph&#x27;s is the seventh oldest Jesuit university in the United States and the sixth largest university in Philadelphia. It is named after Saint Joseph. It merged in 2022 with the University of the Sciences (formerly known as Philadelphia College of Pharmacy). In 2023, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University announced it would acquire Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences. This will expand Saint Joseph&#x27;s University by adding a campus in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and expanding the size of the student body especially with students studying nursing and health.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s University has nearly 9,000 undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students in over 134 undergraduate programs, 77 graduate programs, and 9 adult learner programs. It has 14 centers and institutes, including the Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support and the Pedro Arrupe, S.J., Center for Business Ethics.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s athletics teams, the Hawks, are an NCAA Division I program that competes in the Atlantic 10 Conference and the Philadelphia Big 5. The official colors of the university are crimson and gray. The school mascot is The Hawk, which never stops flapping its wings while in costume.

==Jesuit and Catholic identity==
The university&#x27;s Jesuit community live in one of two locations on the Hawk Hill campus. The Loyola Center, located on City Line Avenue, is connected to Manresa Hall, the infirmary for Jesuits. The Loyola Center exclusively houses retired members of the Jesuit Community. The second location, Arrupe Hall, serves as housing for active Jesuits at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, and features a large dining hall and chapel.

The university extensively uses its Jesuit identity in its branding. It began the Magis (&quot;greater&quot;) campaign in 2013 to highlight commitment to living &quot;For the greater glory of God&quot; (&quot;Ad maiorem Dei gloriam&quot;), the motto of the Society of Jesus.

SJU also promotes the Jesuit principle of &quot;cura personalis&quot; or &quot;care for the whole person.&quot; Undergraduates must complete a general education program that focuses heavily on traditional liberal arts disciplines.

On September 27, 2015, Pope Francis, a Jesuit, made a stop at the university during his two-day visit to Philadelphia.

==History==
===Beginning of Collegiate Jesuit Education in Philadelphia===
St. Joe&#x27;s, founded by the Jesuits in 1851 as Saint Joseph&#x27;s College, is the seventh oldest Jesuit university in the United States and is named after the legal father of Jesus, Saint Joseph.
===Origin of North America&#x27;s First College of Pharmacy===
On June 1, 2022, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University acquired University of the Sciences (aka USciences and fka Philadelphia College of Pharmacy), adding professional programs in health and science, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, pharmacy and physician assistant (as USciences had offered more than 30 degree and certification programs across a wide range of pharmaceutical and healthcare-related disciplines.). Hence, St. Joe&#x27;s can now trace its history to February 1821, when 68 apothecaries aka pharmacists met in Philadelphia&#x27;s Carpenters&#x27; Hall to establish improved scientific standards and to develop programs to train more competent apprentices and students. Classes began nearly immediately, making it the first institution of higher learning in the United States dedicated to the field of pharmacy.

In 1825, the college began publishing the first academic journal in the United States dedicated to pharmacy. The apothecaries formalized their new association through a constitution, which declared their intent to establish a school of pharmacy to enhance their vocation and to &quot;guard the drug market from the introduction of spurious, adulterated, deteriorated or otherwise mischievous articles, which are too frequently forced into it&quot;.

===Campus locations of Philadelphia&#x27;s first Jesuit college===
St. Joe&#x27;s college started on September 15, 1851, when 36 students began classes in a building adjacent to Old St. Joseph&#x27;s Church Roman Catholic church on Willings Alley, between South 3rd and South 4th Streets and Walnut and Spruce Streets in Philadelphia.

St. Joe&#x27;s moved in 1866 from Willings Alley to a full block on Girard Avenue between 17th and 18th Streets in Philadelphia (now the location of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Preparatory School).

St. Joe&#x27;s moved to its present City Avenue Hawk Hill campus in November 1927 after St. Joe&#x27;s raised over million dollars enabling the (i) purchase of twenty-three acres and (ii) construction of its modern collegiate Gothic architectural main academic building.

===Seal===

The Seal of Saint Joseph&#x27;s University signifies its history and values. Other Jesuit educational institutions share three of these symbols. The wolves over a kettle pot show the generosity of the Loyola family towards the poor. Tradition claims that the Loyolas provided so much food for their soldiers that even the wolves had enough to eat. IHS are the first three letters of the name of Jesus in Greek, and the historic monogram of the Society of Jesus. The stripes signify the 7 sons of the House of Loyola, who died defending their home. The lily is the distinguishing symbol of the university, honoring Saint Joseph, the school&#x27;s patron saint. The seal is the graphical representation of Saint Joseph&#x27;s and its Jesuit identity.

===Presidents===
On March 10, 2023, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University&#x27;s board of trustees elected Cheryl A. McConnell its 29th – and first female – president in the university&#x27;s 172-year history, effective immediately. McConnell is a 35-year veteran of Jesuit higher education, having most recently served as Saint Joseph&#x27;s interim president since last June, and as provost and chief academic officer for three years prior.

==Academics==
The university has four schools and colleges that offer 211 academic programs and 9 degree-completion and post-baccalaureate certificate programs.

Of tenure-track faculty, 100% hold the highest possible degrees in their fields. As of 2022, the six-year undergraduate graduation rate was 83% and the first-year student retention rate was 89%. The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education classified Saint Joseph&#x27;s among &quot;Master&#x27;s Colleges and Universities (larger programs)&quot;.

The university also has 14 centers and institutes, which include the Academy of Food Marketing, The Barnes Arboretum at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, Center for Addiction and Recovery Education, Center for Professional Development, Faith-Justice Institute, Institute for Environmental Stewardship, Institute for Jewish-Catholic Relations, Institute of Clinical Bioethics, Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support, Maguire Academy of Insurance and Risk Management, Pedro Arrupe, S.J., Center for Business Ethics, Philadelphia Regional Institute for STEM Educators and Substance Use Disorders Institute.

The university has an undergraduate honors program, housed in Claver House.

===Rankings===
==Campus==


Saint Joseph&#x27;s University&#x27;s main campus, often referred to as Hawk Hill, is located on City Avenue, which splits the university between the western edge of Philadelphia and Lower Merion Township. Portions of the property are in the Lower Merion side.

On June 1, 2022, as a result of the merger with University of the Sciences, Saint Joseph&#x27;s acquired a second major campus. The University City campus covers approximately 24 acres of urban landscape in the section of West Philadelphia known as University City, which also encompasses the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University.

The university&#x27;s official mailing address is in Philadelphia. A bridge that spans City Avenue connects the two sides of the main campus. Its are concentrated from Cardinal Avenue to 52nd Street and Overbrook Avenue to City Avenue. The university also owns several buildings that are not on the main campus. With the acquisition of the Maguire Campus, one half of the are located on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. In all, there are 99 buildings on the university&#x27;s campus.

St. Joe&#x27;s is within of La Salle University, Harcum College, Rosemont College, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Temple University, Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, Philadelphia University, Eastern University, Cabrini College, and Villanova University. SEPTA regional rail train stations on each side of campus provide students with easy access to Center City.

===Main campus===
The main campus is located on the Philadelphia side of City Avenue between Cardinal and Overbrook Avenues and 52nd Street, and is the original location of the university when it moved to City Avenue in 1927. Saint Joseph&#x27;s most recognizable building is Barbelin Hall, opened in 1927. The hall is known for its Gothic architecture, particularly the gargoyles that mark what is called the Barbelin Quadrangle (or Barbelin Courtyard) and the tall, four-spired bell tower that can be seen from miles away. The bell tower that sits atop Barbelin served as the university&#x27;s logo for several years. Barbelin Hall was built by John McShain, who constructed The Pentagon and the Jefferson Memorial.

The Hawk Hill campus features Barbelin Hall (College of Arts &amp; Sciences), Mandeville Hall (Haub School of Business), Bellarmine Hall, Post Hall, and the Science Center as the main academic halls. Green spaces on campus include St. Mary&#x27;s, Claver House, and Wolfington lawns located on the Main Campus, in addition to two quadrangles, College Hall Quad and Barbelin Quad. Barbelin Hall is also home to the university&#x27;s Office of Public Safety &amp; Security on the Hawk Hill campus.

The Post Learning Commons is the university&#x27;s main library, the result of a renovation of the original Francis A. Drexel Library and an expansion project called the Post Learning Commons, from 2011 to 2013. Drexel Library and Post Learning Commons are connected via a glass atrium and bridge through the heart of campus. The Post Learning Commons houses approximately 355,000 volumes, 1,450 print journals, 15,000 full-text electronic journals, 2,800 e-books, 866,000 microforms, and 4,975 audio-visual materials. Unique to the Post Learning Commons is the Campbell Collection in Food Marketing.

In September 2012, the university purchased the adjacent Cardinal&#x27;s Residence on 54th and Cardinal Avenue from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Beginning with the fall 2014 semester, the Cardinal&#x27;s Residence was renamed the Maguire Wolfington Welcome Center. It serves as a welcome center for prospective families and has offices for all enrollment management operations.

Campion Student Center is the hub for student activities, student life administrative offices, and dining facilities. The student center within Campion also features the Doyle Banquet Halls, Forum Theater, and President&#x27;s Lounge used for larger gatherings and lectures on campus. Located just off Campion Student Center is Simpson Hall, which houses the Student Media Center and The Perch, a 24-hour student lounge. In 2023, the dining facilities were renovated, with the new dining facility being named &quot;The Kettle&quot;. The Kettle utilizes the concept of ghost kitchens and mobile ordering, and offers dining options such as Auntie Anne&#x27;s, Jamba Juice, Food Lab, and Hawk Wrap. Two retail spaces were also added to The Kettle, Moe&#x27;s Southwestern Grill and Bento Sushi. The Kettle also offers a separate large dining area with buffet-style food.

===James J. Maguire &#x27;58 Campus===
On August 8, 2008, Saint Joseph&#x27;s completed the acquisition of the adjacent Episcopal Academy after purchasing the property in 2005. The new 38-acre area (150,000 m2) was named the Maguire Campus for the lead donor, Saint Joseph&#x27;s alumnus James Maguire. The Maguire Campus is located directly across from the Main Campus on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. The Maguire Campus features three main academic buildings: Merion Hall, Connelly Hall, and Toland Hall. Merion Hall is the largest of the three.

The Cardinal John Foley Center, a multi-use space, hosts lectures, concerts, and social gatherings, in addition to large-scale admission events. The Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support, established in 2009, was made possible with donations totaling over $8 million, and is located in Connelly Hall. Duperreault, Quinn, and Windrim Halls are campus houses serving as administrative space for University Advancement.

Athletic facilities include the Michael A. O&#x27;Pake, Esq. &#x27;61 Recreation Center, Ellen Ryan Field (field hockey), John Smithson Field (baseball), Curran Lawn, and a softball field.

There are over 600 different species of trees on the Maguire Campus.

===Overbrook Campus===
The Overbrook Campus is located about a mile from and Main Campus, near Overbrook Train Station. Here also Saint Joseph&#x27;s University owns buildings on both sides of City Avenue. Currently the campus holds two dorms, reserved exclusively for sophomores. These dorms are the Ashwood Apartments and the Merion Gardens Apartments. The campus also holds the Alumni House.

=== University City Campus ===

The University City Campus is bordered on one side by Clark Park and on another by The Woodlands, an historic cemetery that now serves as a large urban park with walking and bicycle trails. The campus comprises 24 buildings, including academic halls, laboratories, mixed-use and dedicated residence halls, as well as open spaces and athletic venues.

The university&#x27;s second library, the J.W. England Library, was acquired in the University of the Sciences merger. The England Library contains specialized information regarding pharmacy, pharmacognosy, pharmaceutics and foreign drug compendia. Other areas of specialization include toxicology, pharmacology and physical therapy. In total, the library houses more than 470,000 volumes, with an annual circulation of approximately 5,680. The library is also a member of the Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM), which is administered under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Among its collection are the holdings of the Leopold Helfand Rare Book and Archives Room, which include seventeenth and eighteenth-century botanicals, books once belonging to Benjamin Franklin and Sir Isaac Newton, as well as the theses of Dr. Eli Lilly, Sir Henry S. Wellcome and Silas M. Burroughs, written in their own hand.

===Housing===
First-year students on Hawk Hill can choose from traditional residence halls (McShain Hall and Villiger Hall) or suite-style residence halls (Sourin Residence Center and LaFarge Residence Center). Villiger Hall, the university&#x27;s newest residence, opened in August 2012. Sophomores can choose to live in several campus houses or apartments. On the University City Campus, students may choose to live in the Living &amp; Learning Commons.

===Current developments and plans===
In 2018, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University announced that it had entered into an educational collaboration with The Barnes Foundation. The Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation, located next to the Hawk Hill Campus, would have facilities and operations handled by Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, while the Barnes Foundation would continue to oversee historic buildings and the Arboretum. In May 2023, the university opened the Maguire Art Museum within the Arboretum after renovating many aspects of the building. The museum collaboration has been attributed by the university to a historical $50m gift made in 2017 by alumnus James Maguire (&#x27;58).

In March 2022, the university&#x27;s planned merger with the University of the Sciences was approved by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. On June 1, 2022, the merger took effect, and the University of the Sciences merged with Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, joining it.

Additionally, in May 2022, the university announced SOAR: The Campaign for Saint Joseph&#x27;s University. The largest fundraising campaign in the university&#x27;s history, the campaign seeks to raise $300 million in order to improve the campus experience, affirm their commitment to financial aid, and to continue to improve and develop academic programs and research initiatives. Nearly a year later, the university announced that over half of the money sought by the campaign, $152 million, had been raised. As part of the campus plan, construction began on a new residence hall in Fall 2023, which the university named after Sister Thea Bowman. Additional on-campus construction and developments are listed on the university&#x27;s Campus Master Plan.

In January 2023, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University announced a planned merger with Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences in January 2024. With this merger, the university announced that it would be launching an undergraduate nursing program on Hawk Hill in 2024. The merger marks the third campus location for Saint Joseph&#x27;s University. The university will add nearly 2,000 additional students from the PA College community to the Saint Joseph&#x27;s community.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s University recognizes eleven social Greek organizations and six co-educational, professional Greek organizations. Approximately 21% of undergraduates are affiliated with a social fraternity or sorority. No Greek housing is provided by the university.

==Athletics==
Saint Joseph&#x27;s University is the home of the Hawks, its athletics program. The school colors are crimson and gray. SJU fields teams in 20 varsity sports in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Hawks are part of the Atlantic 10 Conference. Since the Atlantic 10 does not support men&#x27;s lacrosse, the Hawks play in the Northeast Conference for that sport only.

Along with the Atlantic 10, Saint Joseph&#x27;s is a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, which intensifies local rivalries within Philadelphia city schools. Its effect on Saint Joseph&#x27;s causes intense games with Temple University, Villanova University, the University of Pennsylvania, and inter-conference rival LaSalle University.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s is also a member of the City 6. Similar to the Big 5, the City 6 comprises the entire Philadelphia Big 5 plus Drexel University, which did not participate in Division I athletics until 1973. In addition to official team rivalries, the local colleges also compete in various extramural sporting events to crown a City 6 Champion.

===The Hawk mascot===
One of the most famous mascots in college sports, the Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hawk, has been flapping its wings for over 50 years. Jim Brennan originated the idea for a hawk as mascot during the 1954–1955 season. Brennan, a former Marine and SJU cheerleader, at first wanted to secure an actual hawk, but later switched to the costume idea. The student government raised the $120 needed to buy the initial costume, which Brennan donned for three years. He made his debut as the Hawk on January 4, 1956, at a 69–56 win over La Salle University at the Palestra.

The Hawk is best known for staying in constant motion by flapping its wings throughout every basketball game, and for representing the Saint Joseph&#x27;s motto, &quot;The Hawk Will Never Die&quot;. It is also recognized by its &quot;flying&quot; in figure eights around the court during timeouts.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

While Saint Joseph&#x27;s fields 20 NCAA sports, the university&#x27;s most popular sport is men&#x27;s basketball. Saint Joseph&#x27;s has a rich basketball tradition. Most home games are played at Hagan Arena on the school&#x27;s campus, while some games are played at the Palestra on the University of Pennsylvania campus.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s major rival is Villanova University. The rivalry is known as the Holy War, although starting in 2013 both schools requested that the media refrain from using the term. The school also maintains intense rivalries with the other Philadelphia universities.

Fans of the Hawks often chant &quot;The Hawk Will Never Die!&quot;. Since the school&#x27;s undefeated regular season, this chant has gained familiarity with the team&#x27;s opponents. In 2003, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed that cheer among &quot;The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)&quot;, calling it &quot;the most defiant cheer in college sports.&quot;
===Athletic facilities===

*John Smithson Field: Named after alum and former interim president John Smithson, the Hawks on-campus baseball field opened in 2012 on Maguire Campus. It features a synthetic surface with a dirt pitching mound and an AstroTurf 3D GameDay Grass surface. Bleacher seating capacity is 400 with much more space for standing room only.
*SJU Softball Field: The softball team opened their on-campus field in 2012. It features a turf outfield and bleacher seating for 400 spectators.
*Robert Gillin Jr., Boathouse: Saint Joseph&#x27;s University celebrated its sesquicentennial anniversary in 2000–01. In conjunction with that celebration, the SJU Rowing Program, along with Saint Joseph&#x27;s Prep, kicked off a capital campaign to finance the construction of a state-of-the-art boathouse on the Schuylkill River. The boathouse provides a permanent home for the Hawk rowing programs. In addition, it provides the university with a significant presence on Kelly Drive. Named in honor of Robert Gillin Jr., groundbreaking for the facility took place in the fall of 2001. The total cost for the project was approximately $3 million, plus an endowment fund to support ongoing operational costs.
*Sweeney Field: Laid out in a natural bowl in the center of Saint Joseph&#x27;s campus, Sweeney Field (formerly known as Finnesey Field) is the home field of Hawk soccer, lacrosse, and field hockey teams. Originally constructed for football and opened in 1929 with plans for an eventual 70,000-seat stadium, the field has undergone numerous changes over the years.
*Tennis Complex at the Maguire Campus: The tennis team moved to the six refurbished courts on the Maguire Campus in 2009 with the first SJU Invitational.
*Finnesey Courts: Adjacent to Sweeney Field stand the Finnesey Courts and home to the Hawk men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis teams from the late 1940s until 2009. Prior to that SJU primarily played its home matches at the nearby Narberth courts. When courts were first built on campus, they were located where Bellarmine Hall now stands. Due to Bellarmine&#x27;s construction in the summer of 1960, however, the Finnesey courts were torn down and rebuilt in their current location. These courts are still used by students.

*Michael J. Hagan Arena: The on-campus home of the Hawks basketball teams was originally named Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse for the Saint Joseph&#x27;s graduates who gave their lives in World War II. The building was officially dedicated on November 11, 1949, and two weeks later played host to its first basketball game, a 62–46 loss to Rhode Island on November 26. Following that initial setback, SJU would go on to win the next 23 games in the friendly confines of the Fieldhouse. Overall, the Hawks have compiled an impressive 305–76 record (80.0 winning percentage) on Hawk Hill. Among the highlights of the Hawks&#x27; home court advantage was a 34-game winning streak from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, an 11–0 record in 2000–01, and the unbeaten 11–0 mark as the Hawks made their perfect season run in 2003–04. All told, SJU has had only two losing records in the Fieldhouse over 57 seasons. The Fieldhouse held 3,200 fans but the arena has a capacity of 4,200. Martin Luther King Jr., spoke at the Fieldhouse in the 1960s.
*Ellen Ryan Field: The field hockey team returned to campus after a multi-year hiatus with the addition of Ellen Ryan Field on the Maguire Campus in 2011. Ryan Field has a synthetic AstroTurf12 pitch and is situated adjacent to City Avenue.
*Athletic/Recreation Center (ARC): Located on the University City Campus, the ARC serves as the main athletic facility for students at the UCity campus. Featuring 78,000 square feet of space, the facility includes an indoor track, basketball court, gym equipment, and multiple rooms in which events are able to be hosted.

The university also has a four-court multi-purpose area for basketball, tennis, and volleyball, an indoor four-lane jogging track, an esports lab on the Hawk Hill campus, four racquetball courts, locker rooms and saunas, and nine outdoor tennis courts.

<text>Yvonne Maria Therèse van Gennip (born 1 May 1964) is one of the most successful female Dutch all-round speed skaters. Her main success dates from the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, where she unexpectedly won three gold medals. She was the most successful athlete at the 1988 Winter Olympics, along with Matti Nykänen of Finland.

After she had injured her foot, and had surgery less than two months before the games, the East German women were heavily favoured to win the distances over 500 meters. But Van Gennip smashed the world record by almost five seconds to win the 3000 metres, beat her personal record by almost 4 seconds to win the 1500 metres, and was almost seven seconds faster than her own world record time to win the 5000 metres as well.

Van Gennip participated in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo and in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville as well, but did not win a medal. She won a silver medal in the 1988 World Speed Skating Championships, and bronze medals in the 1987 and 1989 World Championships.

== Early life ==
Van Gennip was born on 1 May 1964 in Haarlem, the daughter of Johannes Gerardus van Gennip (22 April 1922 – 30 September 1999) and Reina Elisabeth Mettes (20 May 1924 – 15 March 2013).

She married bank director Gert van Kuijk on 15 August 2002 in Zandvoort, the couple divorced in 2009. Since 2010 she has been in a relationship with Jaap de Groot, lead editor for sports for &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;.

<doc id="454586" wikidata="Q752883" url="?curid=454586" title="Mechanical Animals">
<text>Mechanical Animals is the third studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on September 15, 1998, by Interscope Records. The album marked a major shift from the industrial metal and alternative metal styles of the band&#x27;s earlier efforts, into an experimentation with 1970s glam rock with industrial rock, gothic metal and electronic rock styles. As their first release following the success of their breakthrough album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;″ themes primarily deals with the trappings of fame and drug abuse.

A rock opera and concept album, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is the second installment in a trilogy which included &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and 2000&#x27;s &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot;. After the release of &quot;Holy Wood&quot;, Manson said that the overarching story within the trilogy is presented in reverse chronological order; &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, therefore, acts as the bridge connecting the two narratives and remains constant whether the trilogy is viewed in reverse or not.

The album has been certified platinum in the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. It spawned the singles &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)&quot; as well as the promotional single, &quot;Coma White&quot;. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the first Marilyn Manson album to do so.

==Recording and production==
===Aborted sessions with the Dust Brothers===

Following the conclusion of their year-long Dead to the World Tour in September 1997, the band relocated from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Hollywood, California. Work on &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; began soon after. By early December of that year, the singer began opening up on the then new and unnamed record&#x27;s development, sitting down with MTV&#x27;s &quot;Year in Rock&quot; special on December 12. Early on, it was reported the new album would be produced by the Los Angeles-based production team, the Dust Brothers. According to MTV News, &quot;[They] have completed work on a few tracks on the next effort from Marilyn Manson...&quot;

During this early development stage, the band recorded in Manson&#x27;s home recording studio in the Hollywood Hills which the group had taken to calling &quot;The White Room&quot; after the vocalist painted the space white. Manson explained that the studio &quot;looked out over Hollywood, which kind of represented space to us.&quot; Manson also intoned, &quot;the theme of whiteness comes up a lot on the album, representing a void empty of color and feelings and emotions. We were trying to fill that void with the songs.&quot;

===Billy Corgan involvement===
Manson&#x27;s friend, the Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, served as an unofficial music consultant for the band. After playing a few of the early songs for him, Corgan advised that &quot;This is definitely the right direction&quot; but to &quot;go all the way with it. Don&#x27;t hint at it.&quot; Despite this, almost 20 years after the release of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy (who left the band in the intervening years) disputed &quot;arrogant-yet-whiny ass&quot; Corgan&#x27;s involvement and claimed &quot;the majority&quot; of the album was &quot;written long before Billy Corgan ever showed up.&quot; He went on to describe Corgan as pretentious and &quot;thinks he&#x27;s Brian Eno.&quot;

===Sessions with Michael Beinhorn and Sean Beavan===
The band subsequently employed Michael Beinhorn as principal producer, co-producing the record with Marilyn Manson. Sean Beavan was also brought in to supply additional production work. According to Manson, the bulk of the material was written and recorded at that house before Beinhorn came on board. &quot;For the most part, I had a very specific vision of what I wanted to do and how to do it.&quot;

By May of that year, having completed his obligations for Hole&#x27;s then-new album, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, Beinhorn confirmed that the nascent Manson project was halfway complete and on course for a late summer or early fall release. Manson, for his part, spent the early part of the year on break from the studio to promote his autobiography, &quot;The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell&quot;.

During his February 24, 1998, interview on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot; radio talk show to promote the book, he divulged that having exhausted the topic of organized religion in the previous record, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; would see a major shift in focus: &quot;Both sonically and lyrically it&#x27;s about the depression of alienation, rather than the aggressiveness of it. It&#x27;s about the emptiness.&quot; Guitarist Zim Zum divulged that in one instance the band recorded a song a day for two weeks straight during a particular spree of creativity.

Final mixing and post-production took place in a studio in Burbank, California. In July 1998, after having contributed guitar work to 12 of the album&#x27;s 14 tracks, Zim Zum left the band under amicable terms to pursue his own solo project. He was replaced by the former guitarist of English industrial metal band 2wo, John Lowery (rechristened by the band as John 5).

==Concept and themes==

In the album, Manson takes on the role of a glam rocking, substance-addicted, gender ambiguous &quot;alien messiah&quot; called &quot;Omēga&quot;. Much like David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, he falls down to earth, is captured, placed with a band called &quot;The Mechanical Animals&quot; and turned into a rock star product. He has become numb to the world, either lost or high in outer space or the Hollywood Hills, through excessive drug use as a coping mechanism with his life as a product of his corporate masters. Manson&#x27;s other role is that of &quot;Alpha&quot; who is based on himself and his experiences around the conclusion of the &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; tour/era. Acting as Omēga&#x27;s foil, Alpha&#x27;s emotions have only begun seeping back. Vulnerable and trying to relearn how to use them properly, he despairs about how little emotion other people feel, observing them to be &quot;mechanical animals&quot;.

&quot;There is a bit of a love story that exists on this record,&quot; Manson admits. &quot;The name I gave to the thing I was in love with was Coma White. It starts as the name of a girl I&#x27;m in love with, then ends up to really be a drug I&#x27;ve been taking. So I&#x27;m not really sure what I&#x27;m in love with.&quot;

Subsequently, seven of the 14 songs are from the perspective, lyrically and musically, of Omēga and his fictional band The Mechanical Animals, while the other seven are by Alpha (Marilyn Manson). The Omēga songs are typically those most nihilistic and superficial lyrically, such as &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, &quot;User Friendly&quot; and &quot;New Model No. 15&quot;. The album artwork features a dual liner note book, in which one half has lyrics for the Omēga songs, and when flipped over, has those for the Alpha songs.

Marilyn Manson later noted in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that &quot;&quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; was to represent the point where the revolution got sold out, a hollow shell of what the essence of Marilyn Manson was. It was a satire, and a lot of people interpreted it as &#x27;This is what he really is.&#x27; I was making a mockery of what I was, taking a shot at myself.&quot;

After the release of &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot;, Marilyn Manson revealed that his concept album trilogy is an autobiographical story told in a reverse timeline (chronologically reverse from their actual release dates). That means &quot;Holy Wood&quot; opens the storyline followed by &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; and concluded with &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. Further, though &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; made sense as individual concept albums on their own, there was a hidden overarching story running through the three releases. In transitioning from &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; to &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot;, Manson admitted that the character of Omēga, &quot;[...] was a ruse to lure commercial mall-goers into the web of destruction – I&#x27;ve always planned that from the beginning.&quot;

==Composition and style==

&quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; marked a major shift away from the abrasive and aggressive industrial and alternative metal styles of the band&#x27;s previous work. Manson explained that he had grown &quot;bored&quot; with that musical aesthetic adding that, &quot;Everything you hear nowadays is an offshoot of NIN, Marilyn Manson, Ministry. There&#x27;s just no great rock albums anymore. There&#x27;s a lot of rock music out there, but it&#x27;s very bland and disposable. A lot of people may say this record is over the top, pretentious and theatrical, but that&#x27;s what rock music is supposed to be about.&quot; &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; also marked the first time NIN frontman Trent Reznor provided no production input. In both music and imagery, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; draws heavily from the glam rock genre that dominated the UK Charts in the early 1970s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted the songs are marked by shimmering, flamboyant guitar grooves and strong melodic hooks while the lyrics &quot;trade the topic of teen satanism for drug-addled space themes and sci-fi love stories&quot;, reflecting &quot;Manson&#x27;s self-proclaimed new &#x27;glitterati&#x27; lifestyle.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Manson&#x27;s crooning as evocative of &quot;the sultry vibe of T. Rex&#x27;s Marc Bolan&quot;. However, both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that while the album drew from glam rock, it did not revel in the &quot;naughty-boy insouciance&quot; and playful hedonism of the genre despite numerous references to drugs, decadence and lurid sexual escapades. Rather, it was &quot;glum and pessimistic&quot; and more preoccupied with the themes of alienation, insincerity and longing (through sci-fi allusions) only hinted at by the genre.

&quot;I just wanted to approach this album from a different point of view. I&#x27;d assumed the role of destroyer on the last record. This role is more a savior. I wanted to write songs that were more personal and dealt with specific emotions. The music had to really compliment that, but there wasn&#x27;t a conscious effort to make more accessible songs. There was simply an effort to write songs that would make people feel differently to the songs on the last album. In a sense that makes it more accessible, but it&#x27;s not just for the sake of pop. Even if it was, that&#x27;s okay too. I can appreciate the Spice Girls and Garth Brooks in the Andy Warhol sense of it - pop art.&quot;

Its ultimate sources are the goths: Bauhaus, Love and Rockets, and early Cure. &#x27;The Speed of Pain&#x27;, meanwhile, is redolent of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &#x27;Welcome to the Machine&#x27;.
The song &quot;Great Big White World&quot; raised concerns, among some groups, of possibly being a racially motivated reference until Manson himself cleared up the rumors by stating that it was about cocaine. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)&quot; features guitar work by Dave Navarro.

==Release and artwork==
At a time before the ubiquity of peer-to-peer file sharing, the first singles from both Beinhorn-produced albums were leaked three weeks before their intended release dates and played &quot;nearly a dozen times&quot; on New York radio station WXRK (92.3 FM) and its Los Angeles-based sister station, KROQ-FM (106.7 FM), on the weekend of July 31 to August 2, 1998. Interscope neither confirmed nor denied that the leak originated from them but joined Hole&#x27;s label, DGC Records, in issuing a cease and desist order to WXRK on August 3.

In spite of this the Manson single, &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, was subsequently recorded and converted by a fan into an MP3 and made available on an unofficial fan site for download soon after. The following weekend, San Francisco radio station Live 105 (105.3 FM) played both singles again.

===Artwork and packaging===

The controversial cover art has won critical acclaim and numerous awards. The infamous photo depicts Manson as an androgynous naked figure with breasts, six fingers and airbrushed genitalia. It is the brainchild of New York City-based photographer Joseph Cultice. Designer Paul Brown has said of the cover, &quot;I&#x27;m extremely proud of it. I said more in one of his covers than any novel could. It made people think and cringe.&quot; In 2003, VH1 included &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; at number 29 in its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Album Covers&quot;. It is also featured in Grant Scott&#x27;s book &quot;The Greatest Album Covers of All Time&quot;.

Contrary to popular internet rumors, the band leader, Manson, did not undergo any plastic surgery for this androgynous, alien look. The breasts are prosthetic, manufactured specially by Screaming Mad George&#x27;s SMG Effects (now out of business). Manson is, in reality, naked and covered head to toe in latex paint, provided by the same movie make-up company. His genitalia are covered by a foam latex appliance to create the androgynous appearance of the alien figure he calls Omēga, which, the singer explained, represents &quot;sexlessness and vulnerability,&quot; in addition to his own &quot;affection for prosthetic limbs.&quot; Originally the make up consisted of six breasts with nipples. Manson has stated in interviews that his friend, actor Johnny Depp, is the current owner of these prosthetic breasts, which Manson traded for Depp&#x27;s strawberry-blonde wig worn in the 2001 film &quot;Blow&quot;.
&quot;Kerrang!&quot; noted that the cover art text forms an anagram for &#x27;Marilyn Manson Is An Alchemical Man&#x27;. The album also features an alternate, less &quot;obscene&quot; cover which is contained on the reverse side of the album liner notes. It is incidentally the cover for an album of the same name by Omēga and the Mechanical Animals, a fictitious band composed of characters played by the members of Marilyn Manson. The photo featured on this alternative cover art includes more of the symbolism surrounding the numeral 15.

The liner notes also contain hidden messages in yellow text, which become viewable when seen through the blue CD packaging or the transparent blue LP. The reader of the liner notes is shown how to read these messages in the booklet: there is a diagram showing a CD case over the booklet, and a message which reads: &quot;Yellow and blue = green.&quot;

A limited tour edition of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; was released in the UK (including other locations like Australia and Mexico, where only 100 copies of this edition arrived) with an illustrated hardcover sleeve by Marcus Wild. Though limited edition, the album is easily attainable in certain regions. The packaging is identical to the original version except for the bonus eight-page comic book by Wild, illustrating scenes from the &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)&quot; music video.

===Retailer ban===

As early as August 14, 1998, a month before the release, the three largest retailers in the United States—K-Mart, Wal-Mart and Target—refused to stock the album citing the offensive cover and the expectation that it will carry a Parental Advisory sticker for violating their policy of not selling material with explicit lyrics or content. In an attempt to appease some of the retailers, Nothing and Interscope discussed plans to cover the &quot;breasts&quot; with a sticker and enclose the entire package in blue cellophane—similar to the brown paper bag tactic employed exactly 30 years before by distributors on the explicitly nude cover of John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins&quot;. Wal-Mart still refused to sell the album, and consequently pulled all previous albums by Manson in light of the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999.

In the intervening two decades since the release of this album, all three retailers have had a change of heart: 2003 saw the mass sale of Manson&#x27;s fifth LP, &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; in nearly all Wal-Marts; representatives claimed they chose to sell the album because it was &quot;commercially viable&quot; and was &quot;on the Top Ten charts.&quot; They now carry the band&#x27;s entire discography, including this record, in both their online and retail stores.

==Promotion and singles==
Five days before the album&#x27;s release, the band performed &quot;The Dope Show&quot; at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. The &quot;Ziggy-in-Vegas&quot; performance saw Manson strut into the stage in a blue vinyl coat with a faux-fur collar before stripping down, mid-way into the song, to a blue skin-tight costume with cut-outs that revealed the prosthetic breasts and androgynous genitalia of his Omēga character. The performance also included a trio of &quot;besequined&quot; back-up singers that harmonized with the frontman as he sang along. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that &quot;incontrovertibly, Marilyn Manson stole the show.&quot;

The album&#x27;s most successful song is &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, which fared well on both video and single charts in the United States and abroad. &quot;The Dope Show&quot; was written by Manson (lyrics) and Twiggy Ramirez (music). It continues to reign as the band&#x27;s most commercially successful song. The music video debuted the band&#x27;s controversial new, androgynous glam rock sound and image to the world. It is inspired by Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s art film &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; as well as the David Bowie film, &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth.&quot; Again, Bowie&#x27;s influence has been enormous on this album, with both influences noted publicly by Manson himself.

The third single, &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot;, was featured in the accompanying soundtrack of the film &quot;The Matrix&quot;—the song is played during the end credits.

===Tours===

Following the release of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, Marilyn Manson staged two worldwide stadium tours, titled the Mechanical Animals Tour and Rock Is Dead Tour.

A concert film was recorded depicting both tours, titled &quot;God Is in the TV&quot;. It was released on November 2, 1999, in VHS format by Interscope Records and features live concert footage of 13 songs culled from various concerts across the world as well as backstage and behind-the-scenes clips.

====Mechanical Animals Tour====
After declining a headlining slot at the Lollapalooza summer music festival (along with numerous other bands) in early 1998 due to delays in &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;″ release, the band launched the first of their own headlining tours in support of the album. It was originally intended to start on June 25, 1998, with a series of six festival dates in Europe lasting until July 12, 1998. However the planned summer European leg was scrapped and the tour&#x27;s launch date was rescheduled to October 25, 1998, after drummer Ginger Fish became ill with mononucleosis.

Beginning on October 25, 1998, and lasting until January 31, 1999, the Mechanical Animals Tour included two legs spanning a Fall to Winter World Tour in Europe, Japan, and North America and a 6 show headlining stint at the Big Day Out tour in Australia. In total, the band completed 46 shows out of the 52 originally planned.

====Beautiful Monsters Tour and Rock Is Dead Tour====
Beginning on February 28, 1999, and lasting until August 8, 1999, the tour included three legs spanning Europe, Japan and North America with a total of 9 completed shows for the Beautiful Monsters Tour and 43 completed shows (out of 46 planned) for the Rock Is Dead Tour.

The tour is particularly notable for a number of incidents that plagued its progress. Following the conclusion of the Mechanical Animals Tour in January 1999, the band was once again offered a headlining slot by the organizers of the Lollapalooza festival for the 1999 summer season (this time as part of an attempt to resurrect the by-then-defunct festival) which they declined. Instead, the band struck a deal with Hole to co-headline the latter&#x27;s Beautiful Monsters Tour. Immediately, the joint venture began experiencing problems due to disputes between both groups&#x27; leaders. After nine shows (spanning a total of two weeks) the tour imploded, resulting in Hole&#x27;s departure on March 14, 1999, and the tour being renamed Rock Is Dead. Monster Magnet, who were already opening for Manson, assumed Hole&#x27;s place on the tour&#x27;s playbill. A minor dispute erupted surrounding the tour&#x27;s revised nomenclature as Korn and Rob Zombie were already in the middle of another tour with the same name.

The first two performances of the Rock Is Dead Tour were canceled after Manson suffered a hairline fracture on one of his ankles during the final show with Hole at The Forum in Los Angeles. The tour was resumed on March 17, 1999. The tour, however, would stagger yet again following the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. In the ensuing aftermath, the band was accused of being a cause of the tragedy in Littleton, prompting the group to cancel their remaining North American engagements out of respect for the victims, explaining, &quot;It&#x27;s not a great atmosphere to be out playing rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll shows, for us or the fans.&quot;

==Critical reception==
The album received acclaim from most music critics. Analyzing the album&#x27;s intentions, Barry Walters of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; noted, &quot;&quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; celebrates sexy celebrity in a typically Mansonian bacchanalia of contradictions. He&#x27;s said all along that dirty media dominance is the cleanest and closest thing to divinity in a world that crucified the god in itself and replaced it with blind faith. Now he understands first-hand that stardom sucks, yet while he lifts a platform boot against its phony fat ass he still can&#x27;t help reveling in the excess. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; critiqued fame in order to make him famous. Having been there/done that, Manson wants more because more is the American way he&#x27;s hell-bent on subverting—even as he&#x27;s soaking in it.&quot; Of the record&#x27;s musical direction Walters noted, &quot;Flexing far more range than rage, Manson&#x27;s feminization shifts his vocal power center from a diseased gut to a broken heart. [...] Guitars roar and whine, bass booms, drums race, and synths twitter with a tweeness that&#x27;s gonna turn Durannie grannie Nick Rhodes&#x27;s gray roots green.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot; praised that &quot;Manson and producer Michael Beinhorn have rediscovered the adrenalin in &#x27;70s glam-rock, sprinkling Gary Glitter and Ziggy Stardust over Gothic theatrics.&quot; Jon Wiederhorn of Amazon observed that &quot;&quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is a brash, decadent, and glittery display of self-indulgent hooks and melodramatic vocals that sounds like Aladdin Sane-era David Bowie and T. Rex at their most boisterous crossed with the more modern sounds of today&#x27;s industrial nation.&quot; According to Ann Powers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;&quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; gets its cavelike spaciousness from [goth] influences and tweaks them with an industrial crunch [...] He and his band approach its terrain the way a 1960s rocker like Eric Clapton approaches the blues, with respect and a sense of entitlement.&quot; Annalee Newitz of &quot;Salon&quot; noted the band&#x27;s shift from a &quot;dour preoccupation with religious fascism and toward space-age genderfuck chic. The creamy synth sound and drugged-out lyrics that dominate Manson&#x27;s latest CD prove that two antithetical &#x27;80s musical genres—heavy metal and new wave—can indeed be fruitfully combined.&quot;

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Looking back in mascara&#x27;d anger, Manson and [producer Michael] Beinhorn have fashioned music steeped in glam rock and concept-album bombast but updated with a crunching intensity [...] He layers the songs with cooing backup singers, electronica burbles, skulking guitars, and synths at their most decadently new wavy. The effect is often spectacular.&quot; Lorraine Ali of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented &quot;songs swagger with lipstick-wearing attitude, have fun with sleazy subject matter and actually convey some (gasp) human emotion [...] This album is the first time we actually experience Manson as a band, not a phenomenon filtered through Reznor&#x27;s mixing board wizardry or a freak show accompanied by a soundtrack. An album that&#x27;s powerful from start to finish is far more surprising than any controversial Manson high jinks [...] this record ensures his further infiltration of teenage America and earns him a new spot in the annals of great, big, pompous pop albums.&quot; David Browne describes that the sound of the album &quot;is often spectacular: a lurid cabaret-rock revue for the post-global-economy meltdown.&quot; According to &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; &quot;marks a total shift in Manson&#x27;s assault. Where the Antichrist Superstar game plan was about gaining notoriety through outrage, rather than winning souls over on musical grounds, Mechanical Animals aims straight for the singalong heart of stadium-land. And rips it out, and holds it aloft in triumph [...] Of the 14 tracks here, ten could be singles. On this evidence alone, &#x27;Mechanical Animals&#x27; is an unashamedly crass bid for total world domination [...] they already have the goth kids. Now, their sights have turned on everyone else.&quot;

However, not everyone gave the album a positive review. Music critic Robert Christgau criticized &quot;the feebleness of La Manson&#x27;s vocal affect&quot; and dismissed the album as a whole as &quot;one more depersonalizing production device with which to flatten willing cerebella whilst confronting humankind&#x27;s alienation, amorality, and failure to have a good time on Saturday night.&quot; He concluded that &quot;not every icon deserves a think piece.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; magazine noted the record is &quot;essentially mining the same agitprop territory and &#x27;premillennial&#x27; confusion that hipster, highbrow heroes such as Alec Empire and Tricky take for granted. Manson shares with Empire a preference for destroying the master&#x27;s house with the master&#x27;s tools. Like Tricky, Manson uses gender confusion as a coping mechanism, less identity politics than identity evasion.&quot;

Joshua Klein of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; was unconvinced with the sudden musical shift by the band and pointed out that neither will longtime fans. However, he conceded that the album is &quot;more musical than anything Manson has done [...] His music packs both industrial muscle and anthemic conviction, even as it playfully steals from the Bowie songbook&quot; while lamenting that thematically the album played it safe, with lyrics lacking, &quot;any sense of wit, as songs doggedly hammer at safe taboos like drugs, sex, drugs, stardom, drugs, and death. And drugs.&quot; Like &quot;NME&quot;, Klein concluded the record will, nevertheless, help the band pick up new fans. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the record as &quot;a big, clean rock record&quot; and praised it as a &quot;welcome change of pace&quot; and &quot;more tuneful than his clattering industrial cacophony.&quot; However, he also noted that devoid of &quot;the cartoonish menace that distinguished his prior music [...] Marilyn Manson seems a little ordinary [...] Manson should have remembered—demons are never that scary in the light.&quot; Despite this, Greg Burk of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; went on to call &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; &quot;one of the greatest albums of its decade.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Spin&quot; ranked &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; the seventh best album on their 1998 End of Year List. Online music magazine &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot; ranked &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; 25th in their 1998 list of the &quot;Albums of the Year&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; 40th in their 1998 list of the &quot;Albums of the Year&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; second on their 1998 list of the Albums of the Year. &quot;Q&quot; magazine listed &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; among their picks for their 1998 Recordings of the Year list. Dutch magazine &quot;Muziekkrant OOR&quot; ranked &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; 18th in their 1998 &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; list. The record ranked second in the Critics Top 50 and 10th in the Popular Poll of German magazine &quot;Musik Express/Sounds&quot; in their 1998 &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; list. In 1999, American music journalist Ned Raggett listed &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; 78th in his &quot;The Top 136 Albums of the Nineties&quot;. Also in 1999, Australian magazine &quot;JUICE&quot; ranked &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; 84th in their &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;. In 2006, sister British magazines &quot;Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; in &quot;The 200 Greatest Albums of the 90s&quot;. Also in 2006, Dutch public radio broadcaster VPRO included &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; in their &quot;299 Nominations of the Best Album of All Time&quot;. The French edition of the British magazine &quot;Rock Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; 56th in their &quot;Top 150 Albums of Our Lifetime (1992–2006)&quot; and second in their 1998 &quot;Albums of the Year&quot;.

In the November 2003 issue of &quot;Blender&quot; magazine, author Chuck Palahniuk included the album in a list of his favourites, and said: &quot;I met Marilyn Manson on a magazine assignment, and he wanted my advice on a novel he&#x27;s writing. We drank absinthe once. I&#x27;ll probably go to his show when he&#x27;s in town next week. It&#x27;s so fascinating to see somebody exorcise his demons in such a public way.&quot;

==Commercial performance==

In the United States, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 223,000 units, becoming the band&#x27;s first number-one album on the chart. Propelled by both the first single&#x27;s heavy rotation on the radio and on MTV as well as the band&#x27;s main show performance at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, the record briefly displaced &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; for the number-one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The following week, the album dropped to number five with 98,200 copies sold. The album also debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 26,600 units in its first week in Canada.

Although critically acclaimed, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; was initially not too well received by longtime fans who complained about the wilfully radio-friendly sound of the album and surmised that Marilyn Manson had &quot;sold out&quot;. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 25, 1999, but was the lowest-selling number-one album of 1998 in the United States. Producer Beinhorn said: &quot;When &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; came out, the projected sales figure for the first week was 300,000 copies. [The label was] excited, saying, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to hit No.1 and sell 300k!&#x27;. It sold 230,000 and got to No.1, but it wasn&#x27;t enough. The label lost interest, they took down the huge billboard they had in Times Square for the album, the president of the label called Manson up, screaming at him for having tits on the cover. I think that, and what happened at Columbine, which really affected him emotionally, meant that he never made an album up to the standard of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; or &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; again. He just didn&#x27;t get the support.&quot; As of November 2010, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; sold 1,409,000 copies in the US.

==Track listing==

===CD version===
===Hidden multimedia track===
Notes
* Australian and Korean releases of the album come with an additional DVD that contains the music videos for &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;, &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;.
* This album features a hidden track, playable only on a computer; it is untitled and experimental, further playing on the album&#x27;s theme of the character Omēga and conformity. Upon entering the album into a computer, an autorun file starts a program that displays two of Manson&#x27;s paintings while the song plays in the background. It is thought to be an experiment in synesthesia.

===Vinyl version===
When released on vinyl, the record was split into two separately sleeved albums; the first credited to the character of Alpha (portrayed by Manson himself), pressed on opaque white vinyl, and the latter to Omēga and the Mechanical Animals on transparent blue vinyl. The Manson album dealt with songs of love and alienation, while the Mechanical Animals disc contained anthems of sex and drug use. The vinyl edition was reissued in 2012, but on black vinyl instead of white and blue. The track listing, however, remains the same.



Note
* Song length differs from CD version as tracks are not cross faded and appear in full length form with one- to two-second gaps between songs. Additionally, the intro to &quot;I Want to Disappear&quot; is tracked as the final 15 seconds of &quot;Posthuman&quot; on the CD while it appears as part of &quot;I Want to Disappear&quot; on the vinyl version.

<text>Portslade is a western suburb of the city of Brighton and Hove in the ceremonial county of East Sussex, England. Portslade Village, the original settlement a mile inland to the north, was built up in the 16th century. The arrival of the railway from Brighton in 1840 encouraged rapid development of the coastal area and in 1898 the southern part, formerly known as Copperas Gap, was granted urban district status and renamed Portslade-by-Sea, making it distinct from Portslade Village. After World War II the district of Mile Oak to the north was added. Today, Portslade is bisected from east to west by the old A27 road (now the A270) between Brighton and Worthing, each part having a distinct character.

== Geography ==

Portslade Village, to the north, nestles in a valley of the South Downs and still retains its rural character with flint buildings, a village green and the small parish church of St Nicolas, which is the second-oldest church in the city, dating from approximately 1150.

Portslade-by-Sea, to the south, has both the small but busy seaport harbour basin of Shoreham harbour and the industrial centre of Brighton and Hove. The east arm of Shoreham Canal Port, which includes the north and south basin quays, separates the pebble beach from the town centre. Terraced housing dating back to the 19th century is interspaced with parks and allotments. The main shopping area is on Station Road. Boundary Road in neighbouring Hove is the location of Portslade and West Hove station, with direct trains to with a journey time of just over an hour.

The adjacent areas of West Sussex are Southwick and Fishersgate with Fishersgate occurring south of the railway line. Fishersgate has its own railway station and like the Portslade station actually occurs at the boundary.

A notable building in the village is Portslade Manor, one of the few surviving ruins of a Norman manor. It was built in the 12th century and is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Foredown Tower houses a camera obscura, one of only two in the south of England. It is open to the public.

=== Portslade downland ===

To the north is Mile Oak and the A27 road which separates the built-up area from a number of special downland areas, which include Cockroost Hill to the northwest, Mount Zion to the northeast and Cockroost Bottom separating the two.

The name, Cockroost, may have come from the population of great bustard that used to inhabit the area. Although there are no longer bustards here, there is remarkable wildlife, including the rare moth &quot;Sitochroa palealis&quot;, orchids and butterflies. There is also a lot of history to be found on these slopes including a large 4000 year old Bronze Age settlement, which may have been a henge (as in Stonehenge), as well as evidence of Iron Age and Romano-British farming activity.

Mount Zion&#x27;s east slopes, north of New Barn Farm, are just as special. They have always been grazed and there are three coombes dotted with old anthills and orchids including the rare bee orchid. The most northerly coombe has the little copse with hazel and dogwood. Goldfinches, linnets and migrant birds on passage enjoy its peace.

There are two notable pathways on this downland. One is the Mid Sussex Path of the Sussex Border Path which separates East and West Sussex and runs north into the Fulking parish. There is also the final stretch of the Monarch&#x27;s Way which passes through Mile Oak and Porstlade and follows the seafront west towards Shoreham. The Way is a 625-mile (1,006 km) long-distance footpath that runs from Worcester to Shoreham.

==History==

Portslade has been suggested as being the Roman port Novus Portus mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s Geography of the 2nd century AD. Drove Road, in the original Portslade Village, has been linked with the Roman road (sometimes known as the &quot;London to Portslade Way&quot;) that passes through Patcham valley to Haywards Heath and on to Streatham in London. The Old Shoreham Road is thought to form part of the Chichester (&quot;Noviomagus Reginorum&quot;) to Portslade Roman road. Roman remains and a Roman burial site were found in Roman Road. The name of the town had been thought to stem from the Roman placename &quot;Portus Adurni&quot;, but this is based on a misidentification of Shoreham-by-Sea as &quot;Portus Adurni&quot; by Michael Drayton in the 17th century. Indeed, the River Adur, whose mouth has moved many times due to longshore drift and erosion, was also named from this misidentification. The actual etymology of Portslade may be &quot;portus-&quot; + &quot;-ladda&quot;, way to the port, where &quot;ladda&quot; is from the Old English for way, but this is conjectural at best.

Portslade was listed in Domesday Book of 1086 as having two households, and was under the tenancy of William of Warenne, having a value of six shillings.

The old name, Copperas Gap, for Portslade-by-Sea suggests that the coast was used for the production of copperas or green vitriol, a form of ferrous sulfate used extensively in the textile industry. The process took over six years and made use of iron pyrite-rich nodules that could be found in the strata of Sussex greensand stone that emerges at this point in the coast.

A part-finished assembly hall in Portslade became an Odeon Cinema about 1930 when George Coles, one of the Odeon chain&#x27;s principal architects, adapted the original design.

===19th-century residents===

Revd Richard William Enraght (1837–1898) was the Priest in Charge of St Andrew Church, Portslade, from 1871 to 1874. Fr. Enraght&#x27;s belief in the Church of England&#x27;s Catholic tradition, his promotion of ritualism in worship, and his writings on Catholic worship and church-state relationships led him into conflict with the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874. While serving as Vicar of Holy Trinity, Bordesley, Birmingham in 1880, he paid the maximum price under the Act of prosecution and imprisonment in Warwick Prison. Fr. Enraght became nationally and internationally known as a &quot;prisoner for conscience sake&quot;. In September 2006, Brighton &amp; Hove bus company honoured Fr. Enraght&#x27;s memory by naming one of their new fleet buses after him.

Edward Vaughan Hyde Kenealy QC (1819–1880) was an Irish born barrister, writer and poet who lived in Wellington Road, Portslade with his wife and eleven children from the 1850s until the mid-1870s. Kenealy commuted to London and Oxford for his law practice but returned at weekends and other times to be with his family. He chose Portslade because of his love of the sea, of which he wrote: &quot;Oh, how I am delighted with this sea-scenery and with my little marine hut ! The musical waves, the ethereal atmosphere, all make me feel as in the olden golden days when I was a boy and dreamed of Heaven&quot;. While living in Portslade he wrote the greater portion of his theological works.

===Administrative history===
Portslade was an ancient parish. In 1898 the parish was split into two; the more built-up southern part near the coast became an urban district and parish called &quot;Portslade-by-Sea&quot;, leaving a smaller northern parish covering the more rural areas and the old village, which kept the name Portslade. In 1921 the (northern) parish of Portslade had a population of 523. That Portslade parish was abolished in 1928 and added to the parish and urban district of Portslade-by-Sea.
Portslade-by-Sea Urban District Council built itself Portslade Town Hall on Victoria Road in 1928 to serve as its headquarters and as a community hall; it is now a locally listed building.

The urban district of Portslade-by-Sea was abolished in 1974, being absorbed into the borough of Hove. No successor parish was created for the area and so Portslade was directly administered by Hove Borough Council. The borough of Hove merged with neighbouring Brighton in 1997 to become the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove, which was awarded city status in 2000. Brighton and Hove City Council is therefore the only local authority which covers Portslade today.

<doc id="454592" wikidata="Q7767711" url="?curid=454592" title="The Swiss Family Robinson (1975 TV series)">
<text>The Swiss Family Robinson is an American action and adventure series that was broadcast during the 1975–76 TV season. The two-hour pilot for the series was first shown on April 15, 1975. Based upon the 1812 novel &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, the pilot and its 20 subsequent episodes of the series were produced by Irwin Allen, who had earlier produced a futuristic adaptation of the same novel in the 1965 TV series &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The series starred Martin Milner as Karl Robinson, the survivor of a shipwreck who found himself, his wife and two sons stranded on a volcanic island. In one of her first acting performances, Helen Hunt co-starred as a young girl who was stranded on the island from the same shipwreck and who was taken in by the Robinson family. Befriending the Robinsons was Jeremiah Worth (played by Cameron Mitchell), a sailor who had survived on the island alone for seven years following an earlier shipwreck.

The series was initially scheduled opposite NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; and CBS&#x27; &quot;Three for the Road&quot;. In December 1975, CBS replaced &quot;Three for the Road&quot; with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; which soon became a popular Sunday night staple. In addition to the tough competition, &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was preempted several times and showed repeat episodes four times during its short run. The final original episode was telecast on April 4, 1976.

Because the Canadian series of the same name had come first, this was shown in Britain and other international territories as &quot;Island of Adventure&quot;.

<doc id="454595" wikidata="Q368689" url="?curid=454595" title="First Serbian Uprising">
<text>The First Serbian Uprising (; ; ) was an uprising of Serbs in Orašac against the Ottoman Empire from 14 February 1804, to 7 October 1813. The uprising began as a local revolt against the Dahije, who had seized power in a coup d&#x27;état. It later evolved into a war for independence, known as the Serbian Revolution, after more than three centuries of Ottoman Empire rule and brief Austrian occupations.

In 1801, the Janissary commanders assassinated the Ottoman Pasha and took control of the Pashalik of Belgrade, ruling it independently of the Ottoman Sultan. This led to a period of tyranny, during which the Janissaries suspended the rights previously granted to the Serbs by the Sultan. They also raised taxes, imposed forced labour, and made other changes that negatively affected the Serbs. In 1804, the Janissaries feared that the Sultan would use the Serbs against them, which led to the assassination of many Serbian chiefs. An assembly chose Karađorđe to lead the uprising, and the rebel army quickly defeated and took over towns throughout the sanjak, technically fighting for the Sultan. Sultan Selim III, fearing their power, ordered all the Pashaliks in the region to crush them. The Serbs marched against the Ottomans and, after major victories in 1805–06, established a government and parliament that returned land to the people, abolished forced labour, and reduced taxes.

Serbia&#x27;s military successes continued over the years, spurred on by the Russian Empire&#x27;s involvement in the parallel Russo–Turkish War. However, disagreements arose between Karađorđe, who sought an absolute monarchy, and other leaders who wanted to limit his power because some of his colleagues abused their privileges for personal gain. After the Russo-Ottoman War ended in 1812, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of these circumstances and reconquered Serbia in 1813. 

Although the uprising was unsuccessful, the Serbs were the first Christian population in Ottoman history to rise up against the Sultan and succeed in creating a short-lived independent state. Their uprising eventually became a symbol of the nation-building process in the Balkans and inspired unrest among neighbouring Balkan peoples. The uprising soon resumed with the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815.

== Background ==
Serbia had been under Ottoman rule since the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Over the centuries, the Serbs experienced oppression, heavy taxation, and cultural assimilation under the Ottoman Empire. By the 18th century, the conditions for Serbs living under Ottoman rule had become increasingly harsh. In addition to high taxes, they faced discrimination and the imposition of the Devshirme system, which required Christian families to provide sons for the Ottoman military. The Serbs lived in wide areas in the western Balkans; a high percentage of them, experienced fighters, had fought under their own officers in the Serbian Freicorps of the Austrian army. They came from the Sanjak of Smederevo (also known in historiography as the Pashalik of Belgrade), a border district containing a population of around 368,000 prior to 1804. 

Belgrade, which was the seat of the eponymous pashalik became the second largest Ottoman city in Europe, with over 100,000 inhabitants, surpassed only by Constantinople. During the Austro-Turkish War of 1788, the eastern Šumadija region was occupied by the Austrian-Serbian Free Corps and Hajduks, which led to the occupation of most of the Sanjak of Smederevo by the Habsburg Monarchy (1788–1791). From 15 September to 8 October 1789, an Austrian force besieged the fortress of Belgrade. The Austrians held the city until 1791, when they returned it to the Ottomans under the terms of the Treaty of Sistova. The withdrawal was a disappointment for the Serbs, according to historian Theodor N. Trâpcea.

After the return of the sanjak to the Ottoman Empire, the Serbs expected reprisals from the Turks for their support of the Austrians. Sultan Selim III had entrusted the sanjaks of Smederevo and Belgrade to battle-hardened Janissaries who had fought against Christian forces during the Austro-Turkish War and other conflicts. Although Selim granted authority to the peaceful Hadži Mustafa Pasha in 1793, tensions between the Serbs and the Janissary command did not subside. In 1793 and 1796, Selim issued firmans that gave the Serbs more rights. These included the collection of taxes by the &quot;obor-knez&quot; (dukes), freedom of trade and religion, and the establishment of peace. Selim also ordered the removal of some unpopular Janissaries from the Belgrade Pashalik, as he saw them as a threat to the central authority of Hadži Mustafa Pasha. Many of the Janissaries were employed by or took refuge with Osman Pazvantoğlu, a renegade opponent of Selim in the Sanjak of Vidin. Pazvantoğlu launched a series of raids against the Serbs without the Sultan&#x27;s permission, causing much instability and fear in the region. In 1793, the Serbs defeated Pazvantoğlu at the Battle of Kolari. In the summer of 1797, Mustafa Pasha was appointed by the Sultan as the beglerbeg of Rumelia Eyalet. He left Serbia for Plovdiv to fight against the Vidin rebels of Pazvantoğlu. During Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s absence, Pazvantoğlu&#x27;s troops captured Požarevac and besieged the Belgrade Fortress. In November 1797, the Obor knez Aleksa Nenadović, Ilija Birčanin and Nikola Grbović arrived in Belgrade with their troops. They successfully forced the besieging Janissary troops to retreat to Smederevo.

On 30 January 1799, Selim III allowed the Janissaries to return, calling them local Muslims from the Sanjak of Smederevo. At first, the Janissaries accepted the authority of Hadži Mustafa Pasha. However, in Šabac, a Janissary named Bego Novljanin demanded a surcharge from a Serb and murdered him when he refused to pay. Fearing the worst, Hadži Mustafa Pasha marched to Šabac with a force of 600 men to ensure that the Janissary was brought to justice and that order was restored. The Janissaries not only decided to support Bego Novljanin, but Pazvantoğlu also attacked the Belgrade Pashalik in support of the Janissaries.

==Prelude==

On 15 December 1801, Belgrade Vizier Hadži Mustafa Pasha was executed by Kučuk-Alija, one of four Janissaries originally from the Sanjak of Vidin (modern north-western Bulgaria). Alongside Haji Mustafa Pasha. Mehmed Foça-oğlu, Aganli-Bayraktar and Mülla Yusuf, the four Janissaries referred to themselves as Dahije. As a result, Belgrade was captured and the Sanjak of Smederevo was divided among them independently of the Ottoman government, and in defiance of the Sultan, despite the dispatch of a new Pasha from Constantinople. 

The Janissaries enforced a system of arbitrary abuse unparalleled in the entire history of Ottoman misrule in the Balkans. The leaders divided the Sanjak into pashaliks, immediately suspending Serbian autonomy and significantly increasing taxes. Land confiscation and the introduction of forced labour, known as chiflik, prompted many Serbs to flee to the mountains. 

The Serbs petitioned the Sultan to inform him of the tyranny they were suffering, upon learning of this and in an attempt to prevent a rebellion, the Dahije decided to act first. At the end of January 1804, throughout the Sanjak, between 70 and 150 &quot;knezes&quot; (village leaders), livestock merchants and Orthodox priests were executed by the Dahije in an event known as the Slaughter of the Knezes. According to contemporary sources from Valjevo, the severed heads of the leaders were displayed on the central square as a warning to those who might plot against the Dahije&#x27;s rule. Janissary atrocities fueled fear and anger among the Serbs, leading some to flee with their families into the woods while others organised themselves into self-defence units, as uncoordinated resistance erupted throughout the region. 

The events in Serbia were being closely monitored by neighbouring Christian states such as Wallachia, an Ottoman client-state bordering Serbia to the northeast, and ruled by the Phanariote Prince Constantine Ypsilantis (who was secretly hostile to Ottoman rule). During the early stages of the rebellion, the Belgrade Pashalik was visited by Ypisilantis&#x27; agents, including Dositei Filitti.

==Uprising against the Dahije==
On 14 February 1804, a group of leading Serbs gathered at Marićević Gully, in the small village of Orašac (near Aranđelovac) to support a call for a general uprising. The meeting was held after the massacre and the resentment against the Dahije, who had revoked the privileges granted to the Serbs by Selim III. Among those present were Stanoje Glavaš, Atanasije Antonijević, and Tanasko Rajić. They elected Đorđe Petrović, a cattle trader known as Karađorđe, as their leader. Karađorđe, a former member of the Freikorps during the Austro-Turkish War and an officer in the national militia, had considerable military experience. Serbian forces quickly took control of Šumadija, leaving the Dahije with only Belgrade under their control. The Istanbul government ordered the pashas of the neighbouring Pashaliks not to help the Dahije. At first the Serbs fought on the side of the Sultan against the Janissaries, but later they were supported by an Ottoman official and the Sipahi cavalry corps. Despite their small numbers, the Serbs achieved significant military victories, capturing Požarevac and Šabac and launching successful attacks on Smederevo and Belgrade in quick succession.

In July 1804, the Sultan, fearing that the Serbian movement might get out of control, sent Bekir Pasha, former Pasha of Belgrade and now Pasha of Bosnia Eyalet, to officially help the Serbs, but in reality to keep them under control. Alija Gušanac, the Janissary commander of Belgrade, faced with both Serbs and imperial authority, allowed Bekir Pasha into the city. The Dahije had previously fled east to Ada Kale, an island in the Danube. Bekir demanded the surrender of the Dahije. Meanwhile, Karađorđe sent his commander, Milenko Stojković, to the island. The Dahije refused to surrender, so Stojković attacked and captured them. He had them beheaded on the night of 5–6 August 1804. After destroying the power of the Dahije, Bekir Pasha wanted the Serbs disbanded. However, since the Janissaries still held important towns such as Užice, the Serbs were unwilling to stop without guarantees. In May 1804, Serbian leaders under Đorđe Petrović met in Ostružnica to continue the uprising. Their goals were to seek protection from Austria, to petition Sultan Selim for greater autonomy, and to request Russian protection from the Russian ambassador in Istanbul. The Russian government maintained a neutral policy toward the Serbian revolt until the summer of 1804 due to the recent Russo-Turkish friendship, which was a response to the growing influence of France. At the beginning of the uprising, the Russian envoy in Montenegro refused to deliver the message when the Serbs asked for help and instructed the Serbs to petition the Sultan. However, in the summer of 1804, after the meeting in Ostružnica, the Russian government changed its policy to be recognized by Istanbul as the guarantor of peace in the region.

Negotiations between the Serbs and the Ottomans began in May 1804, mediated by the Austrian governor of Slavonia. As Trâpcea notes, the Serbs made only modest demands, seeking autonomy within the borders of the Pashalik. This autonomy was to be under the control of a Serbian knez with the power to collect taxes for the Sublime Porte. In addition, the Serbian leaders demanded further restrictions on the Janissaries. In 1805, negotiations between the Porte and the Serbs broke down over the Porte&#x27;s inability to accept an agreement guaranteed by a foreign power and the Serbs&#x27; refusal to lay down their arms. Fearing a Christian uprising, the Porte issued a decree on 7 May 1805, ordering the rebels to disarm and rely on regular Ottoman troops to protect them from the Dahije. The Serbs, however, summarily ignored the decree. Selim responded by ordering Hafiz Pasham, the Pasha of Niš, to march against the Serbs and take Belgrade.

==Uprising against the Ottomans==

In 1805, the first major battle took place at Ivankovac, where the Serbs defeated the Sultan&#x27;s army and forced it to retreat towards Niš. It was the first time that the Serbs defeated the Sultan&#x27;s army and not a Muslim rebel force. In November of the same year, the fortress of Smederevo fell and became the capital of the rebellion. The second major clash was the Battle of Mišar in 1806, where the rebels defeated an Ottoman army from Bosnia led by the Sipahi commander Suleiman-Pasa. The rebels also defeated Osman Pazvantoğlu and another Ottoman army sent from the southeast at Deligrad. Despite repeated efforts and the support of Ottoman commanders, including Ibrahim Bushati and Ali Pasha&#x27;s two sons, Muktar Pasha and Veli Pasha, the Ottomans were consistently defeated. In December 1806, the rebels, led by Petar Dobrnjac, captured Belgrade and gained control of the entire Pashalik. The rebels sent the Belgrade merchant Petar Ičko as their envoy to the Ottoman government in Constantinople. He succeeded in obtaining a favourable treaty named after him, the &quot;Ičko&#x27;s Peace,&quot; which granted a measure of Serbian autonomy. However, Serbian leaders rejected the treaty and may have poisoned Ičko for his dealings with the Ottomans.

In 1805, the Serbian rebels established a rudimentary government to administer the lands under Serbian control. The government was divided into the Narodna Skupština (People&#x27;s Assembly), the &quot;Praviteljstvujušči Sovjet&quot; (Ruling Council), and Karađorđe himself. The Ruling Council was established on the recommendation of Russian Foreign Minister Chartorisky and at the suggestion of some dukes, including Jakov and Matija Nenadović, Milan Obrenović, and Sima Marković. Their purpose was to check Karađorđe&#x27;s powers. Boža Grujović, the first secretary, and Matija Nenadović, the first president, envisioned the Council as the government of the new Serbian state. The revolutionary government was responsible for organizing and supervising various aspects of government, including administration, economy, army supply, law and order, justice, and foreign policy. In addition to abolishing forced labour and reducing taxes, they also abolished all feudal obligations in 1806, emancipating peasants and serfs and marking a major social break with the past. The poll tax on non-Muslims (jizya) was also abolished.

The Battle of Deligrad in December 1806 was a decisive victory for the Serbs, which boosted the morale of the outnumbered rebels. To avoid total defeat, Ibrahim Pasha negotiated a six-week armistice with Karađorđe. By 1807, the demands for self-government within the Ottoman Empire had evolved into a war of independence, supported by the Russian Empire. Combining patriarchal peasant democracy with modern national aspirations, the Serbian Revolution attracted thousands of volunteers among Serbs from across the Balkans and Central Europe. It eventually became a symbol of the nation-building process in the Balkans and provoked unrest among Christians in both Greece and Bulgaria. After a successful siege with 25,000 men in late 1806, Karađorđe proclaimed Belgrade the capital of Serbia on 8 January 1807, after the surrender of the remaining fortifications on St. Stephen&#x27;s Day. The Serbian efforts were supported by the Imperial Russian Army, which had established itself in Wallachia during the parallel Russo-Turkish War. This allowed the Serbian rebels to concentrate on the Timok Valley, deep in the Sanjak of Vidin. A local rebel named Hajduk Veljko pledged his allegiance to Karađorđe.

Earlier rebellions against the Ottoman Turks were suppressed with great violence and repression. In February 1804, the Janissaries executed seventy-two Serbs and displayed their heads on the citadel of Belgrade. These actions led to equally brutal reprisals when the situation was reversed. The liberation of Belgrade was followed by a massacre of Turks. The event was described by the Serbian historian Stojan Novakovic as a &quot;thorough cleansing of the Turks&quot;. After the Serbs finally stormed the fortress of Belgrade, Archbishop Leontii reported that the commander was killed &quot;as well as all other Muslim inhabitants&quot;; Turkish women and children were baptized. The slaughter was accompanied by widespread destruction of Turkish and Muslim property and mosques. A significant portion of those killed were not of actual Turkish descent, but were local Slavs who had converted to Islam over the centuries. The massacre sparked a debate within the rebel faction. The older generation of rebels viewed the massacre as a sin, but the prevailing principle was the removal of all Muslims.

In 1808, Sultan Selim was executed by Mustafa IV, who was subsequently deposed by Mahmud II. During this political crisis, the Ottomans were willing to offer significant autonomy to the Serbs. However, the talks did not lead to an agreement between the two parties, as they could not agree on the exact borders of Serbia. Karađorđe&#x27;s 1809 proclamation in the capital, Belgrade, is considered the culmination of the first phase. The proclamation called for national unity and invoked Serbian history to call for the establishment of religious freedom and a written rule of law. It also urged Serbs to stop paying taxes to the Porte, which were considered discriminatory on the basis of religious affiliation. Karađorđe declared himself the hereditary supreme leader of Serbia but agreed to cooperate with the Governing Council, which also served as the supreme court. During the Ottoman-Russian War of 1809, Karađorđe was initially willing to support Russia, but their cooperation proved ineffective. Although Karađorđe launched a successful offensive at Novi Pazar, Serbian forces were later defeated at the Battle of Čegar.In March 1809, Hurşid Paşa was sent to the Sanjak of Smederevo to suppress the rebellion. The Ottoman force was composed of soldiers from various nearby pashaliks, mostly from Bosnia and Albania (Scutari, Yanina), including soldiers such as Samson Cerfberr of Medelsheim, Osman Gradaščević, and Reshiti Bushati. On 19 May 1809, a large Ottoman force attacked 3,000 rebels led by commander Stevan Sinđelić on the hill of Čegar, near the town of Niš. Due to the lack of coordination between the commanders, the reinforcement of other detachments failed. Despite their numerical superiority, the Ottoman forces lost thousands of men in numerous attacks on the Serbian positions. Eventually, the rebels were overwhelmed, and their positions were overrun. To prevent his men from being captured and impaled, Sinđelić fired into the gunpowder magazine of his entrenchment, causing an explosion that killed all the rebels and Ottoman troops in the vicinity. Afterwards, Hurshid Pasha ordered the construction of a tower made from the skulls of Serbian revolutionaries. The resulting Skull Tower stands ten feet tall and contains 952 Serbian skulls embedded in 14 rows on all four sides.

In July 1810, Russian troops arrived in Serbia for the second time. This time they provided military cooperation by sending weapons, ammunition and medical supplies. Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov also participated in planning joint actions. Russian support raised hopes of a Serbian victory. In August 1809, an Ottoman army marched on Belgrade, causing a mass exodus of people across the Danube. Among them was the Russian agent Radofinikin. Faced with the impending disaster, Karađorđe sought help from the Habsburgs and Napoleon, but to no avail. At this point, the Serbian rebels shifted to a defensive strategy, focusing on holding their territories rather than making further gains. Meanwhile, Russia, preoccupied with a French invasion, prioritized signing a final peace treaty and acted against Serbia&#x27;s interests. In particular, the Serbs were not informed of the negotiations and only learned of the final terms from the Ottomans. This second Russian retreat occurred at the height of Karađorđe&#x27;s power and the rise of Serbian expectations. The Treaty of Bucharest, signed in May 1812, contained Article 8, which dealt with the Serbs. According to the treaty, Serbian fortifications were to be destroyed unless they were of value to the Ottomans. Pre-1804, Ottoman installations were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In return, the Porte promised a general amnesty and certain autonomous rights. The Serbs were granted control over the administration of their own affairs and the collection and payment of a fixed tribute. The reaction in Serbia was strong, with particular concern over the reoccupation of fortresses and towns and the expectation of feared reprisals.During the rebellion, some of the leaders abused their privileges for personal gain. Disagreements arose between Karađorđe and other leaders as Karađorđe sought absolute power while his dukes sought to limit it. After retaking Belgrade, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of the Russian retreat to reconquer Serbia in 1813. As part of this effort, Wallachia was also recaptured and secured by the Ottomans under the loyalist Phanariote John Caradja, along with its Great Banship (Oltenia). In July 1813, an Ottoman–Wallachian force, including &quot;several hundreds of Caradja&#x27;s Romanians&quot; arriving in through Oltenia, moved up the Timok River and killed Veljko at Negotin. The Ottoman forces burned villages along the main invasion routes, massacred or displaced their inhabitants, and enslaved many women and children. Karađorđe and other rebel leaders fled the country, and the exiles scattered throughout the Austrian Empire, Wallachia, and Russia.

==Aftermath==
As a clause of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Ottomans agreed to grant a general amnesty to the participants of the uprising. However, as soon as Turkish rule was re-established in Serbia, villages were burned and thousands were sent into slavery. Belgrade became the scene of brutal vengeance. On 17 October 1813 alone, 1,800 women and children were sold into slavery. Various acts of violence and confiscation of property also took place. Islamized Serbs and Albanians in particular participated in such actions.

Under direct Ottoman rule, all Serbian institutions were abolished. In 1814, tensions continued and Hadži Prodan, one of Karađorđe&#x27;s former commanders, launched a failed uprising. After an uprising at a Turkish estate in the same year, the Ottoman authorities massacred the local population and publicly impaled 200 prisoners in Belgrade. In March 1815, the Serbs held several meetings and organized to resist again. This led to the Second Serbian Uprising in April, led by Miloš Obrenović. The uprising eventually succeeded in turning Serbia into a semi-autonomous state.

<text>The Toledo Reforms were a series of reforms implemented by Francisco Álvarez de Toledo to Spain&#x27;s policies in the Viceroyalty of Peru in the 1570s.

The years 1533–1569 were considered the years of crisis and turmoil in the Viceroyalty of Peru. During these years there were several problems that emerged and that needed serious attention. The Spanish conquistadors found it hard to maintain order in the Andes. The problems that emerged during this time were the New Laws of 1542 that were established by Blasco Núñez Vela and the weakening of the &quot;encomienda&quot; system. These laws were established to put an end to the exploitation of Amerindians by the establishment of a fair taxation system. This angered the Spaniards because they felt that it was a direct interference in the lands that they won by force and because the laws hurt them from an economical standpoint. The weakening of the &quot;encomienda&quot; system also hurt the Spaniards economically. The New Laws reverted the encomienda to the King from the original holders who, had originally, wanted to pass them onto their descendants creating an almost aristocratic lineage. However, the King did not want their power and desire for it to get out of check. This system was weakened by competition from other Spanish economic ventures, tax and labor burdens of the &quot;encomenderos&quot;, and the spread of European epidemic diseases amongst the Andean peoples. This economic crisis needed serious attention.

To deal with the emerging problems, King Philip II of Spain named Francisco de Toledo, as the new Viceroy of Peru in 1568. During his twelve-year rule, he established reforms that he felt would deal with the economic crisis in the Andes. Francisco de Toledo&#x27;s reforms dealt with 3 key issues. The first was organizing the indigenous peoples into large towns called &quot;reducciones&quot;. The &quot;reducciones&quot; were then divided into 614 administrative districts called &quot;repartimientos&quot;. Each &quot;repartimiento&quot; was headed by a &quot;kuraka&quot;. The second issue was imposing a regularized system of taxation which was the tribute tax. The tax amount was very high. The tribute was to be paid by all indigenous men between the ages of 18 and 50 and the amount to be paid was based on the social status of the payer. The &quot;kurakas&quot; were exempt from paying the tribute and were responsible for collecting the tribute. The final issue was the establishment of a system of forced labor called the &quot;mita&quot;. The forced labor was used to work in the mercury and silver mines of Peru and Upper Peru. This system was established so that the wealth gained from these mines could be transferred to Spain.

<doc id="454605" wikidata="Q1916772" url="?curid=454605" title="Meena">
<text>Meena () is a tribe from northern and western India which is sometimes considered a sub-group of the Bhil community. It used to be claimed they speak Mina language, a 
spurious language. Its name is also transliterated as &quot;Meenanda&quot; or &quot;Mina&quot;. They got the status of Scheduled Tribe by the Government of India in 1954.

== Ethnography ==
The Meenas were originally a nomadic tribe. They were described as a semi-wild and hill tribe similar to the Bhils. But in the British Raj, for the fulfillment of its purpose by the British Government, they were described as a &quot;criminal tribe&quot; and listed according to the Criminal Tribes Act. Presently they are described as Scheduled Tribe by the Indian Government.

== Geography ==
Currently they are present in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana and the Union Territory of Delhi in India.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The Meenas claim a mythological descent from the Matsya avatar, or fish incarnation, of Vishnu. They also claim to be descendants of the people of the Matsya Kingdom, which flourished in the 6th century B.C. The historian Pramod Kumar notes that it is likely that the tribes living in the ancient Matsya kingdom were called Meena but it cannot be said with certainty that there is anything common between them and the modern Meenas. They are considered to be adivasi (aboriginal people).

Nandini Sinha Kapur, a historian who has studied early India, notes that the oral traditions of the Meenas were developed from the early 19th century AD in an attempt to reconstruct their identity. She says of this process, which continued throughout the 20th century, that &quot;The Minas try to furnish themselves a respectable present by giving themselves a &quot;glorious past&quot;&quot;. In common with the people of countries such as Finland and Scotland, the Meenas found it necessary to invent tradition through oral accounts, one of the primary uses of which is recognised by both historians and sociologists as being &quot;social protest against injustices, exploitation and oppression, a &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; that helps to retrieve the image of a community.&quot; Kapur notes that the Meenas not merely lack a recorded history of their own but also have been depicted in a negative manner both by medieval Persian accounts and records of the colonial period. From medieval times through to the British Raj, references to the Meenas describe them as violent, plundering criminals and an anti-social ethnic tribal group.

According to Kapur, the Meenas also attempt Rajputization of themselves.

=== Rajput period ===
The Meenas ruled at certain places in Rajasthan until they were overpowered by invading Rajputs. After the end of their rule, the Meenas made forests and hills their shelter and started fighting to get back their kingdom. One such example was the Kingdom of Amber, Who had to face many wars to stop their struggle and later established peace by making treaty with conditionals. From Meenas the Bundi was captured by Rao Dewa (A.D. 1342), Dhundhar by Kachhwaha Rajputs and Chopoli fell to the Muslim rulers. Kota, Jhalawar, Karauli and Jalore were the other areas of earlier Meena influence where they were forced to surrender ultimately.

=== British colonial period ===
The Raj colonial administration came into existence in 1858, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 which caused the government of Britain to decide that leaving colonial administration in the hands of the East India Company was a recipe for further discontent. In an attempt to create an orderly administration through a better understanding of the populace, the Raj authorities instituted various measures of classifying the people of India. One such measure was the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, under the provisions of which Meenas were placed in the first list of the Act in 1872 in Patiala and East Punjab States Union, Rajasthan and Punjab. Another such measure was the Habitual Criminals Act of 1930, under whose provisions the Meenas were placed. The community remained stigmatised for many years, notably by influential officials of the Raj such as Herbert Hope Risley and Denzil Ibbetson, and were sometimes categorised as animists and as a hill tribe similar to the Bhils. The Meenas remained an officially designated criminal tribe until 1952, three years after the Act had been repealed. Mark Brown has examined the impact and issues of the Meena community during British rule and the change in their status from being a higher social group to a criminal tribe.

=== Rebellion ===
In the 1840s, Meenas organized a huge movement in Jaipur under the leadership of Lakshminarayan Jharwal against the British rule, which was a Meena rebellion against the British government.

=== Recent history ===
Kumar Suresh Singh notes that the Meenas have not abandoned their customary laws Meenas have better rights for women in many respects compared to many other Hindu castes.

===Caste reservation===
The Meena fall into the Scheduled Tribe category in the state of Rajasthan and the majority of them are classified as being Hindu, but in Madhya Pradesh Meena are recognised as a Scheduled Tribe only in Sironj Tehsil, Vidisha, while in the other 44 districts of the state they are categorised as Other Backward Classes.

In Rajasthan, the Meena caste members oppose the entry of Gurjars into Scheduled Tribe fold, fearing that their own share of Scheduled Tribe reservation benefits will be eroded.

It is believed by media that the well-off Meena community enjoy a major share of ST reservation at the cost of other tribals.

== Subdivisions ==

The Meenas themselves are also a sub-group of Bhils.

The Meena tribe is divided into several clans and sub-clans (&quot;adakh&quot;s), which are named after their ancestors. Some of the &quot;adakh&quot;s include Ariat, Ahari, Katara, Kalsua, Kharadi, Damore, Ghoghra, Dali, Doma, Nanama, Dadore, Manaut, Charpota, Mahinda, Rana, Damia, Dadia, Parmar, Phargi, Bamna, Khat, Hurat, Hela, Bhagora, and Wagat.

Bhil Meena is another sub-division among the Meenas. As part of a sanskritisation process, some Bhils present themselves as Meenas, who hold a higher socio-economic status compared to the Bhil tribal people.

A sub-group known as &quot;Ujwal Meena&quot; (also &quot;Ujala Meena&quot; or &quot;Parihar Meena&quot;) seek higher status, and claim to be Rajputs, thus distinguishing themselves from the Bhil Meenas. They follow vegetarianism, unlike other Meenas whom they designated as &quot;Mailay Meena&quot;.

Other prevalent social groupings are Zamindar Meena and the Chaukidar Meena. The Zamindar Meena, comparatively well-off, are those who surrendered to powerful Rajput invaders and settled on the lands believe to be granted by the Rajputs. Those who did not surrender to Rajput rule and kept on waging guerrilla warfare are called the Chaukidar Meena.

== Culture ==
There is a custom in the Meenas to perform &quot;Pitra Tarpan&quot; after taking a collective bath on the day of Diwali. They adopt the culture of worshiping trees and plants in marriages, festivals and other ceremonies as per the &quot;Dharadi&quot; tradition. They worship different family deities according to the gotra. They celebrate Meenesh Jayanti on the third day of the Chaitra month&#x27;s Shukla paksha.

=== Art ===
Mandana Paintings are widely practiced by the women of the Meena tribe.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 Census of India, the Meenas have a total population of 5 million. According to a report by Hindustan Times, the population of Meenas in Rajasthan is 7% of the state&#x27;s population. And according to the report of a German news television Deutsche Welle, the Meenas constitute 10% of the population of the state of Rajasthan. Whereas according to a report by BBC Hindi, the population of Meenas is 14% of the state&#x27;s population.

<text>Cirrhitidae, the hawkfishes, are a family of marine ray-finned fishes found in tropical seas and which are associated with coral reefs.

==Taxonomy==
The Cirrhitidae were first recognised as a family by the Scots-born Australian naturalist William Sharp Macleay in 1841. It is one of the five constituent families in the superfamily Cirrhitoidea which is classified in the suborder Percoidei of the order Perciformes. Within the Cirrhitoidea, the Cirrhitidae is probably the most basal family. They have been placed in the order Centrarchiformes by some authorities, as part of the superfamily Cirrhitoidea, however, the fifth edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; does not recognise the Centrarchiformes. The name of the family is taken from that of the genus &quot;Cirrhitus&quot; which is derived from &quot;cirrhus&quot; meaning a &quot;lock of hair&quot; or &quot;a barbel&quot;, thought to be a reference to lower, unbranched rays of the pectoral fins which Bernard Germain de Lacépède termed as &quot;barbillons&quot;, which means &quot;barbels&quot; in his description of the type species of the genus &quot;C. maculatus&quot;, and which he thought to be &quot;false&quot; pectoral fins. Another possibility is that the name refers to cirri extending from the tips of the spines in the dorsal fin spines, although Lacépède did not mention this feature.
===Genera===
The following 12 genera are classified within the Cirrhitidae, containing a total of 33 species:

* &quot;Amblycirrhitus&quot; 
* &quot;Cirrhitichthys&quot; 
* &quot;Cirrhitops&quot; 
* &quot;Cirrhitus&quot; 
* &quot;Cristacirrhitus&quot; 
* &quot;Cyprinocirrhites&quot; 
* &quot;Isocirrhitus&quot; 
* &quot;Itycirrhitus&quot; 
* &quot;Neocirrhites&quot; 
* &quot;Notocirrhitus&quot; 
* &quot;Oxycirrhites&quot; 
* &quot;Paracirrhites&quot; 

==Characteristics==
Cirrhitidae hawkfishes are roughly oblong in shape with a body which has a depth which is 21% to 50% of its standard length. They have a fringe of cirri on the rear edge of the forward nostrils. There are two poorly developed spines, on the gill cover. The outer row of teeth on the jaws are canine-like, the longest normally being located at the front of the upper jaw and the middle of the lower jaw. Inside this row, there is a band of bristle-like teeth, wider in the front. The dorsal fin is continuous, having 10 spines and 11–17 soft rays; it has an incision separating the spiny and soft-rayed parts. The anal fin contains three spines and five to seven, typically six, soft rays. There are 14 pectoral fin rays with the lowest five to seven rays unbranched and normally thickened, with deep notches in the membranes separating these lower rays. There is a single spine in the pelvic fins as well as five soft rays. The scales are cycloid and they lack a swimbladder. The colour and pattern vary between species. The maximum length attained is around , although around is more typical. Most species are quite small and colourfully patterned.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cirrhitidae hawkfishes are found in the tropical western and eastern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific, mainly in the Indo-West Pacific region. They are benthic fishes which are found on coral reefs or rocky substrates, mostly inhabiting shallow water.

== Biology ==
Cirrhitidae fishes use their robust lower pectoral-fin rays to wedge into position where they will be subjected to the forces of currents and waves. They are carnivorous fishes, their main prey being benthic crustaceans. One species, &quot;Cyprinocirrhitus polyactis&quot;, mainly feeds on zooplankton, although it is frequently encountered resting on the substrate. Hawkfish frequently sit and wait on the higher parts of their habitat, diving onto prey items seen underneath them, in a similar manner to some hawk species, hence the name hawkfish.

==Fisheries and utilisation==
Cirrhitidae hawkfishes are mostly too small to be of interest to fisheries. The three largest species are occasionally fished for as food fish. A few of the smaller more colourful species, particularly &quot;Neocirrhites armatus&quot; and &quot;Oxycirrhites typus&quot;, are collected for the aquarium trade.

<doc id="454616" wikidata="Q1702407" url="?curid=454616" title="Johnny Smith">
<text>Johnny Henry Smith II (June 25, 1922 – June 11, 2013) was an American cool jazz and mainstream jazz guitarist. He wrote &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; in 1954. In 1984, Smith was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
During the Great Depression, Smith&#x27;s family moved from Birmingham, Alabama, where Smith was born, through several cities, ending up in Portland, Maine.

Smith taught himself to play guitar in pawnshops, which let him play in exchange for keeping the guitars in tune. At thirteen years of age he was teaching others to play the guitar. One of Smith&#x27;s students bought a new guitar and gave him his old guitar, which became the first guitar Smith owned.

Smith joined Uncle Lem and the Mountain Boys, a local hillbilly band that travelled around Maine, performing at dances, fairs, and similar venues. Smith earned four dollars a night. He dropped out of high school to accommodate this enterprise.

Having become increasingly interested in the jazz bands that he heard on the radio, Smith gradually moved away from country music towards playing jazz. He left The Mountain Boys when he was eighteen years old to join a variety trio called the Airport Boys.

==Military experience==
Having learned to fly from pilots he befriended, Smith enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in the hopes of becoming a military pilot. He was invalidated from the flight programme because of imperfect vision in his left eye. Given a choice between joining the military band and being sent to mechanic&#x27;s school, Smith opted to join the military band. Smith claimed that they gave him a cornet, an Arban&#x27;s instructional book, and two weeks to meet the standard, which included being able to read music. Determined not to go to mechanic&#x27;s school, Smith spent the two weeks practicing the cornet in the latrine, as recommended by the bandleader, and passed the examination.

==Career==
An extremely diverse musician, Johnny Smith was equally at home playing in the Birdland jazz club or sight-reading scores in the orchestral pit of the New York Philharmonic. From Schoenberg to Gershwin to originals, Smith was one of the most versatile guitarists of the 1950s.

As a staff studio guitarist and arranger for NBC from 1946 to 1951, and on a freelance basis thereafter until 1958, Smith played in a variety of settings from solo to full orchestra and had his own trio, The Playboys, with Mort Lindsey and Arlo Hults. His playing is characterized by closed-position chord voicings and rapidly ascending lines (reminiscent of Django Reinhardt, but more diatonic than chromatically-based).

Smith&#x27;s most critically acclaimed recording was of the song &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot;, and featured tenor saxophonist Stan Getz. The single was the second most popular jazz record in &quot;DownBeat&quot;″s readers&#x27; poll for 1952. Initially released as a track on the 10-inch LP &quot;Jazz at NBC&quot; (Roost RLP 410), &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot; was later made the title track of a 1956 12 inch LP. From 1952 and into the 1960s he recorded for the Roost label, on whose releases his reputation mainly rests. Mosaic Records issued the majority of them in an 8-CD set in 2002.

His best-known musical composition is the track &quot;Walk Don&#x27;t Run&quot;, written for a 1954 recording session as a contrafact to &quot;Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise&quot;. Guitarist Chet Atkins covered the track, recording a neo-classical rendition of the song on the electric guitar for his &quot;Hi Fi in Focus&quot; album which preceded the Ventures&#x27; hit by three years. He played his arrangement fingerstyle, including the bass notes A, G, F, and E which later became the basis for the Ventures&#x27; arrangement. The musicians who became The Ventures heard the Atkins version, simplified it, sped it up, and recorded it in 1960. The Ventures&#x27; version went to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 for a week in September 1960.

In 1957, Smith&#x27;s wife died in childbirth, along with his second child. He sent his young daughter to Colorado Springs, Colorado to be cared for temporarily by his mother, and the following year he left his busy performing career in New York City to join his daughter in Colorado. There, Smith ran a musical instruments store, taught music, and raised his daughter while continuing to record albums for the Royal Roost and Verve labels into the 1960s. He told The Colorado Springs Independent in 2001 (as quoted in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary) &quot;In the end, everything came down to the fact that I loved my daughter too much to let my career put her at risk. But there were other factors, too. I loved New York musically, but I hated living there.&quot; Paul Vitello observed that &quot;Smith continued to record, and sometimes performed in Colorado nightclubs, but declined almost all invitations to tour. One exception was for Bing Crosby, whom he accompanied on a tour of England in 1977 that ended shortly before Mr. Crosby&#x27;s death.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
In 1998, Smith was awarded the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal for his contribution to music; the citation singled out &quot;the genesis of &#x27;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&#x27;,&quot; as well as &quot;his manifold accomplishments&quot; and their &quot;profound and pervasive influence on the role of the guitar in contemporary popular culture.&quot; 

Smith died of complications from a fall at his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado, at the age of 90.

In 2018, Tzadik Records released &quot;The Maid With The Flaxen Hair: A Tribute To Johnny Smith&quot; by guitarists Mary Halvorson and Bill Frisell. The album features songs written by, or played by Johnny Smith. Frisell had been a student of Smith in the 1970s.

==Signature guitars==
Guild, Gibson, and Heritage have all made guitar models which were endorsed by Johnny Smith. In each case, the guitar was designed wholly or in part by Smith. Each design was a full-bodied archtop guitar with a top carved from solid spruce and a back and sides made of solid maple. All the on-board electronics for each guitar, from the small pickup in the neck position through the volume knob to the output jack, were mounted on the pickguard.

Smith claimed to have learned about guitar design by observing master luthier John D&#x27;Angelico, who was his friend and guitar supplier when he lived in New York.

===Guild Johnny Smith Award===
In 1955, after discussions with Alfred Dronge, chairman and founder of the Guild Guitar Company, Smith designed a guitar and sent the drawings and specifications to Dronge. The Guild designers modified it (to Smith&#x27;s dissatisfaction), and manufactured the resulting guitar as the Guild Johnny Smith Award.

===Gibson Johnny Smith===
In 1961, Ted McCarty, then president of Gibson, went to meet the retired Smith at his home in Colorado Springs. McCarty spent several days with Smith, during which time Smith designed the guitar he wanted built. The design was accepted by Gibson with a few minor cosmetic changes which were acceptable to Smith. Gibson began production of the resulting Gibson Johnny Smith model that year. Guild continued to produce their Johnny Smith guitar under the model name Guild Artist Award.

===Heritage Johnny Smith===
When Gibson moved its manufacturing facilities from Kalamazoo, Michigan to Nashville, Tennessee, several of their managers and artisans chose to stay behind. Many of these ex-employees formed Heritage Guitars and bought the old Kalamazoo factory from Gibson. Given a choice between Gibson and Heritage building the guitar that bore his name, Smith chose to stay with the old artisans at the old location under new ownership. The Heritage Johnny Smith model was introduced in 1989. Like Guild before them, Gibson continued to manufacture their version of the Johnny Smith design with a new name: the Gibson LeGrand.

===Guild Johnny Smith Award by Benedetto===
William Schultz, chairman of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, of which Guild Guitars was a subsidiary, asked Smith if he would be willing to return his endorsement to the Guild Artist Award. Familiar with Schultz&#x27;s management, and knowing that the construction would be supervised by master luthier Bob Benedetto, Smith agreed. The Guild Johnny Smith Award by Benedetto was available through Guild dealers until early 2006 when Benedetto left Fender. Unlike Guild and Gibson, Heritage Guitars discontinued manufacture of their Smith-designed guitar after Smith withdrew his endorsement.

<doc id="454638" wikidata="Q1619146" url="?curid=454638" title="Himmelsbrief">
<text>A Himmelsbrief, also known as a &quot;heaven&#x27;s letter&quot; (Bilardi, 2009) or &quot;heavenly letter&quot; (Kerr, 2002), is a religious documents said to have been written by God or a divine agent. Their purpose is to protect the bearer or place from all evil and danger; however, there is a price for their protection. Bearers will only be protected so long as they abide by the moral covenants detailed in the letter (Bilardi, 2009).

They are often said to have miraculously &quot;fallen from sky&quot;, claim protection for owners of a copy (encouraging memetic replication) and punishment for disbelievers.

Some authors reserve the name for Christian apocryphal documents, but similar pieces are found in Islam, Hinduism and pre-Christian religions.

Hippolytus of Rome mentions one in &quot;Refutation of All Heresies&quot; (third century), and the earlier full text is a Latin one dated in the 6th century.

While preaching, Jacob, the organizer of the Shepherds&#x27; Crusade (1251), held one which was allegedly given by the Virgin Mary.

==Pennsylvania German==
In the Pennsylvania German community, they are part of Pow-wow tradition and contained Bible verses and other charms and assurances that their owners would be protected from death, injury, and other misfortune. The text of these letters is often written according to a long established formula (Herr, 2002) This is why it is sometimes believed that Himmelsbrief are the original chain letters. Pow-wow practitioners charged handsome sums for these magical letters; the price they commanded depended on the reputation of the practitioner. However, some traditions call for it to be given free of charge. A hand-written letter produced by a respected Hexenmeister or Braucher is regarded as a powerful talisman (Herr, 2002). Himmelsbrief may be written in order to communicate with someone departed, or to request assistance from God in heaven. (Herr, 2002) According to C.R.Bilardi in his book, The Red Church: or the Art of Pennsylvania German Braucherei (2009), two well known examples of these letters are the Koenigsberg Fire Brief of 1714 and the Magdeburg Himmelsbrief of 1783.

<doc id="454640" wikidata="Q38877" url="?curid=454640" title="Hearing dog">
<text>A hearing dog is a specailized assistance dog specifically selected and trained to assist people who are deaf or hard of hearing by alerting their handler to important sounds, such as doorbells, smoke alarms, ringing telephones, or alarm clocks. They may also work outside the home, alerting their handler to sounds such as sirens, forklifts, and a person calling the handler&#x27;s name.

==Training==

Dogs that may become hearing dogs are tested for proper temperament and willingness to work. After passing initial screenings, they are trained in basic obedience and exposed to things they will face in public areas, such as elevators, shopping carts, and different types of people. They are also trained in audio-response training, where they are exposed to different house appliances or other noises, like doorbells. These results are then logged. Only after that period of socializing and audio-response training are they then considered to be fully trained in sound alerting.

Hearing dogs may be trained professionally in as little as three months, though many are trained for at least a year. Generally, training involves getting the dog to recognize a particular sound and then physically alert or lead their handler to the source. They may also be taught to physically alert to and/or lead away from a sound, such as in the case of a fire alarm.

Some deaf or hearing-impaired individuals train their own hearing dogs. However, such dogs might not meet the requirements as stipulated by Assistance Dogs International, and therefore might not have full access to all public spaces and places afforded by such accreditation.

==Accessibility==
In the United States, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 allows hearing dogs, along with guide and service dogs, access to anywhere the general public is permitted. The Fair Housing Act allows hearing dogs as well as other types of assistance animals to visit and live in housing developments that have no pets policies. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity investigates complaints from the public alleging denials of reasonable accommodation requests involving assistance animals. Some state laws also provide access protection or additional guidelines, such as fines or criminal penalties for interfering with or denying access to a hearing dog team.

Hearing dogs often wear a bright orange leash and collar to identify them. Some also wear a cape or jacket, which may or may not be orange. Incidentally, in the United States, a hearing, signal, guide, or any other service dog is not legally required to have or wear any badge, leash, collar, or any other identifying item.

In the United Kingdom, hearing dogs wear distinctive burgundy jackets bearing the logo of the charity (Hearing Dogs for Deaf People) which trains and funds them.

In Australia, hearing dogs are trained through Australian Lions Hearing Dogs. They wear a bright orange leash, collar, and harness to identify them, and carry with them an issued ID. They are legally permitted access to any locations that are open to members of the public, so long as they are with their handler.

In France, these dogs are trained by the Association les Chiens du Silence since 2010. They wear a distinctive blue jacket with the logo of the association, their status (&quot;service dog&quot; or &quot;service dog in training&quot; and the official guide and service dog logo. Their owner also carries an ID card. They are allowed everywhere, with very few exceptions like hospitals (for sanitary reasons), as the law of the country is quite strict on this. 

Some breeds notable for selection as hearing dogs include golden retrievers, poodles, cocker spaniels, labrador retrievers, Australian shepherds and cockapoos.

<text>Ulster University (; Ulster Scots: or ), legally the University of Ulster, is a multi-campus public research university located in Northern Ireland. It is often referred to informally and unofficially as Ulster, or by the abbreviation UU. It is the largest university in Northern Ireland and the second-largest university on the island of Ireland, after the federal National University of Ireland.

Established in 1865 as Magee College, the college took its modern form in 1984 after the merger of the &quot;New University of Ulster&quot; established in 1968, and &quot;Ulster Polytechnic&quot;, incorporating its four Northern Irish campuses under the &quot;University of Ulster&quot; banner. The university incorporated its four campuses in 1984; located in Belfast, Coleraine, Derry (Magee College), and Jordanstown. The university has branch campuses in both London and Birmingham, and an extensive distance learning provision. The university rebranded as Ulster University in October 2014, including a revised visual identity, though its legal name remained unchanged.

The university is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the European University Association, Universities Ireland and Universities UK.

==History==

In 1963, the Government of Northern Ireland appointed a committee to review facilities for university and higher technical education in Northern Ireland, modeled on the committee on higher education in Great Britain chaired by Lionel Robbins which had reported that year. The Northern Ireland committee was chaired by Sir John Lockwood, Master of Birkbeck College, London. The Robbins Report had recommended a substantial expansion of higher education in Great Britain, partly triggered by the Anderson Report of 1960, which increased demand by instigating a student grants scheme. The Lockwood committee was expected to recommend a second university in Northern Ireland, after Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

In Derry, groups led by the University for Derry Committee hoped that Magee University College would become the new university. Founded as a Presbyterian training college in 1865, Magee was associated with the Royal University of Ireland which existed between 1880 and 1908, and then with the University of Dublin and Queen&#x27;s Belfast. However, the Lockwood Report criticised Magee&#x27;s cramped site, complacent culture, and &quot;eccentric&quot; and &quot;barely workable&quot; administration; it found its claim to be based on historical entitlement rather than planning for future. Instead, the report recommended a greenfield university in Coleraine and closing Magee. This was controversial, with many nationalists suggesting the unionist O&#x27;Neill ministry favoured a unionist-majority area rather than nationalist-majority Derry. Disgruntlement fed the Northern Ireland civil rights movement which helped spark the Troubles. The &quot;New University of Ulster&quot; (NUU) enrolled its first students at Coleraine in 1968. Magee was not closed but incorporated in the NUU, which obtained a charter in 1970.

Following a review of higher education in Northern Ireland under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Chilver in 1982, the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) decided to merge NUU with another Lockwood Report foundation, the Ulster Polytechnic in Jordanstown. The NUU charter was surrendered and the merged University of Ulster (dropping &quot;New&quot; from the name) got its charter on 1 October 1984. Later the Belfast School of Art and Design (founded in 1849) became part of the university.

Campus One, the Virtual Campus of the university, was launched on 8 October 2001 which successfully facilitated the provision of undergraduate and postgraduate level courses via distance learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Access &amp; Distributed Learning http://adl.ulster.ac.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The university now simply refers to this as distance learning.

The university formerly had a laboratory named &#x27;The University of Ulster Freshwater Laboratory&#x27; at Traad Point on the shore of Lough Neagh in Ballymaguigan. The Freshwater Laboratory, although not a campus, was a site of the university and consisted of on-campus accommodation, classrooms and testing labs. Courses offered were in agriculture, the wildlife of Lough Neagh, water testing and other aquatic courses. The site is now owned by Magherafelt District Council. By 2010, the area had become popular with the locals for camping, fishing and sailing.

In autumn 2011 Vice-Chancellor Barnett announced a programme of financial restructuring with the aim of reducing the number of staff employed by the university from 3,150 to 3,000. Staff at the university expressed concern about the proposed means and impact of the restructuring, citing &quot;the use of the threat of compulsory redundancy to bully and intimidate staff&quot; and the belief that the university was &quot;abdicating its responsibilities to the wider community that funds it&quot;.

In April 2012, the Ulster University branch of the University and College Union (UCU) declared a formal dispute with university management over its implementation of the restructuring, stating that the recourse to &quot;premature deadlines and unwarranted threats of compulsory redundancy&quot; was &quot;unreasonable as well as contrary to University policy and corporate goals&quot;.

The reasons for cuts are not, however, unique to Ulster University. First of all, there was the Great Recession that began in 2008 and engendered a change in government and a sharp reduction in public spending. Secondly, there were issues pertaining to tuition fees. As a result of political devolution in the United Kingdom (mandated from 1998 onwards), fees differ in the four countries that make up the union. For undergraduate tuition, they are currently in England but only in Northern Ireland. For a while, the low fees in Northern Ireland were hailed as a triumph for devolution and seemed a tool to facilitate access for less advantaged students. Universities in Northern Ireland fared reasonably well financially. However, as Pritchard and Slowey point out, if the government does not make up the shortfall, low fees left Northern Ireland universities at a disadvantage compared to their English counterparts.

In 2015, the UK Government reduced the funding allocation for Higher Education Institutions by 8.2%. Both Northern Ireland universities had to make cuts. Queen&#x27;s University announced immediate job cuts of 236 and student number reductions of ca. 290 (1,010 over the next three years). Ulster also announced its intention of cutting over 200 jobs and 250 student places in 2015–16 (1,200 over the following three years).

On 20 June 2023, the Government of Ireland announced that it was providing approximately million in funding to Ulster University.

==Campuses==
An online distance learning provision offers Ulster University courses globally. The university was among the first Universities to offer degree level programs through its previous &quot;Campus One&quot; program and was a pioneer in the introduction of online degree level courses in Biomedical Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archive of Campus One (http://campusone.ulster.ac.uk/staff/vista.php)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The university was subsequently selected by the European Commission to deliver the world&#x27;s first Higher Educational Programme in Hydrogen Safety Engineering.

===Belfast===
Ulster University&#x27;s Belfast campus is in the city&#x27;s Cathedral Quarter, which is the city&#x27;s artistic and cultural centre. Although traditionally associated with art and home to the university&#x27;s School of Art, originally inaugurated as the Belfast School of Art and Design in 1849, the campus has a range of subjects including architecture, hospitality, event management, photography and digital animation. The award-winning Law Clinic is based at the Belfast campus, offering free legal advice on social security and employment law.

Ulster University has been expanding and developing the Belfast campus since 2009 as part of one of Northern Ireland&#x27;s largest-ever urban developments. The first phase of this development opened in 2015 and completion of the project was due in 2019. In September 2021 the first students were welcomed to the new campus. The fully completed campus began accepting students starting in the 2022/23 academic year. In 2024, 15,000 students and staff are based in the city centre.

===Coleraine===

Ulster University&#x27;s Coleraine campus is on the banks of the River Bann with views to the North Coast and County Donegal hills. Subjects taught at Coleraine include biomedical sciences, environmental science and geography, pharmacy, psychology, the humanities, film and journalism, travel and tourism as well as teacher training.

A major development at Coleraine was the introduction of the degree programme in biomedical sciences in 1980. This subject area grew and was ranked first in the UK in three successive Research Assessment Exercises (1996, 2001 and 2008). It also spawned the development of related subject areas including human nutrition, radiography, clinical science, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, pharmacology and stratified medicine.

In 2002, million was awarded under the Support Programme for University Research (SPUR) to establish the Centre for Molecular Biosciences at Coleraine.

The Coleraine campus now hosts a number of courses which were previously held at the School of Hotel, Leisure and Tourism in Portrush. This Portrush site closed in 2008, with courses relocated to the Coleraine and the newly developed Belfast campuses.

In 2009, the university launched a new Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) course at Coleraine.

In July 2011, in cooperation with Zhejiang University of Media and Communications (ZUMC), &#x27;The Confucius Institute at Ulster University&#x27; (CIUU) was developed. The Confucius Institute is part of a network of 322 institutes in over 50 countries which promote and teach Chinese language and culture and facilitate cultural exchanges aimed at fostering trade links with China.

In spring 2015, a new million teaching block was completed at the Coleraine Campus. Later in 2015, a new Faculty of Arts building was opened following a million investment. It is now home to a digital media archive, updated media facilities, including radio and television studios, and a postgraduate research centre as well as office and administration accommodation.

===Jordanstown===
Ulster University&#x27;s Jordanstown campus, often informally referred to as UUJ, was formerly the site of the Ulster College of Physical Education, one of several Colleges which came together in the formation of the Ulster Polytechnic, and is the largest university campus. The site is located seven miles north of Belfast city centre situated at the foot of the Antrim Hills overlooking Belfast Lough. The buildings are mostly situated around a central mall with on-site stores and services. The campus has a strong profile in business, engineering, construction, social sciences (including law), communication and academic disciplines relating to the science and coaching of sport. Sport plays a significant part in the life of the campus. It is home to the Sports Institute of Northern Ireland, a partnership between the university and Sport Northern Ireland, and most of Northern Ireland&#x27;s elite athletes train in the facilities. The campus is also the only university in Northern Ireland to offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses in various Allied Health Professions, such as Cardiac and Respiratory Clinical Physiology, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Radiography, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Podiatry and Speech and Language Therapy. The campus is also the only campus delivering courses in Biomedical Engineering within Northern Ireland.

===Magee===

The Magee campus in the city of Derry comprises a mixture of historic and new buildings in a Victorian residential area.
It was named after Martha Magee and opened in 1865 as a Presbyterian Christian arts and theological college. Since 1953, it has had no religious affiliation, and was one of the founding campuses of the university in 1968. Ongoing investment in the Magee campus provides teaching, research and support facilities for students and staff. This comprises a student residential village offering en-suite accommodation, a library, the Intelligent Systems Research Centre, the Foyle Arts Building and a Centre for Engineering and Renewable Energy offering a wide range of Engineering courses.

In addition to the university&#x27;s teaching and learning facilities, the campus has on-site residential, catering and sports facilities. Sports facilities include a multi-purpose sports hall, fitness suite and studio as well as a grass and floodlit synthetic 3G pitch with a pavilion and changing facilities.

===Branch campuses===
The university has a partnership with QA Higher Education, which operates two branch campuses in England: London and Birmingham. The London campus is in Holborn, and the Birmingham campus is in the Centre City Tower. The campuses offer courses in business, finance and computing.

=== Qatar ===
In 2019, CUC became an Affiliative College of Ulster University, a partnership which enabled it to offer and deliver Ulster undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes within Qatar. The partnership was officially signed in June 2019, with an official launch in February 2020. The first BSc (Hons) in Business Studies degree was approved to run in 2020 and the first cohort of students, who completed their HND at CUC that year, enrolled in the final year (top-up) of the degree programme in September 2020. The college amended its name to City University College in recognition of its change in status. Under the partnership agreement, the Ulster University, Qatar brand was formed. In October 2020, the Ministry of Higher Education issued a directive that the college should be known as City University College in partnership with Ulster University.

===Research===
The university embarked upon a policy of research selectivity in 1993 funded partially by Northern Ireland Development Funds (NIDevR) administered via the Northern Ireland Higher Education Council. The policy resulted in greatly improved performance by the university in subsequent Research Assessment Exercises (1996, 2001 and 2008; 3 subject areas, biomedical sciences, nursing and Celtic studies were ranked in the top 5 in the UK in the latter exercise) and in improving its publication output, external research funding and knowledge transfer activities. The establishment in 2002–2003 of a number of research institutes in areas of established strength and the receipt of over million through the Support Programme for University Research (SPUR), funded jointly by Atlantic Philanthropies and the Northern Ireland Department for Employment and Learning (DEL), yielded a further significant enhancement in the university&#x27;s research performance.

The Research Excellence Framework 2014 exercise identified the institution as one of the top five universities in the UK for research in law, biomedical sciences, nursing and art and design. Under some metrics, it ranked the university top in Northern Ireland for research into biomedical sciences, law, business and management, architecture and built environment, art and design, social policy, sport, media studies and nursing.

<text>was a pseudonym of Japanese artist , born March 27, 1937 – October 26, 2014 in Yokohama. He used another pseudonym, , for literary works. A member of the influential artist groups Neo-Dada Organizers and Hi-Red Center, Akasegawa went on to maintain a multi-disciplinary practice throughout his career as an individual artist. He has had retrospective exhibitions at the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art, Chiba City Museum, and Oita City Museum. His work is in the permanent collection at Museum of Modern Art in New York. Artist Nam June Paik has described Akasegawa as “one of those unexportable geniuses of Japan.”

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Akasegawa was born in 1937 in Yokohama, and moved to Ashiya, Ōita and Nagoya during his childhood because of his father&#x27;s job. The artist Shūsaku Arakawa was a high school classmate in Nagoya. In the 1950s Akasegawa moved to Tokyo where he attended Musashino Art University in 1955 to study oil painting.

In 1956 and 1957, Akasegawa submitted artworks to the &quot;Nihon Indépendant&quot; exhibition. Being poor at the time, he “could not shut [his] eyes to the poverty around [him] and engage in the pursuit of pure artistic ideals.” Akasegawa also reported his frustration with the socialist realism aesthetic that predominated at the &quot;Nihon Indépendant&quot; during these years, wanting something which “linked real life and painting as closely as possible.”

===Neo-Dada Organizers===

In the late 1950s, Akasegawa began submitting works to the more freewheeling and less ideological Yomiuri Indépendant Exhibition. He has recalled that toward the end of the 1950s a competition emerged among artists showing at the Yomiuri Indépendant to see whose painting could extend furthest from its surface. This, he claimed, freed him from conventional ways of approaching art-making, and may be connected to the development his art underwent in 1960. This year proved a turning point for the artist as it gave rise to both the massive Anpo protests and the founding of the Neo-Dada Organizers. The group was founded officially by Masunobu Yoshimura in April 1960 with their group show at Ginza Gallery in Tokyo. The members included, along with Akasegawa, artists acquainted through the Yomiuri Indépendant such as Ushio Shinohara, Shō Kazakura, Kinpei Masuzawa, and Shūsaku Arakawa. Other artist frequently involved though not officially a part of the group included Tetsumi Kudō, Tomio Miki, and Natsuyuki Nakanishi, with whom Akasegawa would later go on to form Hi-Red Center.

The Neo-Dada Organizers group engaged in a series of bizarre &quot;events&quot; and &quot;happenings&quot; that blended visual and performance art, which the art critic Yoshiaki Tōno labeled “Anti-Art” (&quot;Han-geijutsu&quot;) and Ichirō Hariu, another critic, deemed “savagely meaningless.” As art historian Reiko Tomii has concisely put it, “the goal of Anti-Art was to question and dismantle Art (&quot;geijutsu&quot;) as a cultural and metaphysical construct of modern times.” The activities of the Neo-Dada Organizers can be said to conform with what Akasegawa has since termed “creative destruction” in which systematic iconoclasm toward conventions and rules were meant to open possibilities for new forms of art. Such include &quot;Anpo Commemoration Event&quot; (Anpo ki’nen ebento) which they staged on June 18, 1960, just three days after the death of Michiko Kanba at the storming of the National Diet Building during an Anpo protest. In this group performance, which included prosthetic male genitalia, a fake wound reminiscent of seppuku rituals, and other disturbing imagery, Akasegawa appeared in a head-wrap and a “grotesque, monster-like costume and took massive gulps directly from a bottle of strong &quot;shōchū&quot; alcohol while dancing around bizarrely and making awful noises.” &quot;Anpo Commemoration Event&quot; demonstrated the overlapping concerns of the Anpo protests and the Neo-Dada Organizers, both manifestations of social discontent with the existing institutions of Japan in 1960.

Around this time Akasegawa also made his &quot;Sheets of Vagina&quot; (1961/1994). For this piece Akasegawa assembled tire inner tubes, sliced open, folded and sewn together. The exposed, red inside of the inner tube can be said to evoke the image of human biology, in this case a female body. Centered near the top of the composition he placed a hub cab, producing a strange, semi-organic and semi-machinic assemblage. Through the use of discarded industrially manufactured materials, Akasegawa pointed to both the rapid development of postwar Japanese society to which he was responding as well as a “version of the mechanistic woman and the erotic machine, explored by Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp earlier in the century.” This latter theme can also be found in the photo-montage works of Akasegawa from around the same time. Another work from Akasegawa&#x27;s so-called tire-works is &quot;Present Arrived Too Early&quot; (Hayaku tsukisugita purezento), a work whose relation to Man Ray&#x27;s &quot;Gift&quot; (1921) Kuroda Raiji has cited to claim that “no matter how unusual his materials and themes may be, Akasegawa faithfully observed the orthodox constructs of ‘painting’ and ‘making.’”

===Hi-Red Center===

In 1963, Akasegawa formed the art collective Hi-Red Center with Jirō Takamatsu and Natsuyuki Nakanishi. The group&#x27;s name was formed from the first kanji characters of the three artists&#x27; surnames: &quot;high&quot; (the &quot;Taka&quot; in Takamatsu), &quot;red&quot; (the &quot;Aka&quot; in Akasegawa), and &quot;center&quot; (the &quot;Naka&quot; in Nakanishi). Hi-Red Center&#x27;s founding may be traced to a symposium on the relationship between art and political action that occurred November 1962 titled &quot;Signs of Discourse on Direct Action&quot;, in which all three members participated. The three artists of Hi-Red Center were all featured in &quot;Room in Alibi&quot; (Fuzai no Heya, July 1963), the Yusuke Nakahara-curated inaugural exhibition of Naiqua Gallery in Tokyo, where they all exhibited works as individual artists. For this exhibition, Akasegawa presented a chair, electric fan, radio and carpet, items symbolic of Japan&#x27;s growth as a modern, capitalist society, all wrapped in brown paper. This wrapping gesture was intended to provoke new forms of engagement with everyday objects, a curious way of “seeing” objects anew by obscuring them. The piece was also titled &quot;Room in Alibi&quot; (1963/1995).

All three artists had begun as painters but had turned to methods of “direct action” through Hi-Red Center, a term taken from prewar socialist agitators. With “direct action,” the artists meant to raise to consciousness the absurdities and contradictions of Japanese society. They achieved this through a variety of &quot;events,&quot; &quot;plans,&quot; and &quot;happenings&quot; such as &quot;Dropping Event&quot; (October 10, 1964), in which they heaved various objects front he roof of Ikenobo Kaikan hall. After dropping the objects they collected and packed them all into a suitcase, placing it in a public locker and sending the key to the locker to someone chosen at random from a phone book. For &quot;Shelter Plan&quot; (1964), they booked a room at the Imperial Hotel and invited guests to have themselves custom-fitted for a personal nuclear fallout shelter. Participants included Yoko Ono and Nam June Paik, and were photographed from six sides to create a quasi-medical document ostensibly meant for the outfitting of personal fallout shelters. &quot;The Movement for the Promotion for a Clean and Organized Metropolitan Area&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;Cleaning Event&quot;) occurred October 16, 1964, in which they dressed in goggles and lab coats, roped off small areas of public sidewalk and meticulously cleaned them to mock the efforts to beautify the streets in anticipation of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The group would dissolve only a year and a half after its inception, with Akasegawa recounting cryptically that “after &quot;Cleaning Event&quot; there was simply nothing left to do.”

Another notable event of Hi-Red Center&#x27;s was the June 1964 &quot;Great Panorama Exhibition&quot; held at Naiqua Gallery. While this project took the more conventional form of an art exhibition than some of their other events, the exhibition itself blurred the boundaries between art and everyday life in ways that engaged the artists’ interest in “direct action.” For five days the exhibition was closed, with two pieces of wood nailed over the gallery door in an X-shaped barricade. The word “Closed” was written on a piece of paper and fastened to one of the pieces of wood. The exhibition remained this way until the final day on which an “opening” event was held. Members of the Tokyo art community as well as others, including Jasper Johns, attended this opening event in which the gallery was revealed to be full of empty cans. Among them were Akasegawa&#x27;s &quot;Canned Universe&quot; (1964/1994) pieces, in which Akasegawa removed the labels of cans and placed them in the can&#x27;s inner wall as to invert the can&#x27;s “contents” to become the entire universe in a simple but clever gesture. Of these works, some cans were soldered shut and at other times their lids were left ajar, revealing the label lining the inner wall. For Akasegawa these canned universe pieces were necessarily part of a set. Because the cans “enclosed” the universe, including his other inverted cans within that universe, he created a paradoxical situation in which the cans “contained” each other simultaneously.

In March 1965, with the help of Fluxus member Shigeko Kubota, Hi-Red Center&#x27;s activities were documented on a map of Tokyo and published through Fluxus newspaper no. 5. This &quot;Bundle of Events&quot; was sold as a crumpled bundle of paper tied together by rope.

=== &quot;Model One Thousand-Yen Note Incident&quot; ===

In May 1963, Akasegawa sent out invitations to &quot;The Fifth Mixer Plan&quot;, Hi-Red Center&#x27;s first gallery exhibition at Dai-Ichi Gallery in Tokyo. The announcement was delivered to several close friends in a cash envelope sent through the postal service. The announcement itself was a 1,000-yen note reproduced in monochromatic colors on the front with relevant information regarding the exhibit on the back. Thereafter, he used printed sheets of the copied note as wrapping paper to wrap a variety of everyday objects for a series of artworks called &quot;Packages.&quot;

Akasegawa&#x27;s note was first discovered by the Japanese authorities during a raid on the houses of members of the radical leftist group Hanzaisha Domei (League of Criminals). The police were investigating an allegedly pornographic photograph in a book titled &quot;Akai Fusen Aruiwa Mesuokami No Yoru&quot; (Red Balloon, or Night of the She-Wolf). During the raid the police found Akasegawa&#x27;s printed note, which was also featured in the book. As the book was only printed to be circulated among friends, the evidence should not have been prosecuted. However, because Hanzaisha Domei was monitored by the authorities as “ideologically perverse” (shisoteki henshitsu-sha), members of the group were arrested and the news was publicized in major newspapers and weekly magazines. Hi-Red Center was also labeled as ideologically perverse by Japanese authorities. Asahi newspaper reported Akasegawa&#x27;s case as a headlining story on January 26, 1964, connecting it to the recent and high-profile “Chi-37” case of banknote counterfeiting discovered in circulation in the Japanese economy.

Akasegawa was indicted for creating imitations of banknotes, in violation of the 1895 Law to Regulate the Imitation of Currency and Bond Certificates. He was charged with the crime of &quot;copying&quot; (&quot;mozō&quot;), i.e. the simulation of currency, which was a lesser charge than actual counterfeiting, but nonetheless quite serious. The language of the law was vague, prohibiting any manufacture or sale of objects with an exterior front that might “be confused for currency or securities.” Akasegawa countered that rather than &quot;copying&quot; (&quot;mozō&quot;), he was merely &quot;modeling&quot; (&quot;mokei&quot;) the notes, just as one would create a model airplane. He developed this theory of “modeling” in response to the concept of counterfeiting as defined by Japanese law immediately after he gave depositions to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police in January 1964.

In August 1966, Akasegawa&#x27;s initial trial and numerous appeals began; the entire process would last until 1970. Akasegawa treated the entire incident as a work of performance art or a happening, and spoke of it as he would speak of his physical artworks, dubbing it the &quot;Model Thousand-Yen Note Incident&quot;. Resulting from the trial was also the so-called &quot;Exhibition Event at the Courtroom&quot;, which occurred August 1966. Here, the evidence exhibited during the thirty five minute review turned the courtroom into a kind of gallery space. This happening of sorts was documented by a court photographer. During the trial, numerous well-known artists who were Akasegawa&#x27;s friends and associates testified on his behalf. Together, they appropriated the courtroom as a space for artistic production and debate on the meaning of art. Akasegawa recorded his thoughts and experiences as the trials were proceeding in a series of essays published in 1970 in the collection titled &quot;Obuje o motta musansha&quot; (The Proletarian Carrying an &quot;Objet&quot;).

The case also produced the 1,000-Yen Note Incident Discussion Group, where intellectuals and artists could discuss the questions raised by the trial and the strategy of Akasegawa&#x27;s defense. The case hinged on two difficult questions: first, whether Akasegawa&#x27;s model thousand-yen note constituted &quot;art,&quot; and second, whether that art was protected free expression and therefore not a crime. The argument taken up by Akasegawa&#x27;s defense, that the reproduction of the banknote constituted an act of art, ironically contradicted his prior artistic activities that had actively tried to escape the confines of art through the concept of public invisibility he called “namelessless” (&quot;mumeisei&quot;). Ultimately, the court decided that the note was in fact art, but that producing that art also constituted a criminal act. In June 1967, Akasegawa was found guilty and given a lenient three-month suspended sentence. He appealed twice but exhausted his final appeal when the Supreme Court of Japan ruled against him in 1970.

Following the guilty verdict of the Model 1,000-Yen Note Incident, Akasegawa&#x27;s first project was to produce 0 yen notes which he exchanged for 300 yen. This &quot;Greater Japan Zero-Yen Note&quot; (1967) project was a playful, law-abiding response on the charges of which he had just been convicted. The gesture, however, contained a radical idea in that the exchange of 0 yen notes for his price of 300 yen would, when brought to its logical conclusion, cause the economy to malfunction.

===Photographic Activity and Thomassons===
In 1970 Akasegawa was appointed to teach at the Bigakkō art school. Here with his students he began to explore what he referred to as &quot;chōgeijutsu&quot; (&quot;hyperart&quot;) and what would later lead to the coining of &quot;Thomassons.&quot; These activities arose from jokingly likening odd urban phenomena to conceptual art gestures, such as stairs leading to an entrance that had since been removed. The term &quot;Thomasson&quot; was a jocular reference to the baseball player Gary Thomasson, who was recruited to the Tokyo Giants on an exorbitant salary but was rarely able to hit the ball. These Thomassons were often categorized by Akasegawa, such as “Atomic Thomassons” to describe the ghostly traces of things removed from their contexts, or “Sada Abe Thomassons” ascribed to truncated telephone poles and named after an infamous Japanese woman who had severed her lover&#x27;s genitalia with a kitchen knife. The term “Thomasson” was even used by science fiction writer William Gibson to describe a bridge that had become taken over by squatters, turning it into a “junk sculpture.” The classes Akasegawa taught at Bigakkō produced the Thomasson Observation Center, whose activity was serially published in Super Photo Magazine (Shashin Jidai). Here Akasegawa also invited readers to submit their own Thomassons, promising a reward of a zero-yen note.

That Thomassons were rooted in a lighthearted game of discovering “art” within the everyday inverted the artistic development of the readymade. Akasegawa commented upon in his “The Objet after Stalin,” writing that although “we usually think of a urinal as something whose sole mission is to receive our urine and conduct it to the sewage,” Marcel Duchamp’s gesture of bringing a urinal into an art context “stripped us from our intrinsic power as managers and rulers of the urinal, thus setting it free.” By this liberation of the urinal, Duchamp “consequently fills up with freedom also his own head. The title objet was born under this condition of reciprocal liberation.” Through this reciprocal liberation, art and ordinary life permeate each other through their conventional divide.

In January 1986, Akasegawa and his collaborators, Terunobu Fujimori, Shinbo Minami, Tetsuo Matsuda, Tsutomu Ichiki, and Joni Hayashi, met with Geijutsu Shincho editor Takeshita Tachibana to announce the formation of a new group: Rojō Kansatsu Gakkai (Street Observation Society), abbreviated as Rojō. The group combined its members’ individual affinities with “modernology,” a term coined by Wajiro Kon and Kenkichi Yoshida in their &quot;Kogengaku&quot; (Modernology). This placed Rojō in a “Japanese lineage of amateur investigators of material culture and everyday life,” such as Kon&#x27;s documentation of the “behaviors and living environments of a rapidly modernising Japanese society.” As such, Rojō broadened the scope of inquiry to incorporate Akasegawa&#x27;s interest in Thomassons into the broader context of modern Japanese life.

Akasegawa was fond of old cameras, especially Leicas, and from 1992 to around 2009, he joined Yutaka Takanashi and Yūtokutaishi Akiyama in the photographers&#x27; group Raika Dōmei, which held numerous exhibitions.

===Fiction, Manga, and Other Pursuits===

As &quot;Katsuhiko Otsuji,&quot; he received the Akutagawa Prize in 1981 for his short story, &quot;Chichi ga kieta&quot; (Father Disappeared). In addition to fiction, Akasegawa is known for his essays and manga written with characteristic humor and style. He is perhaps best known by the general public for his 1998 book &quot;Rōjin Ryoku&quot; (Geriatric Power), which was a bestseller in Japan. In this book he argues that the physical and mental decline that accompanies old age is in fact proof of increased strength.

Akasegawa also produced manga, most notably &quot;The Sakura Illustrated&quot; (Sakura Gaho) in the 70s. This manga was first serialized in the weekly &quot;Asahi Journal&quot; from August 1970 to March 1971.

<text>The Spring-Summer 2004 [[Christian Dior S.A.|Christian Dior]] [[haute couture]] collection was designed by John Galliano and presented on January 19, 2004 in Paris. It was inspired by Galliano&#x27;s then recent travels to Egypt. (Ethnic influences are often prominent in Galliano&#x27;s work.) 
The collection was one of Galliano&#x27;s most celebrated collections for Dior.

The collection included leopard-print fur stoles with collars that &quot;soar like obelisks&quot;, billowing gowns of shadow-dyed organza, with hems twisted and folded into lotus flower shapes, and pyramid-shaped gowns made of dozens of golden mirrors, and printed with hieroglyphics, or the glamorous mummies paraded in bandages of black silk tulle flashing with rainbow sequins. Many wore Nefertiti-like crowns, or long Egyptian &quot;goatees&quot;. The models wore breast-plates of turquoise, coral, silver and gold, and earrings the size of &quot;eagles&#x27; eggs&quot;. All models were outfitted in corsets. The models wore carved and polished wood masks, of Tutenkhamun, or gods like Horus, a falcon, Bast, a cat, or Anubis, a jackal. The masks were made by London milliner Stephen Jones.

Models in the show included Britain&#x27;s Erin O&#x27;Connor, who opened the collection, Brazil&#x27;s Raquel Zimmermann and Caroline Trentini, Sudan-born Alek Wek, the Dutch Yfke Sturm and the Czech Karolína Kurková, who closed the collection.

<doc id="454655" wikidata="Q1133316" url="?curid=454655" title="The Wedding Singer">
<text>The Wedding Singer is a 1998 American romantic comedy film directed by Frank Coraci, written by Tim Herlihy, and produced by Robert Simonds and Jack Giarraputo. The film stars Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, and Christine Taylor, and tells the story of a wedding singer in 1985 who falls in love with a waitress. The film was released on February 13, 1998. Produced on a budget of million, it grossed $123million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics. It is often ranked as one of Sandler&#x27;s best comedies.

The film was later adapted into a stage musical of the same name, debuting on Broadway in April 2006 and closing on New Year&#x27;s Eve of that same year. Jon Lovitz would reprise his role as Jimmie Moore in the episode of the same name of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, set during the events of &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, with Sandler, Barrymore and Billy Idol appearing through the use of archival footage. The film marks the first collaboration between Sandler and Barrymore, and is followed by &quot;50 First Dates&quot; and &quot;Blended&quot; (the latter also directed by Coraci).

==Plot==
Robbie Hart is a wedding singer in Ridgefield, New Jersey in 1985, whose own wedding to his fiancée Linda is approaching. He meets and befriends Julia Sullivan, a new waitress at the reception hall where he works, and promises to sing at her wedding, though her fiancé, businessman and bond investor Glenn Gulia, has yet to set a date.

On Robbie&#x27;s wedding day, his sister Kate informs him as he waits at the altar that Linda has changed her mind about the wedding, leaving him humiliated and emotionally devastated. Later that day, Linda visits Robbie and reveals that she fell in love with him for his ambitions of being a rock star and hates the idea of being married to a wedding singer.

Robbie sinks into depression, causing his friends and family to be concerned. His best friend Sammy convinces him to return to work, but he gives a depressed performance that is panned, and decides to give up wedding gigs and reneges on his promise to sing for Julia when Glenn finally sets a date.

However, Julia convinces him to help her with the planning and their friendship blossoms. Holly tells Julia she thinks that Robbie is good looking and asks her for permission to date Robbie. During a double date with Julia, Glenn, and Julia&#x27;s cousin Holly, Robbie learns from Glenn that he cheats on Julia frequently and plans to continue after they are married.

Julia and Robbie are increasingly confused by their deepening feelings for each other. When Holly tells Robbie that Julia is marrying Glenn for his security he unsuccessfully pursues a job at a bank. Julia is dismayed at his materialism, and when he accuses her of the same, she becomes angry with him. Depressed, he decides to follow Sammy&#x27;s example of only having shallow relationships with women. In response to which Sammy confides that he is unhappy, and encourages Robbie to tell Julia how he feels about her. Sammy says that he used to idolize men like the Fonz. He then confides that he doesn&#x27;t want to be a 50 year old man hitting on chicks. 

Meanwhile, Julia confides in her mother that she has fallen out of love with Glenn and has developed feelings for Robbie. Julia bursts into tears thinking about becoming &quot;Mrs. Julia Gulia&quot;. Robbie arrives to declare his feelings, and sees her through her bedroom window in her wedding dress. Robbie doesn&#x27;t know she is happily looking in the mirror pretending she has just married Robbie. Robbie assumes she is thinking of Glenn.

Heartbroken, Robbie leaves to get drunk and finds Glenn in the midst of his pre-wedding bachelor party, arm in arm with another woman. After a heated exchange, Glenn punches Robbie and mocks him. Robbie stumbles home to find Linda waiting for him wanting to reconcile, and passes out.

The following morning, Linda answers the door and introduces herself as his fiancée to a crestfallen Julia. She runs to Glenn, who is sleeping off the events of the previous night, and tells him she wants to be married immediately. He half-heartedly offers to take her to Las Vegas.

Robbie awakens and, after shaking off his hangover from the previous night, rejects Linda&#x27;s reconciliation, having realized how shallow she is during his time with Julia, and kicks her out. At the 50th wedding anniversary party of his neighbor Rosie, to whom he has been giving singing lessons, he realizes he wants to grow old with Julia and, with Rosie&#x27;s encouragement, he decides to pursue her. Just then, Holly arrives and informs him of Julia&#x27;s encounter with Linda, so Robbie rushes to the airport and gets a first class ticket to Las Vegas.

After telling his story to his empathetic fellow passengers, which include Billy Idol, Robbie learns that Glenn and Julia are on the same flight. With the help of Billy and the flight crew, over the loudspeaker, he sings a song he has written called &quot;Grow Old With You&quot;, dedicated to Julia. As Robbie enters the main cabin singing, Glenn tries to assault him only to be thwarted and shoved into a lavatory by the flight attendants with assistance from Billy and a large fan.

Robbie and Julia admit their love for each other, and share a kiss. Billy, impressed by Robbie&#x27;s song, offers to tell his record company executives about him. Later, Robbie and Julia are married, and a band led by Robbie&#x27;s friend David performs at their wedding.

== Production ==
&quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; is a 1980s nostalgia film. Adam Sandler had an idea for a comedy about a wedding singer who gets left at the altar, and suggested it to Tim Herlihy. Inspired by the radio show &quot;Lost in the &#x27;80s&quot; Herlihy decided to set the film in that decade. Herlihy had not set out to do anything different and thought the script was similar to his previous collaborations with Sandler. The changes came naturally, and he attributed the differences to his recently having gotten married, as well as the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore. Herlihy was aware that Sandler&#x27;s previous films had lacked a female perspective, and emphasized the importance of Barrymore. He explained that she was so great in her scenes that test audiences did not complain about Sandler not being in every scene as they had done for his previous films, and as a result more of her scenes survived and were included in the final film. Carrie Fisher, a frequent script doctor, was brought on to make the female part more balanced. Judd Apatow and Sandler also performed uncredited rewrites of the script.

Director Frank Coraci was friends with Sandler since they went to college at NYU and could hardly believe that he and his friends had the opportunity to make films together. Coraci had also gotten over his own experiences of romantic heartbreak a few years earlier and was able to look back on it differently and instead allow it to be funny. Coraci was a fan of director John Hughes and mentioned his films as an important influence.

Barrymore approached Sandler about working together on a film, saying they were &quot;cinematic soulmates&quot; before they had even worked together. Barrymore had a great relationship with Coraci, and praised him for balancing the broad comedy with the important moments of emotion and intimacy. Sandler would often make Barrymore laugh out of context, so that even after a long day, her laughs on camera would be real. In addition, she would not read or hear the songs until the first shoot so that her reactions would be more spontaneous.

Principal photography took place in California from February 3 to March 25, 1997.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===

The film had a budget of $18million and made $123.3 million worldwide in ticket sales. It opened in second in the US with $18.8 million, behind holdover &quot;Titanic&quot;.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;It&#x27;s decidedly uneven -- and surprisingly sappy for an early Adam Sandler comedy -- but &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; is also sweet, funny, and beguiling.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Director Frank Coraci and scripter Tim Herlihy work in concert to maintain a quality of farce rooted in human comedy.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film a negative review and wrote: &quot;The screenplay reads like a collaboration between Jekyll and Hyde.&quot;
Boy George responded to the film, saying that when he saw Alexis Arquette doing an impersonation of him and singing &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot;, he thought it was hilarious.

The film has frequently been ranked as one of Sandler&#x27;s best comedies.

== Musical adaptation ==

In 2006, a musical adaption of the same name was released on Broadway starring Stephen Lynch as Robbie and Laura Benanti as Julia. The show has had two national tours in 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 respectively. It was nominated for five Tony Awards and eight Drama Desk Awards and received generally good reviews. In this show, the airplane scene with Billy Idol was replaced with a scene in Las Vegas where Robbie meets a Billy Idol impersonator, and they and a group of other impersonators including Ronald Reagan, Cyndi Lauper and Imelda Marcos come to convince Julia to give up Glenn. In addition, Robbie&#x27;s neighbor Rosie is changed to be his grandma with whom he lives and who asks him to write a song out of a poem she wrote for the 50th anniversary party. Also Robbie&#x27;s friend, Sammy, was changed from being a limousine driver to being a part of Robbie&#x27;s band. The show only ran on Broadway for 284 performances but has become a popular show among community theaters and high schools.

<doc id="454662" wikidata="Q354306" url="?curid=454662" title="Stanisław Dziwisz">
<text>Stanisław Jan Dziwisz (; born 27 April 1939) is a Polish prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Metropolitan Archbishop of Kraków from 2005 until 2016. He was created a cardinal in 2006. He was a long-time and influential aide to Pope John Paul II, a friend of Pope Benedict XVI, and an ardent supporter of John Paul II&#x27;s beatification.

==Early life, ordination, and priesthood==
Stanisław Jan Dziwisz was born in the village of Raba Wyżna to Stanisław Dziwisz, a railroad worker, and his wife, Zofia Bielarczyk. The fifth of seven children, he has four brothers and two sisters. During World War II, the family hid a Jewish man in their house. When the younger Stanisław was only nine, his father died after being struck by a train while crossing the railroad tracks. He attended the classical Secondary School (Liceum) in Nowy Targ, passing the exam of maturity in 1957.

Dziwisz then entered the Major Seminary of Kraków, where he completed his studies in philosophy and theology. On 23 June 1963, he was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Kraków by its auxiliary bishop, Bishop Karol Wojtyła. His first assignment was as a curate at a parish in Maków Podhalański, where he served for two years. He then continued his studies at the Faculty of Theology of Kraków, specializing in liturgy and earning a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1967. In October 1966, he was appointed by Archbishop Wojtyła, who had been elevated to Archbishop of Kraków, to serve as his personal secretary. Dziwisz remained in this position until Wojtyła&#x27;s death in 2005.

In addition to his duties as personal secretary, Dziwisz served as professor of liturgy at the Superior Catechetical Institute in Kraków, editor of the official newspaper of the archdiocesan curia, member and secretary of the Archdiocesan Liturgical Commission, and a member of the Presbyteral Council. He also participated in the work of the Committee for the Holy Year (1974–1975) and of the Pastoral Synod of Kraków (1972–1978).

Dziwisz accompanied Wojtyła to the papal conclave of August 1978, which elected Pope John Paul I. Following the death of John Paul I thirty-three days later, he and Wojtyła returned for the next conclave, which elected Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II. Dziwisz was appointed his principal private secretary and served in that capacity throughout John Paul&#x27;s 27-year pontificate.

In 1981 he earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree from the Faculty of Theology of Kraków, with a thesis entitled &quot;The Cult of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop of Kraków, until the Council of Trent&quot;.

Dziwisz was appointed titular bishop of San Leone and joint head of the Prefecture of the Papal Household on 7 February 1998. He was consecrated a bishop on 19 March of that year by Pope John Paul II with co-consecrators Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Cardinal Sodano and Cardinal-Archbishop of Kraków Franciszek Cardinal Macharski. John Paul elevated Dziwisz to the rank of archbishop on 29 September 2003.

In 2004, Dziwisz appeared to be the source of a quote from John Paul endorsing the film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, which required clarification from Vatican officials because the pope never makes such endorsements.

==Death of John Paul II==

As the Vatican denied the pope&#x27;s health was getting worse, the Roman newspaper &quot;Il Messaggero&quot; reported that Dziwisz had told a priest, &quot;Pray for the pope, because he&#x27;s getting worse.&quot; On 31 March 2005 Dziwisz administered the Anointing of the Sick to him. Before the death of John Paul II, Dziwisz was reported to have helped him write a message to his staff not to grieve, that he (John Paul) was happy and that they should be too. In 2013, Dziwisz said that Pope John Paul II had not resigned because of his failing health because he believed &quot;you cannot come down from the cross&quot;.

When John Paul died on 2 April 2005, Dziwisz was at his bedside. According to rules created by John Paul, Dziwisz packed his belongings and vacated the papal apartments before they were sealed by the Camerlengo. During the Requiem Mass for John Paul on 8 April, Dziwisz had the honour of placing a white silk veil over the face of the Pope before the body was lowered into three separate caskets. It was his last act of service as papal secretary. He was one of the few people Pope John Paul mentioned in his will, writing: &quot;and I thank him for his help and collaboration, so understanding for so many years&quot;.

==Metropolitan Archbishop of Krakow and cardinal==
On 3 June 2005 Benedict XVI appointed Dziwisz to succeed Cardinal Macharski as Metropolitan Archbishop of Kraków.

At the consistory of 24 March 2006 Dziwisz was raised to the rank of cardinal, becoming Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria del Popolo. Dziwisz had earlier been mentioned as the possible cardinal created &quot;in pectore&quot; by John Paul II in 2003, but the identity of that person remained unknown at John Paul&#x27;s death.

On 6 May 2006 Pope Benedict named Dziwisz to be a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education and the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.

On 26 May 2010, Dziwisz was awarded the Cardinal Bea Interfaith Award of the Anti-Defamation League. Abraham Foxman, its president, said: &quot;Cardinal Dziwisz is a valued friend to the Jewish people and someone I know I can trust and turn to in moments of tension or controversy.&quot; Dziwisz replied:
In 2012 Dziwisz, as part of a broader trip, visited parishes with a significant Polish presence in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey, in the United States.

Dziwisz participated in the papal conclave in March 2013 that elected Pope Francis.

On 8 December 2016, Pope Francis accepted Dziwisz&#x27; resignation as Archbishop of Kraków and named Marek Jędraszewski, Archbishop of Łódź, to succeed him. On 27 April 2019 Dziwisz reached 80 years of age and became ineligible to vote in a papal conclave.

==Maciel and Groër involvement==
Dziwisz supported Roman Catholic priest Marcial Maciel Degollado of Mexico, the founder of the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi movement. Author Jason Berry wrote that Maciel spent years cultivating Vatican support by funneling money to the Vatican. Under Maciel, the Legion of Christ steered streams of money through Dziwisz to the pope and the Vatican, sums that were designated for use in relation to the pope&#x27;s private Masses in the Apostolic Palace. Late in Maciel&#x27;s life, he was revealed to have abused boys and fathered up to six children, two of whom he allegedly abused, with at least two women.

Dziwisz was instrumental in blocking an investigation into allegations of child abuse against the late Benedictine Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër, archbishop of Vienna. Groer, who died in 2003, headed the Vienna archdiocese and presided over the influential Austrian episcopal conference. Groer, who always denied wrongdoing, was praised by Pope John Paul II as a faithful servant. The Roman Catholic bishops of Austria, however, were of a different opinion. On the occasion of their &quot;ad limina&quot; visit to Rome in 1998, the Austrian bishops informed the Pope that they, as a college of bishops, had reached moral certainty that the allegations against Cardinal Groer had a basis in truth.

==Post-retirement==
In November 2020, Polish news channel TVN24 aired a documentary alleging that while Dziwisz was archbishop he failed to investigate allegations of sex abuse. A Vatican investigation by Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco cleared Dziwisz of wrongdoing in 2022.

<doc id="454673" wikidata="Q2645980" url="?curid=454673" title="Nine lemma">
<text>In mathematics, the nine lemma (or 3×3 lemma) is a statement about commutative diagrams and exact sequences valid in the category of groups and any abelian category. It states: if the diagram to the right is a commutative diagram and all columns as well as the two bottom rows are exact, then the top row is exact as well. Likewise, if all columns as well as the two top rows are exact, then the bottom row is exact as well. Similarly, because the diagram is symmetric about its diagonal, rows and columns may be interchanged in the above as well. 

The nine lemma can be proved by direct diagram chasing, or by applying the snake lemma (to the two bottom rows in the first case, and to the two top rows in the second case).

Linderholm (p. 201) offers a satirical view of the nine lemma:
Draw a noughts-and-crosses board... Do not fill it in with noughts and crosses... Instead, use curved arrows... Wave your hands about in complicated patterns over this board. Make some noughts, but not in the squares; put them at both ends of the horizontal and vertical lines. Make faces. You have now proved:

(a) the Nine Lemma&lt;br&gt;
(b) the Sixteen Lemma&lt;br&gt;
(c) the Twenty-five Lemma...
There are two variants of nine lemma: sharp nine lemma and symmetric nine lemma (see Lemmas 3.3, 3.4 in Chapter XII of ).

<doc id="454678" wikidata="Q318912" url="?curid=454678" title="Eric the Victorious">
<text>Eric the Victorious (Old Norse: &quot;Eiríkr inn sigrsæli&quot;, Modern Swedish: &quot;Erik Segersäll&quot;; c. 945 – c. 995) was a Swedish monarch as of around 970. Although there were earlier Swedish kings, he is the first Swedish king in a consecutive regnal succession, who is attested in sources independent of each other, and consequently Sweden&#x27;s list of rulers usually begins with him. His son Olof Skötkonung, however, is considered the first ruler documented to definitely have been accepted both by the original Swedes around Lake Mälaren and by the Geats around Lake Vättern. Adam of Bremen reports a king named Emund Eriksson before Eric, but it is not known whether he was Eric&#x27;s father. The Norse sagas&#x27; accounts of a Björn Eriksson are considered unreliable. 

Some sources have referred to Eric the Victorious as either King &quot;Eric V&quot; or &quot;Eric VI&quot;, modern inventions by counting backwards from Eric XIV (1560–1568), who adopted his numeral according to a 16th-century work on the history of Sweden, &quot;Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sueonumque regibus&quot;. Whether or not there were any Swedish monarchs named Eric before Eric the Victorious is disputed, with some historians claiming that there were several earlier Erics, and others questioning the reliability of the primary sources used and the existence of these earlier monarchs. The list of monarchs after him is also complicated and sketchy in some early periods, which makes the assignment of any numeral problematic (see Eric and Eric and Erik Årsäll) whether counting backward or forward.

==Eric&#x27;s kingdom==
His original territory was in Uppland and neighbouring provinces. He acquired the epithet of &quot;Segersäll&quot; – &quot;Victorious&quot; or literally &quot;blessed with victory&quot; – after defeating an invasion force from the south in the Battle of Fýrisvellir which took place near Uppsala. A brother of Eric&#x27;s named Olof allegedly being the father of Styrbjörn the Strong, Eric&#x27;s main opponent in that battle, is part of the traditions about them.

The extent of Eric&#x27;s kingdom is unknown. In addition to the Swedish heartland around lake Mälaren it may have extended down along the Baltic Sea as far south as Blekinge. According to Adam of Bremen, and Saxo Grammaticus he was also King of Denmark after defeating King Sweyn Forkbeard. The Stone of Eric also describes a Swedish attack against Denmark as mentioned by Adam of Bremen. 

According to the Flateyjarbok, his success was largely due to an alliance with free farmers against an earl-class nobility, but archaeological findings suggest that the influence of that class diminished during the last part of the tenth century. Eric probably introduced a system of universal conscription known as ledung in the provinces around Mälaren.

In all probability he also founded the town of Sigtuna, which still exists and where the first Swedish coins were minted for his son and successor King Olof.

==Saga sources==

Eric the Victorious is named in a number of sagas, Nordic tales of history preserved from oral tradition. In various stories, he is described as the son of a Björn Eriksson and as having ruled together with his brother Olaf. One saga describes his marriage to the infamous Queen Sigrid the Haughty, daughter of a legendary Viking, Skagul Toste, and how in their divorce he gave her all of Gothenland as a fief. According to &quot;Eymund&#x27;s saga&quot; he then took a new queen, Aud, daughter of Haakon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway.

Before that, Eric&#x27;s brother Olaf died, and a new co-ruler was to be appointed, but the Swedes allegedly refused to accept Eric&#x27;s rowdy nephew Styrbjörn as such. Eric granted Styrbjörn 60 longships in which he sailed away for a seafaring existence as a Viking. He became the ruler of Jomsborg and an ally of Danish King Harold Bluetooth, whose daughter Tyra he married. Styrbjörn returned to Sweden with an army, although Harold and the Danish troops seem to have turned back. Eric won the Battle of Fýrisvellir, according to &quot;Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa&quot;, after making sacrifice to Odin and promising that, if victorious, he would give himself to Odin in ten years.

Two skaldic verses by Thorvaldr Hjaltason describe the alleged battle. The first expressly mentions how an Eric has utterly defeated an enemy host at a fortification at Fýrisvellir, while the second specifies that the Vikings were superior in numbers but nevertheless were handily captured when they attacked Sweden, and only those who fled survived. The runestones of Hällestad and Sjörup in Scania, then a part of Denmark, do mention a battle at Uppsala characterized by the defeat and flight of the attackers. These stones have traditionally been associated with the battle, but they also present chronological problems and may be from the next century.

Saxo Grammaticus also mentions that Erik ruled over Denmark for seven years after an invasion. He does not question the validity of the Swedish conquest of Denmark and claims that the Swedish invasion of Denmark was retaliation for Harald Bluetooth&#x27;s support of Styrbjörn the Strong. Saxo unlike Adam of Bremen mentions that Eric defeated Sweyn Forkbeard&#x27;s army decisively in a battle in Scania for the throne of Denmark. Snorri Sturlasson also mentions that Eric manfully defended the realm from invaders and that he also expanded the Swedish realm manfully. 

According to saga sources, Eric also had a beautiful daughter. A Swede named Åke desired her. Eric however forbade his marriage proposal, since he knew a king in Russia that he wanted to marry her off to. Åke also was an unworthy man for his daughter. The saga uses the word fylkeskonung to describe the Russian king. The fylkeskonungs all paid tributes to the Uppsala king according to the Yngling Saga and are described as client kings of the kings of Uppsala. Sometimes it means petty king.
After that marriage took place Åke got jealous and angry at the Russian king for taking his love. Erik married her off to the Russian king. 

Åke retaliated by traveling to Russia with a friend and killing the king and taking Eric&#x27;s daughter. Åke then allied himself with powerful Swedish jarls to avoid retaliation by Eric.
Eric did not want to risk a confrontation since that would lead to much bloodshed in a possible civil war. For some years nothing happened and Åke had a son Edmund, father of Ingvar the Far-Travelled, leader of the Rus expedition to the Caspian Sea. Eric and Åke later had a good relationship and became friends once again. 

Before the wedding, Haakon Jarl said that Eric should do something against Åke and that his actions against Eric must be punished. Haakon offered Eric gifts if he took revenge and offered to help him take revenge. Leaving a rival alive could risk his life in a potential attack for the throne by Åke. 

Eric then started a plot for revenge. Eric armed his guards and killed Åke when he was leaving the party drunk together with his drunken bodyguards. 

After that Eric started a purge where all jarls allied with Åke were mercilessly killed and their property was confiscated. He spared the child and raised it as his grandson and also spared his daughter and brought them home with him.

==Adam of Bremen==

German ecclesiastic chronicler Adam of Bremen (around 1075) provides by far the oldest narrative about King Eric, and it differs substantially from the sagas. As his source he refers to the current King Sweyn II of Denmark whom he interviewed for his chronicle. Adam of Bremen also uses a similar epithet as the sagas &quot;Victorius&quot; for Erik the &quot;Powerful&quot; or Erik the &quot;Great&quot; the Latin word &quot;potentissimus&quot;. Adam places Eric&#x27;s reign after that of a certain Emund Eriksson, without clarifying how they were related. He does not mention the Battle of Fýrisvellir but relates that Eric gathered a large army and invaded Denmark against King Sweyn Forkbeard. The direct reason for the attack is not given, but somehow it concerned an alliance between Eric and &quot;the very powerful king of the Polans, Bolesław (992–1025). He gave Eric his sister or daughter in marriage&quot;. That princess has been identified as Gunhild of Wenden, in some Nordic sources the daughter of a king &quot;Burislev&quot; (Bolesław). According to other interpretations, she was identical with a woman known in later sagas as Sigrid the Haughty, whose name is possibly a misunderstanding of the Old Polish name Świętosława. Eric&#x27;s invasion of Denmark was successful. Several battles were fought at sea, and there the Danish forces, attacked from the east by Slavs, were annihilated. After his victory, Eric kept Denmark for a time, while Sweyn was forced to flee, first to Norway, then to England, and finally to Scotland whose king received the refugee with kindness. 

According to Adam, Eric&#x27;s rule in Denmark coincided with increased Viking activity in northern Germany. A fleet of Swedish and Danish ships sailed up the Elbe and landed at Stade in Saxony. A Saxon army confronted the invaders but was badly defeated. Several prominent Saxons were captured and brought to the ships, while the Vikings ravaged the province with no resistance. One of the prisoners, a Margrave Siegfried, managed to escape at night with the help of a fisherman. The infuriated Vikings then maimed their remaining prisoners and threw them ashore. However, Siegfried and Duke Benno soon raised a new army and raided the Vikings encamped at Stade. Another Viking detachment was tricked deep into the desolate marsh of Glindesmoor by a captured Saxon knight and annihilated by pursuing Germans.

Adam characterises Eric as a heathen and initially very hostile to the Christian religion. Nevertheless, a number of missionaries were at work during his reign, foreigners as well as some belonging to recently converted Nordic families. Among them was Odinkar the Elder who preached in Funen, Zealand, Scania and Sweden. Eventually Eric agreed to baptism, presumably while staying in Denmark; and if so he was the first Swedish king to do so. Due to that significant event, missionaries were allowed to sail over from Denmark to Sweden where they &quot;worked valiantly in the name of the Lord&quot;. After some time, Eric is said to have forgotten the Christian faith and reverted to the religion of his ancestors. When Eric died, Sveyn Forkbeard returned from exile and regained Denmark. He also is alleged to have married Eric&#x27;s widow (whoever she was), mother of Eric&#x27;s successor King Olof. Thus an alliance between the Swedish and Danish royal houses was created.

Adam&#x27;s account seems to date the death of Eric the Victorious between 992, when the accession took place in Poland of his ally Boleslaw I (above), and 995, when his son Olof&#x27;s coinage began in Sigtuna. According to Snorre Sturlasson, Eric died in Uppsala. Discrepancies between Adam&#x27;s account and other sources have led to a variety of interpretations among Swedish historians, especially about Eric&#x27;s marriages. The details on his conquest of Denmark have been questioned. However, historian Sture Bolin considers it likely that the Swedish conquest of Denmark did occur, since it is supported by &quot;two&quot; independent sources (Saxo Grammaticus and Adam of Bremen, who got the information from the Danish king Sweyn II). Bolin also argues that Eric&#x27;s invasion of the Holy Roman Empire (as described by Adam of Bremen), virtually requires Eric to have been the king of Denmark.
According to a recent evaluation by Harrison, the conquest &quot;is not unlikely, at least if we consider it a loose suzerainty over powerful Danish lords&quot;. 
The Stone of Eric, believed to have been raised in about 995 C.E., bears an inscription that Ludvig Wimmer identified as a 
possible description of an attack on Hedeby by king Sweyn against Swedish defenders who had occupied the settlement after king Eric&#x27;s conquest.

==Family==
Various sources and sagas (see above) list King Eric&#x27;s wives as Sigrid, Świętosława, Gunhild and Aud, of which two or three may have been the same person but depicted differently and under different names. Such sources have also given Eric a total of four known children:
* Olof Skötkonung d. 1022, Eric&#x27;s only historically attested child
* Emund, allegedly ruled over part of the realm under his brother Olof
* Holmfrid, sometimes credited as a daughter, not a sister, of Olof and married to Sweyn Haakonsson
* Daughter, married to an Åke and grandmother of Ingvar the Far-Travelled

Eric&#x27;s nephew Styrbjörn and niece Gyrid were allegedly children of his semi-legendary brother and co-ruler Olof, mentioned in connection with Styrbjörn.

<text>The New Archies is an American animated sitcom produced by DIC Animation City, based upon the characters by Archie Comics. The series, originally produced for NBC&#x27;s Saturday morning schedule and broadcast from September 12 to December 5, 1987, depicted the characters of Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Jughead Jones, Reggie Mantle, and other students of Riverdale High School as pre-teens in junior high.

Archie produced an identically named and themed comic book series that ran alongside the animated series.

In the series, Veronica uses the dialect of an archetypal valley girl. In the animated series produced by Filmation and the radio show, she had a southern accent. Dilton Doiley did not appear on &quot;The New Archies&quot;, and was replaced by an African American child named Eugene. Eugene&#x27;s girlfriend Amani was also introduced in &quot;The New Archies&quot;, as was Archie&#x27;s dog, Red.

<doc id="454686" wikidata="Q3772186" url="?curid=454686" title="Archie's Weird Mysteries">
<text>Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries (French: &quot;Archie, mystères et compagnie&quot;) is an animated television series based on the characters by Archie Comics. The series premise revolves around a Riverdale High physics lab gone awry, making the town of Riverdale a &quot;magnet&quot; for B movie-style monsters. All the main characters solve strange mysteries in a format similar to both &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

Produced by Les Studios Tex and DIC Productions, L.P., the series was initially shown mornings on the PAX network premiering on 2 October 1999, often with infomercials bookending the program. The series eventually premiered in France on M6 on 19 January 2000.

==Voice cast and characters==
===Main===
* Andrew Rannells as Archie Andrews – a redheaded, freckled student at Riverdale High, and a reporter for the school newspaper. All of his news stories are centered around the surreal occurrences that take place within each episode and always end with &quot;...in a little town called Riverdale.&quot; Despite his clumsiness and rash decision-making, he is overall kind-hearted and brave, and frequently attracts girls, human or otherwise.
* America Young as Betty Cooper – a literal girl-next-door who is intelligent, comely, cute, level-headed, caring, and the head of the cheerleading squad. She is best friends with Veronica, despite them both competing for Archie&#x27;s affection. She has bright blonde hair that&#x27;s always worn in a ponytail.
* Camille Schmidt as Veronica Lodge – a beautiful, rich, popular, and somewhat self-centered girl. She is best friends with Betty, with whom she also shares a rivalry for Archie&#x27;s affection. Although both of them are frequently the target of Reggie&#x27;s advances, Veronica is targeted somewhat more often. Her hair is black, long and wavy, just like in the comics.
* Chris Lundquist as Jughead Jones – Archie&#x27;s eccentric yet insightful best friend who almost always has food on his mind, especially hamburgers. He generally does not like girls, although he is close friends with Betty, and he often butts heads with Veronica and Reggie. This version owns a litany of pets throughout the series, most notably Hot Dog, who is just as lazy as he is. Jughead usually wears a gray whoopee cap on his head, covering his choppy black hair.
* Paul Sosso as Reggie Mantle – an egotistical, aloof, prank-prone jock who has a one-sided crush on Veronica and is frenemies with Archie. He is generally the most disliked member of the group. In this particular incarnation, he has a niece named Amy.
* Ben Beck as Dilton Doiley – a bespectacled, nerdy genius who is friends with Archie and the others. His inventions usually help save the day, although they are sometimes the cause of the titular weird mysteries. In this incarnation, he does most of his work in the school lab (&quot;Invisible Archie&quot; reveals that this is a reward for his exceptional grades), where he is often isolated from his peers and all but lacks a social life. His catchphrase is, &quot;I&#x27;ll be super amalgamated!&quot;

===Supporting===
* Jerry Longe as Moose Mason – a slow-witted but sensitive jock who is a friend of the gang. He is the boyfriend of Midge Klump despite their intellectual differences and is very protective of her, particularly from Reggie&#x27;s advances.
* Michele Phillips as Ethel Muggs – a nerdy girl who has an open crush on Jughead. She is usually ignored by most of her peers despite her big heart. She is into magic and is also a beekeeper.
* Jill Anderson as Midge Klump – Moose&#x27;s girlfriend, in spite of their differences in intelligence. She is Reggie&#x27;s love interest, although she does not like him very much. She is into athletics and wants to become a stuntwoman.
* Chuck Clayton – a boy who is friends with Archie and the gang, seldom seen without Nancy at his side. He only speaks in &quot;Driven to Distraction,&quot; but is reduced to silent cameos elsewhere.
* Nancy Woods – a girl who is friends with Archie and the gang, seldom seen without Chuck at her side. She only speaks in &quot;Driven to Distraction,&quot; but is reduced to silent cameos elsewhere.
* Tony Wike as Mr. Waldo Weatherbee – the bald, short-tempered Principal of Riverdale High who has it in for Archie the most, blaming him for most of the weird events happening at school.
* Miss Grundy – the homeroom teacher of Archie and the gang, who has feelings for Mr. Weatherbee. Her first name was Geraldine in the original comics, but was changed Doris in the show.
* Matt Bross as Coach Kleats – the athletic coach at Riverdale High, who considers Moose his favorite student.
* John Michael Lee as Mr. Flutesnoot – Riverdale High&#x27;s stoic science teacher, whose favorite student is Dilton.
* Ryle Smith as Pop Tate – the owner and operator of the &quot;Pop Tate Chock&#x27;lit Shoppe&quot; shop where Archie and his friends hang out. He calls Jughead his best customer due to his large appetite.
* Jerry Longe as Smithers – Veronica&#x27;s cynical butler. He is aware of the supernatural, but is only interested in serving Veronica.
* John Michael Lee as Mr. Hiram Lodge – Veronica&#x27;s father who is disapproving of Archie.
* Fred Andrews – Archie&#x27;s father, who is of Scottish descent and cares deeply about his generations-old traditions.
* Pam Carter as Mary Andrews – Archie&#x27;s doting mother. &quot;Alternate Riverdales&quot; reveals that she met her husband at the local movie theater.

===Show-exclusive characters===
* Jerry Longe as Dr. Beaumont – the mysterious caretaker and owner of a curiosity shop, filled with magical artifacts that sometimes cause the episodes&#x27; conflicts. He provides advice to Archie and his friends as they solve mysteries.
* Lucinda – a Southern woman who lives in the woods outside of town. Considered to be a charmer, she practices voodoo magic, provides advice regarding the supernatural, and creates love potions.
* Mr. Fisk – the CEO of ZoomCo who, after discovering that his Zoom energy drink contains a mutant formula that causes some people to mutate into monsters, tries to bribe and stop Archie from telling the world on national TV. He convinces Archie not to tell the news, as doing so would destroy his company and many people&#x27;s jobs.
* Olga Karpuchi – the shy but intelligent civilian identity of a superheroine, named Supreme Girl. Her enemy is the villainous Dr. Arachnid, and they both hail from the Twelfth Dimension. During her stay at Riverdale High, she works with Archie on the school newspaper and has a crush on him. She only physically appears in &quot;Supreme Girl vs. Dr. Arachnid,&quot; but is first mentioned in &quot;The Jughead Incident.&quot;
* Robbie Dopkins – a friendly boy on Riverdale High&#x27;s athletic team, who debuts in &quot;Invisible Archie,&quot; where he enamors both Betty and Veronica due to his muscles. He is said to be the reason that Reggie was kicked from the track-and-field team. Following this appearance, he is reduced to silent cameos in other episodes.
* Jill Anderson as Cynthia Kim – the editor-in-chief for the Riverdale High paper who cares mostly about its viewership. Like most people, she can sometimes be skeptical of Archie&#x27;s stories.
* Vinny Wells (or Vinnie Wells) – a teenage delinquent who only appeared in the three episodes &quot;Archie&#x27;s Date with Fate&quot;, &quot;Alternate Riverdales&quot; and &quot;Teen Out of Time&quot;, where he and his future self were the main antagonists. He first appeared in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Date with Fate&quot;, when he was said to be breaking into the other students&#x27; lockers for money to buy nachos.
* John Michael Lee as Count Medlock – the leader of a vampire cult, who is the antagonist of &quot;I Was a Teenage Vampire&quot; and &quot;Halloween of Horror.&quot; He plots to bring about an eternal night, allowing vampires to roam about Riverdale freely with no fear of the sun.
* Michelle Phillips as Scarlet Helsing – a vampire girl who has a crush on Medlock and works to help bring his plans to fruition, butting heads with Archie and the gang in the process. At the end of the three-parter, she turns out to be the key to defeating her boss and helps the teens thwart him after he backstabs her.

== Episodes ==
==Broadcast==
===United States===
The series first ran in the United States on PAX, and was the first newly produced animated feature to first air on the network. It was planned to air alongside fellow DIC program &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; as part of an hour-long block, but the latter show instead aired on Fox Kids, leaving Archie to air alongside &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; on the channel&#x27;s PAX Kids strand. It later moved to a daily slot on the network and remained on PAX until late 2000.

In 2001, the show began to air on syndicated television stations throughout the United States, as a way to comply with their mandatory E/I regulations. The series would later be part of the syndicated DIC Kids Network block beginning in 2003, also to comply with E/I regulations.

From 2012 to 2018, the show reran on Qubo.

The full series has recently become available on Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video, and Tubi.

===France===
&quot;Archie, Mystère Et Compagnie&quot; first ran on M6 on 19 January 2000 as part of the channel&#x27;s M6 Kid strand, and later reran on Disney Channel and Toon Disney in the country.

==Production notes==
The theme song was written and performed by Mike Piccirillo. Musical underscore composers were Mike Piccirillo and Jean-Michel Guirao. The Riverdale vampires story arc episodes were put together and released on VHS as &quot;Archie and the Riverdale Vampires&quot;. The voice cast was provided by the Omaha Theater Company for Young People of Omaha, Nebraska.

==Comics==
An ashcan comic book tie-in also titled &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;, written by Paul Castiglia, pencilled by Bill Golliher, inked by Rick Koslowski and colored by Stephanie Coronado (née Vozzo) was published in 1999. This led to a February 2000 launch for an ongoing, regular-sized series with the same name and creative team. The first issue notably serves as an origin story for the canon&#x27;s premise, showcasing the implied lab incident that turned Riverdale into supernatural central, and the moment when Archie decided to start his &quot;Weird Mystery&quot; column.

&quot;Weird&quot; was dropped from the title starting with #25, signaling the end of the tie-in with the television series, and the comics were canceled at #34 after ten issues of doing straight mystery stories with no supernatural or science-fiction components.

==Films==
===Archie and the Riverdale Vampires===
Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries: Archie and the Riverdale Vampires was released onto VHS by Universal Studios Home Video on August 30, 2000, alongside fellow DIC movie &quot;Monster Mash&quot; and &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman&quot; as part of Universal&#x27;s &quot;Haunted Fun&quot; lineup. The film consists of shortened and edited versions of the episode &quot;Attack of the Killer Spuds&quot; and the Riverdale Vampires trilogy made to run at feature-length. Although the movie does not consist of any newly produced content, it contains newly-produced narration by Archie who talks about how Riverdale ended up how it was.

The episodes that made up the film were also included within the &quot;Monster Bash Fun Pack&quot; alongside the rest of the Universal Haunted Fun releases, but the episodes are shown in their TV versions.

===The Archies in JugMan===
The Archies in JugMan is an animated television film produced by DIC Entertainment as part of the &quot;DIC Movie Toons&quot; series of made-for-TV movies. The movie functions as a sequel to the series, utilizing the same character designs (although with different outfits and new looks) and much of the same crew and voice cast, and the similar theme of weird events happening in Riverdale.

It originally premiered on television on Nickelodeon on 3 November and was released on DVD and VHS shortly afterward by MGM Home Entertainment, followed by international airings on Disney Channel and Toon Disney.

==Home media releases==
===United States===
===United Kingdom===
===Australia===
All the Australian DVDs were released by MRA Entertainment.

<doc id="454689" wikidata="Q3497291" url="?curid=454689" title="State Fair of Texas">
<text>The State Fair of Texas is an annual state fair held in Dallas at historic Fair Park. The fair has taken place every year since 1886 except for varying periods during World War I and World War II as well as 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It usually begins the last Friday in September and ends 24 days later. The fair claims an annual attendance of over two million visitors through ticket scanning. The State Fair of Texas is considered one of the best in America as well as Dallas&#x27; signature event despite its troubled history.

==Attractions==

The State Fair of Texas&#x27;s opening day ceremonies are highlighted by the annual Friday parade rolling through downtown Dallas. In 2019, the parade moved to Fair Park. The fair also has a nightly parade called the Starlight Parade and a nightly light show called Illumination Sensation around the park&#x27;s esplanade. However, the start of the fair is largely viewed negatively by the residential, as the blight it creates is so severe that it depresses the real estate value of neighboring homes, which are already in a depressed neighborhood. In addition, nearby businesses lose money while the fair is in operation.

Traditionally, the centerpiece of the fair has been the annual college football game between Oklahoma and Texas, nicknamed the Red River Rivalry (historically known as both the &quot;OU-Texas Game&quot; or &quot;Texas-OU Game&quot;) and played in the Cotton Bowl at Fair Park. Also, the State Fair Classic, featuring Grambling State University and Prairie View A&amp;M University, is played at the Cotton Bowl during the fair. In 2010, Baylor and Texas Tech played their game during the fair for the first time. During the opening weekend of the 2013 fair, Army and Louisiana Tech played in the only Heart of Dallas Classic at the Cotton Bowl; it was abandoned thereafter. The Texas State Fair Football Showdown took place on the third weekend of the 2018 and 2019 fair and featured Southern and Texas Southern. In 2020, the Southern versus Texas Southern game moved to Arlington, Texas.

The State Fair of Texas is the only fair in the United States to include a full auto show, dating back to 1913. However, the Texas Museum of Automotive History was forced to pull out as a tenant, blaming the fair for forcing it to close down during the annual event.

The State Fair formerly featured &quot;Birds of the World&quot; where several birds would fly overhead. It was removed from the Fair lineup in 2014, only to return in 2019. The $5-million Texas Skyway is a gondola ride which only operates 24 days a year, transporting visitors around the fairgrounds. There is also a BMX bike show as well as dog and pig races. For children, puppet shows, Children&#x27;s Medical Center Barnyard, and Story Time also take place inside the fair.

In recent years, the fair has emphasized its reputation as an event featuring unique, albeit high-fat, foods. It has been known for years for Fletcher&#x27;s brand corny dogs. Recent years have seen the introduction of new unusual deep-fried items, including deep-fried Oreos, deep-fried Twinkies, deep-fried s&#x27;mores, deep-fried pork ribs, fried cheesecake; deep-fried butter, fried avocados, fried alligators, deep-fried peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwiches, and most recently a batter-based fried Coke. New foods in 2008 included chicken fried bacon and fried banana splits. For the 2012 fair, the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas added the deep-fried Samoa cookie in honor of the 100th Anniversary of Girl Scouts of the US and the Girl Scout 100th Anniversary Experience at the Texas Hall of State at the fair. People travel from all around the world to attend the State Fair of Texas, including former talk show host Oprah Winfrey.

==History==
The first state fair in Texas was established by the Mechanical and Blood Stock Association of Texas (MBSAT). The first fair convened in Houston on the north bank of Buffalo Bayou in 1870. The MBSAT hosted another state fair at the same location in 1871. Beginning in 1872, the fair moved to a new location south of Houston in an area more recently known as &quot;Midtown,&quot; until the last state fair held by the MBSAT in 1878. After its last fair, the MBSAT declared bankruptcy, and no other organization in Houston emerged to restart the state fair in Houston.

In its modern incarnation, the State Fair of Texas was charted as a private corporation by local businessmen. It was an immediate success and attracted thousands of people. However, in 1904 a series of events led to a financial crisis and not enough income was available to keep the fair running. Therefore, the businessmen sold it to the city of Dallas with the agreement that 24 days during the fall would be set aside annually for the fair and exhibition.

On February 10, 1942, a fire-alarm blaze raged unchecked for an hour in the automobile building at the State Fair park causing damage estimated at several hundred thousand dollars. One fireman was hospitalized after being overcome with smoke and a half dozen others were given treatment at the scene. Roy Rupard, secretary of the State Fair association, said the loss was covered by insurance.

Big Tex, a tall cowboy statue, has been its symbol since his introduction in 1952. In 1953, Big Tex&#x27;s jaw was hinged, so that he appears to &quot;speak&quot; the announcements that promote fair events. After a fire on October 19, 2012, destroyed the original Big Tex, he was rebuilt and reintroduced for the 2013 fair. Big Tex is claimed to be the world&#x27;s tallest cowboy.

Its Texas Star Ferris wheel was the largest in North America when it debuted in October 1985, just months before the Texas Sesquicentennial. It has since been dwarfed by Ferris wheels in Las Vegas and Orlando.

DART&#x27;s Fair Park Station and MLK Jr. Station opened in 2009 to serve Fair Park and the State Fair. In addition to regular service on the Green Line, the Red Line and Blue Line also run &quot;special event&quot; trains to Fair Park Station for major fair events.

In 2017, Foundation for Community Empowerment commissioned a major report laying a major portion of blame against how the State Fair of Texas has hindered development at and around Fair Park.

===Controversies===

A Segregated Fair

For the majority of time the State Fair of Texas has been in operation, it was a segregated fair. African Americans were allowed into the fair only on &quot;Negro Achievement Day,&quot; known colloquially as &quot;Nigger Day&quot; by the white population. The end of the segregated fair began in 1953 under increasing pressure to desegregate. In that year, African Americans were allowed in the fair for the full season, but were not served in restaurants or allowed on the midway. Only on Negro Achievement Day were African Americans allowed full access to the fairgrounds. The Dallas Negro Chamber of Commerce, under pressure from the African American community, began to denounce the State Fair as segregated. White Dallas leaders continued to assert that the fair was not segregated. In the mid-1950&#x27;s, then mayor R. L. Thornton, one of the founding men of the Dallas Citizens Council who helped fundraise for the 1936 Centennial Exposition, agreed to desegregate more, but continued to assert that some restaurants and attractions remain separate. Notably, two attractions that involved physical contact, the &quot;Laff in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Dodge &#x27;em Scooter&quot; rides, continued to be segregated.

In 1955, Juanita Craft organized a protest of the State Fair of Texas against its policy of admitting blacks only on &quot;Negro Achievement Day.&quot;

In addition, the fair once had a &quot;Colored People&#x27;s Day,&quot; &quot;Ku Klux Klan Day&quot; and, as recently as the 1980s, a day dedicated to the Confederacy. In the 1960s, the fair looked at market research showing that many white fairgoers were frightened by seeing black people on their way into the fair leading to an aggressive eminent domain campaign to buy nearby homes to convert the land into parking lots.

The State Fair in 1966 commissioned a report on the redevelopment of the fair, which concluded that the land around Fair Park should be &#x27;bought up and turned into a paved, lighted, fenced parking lot&quot; that would &#x27;eliminate the problem from sight&#x27;. &quot;If the poor Negroes in their shacks cannot be seen, all the guilt feelings…will disappear, or at least be removed from primary consideration&quot;.

The State Fair was criticized in October 2014 for spending over $5 million on attorneys fees to two insiders.

Despite a $30 million investment in Summer Adventures, the event was shuttered after just one season.

In August 2015, the State Fair was sanctioned more than $75,000 for filing a SLAPP suit against a lawyer who had requested financial documents from the State Fair. On August 2, 2016, the Dallas Court of Appeals reversed in its entirety the judgment against the State Fair of Texas, holding that the trial court erred in, among other things, finding that the State Fair&#x27;s lawsuit was a SLAPP suit.

Contrary to the fact that African-Americans weren&#x27;t allowed to participate in entertainment or eat at restaurants and concession stands on other days during the run, fair officials touted &quot;Negro Achievement Day&quot; as a way to recognize the accomplishments and progress of the Negro race in Texas and the United States.

==Economics, finances and management==

The economics, finances and management of the State Fair of Texas is a matter of public concern and study. The five main areas of concern are:

* What is the annual attendance of the fair?
* What economic impact does the fair have on people and businesses in the surrounding area?
* How much money does the State Fair provide for the benefit of improvements at Fair Park and elsewhere
* State fair staff compensation levels
* Audits

===Attendance===
Staff of the State Fair have traditionally reported that attendance at the fair runs in the vicinity each year of between 3 and 3.5 million people. These figures were disputed in an April 2016 study published by Tom Kelly, Ph.D., a professor of economics at Baylor University and the Director of Baylor University Center for Business and Economic Research, along with Bennet Hickok, an Economics student at Baylor. The Kelly/Hickok report argues that the attendance at the fair is about 1.5-1.7 million visitors a year, or about half of what state fair staff reported it to be. According to the 2017 State Fair of Texas Annual Report, the Fair attracted a total of 2,250,433 attendees during the 2017 event with roughly 93,000 daily guests. The total annual reported attendance for 2018 dropped to 2,049,119 with a net operating revenue loss of $3,199,044 for the year. 

===Economic impact on surrounding businesses===
The 2016 Kelly/Hickok study found that the State Fair generates around $50 million for the area economy. This is in contrast to the figure of $600 million in impact that the State Fair itself has traditionally reported.

===How excess revenue is spent===
The State Fair has a lease with Fair Park, the terms of which require that any profit or excess revenue it generates be spent &quot;for the development and enhancement of Fair Park and the Fair&quot;. In May 2016, the State Fair released a list of capital projects for the past 10 years, detailing how the fair had spent their excess revenue. According to media reports, 90% of excess revenue was spent on projects that solely benefited the State Fair. A survey of Fair Park revealed out of the 277 acres available, 200 are covered in asphalt or concrete, compared to 10 acres of green space.

===Staff compensation===

In 2014, Errol McKoy, the former President of the State Fair of Texas, received $1.425 million in compensation. Excessive executive compensation is a constant and major complaint of the fair.
===Audits===

On May 13, 2016, the City of Dallas Auditor, Craig Kinton, released an audit regarding Fair Park Business Partners, which included the State Fair of Texas. The audit concluded the City of Dallas had no way to ensure the State Fair was adequately investing in Fair Park, per the terms of the contract between the City of Dallas and State Fair.

<text>The Brampton Guardian is a locally distributed, free, weekly community newspaper in Brampton, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
In the late 1950s, the Bramalea development began, under the oversight of Bayton Holdings Ltd., then Bramalea Consolidated Developments Limited. An attempt at a self-contained community, the &quot;satellite city&quot; included industrial parks, shopping centres, and other conveniences. Bramalea Limited created a newspaper for the community, &quot;The Bramalea Guardian&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; was first published August 13, 1964, as a weekly in tabloid format publication.

It was created as a corporately run publication, and was sold in 1966 to &quot;The Toronto Telegram&quot;. The paper soon began running two front pages, one with a Bramalea-oriented lead story, the other with a Brampton-based story; the title of the publication became &quot;The Brampton/Bramalea Guardian&quot;. When the &quot;Telegram&quot; closed, Douglas Bassett sold the &quot;Guardian&quot; to the Inland Publishing chain, owned by &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;. In 1971, the newspaper transitioned to broadsheet format, and in 1973, it became &quot;The Brampton Guardian&quot;. In 1981, Inland transferred the paper to Metroland, where it has remained ever since. In 1988, weekly circulation was 120,000, and the publication had a staff of 150. From 1973 to 1988, &quot;The Brampton Guardian&quot; has won over 100 awards for community journalism.

The Region of Peel Archives, part of the Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives, holds the newspaper&#x27;s photographic records from both &quot;The Bramalea Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Brampton Guardian&quot; eras.

A short-lived rival, &quot;The Brampton Bulletin&quot;, lasted from 2005 until early November 2006.

==Segments==
===&quot;The Brampton Booster&quot;===
The final issue was published January 6, 2011; it was replaced the next week by Thursday edition of &quot;The Brampton Guardian&quot;.

===&quot;South Asian Focus&quot;===
The Region of Peel and the wider Greater Toronto Area continues to welcome a rapidly growing visible minority community. The minority is now becoming the majority in several pockets of the GTA, and South Asians spearhead this demographic shift. 

&quot;South Asian Focus&quot; was established based on these trends in early 2007 as a weekly newspaper addressing issues of interest to all South Asian communities.

<doc id="454694" wikidata="Q2327249" url="?curid=454694" title="Beverly Hills Teens">
<text>Beverly Hills Teens is an animated children&#x27;s television program produced by DIC Animation City. Distributed by Access Syndication and originally airing in first-run syndication in the United States from September 21, 1987 through December 18, 1987 and airing in The Children&#x27;s Channel in the United Kingdom from March 1, 1994 through February 28, 1998, the series consists of one extended season, comprising a total of 65 episodes, each 30 minutes long. After its original run, the series continued to be broadcast as part of a syndication package featuring rebroadcasts of &quot;Maxie&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot;, and has subsequently acquired the retronym Beverly Hills Teen Club.

Developed by Jack Olesker, Michael Maliani and Barry O&#x27;Brien, and executive produced by Andy Heyward, the series&#x27; namesake teenagers reside in the exclusive enclave of Beverly Hills, California and are shown to have exaggerated wealth, exemplified by mansions, yachts, and limousines, while navigating typical teenage concerns, including schoolwork, friendships, and romantic rivalries. In 1989, the series was nominated for the Youth in Film Award (now known as the Young Artist Award) as &quot;Best Animated Series.&quot;

==Development==

In January 1987, the wire services reported that Access Syndication, which was partnered with DIC Enterprises and Coca-Cola Telecommunications, had three new animated children&#x27;s series in development for the fall of that year. The three series said to be in various stages of production at that time were &quot;Tiffany Blake&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Teens&quot;. While &quot;Starcom&quot; and &quot;Teens&quot; were produced, &quot;Blake&quot; never got past the development stages. 

Described by one columnist as &quot;[s]poiled rich kids who attend classes equipped with Louis XIV antique desks&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Teens&quot; was touted by producers as a response to the more violent series aimed at children, maintaining that the new series would be less action-based and more character driven, and would provide &quot;wholesome role models for kids.&quot;

President of Access Syndicate, Ritch Colbert lamented the state of children&#x27;s entertainment at the time, stating &quot;Children&#x27;s programming these days is dominated by neo-miiltaristic, boy-toy animation.&quot; Citing shows like &quot;SilverHawks&quot;, &quot;ThunderCats&quot; and &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, which were popular animated series of the time, Colbert continued &quot;Where are the &quot;Tom and Jerrys&quot;, the &quot;Flintstones&quot;, the rich characters for children to nurture and develop and identify with?&quot;

When questioned as to whether &quot;money-happy&quot; teens residing in Beverly Hills would be the best examples for children, Colbert countered &quot;Well, they may be rather more wealthy than most teenagers, but they have typical teenagers&#x27; problems and the important thing is they are fully realized personalities.&quot;

While in development, early names for the series&#x27; four lead characters were reported as &quot;Troy&quot;, &quot;Chrissie&quot;, &quot;Raven&quot; and &quot;Pierce&quot;. Although the boys&#x27; names would remain into the production of the series, the girls&#x27; names were subsequently changed, with &quot;Chrissie&quot; eventually becoming series protagonist &quot;Larke&quot;, and &quot;Raven&quot; eventually being renamed &quot;Bianca.&quot;

==Premise==

The series takes place in Beverly Hills, California, and follows a fictional &quot;Teen Club&quot;, consisting of a group of wealthy teenagers, shown to be approximately sixteen years old. Common settings include the teens&#x27; palatial high school, the country club, the local salon and spa, and the shopping thoroughfare on Rodeo Drive. The lead protagonist is Larke, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed high school student and fashion model who is shown to be kind and generous to her friends. Her romantic lead is handsome Troy, who, like Larke, is shown to be genial and likable, and is often the object of affection for the other girls.

Providing much of the series&#x27; conflict is raven-haired beauty, Bianca, who views Larke as her primary rival for everything from the lead in the high school play, to the title of Homecoming Queen, and, most importantly, Troy&#x27;s affections. Sharing her disdain for the perfect coupling is Pierce, an effeminate and narcissistic boy who presents himself as a &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot;, but resents Troy&#x27;s relationship with Larke. Storylines frequently involve Bianca or Pierce, or sometimes both working together, plotting and/or manipulating events in an attempt to sabotage Larke and Troy&#x27;s romance, as well as various other relationships within the Teen Club.

The other girls of the Teen Club include girl Jett, cowgirl Blaze, aspiring actress Nikki, southern belle Tara, Teen Club President Shanelle, and gossip columnist Switchboard. The other boys of the Teen Club include rocker boy Gig, surfer boy Radley, self-promoter Buck Huckster, and Bianca&#x27;s chauffeur Wilshire. In addition to their peer group, the teens are often accompanied by two youngsters, boy genius Chester and Pierce&#x27;s little sister Jillian, while the rivalry between Larke&#x27;s cat &quot;Tiara&quot; and Bianca&#x27;s poodle &quot;Empress&quot; frequently provides the series with its more traditional slapstick comedy elements.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
In the 21st century, &quot;Beverly Hills Teens&quot; garnered a resurgence of attention from entertainment websites and newspaper columnists reminiscing about their childhoods in the 1980s. BuzzFeed writer, Brian Galindo playfully touted the camp appeal of the cartoon as &quot;embodying &#x27;80s decadence&quot;, describing the series as &quot;the original &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, but way, way more ridiculous.&quot;

Dilshan Boange, columnist for the Sri Lankan newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot; cited the series (and, in particular, its theme song) for exporting American &quot;epicurean&quot; ideals, writing &quot;The &quot;Beverly Hills Teens&quot; sing out the status quo of monopoly over &#x27;style&#x27; and how it&#x27;s &#x27;done right&#x27;. It is a message to lesser mortals to take note. The center tells you what is &#x27;in&#x27; and what&#x27;s not. [...] Have you given much thought to how many US TV shows market their lifestyles to us on a daily basis through TV shows that speak of the &#x27;American dream&#x27;?&quot;

In Bulgaria, the show was first broadcast in 2002 on bTV as a part of the FoxKids block along other &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s shows such as &quot;Masked Rider&quot; and &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;. Thus, the age cohort that grew up watching the show there were teens born from the late &#x27;80s to children born in the &#x27;90s. This introduced the &#x27;80s TV show to a much younger audience, including both Millennials and Generation Z members.

==Accolades==
==Home media==
During the series&#x27; lifespan, select episodes were released in the NTSC VHS format by Golden Book Video. In 1990, select episodes were released on single episode VHS tapes by Celebrity Home Entertainment as part of their Just for Kids Mini Features line.

On April 26, 2007, Déclic Images released a Volume 1 DVD box set featuring the first 23 French dubbed episodes of the series - known as &quot;Bécé Bégé&quot; (BCBG...short for &quot;Bon Chic, Bon Genre&quot; or &quot;Good Style, Good Class&quot;) in France - in the Region 2 format. On November 28, 2007, Volumes 2 and 3, containing 20 and 22 episodes respectively, were released. On May 17, 2010, all 3 Volumes were made available for purchase as a 3-box set of the entire series.

On February 19, 2013, Mill Creek Entertainment released a Volume 1 DVD set featuring the first 32 episodes of the series in the Region 1 format which includes a bonus episode of &quot;Heathcliff&quot;. On October 1, 2013, Volume 2, featuring the remaining 33 episodes, was released.

<text>Walter Moers (; born 24 May 1957) is a German comic artist, illustrator and writer. He is the creator of the character of Captain Bluebear and became a best-selling author in Europe with his Zamonia novels.

==Life==

Moers was born in Mönchengladbach. According to his own statements, he ended his school career prematurely and initially supported himself by doing odd jobs. He began a commercial apprenticeship, but did not finish it. The odd jobs included his first drawing commissions, such as little bedtime stories for the &quot;Sandmännchen&quot;. Moers acquired his drawing skills through self-study.

Walter Moers is married and has lived in Hamburg since 1992. He is considered publicity-shy, does not make public appearances, gives his few interviews by e-mail and rarely allows himself to be photographed. The only recordings of him that exist are older photographs and a short film in the NDR archives showing Moers at an exhibition in 1994. Some of the few pictures also date from before 2000, and in the case of some of them it is disputed whether the person depicted is really Walter Moers. His dealings with the public have meanwhile become a kind of trademark, so that he is often dubbed a &quot;phantom&quot;. Therefore, biographical information on Moers must be treated with caution, as there are few truly reliable sources.

== Work ==

=== Zamonia series ===
Walter Moers&#x27;s Zamonia novels are works of fantasy literature presented as literary fragments of the world of Zamonia. In the course of the publications, Moers&#x27;s authorship was fictitiously reduced further and further, from author and helper (&quot;The 13½ Lives of Captain Bluebear&quot;) to editor and illustrator (&quot;Ensel and Krete&quot;, &quot;The City of Dreaming Books&quot;) to second-tier editor (&quot;The Alchemaster&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;).

The books are characterised by their intermedial and intertextual presentation. Thus, there are many references to other works of literature, film and music. The parallels are sometimes so obvious that the Zamonia novels have been called &quot;plagiarism poetry&quot; and &quot;art of copying&quot;. However, the combination of maps, illustrations and texts in which the novels are written also contributes to the intermediality. Both adolescent and adult readers are given as the target audience, although it can be assumed that Moers intended the works primarily for adults. As of 2024 there are eight books in the series (of which five have been translated to English):

* &quot;The 13½ Lives of Captain Bluebear&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Ensel und Krete&quot; (2000)
* &quot;Rumo and His Miraculous Adventures&quot; (2003)
* &quot;The City of Dreaming Books&quot; (2004)
* &quot;The Alchemaster&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2007)
* &quot;The Labyrinth of Dreaming Books&quot; (2011)
* &quot;Der Bücherdrache&quot; (2019)
* &quot;Die Insel der Tausend Leuchttürme&quot; (2023)

==== Language and style ====
Moers&#x27; style is overall strongly influenced by the tradition of the grotesque. The Zamonia novels are in themselves easy to understand and partly influenced by everyday language, and therefore belong more to popular literature. However, by repeatedly alluding to works that are usually considered &quot;canonical&quot; through intermedial and intertextual references, sometimes even whole set pieces, Moers blurs or negates the sometimes imaginary boundary between &quot;high literature&quot; and &quot;trivial literature&quot;.

Among the obvious references are the dedication of entire novels; with &quot;Ensel und Krete&quot;, inspired by the Grimm&#x27;s fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel, and &quot;The Alchemaster&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, behind which Gottfried Keller&#x27;s novella &quot;Spiegel, das Kätzchen&quot; is hidden. In addition, elements from Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, William Goldman&#x27;s &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; or Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; are evident.

==== Translations ====
Walter Moers&#x27; works have already been translated into over 20 languages, including mainly the Zamonia novels. Because of the many stylistic devices and word creations, translating Moers&#x27; novels is considered a particular challenge. For example, the translator of most of the works into English, John Brownjohn, describes how many names had to be Latinised and the large number of anagrams had to be re-imagined. Several works dealt with translation problems based on Walter Moers&#x27; works and showed difficulties in translating neologisms and phrasemes.

=== Comics ===
His best-known comic characters are:
* &quot;Das kleine Arschloch&quot; (English: The Little Asshole), a precocious and irreverent little boy who constantly gets one over on the adults.
* &quot;Der alte Sack&quot; (English: The Old Curmudgeon), a terminally ill old man in a wheel chair who makes sarcastic comments on what he sees.
* &quot;Adolf, die Nazisau&quot; (English: Adolf, the Nazi Swine), an absurd satirical interpretation of Adolf Hitler in today&#x27;s world.
* &quot;Käpt&#x27;n Blaubär&quot; (English: Capt&#x27;n Bluebear), a sea-faring bear with blue fur, who spins ridiculous pirate yarns, all of which, he claims, are true.

<text>The Stuttgarter Hymnus-Chorknaben (Stuttgart hymn choir boys) is a German boys&#x27; choir founded in Stuttgart in 1900 by the Swabian entrepreneur in 1900.

== History ==
Lechler&#x27;s models were the Thomanerchor and the Dresdner Kreuzchor. After World War II, the choir was continued in 1946 by , who conducted the group until 1987. The boys soon reached a high artistic level, which was also recognised abroad. Eckhard Weyand succeeded Wilhelm, leading the choir until 1992.

From 1992 until 2010 the choir was directed by Kirchenmusikdirektor Hanns-Friedrich Kunz, who retired in March 2010. The choir has been led by since. Even though churches and concert halls in Baden-Württemberg are the centre of their public appearances, the choir was on successful concert tours through Germany and Europe.

The choir has a broad repertoire of sacred vocal music, especially music by Johann Sebastian Bach and other Baroque composers. The choir performs in church services.

About 170 boys and 30 young men come together to rehearse in Stuttgart once week, because the choir has no boarding school. The boys start to learn reading easy music and dealing with musical basics at an age of seven or eight years. Later, usually after three years, the boys are introduced to the literature of the concert choir and start to fully participate in concerts. After the voice has changed, the boys can sing as tenors or basses. Skilled voice teachers support the singers in individual voice lessons.

<doc id="454697" wikidata="Q1561583" url="?curid=454697" title="Maurice Ewing">
<text>William Maurice &quot;Doc&quot; Ewing (May 12, 1906 – May 4, 1974) was an American geophysicist and oceanographer.

Ewing has been described as a pioneering geophysicist who worked on the research of seismic reflection and refraction in ocean basins, ocean bottom photography, submarine sound transmission (including the SOFAR channel), deep sea core samples of the ocean bottom, theory and observation of earthquake surface waves, fluidity of the Earth&#x27;s core, generation and propagation of microseisms, submarine explosion seismology, marine gravity surveys, bathymetry and sedimentation, natural radioactivity of ocean waters and sediments, study of abyssal plains and submarine canyons.

==Biography==
He was born in Lockney, Texas, where he was the eldest surviving child of a large farm family. He won a scholarship to attend Rice University, earning a BA with honors in 1926. He completed his graduate studies at the same institution, earning an MA in 1927 and being awarded his PhD in 1931. In 1928 he was married to Avarilla Hildenbrand, and the couple had a son. The couple divorced in 1941.

Ewing worked as an instructor at the Rice Institute while pursuing his PhD before joining the faculty at Lehigh University in 1930, where he served until 1944. While at Lehigh, he was instrumental in initiating a program in geophysics. In 1944 he married Margaret Sloan Kidder, with whom he had four children.

He moved to Columbia University, becoming a professor of geology in 1947. In 1959 he was named the Higgins Professor of Geology at Columbia. Dr. Ewing (often simply called &#x27;Doc&#x27; by those who worked with him) was the founder (established in 1949) and first director of Lamont Geological Observatory (now known as Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) in Palisades, New York) where he worked with J. Lamar Worzel (gravity specialist), Dr. Frank Press (seismologist), Jack Nafe, Jack Oliver, and geologists and oceanographic cartographers Dr. Bruce Heezen and Marie Tharp.

The former LDEO research vessel &quot;R/V Maurice Ewing&quot; was named in his honor.

He divorced a second time, and married his third wife Harriet Greene Bassett in 1965. In 1972 he joined the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and was named the head of the Division of Earth and Planetary Sciences of the Marine Biomedical Institute.

During his career he published over 340 scientific papers. He served as president of the American Geophysical Union and the Seismological Society of America. He led over 50 oceanic expeditions. He made many contributions to oceanography, including the discovery of the SOFAR Channel, the invention of the sofar bomb, and did much fundamental work on plate tectonics. While he was working on SOFAR, Ewing engaged in deep water photography, partly as a hobby and partly to help the government identify lost ships destroyed by U-boats. He was the chief scientist on board the Glomar Challenger. He originated Project Mogul, an early program to detect Soviet nuclear weapons tests.

Ewing suffered a fatal stroke in 1974 in Galveston, Texas.

<doc id="454698" wikidata="Q3178296" url="?curid=454698" title="List of JCP/WCW closed-circuit events and pay-per-view events">
<text>This is a list of all closed-circuit television and pay-per-view events held by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and its predecessor Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP).

From 1983 to 1987, these events aired live on closed-circuit television under the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) banner. Beginning in 1987, the events would air live on pay-per-view television. In November 1988, JCP sold its assets to the Turner Broadcasting System, which rebranded the company as World Championship Wrestling; they would later leave the NWA in 1991. In 1998 and early 1999, PPV events were promoted using the dual WCW/nWo brands.

In 2001, the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE) purchased the assets of WCW, including the video libraries of all previous NWA and WCW pay-per-views, and the ownership rights of the names of these events. To date WWE has only promoted one pay-per-view event using the name of a former WCW PPV, The Great American Bash, from 2004 until 2009. In 2012, it was rebooted as a live SmackDown special and in 2020, it was used as a two-week show as part of the NXT brand followed in 2021 by a special episode on one night. Also in 2020, the Halloween Havoc event name would be revived, once again as a special episode of NXT. In 2017, WWE revived the Starrcade name for a non-televised house show and then would show a portion of the 2018 and 2019 iterations of the event on the WWE Network. Both The Great American Bash and Halloween Havoc names would rotate between special episodes and live streaming events as WWE ceased airing NXT pay-per-views from 2022 and has aired solely on the WWE Network and Peacock. 

Beginning in 2014, nearly all NWA and WCW pay-per-view events were made available on the WWE Network and Peacock.

<text>The Argentina national football team (), nicknamed La Albiceleste (&#x27;The White and Sky Blue&#x27;), represents Argentina in men&#x27;s international football and is administered by the Argentine Football Association, the governing body for football in Argentina.

They are the reigning world champions, having won the most recent World Cup in 2022, earning their third star shown by the team&#x27;s crest. Overall, Argentina has appeared in a World Cup final six times, a record equaled by Italy and surpassed only by Brazil and Germany. Argentina played in the first ever final in 1930, which they lost 4–2 to Uruguay. The following final appearance came 48 years later, in 1978, when the team captained by Daniel Passarella defeated the Netherlands 3–1 in extra time, becoming world champions for the first time. Captained by Diego Maradona, Argentina won their second World Cup eight years later, in 1986, with a 3–2 final victory over West Germany. They reached the final once more under the guidance of Maradona, in 1990, but were ultimately beaten 1–0 by West Germany. A few decades later, Argentina, led by Lionel Messi made their fifth final appearance in 2014, losing to Germany 1–0 after extra time. In 2022, again captained by Messi, they were crowned world champions for the third time, the fourth-most of any country, beating France 4–2 on penalties, following a 3–3 draw after extra time. The team&#x27;s World Cupwinning managers are César Luis Menotti in 1978, Carlos Bilardo in 1986 and Lionel Scaloni in 2022. In addition, Argentina has also been very successful in the Copa América, with a record 16 titles, most recently winning the 2024 edition. They are also the only nation to have won the Copa América three consecutive times: they did it in 1945, 1946 and 1947. Furthermore, Argentina won the inaugural FIFA Confederations Cup in 1992 and is the most successful team in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, having won it twice, in 1993 and 2022. The national team also won the Panamerican Championship in 1960. In total, with 23 official titles won as of 2024, Argentina holds the record in senior official titles won.

Argentines Guillermo Stábile in 1930 and Mario Kempes in 1978 were the top-scoring players at their respective World Cups. Since the Golden Ball for the tournament&#x27;s best player was officially awarded by FIFA in 1982, Argentina players have won it three times: Maradona in 1986 and Messi in 2014 and 2022. Individually for Argentina, Lionel Messi is the all-time most-capped player with 191 matches and the highest goalscorer with 112 goals. , Argentina ranks 1st in the FIFA Men&#x27;s World Ranking.

Argentina is known for having rivalries with Brazil, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Uruguay, and France.

== History ==


The first ever match Argentina played was against Uruguay on 20 June 1902. The match, which was the first international for both sides, was held in Montevideo, and Argentina won 6–0. During the first years of its existence, Argentina only played friendly matches against other South American teams. The reasons for this varied, including long travel times between countries and the interruption due to World War I.

&quot;La Albiceleste&quot; has appeared in World Cup finals six times, including the first ever final on 30 July 1930, which they lost 4–2 to Uruguay. Argentina won their next final on 25 June 1978, beating the Netherlands 3–1. Eight years later, in 1986, Argentina led by Diego Maradona won their second title with a 3–2 victory over West Germany. Under the guidance of Maradona, they reached the final again, in 1990, but ultimately lost 1–0 to West Germany, by a much-disputed penalty. Led by Lionel Messi, Argentina reached the final in 2014, where they were beaten 1–0 by Germany in extra time. In 2022, again under the captaincy of Messi, Argentina won their third World Cup, beating France 4–2 on penalties, following a 3–3 draw after extra time. The team&#x27;s World Cupwinning managers are César Luis Menotti in 1978, Carlos Bilardo in 1986 and Lionel Scaloni in 2022.

Argentina has also been very successful in the South American Football Championship, the Copa América, winning it 16 times; they were crowned champions most recently in 2024. The team also won the inaugural FIFA Confederations Cup in 1992 and the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions in 1993 and 2022.

In March 2007, Argentina reached the top of the FIFA Men&#x27;s World Ranking for the first time.

== Home stadium ==
Argentina plays most of its home matches at River Plate&#x27;s stadium, Estadio Monumental, in Buenos Aires, although the team also uses various other venues frequently, such as Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades and Boca Juniors&#x27; stadium, La Bombonera. Those venues, along with Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes and Estadio San Juan del Bicentenario, were used for the 2022 World Cup qualification. Additionally, Argentina played some matches at Rosario Central&#x27;s stadium, Estadio Gigante de Arroyito, during their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign.

GEBA Stadium was the first stadium Argentina used for its home matches; that includes the Copa Newton match against Uruguay held on 13 September 1908, which has a historic significance for being the first time Argentina wore the light blue and white-striped jersey in an official match, which has since then been the defining uniform up to the present day. GEBA was also used for the Copa Centenario Revolución de Mayo, the first competition held between South American national teams, considered the predecessor of Copa América, organised by the Argentine Football Association (AFA) in 1910. Most recently, Argentina played at GEBA on 19 October 1919, winning the Copa Premier Honor Argentino after a 6–1 victory over Uruguay.

Furthermore, Estadio Sportivo Barracas is also considered a memorable venue for Argentina; the stadium was commonly used by Argentina from 1920 to 1932. Playing at the stadium for &quot;La Albiceleste&quot; on 2 October 1924, forward Cesáreo Onzari scored directly from a corner kick, the first such incident in football, when Argentina beat Uruguay 2–1; such goals are now often referred as &quot;Olympic goals&quot; due to the fact that Uruguay had just won the 1924 Olympic title. Sportivo Barracas was later demolished after 1936.

=== Kit ===

The first kit ever worn by Argentina, in their official debut against Uruguay in 1902, included a light blue shirt. On 2 July 1908, Argentina debuted a shirt with light blue vertical stripes on a white jersey, which they used when they played a side formed of Campeonato Paulista players at Velódromo Paulistano; they used the jersey in an official match against Uruguay on 13 September 1908, and the striped jersey has remained as the definitive kit for Argentina ever since then. The team&#x27;s away kits have been in dark blue shades, with the colours of shorts and socks varying from time to time.

Argentina has also sported other kits; on 3 June 1919 in Rio de Janeiro, playing against Brazil, Argentina wore a light blue kit, similar to that of Uruguay, out of respect for Roberto Chery, a substitute goalkeeper for Uruguay, who had collapsed and died during a match against Chile at the 1919 South American Championship; the match between Argentina and Brazil was organised by the Brazilian Football Confederation for the benefit of Chery&#x27;s relatives. At the 1958 World Cup, Argentina wore the yellow jersey of Swedish club IFK Malmö against West Germany, as the team had arrived in Sweden without an away kit.
At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, the then manager, Carlos Bilardo, asked the team&#x27;s kit supplier, Le Coq Sportif, for lighter blue shirts for their quarter-final against England in three days, but they could not be provided. Then, a member of the coaching staff scoured the shops of Mexico City for 38 plain shirts, which were transformed with an improvised version of the AFA emblem embroidered on the shirts and silvery American football numbers ironed to the backs.

Sporting the makeshift jerseys, Argentina beat England on 22 June, with Diego Maradona scoring his famous &quot;Hand of God goal&quot;. Afterwards, the shirt became a symbol of the occasion and an important collector&#x27;s item.

At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Argentina debuted a black away kit; and at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, they wore a purple away kit in a competitive match for the first time.

In November 2024, Argentina released a kit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the beginning of their partnership with Adidas back in 1974. It was used in the qualifier match for the 2026 FIFA World Cup against the Peru national football team

=== Kit suppliers ===

=== Crest ===

Argentina has used the logo of the Argentine Football Association as its emblem since it was first worn at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden; the logo was added to the team&#x27;s jackets, but not the shirts. The emblem was not used on jerseys until 16 November 1976, when Argentina played the Soviet Union at Estadio Monumental. At the beginning, the crest used did not include a laurel wreath, which was first added for the 1982 World Cup.

As a respected and common practice, two stars were added above the crest in 2004, symbolising Argentina&#x27;s World Cup titles in 1978 and 1986. In 2022, a third star was added after Argentina were crowned world champions for the third time.

== Rivalries ==

=== Brazil ===

Argentina and Brazil have a fierce rivalry which is one of the oldest in South America. Matches between the two teams, even those that are only friendly matches, are often marked by notable and controversial incidents. The rivalry has also been referred to as the &quot;Battle of the Americas.&quot; FIFA has described it as the &quot;essence of football rivalry&quot;.

The rivalry has extended to comparisons between Pelé and Diego Maradona. Some of their countrymen also feature regularly in such debates. The next most notable pair are perhaps Garrincha (Brazilian) and Alfredo Di Stéfano (Argentine). The most dominant figures from the two countries in the modern game are Neymar (Brazilian) and Lionel Messi (Argentine). Both Pelé and Maradona have declared Neymar and Messi their respective &quot;successors&quot;.

=== England ===

With a rivalry stemming from the 1966 World Cup and intensified by the Falklands War of 1982, Argentina and England have had numerous confrontations in World Cup tournaments. Among them was the quarter-final match in 1986, where Diego Maradona scored two goals against England. The first was a handball, but was ruled legal by the referee. The second, scored minutes later, saw Maradona passing five England outfield players before scoring, and is often described as one of, if not the greatest goal in football history.

The nations were paired together in the Round of 16 at the 1998 World Cup, won by Argentina on penalties, and again at the group stage in 2002, England winning 1–0 through a penalty by David Beckham who had been sent off in the tie four years earlier.

=== Germany ===

Argentina has played Germany in seven FIFA World Cup matches including three FIFA World Cup finals: In 1986 Argentina won 3–2, but in the 1990 and 2014 it was the Germans who were the victors by a 1–0 scoreline both times.

In 1958 they met for the first time in the group stage, where Argentina suffered a 1–3 loss to defending champions West Germany. In 1966 both again faced each other in the group stage which ended in a scoreless draw. In 2006, they met in the quarter-finals; Argentina lost on penalties after a 1–1 draw, which was followed by a brawl on the pitch involving several players. They met again at the same stage in 2010, this time ending with a 4–0 victory for Germany. They played each other for the third consecutive World Cup in the Brazil 2014 event&#x27;s final, where Argentina was defeated in extra time by a score of 1–0.

=== Mexico ===

Argentina has a minor rivalry with Mexico, which developed in the 1990s. The rivalry is considered one-sided as Argentines do not consider Mexico as rivals. Although the first official match between both nations came in the 1930 FIFA World Cup where Argentina beat Mexico 6–3 in the group stage, the rivalry emerged during the late twentieth century, especially after the 1993 Copa América final, where Argentina beat Mexico 2–1. That was the first time a non-CONMEBOL nation played in a Copa América final, and the first final played between both sides.

The rivalry has continued in club competitions, where Argentine and Mexicans first met in 1968 Copa Interamericana. The rivalry between both nations at club level increased during the late 1990s, when Mexican clubs were invited to participate in Copa Libertadores, where they played memorable matches against Boca Juniors.

During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, some Mexican and Argentine fans had a fight in Doha prior to the match between both sides, among great animosity. Both supporters fought again inside Lusail Stadium after the match that Argentina won 2–0, giving Argentina a chance to qualify and forcing Mexico to win against Saudi Arabia to qualify, which ended with Argentina and Poland qualifying and Mexico being eliminated alongside Saudi Arabia.

This sense of rivalry is more keenly felt by Mexican supporters and media, since Argentines do not consider Mexico rivals like Brazil, Germany, Uruguay or England.

=== Netherlands ===

Considered by sports media to be two historically great teams, the Argentines and Dutch have developed an intense rivalry. They have met ten times in total, including six times during the World Cup.

The two teams first met on 26 May 1974 in an international friendly, won by the Netherlands 4–1. Their most high-profile matchup occurred in the 1978 World Cup final which was won by Argentina. One of the most recent and intense meetings happened in the 2022 World Cup, a 2–2 draw where Argentina advanced on penalties, in what is known as the Battle of Lusail.

=== Nigeria ===
A recurrent rivalry developed from the 1990s between Argentina and Nigeria, based not on geographical proximity, long-term battles for honours or factors outside football, but due to the frequency of significant matches between them. This has included five World Cup group matches, all won by Argentina by a single goal margin: 2–1 in 1994, 1–0 in 2002, 1–0 in 2010, 3–2 in 2014 and 2–1 in 2018. The fixture is the most common in the competition&#x27;s history involving an African nation, and has occurred in five of the six tournaments for which Nigeria has qualified. The sides also met in the 1995 King Fahd Cup (the predecessor to the Confederations Cup) as champions of their respective continents, drawing 0–0.

Below full international level, their Olympic teams also faced off in the gold medal match in 1996 (3–2 to Nigeria), and 2008 (1–0 to Argentina). The final of the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship was also played between them; both Argentina goals in their 2–1 win were scored by Lionel Messi, who would go on to find the net for the senior team in the 2014 and 2018 World Cup fixtures.

The sense of rivalry is more keenly felt on the Nigerian side, as Argentina has won almost all of their encounters, so they do not consider Nigeria a rival like Brazil, England, Uruguay or Germany, in contrast to the West Africans who remain keen to finally overcome a more illustrious foe.

=== Uruguay ===

Argentina has a long-standing rivalry with its neighbour, that came into existence from the early South American Championships, the 1928 Summer Olympics and the first World Cup final, held in 1930.

Argentina and Uruguay hold the record for most international matches played between two countries. The two teams have faced each other 197 times since 1902. The first match between Argentina and Uruguay was also the first official international match to be played outside the United Kingdom.

<text>Roxborough is a neighborhood in Northwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It is bordered to the southwest, along the Schuylkill River, by the neighborhood of Manayunk, along the northeast by the Wissahickon Creek section of Fairmount Park, and to the southeast by the neighborhood of East Falls. Beyond Roxborough to the northwest is Montgomery County. Roxborough&#x27;s ZIP Code is 19128. Most of Roxborough is in Philadelphia&#x27;s 21st Ward.

==History==

The Native American trail called the Manatawny, now Ridge Avenue, was central to the well-organized development of farms and plantations within the area then known as Manatawna. The Court of Upland in England appointed local Swedish settler Peter Rambo to be the maintainer of the Manatawny road. In 1690, the road was renamed Ridge Road (it follows the crest of the ridge between the Wissahickon valley and the Schuylkill valley), and the area was renamed Roxburgh, likely named for Roxburghshire, Scotland, the ancestral home of Andrew Robeson, one of the earliest settlers of the area. By 1707, the name had been changed to Roxborough. Roxborough is first mentioned as a township in QS Road Docket II: 31 in 1706. In 1840, Manayunk was erected as a borough within the township, and on March 31, 1847, Manayunk was declared separate from the township.

Most of modern-day Roxborough was once part of Roxborough Township, which was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation, 1854. At this time, Roxborough was the home of the area&#x27;s wealthiest, the owners of the Manayunk mills. These textile mills produced revenue that was spent building schools, parks, and a large Victorian manor built for the area&#x27;s elderly women, The Roxborough Home for Women.
Since the 1950s, most of Philadelphia&#x27;s major television and FM radio stations have located their transmission towers in Roxborough because of its hilly terrain and high elevation. The tallest of these towers, the American Tower, stands approximately 1,250 feet (381m) tall. Public television station , once called &quot;WYBE&quot;, was also formerly located in Upper Roxborough, close to neighboring Andorra.

The Upper Roxborough Historic District and William Levering School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Roxborough is well-connected to Center City Philadelphia with multiple bus routes and bike lanes reaching the river and downtown area of Philadelphia. SEPTA&#x27;s Manayunk/Norristown Regional Rail line stops in the Wissahickon section of Roxborough, continues through Manayunk, and stops again at the Ivy Ridge station in Roxborough.

Philadelphia University and St. Joseph&#x27;s University are nearby.

Henry Avenue runs parallel to Ridge Avenue from the border of East Falls and North Philadelphia to Andorra, where it merges into Ridge Avenue. Constructed in the 1930s, it was extended in 1959 from Roxborough Avenue to Andorra, and includes several concrete arch bridges. One of these bridges, the Wissahickon Memorial Bridge, which crosses over the Wissahickon Creek and Lincoln Drive, includes a pair of box tunnels under the roadway designed to carry a never built extension of the Broad Street Subway into Roxborough.

Because of the Wissahickon Creek and the park that protects much of its watershed, Roxborough and Manayunk are physically separated from the rest of the city. Much of lower Roxborough, consisting of &quot;row homes&quot; and homes dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries, has a historic, urban character.

Roxborough abuts the Wissahickon Valley Park portion of the Fairmount Park system. The park&#x27;s numerous trails are used by cyclists, runners, walkers, dog owners, and mountain bikers.

The northwest section of Roxborough is often considered a separate neighborhood called Upper Roxborough. Much of the development in this area occurred after 1950, and has a suburban character: larger front lawns, garages, and shopping centers.

==Etymology==

===Andrew Robeson and Roxburgh, Scotland===
The area of Roxborough was likely named for Roxburghshire, Scotland, the original home of Andrew Robeson, one of the first settlers of the area.

In 1676, Andrew Robeson, his wife Elizabeth, and his nephew Andrew Jr. came to America from Scotland, where Andrew Sr. became Surveyor General for 300,000 acres of land in southern New Jersey, where he presided as Judge in Gloucester County. In 1690, Andrew Sr. moved to Philadelphia and purchased an estate located in the area that is known today as Roxborough, roughly where the on and off ramps for City Line Avenue and Lincoln Drive are.

Andrew Jr. became Chief of Justice in Pennsylvania from 1693 until 1699. He was responsible for making Roxborough a township in 1690.

The Robeson family is known to have originally come from Kelso, Roxburghshire, Scotland. Roxburgh (pronounced Rocs-burr-ah) was a small region in the southeast of Scotland until it was changed to the region of &quot;The Borders&quot; in 1975; the town of Kelso still remains as a historic Scottish village.

===Rocksburrow===
In 1706, a German philosopher named Johannes Kelpius, who lived in the woods not far from the Robesons, wrote about &quot;foxes burrowing in rocks&quot; in the area. A correlation between the phonetic spelling &quot;Rocksburrow&quot; that many resident Germans applied to the Township, and Kelpius&#x27;s &quot;where foxes burrow&quot; letter of 1706, convinced many that the township&#x27;s origins related to foxes.

Kelpius popularized his spelling of the township, but not long afterward the spelling was changed to its current form.

The Township could have retained the names &quot;Manatawna&quot; or &quot;Leverington&quot;, as they were popular names the area was referred to as in the 1690s and early 1700s, but thanks to the popular writings of Johannes Kelpius, the name remained as Roxborough. Other spellings have also been noted in early writings as Roxbury and Roxboro.

==Education==
=== Primary and secondary schools ===
The School District of Philadelphia operates public schools. Its zoned schools include Shawmont Elementary, Cook Wissahickon, and Roxborough High School.

The Walter Biddle Saul High School of Agricultural Sciences and Lankenau Environmental Magnet High School are in upper Roxborough.

William Levering School, founded in 1748, closed its doors in June 2012. The Academy for the Middle Years (AMY) Northwest Middle School, a special admissions middle school (6–8), now occupies the building. AMY used to be located in the Mount Airy section of Philadelphia, in a rented church building.

The area has been one of the main feeder regions for Roman Catholic and J.W. Hallahan High Schools.

=== Public libraries ===
The Free Library of Philadelphia operates the Roxborough Branch at 6245 Ridge Avenue at Hermitage Street. The &quot;Roxborough - Manayunk - Wissahickon - East Falls - Andorra Historical Society&quot; also has an archive room in the Roxborough Branch. It is maintained by one of the Historical Societies&#x27; top members and one of the area&#x27;s community leaders, Sylvia Myers.

== Transportation ==

One of the main and oldest thoroughfares through Roxborough is Ridge Avenue. Previously a Native American trail called the Manatawny, by the 18th century the trail was known as &quot;Ridge Road,&quot; and by the 1730s, Ridge Road was popularized as “The Great Road from Philadelphia to Reading.” Passenger stagecoaches frequently traveled on the road, and many inns were built along it. Ridge Road even played a part during the American Revolution as various sections of the road were travelled by soldiers in 1777 during the lead-up to the Battle of Germantown.

The other main thoroughfare through Roxborough is Henry Avenue, which was laid out in the late 1950s as a four-lane road running the length of the neighborhood and parallel to Ridge Avenue.

One SEPTA Regional Rail line connects the neighborhood to Center City: the Manayunk/Norristown Line stops at the Ivy Ridge station, Manayunk station, and Wissahickon station. SEPTA closed the historic Shawmont station in 1996.

The neighborhood is also served by SEPTA bus routes 1, 9, 27, 32, 35, and 65.
