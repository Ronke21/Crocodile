<text>A kiln is a thermally insulated chamber, a type of oven, that produces temperatures sufficient to complete some process, such as hardening, drying, or chemical changes. Kilns have been used for millennia to turn objects made from clay into pottery, tiles and bricks. Various industries use rotary kilns for pyroprocessing (to calcinate ores, such as limestone to lime for cement) and to transform many other materials.

==Etymology==
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, kiln was derived from the words cyline, cylene, cyln(e) in Old English, in turn derived from Latin &quot;culina&quot; (&#x27;kitchen&#x27;). In Middle English, the word is attested as kulne, kyllne, kilne, kiln, kylle, kyll, kil, kill, keele, kiele. In Greek the word &quot;καίειν, kaiein&quot;, means &#x27;to burn&#x27;.

== Pronunciation ==
The word &#x27;kiln&#x27; was originally pronounced &#x27;kil&#x27; with the &#x27;n&#x27; silent, as is referenced in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of 1828&quot; and in &quot;English Words as Spoken and Written for Upper Grades&quot; by James A. Bowen 1900: &quot;The digraph ln, n silent, occurs in kiln. A fall down the kiln can kill you.&quot; Bowen was noting that &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;kiln&quot; are homophones.

== Uses of kilns ==
Pit fired pottery was produced for thousands of years before the earliest known kiln, which dates to around 6000 BCE, and was found at the Yarim Tepe site in modern Iraq. Neolithic kilns were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 °C (1652 °F).

*For cremation (at high temperature)
*Drying of tobacco leaves
*Drying malted barley for brewing and other fermentations
*Drying hops for brewing (known as a hop kiln or oast house)
*Drying corn (grain) before grinding or storage, sometimes called a corn kiln, corn drying kiln
*Drying green lumber so it can be used immediately
*Drying wood for use as firewood
*Heating wood to the point of pyrolysis to produce charcoal
*Extracting pine tar from pine tree logs or roots

== Ceramic kilns ==
Kilns are an essential part of the manufacture of almost all types of ceramics. Ceramics require high temperatures so chemical and physical reactions will occur to permanently alter the unfired body. In the case of pottery, clay materials are shaped, dried and then fired in a kiln. The final characteristics are determined by the composition and preparation of the clay body and the temperature at which it is fired. After a first firing, glazes may be used and the ware is fired a second time to fuse the glaze into the body. A third firing at a lower temperature may be required to fix overglaze decoration. Modern kilns often have sophisticated electronic control systems, although pyrometric devices are often also used.

Clay consists of fine-grained particles that are relatively weak and porous. Clay is combined with other minerals to create a workable clay body. The firing process includes sintering. This heats the clay until the particles partially melt and flow together, creating a strong, single mass, composed of a glassy phase interspersed with pores and crystalline material. Through firing, the pores are reduced in size, causing the material to shrink slightly.

In the broadest terms, there are two types of kilns: intermittent and continuous, both being an insulated box with a controlled inner temperature and atmosphere.

A continuous kiln, sometimes called a tunnel kiln, is long with only the central portion directly heated. From the cool entrance, ware is slowly moved through the kiln, and its temperature is increased steadily as it approaches the central, hottest part of the kiln. As it continues through the kiln, the temperature is reduced until the ware exits the kiln nearly at room temperature. A continuous kiln is energy-efficient, because heat given off during cooling is recycled to pre-heat the incoming ware. In some designs, the ware is left in one place, while the heating zone moves across it. Kilns in this type include:
*Hoffmann kiln
*Bull&#x27;s Trench kiln
*Habla (Zig-Zag) kiln
*Roller kiln: A special type of kiln, common in tableware and tile manufacture, is the &quot;roller-hearth kiln&quot;, in which wares placed on bats are carried through the kiln on rollers.

In the intermittent kiln, the ware is placed inside the kiln, the kiln is closed, and the internal temperature is increased according to a schedule. After the firing is completed, both the kiln and the ware are cooled. The ware is removed, the kiln is cleaned and the next cycle begins. Kilns in this type include:
*Clamp kiln
*Skove kiln
*Scotch kiln
*Down-draft kiln
*Shuttle kilns: this is a car-bottom kiln with a door on one or both ends. Burners are positioned top and bottom on each side, creating a turbulent circular air flow. This type of kiln is generally a multi-car design and is used for processing whitewares, technical ceramics and refractories in batches. Depending upon the size of ware, shuttle kilns may be equipped with car-moving devices to transfer fired and unfired ware in and out of the kiln. Shuttle kilns can be either updraft or downdraft. A shuttle kiln derives its name from the fact that kiln cars can enter a shuttle kiln from either end of the kiln, whereas a tunnel kiln has flow in only one direction.

Kiln technology is very old. Kilns developed from a simple earthen trench filled with pots and fuel pit firing, to modern methods. One improvement was to build a firing chamber around pots with baffles and a stoking hole. This conserved heat. A chimney stack improved the air flow or &quot;draw&quot; of the kiln, thus burning the fuel more completely.

Chinese kiln technology has always been a key factor in the development of Chinese pottery, and until recent centuries was the most advanced in the world. The Chinese developed kilns capable of firing at around 1,000 °C before 2000 BCE. These were updraft kilns, often built below ground. Two main types of kiln were developed by about 200 AD and remained in use until modern times. These are the dragon kiln of hilly southern China, usually fuelled by wood, long and thin and running up a slope, and the horseshoe-shaped mantou kiln of the north Chinese plains, smaller and more compact. Both could reliably produce the temperatures of up to 1300 °C or more needed for porcelain. In the late Ming, the egg-shaped kiln or &quot;zhenyao&quot; was developed at Jingdezhen and mainly used there. This was something of a compromise between the other types, and offered locations in the firing chamber with a range of firing conditions.

Both Ancient Roman pottery and medieval Chinese pottery could be fired in industrial quantities, with tens of thousands of pieces in a single firing. Early examples of simpler kilns found in Britain include those that made roof-tiles during the Roman occupation. These kilns were built up the side of a slope, such that a fire could be lit at the bottom and the heat would rise up into the kiln.

Traditional kilns include:
*Dragon kiln of south China: thin and long, climbing up a hillside. This type spread to the rest of East Asia giving the Japanese anagama kiln, arriving via Korea in the 5th century. This kiln usually consists of one long firing chamber, pierced with smaller ware stacking ports on one side, with a firebox at one end and a flue at the other. Firing time can vary from one day to several weeks. Traditional anagama kilns are also built on a slope to allow for a better draft. The Japanese noborigama kiln is an evolution from anagama design as a multi-chamber kiln where wood is stacked from the front firebox at first, then only through the side-stoking holes with the benefit of having air heated up to from the front firebox, enabling more efficient firings.

*Khmer Kiln: quite similar to the anagama kiln; however, traditional Khmer Kilns had a flat roof. Chinese, Korean or Japanese kilns have an arch roof. These types of kiln vary in size and can measure in the tens of meters. The firing time also varies and can last several days.
*Bottle kiln: a type of intermittent kiln, usually coal-fired, formerly used in the firing of pottery; such a kiln was surrounded by a tall brick hovel or cone, of typical bottle shape. The tableware was enclosed in sealed fireclay saggars; as the heat and smoke from the fires passed through the oven it would be fired at temperatures up to .
*Biscuit kiln: The first firing would take place in the biscuit kiln.
*Glost kiln: The biscuit-ware was glazed and given a second glost firing in glost kilns.
*Mantou kiln of north China, smaller and more compact than the dragon kiln 
*Muffle kiln: This was used to fire over-glaze decoration, at a temperature under . In these cool kilns the smoke from the fires passed through flues outside the oven.
*Catenary arch kiln: Typically used for the firing of pottery using salt, these by their form (a catenary arch) tend to retain their shape over repeated heating and cooling cycles, whereas other types require extensive metalwork supports.
*Sèvres kiln: invented in Sèvres, France, it efficiently generated high-temperatures to produce waterproof ceramic bodies and easy-to-obtain glazes. It features a down-draft design that produces high temperature in shorter time, even with wood-firing.
*Bourry box kiln, similar to previous one

=== Modern kilns ===

With the industrial age, kilns were designed to use electricity and more refined fuels, including natural gas and propane. Many large industrial pottery kilns use natural gas, as it is generally clean, efficient and easy to control. Modern kilns can be fitted with computerized controls allowing for fine adjustments during the firing. A user may choose to control the rate of temperature climb or &quot;ramp&quot;, &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;soak&quot; the temperature at any given point, or control the rate of cooling. Both electric and gas kilns are common for smaller scale production in industry and craft, handmade and sculptural work.

Modern kilns include:
*Retort kiln: a type of kiln which can reach temperatures around for extended periods of time. Typically, these kilns are used in industrial purposes, and feature movable charging cars which make up the bottom and door of the kiln.
*Electric kilns: kilns operated by electricity were developed in the 20th century, primarily for smaller scale use such as in schools, universities, and hobby centers. The atmosphere in most designs of electric kiln is rich in oxygen, as there is no open flame to consume oxygen molecules. However, reducing conditions can be created with appropriate gas input, or by using saggars in a particular way.
*Feller kiln: brought contemporary design to wood firing by re-using unburnt gas from the chimney to heat intake air before it enters the firebox. This leads to an even shorter firing cycle and less wood consumption. This design requires external ventilation to prevent the in-chimney radiator from melting, being typically in metal. The result is a very efficient wood kiln firing one cubic metre of ceramics with one cubic meter of wood.
*Microwave assisted firing: this technique combines microwave energy with more conventional energy sources, such as radiant gas or electric heating, to process ceramic materials to the required high temperatures. Microwave-assisted firing offers significant economic benefits.
*Microwave kiln: These small kilns are designed to be placed inside a standard microwave oven. The kiln body is made from a porous ceramic material lined with a coating that absorbs microwave energy. The microwave kiln is placed inside a microwave oven and heated to the desired temperature. The heating process is much less controlled than most modern electric kilns, as there is no built-in temperature monitoring. The user must monitor the process closely to achieve the desired results, adjusting time and power levels programmed on the microwave oven. A small hole in the lid of the kiln can be used to estimate the interior temperature visually, as hot materials will glow. Microwave kilns are designed to reach internal temperatures of over , hot enough to work some types of glass, metals, and ceramics, while the outside of the kiln remains cool enough to handle with hot pads or tongs. After firing, the kiln should be removed from the microwave oven and placed on heat-proof surface while it is allowed to cool. Microwave kilns are limited in size, usually no more than in diameter.
*Top-hat kiln: an intermittent kiln of a type sometimes used to fire pottery. The ware is set on a refractory hearth, or plinth, over which a box-shaped cover is lowered.

== Wood-drying kiln ==
Green wood coming straight from the felled tree has far too high a moisture content to be commercially useful and will rot, warp and split. Both hardwoods and softwood must be left to dry out until the moisture content is between 18% and 8%. This can be a long process unless accelerated by use of a kiln. A variety of kiln technologies exist today: conventional, dehumidification, solar, vacuum and radio frequency.

Conventional wood dry kilns are either package-type (side-loader) or track-type (tram) construction. Most hardwood lumber kilns are side-loader kilns in which fork trucks are used to load lumber packages into the kiln. Most softwood kilns are track types in which the timber is loaded on kiln/track cars for loading the kiln. Modern high-temperature, high-air-velocity conventional kilns can typically dry green wood in 10 hours down to a moisture content of 18%. However, 25-mm-thick green red oak requires about 28 days to dry down to a moisture content of 8%.

Heat is typically introduced via steam running through fin/tube heat exchangers controlled by on/off pneumatic valves. Humidity is removed by a system of vents, the specific layout of which are usually particular to a given manufacturer. In general, cool dry air is introduced at one end of the kiln while warm moist air is expelled at the other. Hardwood conventional kilns also require the introduction of humidity via either steam spray or cold water misting systems to keep the relative humidity inside the kiln from dropping too low during the drying cycle. Fan directions are typically reversed periodically to ensure even drying of larger kiln charges.

Most softwood kilns operate below temperature. Hardwood kiln drying schedules typically keep the dry bulb temperature below . Difficult-to-dry species might not exceed .

Dehumidification kilns are similar to other kilns in basic construction and drying times are usually comparable. Heat comes primarily from an integral dehumidification unit that also removes humidity. Auxiliary heat is often provided early in the schedule to supplement the dehumidifier.

 are conventional kilns, typically built by hobbyists to keep initial investment costs low. Heat is provided via solar radiation, while internal air circulation is typically passive.

Vacuum and radio frequency kilns reduce the air pressure to attempt to speed up the drying process. A variety of these vacuum technologies exist, varying primarily in the method heat is introduced into the wood charge. Hot water platten vacuum kilns use aluminum heating plates with the water circulating within as the heat source, and typically operate at significantly reduced absolute pressure. Discontinuous and SSV (super-heated steam) use atmosphere pressure to introduce heat into the kiln charge. The entire kiln charge comes up to full atmospheric pressure, the air in the chamber is then heated and finally a vacuum is pulled as the charge cools. SSV run at partial-atmospheres, typically around 1/3 of full atmospheric pressure, in a hybrid of vacuum and conventional kiln technology (SSV kilns are significantly more popular in Europe where the locally harvested wood is easier to dry than the North American woods.) RF/V (radio frequency + vacuum) kilns use microwave radiation to heat the kiln charge, and typically have the highest operating cost due to the heat of vaporization being provided by electricity rather than local fossil fuel or waste wood sources.

The economics of different wood drying technologies are based on the total energy, capital, insurance/risk, environmental impacts, labor, maintenance, and product degradation costs. These costs, which can be a significant part of plant costs, involve the differential impact of the presence of drying equipment in a specific plant. Every piece of equipment from the green trimmer to the infeed system at the planer mill is part of the &quot;drying system&quot;. The true costs of the drying system can only be determined when comparing the total plant costs and risks with and without drying.

Kiln dried firewood was pioneered during the 1980s, and was later adopted extensively in Europe due to the economic and practical benefits of selling wood with a lower moisture content (with optimal moisture levels of under 20% being much easier to achieve).

The total (harmful) air emissions produced by wood kilns, including their heat source, can be significant. Typically, the higher the temperature at which the kiln operates, the larger the quantity of emissions that are produced (per mass unit of water removed). This is especially true in the drying of thin veneers and high-temperature drying of softwoods.

<text>Kiwi ( ) are flightless birds endemic to New Zealand of the order Apterygiformes. The five extant species fall into the family Apterygidae () and genus Apteryx (). Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are the smallest ratites (which also include ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries and the extinct elephant birds and moa).

DNA sequence comparisons have yielded the conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy elephant birds than to the moa with which they shared New Zealand. There are five recognised species, four of which are currently listed as vulnerable, and one of which is near threatened. All species have been negatively affected by historic deforestation, but their remaining habitat is well protected in large forest reserves and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators.

The vestigial wings are so small as to be invisible under their bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. Kiwi eggs are one of the largest in proportion to body size (up to 20% of the female&#x27;s weight) of any order of bird in the world. Other unique adaptations of kiwi, such as short and stout legs and using their nostrils at the end of their long beak to detect prey before they see it, have helped the bird to become internationally well known.

The kiwi is recognised as an icon of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term &quot;Kiwi&quot; is used internationally as the colloquial demonym for New Zealanders.

==Etymology==

The Māori language word is generally accepted to be &quot;of imitative origin&quot; from the call. However, some linguists derive the word from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian , which refers to &quot;Numenius tahitiensis&quot;, the bristle-thighed curlew, a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific islands. With its long decurved bill and brown body, the curlew resembles the kiwi. So when the first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the newfound bird. The bird&#x27;s name is spelled with a lower-case &quot;k&quot; and, being a word of Māori origin, normally stays as &quot;kiwi&quot; when pluralised. 

The genus name &quot;Apteryx&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &#x27;without wing&#x27;: (), &#x27;without&#x27; or &#x27;not&#x27;; (), &#x27;wing&#x27;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Although it was long presumed that the kiwi was closely related to the other New Zealand ratites, the moa, recent DNA studies have identified its closest relative as the extinct elephant bird of Madagascar, and among extant ratites, the kiwi is more closely related to the emu and the cassowaries than to the moa.

Research published in 2013 on an extinct genus, &quot;Proapteryx&quot;, known from the Miocene deposits of the Saint Bathans Fauna, found that it was smaller and probably capable of flight, supporting the hypothesis that the ancestor of the kiwi reached New Zealand independently from moas, which were already large and flightless by the time kiwi appeared.

===Species===
There are five known species of kiwi, with a number of subspecies.

==Description==

Their adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive: like all the other ratites (ostrich, emu, rhea and cassowary), they have no keel on the sternum to anchor wing muscles. The vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, like mammals and the young of other birds. With no constraints on weight due to flight requirements, brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as . Like most other ratites, they have no uropygial gland (preen gland). Their bill is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, and their eyes have a reduced pecten. Their feathers lack barbules and , and they have large vibrissae around the gape. They have 13 flight feathers, no tail and a small pygostyle. Their gizzard is weak and their caecum is long and narrow.

The eye of the kiwi is the smallest relative to body mass in all avian species, resulting in the smallest visual field as well. The eye has small specialisations for a nocturnal lifestyle, but kiwi rely more heavily on their other senses (auditory, olfactory, and somatosensory system). The sight of the kiwi is so underdeveloped that blind specimens have been observed in nature, showing how little they rely on sight for survival and foraging. In an experiment, it was observed that one-third of a population of &quot;A. rowi&quot; in New Zealand under no environmental stress had ocular lesions in one or both eyes. The same experiment examined three specific specimens that showed complete blindness and found them to be in good physical standing outside of ocular abnormalities. A 2018 study revealed that the kiwi&#x27;s closest relatives, the extinct elephant birds, also shared this trait despite their great size.

Unlike virtually every other palaeognath, which are generally small-brained by bird standards, kiwi have proportionally large encephalisation quotients. Hemisphere proportions are even similar to those of parrots and songbirds, though there is no evidence of similarly complex behaviour.
==Behaviour and ecology==

Before the arrival of humans in the 13th century or earlier, New Zealand&#x27;s only endemic mammals were three species of bat, and the ecological niches that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses, wolves and mice were taken up by birds (and, to a lesser extent, reptiles, insects and gastropods).

The kiwi&#x27;s mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains. Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them. This sense of smell is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions. It is a common belief that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey but this has not been scientifically observed. Lab experiments have suggested that &quot;A. australis&quot; can rely on olfaction alone but is not consistent under natural conditions. Instead, the kiwi may rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile cues.

Once bonded, a male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These relationships may last for up to 20 years. They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.) 

Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter the weight of the female. Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays one of the largest eggs in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, so even though the kiwi is about the size of a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken&#x27;s egg. The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, &quot;A. haastii&quot;, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92 days. Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.

It was believed that the large eggs were a trait of much larger moa-like ancestors, and that kiwi retained large eggs as an evolutionarily neutral trait as they became smaller. However, research in the early 2010s suggested that kiwi were descended from smaller flighted birds that flew to New Zealand and Madagascar, where they gave rise to kiwi and elephant birds. The large egg is instead thought to be an adaptation for precocity, enabling kiwi chicks to hatch mobile and with yolk to sustain them for two and half weeks. The large eggs would be safe in New Zealand&#x27;s historical absence of egg-eating ground predators, while the mobile chicks would be able to evade chick-eating flying predators.

Lice in the genus &quot;Apterygon&quot; and in the subgenus &quot;Rallicola&quot; (&quot;Aptericola&quot;) are exclusively ectoparasites of kiwi species.

==Status and conservation==

Nationwide studies show that only around 5–10% of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood without management. over 70% of kiwi populations are unmanaged. However, in areas under active pest management, survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher. For example, prior to a joint 1080 poison operation undertaken by DOC and the Animal Health Board in Tongariro Forest in 2006, 32 kiwi chicks were radio-tagged. 57% of the radio-tagged chicks survived to adulthood.

Efforts to protect kiwi have had some success, and in 2017 two species were downlisted from endangered to vulnerable by the IUCN. In 2018 the Department of Conservation released its current Kiwi Conservation Plan.

===Sanctuaries===
In 2000, the Department of Conservation set up five kiwi sanctuaries focused on developing methods to protect kiwi and to increase their numbers.
:There are three kiwi sanctuaries in the North Island:
:*Whangarei Kiwi Sanctuary (for Northland brown kiwi)
:*Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary on the Coromandel Peninsula (Coromandel brown kiwi)
:*Tongariro Kiwi Sanctuary near Taupō (western brown kiwi)
:and two in the South Island:
:*Okarito Kiwi Sanctuary (Okarito kiwi)
:*Haast Kiwi Sanctuary (Haast tokoeka)

A number of other mainland conservation islands and fenced sanctuaries have significant populations of kiwi, including:
* Zealandia fenced sanctuary in Wellington (little spotted kiwi)
* Maungatautari Restoration Project in Waikato (brown kiwi)
* Bushy Park Forest Reserve near Kai Iwi, Whanganui (brown kiwi)
* Otanewainuku Forest in the Bay of Plenty Region (brown kiwi)
* Hurunui Mainland Island, south branch, Hurunui River, North Canterbury (great spotted kiwi)

North Island brown kiwi were introduced to the Cape Sanctuary in Hawke&#x27;s Bay between 2008 and 2011, which in turn provided captive-raised chicks that were released back into Maungataniwha Native Forest.

Sanctuaries for kiwi are also referred to as &#x27;kōhanga sites&#x27; from the Māori word for &#x27;nest&#x27; or &#x27;nursery&#x27;.
===Operation Nest Egg===
Operation Nest Egg is a programme run by the BNZ Save the Kiwi Trust—a partnership between the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and/or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselves—usually when they weigh around 1200 grams (42 ounces). They are then returned to the wild. An Operation Nest Egg bird has a 65% chance of surviving to adulthood—compared to just 5% for wild-hatched and -raised chicks. The tool is used on all kiwi species except little spotted kiwi.

===1080 poison===
In 2004, anti-1080 activist Phillip Anderton posed for the New Zealand media with a kiwi he claimed had been poisoned. An investigation revealed that Anderton lied to journalists and the public. He had used a kiwi that had been caught in a possum trap. Extensive monitoring shows that kiwi are not at risk from the use of biodegradable 1080 poison.

===Threats===
Introduced mammalian predators, namely stoats, dogs, ferrets, and cats, are the principal threats to kiwi. The biggest threat to kiwi chicks is stoats, while dogs are the biggest threat to adult kiwi. Stoats are responsible for approximately half of kiwi chick deaths in many areas through New Zealand. Young kiwi chicks are vulnerable to stoat predation until they reach about in weight, at which time they can usually defend themselves. Cats also to a lesser extent prey on kiwi chicks. These predators can cause large and abrupt declines in populations. In particular, dogs find the distinctive strong scent of kiwi irresistible and easy to track, such that they can catch and kill kiwi in seconds. Motor vehicle strike is a threat to all kiwi where roads cross through their habitat. Badly set possum traps often kill or maim kiwi.

Habitat destruction is another major threat to kiwi; restricted distribution and small size of some kiwi populations increases their vulnerability to inbreeding. Research has shown that the combined effect of predators and other mortality (accidents, etc.) results in less than 5% of kiwi chicks surviving to adulthood.

==Relationship to humans==
The Māori traditionally believed that kiwi were under the protection of Tāne Mahuta, god of the forest. They were used as food and their feathers were used for kahu kiwi—ceremonial cloaks. Today, while kiwi feathers are still used, they are gathered from birds that die naturally, through road accidents, or predation, and from captive birds. Kiwi are no longer hunted and some Māori consider themselves the birds&#x27; guardians.

===Scientific documentation===
In 1813, George Shaw named the genus &quot;Apteryx&quot; in his species description of the southern brown kiwi, which he called &quot;the southern apteryx&quot;. Captain Andrew Barclay of the ship &quot;Providence&quot; provided Shaw with the specimen. Shaw&#x27;s description was accompanied by two plates, engraved by Frederick Polydore Nodder; they were published in volume 24 of &quot;The Naturalist&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;.

===Zoos===
In 1851, London Zoo became the first zoo to keep kiwi. The first captive breeding took place in 1945. As of 2007 only 13 zoos outside New Zealand hold kiwi. The Frankfurt Zoo has 12, the Berlin Zoo has seven, Walsrode Bird Park has one, the Avifauna Bird Park in the Netherlands has three, the San Diego Zoo has five, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park has one, the National Zoo in Washington, DC has eleven, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has one, and the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has three.

In 2023, Zoo Miami apologized for mistreating a kiwi, after footage of visitors patting the nocturnal bird under bright lights caused outrage in New Zealand.

===As a national symbol===

The kiwi as a symbol first appeared in the late 19th century in New Zealand regimental badges. It was later featured in the badges of the South Canterbury Battalion in 1886 and the Hastings Rifle Volunteers in 1887. Soon after, the kiwi appeared in many military badges; and in 1906, when Kiwi Shoe Polish was widely sold in the UK and the US, the symbol became more widely known.

During the First World War, the name &quot;Kiwis&quot; for New Zealand soldiers came into general use, and a giant kiwi (now known as the Bulford kiwi) was carved on the chalk hill above Sling Camp in England. Usage has become so widespread that all New Zealanders overseas and at home are now commonly referred to as &quot;Kiwis&quot;.

The kiwi has since become the best-known national symbol for New Zealand, and the bird is prominent in the coat of arms, crests and badges of many New Zealand cities, clubs and organisations. At the national level, the red silhouette of a kiwi is in the centre of the roundel of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The kiwi is featured in the logo of the New Zealand Rugby League, and the New Zealand national rugby league team are nicknamed the Kiwis.

A kiwi has featured on the reverse side of three New Zealand coins: the one florin (two-shilling) coin from 1933 to 1966, the twenty-cent coin from 1967 to 1990, and the one-dollar coin since 1991. In currency trading the New Zealand dollar is often referred to as &quot;the kiwi&quot;.

===In popular culture===

A song, &quot;Sticky Beak the Kiwi&quot;, with words by Bob Edwards and music by Neil Roberts, was recorded in 1961, sung by Julie Nelson (aged 14) and accompanied by the Satins and the Don Bell Orchestra of Whangārei. A Christmas song, it portrays Sticky Beak as insisting on pulling Santa Claus&#x27;s sleigh when distributing presents south of the equator. 

&quot;How the Kiwi Lost its Wings&quot; is a fable written by broadcaster Alwyn Owen in 1963. It uses elements of Māori mythology, such as Tāne Mahuta, and the World War I symbol of cowardice, white feathers, in a pourquoi story explaining features of New Zealand birds. Owen portrays the kiwi as nobly sacrificing its wings and flight in order to protect the trees from depredation by ground-dwelling creatures, and thereby winning its unique renown. Owen&#x27;s story is sometimes described as &quot;A Maori Legend&quot;. It has been recorded as a children&#x27;s story, published as a book, was made into an animated film in 1980, set to music for the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra by Thomas Goss as &quot;Tāne and the Kiwi&quot; in 2002 (recorded for RNZ by Orchestra Wellington in 2008), and performed as a ballet by the Royal New Zealand Ballet in 2022.

<text>Kiwifruit (often shortened to kiwi outside Australia and New Zealand), or Chinese gooseberry, is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus &quot;Actinidia&quot;. The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (&quot;Actinidia deliciosa&quot; &#x27;Hayward&#x27;) is oval, about the size of a large hen&#x27;s egg: in length and in diameter. Kiwifruit has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible, light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour. 

Kiwifruit is native to central and eastern China. The first recorded description of the kiwifruit dates to the 12th century during the Song dynasty. In the early 20th century, cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred. The fruit became popular with British and American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II. It later became commonly exported, first to Great Britain and then to California in the 1960s.

==Etymology==
Early varieties were discovered and cultivated in China. They were described in a 1904 nursery catalogue as having &quot;...edible fruits the size of walnuts, and the flavour of ripe gooseberries&quot;, leading to the name, &quot;Chinese gooseberry&quot;.

In the late 1950s, a major New Zealand exporter began calling it &quot;kiwifruit&quot; () after being advised by a United States client that quarantine officials might mistakenly associate the unpopular name &quot;gooseberries&quot; – which grow close to the ground – with suspicion of anthrax. The name &quot;kiwifruit&quot; was adopted for the furry, brown fruit in relation to New Zealand&#x27;s furry, brown, national bird – the kiwi. The name was first registered by Turners &amp; Growers on 15 June 1959, and commercially adopted in 1974.

In New Zealand and Australia, the word &quot;kiwi&quot; alone either refers to the bird or is used as a nickname for New Zealanders; it is rarely used to refer to the fruit. Kiwifruit has since become a common name for all commercially grown green kiwifruit from the genus &quot;Actinidia&quot;. In the United States and Canada, the shortened name &quot;kiwi&quot; is commonly used when referring to the fruit.

==History==

Kiwifruit is native to central and eastern China. The first recorded description of the kiwifruit dates to 12th century China during the Song dynasty. As it was usually collected from the wild and consumed for medicinal purposes, the plant was rarely cultivated or bred. Cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China in the early 20th century to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred. After the Hayward variety was developed, the fruit became popular with British and American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II. Kiwifruits were exported to Great Britain and then to California in the 1960s.

In New Zealand during the 1940s and 1950s, the fruit became an agricultural commodity through the development of commercially viable cultivars, agricultural practices, shipping, storage, and marketing.

==Species and cultivars==

The genus &quot;Actinidia&quot; comprises around 60 species. Their fruits are quite variable, although most are easily recognised as kiwifruit because of their appearance and shape. The skin of the fruit varies in size, hairiness, and colour. The flesh varies in colour, juiciness, texture, and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable, while others taste considerably better than most commercial cultivars.

The most commonly sold kiwifruit is derived from &quot;A. deliciosa&quot; (fuzzy kiwifruit). Other species that are commonly eaten include &quot;A. chinensis&quot; (golden kiwifruit), &quot;A. coriacea&quot; (Chinese egg gooseberry), &quot;A. arguta&quot; (hardy kiwifruit), &quot;A. kolomikta&quot; (Arctic kiwifruit), &quot;A. melanandra&quot; (purple kiwifruit), &quot;A. polygama&quot; (silver vine) and &quot;A. purpurea&quot; (hearty red kiwifruit).

===Fuzzy kiwifruit===

Most kiwifruit sold belongs to a few cultivars of &quot;A. deliciosa&quot; (fuzzy kiwifruit): &#x27;Hayward&#x27;, &#x27;Blake&#x27; and &#x27;Saanichton 12&#x27;. They have a fuzzy, dull brown skin and bright green flesh. The familiar cultivar &#x27;Hayward&#x27; was developed by Hayward Wright in Avondale, New Zealand, around 1924. It was initially grown in domestic gardens, but commercial planting began in the 1940s.

&#x27;Hayward&#x27; is the most commonly available cultivar in stores. It is a large, egg-shaped fruit with a sweet flavour. &#x27;Saanichton 12&#x27;, from British Columbia, is somewhat more rectangular than &#x27;Hayward&#x27; and comparably sweet, but the inner core of the fruit can be tough. &#x27;Blake&#x27; can self-pollinate, but has a smaller, more oval fruit, and the flavour is considered inferior.

===Kiwi berries===
Kiwi berries are edible fruits the size of a large grape, similar to fuzzy kiwifruit in taste and internal appearance but with a thin, smooth green skin. They are primarily produced by three species: &quot;Actinidia arguta&quot; (hardy kiwi), &quot;A. kolomikta&quot; (Arctic kiwifruit) and &quot;A. polygama&quot; (silver vine). They are fast-growing, climbing vines, durable over their growing season. They are referred to as &quot;kiwi berry, baby kiwi, dessert kiwi, grape kiwi, or cocktail kiwi&quot;.

The cultivar &#x27;Issai&#x27; is a hybrid of hardy kiwifruit and silver vine which can self-pollinate. Grown commercially because of its relatively large fruit, &#x27;Issai&#x27; is less hardy than most hardy kiwifruit.

===&quot;Actinidia chinensis&quot;===
&quot;Actinidia chinensis&quot; (yellow kiwi or golden kiwifruit) has smooth, bronze skin, with a beak shape at the stem attachment. Flesh colour varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow. This species is &#x27;sweeter and more aromatic&#x27; in flavour compared to &quot;A. deliciosa&quot;. One of the most attractive varieties has a red &#x27;iris&#x27; around the centre of the fruit and yellow flesh outside. The yellow fruit obtains a higher market price and, being less hairy than the fuzzy kiwifruit tastes better without peeling.

A commercially viable variety of this red-ringed kiwifruit, patented as EnzaRed, is a cultivar of the Chinese &quot;hong yang&quot; variety.

&#x27;Hort16A&#x27; is a golden kiwifruit cultivar marketed worldwide as &quot;Zespri Gold&quot;. This cultivar suffered significant losses in New Zealand in 2010–2013 due to the PSA bacterium. A new cultivar of golden kiwifruit, &quot;Gold3&quot;, was found to be more disease-resistant and most growers have now changed to this cultivar. &#x27;Gold3&#x27;, marketed by Zespri as &quot;SunGold&quot; is not quite as sweet as &#x27;Hort16A&#x27;, and lacks its usually slightly pointed tip.

Clones of the new variety &quot;SunGold&quot; have been used to develop orchards in China, resulting in partially successful legal efforts in China by Zespri to protect their intellectual property. In 2021, Zespri estimated that around 5,000 hectares of &quot;Sungold&quot; orchards were being cultivated in China, mainly in the Sichuan province.

==Cultivation==
Kiwifruit can be grown in most temperate climates with adequate summer heat. Where fuzzy kiwifruit (&quot;A. deliciosa&quot;) is not hardy, other species can be grown as substitutes.

===Breeding===

Often in commercial farming, different breeds are used for rootstock, fruit-bearing plants, and pollinators. Therefore, the seeds produced are crossbreeds of their parents. Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit-bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, seedlings take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwifruit is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time-consuming. Therefore, most kiwifruits, except rootstock and new cultivars, are propagated asexually. This is done by grafting the fruit-producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.

===Pollination===

Kiwifruit plants generally are dioecious, meaning a plant is either male or female. The male plants have flowers that produce pollen, the females receive the pollen to fertilise their ovules and grow fruit; most kiwifruit requires a male plant to pollinate the female plant. For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is considered adequate. Some varieties can self-pollinate, but even they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit. Cross-species pollination is often (but not always) successful as long as bloom times are synchronised.

In nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar. The female flowers produce fake anthers with what appears to be pollen on the tips to attract the pollinators, although these fake anthers lack the DNA and food value of the male anthers.

Kiwifruit growers rely on honey bees, the principal ‘for-hire’ pollinator, but commercially grown kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate. The flowers are not very attractive to honey bees, partly because the flowers do not produce nectar and bees quickly learn to prefer flowers with nectar.

Honey bees are inefficient cross-pollinators for kiwifruit because they practice “floral fidelity”. Each honey bee visits only a single type of flower in any foray and maybe only a few branches of a single plant. The pollen needed from a different plant (such as a male for a female kiwifruit) might never reach it were it not for the cross-pollination that principally occurs in the crowded colony; it is in the colonies that bees laden with different pollen cross paths.

To deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers. Most common, though, is saturation pollination, in which the honey bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.

===Maturation and harvest===
Kiwifruit is picked by hand and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.

Kiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on &#x27;one-year-old and older&#x27; canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere, the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four-year-old plants can produce 15 tonnes of fruit per hectare (14,000 lb per acre) while eight-year-old plants can produce 20 tonnes (18,000 lb per acre). The plants produce their maximum at eight to ten years old. The seasonal yields are variable; a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.

===Storage===
Fruit harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be stored for up to 8 weeks after harvest.

Firm kiwifruits ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana. Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator. If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit is normally kept for about one to two weeks.

===Pests and diseases===
&quot;Pseudomonas syringae actinidiae&quot; (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s. This bacterial strain has been controlled and managed successfully in orchards in Asia. In 1992, it was found in northern Italy. In 2007/2008, economic losses were observed, as a more virulent strain became more dominant (PSA V). In 2010 it was found in New Zealand&#x27;s Bay of Plenty Region kiwifruit orchards in the North Island. The yellow-fleshed cultivars were particularly susceptible. New, resistant varieties were selected in research funded by the government and fruit growers so that the industry could continue.

Scientists reported they had worked out the strain of PSA affecting kiwifruit from New Zealand, Italy, and Chile originated in China.
==Production==
In 2023, world kiwifruit production was 4.4 million tonnes, led by China with 55% of the total (table). In China, kiwifruit is grown mainly in the mountainous area upstream of the Yangtze River, as well as Sichuan. Other major producers were New Zealand and Italy (table).

===Production history===
Kiwifruit exports rapidly increased from the late 1960s to the early 1970s in New Zealand. By 1976, exports exceeded the amount consumed domestically. Outside of Australasia, New Zealand kiwifruit are marketed under the brand-name label Zespri. The general name, &quot;Zespri&quot;, has been used for the marketing of all cultivars of kiwifruit from New Zealand since 2012.

In the 1980s, many countries outside New Zealand grew and exported kiwifruit. In Italy, the infrastructure and techniques required to support grape production were adapted to the kiwifruit. This, coupled with being close to the European kiwifruit market, led to Italians becoming the leading producer of kiwifruit in 1989. The growing season of Italian kiwifruit does not overlap much with New Zealand or the Chilean growing seasons, therefore direct competition between New Zealand and Chile was not a significant factor.

Much of the breeding to refine the green kiwifruit was undertaken by the Plant &amp; Food Research Institute (formerly HortResearch) during the decades of &#x27;1970–1999&#x27;. In 1990, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board opened an office for Europe in Antwerp, Belgium.

==Human consumption==




Kiwifruit may be eaten raw, made into juices, used in baked goods, prepared with meat, or used as a garnish. The whole fruit, including the skin, is suitable for human consumption; however, the skin of the fuzzy varieties is often discarded due to its texture. Sliced kiwifruit has long been used as a garnish atop whipped cream on pavlova, a meringue-based dessert. Traditionally in China, kiwifruit was not eaten for pleasure but was given as medicine to children to help them grow and to women who have given birth to help them recover.

Raw kiwifruit contains actinidain (also spelled &quot;actinidin&quot;) which is commercially useful as a meat tenderizer and possibly as a digestive aid. Actinidain also makes raw kiwifruit unsuitable for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products because the enzyme digests milk proteins. This applies to gelatin-based desserts since the actinidain will dissolve the proteins in gelatin, causing the dessert to either liquefy or prevent it from solidifying.

===Nutrition===
In a amount, green kiwifruit provides of food energy, is 83% water and 15% carbohydrates, with negligible protein and fat (table). It is particularly rich in vitamin C (103% DV) and vitamin K (34% DV), potassium, and has a moderate content of vitamin E (10% DV) and copper, with no other micronutrients in significant content. Gold kiwifruit has similar nutritional value to green kiwifruit, but contains higher vitamin C content (179% DV) and insignificant vitamin K content (table). Both types of kiwifruit are rich in dietary fiber.

Kiwifruit seed oil contains on average 62% alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid. Kiwifruit pulp contains carotenoids, such as provitamin A beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin.

===Allergies===
Allergy to kiwifruit was first described in 1981, and there have since been reports of the allergy presenting with numerous symptoms from localized oral allergy syndrome to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

The actinidain found in kiwifruit can be an allergen for some individuals, including children. The most common symptoms are unpleasant itching and soreness of the mouth, with wheezing as the most common severe symptom; anaphylaxis may occur.

<doc id="17364" wikidata="Q144825" url="?curid=17364" title="Kiel Canal">
<text>The Kiel Canal (, formerly the ) is a fresh water canal that links the North Sea () to the Baltic Sea (). It runs through the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, from Brunsbüttel to the Holtenau district of Kiel. It was constructed from 1887 to 1895 and widened from 1907 to 1914. In addition to the two sea entrances, at Oldenbüttel the Kiel Canal is linked to the navigable River Eider by the short Gieselau Canal.

An average of is saved by using the Kiel Canal instead of going around the Jutland Peninsula. This saves time and fuel, avoids storm-prone seas, and avoids passing through the Danish straits. The Kiel Canal is one of the world&#x27;s most frequented artificial waterways with an annual average of 32,000 ships (90 daily), transporting approximately 100 million tonnes of goods.

==History==
The first connection between the North and Baltic Seas was constructed while the area was ruled by Denmark–Norway. It was called the Eider Canal and used stretches of the Eider River for the link between the two seas. Completed during the reign of Christian VII of Denmark in 1784, the was a part of a waterway from Kiel to the Eider River&#x27;s mouth at Tönning on the west coast. It was only wide with a depth of , which limited the vessels that could use the canal to 300 tonnes.

After 1864, the Second Schleswig War put Schleswig-Holstein under the government of Prussia (from 1871 the German Empire). A new canal was sought by merchants and by the German navy, which wanted to link its bases in the Baltic and the North Sea without the need to sail around Denmark.

=== Construction and expansion ===

In June 1887, construction started at Holtenau, near Kiel. The canal took over 9,000 workers eight years to build. On 20 June 1895, Kaiser Wilhelm II officially opened the canal for transiting from Brunsbüttel to Holtenau. The next day a ceremony took place in Holtenau, where Wilhelm II named the waterway the (after his grandfather, Kaiser Wilhelm I), and laid the final stone. British director Birt Acres filmed the opening of the canal; the Science Museum in London preserves surviving footage of this early film. The first vessel to pass through the canal was the aviso , sent through in late April (before the canal officially opened) to determine if it was ready for use. In May, the tender also passed through the canal.

To cope with the increasing traffic and the demands of the Imperial German Navy, between 1907 and 1914 the canal was widened by Germany to allow dreadnought battleships to pass through, allowing them to travel between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea without having to go around Denmark. Two larger canal locks in Brunsbüttel and Holtenau were installed to complete the enlargement.

=== After World War I ===
After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles required the canal to be open to vessels of commerce and of war of any nation at peace with Germany, while leaving it under German administration. (The United States opposed this proposal to avoid setting a precedent for similar concessions on the Panama Canal.) The government under Adolf Hitler repudiated its international status in 1936, but the canal was reopened to all traffic after World War II. In 1948, the current name was adopted.

The canal was partially closed for a period in March 2013 after two lock gates failed at the western end near Brunsbüttel. Ships larger than were forced to navigate via Skagerrak, a detour. The failure was blamed on neglect and a lack of funding by the German Federal Government, which had been in financial dispute with the state of Schleswig-Holstein regarding the canal. Germany&#x27;s Federal Transport Ministry promised rapid repairs.

==Operation==
The canal is governed by detailed traffic rules. Each vessel using the canal is categorized into one of six traffic groups according to its dimensions. Larger ships are obliged to accept pilots and specialized canal helmsmen, in some cases even the assistance of a tugboat. Furthermore, there are regulations regarding the passing of oncoming ships. Larger ships may also be required to moor at the bollards provided at intervals along the canal to allow the passage of oncoming vessels. Special rules apply to pleasure craft.

All permanent, fixed bridges crossing the canal since its construction have a clearance of .

Maximum length for ships passing the Kiel Canal is , with the maximum width (beam) of ; these ships can have a draught of up to . Ships up to a length of may have a draught up to . The bulker &quot;Ever Leader&quot; (deadweight 74001 t) is considered to be the cargo ship that to date has come closest to the overall limits.

== Crossings ==

Several railway lines and federal roads (Autobahnen and Bundesstraßen) cross the canal on eleven fixed links. The bridges have a clearance of allowing for ship heights up to . The oldest bridge still in use is the &quot;Levensau High Bridge&quot; from 1893; however, the bridge will be replaced in the course of a canal expansion already underway. In sequence and in the direction of the official kilometre count from west (Brunsbüttel) to east (Holtenau) these crossings are:
* &quot;Brunsbüttel High Bridge&quot;, four lane crossing of Bundesstraße 5
* &quot;Hochdonn High Bridge&quot; of the Marsh Railway
* &quot;Hohenhörn High Bridge&quot; for Autobahn 23
* &quot;Grünental High Bridge&quot; for railway line Neumünster-Heide and Bundesstraße 204
* &quot;Rendsburg High Bridge&quot; for the Neumünster–Flensburg railway, from which a transporter bridge, used by local traffic, is suspended
* &quot;Kanaltunnel Rendsburg&quot;, road tunnel for Bundesstraße 77 (four lanes)
* &quot;Rendsburg pedestrian tunnel&quot; 
* &quot;Rade High Bridge&quot; for Autobahn A7
* &quot;Levensau High Bridge&quot; from 1893 for the Kiel–Flensburg railway and a local road
* &quot;New Levensau High Bridge&quot; for Bundesstraße 76 (four lanes)
* &quot;Holtenau High Bridges&quot;, two parallel bridges with three car lanes each as well as pavements for pedestrians and cyclists

Local traffic is also served by 14 ferry lines. Most noteworthy is the “hanging ferry” (, literally: &quot;hovering ferry&quot;) that is hanging underneath the &quot;Rendsburg High Bridge&quot;. This hanging ferry was replaced after a collision with a ship in 2016, and returned to service in 2022. All ferries are run by the Canal Authority and their use is free of charge.

<text>Konrad Emil Bloch (; 21 January 1912 – 15 October 2000) was a German-American biochemist. Bloch received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 (joint with Feodor Lynen) for discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism.

==Life and career==

Bloch was born in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland), in the German Empire&#x27;s Prussian Province of Silesia into a Jewish family. He was the second child of middle-class parents Hedwig (Striemer) and Frederich D. &quot;Fritz&quot; Bloch. He was a student Carolinum in Nysa and then 1930 to 1934, he studied chemistry at the Technical University of Munich. In 1934, due to the Nazi persecutions of Jews, he fled to the &quot;Schweizerische Forschungsinstitut&quot; in Davos, Switzerland, before moving to the United States in 1936. Later he was appointed to the department of biological chemistry at Yale Medical School.

In the United States, Bloch enrolled at Columbia University, and received a PhD in biochemistry in 1938. He taught at Columbia from 1939 to 1946. From there he went to the University of Chicago and then to Harvard University as Higgins Professor of Biochemistry in 1954, a post he held until 1982. From 1979 until 1984, he was a professor of science at their School of Public Health. After retirement at Harvard, he served as the Mack and Effie Campbell Tyner Eminent Scholar Chair in the College of Human Sciences at Florida State University.

Bloch shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 with his compatriat Feodor Lynen, for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Their work showed that the body first makes squalene from acetate over many steps and then converts the squalene to cholesterol. He traced all the carbon atoms in cholesterol back to acetate. Some of his research was conducted using radioactive acetate in bread mold: this was possible because fungi also produce squalene. He confirmed his results using rats. He was one of several researchers who showed that acetyl Coenzyme A is turned into mevalonic acid. Both Bloch and Lynen then showed that mevalonic acid is converted into chemically active isoprene, the precursor to squalene. Bloch also discovered that bile and a female sex hormone were made from cholesterol, which led to the discovery that all steroids were made from cholesterol. His Nobel Lecture was &quot;The Biological Synthesis of Cholesterol.&quot;

In 1985, Bloch became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1988, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.
Bloch and his wife Lore Teutsch first met in Munich. They married in the U.S. in 1941. They had two children, Peter Conrad Bloch and Susan Elizabeth Bloch, and two grandchildren, Benjamin Nieman Bloch and Emilie Bloch Sondel. They lived for many decades in the mid-century modern enclave Six Moon Hill in Lexington, Massachusetts . He was fond of skiing, tennis, and music. Konrad died in Burlington, Massachusetts of congestive heart failure in 2000, aged 88. Lore Bloch died in 2010 aged 98.

<text>Klement Gottwald (; 23 November 1896 – 14 March 1953) was a Czech communist politician, who was the leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia from 1929 until his death in 1953 – titled as general secretary until 1945 and as chairman from 1945 to 1953. He was the first leader of Communist Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1953.

Following the collapse of democratic Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement, the right-wing leadership of the Czechoslovak Second Republic banned the Communist Party, forcing Gottwald to emigrate to the Soviet Union in November 1938. In 1943, Gottwald agreed with representatives of the Czechoslovak-government-in-exile located in London, along with President Edvard Beneš, to unify domestic and foreign anti-fascist resistance and form the National Front. He was the 14th prime minister of Czechoslovakia from July 1946 until June 1948, the first Communist to hold the post. In June 1948, he was elected as Czechoslovakia&#x27;s first Communist president, four months after the 1948 coup d&#x27;état in which his party seized power with the backing of the Soviet Union. He held the post until his death.

==Early life==

=== Childhood and youth ===
Klement Gottwald was born on 23 November 1896, but it is unclear if in Dědice (today part of Vyškov) or in Hoštice-Heroltice. His mother was an unmarried maidservant. Before World War I he was trained in Vienna as a carpenter but also actively participated in the activities of the Social Democratic youth movement.

=== Personal life ===
Klement Gottwald was married to Marta Gottwaldová who came from a poor family and was an illegitimate child. Although his wife stood by him through his endeavours, and was his faithful companion, she never joined the Communist Party. They had one daughter, Marta (1920–1998), who married Alexey Čepička.

=== First World War ===
From 1915 to 1918 Gottwald was a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army. It is believed that he fought in the Battle of Zborov, which would mean that he fought there against future General and President Ludvík Svoboda, who fought on the side of the Czechoslovak Legion. Thomas Jakl of the Military History Institute called Gottwald&#x27;s participation in the Battle of Zborov a legend: Gottwald was in a hospital in Vienna during the time of the battle. In the summer of 1918, Gottwald deserted from the army. After the establishment of the first Czechoslovak Republic, he served for two years in the Czechoslovak Army. From 1920 to 1921 he worked in Rousinov as a cabinetmaker.

==Career==

=== Sports instructor and journalist ===

After the collapse of the , the Communist-oriented party of the organization split off in 1921 and created the (FDTJ). Gottwald was able to unify the organization to gain considerable power in the local districts, and became the of the 20th district of the FDTJ. In June 1921, he participated in the first Spartakiada in Prague. In September 1921 he moved from Rousinov to Banská Bystrica, where he became the editor of the communist magazine (&quot;Voice of the people&quot; in Slovak). At the same time, he was planning FDTJ events at the Banská Bystrica district. He became the local of the district, and was the managing director of the 47th district of the FDTJ. Later, he moved to Žilina and became editor in chief of magazine. In 1922 he moved to Vrútky, where by decision of the Communist Party Central Committee, they merged a number of communist magazines and consolidated editors. In 1924, the editorial staff, along with Gottwald, moved to Ostrava.

=== Beginning of political activity ===

In 1926, Gottwald became a functionary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), and editor of the Communist Press. From 1926 to 1929 he worked in Prague, where he aided the Secretariat of the KSČ to form a pro-Moscow opposition against the anti-Moscow leadership then in power. From 1928 he was a member of the Comintern. Following a Comintern policy initiated by Stalin, he carried out the Bolshevization of the Party.

In February 1929, at the of the KSČ, Gottwald was elected party general secretary, alongside , Jan Šverma, Rudolf Slánský, Václav Kopecký and , together known as the .

In the second half of 1930, the Communist Party carried out a number of reforms in accordance and response with the changes in those of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, namely the introduction of the policy on the formation of a popular front against fascism. In September and October 1938, Gottwald was one of the main leaders of the opposition against the adoption of the Munich Agreement.

=== Exile to the USSR ===

After the banning of the Communist Party, Gottwald emigrated to the Soviet Union in November 1938. While there, he opposed the party policy of backing the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact of 1939. After the attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Soviet leadership saw the front against fascism as a great opportunity to assert themselves in Czechoslovakia, promoting interest in supporting Gottwald after the liberation of Czechoslovakia. In 1943, Gottwald agreed with representatives of the Czechoslovak-government-in-exile located in London, along with President Edvard Beneš, to unify domestic and foreign anti-fascist resistance and form the National Front. This proved helpful for Gottwald as it helped secure Communist influence in post-war Czechoslovakia.

=== Return to Czechoslovakia and events leading up to the coup ===
In 1945, Gottwald gave up the general secretary&#x27;s post to Rudolf Slánský and was elected to the new position of party chairman. On 10 May 1945, Gottwald returned to Prague as the deputy premier under Zdeněk Fierlinger and as the chairman of the National Front. In March 1946, he became prime minister after leading the KSČ to a 38% share of the vote. This was easily the best showing for a Czechoslovak party in a free election at the time; previously, no party had ever won more than 25 percent.

Gottwald was a firm supporter of the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia, gaining mainstream credibility with many Czechs through the use of nationalist rhetoric, exhorting the population to &quot;prepare for the final retribution for White Mountain, for the return of the Czech lands to the Czech people. We will expel for good all descendants of the alien German nobility.&quot;

== Сoup d&#x27;état ==

By the summer of 1947, however, the KSČ&#x27;s popularity had significantly dwindled, particularly after the Soviets pressured Czechoslovakia to turn down Marshall Plan aid after initially accepting it. Most observers believed Gottwald would be turned out of office at the elections due in May 1948. The Communists&#x27; dwindling popularity, combined with France and Italy dropping the Communists from their coalition governments, prompted Joseph Stalin to order Gottwald to begin efforts to eliminate parliamentary opposition to Communism in Czechoslovakia.

Outwardly, though, Gottwald kept up the appearance of working within the system, announcing that he intended to lead the Communists to an absolute majority in the upcoming election—something no Czechoslovak party had ever done. The endgame began in February 1948, when a majority of the Cabinet directed the Communist interior minister, Václav Nosek, to stop packing the police force with Communists. Nosek ignored this directive, with Gottwald&#x27;s support. In response, 12 non-Communist ministers resigned. They believed that without their support, Gottwald would be unable to govern and be forced to either give way or resign. Beneš initially supported their position, and refused to accept their resignations. At that point, Gottwald dropped all pretense of liberal democracy. He not only refused to resign, but demanded the appointment of a Communist-dominated government under threat of a general strike. His Communist colleagues occupied the offices of the non-Communist ministers.

On 25 February, Beneš, fearing Soviet intervention, gave in. He accepted the resignations of the non-Communist ministers and appointed a new government in accordance with Gottwald&#x27;s specifications. Although ostensibly still a coalition, it was dominated by Communists and pro-Moscow Social Democrats. The other parties were still nominally represented, but with the exception of Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk they were fellow travellers handpicked by the Communists. From this date forward, Gottwald was effectively the most powerful man in Czechoslovakia.
On 9 May, the National Assembly, now a docile tool of the Communists, approved the so-called Ninth-of-May Constitution. While it was not a completely Communist document, its Communist imprint was strong enough that Beneš refused to sign it. Later that month, elections were held in which voters were presented with a single list from the National Front, now a Communist-controlled patriotic organization. Beneš resigned on 2 June. In accordance with the 1920 Constitution, Gottwald took over most presidential functions until 14 June, when he was formally elected as President.

==Leadership of Czechoslovakia==
Gottwald initially tried to take a semi-independent line. However, that changed shortly after a meeting with Stalin. Under Stalin&#x27;s direction, Gottwald imposed the Stalinist Soviet model of government on the country. He nationalized the country&#x27;s industry and initiated the collectivization of Czechoslovak farms. There was considerable resistance within the government to Soviet influence on Czechoslovak politics. In response, Gottwald instigated a series of purges. Perceived opponents were often jailed or condemned to forced labor. His regime conducted a number of show trials, including the trial of the non-Communist politician Milada Horakova as well as fellow comrades and Communist party leaders Rudolf Slánský and Vlado Clementis, both of whom were executed in December 1952. Many Communist leaders subjected to show trials had been part of a tight-knit group of Communists around Gottwald in the interwar period. In a famous photograph from 21 February 1948, described also in &quot;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&quot; by Milan Kundera, Clementis stands next to Gottwald. When Clementis was charged in 1950, he was erased from the photograph (along with the photographer Karel Hájek) by the state propaganda department.

==Death==

Gottwald was a long-time alcoholic and suffered from heart disease caused by
syphilis that had gone untreated for several years. Shortly after attending Stalin&#x27;s funeral on 9 March 1953, one of his arteries burst. He died five days later on 14 March 1953, aged 56. He was the first Czechoslovak president to die in office.

Gottwald&#x27;s embalmed body was initially displayed in a mausoleum at the site of the Jan Žižka national monument in the district of Žižkov, Prague. In 1962, the personality cult ended and it was no longer deemed appropriate to show Gottwald&#x27;s body. There are accounts that in 1962 Gottwald&#x27;s body had blackened and was decomposing due to a botched embalming, although other witnesses have disputed this. His body was cremated, the ashes returned to the Žižka Monument and placed in a sarcophagus.

After the end of the communist period, Gottwald&#x27;s ashes were removed from the Žižka Monument (in 1990) and placed in a common grave at Prague&#x27;s Olšany Cemetery, together with the ashes of about 20 other communist leaders which had also originally been placed in the Žižka Monument. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia now maintains that common grave.

==Legacy==
He was succeeded as &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Czechoslovakia by Antonín Novotný, who became First Secretary of the KSČ. Antonín Zápotocký, who had been prime minister since 1948, succeeded Gottwald as president.

In tribute, Zlín, a city in Moravia, now the Czech Republic, was renamed &quot;Gottwaldov&quot; after him from 1949 to 1989. Zmiiv, a city in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, was named &quot;Gotvald&quot; after him from 1976 to 1990.

A major square and park in Bratislava was named &quot;Gottwaldovo námestie&quot; after him, later becoming Námestie Slobody &quot;(Freedom square)&quot; immediately following the Velvet Revolution. The original eponym persists today, the square being referred to by locals as &quot;Gottko&quot;. A bridge in Prague that is now called Nuselský Most was once called Gottwaldův Most, and the abutting metro station now called Vyšehrad was called Gottwaldova.
A Czechoslovak 100 Koruna banknote issued on 1 October 1989 as part of the 1985–89 banknote series included a portrait of Gottwald. This note was so poorly received by Czechoslovaks that it was removed from official circulation on 31 December 1990 and was promptly replaced with the previous banknote issue of the same denomination.

In 2005 he was voted &quot;The Greatest Villain&quot; in the &quot;Největší Čech&quot; poll of the Czech Television (a program under the BBC licence 100 Greatest Britons). He received 26% of the votes.

Wiesenau in Brandenburg, (former East) Germany keeps a street named after Gottwald.

<text>Kettlebaston is a village and a civil parish with just over 30 inhabitants in the Babergh district of Suffolk, England, located around east of Lavenham. From the 2011 Census the population of the village was not maintained and is included in the civil parish of Chelsworth. It derives its name from Kitelbeornastuna, (Kitelbjorn&#x27;s farmstead - O.Scand. pers. name + O.E. Tun), later evolving to Kettlebarston, (which is how the name is still pronounced), and finally to the current spelling. Its existence was first recorded in 1086 in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;.

==History==
Once in an area of great wealth, the demise of the mediaeval wool trade was indirectly the saving of the village, (as we know it today), since the locals were unable to afford the expense of upgrading their houses with the latest architectural fashions. The number of timber-framed houses slowly declined over the years, as did the population - from over 200 at its peak, to the point when the village was on the brink of extinction. By the 1960s, with the road no more than an unmade track, and no electricity or mains water supplies, (it still has no gas or main drains), Kettlebaston was barely standing. In the &quot;Spotlight On The Suffolk Scene&quot; article, of the &quot;Chronicle &amp; Mercury&quot; in June 1949, it was noted that a great many houses were category five - derelict, and ready for demolition.

As the agricultural workers left the land in search of other jobs, due to the increased mechanisation of farm work, &quot;outsiders&quot; discovered the secluded beauty of the rural Suffolk countryside, and a new age dawned. The tiny workmen&#x27;s cottages, which once housed huge families - and some stock and chickens according to local accounts - were lovingly renovated and converted, and the village was reborn, and went on to proudly win Babergh Best Kept Village, and runner up in the Suffolk Community Council Best Kept Village Competition, in 1989.

The village sign, bearing two crossed sceptres topped with doves, was erected to mark the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It also commemorates that, in 1445, Henry VI granted the manor of Kettlebaston to William de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk, in return for the service of carrying a golden sceptre at the coronation of all the future Kings of England, and an ivory sceptre to carry at the coronation of Margaret of Anjou, and all future Queens. This honour continued until Henry VIII resumed the manor, although it was later regranted it was without the royal service.

===Parish church===
The parish church of St Mary the Virgin has Norman origins, and features a font from around 1200. The building is listed as Grade I. It is recorded that the church was then &quot;built anew&quot; in 1342, remaining largely unchanged until targeted by Protestant iconoclasts in the 1540s. Today it features one of Suffolk&#x27;s finest post-Reformation rood screens, designed by Father Ernest Geldart and decorated by Patrick Osborne, and Enid Chadwick, and a rare Sacred Heart altar upon a Stuart Holy Table. It now lacks the small lead spire which once topped the tower.
Regarded as a place of pilgrimage to the followers of the Anglo-Catholic movement from all over the UK, Kettlebaston was the liturgically highest of all Suffolk&#x27;s Anglican churches. From 1930, until his retirement in 1964, Reverend Father Harold Clear Butler said Roman Mass every day, and celebrated High Mass and Benediction on Sundays. He also removed state notices from the porch, and refused to keep registers, or to recognise the office of the local Archdeacon of Sudbury. Despite opposition, the church finally received electric heating and lighting in 2014.

==The village today==
The current village has no shop, school, or pub.

<text>Karl Amadeus Hartmann (2 August 1905 – 5 December 1963) was a German composer. A major figure of the musical life of post-war Germany, he has been described as the greatest German symphonist of the 20th century.

==Life==
Born in Munich, the son of Friedrich Richard Hartmann, and the youngest of four brothers of whom the elder three became painters, Hartmann was himself torn, early in his career, between music and the visual arts. He was much affected in his early political development by the events of the unsuccessful Workers’ Revolution in Bavaria that followed the collapse of the German empire at the end of World War I (see Bavarian Soviet Republic). He remained an idealistic socialist for the rest of his life.

At the Munich Academy in the 1920s, Hartmann studied with Joseph Haas, a pupil of Max Reger, and later received intellectual stimulus and encouragement from the conductor Hermann Scherchen, an ally of the Schoenberg school, with whom he had a nearly lifelong mentor-protégé relationship. He voluntarily withdrew completely from musical life in Germany during the Nazi era, while remaining in Germany, and refused to allow his works to be played there. An early symphonic poem, &quot;Miserae&quot; (1933–1934, first performed in Prague, 1935) was condemned by the Nazi regime but his work continued to be performed, and his fame grew, abroad. A number of Hartmann&#x27;s compositions show the profound effect of the political climate. His &quot;Miserae&quot; (1933–34) was dedicated to his &#x27;friends...who sleep for all eternity; we do not forget you (Dachau, 1933–34)&#x27;, referring to Dachau Concentration Camp, and was condemned by the Nazis. His piano sonata &quot;27 April 1945&quot; portrays 20,000 prisoners from Dachau whom Hartmann witnessed being led away from Allied forces at the end of the war.

During World War II, though already an experienced composer, Hartmann submitted to a course of private tuition in Vienna by Schoenberg’s pupil Anton Webern (with whom he often disagreed on a personal and political level). Although stylistically their music had little in common, he clearly felt that he needed, and benefited from, Webern&#x27;s acute perfectionism.

After the fall of Adolf Hitler, Hartmann was one of the few prominent surviving anti-fascists in Bavaria whom the postwar Allied administration could appoint to a position of responsibility. In 1945, he became a &quot;dramaturge&quot; at the Bavarian State Opera and there, as one of the few internationally recognized figures who had survived untainted by any collaboration with the Nazi regime, he became a vital figure in the rebuilding of (West) German musical life. Perhaps his most notable achievement was the Musica Viva concert series, which he founded and ran for the rest of his life in Munich. Beginning in November 1945, the concerts reintroduced the German public to 20th-century repertoire, which had been banned since 1933 under National Socialist aesthetic policy. Hartmann also provided a platform for the music of young composers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, helping to establish such figures as Hans Werner Henze, Luigi Nono, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carl Orff, Iannis Xenakis, Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Bernd Alois Zimmermann and many others. Hartmann also involved sculptors and artists such as Jean Cocteau, Le Corbusier, and Joan Miró in exhibitions at Musica Viva.

He was accorded numerous honours after the war, including the Musikpreis of the city of Munich in March 1949. This was followed by the Kunstpreis of the Bayerische Akademie der Schönen Künste (1950), the Arnold Schönberg Medal of the IGNM (1954), the Große Kunstpreis of the Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (1957), as well as the Ludwig Spohr Award of the city of Braunschweig, the Schwabing Kunstpreis (1961) and the Bavarian Medal of Merit (1959). Hartmann became a member of the Academy of Arts in Munich (1952) and Berlin (1955) and received an honorary doctorate from Spokane Conservatory, Washington (1962). His socialist sympathies did not extend to the Soviet Union&#x27;s variety of communism, and in the 1950s, he refused an offer to move to East Germany.

Hartmann continued to base his activities in Munich for the remainder of his life, and his administrative duties came to absorb much of his time and energy. This reduced his time for composition, and his last years were dogged by serious illness. In 1963, he died of stomach cancer at the age of 58, leaving his last work – an extended symphonic &quot;Gesangsszene&quot; for voice and orchestra on words from Jean Giraudoux’s apocalyptic drama &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; – unfinished.

==Output and style==
Hartmann completed a number of works, most notably eight symphonies. The first of these, and perhaps emblematic of the difficult genesis of many of his works, is Symphony No. 1, &quot;Essay for a Requiem&quot; (&quot;Versuch eines Requiems&quot;). It began in 1936 as a cantata for alto solo and orchestra loosely based on a few poems by Walt Whitman. It soon became known as &quot;Our Life: Symphonic Fragment&quot; (&quot;Unser Leben: Symphonisches Fragment&quot;) and was intended as a comment on the generally miserable conditions for artists and liberal-minded people under the early Nazi regime. After the defeat of the Third Reich in World War II, the regime&#x27;s real victims had become clear, and the cantata&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Symphonic Fragment: Attempt at a Requiem&quot; to honor the millions killed in the Holocaust. Hartmann revised the work in 1954–55 as his Symphony No. 1, and published it in 1956. As this example indicates, he was a highly self-critical composer and many of his works went through successive stages of revision. He also suppressed most of his substantial orchestral works of the late 1930s and the war years, either allowing them to remain unpublished or, in several cases, reworking them – or portions of them – into the series of numbered symphonies that he produced in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
Perhaps the most frequently performed of his symphonies are No. 4, for strings, and No. 6; probably his most widely known work, through performances and recordings, is his Concerto funebre for violin and strings, composed at the beginning of World War II and making use of a Hussite chorale and a Russian revolutionary song of 1905.

Hartmann attempted a synthesis of many different idioms, including musical expressionism and jazz stylization, into organic symphonic forms in the tradition of Bruckner and Mahler. His early works are both satirical and politically engaged. But he admired the polyphonic mastery of J.S. Bach, the profound expressive irony of Mahler, and the neoclassicism of Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. In the 1930s he developed close ties with Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály in Hungary, and this is reflected in his music to some extent. In the 1940s, he began to take an interest in Schoenbergian twelve-tone technique; though he studied with Webern his own idiom was closer to Alban Berg. In the 1950s, Hartmann started to explore the metrical techniques pioneered by Boris Blacher and Elliott Carter. Among his most-used forms are three-part adagio slow movements, fugues, variations and toccatas.

==Reputation and legacy==
Significantly, championed his music following his death: Scherchen, his most noted advocate, died in 1966. Some have suggested that this accelerated the disappearance of Hartmann&#x27;s music from public view in the years following his death. Conductors who regularly performed Hartmann&#x27;s music include Rafael Kubelik and Ferdinand Leitner, who recorded the third and sixth symphonies. More recent champions of works by Hartmann include Ingo Metzmacher and Mariss Jansons.

Hans Werner Henze said of Hartmann&#x27;s music: 
Symphonic architecture was essential for him... as a suitable medium for reflecting the world as he experienced and understood it – as an agonizingly dramatic battle, as contradiction and conflict – in order to be able to achieve self-realization in its dialectic and to portray himself as a man among men, a man of this world, and not out of this world.

The English composer John McCabe wrote his &quot;Variations on a Theme of Karl Amadeus Hartmann&quot; (1964) in tribute. It uses the opening of Hartmann&#x27;s Fourth Symphony as its theme. Henze made a version of Hartmann&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 2 for full orchestra.

<doc id="17379" wikidata="Q524158" url="?curid=17379" title="Kami">
<text>are the deities, divinities, spirits, mythological, spiritual, or natural phenomena that are venerated in the traditional Shinto religion of Japan. &quot;Kami&quot; can be elements of the landscape, forces of nature, beings and the qualities that these beings express, and/or the spirits of venerated dead people. Many &quot;kami&quot; are considered the ancient ancestors of entire clans (some ancestors became &quot;kami&quot; upon their death if they were able to embody the values and virtues of &quot;kami&quot; in life). Traditionally, great leaders like the Emperor could be or became &quot;kami&quot;.

In Shinto, &quot;kami&quot; are not separate from nature, but are of nature, possessing positive and negative, and good and evil characteristics. They are manifestations of , the interconnecting energy of the universe, and are considered exemplary of what humanity should strive towards. &quot;Kami&quot; are believed to be &quot;hidden&quot; from this world, and inhabit a complementary existence that mirrors our own: . To be in harmony with the awe-inspiring aspects of nature is to be conscious of .

== Meaning ==

&quot;Kami&quot; is the Japanese word for a deity, divinity, or spirit. It has been used to describe mind, God, Supreme Being, one of the Shinto deities, an effigy, a principle, and anything that is worshipped.

Although &quot;deity&quot; is the common interpretation of &quot;kami&quot;, some Shinto scholars argue that such a translation can cause a misunderstanding of the term.

Some etymological suggestions are:
* &quot;Kami&quot; may, at its root, simply mean &quot;spirit&quot;, or an aspect of spirituality. It is written with the kanji , Sino-Japanese reading &quot;shin&quot; or &quot;jin&quot;. In Chinese, the character means &quot;deity&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;.
* In the Ainu language, the word &quot;kamuy&quot; refers to an animistic concept very similar to Japanese &quot;kami&quot;. The matter of the words&#x27; origins is still a subject of debate; but it is generally suggested that the word &quot;kami&quot; was derived from Ainu word &quot;kamuy&quot;.
* In his , Motoori Norinaga gave a definition of &quot;kami&quot;: &quot;any being whatsoever which possesses some eminent quality out of the ordinary, and is awe-inspiring, is called kami.&quot;

Because Japanese does not normally distinguish grammatical number in nouns (most do not have singular and plural forms), it is sometimes unclear whether &quot;kami&quot; refers to a single or multiple entities. When a singular concept is needed, is used as a suffix. The reduplicated term generally used to refer to multiple &quot;kami&quot; is &quot;kamigami&quot;.

== History ==

While Shinto has no founder, no overarching doctrine, and no religious texts, the (Records of Ancient Matters), written in 712 CE, and the (Chronicles of Japan), written in 720 CE, contain the earliest record of Japanese creation myths. The also includes descriptions of various &quot;kami&quot;.

In the ancient traditions there were five defining characteristics of &quot;kami&quot;:
# &quot;Kami&quot; are of two minds. They can nurture and love when respected, or they can cause destruction and disharmony when disregarded. &quot;Kami&quot; must be appeased in order to gain their favor and avoid their wrath. Traditionally, &quot;kami&quot; possess two souls, one gentle (&quot;nigi-mitama&quot;) and the other assertive (&quot;ara-mitama&quot;); additionally, in &quot;Yamakage Shinto&quot; (see &quot;Ko-Shintō&quot;), &quot;kami&quot; have two additional souls that are hidden: one happy (&quot;saki-mitama&quot;) and one mysterious (&quot;kushi-mitama&quot;).
# &quot;Kami&quot; are not visible to the human realm. Instead, they inhabit sacred places, natural phenomena, or people during rituals that ask for their blessing.
# They are mobile, visiting their places of worship, of which there can be several, but never staying forever.
# There are many different varieties of &quot;kami&quot;. There are 300 different classifications of &quot;kami&quot; listed in the , and they all have different functions, such as the &quot;kami&quot; of wind, &quot;kami&quot; of entryways, and &quot;kami&quot; of roads.
# Lastly, all &quot;kami&quot; have a different guardianship or duty to the people around them. Just as the people have an obligation to keep the &quot;kami&quot; happy, the &quot;kami&quot; have to perform the specific function of the object, place, or idea they inhabit.
&quot;Kami&quot; are an ever-changing concept, but their presence in Japanese life has remained constant. The &quot;kami&#x27;s&quot; earliest roles were as earth-based spirits, assisting the early hunter-gatherer groups in their daily lives. They were worshipped as gods of the earth (mountains) and sea. As the cultivation of rice became increasingly important and predominant in Japan, the &quot;kami&#x27;s&quot; identity shifted to more sustaining roles that were directly involved in the growth of crops; roles such as rain, earth, and rice. This relationship between early Japanese people and the &quot;kami&quot; was manifested in rituals and ceremonies meant to entreat the &quot;kami&quot; to grow and protect the harvest. These rituals also became a symbol of power and strength for the early Emperors.

There is a strong tradition of myth-histories in the Shinto faith; one such myth details the appearance of the first emperor, grandson of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu. In this myth, when Amaterasu sent her grandson to earth to rule, she gave him five rice grains, which had been grown in the fields of heaven (Takamagahara). This rice made it possible for him to transform the &quot;wilderness&quot;.

Social and political strife have played a key role in the development of new sorts of &quot;kami&quot;, specifically the &quot;goryō-shin&quot; (the sacred spirit &quot;kami&quot;). &quot;Goryō&quot; are the vengeful spirits of the dead whose lives were cut short, but they were calmed by the devotion of Shinto followers and are now believed to punish those who do not honor the &quot;kami&quot;.

The pantheon of &quot;kami&quot;, like the &quot;kami&quot; themselves, is forever changing in definition and scope. As the needs of the people have shifted, so too have the domains and roles of the various &quot;kami&quot;. Some examples of this are related to health, such as the &quot;kami&quot; of smallpox whose role was expanded to include all contagious diseases, or the &quot;kami&quot; of boils and growths who has also come to preside over cancers and cancer treatments.

In ancient animistic Japanese belief, &quot;kami&quot; were understood as simply the divine forces of nature. Worshippers in ancient Japan revered &quot;kami&quot; of nature which exhibited a particular beauty and power such as ghosts, the ocean, the sun, waterfalls, mountains, boulders, animals, trees, grasses, rice paddies, thunder, echoes, foxes and fox spirits, and Asian dragons. They strongly believed the spirits or resident &quot;kami&quot; deserved respect.

In 927 CE, the was promulgated in fifty volumes. This, the first formal codification of Shinto rites and &quot;norito&quot; (liturgies and prayers) to survive, became the basis for all subsequent Shinto liturgical practice and efforts. It listed all of the 2,861 Shinto shrines existing at the time, and the 3,131 official-recognized and enshrined &quot;kami&quot;. The number of &quot;kami&quot; has grown and far exceeded this figure through the following generations as there are over 2,446,000 individual &quot;kami&quot; enshrined in Tokyo&#x27;s Yasukuni Shrine alone.

== Shinto belief ==

&quot;Kami&quot; are the central objects of worship for the Shinto belief. The best English translation of &quot;kami&quot; is &#x27;spirits&#x27;, but this is an over-simplification of a complex concept - kami can be elements of the landscape or forces of nature. Kami are believed to have influence over the forces of nature and over the affairs of humans. The ancient animistic spirituality of Japan was the beginning of modern Shinto, which became a formal spiritual institution later, in an effort to preserve the traditional beliefs from the encroachment of imported religious ideas. As a result, the nature of what can be called &quot;kami&quot; is very general and encompasses many different concepts and phenomena.

Some of the objects or phenomena designated as &quot;kami&quot; are qualities of growth, fertility, and production; natural phenomena like wind and thunder; natural objects like the sun, mountains, rivers, trees, and rocks; some animals; and ancestral spirits. Included within the designation of ancestral spirits are spirits of the ancestors of the Imperial House of Japan, but also ancestors of noble families as well as the spirits of the ancestors of all people, which when they died were believed to be the guardians of their descendants.

There are other spirits designated as &quot;kami&quot; as well. For example, the guardian spirits of the land, occupations, and skills; spirits of Japanese heroes, men of outstanding deeds or virtues, and those who have contributed to civilization, culture, and human welfare; those who have died for the state or the community; and the pitiable dead. Not only spirits superior to man can be considered &quot;kami&quot;; spirits that are considered pitiable or weak have also been considered &quot;kami&quot; in Shinto.

The concept of &quot;kami&quot; has been changed and refined since ancient times, although anything that was considered to be &quot;kami&quot; by ancient people will still be considered &quot;kami&quot; in modern Shinto. Even within modern Shinto, there are no clearly defined criteria for what should or should not be worshipped as kami. The difference between modern Shinto and the ancient animistic religions is mainly a refinement of the &quot;kami&quot;-concept, rather than a difference in definitions.

Although the ancient designations are still adhered to, in modern Shinto many priests also consider &quot;kami&quot; to be anthropomorphic spirits, with nobility and authority. One such example is the mythological figure Amaterasu-ōmikami, the sun goddess of the Shinto pantheon. Although these &quot;kami&quot; can be considered deities, they are not necessarily considered omnipotent or omniscient, and like the Greek Gods, they had flawed personalities and were quite capable of ignoble acts. In the myths of Amaterasu, for example, she could see the events of the human world, but had to use divination rituals to see the future.

There are considered to be three main variations of &quot;kami&quot;: , , and . (&quot;&quot; literally means eight million, but idiomatically it expresses &quot;uncountably many&quot; and &quot;all-around&quot;—like many East Asian cultures, the Japanese often use the number 8, representing the cardinal and ordinal directions, to symbolize ubiquity.) These classifications of &quot;kami&quot; are not considered strictly divided, due to the fluid and shifting nature of &quot;kami&quot;, but are instead held as guidelines for grouping them.

The ancestors of a particular family can also be worshipped as &quot;kami&quot;. In this sense, these &quot;kami&quot; are worshipped not because of their godly powers, but because of a distinctive quality or virtue. These &quot;kami&quot; are celebrated regionally, and several miniature shrines (&quot;hokora&quot;) have been built in their honor. In many cases, people who once lived are thus revered; an example of this is Tenjin, who was Sugawara no Michizane (845–903 CE) in life.

Within Shinto it is believed that the nature of life is sacred because the &quot;kami&quot; began human life. Yet people cannot perceive this divine nature, which the kami created, on their own; therefore, , or purification, is necessary in order to see the divine nature. This purification can only be granted by the &quot;kami&quot;. In order to please the &quot;kami&quot; and earn &quot;magokoro&quot;, Shinto followers are taught to uphold the four affirmations of Shinto.

The first affirmation is to hold fast to tradition and the family. Family is seen as the main mechanism by which traditions are preserved. For instance, in marriage or birth, tradition is potentially observed and passed onto future generations. The second affirmation is to have a love of nature. Nature objects are worshipped as sacred because the &quot;kami&quot; inhabit them. Therefore, to be in contact with nature means to be in contact with the gods. The third affirmation is to maintain physical cleanliness. Followers of Shinto take baths, wash their hands, and rinse out their mouths often. The last affirmation is to practice matsuri, which is the worship and honor given to the &quot;kami&quot; and ancestral spirits.

Shinto followers also believe that the &quot;kami&quot; are the ones who can either grant blessings or curses to a person. Shinto believers desire to appease the evil kami to &quot;stay on their good side&quot;, and also to please the good &quot;kami&quot;. In addition to practicing the four affirmations daily, Shinto believers also wear &quot;omamori&quot; to aid them in remaining pure and protected. Mamori are charms that keep the evil &quot;kami&quot; from striking a human with sickness or causing disaster to befall them.

The &quot;kami&quot; are both worshipped and respected within the religion of Shinto. The goal of life to Shinto believers is to obtain &quot;magokoro&quot;, a pure sincere heart, which can only be granted by the &quot;kami&quot;. As a result, Shinto followers are taught that humankind should venerate both the living and the nonliving, because both possess a divine superior spirit within: the &quot;kami&quot;.

=== Amatsukami and Kunitsukami ===

Amatsukami and Kunitsukami are categories of kami in Japanese mythology.

Amatsugami is a generic term for the gods in Takamagahara or those who descended from Tenson kōrin, while Kunitsugami is a generic term for the gods who appeared on the earth (Ashihara no Nakatsukuni).

In Japanese mythology, the acceptance of the transfer of the land (Ashihara no Nakatsukuni) by the Kunitsugami to the Amatsu deities led by Ninigi is described as Kuni Yuzuri. It is thought that the deity worshipped by the people of the region (Emishi, Hayato, etc.) who were pacified by the Yamato Kingship became the Kunitsugami, and the deity worshipped by the imperial family and powerful clans of the Yamato Kingship became the Amatsukami. Many of the original traditions of the Kunitsugami were altered when they were incorporated into the Chronicles, and many of them have not survived.The Chronicles of Japan cites certain passages (e.g., &quot;Ichi Sho Saying&quot; and &quot;Aru Hon Yun&quot; in most volumes of the Nihon Shoki), but the original recorded documents have been lost in later generations.

&quot;Tsu&quot; is a case particle in Old Japanese, meaning &quot;god of heaven&quot; or &quot;god of the country&quot; in modern Japanese. Sometimes written &quot;Amatsugami&quot; or &quot;Kunitsugami.

Amatsugami are also called Tenjin, and Kunitsukami are called . Some people believe that the names &quot; and &quot; are derived from the Chinese classics. The different theory that the concept is completely different and different from the Japanese one has been presented.

Another similar concept is .

 (Tenchi-Shinmei) is a Japanese four-character idiom that refers to the gods of heaven and earth. It is used in expressions such as &quot;I swear by the gods of heaven and earth&quot; and conveys a sense of reverence and commitment. The origins of the term can be traced back to ancient Chinese classical texts, where the expression &quot; (Tenchi) and &quot; (Shinmei) were often used together to refer to the gods of heaven and earth, or to the gods and the universe as a whole. However, there are also instances where the expression was used to refer specifically to the gods of heaven and earth. In Japan, the term has been in use for centuries and is often associated with the image of the numerous gods and deities that have been worshipped in Japanese folklore and mythology.

Susanoo-no-Mikoto, who was cast out of Takamagahara, and his descendants, such as Ōkuninushi, are considered to be Kunitsugami.

 proposed a system justifying Japanese Imperialism where Japanese people in the colonies were seen as Amatsukami and natives were seen as Kunitsukami, however he was later censored as his position was considered too supportive of the rights of colonized peoples.

== Ceremonies and festivals ==
One of the first recorded rituals we know of is , the ceremony in which the Emperor offers newly harvested rice to the &quot;kami&quot; to secure their blessing for a bountiful harvest. A yearly festival, Niiname-sai, is also performed when a new Emperor comes to power, in which case it is called . In the ceremony, the Emperor offers crops from the new harvest to the &quot;kami&quot;, including rice, fish, fruits, soup, and stew. The Emperor first feasts with the deities, then the guests. The feast could go on for some time; for example, Emperor Shōwa&#x27;s feast spanned two days.

Visitors to a Shinto shrine follow a purification ritual before presenting themselves to the &quot;kami&quot;. This ritual begins with hand washing and swallowing and later spitting a small amount of water in front of the shrine to purify the body, heart, and mind. Once this is complete they turn their focus to gaining the &quot;kami&#x27;s&quot; attention. The traditional method of doing this is to bow twice, clap twice and bow again, alerting the &quot;kami&quot; to their presence and desire to commune with them. During the last bow, the supplicant offers words of gratitude and praise to the &quot;kami&quot;; if they are offering a prayer for aid they will also state their name and address. After the prayer and/or worship they repeat the two bows, two claps and a final bow in conclusion.

Shinto practitioners also worship at home. This is done at a &quot;kamidana&quot; (household shrine), on which an &quot;ofuda&quot; with the name of their protector or ancestral &quot;kami&quot; is positioned. Their protector &quot;kami&quot; is determined by their or their ancestors&#x27; relationship to the &quot;kami&quot;.

Ascetic practices, shrine rituals and ceremonies, and Japanese festivals are the most public ways that Shinto devotees celebrate and offer adoration for the &quot;kami&quot;. &quot;Kami&quot; are celebrated during their distinct festivals that usually take place at the shrines dedicated to their worship. Many festivals involve believers, who are usually intoxicated, parading, sometimes running, toward the shrine while carrying mikoshi (portable shrines) as the community gathers for the festival ceremony. Yamamoto Guji, the high priest at the Tsubaki Grand Shrine, explains that this practice honors the &quot;kami&quot; because &quot;it is in the festival, the matsuri, the greatest celebration of life can be seen in the world of Shinto and it is the people of the community who attend festivals as groups, as a whole village who are seeking to unlock the human potential as children of kami&quot;. During the New Year Festival, families purify and clean their houses in preparation for the upcoming year. Offerings are also made to the ancestors so that they will bless the family in the future year.

Shinto ceremonies are so long and complex that in some shrines it can take ten years for the priests to learn them. The priesthood was traditionally hereditary. Some shrines have drawn their priests from the same families for over a hundred generations. It is not uncommon for the clergy to be female priestesses. The priests (&quot;kannushi&quot;) may be assisted by &quot;miko&quot;, young unmarried women acting as shrine maidens. Neither priests nor priestesses live as ascetics; in fact, it is common for them to be married, and they are not traditionally expected to meditate. Rather, they are considered specialists in the arts of maintaining the connection between the &quot;kami&quot; and the people.

In addition to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are the birth of a child and the Shichi-Go-San. When a child is born they are brought to a shrine so that they can be initiated as a new believer and the &quot;kami&quot; can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the &quot;kami&#x27;s&quot; protection and to pray for continued health.

Many other rites of passage are practiced by Shinto believers, and there are also many other festivals. The main reason for these ceremonies is so that Shinto followers can appease the &quot;kami&quot; in order to reach &quot;magokoro&quot;. &quot;Magokoro&quot; can only be received through the &quot;kami&quot;. Ceremonies and festivals are long and complex because they need to be perfect to satisfy the &quot;kami&quot;. If the &quot;kami&quot; are not pleased with these ceremonies, they will not grant a Shinto believer &quot;magokoro&quot;.

To avoid surveillance, the station&#x27;s inhabitants adopt an Aesopian language which is full of metaphors that are impossible for computers to grasp. The meaning of every sentence depended on the context. For example, &quot;I dreamt about blue angels last night&quot; means &quot;I was visited by the police last night.&quot;

The software that analyzes sentences is self-learning. Thus, a phrase that is used to describe something metaphorically should not be used again in the same context.

The &quot;ko-al&quot; in &quot;koalang&quot; derives from the Polish words &quot;kojarzeniowo-aluzyjny&quot; (&quot;associative-allusive&quot;). Zajdel paid tribute to George Orwell&#x27;s Newspeak and to Aldous Huxley by naming one of the main characters &quot;Nikor Orley Huxwell&quot;.

In the 1980s, the youth magazine &quot;Na Przełaj&quot; (&quot;Short Cut&quot;) printed rock lyrics in a column titled &quot;KOALANG&quot;, hinting that the songs&#x27; texts contained content camouflaged from censorship.

<text>Kobellite is a gray, fibrous, metallic mineral with the chemical formula . It is also a sulfide mineral consisting of antimony, bismuth, and lead. It is a member of the izoklakeite – berryite series with silver and iron substituting in the copper site and a varying ratio of bismuth, antimony, and lead. It crystallizes with monoclinic pyramidal crystals. The mineral can be found in ores and deposits of Hvena, Sweden; Ouray, Colorado; and Wake County, North Carolina, US. The mineral was named after Wolfgang Franz von Kobell (1803–1882), a German mineralogist.

<doc id="17383" wikidata="Q179246" url="?curid=17383" title="Kayak">
<text>A kayak is a small, narrow human-powered watercraft typically propelled by means of a long, double-bladed paddle. The word &quot;kayak&quot; originates from the Inuktitut word &quot;&quot; (). In British English, the kayak is also considered to be a kind of canoe.

There are countless different types of kayaks due to the craft being easily adaptable for different environments and purposes. The traditional kayak has an enclosed deck and one or more cockpits, each seating one occupant or kayaker, differentiating the craft from an open-deck canoe. The cockpit is sometimes covered by a spray deck that prevents unwanted entry of water from waves or splashes. Even within these confines, kayaks vary vastly in respect to materials, length, and width, with some kayaks such as the sprint kayak designed to be fast and light, and others such as the whitewater kayak designed to be sturdy and maneuverable.


Some modern paddlecrafts, which still claim the title &quot;kayak&quot;, remove integral parts of the traditional design; for instance, by eliminating the cockpit and seating the paddler on top of a canoe-like open deck, commonly known as a sit-on-top kayak. Other designs include inflated air chambers surrounding the craft; replacing the single hull with twin hulls; and replacing handheld paddles with other human-powered propulsion methods such as pedal-driven propeller and &quot;flippers&quot;. Some kayaks are also fitted with external sources of propulsion, such as a battery-powered electric motor to drive a propeller or flippers, a sail (which essentially modifies it into a sailboat), or even a completely independent gasoline outboard engine (which converts it into a &quot;de facto&quot; motorboat).

The kayak was first used by the indigenous Aleut, Inuit, Yupik and possibly Ainu people hunters in subarctic regions of the world.
== History ==


Kayaks (Inuktitut: &quot;qajaq&quot; (ᖃᔭᖅ ), Yup&#x27;ik: &quot;qayaq&quot; (from &quot;qai-&quot; &quot;surface; top&quot;), Aleut: &quot;Iqyax&quot;) were originally developed by the Inuit, Yup&#x27;ik, and Aleut. They used the boats to hunt on inland lakes, rivers and coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, North Atlantic, Bering Sea and North Pacific oceans. These first kayaks were constructed from stitched seal or other animal skins stretched over a wood or whalebone-skeleton frame. (Western Alaskan Natives used wood whereas the eastern Inuit used whalebone due to the treeless landscape). Kayaks are believed to be at least 4,000 years old. The oldest kayaks remaining are exhibited in the North America department of the State Museum of Ethnology in Munich, with the oldest dating from 1577.

Subarctic people made many types of boats for different purposes. The Aleut baidarka was made in double or triple cockpit designs, for hunting and transporting passengers or goods. An umiak is a large open-sea canoe, ranging from , made with seal skins and wood, originally paddled with single-bladed paddles and typically had more than one paddler.

Subarctic builders designed and built their boats based on their own experience and that of the generations before them passed on through oral tradition. The word &quot;kayak&quot; means &quot;man&#x27;s boat&quot; or &quot;hunter&#x27;s boat&quot;, and subarctic kayaks were a personal craft, each built by the man who used it and closely fitting his size for maximum maneuverability. For this reason, kayaks were often designed ergonomically using one&#x27;s own body proportions as units of measure. The paddler wore a tuilik, a garment that was stretched over the rim of the kayak coaming and sealed with drawstrings at the coaming, wrists, and hood edges. This enabled the &quot;eskimo roll&quot; and rescue to become the preferred methods of recovery after capsizing, especially as few Inuit could swim; their waters are too cold for a swimmer to survive for long.

Instead of a &quot;tuilik&quot;, most traditional kayakers today use a spray deck made of waterproof synthetic material stretchy enough to fit tightly around the cockpit rim and body of the kayaker, and which can be released rapidly from the cockpit to permit easy exit (in particular in a wet exit after a capsizing).

Inuit kayak builders had specific measurements for their boats. The length was typically three times the span of his outstretched arms. The width at the cockpit was the width of the builder&#x27;s hips plus two fists (sometimes less). The typical depth was his fist plus the outstretched thumb (hitch hiker). Thus typical dimensions were about long by wide by deep.

Traditional kayaks encompass three types: &quot;Baidarkas&quot;, from the Bering Sea &amp; Aleutian Islands, the oldest design, whose rounded shape and numerous chines give them an almost blimp-like appearance; &quot;West Greenland&quot; kayaks, with fewer chines and a more angular shape, with gunwales rising to a point at the bow and stern; and &quot;East Greenland&quot; kayaks that appear similar to the West Greenland style, but often fit more snugly to the paddler and possess a steeper angle between gunwale and , which lends maneuverability.

Most of the Aleut people in the Aleutian Islands eastward to Greenland Inuit relied on the kayak for hunting a variety of prey—primarily seals, though whales and caribou were important in some areas. Skin-on-frame kayaks are still being used for hunting by Inuit in Greenland, because the smooth and flexible skin glides silently through the waves.

==20th century &amp; contemporary kayaks==
Contemporary traditional-style kayaks trace their origins primarily to the native boats of Alaska, northern Canada, and Southwest Greenland. The use of fabric kayaks on wooden frames called a foldboat or folding kayak (German Faltboot or Hardernkahn) became widely popular in Europe beginning in 1907 when they were mass-produced by Johannes Klepper and others. This type of kayak was introduced to England and Europe by John MacGregor (sportsman) in 1860, but Klepper was the first person to mass-produce these boats made of collapsible wooden frames covered by waterproof rubberized canvas. By 1929, Klepper and Company were making 90 foldboats a day. Joined by other European manufacturers, by the mid-1930s there were an estimated half-million foldboat kayaks in use throughout Europe. First Nation masters of the roll taught this technique to Europeans during this time period.

These boats were tough and intrepid individuals were soon doing amazing things in them. In June 1928, a German named Franz Romer Sea kayak rigged his long foldboat with a sail and departed from Las Palmas in the Canary Islands carrying of tinned food and of water. Fifty-eight days and later he reached Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Another German, Oskar Speck, paddled his foldboat down the Danube and four years later reached the Australian coast after having traveled roughly 14,000 miles across the Pacific.

These watercraft were brought to the United States and used competitively in 1940 at the first National Whitewater Championship held in America near Middledam, Maine, on the Rapid River (Maine). One &quot;winner,&quot; Royal Little, crossed the finish line clinging to his overturned foldboat. Upstream, the river was &quot;strewn with many badly buffeted and some wrecked boats.&quot; Two women were in the competition, Amy Lang and Marjory Hurd. With her partner Ken Hutchinson, Hurd won the double canoe race. Lang won the doubles foldboat event with her partner, Alexander &quot;Zee&quot; Grant.

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Alexander &quot;Zee&quot; Grant was most likely America&#x27;s best foldboat pilot. Grant kayaked the Gates of Lodore on the Green River (Colorado River tributary) in Dinosaur National Monument in 1939 and the Middle Fork Salmon River in 1940. In 1941, Grant paddled a foldboat through Grand Canyon National Park. He outfitted his foldboat, named Escalante, with a sponson on each side of his boat and filled the boat with beach balls. As with nearly all American foldboat enthusiasts of the day, he did not know how to roll his boat.

Fiberglass mixed with resin composites, invented in the 1930s and 1940s, were soon used to make kayaks and this type of watercraft saw increased use during the 1950s, including in the US. Kayak Slalom World Champion Walter Kirschbaum built a fiberglass kayak and paddled it through Grand Canyon in June 1960. He knew how to roll and only swam once, in Hance Rapid (see List of Colorado River rapids and features). Like Grant&#x27;s foldboat, Kirschbaum&#x27;s fiberglass kayak had no seat and no thigh braces. In June 1987, Ed Gillet, using a stock off the shelf &quot;traditional design&quot; 20 foot long by 31 inch wide fiberglass tandem kayak paddled over 2,000 miles non-stop from Monterey, California to Hawaii, landing his vessel there on August 27, 1987, after 64 days of paddling. Gillet had navigated his kayak by using a traditional sextant and compass, along with approximately 600 pounds of food and water, including a device to convert sea water to fresh water. Within six days of reaching Hawaii, both he and his yellow kayak were featured on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, hosted by Johnny Carson.

Inflatable rubberized fabric boats were first introduced in Europe and rotomolded plastic kayaks first appeared in 1973. Most kayaks today are made from roto-molded polyethylene resins. The development of plastic and rubberized inflatable kayaks arguably initiated the development of freestyle kayaking as we see it today since these boats could be made smaller, stronger, and more resilient than fiberglass boats.

== Design principles ==
Typically, kayak design is largely a matter of trade-offs: directional stability (&quot;tracking&quot;) vs maneuverability; stability vs speed; and primary vs secondary stability. Multihull kayaks face a different set of trade-offs. The paddler&#x27;s body shape and size is an integral part of the structure, and will also affect the trade-offs made.

Attempting to lift and carry a kayak by oneself or improperly is a significant cause of kayaking injuries. Good lifting technique, sharing loads, and not using needlessly large and heavy kayaks prevent injuries.

=== Displacement ===
If the displacement of a kayak is not enough to support the passenger(s) and gear, it will sink. If the displacement is excessive, the kayak will float too high, catch the wind and waves uncomfortably, and handle poorly; it will probably also be bigger and heavier than it needs to be. Being excessively big will create more drag, and the kayak will move more slowly and take more effort. Rolling is easier in lower-displacement kayaks. On the other hand, a higher deck will keep the paddler(s) drier and make self-rescue and coming through surf easier. Many beginning paddlers who use a sit-in kayak feel more secure in a kayak with a weight capacity substantially more than their own weight. Maximum volume in a sit-in kayak is helped by a wide hull with high sides. But paddling ease is helped by lower sides where the paddler sits and a narrower width.

While the kayak&#x27;s buoyancy must be more than the loaded kayak, the optimal amount of excess buoyancy varies somewhat with kayak type, purpose, and personal taste (squirt boats, for instance, have very little positive buoyancy). Displacements vary with paddler weight. Most manufacturers include kayaks for paddlers weighing , with some kayaks for paddlers down to . Kayaks made for paddlers under are almost all very beamy and intended for beginners.

=== Length ===
As a general rule, a longer kayak is faster: it has a higher hull speed. It can also be narrower for a given displacement, reducing the drag, and it will generally track (follow a straight line) better than a shorter kayak. On the other hand, it is less maneuverable. Very long kayaks are less robust, and may be harder to store and transport. Some recreational kayak makers try to maximize hull volume (weight capacity) for a given length as shorter kayaks are easier to transport and store.

Kayaks that are built to cover longer distances such as touring and sea kayaks are longer, generally . With touring kayaks the keel is generally more defined (helping the kayaker track in a straight line). Whitewater kayaks, which generally depend upon river current for their forward motion, are short, to maximize maneuverability. These kayaks rarely exceed in length, and &quot;play boats&quot; may be only long. Recreational kayak designers try to provide more stability at the price of reduced speed, and compromise between tracking and maneuverability, ranging from .

=== Rocker ===

Length alone does not fully predict a kayak&#x27;s maneuverability: a second design element is &quot;rocker&quot;, i.e. its lengthwise curvature. A heavily &quot;rockered&quot; boat curves more, shortening its effective waterline. For example, an kayak with no rocker is in the water from end to end. In contrast, the bow and stern of a rockered boat are out of the water, shortening its lengthwise waterline to only . Rocker is generally most evident at the ends, and in moderation improves handling. Similarly, although a rockered whitewater boat may only be about a meter shorter than a typical recreational kayak, its waterline is far shorter and its maneuverability far greater. When surfing, a heavily rockered boat is less likely to lock into the wave as the bow and stern are still above water. A boat with less rocker cuts into the wave and makes it harder to turn while surfing.

=== Beam profile ===

The overall width of a kayak&#x27;s cross-section is its &quot;beam&quot;. A wide hull is more stable and packs more displacement into a shorter length. A narrow hull has less drag and is generally easier to paddle; in waves, it will ride more easily and stay dryer.

A narrower kayak makes a somewhat shorter paddle appropriate and a shorter paddle puts less strain on the shoulder joints. Some paddlers are comfortable with a sit-in kayak so narrow that their legs extend fairly straight out. Others want sufficient width to permit crossing their legs inside the kayak.

==== Types of stability ====
&quot;Primary&quot; (sometimes called &quot;initial&quot;) stability describes how much a boat tips, or rocks back and forth when displaced from level by paddler weight shifts. &quot;Secondary&quot; stability describes how stable a kayak feels when put on edge or when waves are passing under the hull perpendicular to the length of the boat. For kayak rolling, &quot;tertiary&quot; stability, or the stability of an upside-down kayak, is also important (lower tertiary stability makes rolling up easier).

Primary stability is often a big concern to a beginner, while secondary stability matters both to beginners and experienced travelers. By example, a wide, flat-bottomed kayak will have high primary stability and feel very stable on flat water. However, when a steep wave breaks on such a boat, it can be easily overturned because the flat bottom is no longer level. By contrast, a kayak with a narrower, more rounded hull with more hull flare can be edged or leaned into waves and (in the hands of a skilled kayaker) provides a safer, more comfortable response on stormy seas. Kayaks with only moderate primary, but excellent secondary stability are, in general, considered more seaworthy, especially in challenging conditions.
The shape of the cross section affects stability, maneuverability, and drag. Hull shapes are categorized by roundness, flatness, and by the presence and angle of chines. This cross-section may vary along the length of the boat.

A chine typically increases secondary stability by effectively widening the beam of the boat when it heels (tips). A V-shaped hull tends to travel straight (track) well but makes turning harder. V-shaped hulls also have the greatest secondary stability. Conversely, flat-bottomed hulls are easy to turn, but harder to direct in a constant direction. A round-bottomed boat has minimal area in contact with the water, and thus minimizes drag; however, it may be so unstable that it will not remain upright when floating empty, and needs continual effort to keep it upright. In a skin-on-frame kayak, chine placement may be constrained by the need to avoid the bones of the pelvis.

Sea kayaks, designed for open water and rough conditions, are generally narrower at and have more secondary stability than recreational kayaks, which are wider , and have a flatter hull shape and more primary stability.

==== Stability from body shape and skill level ====
The body of the paddler must also be taken into account. A paddler with a low center of gravity (COG) will find all boats more stable; for a paddler with a high center of gravity, all boats will feel tippier. On average, women have a lower COG than men. Women generally may fit a kayak about 10% narrower than the kayak that would fit a similarly sized man. Commercial kayaks made for women are rare. Unisex kayaks are built for men. Younger children have proportionately smaller and lighter bodies, but near-adult-size heads, and thus a higher center of gravity. A paddler with narrow shoulders will also want a narrower kayak.

Newcomers will often want a craft with high primary stability (see above). The southern method is a wider kayak. The West Greenland method is a removable pair of outriggers, lashed across the stern deck. Such an outrigger pair is often homemade of a small plank and found floats such as empty bottles or plastic ducks. Outriggers are also made commercially, especially for fishing kayaks and sailing. If the floats are set so that they are both in the water, they give primary stability, but produce more drag. If they are set so that they are both out of the water when the kayak is balanced, they give secondary stability.

=== Hull surface profile ===

Some kayak hulls are categorized according to the shape from bow to stern

Common shapes include:
* Symmetrical: the widest part of the boat is halfway between bow and stern.
* Fish form: the widest part is &quot;forward&quot; (in front) of the midpoint.
* Swede form: the widest part is &quot;aft&quot; (behind) midpoint.

=== Seating position and contact points ===

Traditional-style and some modern types of kayaks (e.g. sit-on-top) require that paddler be seated with their legs stretched in front of them, in a right angle, in a position called the &quot;L&quot; kayaking position. Other kayaks offer a different sitting position, in which the paddler&#x27;s legs are not stretched out in front of them, and the thigh brace bears more on the inside than the top of the thighs (see diagram).

A kayaker must be able to move the hull of their kayak by moving their lower body, and brace themselves against the hull (mostly with the feet) on each stroke. Most kayaks therefore have footrests and a backrest. Some kayaks fit snugly on the hips; others rely more on thigh braces. Mass-produced kayaks generally have adjustable bracing points. Many paddlers also customize their kayaks by putting in shims of closed-cell foam (usually EVA), or more elaborate structures, to make it fit more tightly.

Paddling puts substantial force through the legs, alternately with each stroke. The knees should therefore not be hyperextended. Separately, if the kneecap is in contact with the boat, or the knee joint is in torsion, this will cause pain and may injure the knee. Insufficient foot space will cause painful cramping and inefficient paddling. The paddler should generally be in a comfortable position.

== Materials and construction ==
Today almost all kayaks are commercial products intended for sale rather than for the builder&#x27;s personal use.

Fiberglass hulls are stiffer than polyethylene hulls, but they are more prone to damage from impact, including cracking. Most modern kayaks have steep V sections at the bow and stern, and a shallow V amidships. Fiberglass kayaks may be &quot;laid-up&quot; in a mold by hand, in which case they are usually more expensive than polyethylene kayaks, which are rotationally molded in a machine. The deck and hull are often made separately and then joined at a horizontal seam.
Plastic kayaks are rotationally molded (&#x27;rotomolded&#x27;) from a various grades and types of polyethylene resins ranging from soft to hard. Such kayaks are seamless and particularly resistant to impact, but heavy.
Inflatable kayaks are increasingly popular due to their ease of storage and transport, as well as the ability to be deflated for extended portage. Although slower than hardshell kayaks, many higher-end models often constructed of hypalon, as opposed to cheaper PVC designs, begin to approach the performance of traditional sea kayaks. Being inflatable they are virtually unsinkable and often more stable than hardshell designs. New drop-stitch technology means slab, rather than tube shapes are used in the designs with higher inflation pressures (up to ), leading to considerably faster, though often less stable kayaks which rival hardshell boats in performance.
Solid wooden hulls don&#x27;t necessarily require significant skill and handiwork, depending on how they are made. Three main types are popular, especially for the home builder: plywood stitch &amp; glue (S&amp;G), strip-built, and hybrids which have a stitch &amp; glue hull and a strip-built deck. Kayaks made from wood sheathed in fiberglass have proven successful, especially as the price of epoxy resin has decreased in recent years.

Stitch &amp; glue designs typically use modern, marine-grade plywood with a thickness of about . After cutting out the required pieces of hull and deck (kits often have these pre-cut), a series of small holes are drilled along the edges. Copper wire is then used to &quot;stitch&quot; the pieces together through the holes. After the pieces are temporarily stitched together, they are glued with epoxy and the seams reinforced with fiberglass. When the epoxy dries, the copper stitches are removed. Sometimes the entire boat is then covered in fiberglass for additional strength and waterproofing though this adds greatly to the weight and is unnecessary. Construction is fairly straightforward, but because plywood does not bend to form compound curves, design choices are limited. This is a good choice for the first-time kayak builder as the labor and skills required (especially for kit versions) is considerably less than for strip-built boats which can take three times as long to build.

Strip-built designs are similar in shape to rigid fiberglass kayaks but are generally both lighter and tougher. Like their fiberglass counterparts the shape and size of the boat determines performance and optimal uses. The hull and deck are built with thin strips of lightweight wood, often thuja (Western Red cedar), pine or redwood. The strips are edge-glued together around a form, stapled or clamped in place, and allowed to dry. Structural strength comes from a layer of fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin, layered inside and outside the hull. Strip–built kayaks are sold commercially by a few companies, priced US$4,000 and up. An experienced woodworker can build one for about US$400 in 200 hours, though the exact cost and time depend on the builder&#x27;s skill, the materials and the size and design. As a second kayak project, or for the serious builder with some woodworking expertise, a strip–built boat can be an impressive piece of work. Kits with pre-cut and milled wood strips are commercially available.

Skin-on-frame (SOF) boats are often more traditional in design, materials, and construction. They were traditionally made with driftwood frames, jointed, pegged, and lashed together, and covered with stretched seal skin, as those were the most readily available materials in the Arctic regions (other skins and baleen framing members were also used at need). A &quot;poor man&#x27;s kayak&quot; might be frameless and stuffed with a snow &quot;frame&quot;. Today, seal skin is usually replaced with canvas or nylon cloth covered with paint, polyurethane, or a hypalon rubber coating, on a wooden or aluminum frame. Modern skin-on-frame kayaks often possess greater impact resistance than their fiberglass counterparts, but are less durable against abrasion or sharp objects. They are often the lightest kayaks. Like the older skin-on-frame kayaks, they are often home-built to fit a specific paddler. Engineer Xyla Foxlin built a kayak out of transparent fibreglass as well as LEDs to create a floating vessel that lights up at night, which she calls the &quot;Rainbowt&quot;.
A special type of skin-on-frame kayak is the folding kayak. It has a collapsible frame, of wood, aluminum or plastic, or a combination thereof, and a skin of water-resistant and durable fabric. Many types have air sponsons built into the hull, making the kayak float even if flooded.

== Modern design ==
Most modern kayaks differ greatly from the original traditional subarctic kayaks in design, manufacturing and usage. They are often designed with computer-aided design (CAD) software, often in combination with CAD customized for naval design.

Modern kayaks serve diverse purposes, ranging from slow and easy touring on placid water, to racing and complex maneuvering in fast-moving whitewater, to fishing and long-distance ocean excursions. Modern forms, materials and construction techniques make it possible to effectively serve these needs while continuing to leverage the insights of the original Arctic inventors.

== Types ==

Modern kayaks have evolved into specialized types that may be broadly categorized according to their application as &quot;sea or touring kayaks&quot;, &quot;whitewater&quot; (or &quot;river&quot;) &quot;kayaks&quot;, &quot;surf kayaks&quot;, &quot;racing kayaks&quot;, &quot;fishing kayaks,&quot; and &quot;recreational&quot; kayaks. The broader kayak categories today are &#x27;sit-in&#x27; (SI), which is inspired mainly by traditional kayak forms, &#x27;sit-on-top&#x27; (SOT), which evolved from paddle boards that were outfitted with footrests and a backrest, &#x27;hybrid&#x27;, which are essentially canoes featuring a narrower beam and a reduced free board enabling the paddler to propel them from the middle of the boat, using a double blade paddle (i.e. &#x27;kayak paddle&#x27;), and twin hull kayaks offering each of the paddler&#x27;s legs a narrow hull of its own.
In recent decades, kayaks design have proliferated to a point where the only broadly accepted denominator for them is their being designed mainly for paddling using a kayak paddle featuring two blades i.e. &#x27;kayak paddle&#x27;. However, even this inclusive definition is being challenged by other means of human powered propulsion, such as foot activated pedal drives combined with rotating or sideways moving propellers, electric motors, and even outboard motors.

=== Recreational ===
Recreational kayaks are designed for the casual paddler interested in fishing, photography, or a peaceful paddle on a lake, flatwater stream or protected salt water away from strong ocean waves. These boats presently make up the largest segment of kayak sales. Compared to other kayaks, recreational kayaks have a larger cockpit for easier entry and exit and a wider beam () for more stability. They are generally less than in length and have limited cargo capacity. Less expensive materials like polyethylene and fewer options keep these boats relatively inexpensive. Most canoe/kayak clubs offer introductory instruction in recreational boats. They do not perform as well in the sea. The recreational kayak is usually a type of touring kayak.

&quot;Sea kayaks&quot; are typically designed for travel by one, two or even three paddlers on open water and in many cases trade maneuverability for seaworthiness, stability, and cargo capacity. Sea-kayak sub-types include &quot;skin-on-frame&quot; kayaks with traditionally constructed frames, open-deck &quot;sit-on-top&quot; kayaks, and recreational kayaks.

The sea kayak, though descended directly from traditional types, is implemented in a variety of materials. Sea kayaks typically have a longer waterline, and provisions for below-deck storage of cargo. Sea kayaks may also have rudders or skegs (fixed rudder) and upturned bow or stern profiles for wave shedding. Modern sea kayaks usually have two or more internal bulkheads. Some models can accommodate two or sometimes three paddlers.

==== Sit-on-top ====


Sealed-hull (&quot;unsinkable&quot;) craft were developed for leisure use, as derivatives of surfboards (e.g. paddle or wave skis), or for surf conditions. Variants include planing surf craft, touring kayaks, and sea marathon kayaks. Increasingly, manufacturers build leisure &#x27;sit-on-top&#x27; variants of extreme sports craft, typically using polyethylene to ensure strength and affordability, often with a skeg for directional stability.

Sit-on-top kayaks come in 1–4 paddler configurations. Sit-on-top kayaks are particularly popular for fishing and SCUBA diving, since participants need to easily enter and exit the water, change seating positions, and access hatches and storage wells. Ordinarily the seat of a sit-on-top is slightly above water level, so the center of gravity for the paddler is higher than in a traditional kayak. To compensate for the higher center of gravity, sit-on-tops are often wider and slower than a traditional kayak of the same length.

Water that enters the cockpit of a sit-on-top kayak drains out through scupper holes—tubes that run from the cockpit to the bottom of the hull. The &quot;cockpit&quot; is thus self-bailing. The hull may be sealed, or perforated by hatches and deck fixtures. Contrary to popular belief, the sit-on-top kayak &quot;hull&quot; is not self-bailing, since water penetrating it does not drain out automatically, as it does in bigger boats equipped with self-bailing systems. Furthermore, the sit-on-top hull cannot be molded in a way that would assure water tightness, and water may get in through various holes in its hull, usually around hatches and deck accessories. If the sit-on-top kayak is loaded to a point where such perforations are covered with water, or if the water paddled is rough enough that such perforations often go under water, the sit-on-top hull may fill with water without the paddler noticing it in time. If a sealed hull develops a split or hole, it will also fill and sink.

=== Surf ===
Specialty surf boats typically have flat bottoms, and hard edges, similar to surf boards. The design of a surf kayak promotes the use of an ocean surf wave (moving wave) as opposed to a river or feature wave (moving water). They are typically made from rotomolded plastic, or fiberglass.

Surf kayaking comes in two main varieties, High Performance (HP) and International Class (IC). High Performance boats tend to have a lot of nose rocker, little to no tail rocker, flat hulls, sharp rails and up to four fins set up as either a three fin thruster or a quad fin. This enables them to move at high speed and maneuver dynamically. International Class boats have to be at least long and until a recent rule change had to have a hull; now flat and slightly hulls are also allowed, although fins are not. Surfing on international boats tends to be smoother and more flowing, and they are thought of as kayaking&#x27;s &quot;long boarding&quot;. Surf boats come in a variety of materials ranging from tough but heavy plastics to super light, super stiff but fragile foam–cored carbon fiber. Surf kayaking has become popular in traditional surfing locations, as well as new locations such as the Great Lakes.

==== Waveskis ====
A variation on the closed-cockpit surf kayak is called a waveski. Although the waveski offers dynamics similar to a sit–on–top, its paddling technique and surfing performance and construction can be similar to surfboard designs.

=== Whitewater ===

Whitewater kayaks are rotomolded in a semi-rigid, high impact plastic, usually polyethylene. Careful construction ensures that the boat remains structurally sound when subjected to fast-moving water. The plastic hull allows these kayaks to bounce off rocks without leaking, although they scratch and eventually puncture with enough use. Whitewater kayaks range from long. There are two main types of whitewater kayak, playboats and river-running boats. Creekboats (for small rivers) and squirt boats are more specialized.

==== Playboat ====
One type, the &quot;playboat&quot;, is short, with a scooped bow and blunt stern. These trade speed and stability for high maneuverability. Their primary use is performing tricks in individual water features or short stretches of river. In playboating or &quot;freestyle&quot; competition (also known as &quot;rodeo&quot; boating), kayakers exploit the complex currents of rapids to execute a series of tricks, which are scored for skill and style.

==== Creekboats and river-running kayaks ====
The other primary type is the creek boat, which gets its name from its purpose: running narrow, low-volume waterways. Creekboats are longer and have far more volume than playboats, which makes them more stable, faster and higher-floating. Many paddlers use creekboats in &quot;short boat&quot; downriver races, and they are often seen on large rivers where their extra stability and speed may be necessary to get through rapids.

Between the creekboat and playboat extremes is a category called &quot;river–running&quot; kayaks. These medium–sized boats are designed for rivers of moderate to high volume, and some, known as &quot;river running playboats&quot;, are capable of basic playboating moves. They are typically owned by paddlers who do not have enough whitewater involvement to warrant the purchase of more–specialized boats.

==== Squirt boats ====
Squirt boating involves paddling both on the surface of the river and underwater. Squirt boats must be custom-fitted to the paddler to ensure comfort while maintaining the low interior volume necessary to allow the paddler to submerge completely in the river.

=== Racing ===

==== Whitewater ====
White water racers combine a fast, unstable lower hull portion with a flared upper hull portion to combine flat water racing speed with extra stability in open water: they are not fitted with rudders and have similar maneuverability to flat water racers. They usually require substantial skill to achieve stability, due to extremely narrow hulls. Whitewater racing kayaks, like all racing kayaks, are made to regulation lengths, usually of fiber reinforced resin (usually epoxy or polyester reinforced with Kevlar, glass fiber, carbon fiber, or some combination). This form of construction is stiffer and has a harder skin than non-reinforced plastic construction such as rotomolded polyethylene: stiffer means faster, and harder means fewer scratches and therefore also faster.

==== Flatwater sprint ====
Sprint kayak is a sport held on calm water. Crews or individuals race over 200 m, 500 m, 1000 m or 5000 m with the winning boat being the first to cross the finish line. The paddler is seated, facing forward, and uses a double-bladed paddle pulling the blade through the water on alternate sides to propel the boat forward. In competition the number of paddlers within a boat is indicated by a figure besides the type of boat; K1 signifies an individual kayak race, K2 pairs, and K4 four-person crews. Kayak sprint has been in every summer olympics since it debuted at the 1936 summer olympics. Racing is governed by the International Canoe Federation.

==== Slalom ====

Slalom kayaks are flat–hulled, and—since the early 1970s—feature low profile decks. They are highly maneuverable, and stable but not fast in a straight line.

==== Surfskis ====
A specialized variant of racing craft called a &quot;surf ski&quot; has an open cockpit and can be up to long but only wide, requiring expert balance and paddling skill. Surf skis were originally created for surf and are still used in races in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. They have become popular in the United States for ocean races, lake races and even downriver races.

==== Marathon ====
Marathon races vary in distances from ten kilometres to over 1000 kilometres for multi-day stage races.

=== Specialty and hybrids ===
The term &quot;kayak&quot; is increasingly applied to craft that look little like traditional kayaks.

==== Inflatable ====


Inflatables, also known as the &quot;duckies&quot; or &quot;IKs&quot;, can usually be transported by hand using a carry bag. They are generally made of hypalon (a kind of neoprene), nitrilon (nitrile-rubberized fabric), PVC, or polyurethane-coated cloth. They can be inflated with foot, hand or electric pumps. Multiple compartments in all but the least expensive increase safety. They generally use low pressure air, almost always below .

While many inflatables are non-rigid, essentially pointed rafts, best suited for use on rivers and calm water, the higher-end inflatables are designed to be hardy, seaworthy vessels. Recently some manufacturers have added an internal frame (folding-style) to a multi-section inflatable sit-on-top kayak to produce a seaworthy boat. Fully drop-stitch inflatable kayaks are also available, which are inflated to 8–10 PSI. They are much stiffer, which enhances their paddling characteristics to vastly outperform traditional inflatable kayaks.

The appeal of inflatable kayaks is their portability, their durability (they don&#x27;t dent), ruggedness in white water (they bounce off rocks rather than break) and their easy storage. In addition, inflatable kayaks generally are stable, have a small turning radius and are easy to master, although some models take more effort to paddle and are slower than traditional kayaks.

Because inflatable kayaks aren&#x27;t as sturdy as traditional, hard-shelled kayaks, a lot of people tend to steer away from them. However, there have been considerable advancements in inflatable kayak technology over recent years.

==== Folding ====
Folding kayaks are direct descendants of the skin-on-frame boats used by the Inuit and Greenlandic peoples. Modern folding kayaks are constructed from a wooden or aluminum frame over which is placed a synthetic skin made of polyester, cotton canvas, polyurethane, or Hypalon. They are more expensive than inflatable kayaks, but have the advantage of greater stiffness and consequently better seaworthiness.

Walter Höhn (English Hoehn) had built, developed and then tested his design for a folding kayak in the white-water rivers of Switzerland from 1924 to 1927. In 1928, on emigrating to Australia, he brought 2 of them with him, lodged a patent for the design and proceeded to manufacture them.
In 1942 the Australian Director of Military operations approached him to develop them for Military use. Orders were placed and eventually a total of 1024, notably the MKII &amp; MKIII models, were produced by him and another enterprise, based on his 1942 patent (No. 117779)

==== Pedal ====

Pedal kayaks represent a pioneering type of watercraft engineered for hands-free functionality, utilizing a propulsion system operated by the kayaker&#x27;s feet. This mechanism usually consists of pedals that are rotated in a circular motion, akin to bicycling, generating forward momentum through a propeller or fins situated beneath the kayak. Steering is managed by a rudder or steering mechanism, typically operated by a hand lever or supplementary foot pedals for directional control.

==== Twin hull and outrigger ====
Traditional multi-hull vessels such as catamarans and outrigger canoes benefit from increased lateral stability without sacrificing speed, and these advantages have been successfully applied in twin hull kayaks. &quot;Outrigger kayaks&quot; attach one or two smaller hulls to the main hull to enhance stability, especially for fishing, touring, kayak sailing and motorized kayaking.
Twin hull kayaks feature two long and narrow hulls, and since all their buoyancy is distributed as far as possible from their center line, they are more stable than mono hull kayaks outfitted with outriggers.

=== Fishing ===

While native people of the Arctic regions hunted rather than fished from kayaks, in recent years kayak sport fishing has become popular in both fresh and salt water, especially in warmer regions. Traditional fishing kayaks are characterized by wide beams of up to that increase their lateral stability. Some are equipped with outriggers that increase their stability, and others feature twin hulls enabling stand up paddling and fishing. Compared with motorboats, fishing kayaks are inexpensive and have few maintenance costs. Many kayak anglers like to customize their kayaks for fishing, a process known as &#x27;rigging&#x27;.

=== Military ===

Kayaks were adapted for military use in the Second World War. Used mainly by British Commandos and special forces, principally the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties (COPPs), the Special Boat Service and the Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment. The latter made perhaps the best known use of them in the Operation Frankton raid on Bordeaux harbor. Both the Special Air Service (SAS) and the Special Boat Service (SBS) used kayaks for reconnaissance in the 1982 Falklands War. US Navy SEALs reportedly used them at the start of Unified Task Force operations in Somalia in 1992. The SBS currently use Klepper two-person folding kayaks that can be launched from surfaced submarines or carried to the surface by divers from submerged ones. They can be parachuted from transport aircraft at sea or dropped from the back of Chinook helicopters. US Special Forces have used Kleppers but now primarily use Long Haul folding kayaks, which are made in the US.

The Australian Military MKII and MKIII folding kayaks were extensively used during WWII in the Pacific Theater for some 33 raids and missions on and around the South-East Asian islands. Documentation for this will be found in the National Archives of Australia official records, reference No. NAA K1214-123/1/06. They were deployed from disguised watercraft, submarines, Catalina aircraft, P.T. boats, motor launches and by parachute.

<text>The Imperial German Navy or the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) was the navy of the German Empire, which existed between 1871 and 1919. It grew out of the small Prussian Navy (from 1867 the North German Federal Navy), which was mainly for coast defence. Kaiser Wilhelm II greatly expanded the navy. The key leader was Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, who greatly expanded the size and quality of the navy, while adopting the sea power theories of American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. The result was a naval arms race with Britain, as the German navy grew to become one of the greatest maritime forces in the world, second only to the Royal Navy.

The German surface navy proved ineffective during the First World War; its only major engagement, the Battle of Jutland, was a draw, but it kept the surface fleet largely in port for the rest of the war. The submarine fleet was greatly expanded and threatened the British supply system during the U-boat campaign. As part of the Armistice, the Imperial Navy&#x27;s main ships were ordered to be turned over to the Allies but they were instead scuttled by their own crews. All ships of the Imperial Navy bore the title &quot;SMS&quot;, for (His Majesty&#x27;s Ship).

==Achievements==
The Imperial Navy achieved some important operational feats. At the Battle of Coronel, it inflicted the first major defeat on the Royal Navy in over one hundred years, although the German squadron of ships was subsequently defeated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands, only one ship escaping destruction. The Navy also emerged from the fleet action of the Battle of Jutland having destroyed more ships than it lost, although the strategic value of both of these encounters was minimal.

The Imperial Navy was the first to operate submarines successfully on a large scale in wartime, with 375 submarines commissioned by the end of the First World War, and it also operated zeppelins. Although it was never able to match the number of ships of the Royal Navy, it had technological advantages, such as better shells and propellant for much of the Great War, meaning that it never lost a ship to a catastrophic magazine explosion from an above-water attack, although the elderly pre-dreadnought sank rapidly at Jutland after a magazine explosion was caused by an underwater attack.

==1871 to 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm I==
The unification of Germany under Prussian leadership was the defining point for the creation of the Imperial Navy in 1871. The newly created emperor, Wilhelm I, as King of Prussia, had previously been head of state of the strongest state forming part of the new empire. The navy remained the same as that operated by the empire&#x27;s predecessor organisation in the unification of Germany, the North German Confederation, which itself in 1867 had inherited the navy of the Kingdom of Prussia. Article 53 of the new Empire&#x27;s constitution recognised the existence of the Navy as an independent organisation, but until 1888 it was commanded by army officers and initially adopted the same regulations as the Prussian army. Supreme command was vested in the emperor, but its first appointed chief was (General of the Infantry) Albrecht von Stosch. Kiel on the Baltic Sea and Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea served as the Navy&#x27;s principal naval bases. The former Navy Ministry became the Imperial Admiralty on 1 February 1872, while Stosch became formally an admiral in 1875. Initially the main task of the new Imperial Navy was coastal protection, with France and Russia seen as Germany&#x27;s most likely future enemies. The Imperial Navy&#x27;s tasks were then to prevent any invasion force from landing and to protect coastal towns from possible bombardment.

In March 1872 a German Imperial Naval Academy was created at Kiel for training officers, followed in May by the creation of a &#x27;Machine Engineer Corps&#x27;, and in February 1873 a &#x27;Medical Corps&#x27;. In July 1879 a separate &#x27;Torpedo Engineer Corps&#x27; was created dealing with torpedoes and mines.

In May 1872 a ten-year building programme was instituted to modernise the fleet. This called for eight armoured frigates, six armoured corvettes, twenty light corvettes, seven monitors, two floating batteries, six avisos, eighteen gunboats and twenty-eight torpedo boats, at an estimated cost of 220 million gold marks. The building plan had to be approved by the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, which controlled the allocation of funds, although one-quarter of the money came from French war reparations.

In 1883 Stosch was replaced by another general, Count Leo von Caprivi. At this point the navy had seven armoured frigates and four armoured corvettes, 400 officers and 5,000 ratings. The objectives of coastal defence remained largely unchanged, but there was a new emphasis on development of the torpedo, which offered the possibility of relatively small ships successfully attacking much larger ones. In October 1887 the first torpedo division was created at Wilhelmshaven and the second torpedo division based at Kiel. In 1887 Caprivi requested the construction of ten armoured frigates.

Greater importance was placed at this time on development of the army, which was expected to be more important in any war. However, the Kiel Canal was commenced in June 1887, which connected the North Sea with the Baltic through the Jutland peninsula, allowing German ships to travel between the two seas avoiding waters controlled by other countries. This shortened the journey for commercial ships, but specifically united the two areas principally of concern to the German navy, at a cost of 150 million marks.

Later, the protection of German maritime trade routes became important. This soon involved the setting up of some overseas supply stations, so called &quot;Auswärtige Stationen&quot; (foreign stations) and in the 1880s the Imperial Navy played a part in helping to secure the establishment of German colonies and protectorates in Africa, Asia and Oceania.

==1888 to 1897, under Kaiser Wilhelm II==

In June 1888 Wilhelm II became Emperor after the death of his father Frederick III, who ruled for only 99 days. He started his reign with the intention of doing for the navy what his grandfather Wilhelm I had done for the army. The creation of a maritime empire to rival the British and French empires became an ambition to mark Germany as a truly global great power. Wilhelm became Grand Admiral of the German Navy, but also was awarded honorific titles from all over Europe, becoming admiral in the British, Russian, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Austro-Hungarian and Greek navies. On one occasion he wore the uniform of a British admiral to receive the visiting British ambassador. At this time the Imperial Navy had 534 officers and 15,480 men.

The concept of expanding naval power, inevitably at the cost of not expanding other forces, was opposed by the three successive heads of the German armed forces, Waldersee, Schlieffen and Moltke between 1888 and 1914. It would also have been more widely opposed, had the Kaiser&#x27;s intentions been widely known. Instead, he proceeded with a plan to expand the navy slowly, justifying enlargement step by step.

In July 1888 Wilhelm II appointed Vice-Admiral Alexander von Monts as head of the admiralty. Monts oversaw the design of the , four of which were constructed by 1894 at a cost of 16 million marks each and displacement of 10,000 tons.

In 1889 Wilhelm II reorganised top level control of the navy by creating a Navy Cabinet (&quot;Marine-Kabinett&quot;) equivalent to the German Imperial Military Cabinet which had previously functioned in the same capacity for both the army and navy. The Head of the navy cabinet was responsible for promotions, appointments, administration and issuing orders to naval forces. Captain Gustav von Senden-Bibran was appointed as its first head and remained so until 1906, when he was replaced by the long-serving Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller. The existing Imperial admiralty was abolished and its responsibilities divided between two organisations. A new position of Chief of the Imperial Naval High Command was created, being responsible for ship deployments, strategy and tactics, an equivalent to the supreme commander of the Army. Vice admiral Max von der Goltz was appointed in 1889 and remained in post until 1895. Construction and maintenance of ships and obtaining supplies was the responsibility of the State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office (&quot;Reichsmarineamt&quot;), responsible to the chancellor and advising the Reichstag on naval matters. The first appointee was Rear Admiral Karl Eduard Heusner, followed shortly by Rear Admiral Friedrich von Hollmann from 1890 to 1897. Each of these three heads of department reported separately to Wilhelm II.

In 1895 funding was agreed for five battleships of the , completed by 1902. The ships were innovative for their time, introducing a complex system of watertight compartments and storing coal along the sides of the ship to help absorb explosions. However, the ships went against the trend for increasingly larger main guns, having smaller diameter guns than the &quot;Brandenburg&quot; design, but with a quick-loading design and more powerful secondary armaments. Costs rose to 21 million marks each, as had size to 11,500 tons.

In 1892 Germany had launched the protected cruiser , the first navy ship to have triple propellers. She was succeeded by five protected cruisers, the last &#x27;protected&#x27;, as distinct from &#x27;armoured&#x27; cruiser class constructed by Germany. The ships, completed between 1898 and 1900, had deck armour but not side armour and were intended for overseas duties. Shortages of funding meant it was not possible to create several designs of cruisers specialised for long range work, or more heavily armoured for fleet work. Work commenced on an armoured cruiser design, started in 1896 and commissioned in 1900.

==1897 to 1906, Tirpitz and the Navy bills==

On 18 June 1897 Rear-Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was appointed State Secretary of the Navy, where he remained for nineteen years. Tirpitz advocated the cause of an expanded navy necessary for Germany to defend her territories abroad. He had great success in persuading parliament to pass successive Navy bills authorising expansions of the fleet. German foreign policy as espoused by Otto von Bismarck had been to deflect the interest of great powers abroad while Germany consolidated her integration and military strength. Now Germany was to compete with the rest. Tirpitz started with a publicity campaign aimed at popularising the navy. He created popular magazines about the navy, arranged for Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot;, which argued the importance of naval forces, to be translated into German and serialised in newspapers, arranged rallies in support and invited politicians and industrialists to naval reviews. Various pressure groups were formed to lobby politicians and spread publicity. One such organisation, the navy league or &quot;Flottenverein&quot;, was organized by principals in the steel industry (Alfred Krupp), ship yards and banks, gaining more than one million members. Political parties were offered concessions, such as taxes on imported grain, in exchange for their support for naval bills.

On 10 April 1898 the first Navy Bill was passed by the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. It authorised the maintenance of a fleet of 19 battleships, 8 armoured cruisers, 12 large cruisers and 30 light cruisers to be constructed by 1 April 1904. Existing ships were counted in the total, but the bill provided for ships to be replaced every 25 years on an indefinite basis. Five million marks annually was allocated to run the navy, with a total budget of 408 million marks for shipbuilding. This would bring the German fleet to a strength where it could contemplate challenging France or Russia, but would remain clearly inferior to the world&#x27;s largest fleet, the Royal Navy.

Following the Boxer Rebellion in China and the Boer War, a second navy bill was passed on 14 June 1900. This approximately doubled the allocated number of ships to 38 battleships, 20 armoured cruisers, 38 light cruisers. Significantly, the bill set no overall cost limit for the building program. Expenditure for the navy was too great to be met from taxation: the Reichstag had limited powers to extend taxation without entering into negotiations with the constituent German states, and this was considered politically unviable. Instead, the bill was financed by massive loans. Tirpitz, in 1899 was already exploring the possibilities for extending the battleship total to 45, a target which rose to 48 by 1909.
Tirpitz&#x27;s ultimate goal was a fleet capable of rivaling the Royal Navy. As British public opinion was turned against Germany, Admiral Sir John Fisher twice – in 1904 and 1908 – proposed using Britain&#x27;s current naval superiority to &#x27;Copenhagen&#x27; the German fleet, that is, to launch pre-emptive strikes against the Kiel and Wilhelmshaven naval bases as the Royal Navy had done against the Danish navy in 1801 and 1807.&quot; Tirpitz argued that if the fleet could achieve two-thirds the number of capital ships possessed by Britain then it stood a chance of winning in a conflict. Britain had to maintain a fleet throughout the world and consider other naval powers, whereas the German fleet could be concentrated in German waters. Attempts were made to play down the perceived threat to Britain, but once the German fleet reached the position of equalling the other second-rank navies, it became impossible to avoid mention of the one great fleet it was intended to challenge. Tirpitz hoped that other second-rank powers might ally with Germany, attracted by its navy. The policy of commencing what amounted to a naval arms race did not properly consider how Britain might respond. British policy, stated in the Naval Defence Act of 1889, was to maintain a navy superior to Britain&#x27;s two largest rivals combined. The British Admiralty estimated that the German navy would be the world&#x27;s second largest by 1906.

Major reforms of the Royal Navy were undertaken, particularly by Fisher as First Sea Lord from 1904 to 1909. 154 older ships, including 17 battleships, were scrapped to make way for newer vessels. Reforms in training and gunnery were introduced to make good perceived deficiencies, which in part Tirpitz had counted upon to provide his ships with a margin of superiority. More capital ships were stationed in British home waters. A treaty with Japan in 1902 meant that ships could be withdrawn from East Asia, while the &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; with France in 1904 meant that Britain could concentrate on guarding Channel waters, including the French coast, while France would protect British interests in the Mediterranean. By 1906 it was considered that Britain&#x27;s only likely naval enemy was Germany.
Five battleships of the were constructed from 1899 to 1904 at a cost of 22 million marks per ship. Five ships of the were built between 1901 and 1906 for the slightly greater 24 million marks each. Technological improvements meant that rapid fire guns could be made larger, so the &quot;Braunschweig&quot; class had a main armament of guns. Due to torpedo improvements in range and accuracy, emphasis was placed on a secondary armament of smaller guns to defend against them. The five s constructed between 1903 and 1908 had similar armament as the &quot;Braunschweig&quot; class, but heavier armour, for the slightly greater sum of 24.5 million marks each.

Development of armoured cruisers also continued. &quot;Fürst Bismarck&quot;″s design was improved upon in the subsequent , completed in 1902. Two ships of the were commissioned in 1904, followed by two similar armoured cruisers commissioned in 1905 and 1906, at costs around 17 million marks each. and followed, between 1904 and 1908, and cost an estimated for 20.3 million marks. Main armament was eight guns, but with six and eighteen guns for smaller targets. Eight light cruisers were constructed between 1902 and 1907, developed from the earlier . The ships had ten guns and were named after German towns. was the first German cruiser to be fitted with turbine engines, which were also trialled in torpedo boat &quot;S-125&quot;. Turbines were faster, quieter, lighter, more reliable and more fuel efficient at high speeds. The first British experimental design (the destroyer ) had been constructed in 1901 and as a result Tirpitz had set up a special commission to develop turbines. No reliable German design was available by 1903, so British Parsons turbines were purchased.

===Command reorganisation===
In 1899, the Imperial Naval High Command was replaced by the German Imperial Admiralty Staff (&quot;Admiralstab&quot;) responsible for planning, the training of officers, and naval intelligence. In time of war it was to assume overall command, but in peace acted only advisory. Direct control of various elements of the fleet was subordinated to officers commanding those elements, accountable to the Kaiser.

The reorganisations suited the Kaiser who wanted to maintain direct control of his ships. A disadvantage was that it split apart the integrated military command structure which before had balanced the importance of the navy within overall defence considerations. It suited Alfred von Tirpitz, because it removed the influence of the admiralty staff from naval planning, but left him the possibility, in wartime, to reorganise command around himself. Wilhelm II, however, never agreed to relinquish direct control of his fleet.

==1906 to 1908, the Dreadnought and innovation: First &quot;Novelle&quot;==
On 3 December 1906 the Royal Navy received a new battleship, . She became famous as the first of a new concept in battleship design, using all big gun, single size of calibre armament. She used turbine propulsion for greater speed and less space required by the machinery, and guns arranged so that three times as many could be brought to bear when firing ahead, and twice as many when firing broadside. The design was not a uniquely British concept as similar ships were being built around the world, nor was it uniquely intended as a counter to German naval expansion, but the effect was to immediately require Germany to reconsider its naval building program. The battleship design was complemented by the introduction of a variant with lighter armour and greater speed, which became the battlecruiser.

The revolution in design, together with improvements in personnel and training severely brought into question the German assumption that a fleet of two-thirds the size of the Royal Navy would at least stand a chance in an engagement. By 1906 Germany was already spending 60% of revenue upon the army. Either an enormous sum now had to be found to develop the navy further, or naval expansion had to be abandoned. The decision to continue was taken by Tirpitz in September 1905 and agreed by Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow and the Kaiser, while &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was still at the planning stage. The larger ships would naturally be more expensive, but also would require enlargement of harbours, locks and the Kiel canal, all of which would be enormously expensive. Estimated cost for new dreadnoughts was placed at 36.5 million marks for 19,000 tons displacement ships (larger than &quot;Dreadnought&quot; at 17,900 tons), and 27.5 million marks for battle-cruisers. 60 million mark was allocated for dredging the canal. The Reichstag was persuaded to agree to the program and passed a &quot;Novelle&quot; (a supplementary law) amending the navy bills and allocating 940 million marks for a dreadnought program and the necessary infrastructure. Two dreadnoughts and one battlecruiser were to be built each year.
Construction of four s began in 1907 under the greatest possible secrecy. The chief German naval designer was Hans Bürkner. A principle was introduced that the thickness of side armour on a ship would equal the calibre of the large guns, while ships were increasingly divided internally into watertight compartments to make them more resistant to flooding when damaged. The design was hampered by the necessity to use reciprocating engines instead of the smaller turbines, since no sufficiently powerful design was available and acceptable to the German navy. Turrets could not be placed above the centre of the ship and instead had to be placed at the side, meaning two of the six turrets would always be on the wrong side of the ship when firing broadsides. Main armament was twelve 28 cm guns. The ships were all completed by 1910, over budget, averaging 37.4 million marks each. In 1910 they were transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven, where two new large docks had been completed and more were under construction.

The first German battlecruiser——was commenced March 1908. Four Parsons turbines were used, improving speed to 27 knots and reducing weight. Four twin turrets mounted 28 cm guns; although the two centre turrets were still placed one either side of the ship, they were offset so could now fire either side. The design was considered a success, but the cost at 35.5 million marks was significantly above the 1906 allocation. Light cruiser development continued with the light cruisers, which were to become famous for their actions in the start of World War I in the Pacific. The ships were 3,300 tons, and armed with ten 10.5 cm rapid fire guns and a speed around 24 knots. cost 7.5 million marks, and 6 million marks. Four were produced between 1907 and 1911 at 4,400 tons and around 8 million marks each. These had turbines, twelve 10.5 cm guns as main armament, but were also equipped to carry and lay 100 mines. From 1907 onward, all torpedo boats were constructed using turbine engines.

Despite their ultimate importance, the German navy declined to take up the cause of another experiment, the submarine, until 1904. The first submarine, was delivered in December 1906, built by Krupp&#x27;s Germania yard in Kiel. The first submarine had 238 ton displacement on the surface and 283 tons submerged. The kerosene engine developed 10 knots on the surface with a range of . Submerged, the ship could manage 50 nautical miles at 5 knots using battery electric propulsion. The ships followed a design by Maxime Laubeuf first used successfully in 1897, having a double hull and flotation tanks around the outside of the main crew compartments. The submarine had just one torpedo tube at the front and a total of three torpedoes. The early engines were noisy and smoky, so that a considerable boost to the usefulness of the submarine came with the introduction of quieter and cleaner diesel engines in 1910, which were much more difficult for an enemy to detect.

==1908 to 1912, Second &quot;Novelle&quot;==
German expenditure on ships was steadily rising. In 1907, 290 million marks was spent on the fleet, rising to 347 million marks or 24 percent of the national budget in 1908, with a predicted budget deficit of 500 million marks. By the outbreak of World War I, one billion marks had been added to Germany&#x27;s national debt because of naval expenditures. While each German ship was more expensive than the last, the British managed to reduce the cost of the succeeding generations of (3 ships) and (3) battleships. Successive British battlecruisers were more expensive, but less so than their German equivalents. Overall, German ships were some 30% more expensive than the British. This all contributed to growing opposition in the Reichstag to any further expansion, particularly when it was clear that Britain intended to match and exceed any German expansion program. In the fleet itself, complaints were beginning to be made in 1908 about underfunding and shortages of crews for the new ships. The State Secretary of the Treasury, Hermann von Stengel, resigned because he could see no way to resolve the budget deficit.

The elections of 1907 had returned a &quot;Reichstag&quot; more favourable to military exploits, following the refusal of the previous parliament to grant funds to suppress uprisings in colonies in German South-West Africa. Despite the difficulties, Tirpitz persuaded the Reichstag to pass a further &quot;Novelle&quot; in March 1908. This reduced the service life for ships from 25 years to 20 years, allowing for faster modernisation, and increased the building rate to four capital ships per year. Tirpitz&#x27;s target was a fleet of 16 battleships and 5 battlecruisers by 1914, and 38 battleships and 20 battlecruisers by 1920. There were also to be 38 light cruisers, and 144 torpedo boats. The bill contained a restriction, that building would fall to two ships per year in 1912, but Tirpitz was confident of changing this at a later date. He anticipated that German industry, now heavily involved in shipbuilding, would back a campaign to maintain a higher construction rate.

Four battleships of the were laid down in 1909–10, with displacements of 22,800 tons, twelve guns in 6 turrets, reciprocating engines generating a maximum speed of 21 knots, and a price tag of 46 million marks. Again, the turret configuration was dictated by the need to use the centre of the ship for machinery, despite the disadvantage of the turret layout. The ships were now equipped with torpedoes.
The s built between 1909 and 1913 introduced a change in design as turbine engines were finally approved. The ships had ten 30.5 cm guns, losing two of the centre side turrets but gaining an additional turret astern on the centre line. As with the &quot;Von der Tann&quot; design, which was drawn up at a similar time, all guns could be fired either side in broadsides, meaning more guns could come to bear than with the &quot;Helgoland&quot; design, despite having fewer in total. Five ships were constructed rather than the usual four, one to act as a fleet flagship. One ship, the , was equipped with only two turbines rather than three, with the intention of having an additional diesel engine for cruising, but the Howaldt engine could not be developed in time. &quot;Luitpold&quot; had a top speed of 20 knots as a result, compared to 22 knots for the other ships. The ships were larger than the preceding class at 24,700 tons, but cheaper at 45 million marks. They formed part of the third squadron of the High Seas Fleet as it was constituted for World War I.

Between 1908 and 1912 two s were constructed, adding an extra turret on the centre line astern, raised above the aft turret, but still using 28 cm guns. became part of the High Seas Fleet, but became part of the Mediterranean squadron and spent World War I as part of the Ottoman navy. The ships cost 42.6 and 41.6 million marks, with maximum speed of 28 knots. was constructed as a slightly enlarged version of the &quot;Moltke&quot; design, reaching a maximum speed of 29 knots. All cruisers were equipped with turbine engines from 1908 onwards. Between 1910 and 1912 four light cruisers were constructed of 4,600 tons, at around 7.4 million marks each. The ships were fitted with oil burners to improve the effectiveness of their main coal fueling. These were followed by the similar but slightly enlarged and marginally faster and light cruisers.

In 1907 a naval artillery school was established at Sonderburg (north of Kiel). This aimed to address the difficulties with the new generation of guns, which with potentially greater range required aiming devices capable of directing them at targets at those extreme ranges. By 1914, experiments were being conducted with guns in increasing sizes up to . Capital ships were fitted with spotting tops high up on masts with range finding equipment, while ship design was altered to place turrets on the centre line of the ship for improved accuracy.

The four s were commenced between October 1911 and May 1912 and entered service in 1914 at a cost of 45 million marks, forming the other part of the Third Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. They were 28,500 tons, with a maximum speed of 21 knots from three triple-stage Brown-Boverie-Parsons turbines. Main armament was five double turrets housing twin 30.5 cm guns, arranged with two turrets fore and aft and one in the centre of the ship. The second turret at either end was raised higher than the outer so that it could fire over the top (superfiring). As with &quot;Prinzregent Luitpold&quot;, the ships were originally intended to have one diesel engine for cruising, but these were never developed and turbines were fitted instead. The ships were equipped with torpedo nets, trailed along the hull intended to stop torpedoes, but these reduced maximum speed to an impractical 8 knots and were later removed.

Construction began in 1910 of the first submarine powered by twin diesel engines. &quot;U-19&quot; was twice the size of the first German submarine, had five times the range at cruising at 8 knots, or 15 knots maximum. There were now two bow and two stern torpedo tubes, with six torpedoes carried. The ships were designed to operate at a depth of , though could go to .

==1912 to 1914, Third &quot;Novelle&quot;==

Spending on the navy increased inexorably year by year. In 1909 Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow and Treasury Secretary Reinhold von Sydow attempted to pass a new budget boosting taxes in an attempt to reduce the deficit. The Social Democratic parties refused to accept the increased taxes on goods, while the conservatives opposed increases in inheritance taxes. Bülow and Sydow resigned in defeat and Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg became Chancellor. His attempted solution was to initiate negotiations with Britain for an agreed slow down in naval building. Negotiations came to nothing when in 1911 the Agadir Crisis brought France and Germany into conflict. Germany attempted to &#x27;persuade&#x27; France to cede territory in the Middle Congo in return for giving France a free hand in Morocco. The effect was to raise concerns in Britain over Germany&#x27;s expansionist aims, and encouraged Britain to form a closer relationship with France, including naval cooperation. Tirpitz saw this once again as an opportunity to press for naval expansion and the continuation of the four capital ships per year building rate into 1912. The January 1912 elections brought a Reichstag where the Social Democrats, opposed to military expansion, became the largest party.

The German army, mindful of the steadily increasing proportion of spending going to the navy, demanded an increase of 136,000 men to bring its size closer to that of France. In February 1912 the British war minister, Viscount Haldane, came to Berlin to discuss possible limits to naval expansion. Meanwhile, in Britain, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill made a speech describing the German navy as a &#x27;luxury&#x27;, which was considered an insult when reported in Germany. The talks came to nothing, ending in recriminations over who had offered what. Bethmann Hollweg argued for a guaranteed proportion of expenditure for the army, but failed when army officers refused to support him publicly. Tirpitz argued for six new capital ships, and got three, together with 15,000 additional sailors in a new combined military budget passed in April 1912. The new ships, together with the existing reserve flagship and four reserve battleships were to become one new squadron for the High Seas Fleet. In all the fleet would have five squadrons of eight battleships, twelve large cruisers and thirty small, plus additional cruisers for overseas duties. Tirpitz intended that with the rolling program of replacements, the existing coastal defence squadron of old ships would become a sixth fleet squadron, while the eight existing battle-cruisers would be joined by eight more as replacements for the large cruisers presently in the overseas squadrons. The plan envisaged a main fleet of 100,000 men, 49 battleships and 28 battlecruisers by 1920. The Kaiser commented of the British, &quot;... we have them up against the wall.&quot;

Although Tirpitz had succeeded in getting more ships, the proportion of military expenditure on the navy declined in 1912 and thereafter, from 35% in 1911 to 33% in 1912 and 25% in 1913. This reflected a change in attitude amongst military planners that a land war in Europe was increasingly likely, and a turning away from Tirpitz&#x27;s scheme for worldwide expansion using the navy. In 1912 General von Moltke commented, &quot;I consider war to be unavoidable, and the sooner the better.&quot; The Kaiser&#x27;s younger brother, Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia, considered that the cost of the navy was now too great. In Britain, Churchill announced an intention to build two capital ships for every one constructed by Germany, and reorganised the fleet to move battleships from the Mediterranean to Channel waters. A policy was introduced of promoting British naval officers by merit and ability rather than time served, which saw rapid promotions for Jellicoe and Beatty, both of whom had important roles in the forthcoming World War I. By 1913 the French and British had plans in place for joint naval action against Germany, and France moved its Atlantic fleet from Brest to Toulon, replacing British ships.

Britain also escalated the arms race by expanding the capabilities of its new battleships. The five 1912 of 32,000 tons would have guns and would be completely oil-fuelled, allowing a speed of 25 knots. For 1912–13 Germany concentrated on battlecruisers, with three ships of 27,000 tons and 26–27 knots maximum speed, costing 56–59 million marks each. These had four turrets mounting two 30.5 cm guns arranged in two turrets either end, with the inner turret superfiring over the outer. was the first German ship to have anti-aircraft guns fitted.

In 1913, Germany responded to the British challenge by laying down two battleships. These did not enter service until after the Battle of Jutland, so failed to take part in any major naval action of the war. They had displacement of 28,600 tons, a crew of 1,100 and a speed of 22 knots, costing 50 million marks. Guns were arranged in the same pattern as the preceding battle-cruisers, but were now increased to diameter. The ships had four 8.8 cm anti-aircraft and also sixteen 15 cm lighter guns, but were coal fuelled. It was considered that coal bunkers at the sides of the ship added to protection against penetrating shells, but Germany also did not have a reliable supply of fuel oil. Two more ships of the class were later laid down, but never completed.
Three light cruisers commenced construction in German yards in 1912–1913 ordered by the Russian Navy, costing around 9 million marks. The ships were seized at the outbreak of World War I becoming , and . Two larger cruisers, and were also commenced and entered service in 1915. More torpedo boats were constructed, with gradually increasing sizes having reached 800 tons for the V-25 to V-30 craft constructed by AG Vulcan in Kiel before 1914. In 1912 Germany created a Mediterranean squadron consisting of the battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; and light cruiser &quot;Breslau&quot;.

===Air power===
Naval trials of balloons began in 1891, but the results were unsatisfactory and none were purchased by the navy. In 1895 Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin attempted to interest both the army and navy in his new rigid airships, but without success. The Zeppelin rigids were considered too slow and there were concerns with their reliability operating over water. In 1909 the navy rejected proposals for aircraft to be launched from ships, and again in 1910 declined Zeppelin&#x27;s airships. Finally in 1911, trials with aircraft began and in 1912 Tirpitz agreed to purchase the first airship for naval reconnaissance at a cost of 850,000 marks.

The machine had insufficient range () to operate over Britain, but had machine guns for use against aircraft and experimental bombs. The following year ten more were ordered and a new naval air division was created at Johannisthal, near Berlin. However, in September 1913 L 1 was destroyed in a storm, while the following month L 2 was lost in a gas explosion. Orders for the undelivered machines were cancelled, leaving the navy with one machine, the L 3.

In 1910 Prince Heinrich had learned to fly and supported the cause of naval aviation. In 1911 experiments took place with Albatros seaplanes and in 1912 Tirpitz authorized 200,000 marks for seaplane trials. The Curtiss seaplane was adopted. By 1913 there were four aeroplanes, now including a British Sopwith, and long-term plans to create six naval air stations by 1918. By 1914, the &quot;Marine-Fliegerabteilung&quot;, the naval counterpart to the well-established &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; land-based aviation units of the Army, comprised twelve seaplanes and one landplane and disposed of a budget of 8.5 million marks. Trials in 1914 using seaplanes operating with the fleet were less than impressive; out of four taking part one crashed, one was unable to take off and only one succeeded in all tasks. The most successful aircraft had been the British design, and indeed experiments in Britain had been proceeding with the support of Winston Churchill, and included converting ferries and liners into seaplane carriers.

==World War I==

By the start of the First World War, the German Imperial Navy possessed 22 pre-Dreadnoughts, 14 dreadnought battleships and 4 battle-cruisers. A further three ships of the &quot;König&quot; class were completed between August and November 1914, and two &quot;Bayern&quot;-class battleships entered service in 1916. The battlecruisers &quot;Derfflinger&quot;, , and were completed in September 1914, March 1916, and May 1917, respectively. All but the latest pre-Dreadnoughts were soon decommissioned, so that their crews could be transferred to more useful vessels.

The main fighting forces of the navy were to become the High Seas Fleet and the U-boat fleet. Smaller fleets were deployed to the German overseas protectorates, the most prominent being assigned to the East Asia Squadron at Qingdao.

The German Navy&#x27;s U-boats were also instrumental in the sinking of the passenger liner and auxiliary cruiser, the on 7 May 1915, which was one of the main events that led to the USA joining the war two years later in 1917.

===Engagements===

Notable battles fought by the Navy were:
* Battle of Heligoland Bight (Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass) – 1914
* Battle of Coronel (Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee) – 1914. The East Asia Squadron defeated the British West Indies Squadron
* Battle of the Falkland Islands (Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee) – 1914. The East Asia Squadron was defeated by British battlecruisers
* Battle of Dogger Bank (Vice Admiral Franz Hipper) – 1915. Armoured cruiser &quot;Blücher&quot; sank and British battlecruiser &quot;Lion&quot; put out of action.
* Battle of the Gulf of Riga (Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt)
* Battle of Jutland (Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer; Vice Admiral Franz Hipper) -1916. In the largest naval battle of the war several British ships were sunk or damaged but the High Seas Fleet was unable to damage the British Grand Fleet sufficiently to threaten the blockade of Germany.
* Operation Albion, including Battle of Moon Sound (Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt) – 1917. In the Baltic against Russian forces.
* First Battle of the Atlantic – U-boat warfare

Notable minor battles:
* Battle of Gotland
* First Battle of Dover Strait – 1916. Torpedo boat attack on Dover Barrage
* Second Battle of Dover Strait – 1917. Attack on Dover Barrage
* Battle of Cocos
* Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby – 1914. Bombardment of British east coast ports.
* Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau
* Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft – 1916. Bombardment of British east coast ports.
* Battle of Trindade
Minor engagements included the commerce raiding carried out by the &quot;Emden&quot;, , and the sailing ship and commerce raider .

The Imperial Navy carried out land operations, e.g. operating the long-range Paris Gun which was based on a naval gun. The Siege of Tsingtao (Qingdao) used naval troops as Qingdao was a naval base, and also as the Imperial Navy was directly under the Imperial Government (the German Army was made up of regiments from the various states).

Following the Battle of Jutland, the capital ships of the Imperial Navy had been confined to inactive service in harbor. In October 1918, the Imperial Naval Command in Kiel under Admiral Franz von Hipper, without authorization, planned to dispatch the fleet for a last battle against the Royal Navy in the English Channel. The naval order of 24 October 1918 and the preparations to sail first triggered the Kiel Mutiny among the affected sailors and then a general revolution which was to sweep aside the monarchy within a few days.

==Marines==
The Marines were referred to as &quot;Seebataillone&quot; (sea battalions). They served in the Prussian Navy, the North German Federal Navy, the Imperial German Navy and in the modern German Navy.

==Naval aviation==

The &quot;Marine-Fliegerabteilung&quot; consisted of Zeppelins (airships), observation balloons and fixed-wing aircraft.

The main use of the Zeppelins was in reconnaissance over the North Sea and the Baltic, where the endurance of the craft led German warships to a number of Allied vessels. Zeppelin patrolling had priority over any other airship activity. During the entire war around 1,200 scouting flights were made. During 1915 the German Navy had some 15 Zeppelins in commission and was able to have two or more patrolling continuously at any one time. They kept the British ships from approaching Germany, spotted when and where the British were laying sea-mines, and later aided in the destruction of those mines. Zeppelins would sometimes land on the sea surface next to a minesweeper, bring aboard an officer and show him the lay of the mines. The Naval and Army Air Services also directed a number of strategic raids against Britain, leading the way in bombing techniques and also forcing the British to bolster their anti-aircraft defences. The possibility of airship raids were approved by the Kaiser on 9 January 1915, although he excluded London as a target and further demanded that no attacks be made on historic or government buildings or museums. The night-time raids were intended to target only military sites on the east coast and around the Thames estuary, but difficulties in navigation and the height from which the bombs were dropped made accurate bombing impossible, and most bombs fell on civilian targets or open countryside.

Stationed in North Sea coastal airfields, German naval aircraft often fought against their British counterparts of the Royal Naval Air Service. Naval pilots flew aircraft that were also used by the German Army&#x27;s &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; in addition to seaplanes. Theo Osterkamp was one of the original naval pilots, the first German pilot to fly a land-based aircraft to England on a reconnaissance mission, and its leading ace with 32 victories. By war&#x27;s end, the roster of German naval flying aces also included Gotthard Sachsenberg (31 victories), Alexander Zenzes (18 victories), Friedrich Christiansen (13 victories), Karl Meyer (8 victories), Karl Scharon (8 victories), and Hans Goerth (7 victories). Another decorated aviator was Gunther Plüschow who shot down a Japanese plane during the Siege of Tsingtao and was the only German combatant to escape from a prison camp in Britain.

List of aircraft that were assigned to naval air service:
* &quot;Kaiserliche Werft Danzig&quot; 1105 – trainer
* &quot;Hansa-Brandenburg&quot; W.12 – fighter floatplane
* &quot;Hansa-Brandenburg&quot; W.29 – fighter floatplane

Naval Air Service Units included &quot;Marine Jagdgruppe Flandern&quot; composed of:
* &quot;Marine Feld Jasta&quot; I
* &quot;Marine Feldflieger Abteilung&quot; II

==Post-war==
After the end of World War I, the bulk of the navy&#x27;s modern ships (74 in all) were interned at Scapa Flow (November 1918), where the entire fleet (with a few exceptions) was scuttled by its crews on 21 June 1919 on orders from its commander, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.

Ernest Cox subsequently salvaged many of the Scapa Flow ships.

The surviving ships of the Imperial Navy became the basis for the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; of the Weimar Republic.

==Ranks and ratings==

The Imperial German Navy&#x27;s rank and rating system combined that of Prussia&#x27;s with the navies of other northern states.

==War crimes==

The Imperial German Navy was implicated in several war crimes committed during the First World War, most notably:
* Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in 1914, in which several British ports were bombarded causing 112 civilian deaths.
* The U-boat campaign. Prize rules, which required commerce raiders to warn their targets and allow time for the crew to board lifeboats were disregarded and commercial vessels were sunk regardless of nationality, cargo, or destination. Following the 1915 sinking of the the practice was withdrawn, but was then resumed in February 1917. This outraged the U.S. public, prompting the U.S. to enter the war on Allied side.
* The execution of the civilian captain Charles Fryatt, who, while in command of the passenger ship , attempted to ram the submarine .
* The sinking of the hospital ships HMHS &quot;Llandovery Castle&quot;, HS &quot;Koningin Regentes&quot; and HMHS &quot;Dover Castle&quot;.

<text>The  (, ) was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire (1871–1918) and the inter-war (1919–1935) of the Weimar Republic. The was one of three official branches, along with the and the , of the , the German armed forces from 1935 to 1945.

In violation of the Treaty of Versailles, the grew rapidly during German naval rearmament in the 1930s. The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of submarines.

 ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention, but in reality supporting the Nationalists against the Spanish Republicans.

In January 1939, Plan Z, a massive shipbuilding programme, was ordered, calling for surface naval parity with the British Royal Navy by 1944. When World War II broke out in September 1939, Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building programme for submarines (U-boats) instead of capital surface warships, and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources.

The Commander-in-Chief of the (as for all branches of the armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power) was Adolf Hitler, who exercised his authority through the (&#x27;High Command of the Navy&#x27;).

Among the &#x27;s most significant ships were its U-boats, most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II. Wolfpacks were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic, but this tactic was largely abandoned by May 1943, when U-boat losses mounted. Along with the U-boats, surface commerce raiders (including auxiliary cruisers) were used to disrupt Allied shipping in the early years of the war, the most famous of these being the heavy cruisers &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; and &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;. However, the adoption of convoy escorts, especially in the Atlantic, greatly reduced the effectiveness of surface commerce raiders against convoys.

Following the end of World War II in 1945, the &#x27;s remaining ships were divided up among the Allied powers and were used for various purposes including minesweeping. Some were loaded with superfluous chemical weapons and scuttled.
==History==
===Post–World War I origins===
Under the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, Germany was only allowed a minimal navy of 15,000 personnel, six capital ships of no more than 10,000 tons, six cruisers, twelve destroyers, twelve torpedo boats, and no submarines or aircraft carriers. Military aircraft were also banned, so Germany could have no naval aviation. Under the treaty Germany could only build new ships to replace old ones. All the ships allowed and personnel were taken over from the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;, which was renamed the .

From the outset, Germany worked to circumvent the military restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. The Germans continued to develop U-boats through a submarine design office in the Netherlands (&quot;NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw&quot;) and a torpedo research program in Sweden where the G7e torpedo was developed.

Even before the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933 the German government decided on 15 November 1932 to launch a prohibited naval re-armament program that included U-boats, airplanes, and an aircraft carrier.

The launching of the first pocket battleship, in 1931 (as a replacement for the old pre-dreadnought battleship ) was a step in the formation of a modern German fleet. The building of the &quot;Deutschland&quot; caused consternation among the French and the British as they had expected that the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles would limit the replacement of the pre-dreadnought battleships to coastal defence ships, suitable only for defensive warfare. By using innovative construction techniques, the Germans had built a heavy ship suitable for offensive warfare on the high seas while still abiding by the letter of the treaty.

===Nazi control===

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Hitler soon began to more brazenly ignore many of the Treaty restrictions and accelerated German naval rearmament. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 18 June 1935 allowed Germany to build a navy equivalent to 35% of the British surface ship tonnage and 45% of British submarine tonnage; battleships were to be limited to 35,000 tons. That same year the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; was renamed as the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. In April 1939, as tensions escalated between the United Kingdom and Germany over Poland, Hitler unilaterally rescinded the restrictions of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.

The building-up of the German fleet in the time period of 1935–1939 was slowed by problems with marshaling enough manpower and material for ship building. This was because of the simultaneous and rapid build-up of the German Army and Air Force which demanded substantial effort and resources. Some projects, like the D-class cruisers and the P-class cruisers, had to be cancelled.

===Spanish Civil War===

The first military action of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; came during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). Following the outbreak of hostilities in July 1936 several large warships of the German fleet were sent to the region. The heavy cruisers &quot;Deutschland&quot; and , and the light cruiser were the first to be sent in July 1936. These large ships were accompanied by the 2nd Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The German presence was used to covertly support Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists although the immediate involvement of the &quot;Deutschland&quot; was humanitarian relief operations and evacuating 9,300 refugees, including 4,550 German citizens. Following the brokering of the International Non-Intervention Patrol to enforce an international arms embargo, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was allotted the patrol area between Cabo de Gata (Almeria) and Cabo de Oropesa. Numerous vessels served as part of these duties including . On 29 May 1937 the &quot;Deutschland&quot; was attacked off Ibiza by two bombers from the Republican Air Force. Total casualties from the Republican attack were 31 dead and 110 wounded, 71 seriously, mostly burn victims. In retaliation the &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; shelled Almeria on 31 May killing 19–20 civilians, wounding 50 and destroying 35 buildings. Following further attacks by Republican submarines against the off the port of Oran between 15 and 18 June 1937 Germany withdrew from the Non-Intervention Patrol.

U-boats also participated in covert action against Republican shipping as part of Operation Ursula. At least eight U-boats engaged a small number of targets in the area throughout the conflict. (By comparison the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; operated 58 submarines in the area as part of the &quot;Sottomarini Legionari&quot;.)

===Plan Z===

The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; saw as her main tasks the controlling of the Baltic Sea and winning a war against France in connection with the German army, because France was seen as the most likely enemy in the event of war. But in 1938 Hitler wanted to have the possibility of winning a war against Great Britain at sea in the coming years. Therefore, he ordered plans for such a fleet from the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. From the three proposed plans (X, Y and Z) he approved Plan Z in January 1939. This blueprint for the new German naval construction program envisaged building a navy of approximately 800 ships during the period 1939–1947. Hitler demanded that the program be completed by 1945. The main force of Plan Z were six H-class battleships. In the version of Plan Z drawn up in August 1939, the German fleet was planned to consist of the following ships by 1945:
* 4 aircraft carriers
* 10 battleships
* 15 armored ships (&quot;Panzerschiffe&quot;)
* 3 battlecruisers
* 5 heavy cruisers
* 44 light cruisers
* 158 destroyers and torpedo boats
* 249 submarines
* Numerous smaller craft
Personnel strength was planned to rise to over 200,000.

The planned naval program was not very far advanced by the time World War II began. In 1939 two s and two H-class battleships were laid down and parts for two further H-class battleships and three s were in production. The strength of the German fleet at the beginning of the war was not even 20% of Plan Z. On 1 September 1939, the navy still had a total personnel strength of only 78,000, and it was not at all ready for a major role in the war. Because of the long time it would take to get the Plan Z fleet ready for action and shortage in workers and material in wartime, Plan Z was essentially shelved in September 1939 and the resources allocated for its realisation were largely redirected to the construction of U-boats, which would be ready for war against the United Kingdom more quickly.

===World War II===
The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; took part in the Battle of Westerplatte and the Battle of the Danzig Bay during the invasion of Poland. In 1939, major events for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; were the sinking of the British aircraft carrier and the British battleship and the loss of at the Battle of the River Plate. Submarine attacks on Britain&#x27;s vital maritime supply routes (Battle of the Atlantic) started immediately at the outbreak of war, although they were hampered by the lack of well placed ports from which to operate. Throughout the war the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was responsible for coastal artillery protecting major ports and important coastal areas. It also operated anti-aircraft batteries protecting major ports.

In April 1940, the German Navy was heavily involved in the invasion of Norway, where it suffered significant losses, which included the heavy cruiser sunk by artillery and torpedoes from Norwegian shore batteries at the Oscarsborg Fortress in the Oslofjord. Ten destroyers were lost in the Battles of Narvik (half of German destroyer strength at the time), and two light cruisers, the &quot;Königsberg&quot; which was bombed and sunk by Royal Navy aircraft in Bergen, and the &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; which was sunk off the coast of Kristiansand by a British submarine. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; did in return sink some British warships during this campaign, including the aircraft carrier .

The losses in the Norwegian Campaign left only a handful of undamaged heavy ships available for the planned, but never executed, invasion of the United Kingdom (Operation Sea Lion) in the summer of 1940. There were serious doubts that the invasion sea routes could have been protected against British naval interference. The Fall of France and the conquest of Norway gave German submarines greatly improved access to British shipping routes in the Atlantic. At first, British convoys lacked escorts that were adequate either in numbers or equipment and, as a result, the submarines had much success for few losses (this period was dubbed the First Happy Time by the Germans).

Italy entered the war in June 1940, and the Battle of the Mediterranean began: from September 1941 to May 1944 some 62 German submarines were transferred there, sneaking past the British naval base at Gibraltar. The Mediterranean submarines sank 24 major Allied warships (including 12 destroyers, 4 cruisers, 2 aircraft carriers, and 1 battleship) and 94 merchant ships (449,206 tons of shipping). None of the Mediterranean submarines made it back to their home bases, as they were all either sunk in battle or scuttled by their crews at the end of the war.

In 1941, one of the four modern German battleships, sank while breaking out into the Atlantic for commerce raiding. The &quot;Bismarck&quot; was in turn hunted down by much superior British forces after being crippled by an air-launched torpedo. She was subsequently scuttled after being rendered a burning wreck by two British battleships.

In November 1941 during the Battle of the Mediterranean, German submarine &quot;U-331&quot; sank the British battleship &quot;Barham&quot;, which had a magazine explosion and sank in minutes, with the loss of 862, or 2/3 of her crew.

During 1941, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and the United States Navy became &quot;de facto&quot; belligerents, although war was not formally declared, leading to the sinking of the . This course of events were the result of the American decision to support Britain with its Lend-Lease program and the subsequent decision to escort Lend-Lease convoys with US war ships through the western part of the Atlantic.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent German declaration of war against the United States in December 1941 led to another phase of the Battle of the Atlantic. In Operation Drumbeat and subsequent operations until August 1942, a large number of Allied merchant ships were sunk by submarines off the US coast as the Americans had not prepared for submarine warfare, despite clear warnings (this was the so-called Second Happy Time for the German Navy). The situation became so serious that military leaders feared for the whole Allied strategy. The vast American ship building capabilities and naval forces were however now brought into the war and soon more than offset any losses inflicted by the German submariners. In 1942, the submarine warfare continued on all fronts, and when German forces in the Soviet Union reached the Black Sea, a few submarines were eventually transferred there.

In February 1942, the three large warships stationed on the Atlantic coast at Brest were evacuated back to German ports for deployment to Norway. The ships had been repeatedly damaged by air attacks by the RAF, the supply ships to support Atlantic sorties had been destroyed by the Royal Navy, and Hitler now felt that Norway was the &quot;zone of destiny&quot; for these ships. The two battleships and and the heavy cruiser passed through the English Channel (Channel Dash) on their way to Norway despite British efforts to stop them. Not since the Spanish Armada in 1588 had any warships in wartime done this. It was a tactical victory for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and a blow to British morale, but the withdrawal removed the possibility of attacking allied convoys in the Atlantic with heavy surface ships.

With the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 Britain started to send Arctic convoys with military goods around Norway to support their new ally. In 1942 German forces began heavily attacking these convoys, mostly with bombers and U-boats. The big ships of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in Norway were seldom involved in these attacks, because of the inferiority of German radar technology, and because Hitler and the leadership of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; feared losses of these precious ships. The most effective of these attacks was the near destruction of Convoy PQ 17 in July 1942. Later in the war German attacks on these convoys were mostly reduced to U-boat activities and the mass of the allied freighters reached their destination in Soviet ports.

The Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 was an attempt by a German naval surface force to attack an Allied Arctic convoy. However, the advantage was not pressed home and they returned to base. There were serious implications: this failure infuriated Hitler, who nearly enforced a decision to scrap the surface fleet. Instead, resources were diverted to new U-boats, and the surface fleet became a lesser threat to the Allies.

After December 1943 when had been sunk in an attack on an Arctic convoy in the Battle of North Cape by , most German surface ships in bases at the Atlantic were blockaded in, or close to, their ports as a &quot;fleet in being&quot;, for fear of losing them in action and to tie up British naval forces. The largest of these ships, the battleship , was stationed in Norway as a threat to Allied shipping and also as a defence against a potential Allied invasion. When she was sunk, after several attempts, by British bombers in November 1944 (Operation Catechism), several British capital ships could be moved to the Far East.

From late 1944 until the end of the war, the surviving surface fleet of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (heavy cruisers: , , , , light cruisers: , , ) was heavily engaged in providing artillery support to the retreating German land forces along the Baltic coast and in ferrying civilian refugees to the western Baltic Sea parts of Germany (Mecklenburg, Schleswig-Holstein) in large rescue operations. Large parts of the population of eastern Germany fled the approaching Red Army out of fear for Soviet retaliation (mass rapes, killings, and looting by Soviet troops did occur). The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; evacuated two million civilians and troops in the evacuation of East Prussia and Danzig from January to May 1945. It was during this activity that the catastrophic sinking of several large passenger ships occurred: and were sunk by Soviet submarines, while was sunk by British bombers, each sinking claiming thousands of civilian lives. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; also provided important assistance in the evacuation of the fleeing German civilians of Pomerania and Stettin in March and April 1945.

A desperate measure of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to fight the superior strength of the Western Allies from 1944 was the formation of the &quot;Kleinkampfverbände&quot; (Small Battle Units). These were special naval units with frogmen, manned torpedoes, motorboats laden with explosives and so on. The more effective of these weapons and units were the development and deployment of midget submarines like the &quot;Molch&quot; and &quot;Seehund&quot;. In the last stage of the war, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; also organised a number of divisions of infantry from its personnel.

Between 1943 and 1945, a group of U-boats known as the &quot;Monsun&quot; Boats (&quot;Monsun Gruppe&quot;) operated in the Indian Ocean from Japanese bases in the occupied Dutch East Indies and Malaya. Allied convoys had not yet been organised in those waters, so initially many ships were sunk. However, this situation was soon remedied. During the later war years, the &quot;Monsun&quot; Boats were also used as a means of exchanging vital war supplies with Japan.

During 1943 and 1944, due to Allied anti-submarine tactics and better equipment, the U-boat fleet started to suffer heavy losses. The turning point of the Battle of the Atlantic was during Black May in 1943, when the U-boat fleet started suffering heavy losses and the number of Allied ships sunk started to decrease. Radar, longer range air cover, sonar, improved tactics, and new weapons all contributed. German technical developments, such as the &quot;Schnorchel&quot;, attempted to counter these. Near the end of the war a small number of the new &quot;Elektroboot&quot; U-boats (types XXI and XXIII) became operational, the first submarines designed to operate submerged at all times. The &quot;Elektroboote&quot; had the potential to negate the Allied technological and tactical advantage, although they were deployed too late to see combat in the war.

===War crimes===
Following the capture of Liepāja in Latvia by the Germans on 29 June 1941, the town came under the command of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. On 1 July 1941, the town commandant &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Stein ordered that ten hostages be shot for every act of sabotage, and further put civilians in the zone of targeting by declaring that Red Army soldiers were hiding among them in civilian attire.

On 5 July 1941 &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Brückner, who had taken over from Stein, issued a set of anti-Jewish regulations in the local newspaper, &quot;Kurzemes Vārds&quot;. Summarized, the regulations were as follows:
* All Jews were to wear the yellow star on the front and back of their clothing;
* Shopping hours for Jews were restricted to 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon. Jews were only allowed out of their residences for these hours and from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.;
* Jews were barred from public events and transportation and were not to walk on the beach;
* Jews were required to leave the pavement if they encountered a German in uniform;
* Jewish shops were required to display the sign &quot;A Jewish-owned business&quot; in the window;
* Jews were to surrender all radios, typewriters, uniforms, arms, and means of transportation

On 16 July 1941, &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; Dr. Hans Kawelmacher was appointed the German naval commandant in Liepāja. On 22 July, Kawelmacher sent a telegram to the German Navy&#x27;s Baltic Command in Kiel, which stated that he wanted 100 SS and fifty &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; (protective police) men sent to Liepāja for &quot;quick implementation Jewish problem&quot;. Kawelmacher hoped to accelerate the killings, complaining: &quot;Here about 8,000 Jews... with present SS-personnel, this would take one year, which is untenable for [the] pacification of Liepāja.&quot; Kawelmacher telegram on 27 July 1941 read: &quot;Jewish problem Libau largely solved by execution of about 1,100 male Jews by Riga SS commando on 24 and 25.7.&quot;

In September 1939, U-boat commander Fritz-Julius Lemp of &quot;U-30&quot; sank SS Athenia (1922) after mistaking it for a legitimate military target, resulting in the deaths of 117 civilians. Germany did not admit responsibility for the incident until after the war. Lemp was killed in action in 1941. U-247 was alleged to have shot at sunken ship survivors, but as the vessel was lost at sea with its crew, there was no investigation.

In 1945, U-boat Commander Heinz-Wilhelm Eck of was tried along with four of his crewmen for shooting at survivors. All were found guilty, with three of them, including Eck, being executed. In 1946, Hellmuth von Ruckteschell was sentenced to 10 years in prison, reduced to 7 years on appeal, for the illegal sinking of ships and criminal negligence for failing to protect the downed crew of the SS Anglo Saxon. Ruckteschell died in prison in 1948.

===Post-war division===
After the war, the German surface ships that remained afloat (only the cruisers and , and a dozen destroyers were operational) were divided among the victors by the Tripartite Naval Commission. The US used the heavy cruiser in nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll in 1946 as a target ship for the Operation Crossroads. Some (like the unfinished aircraft carrier ) were used for target practice with conventional weapons, while others (mostly destroyers and torpedo boats) were put into the service of Allied navies that lacked surface ships after the war. The training barque SSS &quot;Horst Wessel&quot; was recommissioned USCGC &quot;Eagle&quot; and remains in active service, assigned to the United States Coast Guard Academy. The British, French, and Soviet navies received the destroyers, and some torpedo boats went to the Danish and Norwegian navies. For the purpose of mine clearing, the Royal Navy employed German crews and minesweepers from June 1945 to January 1948, organised in the German Mine Sweeping Administration (GMSA), which consisted of 27,000 members of the former &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and 300 vessels.

The destroyers and the Soviet share light cruiser were all retired by the end of the 1950s, but five escort destroyers were returned from the French to the new West German Navy in the 1950s and three 1945 scuttled type XXI and XXIII U-boats were raised by West Germany and integrated into their new navy. In 1956, with West Germany&#x27;s accession to NATO, a new navy was established and was referred to as the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (Federal Navy). Some &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; commanders like Erich Topp and Otto Kretschmer went on to serve in the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot;. In East Germany the &quot;Volksmarine&quot; (People&#x27;s Navy) was established in 1956. With the reunification of Germany in 1990, it was decided to use the name &quot;Deutsche Marine&quot; (German Navy).

==Ships==
By the start of World War II, much of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; were modern ships: fast, well-armed, and well-armoured. This had been achieved by concealment but also by deliberately flouting World War I peace terms and those of various naval treaties. However, the war started with the German Navy still at a distinct disadvantage in terms of sheer size with what were expected to be its primary adversaries – the navies of France and Great Britain. Although a major re-armament of the navy (Plan Z) was planned, and initially begun, the start of the war in 1939 meant that the vast amounts of material required for the project were diverted to other areas. The sheer disparity in size when compared to the other European powers navies prompted Raeder to write of his own navy once the war began &quot;The surface forces can do no more than show that they know how to die gallantly.&quot; A number of captured ships from occupied countries were added to the German fleet as the war progressed. Though six major units of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; were sunk during the war (both &quot;Bismarck&quot;-class battleships and both &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;-class battleships, as well as two heavy cruisers), there were still many ships afloat (including four heavy cruisers and four light cruisers) as late as March 1945.

Some ship types do not fit clearly into the commonly used ship classifications. Where there is argument, this has been noted.

Construction of Graf Zeppelin was started in 1936 and construction of an unnamed sister ship was started two years later in 1938, but neither ship was completed. In 1942 conversion of three German passenger ships (&quot;Europa&quot;, &quot;Potsdam&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot;) and two unfinished cruisers, the captured French light cruiser and the German heavy cruiser , to auxiliary carriers was begun. In November 1942 the conversion of the passenger ships was stopped because these ships were now seen as too slow for operations with the fleet. But conversion of one of these ships, the &quot;Potsdam&quot;, to a training carrier was begun instead. In February 1943 all the work on carriers was halted because of the German failure during the Battle of the Barents Sea, which convinced Hitler that large warships were useless.

All engineering of the aircraft carriers like catapults, arresting gears and so on were tested and developed at the &quot;Erprobungsstelle See Travemünde&quot; (Experimental Agency Sea in Travemünde) including the airplanes for the aircraft carriers, the Fieseler Fi 167 ship-borne biplane torpedo and reconnaissance bomber and the naval versions of two key early war &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft: the Messerschmitt Bf 109T fighter and the Junkers Ju 87C Stuka dive bomber.

====Battleships====

The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; completed four battleships during its existence. The first pair were the 11-inch gun , consisting of the and , which participated in the invasion of Norway in 1940, and then in commerce raiding until the &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was heavily damaged by a British air raid in 1942 and the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was sunk in the Battle of the North Cape in late 1943. The second pair were the 15-inch gun , consisting of the and . The &quot;Bismarck&quot; was sunk on her first sortie into the Atlantic in 1941 (Operation Rheinübung) although she did sink the battlecruiser &quot;Hood&quot; and severely damaged the battleship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, while the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was based in Norwegian ports during most of the war as a fleet in being, tying up Allied naval forces, and subject to a number of attacks by British aircraft and submarines. More battleships were planned (the H-class), but construction was abandoned in September 1939.

====Pre-dreadnought battleships====

The World War I-era pre-dreadnought battleships and were used mainly as training ships, although they also participated in several military operations, with the latter bearing the distinction of firing the opening shots of World War II. and were converted into radio-guided target ships in 1928 and 1930 respectively. was decommissioned in 1931 and struck from the naval register in 1936. Plans to convert her into a radio-controlled target ship for aircraft was cancelled because of the outbreak of war in 1939.

====Battlecruisers====
Three O-class battlecruisers were ordered in 1939, but with the start of the war the same year there were not enough resources to build the ships.

====&quot;Panzerschiffe&quot; and Heavy cruisers====
The Deutschland-class cruisers were the (renamed &quot;Lützow&quot;), , and . Modern commentators favour classifying these as &quot;heavy cruisers&quot; and the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; itself reclassified these ships as such (&quot;Schwere Kreuzer&quot;) in 1940. In German language usage these three ships were designed and built as &quot;armoured ships&quot; (&quot;Panzerschiffe&quot;) – &quot;pocket battleship&quot; is an English label.

The &quot;Graf Spee&quot; was scuttled by her own crew in the Battle of the River Plate, in the Rio de la Plata estuary in December 1939. &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; was bombed on 9 April 1945 in port at Kiel and badly damaged, essentially beyond repair, and rolled over at her moorings. After the war that part of the harbor was filled in with rubble and the hulk buried. &quot;Lützow&quot; (ex-&quot;Deutschland&quot;) was bombed 16 April 1945 in the Baltic off Swinemünde just west of Stettin, and settled on the shallow bottom. With the Red Army advancing across the Oder, the ship was destroyed in place to prevent the Soviets capturing anything useful. The wreck was dismantled and scrapped in 1948–1949.

The Admiral Hipper-class cruisers in active service were , , and . Cruisers , and were never completed.

====Light cruisers====

The term &quot;light cruiser&quot; is a shortening of the phrase &quot;light armoured cruiser&quot;. Light cruisers were defined under the Washington Naval Treaty by gun calibre. Light cruiser describes a small ship that was armoured in the same way as an armoured cruiser. In other words, like standard cruisers, light cruisers possessed a protective belt and a protective deck. Prior to this, smaller cruisers tended to be of the protected cruiser model and possessed only an armoured deck. The Kriegsmarine light cruisers were as follows:
* 
* 
* 

Never completed: three M-class cruisers

Never completed: KH-1 and KH-2 (&quot;Kreuzer&quot; (cruiser) Holland 1 and 2). Captured in the Netherlands 1940. Both being on the stocks and building continued for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;.

In addition, the former &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; light cruiser was captured by the Germans on 11 September 1943 after the capitulation of Italy. She was pressed into &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; service for a brief time before being destroyed by British MTBs.

====Auxiliary cruisers====

During the war, some merchant ships were converted into &quot;auxiliary cruisers&quot; and nine were used as commerce raiders sailing under false flags to avoid detection, and operated in all oceans with considerable effect. The German designation for the ships was &quot;&#x27;Handelstörkreuzer&quot;&#x27; thus the HSK serial assigned. Each had as well an administrative label more commonly used, e.g. Schiff 16 = Atlantis, Schiff 41 = Kormoran, etc. The auxiliary cruisers were:
* (HSK-1, Schiff 36)
* (HSK-2, Schiff 16)
* (HSK-3, Schiff 21)
* (HSK-4, Schiff 10)
* (HSK-5, Schiff 33)
* (HSK-6, Schiff 23)
* (HSK-7, Schiff 45)
* (HSK-8, Schiff 41)
* (HSK-9, Schiff 28)
* (HSK number not assigned, Schiff 14, never active in raider operations.)
* (HSK not assigned, Schiff 5, never active in raider operations, used as a training ship)

====Destroyers====
Although the German World War II destroyer (&quot;Zerstörer&quot;) fleet was modern and the ships were larger than conventional destroyers of other navies, they had problems. Early classes were unstable, wet in heavy weather, suffered from engine problems, and had short range. Some problems were solved with the evolution of later designs, but further developments were curtailed by the war and, ultimately, by Germany&#x27;s defeat. In the first year of World War II, they were used mainly to sow offensive minefields in shipping lanes close to the British coast.

====Torpedo boats====
These vessels evolved through the 1930s from small vessels, relying almost entirely on torpedoes, to what were effectively small destroyers with mines, torpedoes, and guns. Two classes of fleet torpedo boats were planned, but not built, in the 1940s.

====E-boats (&quot;Schnellboote&quot;)====

The E-boats were fast attack craft with torpedo tubes. Over 200 boats of this type were built for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;.

====Troop ships====
, &quot;Goya&quot;, , , &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;.

====Miscellaneous====
Thousands of smaller warships and auxiliaries served in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, including minelayers, minesweepers, mine transports, netlayers, floating AA and torpedo batteries, command ships, decoy ships (small merchantmen with hidden weaponry), gunboats, monitors, escorts, patrol boats, sub-chasers, landing craft, landing support ships, training ships, test ships, torpedo recovery boats, dispatch boats, aviso, fishery protection ships, survey ships, harbor defense boats, target ships and their radio control vessels, motor explosive boats, weather ships, tankers, colliers, tenders, supply ships, tugs, barges, icebreakers, hospital and accommodation ships, floating cranes and docks, and many others. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; employed hundreds of auxiliary &quot;Vorpostenboote&quot; during the war, mostly civilian ships that were drafted and fitted with military equipment, for use in coastal operations.

===Submarines===
The Submarine Arm of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was titled the &quot;U-bootwaffe&quot; (&quot;submarine force&quot;). At the outbreak of war, it had a fleet of 57 submarines. This was increased steadily until mid-1943, when losses from Allied counter-measures matched the new vessels launched.

The principal types were the Type IX, a long range type used in the western and southern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans; the Type VII, the most numerous type, used principally in the north Atlantic; and the small Type II, for coastal waters. Type X was a small class of minelayers and Type XIV was a specialised type used to support distant U-boat operations – the &quot;&quot;Milchkuh&quot; (Milkcow).

Types XXI and XXIII, the &quot;Elektroboot&quot;&quot;, could have negated much of the Allied anti-submarine tactics and technology, but only a few of this new type of U-boat became ready for combat at the end of the war. Post-war, they became the prototype for modern conventional submarines, such as the Soviet .

During World War II, about 60% of all U-boats commissioned were lost in action; 28,000 of the 40,000 U-boat crewmen were killed during the war and 8,000 were captured. The remaining U-boats were either surrendered to the Allies or scuttled by their own crews at the end of the war.

==Captured ships==
The military campaigns in Europe yielded a large number of captured vessels, many of which were under construction. Nations represented included Austria (riverine craft), Czechoslovakia (riverine craft), Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States (several landing craft), and Italy (after the armistice). Few of the incomplete ships of destroyer size or above were completed, but many smaller warships and auxiliaries were completed and commissioned into &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during the war. Additionally many captured or confiscated foreign civilian ships (merchantmen, fishing boats, tugboats etc.) were converted into auxiliary warships or support ships.

==Major enemy warships sunk or destroyed==
The first warship sunk in World War II was the destroyer , of the Polish Navy, by Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers from the carrier air group of aircraft carrier on 3 September 1939. This carrier air group (Trägergeschwader 186) was part of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, but at that time under command of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;.

==Organisation==

===Command structure===
Adolf Hitler was the Supreme Commander of all German forces, including the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. His authority was exercised through the &quot;Oberkommando der Marine&quot; (OKM) with a Commander-in-Chief (&quot;Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine&quot;), a Chief of Naval General Staff (&quot;Chef des Stabes der Seekriegsleitung&quot;), and a Chief of Naval Operations (&quot;Chef der Operationsabteilung&quot;). The first Commander-in-Chief of the OKM was Erich Raeder who was the Commander-in-Chief of the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; when it was renamed and reorganised in 1935. Raeder held the post until falling out with Hitler after the German failure in the Battle of the Barents Sea. He was replaced by Karl Dönitz on 30 January 1943 who held the command until he was appointed President of Germany upon Hitler&#x27;s suicide in April 1945. Hans-Georg von Friedeburg was then Commander-in-Chief of the OKM for the short period of time until Germany surrendered in May 1945.

Subordinate to these were regional, squadron, and temporary flotilla commands. Regional commands covered significant naval regions and were themselves sub-divided, as necessary. They were commanded by a &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; or an Admiral. There was a &quot;Marineoberkommando&quot; for the Baltic Fleet, &quot;Nord&quot;, &quot;Nordsee&quot;, &quot;Norwegen&quot;, &quot;Ost/Ostsee&quot; (formerly Baltic), &quot;Süd&quot;, and &quot;West&quot;. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; used a form of encoding called &quot;Gradnetzmeldeverfahren&quot; to denote regions on a map.

Each squadron (organised by type of ship) also had a command structure with its own Flag Officer. The commands were Battleships, Cruisers, Destroyers, Submarines (&quot;Führer der Unterseeboote&quot;), Torpedo Boats, Minesweepers, Reconnaissance Forces, Naval Security Forces, Big Guns and Hand Guns, and Midget Weapons.

Major naval operations were commanded by a &quot;Flottenchef&quot;. The &quot;Flottenchef&quot; controlled a flotilla and organized its actions during the operation. The commands were, by their nature, temporary.

The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; ship design bureau, known as the &quot;Marineamt&quot;, was administered by officers with experience in sea duty but not in ship design, while the naval architects who did the actual design work had only a theoretical understanding of design requirements. As a result, the German surface fleet was plagued by design flaws throughout the war.

Communication was undertaken using an eight-rotor system of Enigma encoding.

===Air units===
The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had a near-complete monopoly on all German military aviation, including naval aviation, a source of great interservice rivalry with the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Catapult-launched spotter planes like Arado Ar 196 twin-float seaplanes were manned by the so-called &quot;Bordfliegergruppe 196&quot; (shipboard flying group 196). &quot;Trägergeschwader 186&quot; (Carrier Air Wing 186) operated two &quot;Gruppen&quot; (&quot;Trägergruppe I/186&quot; and &quot;Trägergruppe II/186&quot;) equipped with navalized Messerschmitt Bf 109T and Junkers Ju 87C Stuka; these units were intended to serve aboard the aircraft carrier which was never completed, yet provided the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; with some air-power from bases on land. Five coastal groups (&quot;Küstenfliegergruppen&quot;) with reconnaissance aircraft, torpedo bombers, &quot;Minensuch&quot; aerial minesweepers, and air-sea rescue seaplanes supported the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, although with lesser resources as the war progressed.

===Coastal artillery, flak and radar units===
The coastal batteries of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; were stationed on the German coasts. With the conquering and occupation of other countries coastal artillery was stationed along the coasts of these countries, especially in France and Norway as part of the Atlantic Wall. Naval bases were protected by flak-batteries of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; against enemy air raids. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; also manned the &quot;Seetakt&quot; sea radars on the coasts.

===Marines===

At the beginning of World War II, on 1 September 1939, the &quot;Marine Stoßtrupp Kompanie&quot; (Naval Shock Troop Company) landed in Danzig from the old battleship for conquering a Polish bastion at Westerplatte. A reinforced platoon of the &quot;Marine Stoßtrupp Kompanie&quot; landed with soldiers of the German Army from destroyers on 9 April 1940 in Narvik. In June 1940 the &quot;Marine Stoßtrupp Abteilung&quot; (Marine Attack Troop Battalion) was flown in from France to the Channel Islands to occupy this British territory.

In September 1944 amphibious units unsuccessfully tried to capture the strategic island Suursaari in the Gulf of Finland from Germany&#x27;s former ally Finland (Operation Tanne Ost).

With the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 and the Soviet advance from the summer of 1944 the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; started to form regiments and divisions for the battles on land with superfluous personnel. With the loss of naval bases because of the Allied advance more and more navy personnel were available for the ground troops of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. About 40 regiments were raised and from January 1945 on six divisions. Half of the regiments were absorbed by the divisions.

===Personnel strength===
===Ranks and uniforms===
Many different types of uniforms were worn by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;; here is a list of the main ones:
* &quot;Dienstanzug&quot; (Service suit)
* &quot;Kleiner Dienstanzug&quot; (Lesser service uniform)
* &quot;Ausgehanzug&quot; (Suit for walking out)
* &quot;Sportanzug&quot; (Sportswear)
* &quot;Tropen-und Sommeranzug&quot; (Tropical and summer suit) – uniforms for hot climates
* &quot;Große Uniform&quot; (Parade uniform)
* &quot;Kleiner Gesellschaftsanzug&quot; (Small party suit)
* &quot;Großer Gesellschaftsanzug&quot; (Full dress uniform)

<text>The Knights of Labor (K of L), officially the Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor, was an American labor federation that was active in the late 19th century, especially the 1880s. It operated in the United States as well in Canada, and had chapters also in Great Britain and Australia. Its most important leader was Terence V. Powderly. The Knights of Labor promoted the social and cultural uplift of the worker, and demanded the eight-hour day. In some cases it acted as a labor union, negotiating with employers, but it was never well organized or funded. It was notable in its ambition to organize across lines of gender and race and in the inclusion of both skilled and unskilled labor. After a rapid expansion in the mid-1880s, it suddenly lost its new members and became a small operation again. The Knights of Labor had served, however, as the first mass organization of the white working class of the United States.

Founded by Uriah Stephens on December 28, 1869, the Knights of Labor reached 28,000 members in 1880, then jumped to 100,000 in 1884. By 1886, 20% of all workers were affiliated with the Knights of Labor, which equals nearly 800,000 members. Its frail organizational structure could not cope as charges of failure, violence, and calumnies of the association with the Haymarket Square riot battered it. Most members abandoned the movement in 1886–1887, leaving at most 100,000 members in 1890. Many opted to join groups that helped to identify their specific needs, instead of the KOL which addressed many different types of issues. The Panic of 1893 terminated the Knights of Labor&#x27;s importance. While their national headquarters closed in 1917, remnants of the Knights of Labor continued in existence until 1949, when the group&#x27;s last 50-member local dropped its affiliation.

==Origins==
In 1869, Uriah Smith Stephens, James L. Wright, and a small group of Philadelphia tailors founded a secret organization known as the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor. The collapse of the National Labor Union in 1873 left a vacuum for workers looking for organization. The Knights became better organized with a national vision when, in 1879, they replaced Stephens with Terence V. Powderly, who was just 30 years old at the time. The body became popular with trade unions and Pennsylvania coal miners during the economic depression of the mid-1870s, then it grew rapidly. The KOL was a diverse industrial union open to all workers. The leaders felt that it was best to have a versatile population in order to get points of view from all aspects. The Knights of Labor barred five groups from membership: bankers, land speculators, lawyers, liquor dealers and gamblers. Its members included low skilled workers, railroad workers, immigrants, and steel workers. This helped the workers to get an organizational identity. As one of the largest labor organization in nineteenth century, Knights wanted to classify the workers as it was a time where large scale factories and industries were rapidly growing. Even though skilled workers were prioritized at the beginning 1880s but slowly later by the time of 1886, nearly a million workers were enrolled. 
As membership expanded, the Knights began to function more as a labor union and less as a secret organization. During the 1880s, the Knights of Labor played a massive role in independent and third-party movements. Local assemblies began to emphasize cooperative enterprises and initiate strikes to win concessions from employers. The Knights of Labor brought together workers of different religions, races, and genders and helped them all create a bond and unify all for the exact cause. The new leader, Powderly, opposed strikes as a &quot;relic of barbarism&quot;, but the size and the diversity of the Knights afforded local assemblies a great deal of autonomy.   

In 1882, the Knights ended their membership rituals and removed the words &quot;Noble Order&quot; from their name. This was intended to mollify the concerns of Catholic members and the bishops who wanted to avoid any resemblance to freemasonry. Though initially averse to strikes to advance their goals, the Knights did aid various strikes and boycotts. The Wabash Railroad strike in 1885 saw Powderly finally adapt and support an eventually successful strike against Jay Gould&#x27;s Wabash Line after C. A. Hall, a carpenter and Knights member, was fired for attending a meeting in February. The strike included stopping track, yard, engine maintenance, the control or sabotage of equipment, and the occupation of shops and roundhouses. Gould met with Powderly and agreed to call off his campaign against the Knights of Labor, which had caused the turmoil originally. This gave momentum to the Knights and membership surged. By 1886, the Knights had more than 700,000 members.

The Knights&#x27; primary demand was for the eight-hour workday. They also called for legislation to end child and convict labor as well as a graduated income tax. They also supported cooperatives. The only woman to hold office in the Knights of Labor, Leonora Barry, worked as an investigator. She described the horrific conditions in factories employing women and children. These reports made Barry the first person to collect national statistics on the American working woman.

Powderly and the Knights tried to avoid divisive political issues, but in the early 1880s, many Knights had become followers of Henry George&#x27;s ideology known now as Georgism. In 1883, Powderly officially recommended George&#x27;s book and announced his support of &quot;single tax&quot; on land values. During the New York mayoral election of 1886, Powderly was able to successfully push the organization towards the favor of Henry George. In 1886, the Knights became of the part of the short lived United Labor Party, an alliance of labor organizations formed in support of George&#x27;s campaign in the 1886 New York City mayoral election.

The Knights of Labor helped to bring together many different types of people from all different walks of life; for example Catholic and Protestant Irish-born workers. The KOL appealed to them because they worked very closely with the Irish Land League. The Knights had a mixed record on inclusiveness and exclusiveness. They accepted women and blacks (after 1878) and their employers as members, and advocating the admission of blacks into local assemblies. However, the organization tolerated the segregation of assemblies in the South. Bankers, doctors, lawyers, stockholders, and liquor manufacturers were excluded because they were considered unproductive members of society. Asians were also excluded, and in November 1885, a branch of the Knights in Tacoma, Washington violently expelled the city&#x27;s Chinese workers, who amounted to nearly a tenth of the overall city population at the time. The Union Pacific Railroad came into conflict with the Knights. When the Knights in Wyoming refused to work more hours in 1885, the railroad hired Chinese workers as strikebreakers and to stir up racial animosity. The result was the Rock Springs massacre, that killed scores of Chinese workers, and drove the rest out of Wyoming. About 50 African-American sugar-cane laborers organized by the Knights went on strike and were murdered by strikebreakers in the 1887 Thibodaux massacre in Louisiana. The Knights strongly supported passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Contract Labor Law of 1885, as did many other labor groups, demonstrating the limits of their commitment to solidarity. While they claimed to not be &quot;against immigration&quot;, their anti-Asian racism demonstrated the limits and inconsistency of their anti-racist platform.

== Demands ==
The Knights aimed to educate and uplift workers and negotiate salaries and contracts with employers. The Knights had a few primary demands that they wanted to see established. For one, they wanted the workers to see a proper share of the wealth that they created; in other words, they tried to diminish or at least decrease the wage gap. They wanted to educate workers, create cooperative institutions, and enact labor laws such as child labor laws. The Knights also wanted to make sure that workers were protected and that their workplace was improved. The 8-hour workday was something that became very important to the Knights.

==Decline==

===Southwest railroad strike of 1886===

The Great Southwest railroad strike of 1886 was a Knights strike involving more than 200,000 workers. Beginning on March 1, 1886, railroad workers in five states struck against the Union Pacific and Missouri Pacific railroads, owned by Jay Gould. At least ten people were killed. The unravelling of the strike within two months led directly to the collapse of the Knights of Labor and the formation of the American Federation of Labor.

In 1886, right after the Knights of Labor&#x27;s peak, they started losing more members to the American Federation of Labor. The Knights of Labor&#x27;s fall is believed to have been due to their lack of adaptability and beliefs in old-style industrial capitalism. Another large reason for their decline was the tension between skilled craftsmen and unskilled workers.  

===Catholic Church===
The Knights of Labor attracted many Catholics, who were a large part of the membership, perhaps a majority. Powderly was also a Catholic. However, the Knights&#x27;s use of secrecy, similar to the Masons, during its early years concerned many bishops of the Church. The Knights used secrecy and deception to help prevent employers from firing members.

After the Archbishop of Quebec condemned the Knights in 1884, twelve American archbishops voted 10 to 2 against doing likewise in the United States. Furthermore, Cardinal James Gibbons and Bishop John Ireland defended the Knights. Gibbons went to the Vatican to talk to the hierarchy.

In 1886, right after the peak of the Knights of Labor, they started to lose more members to the American Federation of Labor. It has been believed that the fall of the Knights of Labor was due to their lack of adaptability and beliefs in the old-style industrial capitalism.

=== Unskilled vs. Skilled Workers ===
Scholars pit the skilled and unskilled workers as another reason for the Knights of Labor&#x27;s downfall. The Union worked for both groups, but since the results of the union efforts often benefited one or the other and not both, the tension persisted. Unskilled workers often benefited from equal opportunities. Skilled workers would become upset when someone took their jobs with less skill. Skilled workers benefit from better pay, but many unskilled workers do not receive those benefits. This tension caused many to stay away from the Knights of Labor and ultimately caused many members to leave.

==Legacy==

Though often overlooked, the Knights of Labor contributed to the tradition of labor protest songs in America. The Knights frequently included music in their regular meetings, and encouraged local members to write and perform their work. In Chicago, James and Emily Talmadge, printers and supporters of the Knights of Labor, published the songbook &quot;Labor Songs Dedicated to the Knights of Labor&quot; (1885). The song &quot;Hold the Fort&quot; [also &quot;Storm the Fort&quot;], a Knights of Labor pro-labor revision of the hymn by the same name, became the most popular labor song prior to Ralph Chaplin&#x27;s IWW (Industrial Workers of the World) anthem &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;. Pete Seeger often performed this song and it appears on a number of his recordings. Songwriter and labor singer Bucky Halker includes the Talmadge version, entitled &quot;Our Battle Song,&quot; on his CD &quot;Don&#x27;t Want Your Millions&quot; (Revolting Records 2000). Halker also draws heavily on the Knights songs and poems in his book on labor song and poetry, &quot;For Democracy, Workers and God: Labor Song-Poems and Labor Protest, 1865-1895&quot; (University of Illinois Press, 1991).

===Racism and wages===
The Knights of Labor supported the Chinese Exclusion Act, claiming that industrialists were using Chinese workers as a wedge to keep wages low. To stop companies from doing this, they supported Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and also the Alien Contract labor law 1885. Even though the Acts were useful to pass the laws they wanted, they weren&#x27;t satisfied so they attacked Chinese workers and burned down their places.

Not only did the Knights of Labor speak poorly about the Chinese, but they happened to be one of the only groups they excluded from their group. Immigrants of countries from non-Western Europe were considered to be second-class citizens at this time. This may be a large contributing factor as to why the Chinese were excluded from the Knights of Labor. “Only at accepting Chinese did the Knights generally draw the line,” Alexander Saxton wrote. The Knights of Labor consistently made efforts towards many problems in the workforce but often left out any advances that would benefit the Chinese communities. 

Anti-Chinese rhetoric and violence were more prevalent among the western chapters of the Knights. In 1880, San Francisco Knights wrote, &quot;They bear the semblance of men, but live like beasts...who eat rice and the offal of the slaughter house.&quot; The article also calls Chinese &quot;natural thieves&quot; and states that all Chinese women are prostitutes. In March 1882, Knights joined the San Francisco rally to demand expulsion of the Chinese. Several years later, mobs led by the Knights of Labor, a loosely structured labor federation, rounded up Seattle&#x27;s Chinese-born workers and campaigned to prevent further immigration.

Historian Catharine Collomp notes that &quot;Chinese exclusion was the only issue about which the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor constantly lobbied the Federal government.&quot;

=== Haymarket Riot ===
The labor movement, including those in the Knights of Labor, were rallying for an eight-hour workday and protesting with their slogan: &quot;Eight Hours for Work, Eight Hours for Rest, Eight Hours for What We Will.&quot; Through Eight Hour rallies and legislative lobbying, labor leaders came into direct conflict with employers, who neither accepted unions nor believed that governments should intervene on workers&#x27; behalf. During an Eight Hour campaign in Chicago in 1886, a conflict between organized laborers and employers turned violent. By the mid-1880s, Chicago was the center of immigrant and working-class organizing, with a wide array of labor organizations. Demands for the eight-hour workday were at the heart of a strike against one of Chicago&#x27;s most powerful employers, the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, which refused to bargain with the union.

While workingmen had gathered to strike against the plant, some of them had drawn fire from authorities. City police and private guards had injured and killed some of the strikers. Which prompted responses from a bigger working class, which included anarchists Albert Parsons, Michael Schwab, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, and labor organizer Oscar Neebe. On May 4, they organized a protest in Chicago&#x27;s Haymarket Square. After the main speakers, Parson and Spies, left the platform, someone from the crowd threw a bomb into a group of police standing in the square, which left seven police dead, and sixty protesters from the crowd injured. Afterwards, the eight anarchists were arrested and seven of them were sentenced to death in a trial that focused on political beliefs, not the actions of the anarchists. Two of the condemned had their sentences commuted; but after Louis Lingg committed suicide in prison, the remaining four were executed.

The Haymarket trial had two distinct effects on the labor movement: first, a nationwide campaign to round up anarchists and, second, a steep decline in the Knights of Labor&#x27;s membership. Terence Powderly, the Knights president, disavowed the Haymarket eight, even as local trade unions and Knights assemblies around the country protested the arrests. Rapid growth of the labor union in the mid-1880s weakened the bonds that held it together, New Knights members had joined the organization in the wake of its victories over southwestern railroads, but without fully understanding or accepting the Knights&#x27; movement culture. While it would be over a decade before the Knights disbanded, these organizational weaknesses, and the strength of the new trade federation union, led to the Knights&#x27; decline.

<doc id="17390" wikidata="Q421669" url="?curid=17390" title="Kryptonite">
<text>Kryptonite is a fictional material that appears primarily in Superman stories published by DC Comics. In its best-known form, it is a green, crystalline material originating from Superman&#x27;s home world of Krypton that emits a unique, poisonous radiation that can weaken and even kill Kryptonians. Kryptonite radiation can be transmitted through any element except lead. There are other varieties of kryptonite, such as red and gold kryptonite, which have different but still generally negative effects.

Adversaries of Superman and other characters are frequently depicted using kryptonite against Superman, with Lex Luthor incorporating it into weapons, Metallo being powered by it, and Titano being able to project rays of kryptonite radiation from his eyes after being altered by simultaneous exposure to kryptonite and uranium. Due to Superman&#x27;s popularity, kryptonite has become a byword for an extraordinary exploitable weakness, synonymous with &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot;. 

==History==

An unpublished 1940 story titled &quot;The K-Metal from Krypton&quot;, written by Superman creator Jerry Siegel, featured a prototype of kryptonite. It is a mineral from the planet Krypton that drains Superman of his strength and gives superhuman powers to humans. This story was rejected because Superman reveals his identity to Lois Lane.

The mineral kryptonite, not to be confused with the real element krypton, was first officially introduced in the radio serial &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, in the story &quot;The Meteor from Krypton&quot;, broadcast in June 1943. An apocryphal story claims that kryptonite was introduced to give Superman&#x27;s voice actor Bud Collyer time off. This tale was recounted by Julius Schwartz in his memoir. However, the historian Michael J. Hayde disputes this: in &quot;The Meteor From Krypton&quot;, Superman is never exposed to kryptonite. If kryptonite allowed Collyer to take vacations, that was a fringe benefit discovered later. More likely, kryptonite was introduced as a plot device for Superman to discover his origin. On the other hand, Hayde might have mistaken 1945&#x27;s &quot;The Meteor of Kryptonite&quot; for 1943&#x27;s &quot;The Meteor from Krypton&quot;, as Superman was exposed in the former but not in the latter.

In the radio serial, Krypton is located in the same solar system as Earth, in the same orbit, but on the opposite side of the Sun. This provided an easy explanation for how kryptonite found its way to Earth. In the comics&#x27; Silver Age, which places Krypton in a distant solar system, much of the kryptonite that came to Earth was transported by the same &quot;space warp&quot; that baby Kal-El&#x27;s rocket traversed.

Kryptonite was incorporated into the comic mythos with &quot;Superman&quot; #61 (November 1949). Editor Dorothy Woolfolk stated in an interview with &quot;Florida Today&quot; in August 1993 that she felt Superman&#x27;s invulnerability was &quot;boring&quot;.

Long said to be an element in the Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age comics, Kryptonite became a compound post-&quot;Crisis&quot; as revealed in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #591.

==Forms, effects, and other media ==
Various forms of the fictional material have been created over the years in &quot;Superman&quot; publications and programs. This table includes forms that have not persisted in canon.

<doc id="17391" wikidata="Q1246" url="?curid=17391" title="Kosovo">
<text>Kosovo, officially the Republic of Kosovo, is a landlocked country in Southeast Europe with partial diplomatic recognition. It is bordered by Albania to the southwest, Montenegro to the west, Serbia to the north and east, and North Macedonia to the southeast. It covers an area of and has a population of approximately 1.6 million. Kosovo has a varied terrain, with high plains along with rolling hills and mountains, some of which have an altitude over . Its climate is mainly continental with some Mediterranean and alpine influences. Kosovo&#x27;s capital and most populous city is Pristina; other major cities and urban areas include Prizren, Ferizaj, Gjilan and Peja.

The Dardani tribe emerged in Kosovo and established the Kingdom of Dardania in the 4th century BCE. It was later annexed by the Roman Empire in the 1st century BCE. The territory remained in the Byzantine Empire, facing Slavic migrations in the 6th and 7th centuries CE. Control shifted between the Byzantines and the First Bulgarian Empire. In the 13th century, Kosovo became integral to the Serbian medieval state and the establishment of the Serbian Patriarchate. Ottoman expansion in the Balkans in the late 14th and 15th centuries led to the decline and fall of the Serbian Empire; the Battle of Kosovo of 1389, in which a Serbian-led coalition of various ethnicities fought against the Ottoman Empire, is considered one of the defining moments.

Various dynasties, mainly the Branković, governed Kosovo for much of the period after the battle. The Ottoman Empire fully conquered Kosovo after the Second Battle of Kosovo, ruling for nearly five centuries until 1912. Kosovo was the centre of the Albanian Renaissance and experienced the Albanian revolts of 1910 and 1912. After the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), it was ceded to the Kingdom of Serbia, and after World War II, it became an Autonomous Province within Yugoslavia. Tensions between Kosovo&#x27;s Albanian and Serb communities simmered during the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, culminating in the Kosovo War of 1998 and 1999, which resulted in the Yugoslav army&#x27;s withdrawal and the establishment of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.

Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and has since gained diplomatic recognition as a sovereign state by 104 member states of the United Nations. Serbia does not officially recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state and continues to claim it as its constituent Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, but it accepts the governing authority of the Kosovo institutions as part of the 2013 Brussels Agreement.

Kosovo is a developing country, with an upper-middle-income economy. It has experienced solid economic growth over the last decade as measured by international financial institutions since the onset of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Kosovo is a member of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, EBRD, Venice Commission, and the International Olympic Committee, and has applied for membership in the Council of Europe, UNESCO, and Interpol, and for observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. In December 2022, Kosovo filed a formal application to become a member of the European Union.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Kosovo&quot; is of South Slavic origin. () is the Serbian neuter possessive adjective of (), &#x27;blackbird&#x27;, an ellipsis for , &#x27;Blackbird Field&#x27;, the name of a karst field situated in the eastern half of today&#x27;s Kosovo and the site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo Field. The name of the karst field was for the first time applied to a wider area when the Ottoman Vilayet of Kosovo was created in 1877.

The entire territory that corresponds to today&#x27;s country is commonly referred to in English simply as &quot;Kosovo&quot; and in Albanian as (definite form) or (indefinite form, ). In Serbia, a formal distinction is made between the eastern and western areas of the country; the term () is used for the eastern part of Kosovo centred on the historical Kosovo Field, while the western part of the territory of Kosovo is called &quot;Metohija&quot; (). Thus, in Serbian the entire area of Kosovo is referred to as &quot;Kosovo and Metohija&quot;.

Dukagjini or Dukagjini plateau (Albanian: &#x27;Rrafshi i Dukagjinit&#x27;) is an alternative name for Western Kosovo, having been in use since the 15th–16th century as part of the Sanjak of Dukakin with its capital Peja, and is named after the medieval Albanian Dukagjini family.

=== Modern usage ===

Some Albanians also prefer to refer to Kosovo as &quot;Dardania&quot;, the name of an ancient kingdom and later Roman province, which covered the territory of modern-day Kosovo. The name is derived from the ancient tribe of the &quot;Dardani&quot;, which is considered be related to the Proto-Albanian term &quot;dardā&quot;, which means &quot;pear&quot; (Modern Albanian: ). The former Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova had been an enthusiastic backer of a &quot;Dardanian&quot; identity, and the Kosovar presidential flag and seal refer to this national identity. However, the name &quot;Kosova&quot; remains more widely used among the Albanian population. The flag of Dardania remains in use as the official Presidential seal and standard and is heavily featured in the institution of the presidency of the country.

The official conventional long name, as defined by the constitution, is &quot;Republic of Kosovo&quot;. Additionally, as a result of an arrangement agreed between Pristina and Belgrade in talks mediated by the European Union, Kosovo has participated in some international forums and organisations under the title &quot;Kosovo*&quot; with a footnote stating, &quot;This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSC 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence&quot;. This arrangement, which has been dubbed the &quot;asterisk agreement&quot;, was agreed in an 11-point arrangement on 24 February 2012.

== History ==

=== Ancient history ===

The strategic position including the abundant natural resources were favourable for the development of human settlements in Kosovo, as is highlighted by the hundreds of archaeological sites identified throughout its territory.

Since 2000, the increase in archaeological expeditions has revealed many, previously unknown sites. The earliest documented traces in Kosovo are associated to the Stone Age; namely, indications that cave dwellings might have existed, such as Radivojce Cave near the source of the Drin River, Grnčar Cave in Viti municipality and the Dema and Karamakaz Caves in the municipality of Peja.

The earliest archaeological evidence of organised settlement, which have been found in Kosovo, belong to the Neolithic Starčevo and Vinča cultures. Vlashnjë and Runik are important sites of the Neolithic era with the rock art paintings at Mrrizi i Kobajës near Vlashnjë being the first find of prehistoric art in Kosovo. Amongst the finds of excavations in Neolithic Runik is a baked-clay ocarina, which is the first musical instrument recorded in Kosovo.

The first archaeological expedition in Kosovo was organised by the Austro-Hungarian army during the World War I in the Illyrian tumuli burial grounds of Nepërbishti within the district of Prizren.

The beginning of the Bronze Age coincides with the presence of tumuli burial grounds in western Kosovo, like the site of Romajë.

The Dardani were the most important Paleo-Balkan tribe in the region of Kosovo. A wide area which consists of Kosovo, parts of Northern Macedonia and eastern Serbia was named Dardania after them in classical antiquity, reaching to the Thraco-Illyrian contact zone in the east. In archaeological research, Illyrian names are predominant in western Dardania, while Thracian names are mostly found in eastern Dardania.

Thracian names are absent in western Dardania, while some Illyrian names appear in the eastern parts. Thus, their identification as either an Illyrian or Thracian tribe has been a subject of debate, the ethnolinguistic relationship between the two groups being largely uncertain and debated itself as well. The correspondence of Illyrian names, including those of the ruling elite, in Dardania with those of the southern Illyrians suggests a thracianisation of parts of Dardania. The Dardani retained an individuality and continued to maintain social independence after Roman conquest, playing an important role in the formation of new groupings in the Roman era.

==== Roman period ====
During Roman rule, Kosovo was part of two provinces, with its western part being part of Praevalitana, and the vast majority of its modern territory belonging to Dardania. Praevalitana and the rest of Illyria was conquered by the Roman Republic in 168 BC. On the other hand, Dardania maintained its independence until the year 28 BC, when the Romans, under Augustus, annexed it into their Republic. Dardania eventually became a part of the Moesia province. During the reign of Diocletian, Dardania became a full Roman province and the entirety of Kosovo&#x27;s modern territory became a part of the Diocese of Moesia, and then during the second half of the 4th century, it became part of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum.
During Roman rule, a series of settlements developed in the area, mainly close to mines and to the major roads. The most important of the settlements was Ulpiana, which is located near modern-day Gračanica. It was established in the 1st century AD, possibly developing from a concentrated Dardanian oppidum, and then was upgraded to the status of a Roman municipium at the beginning of the 2nd century during the rule of Trajan. Ulpiana became especially important during the rule of Justinian I, after the Emperor rebuilt the city after it had been destroyed by an earthquake and renamed it to &quot;Iustinianna Secunda&quot;.

Other important towns that developed in the area during Roman rule were Vendenis, located in modern-day Podujevë; Viciano, possibly near Vushtrri; and Municipium Dardanorum, an important mining town in Leposavić. Other archeological sites include Çifllak in Western Kosovo, Dresnik in Klina, Pestova in Vushtrri, Vërban in Klokot, Poslishte between Vërmica and Prizren, Paldenica near Hani i Elezit, as well as Nerodimë e Poshtme and Nikadin near Ferizaj. The one thing all the settlements have in common is that they are located either near roads, such as Via Lissus-Naissus, or near the mines of North Kosovo and eastern Kosovo. Most of the settlements are archaeological sites that have been discovered recently and are being excavated.

It is also known that the region was Christianised during Roman rule, though little is known regarding Christianity in the Balkans in the three first centuries AD. The first clear mention of Christians in literature is the case of Bishop Dacus of Macedonia, from Dardania, who was present at the First Council of Nicaea (325). It is also known that Dardania had a Diocese in the 4th century, and its seat was placed in Ulpiana, which remained the episcopal centre of Dardania until the establishment of Justiniana Prima in 535 AD. The first known bishop of Ulpiana is Machedonius, who was a member of the council of Serdika. Other known bishops were Paulus (synod of Constantinople in 553 AD), and Gregentius, who was sent by Justin I to Ethiopia and Yemen to ease problems among different Christian groups there.

=== Middle Ages ===

In the next centuries, Kosovo was a frontier province of the Roman, and later of the Byzantine Empire, and as a result it changed hands frequently. The region was exposed to an increasing number of raids from the 4th century CE onward, culminating with the Slavic migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries. Toponymic evidence suggests that Albanian was probably spoken in Kosovo prior to the Slavic settlement of the region. The overwhelming presence of towns and municipalities in Kosovo with Slavic in their toponymy suggests that the Slavic migrations either assimilated or drove out population groups already living in Kosovo.

There is one intriguing line of argument to suggest that the Slav presence in Kosovo and southernmost part of the Morava valley may have been quite weak in the first one or two centuries of Slav settlement. Only in the ninth century can the expansion of a strong Slav (or quasi-Slav) power into this region be observed. Under a series of ambitious rulers, the Bulgarians pushed westwards across modern Macedonia and eastern Serbia, until by the 850&#x27;s they had taken over Kosovo and were pressing on the border of Serbian Principality.

The First Bulgarian Empire acquired Kosovo by the mid-9th century, but Byzantine control was restored by the late 10th century. In 1072, the leaders of the Bulgarian Uprising of Georgi Voiteh traveled from their centre in Skopje to Prizren and held a meeting in which they invited Mihailo Vojislavljević of Duklja to send them assistance. Mihailo sent his son, Constantine Bodin with 300 of his soldiers. After they met, the Bulgarian magnates proclaimed him &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians&quot;. Demetrios Chomatenos is the last Byzantine archbishop of Ohrid to include Prizren in his jurisdiction until 1219. Stefan Nemanja had seized the area along the White Drin in 1185 to 1195 and the ecclesiastical split of Prizren from the Patriarchate in 1219 was the final act of establishing Nemanjić rule. Konstantin Jireček concluded, from the correspondence of archbishop Demetrios of Ohrid from 1216 to 1236, that Dardania was increasingly populated by Albanians and the expansion started from Gjakova and Prizren area, prior to the Slavic expansion.

During the 13th and 14th centuries, Kosovo was a political, cultural and religious centre of the Serbian Kingdom. In the late 13th century, the seat of the Serbian Archbishopric was moved to Peja, and rulers centred themselves between Prizren and Skopje, during which time thousands of Christian monasteries and feudal-style forts and castles were erected, with Stefan Dušan using Prizren Fortress as one of his temporary courts for a time. When the Serbian Empire fragmented into a conglomeration of principalities in 1371, Kosovo became the hereditary land of the House of Branković. During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, parts of Kosovo, the easternmost area located near Pristina, were part of the Principality of Dukagjini, which was later incorporated into an anti-Ottoman federation of all Albanian principalities, the League of Lezhë.

Medieval Monuments in Kosovo is a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site consisting of four Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries in Deçan, Peja, Prizren and Gračanica. The constructions were founded by members of the Nemanjić dynasty, a prominent dynasty of mediaeval Serbia.

==== Ottoman rule ====

In 1389, as the Ottoman Empire expanded northwards through the Balkans, Ottoman forces under Sultan Murad I met with a Christian coalition led by Moravian Serbia under Prince Lazar in the Battle of Kosovo. Both sides suffered heavy losses and the battle was a stalemate and it was even reported as a Christian victory at first, but Serbian manpower was depleted and &quot;de facto&quot; Serbian rulers could not raise another equal force to the Ottoman army.

Different parts of Kosovo were ruled directly or indirectly by the Ottomans in this early period. The medieval town of Novo Brdo was under Lazar&#x27;s son, Stefan who became a loyal Ottoman vassal and instigated the downfall of Vuk Branković who eventually joined the Hungarian anti-Ottoman coalition and was defeated in 1395–96. A small part of Vuk&#x27;s land with the villages of Pristina and Vushtrri was given to his sons to hold as Ottoman vassals for a brief period.

By 1455–57, the Ottoman Empire assumed direct control of all of Kosovo and the region remained part of the empire until 1912. During this period, Islam was introduced to the region. After the failed siege of Vienna by the Ottoman forces in 1693 during the Great Turkish War, a number of Serbs that lived in Kosovo, Macedonia and south Serbia migrated northwards near the Danube and Sava rivers, and is one of the events known as the great migrations of the Serbs which also included some Christian Albanians. The Albanians and Serbs who stayed in Kosovo after the war faced waves of Ottoman and Tatar forces, who unleashed a savage retaliation on the local population. To compensate for the population loss, the Turks encouraged settlement of non-Slav Muslim Albanians in the wider region of Kosovo. By the end of the 18th century, Kosovo would reattain an Albanian majority – with Peja, Prizren, Prishtina becoming especially important towns for the local Muslim population.

Although initially stout opponents of the advancing Turks, Albanian chiefs ultimately came to accept the Ottomans as sovereigns. The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, the spread of Islam greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Centuries earlier, Albanians of Kosovo were predominantly Christian and Albanians and Serbs for the most part co-existed peacefully. The Ottomans appeared to have a more deliberate approach to converting the Roman Catholic population who were mostly Albanians in comparison with the mostly Serbian adherents of Eastern Orthodoxy, as they viewed the former less favourably due to its allegiance to Rome, a competing regional power.

==== Rise of nationalism ====

In the 19th century, there was an awakening of ethnic nationalism throughout the Balkans. The underlying ethnic tensions became part of a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians. The ethnic Albanian nationalism movement was centred in Kosovo. In 1878 the League of Prizren () was formed, a political organisation that sought to unify all the Albanians of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater cultural rights, although they generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire. The League was dis-established in 1881 but enabled the awakening of a national identity among Albanians, whose ambitions competed with those of the Serbs, the Kingdom of Serbia wishing to incorporate this land that had formerly been within its empire.

The modern Albanian-Serbian conflict has its roots in the expulsion of the Albanians in 1877–1878 from areas that became incorporated into the Principality of Serbia. During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Niš and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet. According to Austrian data, by the 1890s Kosovo was 70% Muslim (nearly entirely of Albanian descent) and less than 30% non-Muslim (primarily Serbs). In May 1901, Albanians pillaged and partially burned the cities of Novi Pazar, Sjenica and Pristina, and killed many Serbs near Pristina and in Kolašin (now North Kosovo).
In the spring of 1912, Albanians under the lead of Hasan Prishtina revolted against the Ottoman Empire. The rebels were joined by a wave of Albanians in the Ottoman army ranks, who deserted the army, refusing to fight their own kin. The rebels defeated the Ottomans and the latter were forced to accept all fourteen demands of the rebels, which foresaw an effective autonomy for the Albanians living in the Empire. However, this autonomy never materialised, and the revolt created serious weaknesses in the Ottoman ranks, luring Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece into declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and starting the First Balkan War.

After the Ottomans&#x27; defeat in the First Balkan War, the 1913 Treaty of London was signed with Metohija ceded to the Kingdom of Montenegro and eastern Kosovo ceded to the Kingdom of Serbia. During the Balkan Wars, over 100,000 Albanians left Kosovo and about 50,000 were killed in the massacres that accompanied the war. Soon, there were concerted Serbian colonisation efforts in Kosovo during various periods between Serbia&#x27;s 1912 takeover of the province and World War II, causing the population of Serbs in Kosovo to grow by about 58,000 in this period.

Serbian authorities promoted creating new Serb settlements in Kosovo as well as the assimilation of Albanians into Serbian society, causing a mass exodus of Albanians from Kosovo. The figures of Albanians forcefully expelled from Kosovo range between 60,000 and 239,807, while Malcolm mentions 100,000–120,000. In combination with the politics of extermination and expulsion, there was also a process of assimilation through religious conversion of Albanian Muslims and Albanian Catholics into the Serbian Orthodox religion which took place as early as 1912. These politics seem to have been inspired by the nationalist ideologies of Ilija Garašanin and Jovan Cvijić.

In the winter of 1915–16, during World War I, Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary. In 1918, the Allied Powers pushed the Central Powers out of Kosovo.


A new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts (oblast) of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Raška and Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the Banate of Zeta, the Banate of Morava and the Banate of Vardar. In order to change the ethnic composition of Kosovo, between 1912 and 1941 a large-scale Serbian colonisation of Kosovo was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Kosovar Albanians&#x27; right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia. Other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations and non-Slav nations deemed as minorities.

Albanians and other Muslims were forced to emigrate, mainly with the land reform which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures. In 1935 and 1938, two agreements between the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Turkey were signed on the expatriation of 240,000 Albanians to Turkey, but the expatriation did not occur due to the outbreak of World War II.

After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, and the rest was controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations. Albanian collaborators persecuted Serb and Montenegrin settlers. Estimates differ, but most authors estimate that between 3,000 and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins died in Kosovo during the Second World War. Another 30,000 to 40,000, or as high as 100,000, Serbs and Montenegrins, mainly settlers, were deported to Serbia in order to Albanianise Kosovo. A decree from Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, followed by a new law in August 1945 disallowed the return of colonists who had taken land from Albanian peasants. During the war years, some Serbs and Montenegrins were sent to concentration camps in Pristina and Mitrovica. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years. Two Serb historians also estimate that 12,000 Albanians died. An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of them Serb or Montenegrin and 2,177 Albanian. Some sources note that up to 72,000 individuals were encouraged to settle or resettle into Kosovo from Albania by the short-lived Italian administration. As the regime collapsed, this was never materialised with historians and contemporary references emphasising that a large-scale migration of Albanians from Albania to Kosovo is not recorded in Axis documents.
=== Communist Yugoslavia ===


The existing province took shape in 1945 as the &quot;Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija&quot;, with a final demarcation in 1959. Until 1945, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo in the late modern period had been the Vilayet of Kosovo, a political unit created by the Ottoman Empire in 1877. However, those borders were different.

Tensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government were significant, not only due to ethnic tensions but also due to political ideological concerns, especially regarding relations with neighbouring Albania. Harsh repressive measures were imposed on Kosovo Albanians due to suspicions that there were sympathisers of the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxha of Albania. In 1956, a show trial in Pristina was held in which multiple Albanian Communists of Kosovo were convicted of being infiltrators from Albania and given long prison sentences. High-ranking Serbian communist official Aleksandar Ranković sought to secure the position of the Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo&#x27;s nomenklatura.

Islam in Kosovo at this time was repressed and both Albanians and Muslim Slavs were encouraged to declare themselves to be Turkish and emigrate to Turkey. At the same time Serbs and Montenegrins dominated the government, security forces, and industrial employment in Kosovo. Albanians resented these conditions and protested against them in the late 1960s, calling the actions taken by authorities in Kosovo colonialist, and demanding that Kosovo be made a republic, or declaring support for Albania.

After the ouster of Ranković in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a Muslim Yugoslav nationality. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo&#x27;s nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs in large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs that they were being made second-class citizens in Yugoslavia. By the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, Kosovo was granted major autonomy, allowing it to have its own administration, assembly, and judiciary; as well as having a membership in the collective presidency and the Yugoslav parliament, in which it held veto power.

In the aftermath of the 1974 constitution, concerns over the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo rose with the widespread celebrations in 1978 of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the League of Prizren. Albanians felt that their status as a &quot;minority&quot; in Yugoslavia had made them second-class citizens in comparison with the &quot;nations&quot; of Yugoslavia and demanded that Kosovo be a constituent republic, alongside the other republics of Yugoslavia. Protests by Albanians in 1981 over the status of Kosovo resulted in Yugoslav territorial defence units being brought into Kosovo and a state of emergency being declared resulting in violence and the protests being crushed. In the aftermath of the 1981 protests, purges took place in the Communist Party, and rights that had been recently granted to Albanians were rescinded – including ending the provision of Albanian professors and Albanian language textbooks in the education system.

While Albanians in the region had the highest birth rates in Europe, other areas of Yugoslavia including Serbia had low birth rates. Increased urbanisation and economic development led to higher settlements of Albanian workers into Serb-majority areas, as Serbs departed in response to the economic climate for more favourable real estate conditions in Serbia. While there was tension, charges of &quot;genocide&quot; and planned harassment have been discredited as a pretext to revoke Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy. For example, in 1986 the Serbian Orthodox Church published an official claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of &#x27;genocide&#x27;.

Even though they were disproved by police statistics, they received wide attention in the Serbian press and that led to further ethnic problems and eventual removal of Kosovo&#x27;s status. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students of the University of Pristina organised protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia and demanding their human rights. The protests were brutally suppressed by the police and army, with many protesters arrested. During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Yugoslav state authorities, resulting in a further increase in emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups. The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.
=== Kosovo War ===

Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In 1989, Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo&#x27;s special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population. Kosovar Albanians responded with a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience and creation of parallel structures in education, medical care, and taxation, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.

In July 1990, the Kosovo Albanians proclaimed the existence of the Republic of Kosova, and declared it a sovereign and independent state in September 1992. In May 1992, Ibrahim Rugova was elected its president. During its lifetime, the Republic of Kosova was only officially recognised by Albania. By the mid-1990s, the Kosovo Albanian population was growing restless, as the status of Kosovo was not resolved as part of the Dayton Agreement of November 1995, which ended the Bosnian War. By 1996, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an ethnic Albanian guerrilla paramilitary group that sought the separation of Kosovo and the eventual creation of a Greater Albania, had prevailed over the Rugova&#x27;s non-violent resistance movement and launched attacks against the Yugoslav Army and Serbian police in Kosovo, resulting in the Kosovo War.

By 1998, international pressure compelled Yugoslavia to sign a ceasefire and partially withdraw its security forces. Events were to be monitored by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observers according to an agreement negotiated by Richard Holbrooke. The ceasefire did not hold and fighting resumed in December 1998, culminating in the Račak massacre, which attracted further international attention to the conflict. Within weeks, a multilateral international conference was convened and by March had prepared a draft agreement known as the Rambouillet Accords, calling for the restoration of Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy and the deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces. The Yugoslav delegation found the terms unacceptable and refused to sign the draft. Between 24 March and 10 June 1999, NATO intervened by bombing Yugoslavia, aiming to force Milošević to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, though NATO could not appeal to any particular motion of the Security Council of the United Nations to help legitimise its intervention. Combined with continued skirmishes between Albanian guerrillas and Yugoslav forces the conflict resulted in a further massive displacement of population in Kosovo.


During the conflict, between 848,000 and 863,000 ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo and an additional 590,000 were internally displaced. Some sources claim that this ethnic cleansing of Albanians was part of a plan known as Operation Horseshoe, described as &quot;Milosevic&#x27;s final solution to the Kosovo problem&quot;. However, the existence and implementation of this plan has not been proven.

During the war, over 90,000 Serbian and other non-Albanian refugees fled the province. In September 1998, Serbian police collected 34 bodies of people believed to have been seized and murdered by the KLA, among them some ethnic Albanians, at Lake Radonjić near Glođane (Gllogjan) in what became known as the Lake Radonjić massacre, the most serious atrocity by the KLA during the conflict. By June, Milošević agreed to a foreign military presence in Kosovo and the withdrawal of his troops. In the days after the Yugoslav Army withdrew, over 80,000 Serb and other non-Albanian civilians (almost half of 200,000 estimated to live in Kosovo) were expelled from Kosovo, and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse. After the Kosovo and other Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to the highest number of refugees and IDPs (including Kosovo Serbs) in Europe.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prosecuted crimes committed during the Kosovo War. Nine senior Yugoslav officials, including Milošević, were indicted for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed between January and June 1999. Six of the defendants were convicted, one was acquitted, one died before his trial could commence, and one (Milošević) died before his trial could conclude. Six KLA members were charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes by the ICTY following the war, and one was convicted.

In total around 10,317 civilians were killed during the war, of whom 8,676 were Albanians, 1,196 Serbs and 445 Roma and others in addition to 3,218 killed members of armed formations.

=== United Nations administration ===


On 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorised Kosovo Force (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.

Estimates of the number of Serbs who left when Serbian forces left Kosovo vary from 65,000 to 250,000. Within post-conflict Kosovo Albanian society, calls for retaliation for previous violence done by Serb forces during the war circulated through public culture. Widespread attacks against Serbian cultural sites commenced following the conflict and the return of hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees to their homes. In 2004, prolonged negotiations over Kosovo&#x27;s future status, sociopolitical problems and nationalist sentiments resulted in the Kosovo unrest. 11 Albanians and 16 Serbs were killed, 900 people (including peacekeepers) were injured, and several houses, public buildings and churches were damaged or destroyed.

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposed &#x27;supervised independence&#x27; for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the United States, the United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council, was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.

Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians. Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally &#x27;discarded&#x27; a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari&#x27;s proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a &quot;&quot; consisting of negotiators from the European Union (Wolfgang Ischinger), the United States (Frank G. Wisner) and Russia (Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko) launched a new effort to reach a status outcome acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. Despite Russian disapproval, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and France appeared likely to recognise Kosovar independence. A declaration of independence by Kosovar Albanian leaders was postponed until the end of the Serbian presidential elections (4 February 2008). A significant portion of politicians in both the EU and the US had feared that a premature declaration could boost support in Serbia for the nationalist candidate, Tomislav Nikolić.

In November 2001, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe supervised the first elections for the Assembly of Kosovo. After that election, Kosovo&#x27;s political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected Ibrahim Rugova as president and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister. After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in Ramush Haradinaj (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused that government of corruption.

Parliamentary elections were held on 17 November 2007. After early results, Hashim Thaçi who was on course to gain 35 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the Democratic Party of Kosovo, and stated his intention to declare independence. Thaçi formed a coalition with president Fatmir Sejdiu&#x27;s Democratic League which was in second place with 22 percent of the vote. The turnout at the election was particularly low. Most members of the Serb minority refused to vote.

=== Declaration of independence ===

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008. recognised its independence, including all of its immediate neighbours, with the exception of Serbia; 10 states have subsequently withdrawn that recognition. Of the UN Security Council members, while the US, UK and France do recognise Kosovo&#x27;s independence, Russia and China do not. Since declaring independence, it has become a member of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, though not of the United Nations.

The Serb minority of Kosovo, which largely opposes the declaration of independence, has formed the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija in response. The creation of the assembly was condemned by Kosovo&#x27;s President Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK has said the assembly is not a serious issue because it will not have an operative role.
On 8 October 2008, the UN General Assembly resolved, on a proposal by Serbia, to ask the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legality of Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence. The advisory opinion, which is not binding over decisions by states to recognise or not recognise Kosovo, was rendered on 22 July 2010, holding that Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence was not in violation either of general principles of international law, which do not prohibit unilateral declarations of independence, nor of specific international law – in particular UNSCR 1244 – which did not define the final status process nor reserve the outcome to a decision of the Security Council.

Some rapprochement between the two governments took place on 19 April 2013 as both parties reached the Brussels Agreement, an agreement brokered by the EU that allowed the Serb minority in Kosovo to have its own police force and court of appeals. The agreement is yet to be ratified by either parliament. Presidents of Serbia and Kosovo organised two meetings, in Brussels on 27 February 2023 and Ohrid on 18 March 2023, to create and agree upon an 11-point agreement on implementing a European Union-backed deal to normalise ties between the two countries, which includes recognising &quot;each other&#x27;s documents such as passports and license plates&quot;.

A number of protests and demonstrations took place in Kosovo between 2021 and 2023, some of which involved weapons and resulted in deaths on both sides. Amongst the injured were 30 NATO peacekeepers. The main reason behind the 2022–23 demonstrations ended on 1 January 2024 when each country recognised each other&#x27;s vehicle registration plates.

== Governance ==

Kosovo is a multi-party parliamentary representative democratic republic. It is governed by legislative, executive and judicial institutions, which derive from the constitution, although, until the Brussels Agreement, North Kosovo was in practice largely controlled by institutions of Serbia or parallel institutions funded by Serbia. Legislative functions are vested in both the Parliament and the ministers within their competencies. The Government exercises the executive power and is composed of the Prime Minister as the head of government, the Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of the various ministries.

The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and subordinate courts, a Constitutional Court, and independent prosecutorial institutions. There also exist multiple independent institutions defined by the constitution and law, as well as local governments. All citizens are equal before the law and gender equality is ensured by the constitution. The Constitutional Framework guarantees a minimum of ten seats in the 120-member Assembly for Serbs, and ten for other minorities, and also guarantees Serbs and other minorities places in the Government.

The president serves as the head of state and represents the unity of the people, elected every five years, indirectly by the parliament through a secret ballot by a two-thirds majority of all deputies. The head of state is invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. The president has the power to return draft legislation to the parliament for reconsideration and has a role in foreign affairs and certain official appointments. The Prime Minister serves as the head of government elected by the parliament. Ministers are nominated by the Prime Minister, and then confirmed by the parliament. The head of government exercises executive power of the territory.

Corruption is a major problem and an obstacle to the development of democracy in the country. Those in the judiciary appointed by the government to fight corruption are often government associates. Moreover, prominent politicians and party operatives who commit offences are not prosecuted due to the lack of laws and political will. Organised crime also poses a threat to the economy due to the practices of bribery, extortion and racketeering.

=== Foreign relations ===
The foreign relations of Kosovo are conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pristina. , 104 out of 193 United Nations member states recognise the Republic of Kosovo. Within the European Union, it is recognised by 22 of 27 members and is a potential candidate for the future enlargement of the European Union. On 15 December 2022 Kosovo filed a formal application to become a member of the European Union.

Kosovo is a member of several international organisations including the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, International Road and Transport Union, Regional Cooperation Council, Council of Europe Development Bank, Venice Commission and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In 2015, Kosovo&#x27;s bid to become a member of UNESCO fell three votes short of the two-thirds majority required to join. 23 countries maintain embassies in Kosovo. Kosovo maintains 24 diplomatic missions and 28 consular missions abroad.

The relations with Albania are in a special case considering that both countries share the same language and culture. The Albanian language is one of the official languages of Kosovo. Albania has an embassy in the capital Pristina and Kosovo an embassy in Tirana. In 1992, Albania was the only country whose parliament voted to recognise the Republic of Kosova. Albania was also one of the first countries to officially announce its recognition of the Republic of Kosovo in February 2008.

From 1 January 2024 Kosovo nationals became exempt from visa requirements within the Schengen Area for periods of up to 90 days in any 180-day period.

=== Law ===


The judicial system of Kosovo follows a civil law framework and comprises regular civil and criminal courts, alongside administrative courts. Administered by the judicial council in Pristina, the system includes the supreme court as the highest judicial authority, a constitutional court and an independent prosecutorial institution. Following the independence of Kosovo in 2008, the Kosovo Police assumed the primary law enforcement responsibilities within the country.

Covering a broad range of issues related to the status of Kosovo, the Ahtisaari Plan introduced two forms of international supervision for Kosovo following its independence, including the International Civilian Office (ICO) and the European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo (EULEX). The ICO monitored plan implementation and possessed veto powers, while EULEX focused on developing judicial systems and had arrest and prosecution authority. These bodies were granted powers under Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence and constitution.

The legal status of the ICO depended upon the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation, with oversight provided by the International Steering Group (ISG) comprising states that recognied Kosovo. Serbia and non-recognising states did not acknowledge the ICO. Despite initial opposition, EULEX gained acceptance from Serbia and the UN Security Council in 2008. It operated under the UNMIK mandate with operational independence. The ICO concluded operations in 2012 after fulfilling obligations, while EULEX continues to operate within Kosovo and international law. Its role has been extended, primarily focusing on monitoring with reduced responsibilities.

According to the Global Safety Report by Gallup, which assesses personal security worldwide through the Law and Order Index Scores for 2023, Kosovo has distinguished itself by ranking among the top ten countries globally in terms of perceived safety and law enforcement effectiveness.
=== Military ===


The Kosovo Security Force (KSF) is the national security force of Kosovo commissioned with the task of preserving and safeguarding the country&#x27;s territorial integrity, national sovereignty and the security interests of its population. Functioning under the president of Kosovo as the commander-in-chief, the security force adheres to the principle of non-discrimination, guaranteeing equal protection for its personnel regardless of gender or ethnicity. Kosovo&#x27;s notable challenges are identified in the realms of persistent conflicts and societal safety and security, both of which are intertwined with the country&#x27;s diplomatic ties to neighboring countries and its domestic social and political stability.

The Kosovo Force (KFOR) is a NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Its operations are gradually reducing until Kosovo&#x27;s Security Force, established in 2009, becomes self-sufficient. KFOR entered Kosovo on 12 June 1999, one day after the United Nations Security Council adopted the UNSC Resolution 1244. Camp Bondsteel is the operation headquarters of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo. It is located near Ferizaj in southeastern Kosovo. It is the Regional Command-East headed by the United States Army (U.S. Army) and it is supported by troops from Greece, Italy, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey.

In 2008, under the leadership of NATO, the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) undertook preparations for the formation of the Kosovo Security Force. A significant milestone occurred in 2014 when the government officially announced its decision to establish a Ministry of Defence by 2019, with the aim of transforming the existing Kosovo Security Force into the Kosovo Armed Forces. This transformation would entail aligning the armed forces with the high standards expected of NATO members, reflecting Kosovo&#x27;s aspiration to join the alliance in the future. Subsequently, in December 2018, the government enacted legislation to redefine the mandate of the Kosovo Security Force, effecting its transformation into an army. Concurrently, the establishment of a Ministry of Defence was set in motion, further solidifying these developments and ensuring the necessary infrastructure and oversight for the newly formed armed forces.

In 2023, the Kosovo Security Force had over 5,000 active members, using vehicles and weapons acquired from a number of NATO countries. KFOR continues to operate in Kosovo under its UN mandate.

== Administrative divisions ==

Kosovo is divided into seven districts (; ), according to the Law of Kosovo and the Brussels Agreement of 2013, which stipulated the formation of new municipalities with Serb majority populations. The districts are further subdivided into 38 municipalities (; ). The largest and most populous district of Kosovo is the District of Pristina with the capital in Pristina, having a surface area of and a population of 477,312.


== Geography ==


Defined in a total area of , Kosovo is landlocked and located in the centre of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe. It lies between latitudes 42° and 43° N, and longitudes 20° and 22° E. The northernmost point is Bellobërda at 43° 14&#x27; 06&quot; northern latitude; the southernmost is Restelicë at 41° 56&#x27; 40&quot; northern latitude; the westernmost point is Bogë at 20° 3&#x27; 23&quot; eastern longitude; and the easternmost point is Desivojca at 21° 44&#x27; 21&quot; eastern longitude. The highest point of Kosovo is Gjeravica at above sea level, and the lowest is the White Drin at .

Most of the borders of Kosovo are dominated by mountainous and high terrain. The most noticeable topographical features are the Accursed Mountains and the Šar Mountains. The Accursed Mountains are a geological continuation of the Dinaric Alps. The mountains run laterally through the west along the border with Albania and Montenegro. The southeast is predominantly the Šar Mountains, which constitute the border with North Macedonia. Besides the mountain ranges, Kosovo&#x27;s territory consists mostly of two major plains, the Kosovo Plain in the east and the Metohija Plain in the west.

Additionally, Kosovo consists of multiple geographic and ethnographic regions, such as Drenica, Dushkaja, Gollak, Has, Highlands of Gjakova, Llap, Llapusha and Rugova.

Kosovo&#x27;s hydrological resources are relatively small; there are few lakes in Kosovo, the largest of which are Lake Batllava, Badovc Lake, Lake Gazivoda, Lake Radoniq. In addition to these, Kosovo also does have karst springs, thermal and mineral water springs. The longest rivers of Kosovo include the White Drin, the South Morava and the Ibar. Sitnica, a tributary of Ibar, is the largest river lying completely within Kosovo&#x27;s territory. Nerodime river represents Europe&#x27;s only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into the Black Sea and Aegean Sea.
=== Climate ===


Most of Kosovo experiences predominantly a Continental climate with Mediterranean and Alpine influences, strongly influenced by Kosovo&#x27;s proximity to the Adriatic Sea in the west, the Aegean Sea in the south as well as the European continental landmass in the north.

The coldest areas are situated in the mountainous region to the west and southeast, where an Alpine climate is prevalent. The warmest areas are mostly in the extreme southern areas close to the border with Albania, where a Mediterranean climate is the norm. Mean monthly temperature ranges between (in January) and (in July). Mean annual precipitation ranges from per year, and is well distributed year-round.

To the northeast, the Kosovo Plain and Ibar Valley are drier with total precipitation of about per year and more influenced by continental air masses, with colder winters and very hot summers. In the southwest, climatic area of Metohija receives more mediterranean influences with warmer summers, somewhat higher precipitation () and heavy snowfalls in the winter. The mountainous areas of the Accursed Mountains in the west, Šar Mountains on the south and Kopaonik in the north experiences alpine climate, with high precipitation ( per year), short and fresh summers, and cold winters. The average annual temperature of Kosovo is . The warmest month is July with average temperature of , and the coldest is January with . Except Prizren and Istog, all other meteorological stations in January recorded average temperatures under .
=== Biodiversity ===

Located in Southeastern Europe, Kosovo receives floral and faunal species from Europe and Eurasia. Forests are widespread in Kosovo and cover at least 39% of the region. Phytogeographically, it straddles the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. In addition, it falls within three terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, and Pindus Mountains mixed forests. Kosovo&#x27;s biodiversity is conserved in two national parks, eleven nature reserves and one hundred three other protected areas. The Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park and Sharr Mountains National Park are the most important regions of vegetation and biodiversity in Kosovo. Kosovo had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.19/10, ranking it 107th globally out of 172 countries.

Flora encompasses more than 1,800 species of vascular plant species, but the actual number is estimated to be higher than 2,500 species. The diversity is the result of the complex interaction of geology and hydrology creating a wide variety of habitat conditions for flora growth. Although, Kosovo represents only 2.3% of the entire surface area of the Balkans, in terms of vegetation it has 25% of the Balkan flora and about 18% of the European flora. The fauna is composed of a wide range of species. The mountainous west and southeast provide a great habitat for several rare or endangered species including brown bears, lynxes, wild cats, wolves, foxes, wild goats, roebucks and deers. A total of 255 species of birds have been recorded, with raptors such as the golden eagle, eastern imperial eagle and lesser kestrel living principally in the mountains of Kosovo.

=== Environmental issues ===

Environmental issues in Kosovo include a wide range of challenges pertaining to air and water pollution, climate change, waste management, biodiversity loss and nature conservation. The vulnerability of the country to climate change is influenced by various factors, such as increased temperatures, geological and hydrological hazards, including droughts, flooding, fires and rains. Kosovo is not a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. Consequently, the country is not mandated to submit a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that are voluntary commitments outlining a nation&#x27;s actions and strategies for mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts. However, since 2021, Kosovo is actively engaged in the process of formulating a voluntary NDC, with assistance provided from Japan. In 2023, the country has established a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 16.3% as part of its broader objective to achieve carbon neutrality by the year 2050.
== Demographics ==

The Agency of Statistics estimated Kosovo&#x27;s population in 2021 to be approximately 1,774,000. In 2023, the overall life expectancy at birth is 79.68 years; 77.38 years for males and 81.87 years for females. The estimated total fertility rate in 2023 is 1.88 children born per woman. The country is the 11th most populous country in the Southeastern Europe (Balkans) and ranks as the 148th most populous country in the world. The country&#x27;s population rose steadily over the 20th century and peaked at an estimated 2.2 million in 1998. The Kosovo War and subsequent migration have decreased the population of Kosovo over time. 

In 2019, Albanians constituted 92% of the population of Kosovo, followed by ethnic Serbs (4%), Bosniaks (2%), Turks (1%), Romani (1%), and the Gorani (&lt;1%). Albanians constitute the majority of the population in most of Kosovo. Ethnic Serbs are concentrated in the north of the country, as well as in other municipalities in the east of the country, such as Gračanica and Štrpce. Turks form a local majority in the municipality of Mamusha, just north of Prizren, while the Bosniaks are mainly located within Prizren itself. The Gorani are concentrated in the southernmost tip of the country, in Dragash. The Romani are spread across the entire country.

The official languages of Kosovo are Albanian and Serbian and the institutions are committed to ensure the equal use of those two official languages of Kosovo. Municipal civil servants are only required to speak one of the two languages in a professional setting and, according to Language Commissioner of Kosovo Slaviša Mladenović, no government organisation has all of its documents available in both languages. The Law on the Use of Languages gives Turkish the status of an official language in the municipality of Prizren, irrespective of the size of the Turkish community living there. Otherwise, Turkish, Bosnian and Roma hold the status of official languages at municipal level if the linguistic community represents at least 5% of the total population of municipality. Albanian is spoken as a first language by all Albanians, as well as some of the Romani people, such as the Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians. Serbian, Bosnian, and Turkish are spoken as first languages by their respective communities.

According to the World Happiness Report 2024, which evaluates the happiness levels of citizens in various countries, Kosovo is currently ranked 29th among a total of 143 nations assessed, compared with neighbours Serbia ranked 37th, Montenegro 76th, North Macedonia 84th and Albania 87th.

The relations between Kosovar Albanians and Kosovar Serbs have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century. During Communism in Yugoslavia, the ethnic Albanians and Serbs were strongly irreconcilable, with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that ethnic Albanians and Serbs rarely accepted each other as neighbors or friends and few held inter-ethnic marriages. Ethnic prejudices, stereotypes and mutual distrust between ethnic Albanians and Serbs have remained common for decades. The level of intolerance and separation between both communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to be worse than that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia, which also had tensions but held some closer relations between each other.

Despite their planned integration into the Kosovar society and their recognition in the Kosovar constitution, the Romani, Ashkali, and Egyptian communities continue to face many difficulties, such as segregation and discrimination, in housing, education, health, employment and social welfare. Many camps around Kosovo continue to house thousands of internally displaced people, all of whom are from minority groups and communities. Because many of the Roma are believed to have sided with the Serbs during the conflict, taking part in the widespread looting and destruction of Albanian property, Minority Rights Group International report that Romani people encounter hostility by Albanians outside their local areas. A 2020 research report funded by the EU shows that there is a limited scale of trust and overall contact between the major ethnic groups in Kosovo.

=== Religion ===


Kosovo is a secular state with no state religion; freedom of belief, conscience and religion is explicitly guaranteed in the Constitution of Kosovo. Kosovar society is strongly secularised and is ranked first in Southern Europe and ninth in the world as free and equal for tolerance towards religion and atheism.

In the 2011 census, 95.6% of the population of Kosovo was counted as Muslim and 3.7% as Christian including 2.2% as Roman Catholic and 1.5% as Eastern Orthodox. The remaining 0.3% of the population reported having no religion, or another religion, or did not provide an adequate answer. Protestants, although recognised as a religious group in Kosovo by the government, were not represented in the census. The census was largely boycotted by the Kosovo Serbs, who predominantly identify as Serbian Orthodox Christians, especially in North Kosovo, leaving the Serb population underrepresented.

Islam is the most widely practiced religion in Kosovo and was introduced in the Middle Ages by the Ottomans. Today, Kosovo has the second-highest number of Muslims as a percentage of its population in Europe after Turkey. The majority of the Muslim population of Kosovo are ethnic Albanians, Turks, and Slavs such as Gorani and Bosniaks.

Members of the Roman Catholic Church are predominantly Albanians while ethnic Serbs mainly belong to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2008, Protestant pastor Artur Krasniqi, primate of the Kosovo Protestant Evangelical Church, claimed that &quot;as many as 15,000&quot; Kosovar Albanians had converted to Protestantism since 1985.

Relations between the Albanian Muslim and Albanian Catholic communities in Kosovo are good; however, both communities have few or no relations with the Serbian Orthodox community. In general, the Albanians define their ethnicity by language and not by religion, while religion reflects a distinguishing identity feature among the Slavs of Kosovo and elsewhere.
== Economy ==


The economy of Kosovo is a transitional economy. It suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees and the following Yugoslav Wars. Despite declining foreign assistance, the GDP has mostly grown since its declaration of independence. This was despite the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the subsequent European debt crisis. Additionally, the inflation rate has been low. Most economic development has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora, foreign direct investment, and other capital inflows.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the International Monetary Fund reported that approximately one-sixth of the population lived below the poverty line and one-third of the working age population was unemployed, the highest rate in Europe.

Kosovo&#x27;s largest trading partners are Albania, Italy, Switzerland, China, Germany and Turkey. The Euro is its official currency. The Government of Kosovo has signed free-trade agreements with Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia. Kosovo is a member of CEFTA, agreed with UNMIK, and enjoys free trade with most nearby non-European Union countries.

Kosovo is dominated by the services sector, accounting for 54% of GDP and employing approximately 56.6% of the population. The industry accounted for 37.3% of GDP and employs roughly 24.8% of the labour force. There are several reasons for the stagnation, ranging from consecutive occupations, political turmoil and the War in Kosovo in 1999. While agriculture accounts for only 6.6% of GDP, albeit an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 2019, it forms 18.7% of Kosovo&#x27;s workforce, the highest proportion of agricultural employment in the region after Albania.

Kosovo has large reserves of lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron and bauxite. The nation has the fifth-largest lignite reserves in the world and the third in Europe. The Directorate for Mines and Minerals and the World Bank estimated that Kosovo had €13.5 billion worth of minerals in 2005. The primary sector is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units. 53% of the nation&#x27;s area is agricultural land, 41% forest and forestry land, and 6% for others.

Wine has historically been produced in Kosovo. The main heartland of Kosovo&#x27;s wine industry is in Rahovec. The main cultivars include Pinot noir, Merlot, and Chardonnay. Kosovo exports wines to Germany and the United States. The four state-owned wine production facilities were not as much &quot;wineries&quot; as they were &quot;wine factories&quot;. Only the Rahovec facility that held approximately 36% of the total vineyard area had the capacity of around 50 million litres annually. The major share of the wine production was intended for exports. At its peak in 1989, the exports from the Rahovec facility amounted to 40 million litres and were mainly distributed to the German market.

=== Energy ===


The electricity sector in Kosovo is considered one of the sectors with the greatest potential of development. Kosovo&#x27;s electricity sector is highly dependent on coal-fired power plants, which use the abundant lignite, so efforts are being made to diversify electricity generation with more renewables sources, such as wind farms in Bajgora and Kitka.

A joint energy bloc between Kosovo and Albania, is in work after an agreement which was signed in December 2019. With that agreement Albania and Kosovo will now be able to exchange energy reserves, which is expected to result in €4 million in savings per year for Kosovo.

=== Tourism ===


The natural values of Kosovo represent quality tourism resources. The description of Kosovo&#x27;s potential in tourism is closely related to its geographical location, in the centre of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe. It represents a crossroads which historically dates back to antiquity. Kosovo serves as a link in the connection between Central and Southern Europe and the Adriatic Sea and Black Sea. Kosovo is generally rich in various topographical features, including high mountains, lakes, canyons, steep rock formations and rivers. The mountainous west and southeast of Kosovo has great potential for winter tourism. Skiing takes place at the Brezovica ski resort within the Šar Mountains, with the close proximity to the Pristina Airport (60 km) and Skopje International Airport (70 km) which is a popular destination for international tourists.

Kosovo also has lakes like Lake Batllava that serves as a popular destination for watersports, camping, and swimming. Other lakes include Ujmani Lake, Liqenati Lake, Zemra Lake.

Other major attractions include the capital, Pristina, the historical cities of Prizren, Peja and Gjakova but also Ferizaj and Gjilan.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; included Kosovo on the list of 41 places to visit in 2011.

=== Transport ===

Road transportation of passengers and freight is the most common form of transportation in Kosovo. There are two main motorways in Kosovo: the R7 connecting Kosovo with Albania and the R6 connecting Pristina to the Macedonian border at Hani i Elezit. The construction of the R7.1 Motorway began in 2017.

The R7 Motorway (part of Albania-Kosovo Highway) links Kosovo to Albania&#x27;s Adriatic coast in Durrës. Once the remaining European route (E80) from Pristina to Merdare section project will be completed, the motorway will link Kosovo through the present European route (E80) highway with the Pan-European corridor X (E75) near Niš in Serbia. The R6 Motorway, forming part of the E65, is the second motorway constructed in the region. It links the capital Pristina with the border with North Macedonia at Hani i Elezit, which is about from Skopje. Construction of the motorway started in 2014 and finished in 2019.

Trainkos operates daily passenger trains on two routes: Pristina – Fushë Kosovë – Pejë, as well as Pristina – Fushë Kosovë – Ferizaj – Skopje, North Macedonia (the latter in cooperation with Macedonian Railways). Also, freight trains run throughout the country.

The nation hosts two airports, Pristina International Airport and Gjakova Airport. Pristina International Airport is located southwest of Pristina. It is Kosovo&#x27;s only international airport and the only port of entry for air travelers to Kosovo. Gjakova Airport was built by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) following the Kosovo War, next to an existing airfield used for agricultural purposes, and was used mainly for military and humanitarian flights. The local and national government plans to offer Gjakova Airport for operation under a public-private partnership with the aim of turning it into a civilian and commercial airport.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Health ===
In the past, Kosovo&#x27;s capabilities to develop a modern health care system were limited. Low GDP during 1990 worsened the situation even more. However, the establishment of Faculty of Medicine in the University of Pristina marked a significant development in health care. This was also followed by launching different health clinics which enabled better conditions for professional development.

Nowadays the situation has changed, and the health care system in Kosovo is organised into three sectors: primary, secondary and tertiary health care. Primary health care in Pristina is organised into thirteen family medicine centres and fifteen ambulatory care units. Secondary health care is decentralised in seven regional hospitals. Pristina does not have any regional hospital and instead uses University Clinical Centre of Kosovo for health care services. University Clinical Centre of Kosovo provides its health care services in twelve clinics, where 642 doctors are employed. At a lower level, home services are provided for several vulnerable groups which are not able to reach health care premises. Kosovo health care services are now focused on patient safety, quality control and assisted health. 
=== Education ===


Education for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is predominantly public and supported by the state, run by the Ministry of Education. Education takes place in two main stages: primary and secondary education, and higher education.

The primary and secondary education is subdivided into four stages: preschool education, primary and low secondary education, high secondary education and special education. Preschool education is for children from the ages of one to five. Primary and secondary education is obligatory for everyone. It is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools and also available in languages of recognised minorities in Kosovo, where classes are held in Albanian, Serbian, Bosnian, Turkish and Croatian. The first phase (primary education) includes grades one to five, and the second phase (low secondary education) grades six to nine. The third phase (high secondary education) consists of general education but also professional education, which is focused on different fields. It lasts four years. However, pupils are offered possibilities of applying for higher or university studies. According to the Ministry of Education, children who are not able to get a general education are able to get a special education (fifth phase).
Higher education can be received in universities and other higher-education institutes. These educational institutions offer studies for Bachelor, Master and PhD degrees. The students may choose full-time or part-time studies.

Students from Kosovo performed very poorly on several PISA tests, and this result has sparked debates about the education system.

=== Media ===
Kosovo ranks 56th out of 180 countries in the 2023 Press Freedom Index report compiled by the Reporters Without Borders. The Media consists of different kinds of communicative media such as radio, television, newspapers, and internet web sites. Most of the media survive from advertising and subscriptions. As according to IREX there are 92 radio stations and 22 television stations.

== Culture ==
=== Cuisine ===


Kosovar cuisine is distinguished by multifaceted culinary influences derived from Balkan, Mediterranean, and Ottoman traditions. This combination reflects Kosovo&#x27;s diverse historical and cultural contexts while highlighting its Albanian heritage. A paramount aspect of this tradition is the principle of hospitality, as articulated in the Kanun, which guides various aspects of social interactions and practices. Particularly, the notion &quot;the house of an Albanian belongs to God and to the guest&quot; underscores the high regard on treating guests with respect and generosity. Fli stands out for its unique preparation, which involves layering batter and cream in a special pan called a saç, baked slowly over several hours. Pite, a savory pie filled with a mixture of meat, cheese, or spinach, is often enjoyed as a hearty meal throughout Kosovo. Another popular dish is Byrek, a flaky pastry that can be filled with a variety of ingredients, including meat, spinach, or cheese, and is often prepared in circular pans. Qebapa are hand-rolled sausages, traditionally made from a blend of minced beef and other meats, are seasoned with a mix of spices such as garlic and black pepper. They are commonly served alongside freshly baked bread, raw onions and ajvar, a popular savory red pepper, eggplant and garlic spread that complements the dish. Petulla, or fried dough balls also known as Llokuma, are often drizzled with honey or sprinkled with sugar. Reçel, a type of fruit preserve, is made from various fruits and often used as a spread on bread or served alongside petulla.

Bakllavë is a traditional dessert in Southern Europe, comprising layers of phyllo pastry filled with nuts and drizzled with honey that is often served for festive occasions. Another notable dessert is Trileçe, a sponge cake soaked in a blend of three types of milk and covered with caramel. The coffee culture of Kosovo represents a vibrant and essential aspect of daily life, functioning as a cornerstone for social interactions and communal gatherings. In Kosovo, coffee symbolises hospitality and community, inviting both locals and visitors to connect. Often accompanied by traditional sweets and pastries, the preparation of coffee typically involves a cezve, a traditional pot for brewing finely ground coffee. This method emphasises the ceremonial nature of coffee preparation. Hosts take pride in serving their guests the finest brew, highlighting the importance of hospitality. The act of sharing coffee fosters meaningful conversations among individuals, with people recounting stories and engaging in discussions about life.
=== Sports ===

Since its declaration of independence in 2008, Kosovo has made substantial advancements in international sports. The nation&#x27;s inaugural participation in the Olympic Games occurred at the 2016 games, where it achieved a milestone by securing its first medals, totaling five medals to date. Kosovo&#x27;s involvement in the European Games began in 2015, during which the nation amassed four medals. Additionally, Kosovo commenced participation in the Mediterranean Games in 2018, achieving success with a total of ten medals. Forthcoming, Kosovo is scheduled to host the 2030 games, marking a significant opportunity for the nation in the realm of international sports. Notable athletes such as Laura Fazliu, Akil Gjakova, Nora Gjakova, Majlinda Kelmendi, Loriana Kuka, and Distria Krasniqi have played vital roles in Kosovo&#x27;s sporting achievements, with Majlinda Kelmendi being particularly recognised for winning the nation&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal. Judo has become a cornerstone of Kosovo&#x27;s success in international competitions, accounting for the majority of the nation&#x27;s medals across various events. Prior to Kosovo&#x27;s independence, notable athletes such as Aziz Salihu, Vladimir Durković, Fahrudin Jusufi, and Milutin Šoškić represented Yugoslavia, thereby contributing to the diverse athletic heritage of Kosovo.

Kosovo achieved full membership status in both the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 2016, facilitating the nation&#x27;s participation in international football competitions. As a result, the national football team of Kosovo became eligible to compete in qualification rounds for major tournaments such as the UEFA Nations League, the European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. The team&#x27;s paramount achievement occurred during the 2018–19 edition of the UEFA Nations League, wherein they concluded the tournament atop their League D group, maintaining an unbeaten record of four victories and two draws, thus securing promotion to a higher competitive tier. Several Kosovo-Albanian players have opted to represent various European nations, highlighting figures examples, including Lorik Cana for Albania and Adnan Januzaj for Belgium. Furthermore, key contributions have come from players such as Valon Behrami, Xherdan Shaqiri, and Granit Xhaka, all of whom have made pivotal contributions to the Swiss team.
=== Arts ===


The architecture of Kosovo dates back to the Neolithic, Bronze and Middle Ages. It has been influenced by the presence of different civilisations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day.

Kosovo is home to many monasteries and churches from the 13th and 14th centuries that represent the Serbian Orthodox legacy. Architectural heritage from the Ottoman Period includes mosques and hamams from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Other historical architectural structures of interest include kullas from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as a number of bridges, urban centres and fortresses. While some vernacular buildings are not considered important in their own right, taken together they are of considerable interest. During the 1999 conflict in Kosovo, many buildings that represent this heritage were destroyed or damaged. In the Dukagjini region, at least 500 kullas were attacked, and most of them destroyed or otherwise damaged.

In 2004, UNESCO recognised the Visoki Dečani monastery as World Heritage Site for its outstanding universal value. Two years later, the site of patrimony was extended as a serial nomination, to include three other religious monuments: Patriarchate of Peja, Our Lady of Ljeviš and Gračanica monastery under the name of Medieval Monuments in Kosovo. It consists of four Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries, which represent the fusion of the eastern Orthodox Byzantine and the western Romanesque ecclesiastical architecture to form the Palaiologan Renaissance style.

These monuments have come under attack, especially during the 2004 ethnic violence. In 2006, the property was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to difficulties in its management and conservation stemming from the region&#x27;s political instability.

Kosovar art was unknown to the international public for a very long time, because of the regime, many artists were unable to display their art in art galleries, and so were always on the lookout for alternatives, and even resorted to taking matters into their own hands. Until 1990, artists from Kosovo presented their art in many prestigious worldwide renowned centres. They were affirmed and evaluated highly because of their unique approach to the arts considering the circumstances in which they were created, making them distinguished and original.

In February 1979, the Kosova National Art Gallery was founded. It became the highest institution of visual arts in Kosovo. It was named after one of the most prominent artists of Kosovo Muslim Mulliqi. Engjëll Berisha, Masar Caka, Tahir Emra, Abdullah Gërguri, Hysni Krasniqi, Nimon Lokaj, Aziz Nimani, Ramadan Ramadani, Esat Valla and Lendita Zeqiraj are some of few Albanian painters born in Kosovo.

=== Music ===
Although the music in Kosovo is diverse, authentic Albanian and Serbian music still exist. Albanian music is characterised by the use of the Çifteli. Classical music is well known in Kosovo and has been taught at several music schools and universities. In 2014, Kosovo submitted their first film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, with &quot;Three Windows and a Hanging&quot; directed by Isa Qosja.

A baked-clay ocarina was found in the village of Runik which is considered to be the oldest musical instrument found in Kosovo and one of the oldest ocarinas ever found in Europe. Runik ocarina is thought to be at least 8,000 years old.

In the past, epic poetry in Kosovo and Northern Albania was sung on a lahuta and then a more tuneful çiftelia was used which has two strings-one for the melody and one for drone. Kosovar music is influenced by Turkish music due to the almost 500-year span of Ottoman rule in Kosovo though Kosovar folklore has preserved its originality and exemplary. Archaeological research tells how old this tradition is and how it was developed in parallel with other traditional music in the Balkans. Roots dating to the 5th century BC have been found in paintings on stones of singers with instruments. (There is a famous portrait of &quot;Pani&quot; holding an instrument similar to a flute).

The contemporary music artists Rita Ora, Dua Lipa and Era Istrefi, are all of Albanian origin and have achieved international recognition for their music. One widely recognised musician from Prizren is guitarist Petrit Çeku, winner of several international prizes.

Serbian music from Kosovo presents a mixture of traditional music, which is part of the wider Balkan tradition, with its own distinctive sound, and various Western and Turkish influences. Serb songs from Kosovo were an inspiration for 12th song wreath by composer Stevan Mokranjac. Most of Serbian music from Kosovo was dominated by church music, with its own share of sung epic poetry. Serbian national instrument Gusle is also used in Kosovo.

Viktorija is the only artist from Kosovo who represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest as part of Aska in 1982. Singer Rona Nishliu finished 5th in the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, while Lindita represented Albania in 2017. Several Serbian singers from Kosovo have also participated in the Serbian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. Nevena Božović represented Serbia in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest and twice in the Eurovision Song Contest, firstly as a member of Moje 3 in 2013 and as a solo act in 2019.

=== Cinema ===

The film industry of Kosovo dates from the 1970s. In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established Kosovafilm, a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after Yugoslav withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.

The International Documentary and Short Film Festival is the largest film event in Kosovo. The Festival is organised in August in Prizren, which attracts numerous international and regional artists. In this annually organised festival, films are screened twice a day in three open-air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas. Except for its films, the festival is also well known for lively nights after the screening. Various events happen within the scope of the festival: workshops, DokuPhoto exhibitions, festival camping, concerts, which altogether turn the city into a charming place to be. In 2010, Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.

International actors of Albanian origin from Kosovo include Arta Dobroshi, James Biberi, Faruk Begolli and Bekim Fehmiu. The Prishtina International Film Festival is the largest film festival, held annually in Pristina, in Kosovo that screens prominent international cinema productions in the Balkan region and beyond, and draws attention to the Kosovar film industry.

The movie &quot;Shok&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film at the 88th Academy Awards. The movie was written and directed by Oscar nominated director Jamie Donoughue, based on true events during the Kosovo war. &quot;Shok&quot;&#x27;s distributor is Ouat Media, and the social media campaign is led by Team Albanians.

<doc id="17392" wikidata="Q178565" url="?curid=17392" title="Konqueror">
<text>Konqueror is a free and open-source web browser and file manager that provides web access and file-viewer functionality for file systems (such as local files, files on a remote FTP server and files in a disk image). It forms a core part of the KDE Software Compilation. Developed by volunteers, Konqueror can run on most Unix-like operating systems. The KDE community licenses and distributes Konqueror under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later.

The name &quot;Konqueror&quot; references the two primary competitors at the time of the browser&#x27;s first release: &quot;first comes the Navigator, then Explorer, and then the Konqueror&quot;.
It also follows the KDE naming convention: the names of most KDE programs begin with the letter K.

Konqueror first appeared with version 2 of KDE on October 23, 2000. It replaced its predecessor, KFM (KDE file manager). With the release of KDE 4 in 2008, the functionalities of web browser and file manager were separated: Dolphin replaced Konqueror as the default KDE file manager, while the KDE community continues to maintain Konqueror as the default KDE web browser.

==Major supported protocols==
Konqueror can utilize all KIOslaves installed on the user&#x27;s system. Some examples include: 
* FTP and SFTP/SSH browser
* Samba (Microsoft file-sharing) browser
* HTTP browser
* IMAP mail client
* ISO (CD image) viewer
* VNC viewer

A complete list is available in the KDE Info Center&#x27;s Protocols section.

==User interface==
Konqueror supports tabbed document interface and Split views, wherein a window can contain multiple documents in tabs. Multiple document interfaces are not supported, however it is possible to recursively divide a window to view multiple documents simultaneously, or simply open another window.

Konqueror&#x27;s user interface is somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer, though it is more customizable. It works extensively with &quot;panels&quot;, which can be rearranged or added. For example, one could have an Internet bookmarks panel on the left side of the browser window, and by clicking a bookmark, the respective web page would be viewed in the larger panel to the right. Alternatively, one could display a hierarchical list of folders in one panel and the content of the selected folder in another. Panels are quite flexible and can even include, among other KParts (components), a console window, a text editor, and a media player. Panel configurations can be saved, and there are some default configurations. (For example, &quot;Midnight Commander&quot; displays a screen split into two panels, where each one contains a folder, Web site, or file view.)

Navigation functions (back, forward, history, etc.) are available during all operations. Most keyboard shortcuts can be remapped using a graphical configuration, and navigation can be conducted through an assignment of letters to nodes on the active file by pressing the control key. The address bar has extensive autocompletion support for local directories, past URLs, and past search terms.

==Web browser==

Konqueror has been developed as an autonomous web browser project. It uses KHTML as its browser engine, which is compliant with HTML and supports JavaScript, CSS, SSL, and other relevant open standards. An alternative layout engine, &quot;kwebkitpart&quot;, is available from the Extragear.

While KHTML is the default web-rendering engine, Konqueror is a modular application and other rendering engines are available. In particular, the WebKitPart component using the KHTML-derived WebKit engine has seen a lot of support in the KDE 4 series. However, the KHTML rendering backend contains unique features, such as the ability to save a full archive of any given webpage into a single file with the &quot;.war&quot; extension.

Konqueror integrates several customizable search services which can be accessed by entering the service&#x27;s abbreviation code (for example, codice_1 for Google, or codice_2 for Wikipedia) followed by the search term(s). One can add their own search service; for instance, to retrieve English Wikipedia articles, a shortcut may be added with the URL codice_3.

KHTML&#x27;s rendering speed is on par with that of competing browsers, but sites with customized JavaScript are often problematic due to KHTML&#x27;s much smaller mind- and market-share, resulting in fewer JavaScript features built into the JS engine.

KJS is Konqueror&#x27;s JavaScript engine that was originally developed by Harri Porten in 2000. On June 13, 2002, Maciej Stachowiak announced on a mailing list that Apple was releasing JavaScriptCore, a framework for Mac OS X that was based on KJS.

Kubuntu&#x27;s 10.10 Maverick Meerkat release switched the default browser from Konqueror to rekonq, as well as a Firefox installer being added. Kubuntu subsequently switched from rekonq to Firefox, with the release of 14.04 Trusty Tahr.

==File manager==
Konqueror also allows browsing the local directory hierarchy—either by entering locations in the address bar, or by selecting items in the file browser window. It allows browsing in different views, which differ in their usage of icons and layout. Files can also be executed, viewed, copied, moved, and deleted.

The user can also open an embedded version of Konsole, via KDE&#x27;s KParts technology, in which they can directly execute shell commands. In addition to the Konsole KPart, Konqueror can also use a Filelight KPart, to view a radial diagram of the user&#x27;s filesystem.

Although this functionality has not been removed from Konqueror, as of KDE 4, Dolphin has replaced Konqueror as the default file manager. Dolphin can – like Konqueror – divide each window or tab into multiple panes. Konqueror makes more powerful use of this feature, allowing as many vertically and horizontally divided panes as desired. Each can link to different content or even remote locations, so that Konqueror becomes a powerful graphical tool to manage content on multiple servers all in one window, &quot;dragging and dropping&quot; files between locations.

==File viewer==
Using the KParts object model, Konqueror executes components that are capable of viewing (and sometimes editing) specific filetypes and embeds their client area directly into the Konqueror panel in which the respective files have been opened. This makes it possible to, for example, view an OpenDocument (via Calligra) or PDF document directly within Konqueror. Any application that implements the KParts model correctly can be embedded in this fashion.

KParts can also be used to embed certain types of multimedia content into HTML pages; for example, the KMPlayer KPart enables Konqueror to show embedded video on web pages.

==KIO==

In addition to browsing files and websites, Konqueror utilizes KIO plugins to extend its capabilities well beyond those of other browsers and file managers. It uses components of KIO, the KDE I/O plugin system, to access different protocols such as HTTP and FTP (support for these is built-in), WebDAV, SMB (Windows shares), SFTP and FISH (a handy replacement to the latter when the SFTP subsystem is disabled on the remote host).

Similarly, Konqueror can use KIO plugins (called IOslaves) to access ZIP files and other archives, to process ed2k links (edonkey/emule), or even to browse audio CDs, (&quot;audiocd:/&quot;) and rip them via drag-and-drop. Likewise, the &quot;man:&quot; and &quot;info:&quot; IOslaves can be used to fetch man and info formatted documentation.

==Konqueror Embedded==
An embedded systems version, Konqueror Embedded was previously available. Unlike the full version of Konqueror, Embedded Konqueror is purely a web browser. It does not require KDE or even the X window system. A single static library, it is designed to be as small as possible, while providing all necessary functions of a web browser, such as support for HTML 4, CSS, JavaScript, cookies, and SSL. 

As of June 2019, this project&#x27;s page on the KDE website has been taken down.

==Download manager==

KGet is a free download manager for KDE and is the default download manager for Konqueror. It is part of the KDE Network package. By default, it is the download manager used for Konqueror, but can also be used with Mozilla Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers as well as rekonq. KGet was featured by &quot;Tux Magazine&quot; and &quot;Free Software Magazine&quot;.

===History===
On KDE 3, KGet 0.8.x, 1 supported HTTP/FTP download.
On KDE Software Compilation 4, KGet 2 was released; it supported bandwidth throttling segmentation, multi-threading, and the BitTorrent protocol.

===Features===
*Downloading files from FTP, HTTP(S) and BitTorrent sources.
*Pausing and resuming of downloading files, as well as the ability to restart a download.
*Gives of information about current and pending downloads.
*Embedding into system tray of the host system.
*Integration with the KDE Konqueror and Rekonq web browsers.
*Metalink support which contain multiple URLs for downloads, along with checksums and other information.
*Automatically tags downloaded files with download information (such as the download URL) using Nepomuk.
*Download from multiple servers to speed up download time (segmented file transfer).

<text>In Western musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp (), flat (), or rarely, natural () symbols placed on the staff at the beginning of a section of music. The initial key signature in a piece is placed immediately after the clef at the beginning of the first line. If the piece contains a section in a different key, the new key signature is placed at the beginning of that section.

In a key signature, a sharp or flat symbol on a line or space of the staff indicates that the note represented by that line or space is to be played a semitone higher (sharp) or lower (flat) than it would otherwise be played. This applies through the rest of the piece or until another key signature appears. Each symbol applies to comparable notes in all octaves—for example, a flat on the fourth space of the treble staff (as in the diagram) indicates that all notes notated as Es are played as E-flats, including those on the bottom line of the staff.

Most of this article addresses key signatures that represent the diatonic keys of Western music. These contain either flats or sharps, but not both, and the different key signatures add flats or sharps according to the order shown in the circle of fifths.

Each major and minor key has an associated key signature, showing up to seven flats or seven sharps, that indicates the notes used in its scale. Music was sometimes notated with a key signature that did not match its key in this way—this can be seen in some Baroque pieces, or transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes.

== Overview ==

With any note as a starting point, a certain series of intervals produces a major scale: whole step, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.

Starting on C, this yields C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C (a C-major scale). There are no sharps or flats in this scale, so the key signature for C has no sharps or flats in it. Starting on any other note requires that at least one of these notes be changed (raised or lowered) to preserve the major scale pattern. These raised or lowered notes form the key signature. Starting the pattern on D, for example, yields D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D, so the key signature for D major has two sharps—F and C.

Key signatures indicate that this applies to the section of music that follows, showing the reader which key the music is in, and making it unnecessary to apply accidentals to individual notes.

In standard music notation, the order in which sharps or flats appear in key signatures is uniform, following the circle of fifths: F, C, G, D, A, E, B, and B, E, A, D, G, C, F. Musicians can identify the key by the number of sharps or flats shown, since they always appear in the same order. A key signature with one sharp must show F-sharp, which indicates G major or E minor.

There can be exceptions to this, especially in 20th-century music, if a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale and an invented key signature to reflect that. This may consist of sharps or flats that are not in the usual order, or of sharps combined with flats (e.g., F and B). Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of Béla Bartók, for example.

In a score, transposing instruments will show a different key signature to reflect their transposition but their music is in the same concert key as the other instruments. Percussion instruments with indeterminate pitch will not show a key signature, and timpani parts are sometimes written without a key signature (early timpani parts were sometimes notated with the high drum as &quot;C&quot; and the low drum a fourth lower as &quot;G&quot;, with actual pitches indicated at the beginning of the music, e.g., &quot;timpani in D–A&quot;). In polytonal music, where different parts are actually in different keys sounding together, instruments may be notated in different keys.

== Conventions ==
The order in which sharps or flats appear in key signatures is illustrated in the diagram of the circle of fifths. Starting the major scale pattern (whole step, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half) on C requires no sharps or flats. Proceeding clockwise in the diagram starts the scale a fifth higher, on G. Starting on G requires one sharp, F, to form a major scale. Starting another fifth higher, on D, requires F and C. This pattern continues, raising the seventh scale degree of each successive key. As the scales become notated in flats, this is shown by eliminating one of the flats. This is strictly a function of notation—the seventh scale degree is still being raised by a semitone compared to the previous key in the sequence. Going counter-clockwise from C results in lowering the fourth scale degree with each successive key (starting on F requires a B to form a major scale). Each major key has a relative minor key that shares the same key signature. The relative minor is always a minor third lower than its relative major.

The key signatures with seven flats and seven sharps are usually notated in their enharmonic equivalents. C major (seven sharps) is usually written as D major (five flats) and C major is usually written as B major.

The key signature may be changed at any time in a piece by providing a new signature. If the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is used to cancel the preceding signature. If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.

=== Variations ===
Traditionally, when the key signature changes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted. Many more recent publications (newer music or newer editions of older music) dispense with the naturals (unless the new key signature is C major) and simply insert the new signature.

Similarly, when a flat key changes to fewer flats, or a sharp key changes to fewer sharps, the convention was to use naturals to cancel the flats or sharps that are being subtracted before the new signature is written. Again, more modern usage often simply shows the new signature without these naturals.

When a flat key changes to more flats or a sharp key changes to more sharps, the new signature is simply written in without using naturals to cancel the old signature. This convention applies in both traditional and newer styles.

At one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a double barline even if it was not otherwise required, but it has become increasingly common to simply retain a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline and the line at the very end of the staff is omitted.

If both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also modern variations about where a barline will be placed. In some scores by Debussy the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been usual to place all the symbols after the barline.

The A which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;, in the third section, &quot;Pines of the Janiculum&quot; (which is in B major), in the bass-clef instrumental parts.

In the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear on the space below the staff. An example of this can be seen in Isaac Albéniz&#x27;s &quot;Iberia&quot;: first movement, &quot;Evocación&quot;, which is in A minor.

=== Double flats and sharps ===
Key signatures can theoretically be extended through double flats or double sharps and beyond, but this is extremely rare. For example, the key of G major would have eight sharps, requiring six single sharps and an F double-sharp (F). The key of A major, with four flats, is enharmonically equivalent and would generally be used instead.

A piece in a major key might modulate up a fifth to the dominant (a common occurrence in Western music), resulting in a new key signature with an additional sharp. If the original key was C-sharp, such a modulation would lead to the theoretical key of G-sharp major (with eight sharps) requiring an F in place of the F. This section could be written using the enharmonically equivalent key signature of A-flat major instead. Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Suite bergamasque&quot; does this: in the third movement &quot;Clair de lune&quot; the key shifts from D-flat major to D-flat minor (eight flats) for a few measures but the passage is notated in C-sharp minor (four sharps); the same happens in the final movement, &quot;Passepied&quot;, in which a G-sharp major section is written as A-flat major.

Such passages may instead be notated with the use of double-sharp or double-flat accidentals, as in this example from Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, which has this passage in G-sharp major in measures 10-12.

While the theoretical keys are sometimes notated with accidentals as in this example, the use of actual theoretical key signatures is very rare. The final pages of John Foulds&#x27; &quot;A World Requiem&quot; are written in G♯ major (with F in the key signature), No. 18 of Anton Reicha&#x27;s &quot;Practische Beispiele&quot; is written in B# major, and the third movement of Victor Ewald&#x27;s Brass Quintet Op. 8 is written in F♭ major (with B in the key signature).

Examples of theoretical key signatures are pictured below:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \omit Staff.TimeSignature \omit Staff.KeyCancellation
 \key gis \major &lt;gis&#x27; bis dis&gt;&lt;eis gis bis&gt;_\markup \halign #0.2 \center-column { &quot;G♯ maj&quot; &quot;E♯ min&quot; } \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \key dis \major &lt;dis fisis ais&gt;&lt;bis dis fisis&gt;_\markup \halign #0.2 \center-column { &quot;D♯ maj&quot; &quot;B♯ min&quot; } \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \key fes \major &lt;fes&#x27; as ces&gt;&lt;des fes as&gt;_\markup \halign #0.2 \center-column { &quot;F♭ maj&quot; &quot;D♭ min&quot; } \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \key beses \major &lt;beses&#x27; des fes&gt;&lt;ges beses des&gt;_\markup \halign #0.2 \center-column { &quot;B♭♭ maj&quot; &quot;G♭ min&quot; }
&lt;/score&gt;There does not appear to be a standard on how to notate these key signatures:

* The default behaviour of LilyPond (pictured above) writes all single sharps or flats in the circle-of-fifths order before showing the double signs. This is the format used in John Foulds&#x27; &quot;A World Requiem&quot;, Op. 60, which uses the key signature of G♯ major as displayed above. The sharps in the key signature of G♯ major proceed C♯, G♯, D♯, A♯, E♯, B♯, F.
* The single signs at the beginning are sometimes repeated as a courtesy, e.g. Max Reger&#x27;s &quot;Supplement to the Theory of Modulation&quot;, which contains D♭ minor key signatures on pp. 42–45. These have a B♭ at the start and also a B at the end (with a double-flat symbol), going B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭, F♭, B.
* Sometimes the double signs are written at the beginning of the key signature, followed by the single signs. For example, F♭ would be notated as B, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭, F♭. This convention is used by Victor Ewald and by some theoretical works.
* No. 18 of Anton Reicha&#x27;s &quot;Practische Beispiele&quot; in B♯ major shows B♯, E♯, A, D, G, C, F.

In tuning systems where the number of notes per octave is not a multiple of 12, notes such as G and A are not enharmonically equivalent, nor are the corresponding key signatures. These tunings can produce keys with no analogue in 12-tone equal temperament, which can require double sharps, double flats, or microtonal alterations in key signatures. For example, the key of G♯ major, with eight sharps, is equivalent to A major in 12-tone equal temperament, but in 19-tone equal temperament, it is equivalent to A major instead, with 11 flats.

==Major scale structure==
===Scales with sharp key signatures===
There can be up to seven sharps in a key signature, appearing in this order: . The key note or tonic of a piece in a major key is a semitone above the last sharp in the signature. For example, the key of D major has a key signature of F and C, and the tonic (D) is a semitone above C. Each scale starting on the fifth scale degree of the previous scale has one new sharp, added in the order shown.

===Scales with flat key signatures===
There can be up to seven flats in a key signature, applied as: The major scale with one flat is F major. In all major scales with flat key signatures, the tonic in a major key is a perfect fourth below the last flat. When there is more than one flat, the tonic is the note of the second-to-last flat in the signature. In the major key with four flats (B E A D), for example, the second to last flat is A, indicating a key of A major. Each new scale starts a fifth &quot;below&quot; (or a fourth above) the previous one.

== Relationship between key and signature ==
The sharps or flats needed to produce a diatonic scale in diatonic or tonal music can be shown as a key signature at the beginning of a section of music instead of showing accidentals on individual notes. While the key of a piece generally corresponds to the notated key signature, it may not in some cases, such as in pre-Baroque music, which was composed before the modern concept of keys had fully emerged.

Some pieces feature modulations, or changes in key, between contrasting sections. Modulations may or may not be reflected by a corresponding change in key signature. Modulated passages may instead make use of accidentals.

The Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538 by Bach has a key signature with no sharps or flats, indicating that it may be in D, in Dorian mode, but the Bs indicated with accidentals make the music in D minor.

===Additional terminology===
Keys which are associated with the same key signature are called relative keys.

When musical modes, such as Lydian or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called &quot;transposed modes&quot;.

== Use in other traditions ==

Key signatures are also used in music that does not come from the Western common practice period. This includes folk music, non-Western music, and Western music from before or after the common practice period.

Klezmer music uses scales other than diatonic major or minor, such as Phrygian dominant scale. Because of the limitations of the Great Highland Bagpipe scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, F and C. (The pipes are incapable of playing F and C so the sharps are not notated.) 20th century composers such as Bartók and Rzewski (see below) experimented with non-diatonic key signatures.

=== Historical notation ===
In music from the Baroque period, it is common to see key signatures in which the notes are annotated in a different order from the modern practice, or with the same note-letter annotated for each octave.

=== Unusual signatures ===
The 15 key signatures that form diatonic scales are sometimes called &quot;standard key signatures&quot;. Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidentals as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E (right hand), and F and G (left hand) used for the С diminished (С octatonic) scale in Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Crossed Hands&quot; (no. 99, vol. 4, &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot;); the B, E and F used for the D Phrygian dominant scale in Frederic Rzewski&#x27;s &quot;God to a Hungry Child&quot;; and the E and D (right hand) and the B, A, G (left hand) in György Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;Galamb Borong&quot; (no. 7 from the second book of the &quot;Études pour piano&quot;), and B, E, D,G (both hands) in &quot;Pour Irina&quot; (no. 16 from the same work&#x27;s third book).

There are also examples of conflicting standard signatures, as in:
* no. 3 of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Sarcasms&quot;, op. 17 (three sharps in the right hand, and five flats in the left hand)
* and four numbers of Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;Études pour piano&quot;:
** no. 1 from the first book (none in the right hand, and five sharps in the left hand)
** no. 10 from the second book (&quot;Der Zauberlehrling&quot;; none in the right hand, and five flats in the left hand in bars 67–87)
** no. 11 from the second book (&quot;En Suspens&quot;; five flats in the right hand and none in the left hand, with the opposite later on)
** no. 12 from the second book (&quot;Entrelacs&quot;; none in the right hand and five flats in the left hand, with the opposite later on)

No sharps or flats in a key signature can indicate that the music is in the key of C major / A minor, or that the piece is modal or atonal (does not have a key signature). An example is Bartók&#x27;s Piano Sonata, which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.

== History ==
The use of a one-flat signature developed in the Medieval period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century.

When signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a partial signature or conflicting signature. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century. The 16th-century motet &quot;Absolon fili mi&quot; by Pierre de La Rue (formerly attributed to Josquin des Prez) features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.

Baroque music written in minor keys often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats (because the A would frequently have to be sharpened to A in the ascending melodic minor scale, as would the B).

<doc id="17395" wikidata="Q1794677" url="?curid=17395" title="Kutia">
<text>Kutia or kutya (; ; ) is a ceremonial grain dish with sweet gravy traditionally served mostly by Eastern Orthodox Christians and some Catholic Christians predominantly in Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, but also in parts of Lithuania and Poland during the Christmas – Feast of Jordan holiday season or as part of a funeral feast. The word with a descriptor is also used to describe the eves of Christmas, New Year, and Feast of Jordan days.

==Etymology==
The word kutia is a borrowing from the Greek language (bean) or (grain).

== In Ukraine ==
In Ukraine kutіa is one of the two essential ritual dishes at the Ukrainian Christmas Eve supper (also known as &quot;Svyata vecherya&quot;). The ritual significance of kutia, as well as uzvar, is quite ancient. Ukrainian ethnographer Fedir Vovk traces the origins of these dishes to the Neolithic era. Before dinner, the kutia is placed in the icon corner (&quot;kut&quot;) , the most honorable place in the house where religious icons or images are placed. The pot with the kutia was to stand there in a designated spot from Rizdvo (Christmas on December 25) to January 1, New Year&#x27;s Day (formerly January 6 to the Old New Year in January 14). There is also a custom of sending children with kutia to relatives, usually grandparents and godparents. After dinner, the kutia is left on the table for the whole night with spoons for the dead ancestors, &quot;so that our relatives would have dinner and not be angry with us.&quot; The religious nature of the dish is emphasized by an ancient custom, when the head of the family approached the window or went out into the yard with a spoonful of kutia and, addressing the frost, invited him three times to take part in dinner with the family. When the frost does not appear, he is advised not to appear, not to do harm to crops, etc.: &quot;Frost, frost, come to us to eat kutia, and if you don&#x27;t come, don&#x27;t come for the rye, wheat and other crops.&quot;

Kutia is the first out of twelve dishes served for Svyata vecherya to be tasted. The head of the family takes the first spoon of the kutia, raises it up and calls out to the souls of departed family members to join them on this night. He then tastes the kutia, and throws the rest of the spoonful up to the ceiling. In rural towns, as many kernels of grain as stick to the ceiling, there should be swarms of bees and newborn cattle in the coming year. In the same vein, if there are many poppy seeds that remain on the ceiling, there would be a chance for more hen should lay as many eggs in the coming year than usual. In cities the same would imply a prosperous new year for the family and also a show of remembrance for their rural roots. Everyone present eats a spoonful of kutia, after which the other dishes are brought out and eaten.

The main ingredients used to make traditional kutia are wheatberries, poppy seeds and honey. At times, walnuts, dried fruit and raisins are added as well. Kutia is a Lenten dish and no milk or egg products can be used in this – since December 24 is a paramony – strict fasting and abstinence – day in the Eastern Orthodox Church and in Byzantine Rite Catholics. There are known kutia recipes that use pearl barley or millet instead of wheatberries.

Kolyvo is a Ukrainian ritual dish similar to kutia, but includes no poppy seeds. Kolyvo is served at remembrance services.

== In Poland ==

Kutya is known in Poland as &quot;kutia&quot; and &quot;kucja&quot;, where it can be served as part of the Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper, though its origins predate Christianity in Poland and can be traced back to customs of the Slavic Native Faith. However, it is eaten primarily (though not exclusively) in the eastern regions of Podlasie, the Lublin area, and Subcarpathia, near the borders with Belarus and Ukraine. It can also be commonly found among Bug River Poles and other generations with ancestry in the Eastern Borderlands, who are scattered across all of Poland. Besides Wigilia, kutia is also served on New Year&#x27;s Eve and other special occasions, such as wakes. 

Traditional old Polish kutia is made using wheat, poppy seeds (ground in a special pot called &quot;makutra&quot;), honey, raisins, walnuts or hazelnuts, almonds, and vanilla; some recipes also include milk or &quot;śmietana&quot;. Kutia is sometimes prepared using rice or kasha instead of wheat.

A number of customs and rituals in Polish tradition, such as fortune telling, are associated with kutia. This is particularly true for older generations and rural areas of eastern Poland, as well as their descendants who can be found across all regions of Poland. Kutia is also eaten among the Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities living in Poland.

== Other countries ==

A dish of boiled grains (usually wheat berries) mixed with honey, nuts, spices, and a few other ingredients is traditional in other countries as well:

* Bulgaria – kolivo
* Greece – koliva
* Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan – ameh masslouk or snuniye
* Romania – colivă
* Russia – (also) sochivo
* Serbia – koljivo (to wit: sacrifice), or simply: žito (ie, wheat)
* Sicily – cuccìa
* Syria – sliha or burbara (for Eid il-Bur-bara, St. Barbara&#x27;s Feast throughout the Middle East)

Somewhat similar, but with a different origin, and somewhat different ingredients, is the Islamic, especially Turkish, sweet dish of Ashure.

<text>Robert James Ritchie (born January 17, 1971), known professionally as Kid Rock, is an American musician, singer, rapper, and songwriter. After establishing himself in the Detroit hip-hop scene, he broke through into mainstream success with a rap rock sound before shifting his performance style to country rock. A self-taught musician, he has said he can play every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.

Kid Rock started his music career as a rapper, releasing his debut album &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot; (1990), on Jive Records. His subsequent independent releases &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; (1993) and &quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp&quot; (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; (1998), which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, &quot;Cocky&quot; (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip-hop, country, and rock.

His most successful single from that time period, &quot;Cowboy&quot; (1999), is considered a pioneering song in the country rap genre. His best-selling singles overall are &quot;Picture&quot; (2002) and &quot;All Summer Long&quot; (2008). Starting with his 2007 album &quot;Rock n Roll Jesus&quot;, his musical output has tended to be in the country rock style. Politically, Ritchie is a vocal supporter of the U.S. Republican Party and holds conservative views.

==Early life==
Robert James Ritchie was born in Romeo, Michigan, on January 17, 1971, the son of Susan and William &quot;Bill&quot; Ritchie (1941–2024), who owned multiple car dealerships. He was raised in his father&#x27;s large home on extensive property, which included an apple orchard and barnyard for their horses. He attended Romeo High School. His younger sister, Jill Ritchie, is an actress. In the 1980s, Ritchie became interested in hip-hop, began to breakdance, and taught himself how to rap and DJ while performing in talent shows in and around Detroit.

==Career==
===Early career, signing with Jive Records, and &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot; (1988–1991)===
Kid Rock began his professional music career as a member of a hip-hop group called the Beast Crew in the late 1980s. During this time, he met D-Nice. That relationship would eventually lead to him becoming the opening act at local shows for Boogie Down Productions.

During this time, Kid Rock began a professional association with producer Mike E. Clark, who, after some initial skepticism with the idea of a white rapper, found himself impressed with Kid Rock&#x27;s energetic and well-received performance where the artist, using his own turntables and equipment, actually prepared his own beats to demonstrate his skills for Clark.

In 1988, Clark produced a series of demos with Kid Rock. These demos eventually led to offers from six major record labels, including Atlantic and CBS Records.

In 1989, Kid Rock became a shareholder in an independent record label that was formed by Alvin Williams and Earl Blunt of EB-Bran Productions, called &quot;Top Dog&quot; Records. Later, that investment would become a 25% ownership stake.

With the help of D-Nice, Kid Rock signed with Jive Records at the age of 17, releasing his debut studio album, &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot; in 1990. According to Kid Rock, the contract with Jive resulted in animosity from fellow rapper Vanilla Ice, who felt that he should have been signed with Jive instead of Kid Rock.

The album made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local independent rapper Esham. To promote the album, Kid Rock toured nationally with Ice Cube, D-Nice, Yo-Yo and Too Short; Detroit artist James &quot;Blackman&quot; Harris served as Kid Rock&#x27;s DJ on this tour. During instore promotions for the album, Kid Rock met and developed a friendship with local rapper Eminem, who frequently challenged Kid Rock to rap battles.

Ultimately, unfavorable comparisons to Vanilla Ice led to Jive dropping Kid Rock, according to Mike E. Clark.

===Signing with Continuum Records and &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; (1992–1995)===
In 1992, Kid Rock signed with local independent record label Continuum. Around this time, Kid Rock met local hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse through Mike E. Clark, who was producing the duo. While ICP member Violent J disliked Kid Rock&#x27;s music, he wanted the rapper to appear on ICP&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot;, believing the appearance would gain ICP notice, since Kid Rock was a nationally successful artist. Noting that local rapper Esham was paid $500 to appear on ICP&#x27;s album, Violent J claims that Kid Rock demanded $600 () to record his guest appearance, alleging that Esham and Kid Rock had a feud over who was the bigger rapper. Kid Rock showed up to record the song &quot;Is That You?&quot; intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.

In 1993, Kid Rock recorded his second studio album, &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot;, with producer Mike E. Clark, who worked with Kid Rock to help give the album more of a rock-oriented sound than his debut.

Kid Rock also began releasing his &quot;Bootleg&quot; cassette series to keep local interest in his music.

Later in the year, Kid Rock recorded the EP &quot;Fire It Up&quot; at White Room Studios in downtown Detroit, run by brothers Michael and Andrew Nehra, who were forming the rock-soul band Robert Bradley&#x27;s Blackwater Surprise. The EP featured the heavy rock song &quot;I Am the Bullgod&quot; and a cover of Hank Williams Jr.&#x27;s country song &quot;A Country Boy Can Survive&quot;.

By 1994, Kid Rock&#x27;s live performances had mostly been backed by DJs Blackman and Uncle Kracker, but Kid Rock soon began to utilize more and more live instrumentation into his performances, and formed the rock band Twisted Brown Trucker.

After breaking up with his girlfriend, Kid Rock moved engineer Bob Ebeling into his apartment. During a recording session with Mike E. Clark, the producer discovered that Kid Rock could sing when he recorded a reworked cover of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot;, entitled &quot;It&#x27;s Still East Detroit to Me&quot;, which Clark claims led him to encourage Kid Rock to sing more.

During this time, Kid Rock developed animosity towards other Detroit artists, including Insane Clown Posse.

Through extensive promoting, including distributing tapes on consignment to local stores and giving away free samplers of his music, Kid Rock developed a following among an audience which DJ Uncle Kracker described as &quot;white kids who dropped acid and liked listening to gangsta rap&quot;; this following included local rapper Joe C., who had been attending Kid Rock concerts as a fan, but upon meeting Kid Rock, was invited to perform on stage as Kid Rock&#x27;s hype man.

===&quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp&quot; and local breakthrough (1996)===

Kid Rock&#x27;s stage presence became honed with the addition of a light show, pyrotechnics, dancers and a light-up backdrop bearing the name &quot;Kid Rock&quot;, and 1996 saw the release of his most rock-oriented album to date, &quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp&quot;; the album&#x27;s title came from Bob Eberling, who told a sleepless, alcoholic, drug-using Kid Rock, &quot;Dude, you are the early-morning, stoned pimp.&quot; According to Kid Rock, who distributed the album himself, &quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp&quot; sold 14,000 copies.

Kid Rock developed his stage persona, performing dressed in 1970s pimp clothing with a real, possibly loaded, gun down the front of his pants.

Though Kid Rock became known for frequent partying, as well as his drug and alcohol use, he was primarily focused on increasing his success and fame, placing himself as a businessman first; the result of this drive led to increased success locally.

===Signing with Atlantic Records, &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot;, and national success (1997–2000)===
Kid Rock&#x27;s attorney, Tommy Valentino, increased his stature by helping him get articles written about Kid Rock and Twisted Brown Trucker in major publications, including Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Grand Royal&quot; magazine. However, though his management tried to interest local record labels in his music, they told his management team that they were not interested in signing a white rapper, to which Valentino told them, &quot;He&#x27;s not a white rapper. He&#x27;s a rock star and everything in between.&quot;

In 1997, Jason Flom, head of Lava Records, attended one of Kid Rock&#x27;s performances, and met with Kid Rock, who later gave him a demo containing the songs &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Gotta Feel This&quot; and &quot;I Got One for Ya&quot;, which led to Kid Rock signing with Atlantic Records. As part of his recording deal, Kid Rock received $150,000 from the label.

By this time Kid Rock had fully developed his stage persona, and musical style and wanted to make a &quot;redneck, shit-kicking rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll rap&quot; album, resulting in his fourth studio album, &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot;, recorded at the White Room in Detroit and mixed at the Mix Room in Los Angeles.

The album was a commercial smash hit as it would be certified Gold and Platinum several months after its release. In promotion of the record, Kid Rock would join Limp Bizkit on a national tour spanning 27 dates. He made an appearance on the 1999 MTV VMA (including a performance alongside Aerosmith and Run-DMC) and also memorably performed Bawitdaba at Woodstock 1999. &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; sold over 14 million copies, the album&#x27;s success initiated by Kid Rock&#x27;s breakthrough hit single Bawitdaba. In 1999, Kid Rock made his voice acting debut in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;Kill the Alligator and Run&quot; playing himself, alongside Joe C.

Despite having been active in the music industry for over 10 years by then, Kid Rock was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist of 2000. Kid Rock&#x27;s career was sometimes marked by tragedy, as in the death of friend and collaborator Joe C.

In May 2000, Kid Rock released the compilation album &quot;The History of Rock&quot; behind the single &quot;American Bad Ass&quot;. The song sampled Metallica&#x27;s 1991 song &quot;Sad but True&quot;, peaking at No. 20 on the mainstream rock chart. Kid Rock would join Metallica on their 2000 Summer Sanitarium Tour along with Korn and System of a Down. Kid Rock and Jonathan Davis filled in on vocals for an injured James Hetfield in Atlanta on July 7, 2000. Kid Rock performed &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; along with the Metallica classics &quot;Sad but True&quot;, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, &quot;Fuel&quot; and &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; in addition to covers of &quot;Turn the Page&quot; and &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;. &quot;The History of Rock&quot; was certified double platinum.

===Continued success and shift away from hip-hop (2001–2008)===

In 2001, &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; was nominated for the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance, losing out to Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot;. Kid Rock appeared in the comedy film &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;, starring David Spade. Kid Rock was in the live-action/animated film &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;, voicing a bacterial cell version of himself named &quot;Kidney Rock&quot;; Kid Rock and Joe C. had also recorded the song &quot;Cool Daddy Cool&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack album before Joe C.&#x27;s death.

In November 2001, Kid Rock released his fifth studio album, &quot;Cocky&quot;, which was dedicated to Joe C. The album became a hit, spurred by the crossover success of the single &quot;Picture&quot;, a country ballad featuring Sheryl Crow which introduced Kid Rock to a wider audience and was ultimately the most successful single on the album.

In support of the album, Kid Rock performed on the Cocky Tour in 2002 and opened for Aerosmith with Run-DMC on the Girls of Summer Tour. During this period, Uncle Kracker began his solo career full-time. He was replaced by underground Detroit rapper Paradime.

In 2002, Kid Rock covered ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;Legs&quot; to serve as WWE Diva Stacy Keibler&#x27;s theme song; it also appeared on the album &quot;WWF Forceable Entry&quot;.

Kid Rock filed a lawsuit to gain full control over the Top Dog record label, resulting in his receiving full ownership of the label in 2003.

Kid Rock&#x27;s self-titled sixth album was also released in 2003, which shifted his music further away from hip-hop; the lead single was a cover of Bad Company&#x27;s &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot;. The same year, Kid Rock contributed to the tribute album &quot;I&#x27;ve Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings&quot;, honoring the late country singer by covering the song &quot;Luckenbach, Texas&quot; in collaboration with country singer Kenny Chesney.

Kid Rock appeared on the track &#x27;My Name is Robert Too&#x27; on American blues artist R. L. Burnside&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;A Bothered Mind&quot;.
The following year, Kid Rock released his seventh studio album, &quot;Rock n Roll Jesus&quot;, which was his first release to chart at #1 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, selling 172,000 copies in its first week and going on to sell over 5 million copies. In July 2007, Kid Rock was featured in the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine for the second time. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, became a global hit, utilizing a mash up of Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; and Warren Zevon&#x27;s &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;.
In 2008, Kid Rock recorded and made a music video for the song &quot;Warrior&quot; for a National Guard advertising campaign.

===Shift to country rock (2009–present)===

In 2010, Kid Rock released his country-oriented eighth studio album, &quot;Born Free&quot;, produced by Rick Rubin, and featuring guest appearances by Sheryl Crow and Bob Seger.

In 2011, Kid Rock was honored by the NAACP, which sparked protests stemming from his past display of the Confederate flag in his concerts. During the ceremony, Kid Rock elaborated on his display of the flag, stating, &quot;[I] never flew the flag with hate in my heart [...] I love America, I love Detroit, and I love black people.&quot; Kid Rock&#x27;s publicist announced that 2011 was the year he officially distanced himself from the flag.

The following year, Kid Rock performed alongside Travie McCoy and the Roots in honor of Beastie Boys, during the band&#x27;s induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://hiphopdx.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 2012 also saw the release of Kid Rock&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Rebel Soul&quot;; he said that he wanted the album to feel like a greatest hits album, but with new songs. One of the songs on the album, &quot;Cucci Galore&quot;, introduced Kid Rock&#x27;s alter ego, Bobby Shazam.

In 2013, Kid Rock performed on the &quot;Best Night Ever&quot; tour, where he motioned to charge no more than $20 for his tickets (). The following year, he moved to Warner Bros. Records, releasing his only album on the label, &quot;First Kiss&quot;, which he self-produced. The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold more than 354,000 copies in the United States. Subsequently, after leaving Warner Bros., Kid Rock signed with the country label Broken Bow Records.

On July 12, 2017, Kid Rock shared a photo of a &quot;Kid Rock for US Senate&quot; yard sign on Twitter. However, he denied that he was running, citing his upcoming album release and tour. He later clarified that the campaign was a hoax. He donated $122,000, raised by selling &quot;Kid Rock for U.S. Senate&quot; merchandise, to a voter registration group.

Also in July, he released two singles from his next album, &quot;Po-Dunk&quot; and &quot;Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, both released on the same day. In November of that year, he released his eleventh studio album, &quot;Sweet Southern Sugar&quot;. The same year also saw Kid Rock publicly advocate measures against ticket scalpers at his shows by making tickets more affordable for fans. Instead of getting paid for the show, he gets a percentage of concession and ticket sales.

In November 2017, Kid Rock fired his publicist, Kirt Webster, after Webster was accused of sexual misconduct.

In January 2018, the National Hockey League announced Kid Rock as the headlining entertainer for their January 28 All-Star Game, sparking negative online responses from some hockey fans. Former hockey player and commentator Jeremy Roenick praised the choice and condemned Kid Rock&#x27;s critics.

In March 2018, Kid Rock said he would perform on Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s final tour before the Southern rock band retired, alongside Hank Williams Jr., Bad Company, the Marshall Tucker Band and 38 Special.

Kid Rock released his first greatest hits album titled &quot;Greatest Hits: You Never Saw Coming&quot; on September 21, 2018.

On March 29, 2020, Kid Rock released his first single under the name &quot;DJ Bobby Shazam&quot;, entitled &quot;Quarantine&quot;, which featured an old-school hip-hop sound. The artist stated all proceeds from the single&#x27;s sales will go to fight COVID-19.

During Kid Rock&#x27;s 50th birthday livestream, he announced that he would be releasing a triple album consisting of a hip-hop disc, a country music disc and a rock disc which would contain 30 new songs and 20 previously unreleased songs; the first single from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me How To Live&quot;, featuring the band Monster Truck, was released on November 18, 2021, and featured a rap rock sound reminiscent of his &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; album. On December 17, 2021, he released a cover of &quot;Ala-Freaking-Bama&quot; by Trace Adkins titled &quot;Ala-Fuckin-Bama&quot;.

On January 25, 2022, Kid Rock released a single, &quot;We the People&quot;, in which he criticizes the media, Anthony Fauci, face masks, COVID-19 restrictions, and Big Tech to the chorus of &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Brandon&quot;. That same day, he also released &quot;Rockin and &quot;The Last Dance&quot;. On January 28, 2022, he announced on his upcoming &quot;Bad Reputation Tour&quot; that he would not perform at venues that require masks and proof of vaccination and would cancel shows at such places.

On March 10, 2022, Kid Rock announced his upcoming twelfth studio album &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;, which would include his five previously released singles. It digitally released on March 21, while a physical release of the album occurred on April 6.

In January 2023, Kid Rock collaborated with Fueled by 808, Austin Mahone, and Jimmie Allen on the single &quot;No Limits&quot;.

== Musical style, artistry and lyrics ==

In the book &quot;Is Hip Hop Dead? The Past, Present, and Future of America&#x27;s Most Wanted Music&quot;, author Mickey Hess identified Kid Rock as connecting hip-hop to rap rock, due to having started out as a hip-hop artist, before shifting his style from sample-based hip-hop to guitar-driven alternative rock that fused hip-hop beats, boasting and fashion with hard rock guitar and Southern rock attitude, influenced by classic rock and country music. He is a self-taught musician and has said that he can play every instrument used in his band. According to &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;[Kid Rock&#x27;s] own love and incorporation of his musical references isn&#x27;t rooted in a nostalgia or a &#x27;tribute,&#x27; but rather in his actively engaging the elements he finds compelling into a wholly new hodgepodge of his own invention.&quot; Because of this unique musical approach, Kid Rock has been described as a postmodern artist. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; says that Kid Rock&#x27;s style ranges from hard rap to hard rock. &quot;CBS&quot; says that Kid Rock&#x27;s style is a mix of &quot;urban rap, rock and roll [and] country and western.&quot; The musician jokingly described his own style as being &quot;creatively confused&quot;. Reviewing his compilation album &quot;The History of Rock&quot;, David Browne wrote that &quot;Unlike most of his rap-metal peers, Kid Rock doesn&#x27;t merely have personality to burn (and a surprisingly likable one) but a sense of history as well. He may be the first rock star who views Americana as not simply blues, country, and boogie rock but classic hard rock and rap as well.&quot; A 2015 piece by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; said that Kid Rock reinvented &quot;his persona from scrappy hip hop street kid to swaggering rock-rap showman.&quot; Covering him in a 1998 piece, &quot;MTV&quot; described his sound as having &quot;heavy-metal licks and rap riffs&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; described him as a &quot;country rap-rocker&quot; and his music as &quot;rap-meets-rock-meets-country&quot;. &quot;MTV&quot; said that Kid Rock&#x27;s album &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; helped to &quot;ignite the rap-rock genre&quot; and that the musician broke through into mainstream success &quot;during the peak of rap-rock and nü-metal&quot;. In a 2015 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kid Rock disavowed nu metal, saying that the genre was &quot;not melodic and doesn&#x27;t stand the test of time.&quot; In a review of his album &quot;Sweet Southern Sugar&quot;, &quot;Cryptic Rock&quot; said that after &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; established him as a rap rock artist, &quot;albums that were saturated in old school hip hop slowly but surely began to transform into the Southern country rock landscape that has built Kid Rock&#x27;s persona.&quot; In a review of his album &quot;Born Free&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the musician &quot;has slowly abandoned rap for country as he crept closer to middle age&quot;, and while reviewing the subsequent album &quot;Rebel Soul&quot;, Erlewine said that Kid Rock &quot;[planted] his flag on that old-time rock &amp; roll&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; said that Kid Rock &quot;fits comfortably into a modern country-rock landscape that seems practically tailor-made for him: a God-fearing good old boy with a hard-rock heart and an outlaw-country spirit.&quot; Kid Rock&#x27;s influences include Bob Seger and Beastie Boys. Regarding his influences, Kid Rock said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there isn&#x27;t anything that hasn&#x27;t influenced me musically.&quot;

Summarizing his lyrical themes in a review of his album &quot;Cocky&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote of Kid Rock, &quot;Anyone willing to chug Buds, smoke pot, and salute the flag can find a place in Rock&#x27;s unexpectedly optimistic dreamworld, where the sleaze nation commingles in a warped fantasy of pan-trash peace and harmony.&quot; The magazine categorized his lyrics as describing the &quot;ideal of a world where rappers can sip whiskey with rednecks&quot;. According to Kid Rock, a fundamental theme in the lyrics of his songs is that &quot;there&#x27;s still a lot of good left in people, no matter what they do&quot;, reflected in his lyrics for &quot;Bawitdaba&quot;, which he dedicated to, among others, &quot;topless dancers&quot; and drug users. He explained in a 2000 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a lot of faith in people. Whether it&#x27;s some kid with a trust fund that people tease because he&#x27;s got a trust fund, you know. I think there&#x27;s some good ones out there, just like I think there&#x27;s some good crackheads out there. It works both ways.&quot; Kid Rock developed a &quot;redneck pimp&quot; alter ego to complement his humorous lyrics. According to Kid Rock, &quot;I use straightforward words, you know. I&#x27;m not politically correct.&quot;

His song &quot;Cowboy&quot; is considered a pioneering song in the country rap genre. &quot;Cowboys &amp; Indians&quot; claims that &quot;Cowboy&quot; had a major impact on the country music scene; the magazine wrote that artists Jason Aldean and Big &amp; Rich, among others, were influenced by the song&#x27;s country rap style. Kid Rock also had an impact on hip-hop, serving as an influence on rappers like Yelawolf.

==Personal life==

In eighth grade, Ritchie began an on-and-off relationship with classmate Kelley South Russell that lasted for the next decade. In summer 1993, Russell gave birth to their son, Robert James Ritchie Jr. They raised a total of three children together, two of whom Ritchie believed to be his. They split up in late 1993 when Ritchie discovered that only one of the two was his. He subsequently raised his son as a single father.

In 2000, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Ritchie was dating model Jaime King. He began dating actress Pamela Anderson in 2001 and they became engaged in April 2002, but ended their relationship in 2003. They later reconciled and were married in July 2006. Three months later, on November 10, it was announced that Anderson, who had been pregnant with Ritchie&#x27;s child, had miscarried. On November 27, she filed for divorce from Ritchie in Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences. Ritchie later claimed that the divorce was due to Anderson openly criticizing his mother and sister in front of his son.

In 2014, Ritchie became a grandfather when his son&#x27;s girlfriend gave birth to a daughter. In November 2017, he became engaged to longtime girlfriend Audrey Berry. The couple met not long after he and Anderson finalized their divorce in 2007. By 2025, the couple were no longer together.

Ritchie is an ordained minister and has a firearm collection. He has called Nashville a part-time home since 2005, and also splits time between his native Detroit and Alabama.

== Public image and controversies ==

Ritchie oversees The Kid Rock Foundation, a charity which raises funds for multiple causes, including campaigns which sent &quot;Kid Rock care packages&quot; to U.S. military personnel stationed overseas. Ritchie is an advocate for affordable concert tickets. He sells tickets for as low as possible to increase concert attendance for lower income consumers, and to discourage scalping. Instead of getting paid for the show, he gets a percentage of concession and ticket sales.

In 1989, Ritchie became a shareholder of the independent record label Top Dog Records, formed by Alvin Williams and Earl Blunt of EB-Bran Productions, in 1988; Ritchie&#x27;s investment in the company gave him 25% ownership. In 2001, he filed a lawsuit to gain full control over the Top Dog record label, resulting in his receiving full ownership of the label in 2003. Ritchie also founded Kid Rock&#x27;s Made in Detroit restaurant and bar, which specializes in Southern-style cuisine.

In March 1991 and again in September 1997, Ritchie faced misdemeanor charges stemming from alcohol-related arrests in Michigan.

Also in 1997, Kid Rock wrote the song &quot;Cool, Daddy Cool&quot; which was later used in the 2001 children&#x27;s movie Osmosis Jones. In the song, Kid Rock said the controversial lyrics &quot;Young ladies, young ladies, I like &#x27;em underage see, Some say that&#x27;s statutory (But I say it&#x27;s mandatory)&quot;, with Joe C. saying the mandatory line.

In 2002, Kid Rock performed alongside Chuck D and Grandmaster Flash in tribute to slain DJ Jam Master Jay. In September 2005, Kid Rock filled in for Johnny Van Zant, the lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd, on the band&#x27;s hit &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; at the Hurricane Katrina benefit concert.

Kid Rock&#x27;s performance at Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 drew criticism from Veterans of Foreign Wars and Senator Zell Miller for cutting a hole in an American flag and wearing it as a poncho; Ritchie was accused of &quot;desecrating&quot; the flag.

In January 2005, Ritchie performed at the inaugural address of reelected president George W. Bush, sparking criticism from conservative groups, due to singing about &quot;how he sexually exploits every girl and then asks them if he can do it with their moms&quot;.

Also in 2005, Ritchie was charged with assaulting a DJ in a strip club.

In 2006, California pornographic film company Red Light District attempted to distribute a 1999 sex tape in which Kid Rock and Scott Stapp, lead singer of the band Creed, are seen partying and receiving oral sex from groupies; both Rock and Stapp filed with the California courts to sue the pornographers to stop the tape&#x27;s distribution.

At the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, Ritchie got into a fistfight with Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, another ex of Pamela Anderson&#x27;s, and was charged with assault. A month later, he was arrested and charged with battery after fighting with a Waffle House customer. He pleaded no contest to one count and was fined $1,000, as well as being required to perform 80 hours of community service and complete a six-hour anger management course.

In 2007 and 2008, Ritchie toured for the United Service Organizations. Also in 2008, Ritchie recorded and made a music video for the song &quot;Warrior&quot; for a National Guard advertising campaign.
In 2011, Ritchie was honored by the NAACP, which sparked protests stemming from his past display of the Confederate flag in his concerts. During the ceremony, Kid Rock elaborated on his display of the flag, stating, &quot;[I] never flew the flag with hate in my heart [...] I love America, I love Detroit, and I love black people.&quot; Ritchie&#x27;s publicist announced that 2011 was the year he officially distanced himself from the flag. Kid Rock stopped displaying the Confederate flag at his concerts since 2007.

In 2012, Kid Rock performed alongside Travie McCoy and the Roots in honor of Beastie Boys, during the band&#x27;s induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 2013, Ritchie criticized Republican lawmakers in New York for passing laws which made it difficult for him to keep concert ticket prices low.

In 2015, following the Charleston church shooting, the Michigan chapter of the National Action Network protested outside of the Detroit Historical Museum which honored Ritchie; activists urged Ritchie to renounce the Confederate flag, which he had displayed in concerts from 2001 to 2006. Ritchie wrote an email to Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly, stating, &quot;Please tell the people who are protesting to kiss my ass&quot;. The same day, the National Action Network protested Chevrolet for sponsoring Ritchie&#x27;s tour.

In September 2016, Ritchie was criticized for allegedly saying &quot;man, fuck Colin Kaepernick&quot; during a live performance of his song &quot;Born Free&quot;.

On April 6, 2018, Ritchie was inducted into the Celebrity Wing of the WWE Hall of Fame during the weekend of WrestleMania 34.

On November 30, 2019, Ritchie drew controversy after he was recorded making a series of inappropriate and inflammatory statements while intoxicated at his restaurant in Nashville, including about Oprah Winfrey and Joy Behar. After receiving major pushback for his comments, Ritchie decided to close the Detroit branch of his restaurant in December 2019, located at the Little Caesar&#x27;s Arena. When asked for comment about the closure, he stated that &quot;it&#x27;s wise to go where you&#x27;re celebrated, not tolerated&quot;. In a June 2022 interview with Tucker Carlson on &quot;Tucker Carlson Originals: Life of a Rockstar&quot;, Ritchie said he had nothing to apologize for regarding the incident.

In June 2021, Kid Rock attracted further controversy for using the word &quot;faggot&quot; onstage during a tirade against fans who were filming his performance. He later defended his remarks while &quot;reaffirming his love for his homosexual friends&quot;. In July 2022 he faced additional accusations of homophobia after, on June 30, 2022, he posted a meme on Truth Social and on Twitter stating, &quot;If you&#x27;re anti-gun, you don&#x27;t get to celebrate the 4th of July, You would have never fought back. Enjoy your pride month. Pussy.&quot;

On April 3, 2023, Kid Rock posted a video on Twitter in which he is shown shooting cases of Bud Light beer cans with a submachine gun, which was seen as being in response to an advertising campaign by Anheuser-Busch that features transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. After the shooting, he exclaims, &quot;Fuck Bud Light. Fuck Anheuser-Busch.&quot; He was one of key conservative influencers, alongside Sebastian Gorka, Candace Owens and Vince Dao whose push eventually led to the 2023 Bud Light boycott and which caused a large drop in sales of Bud Light. He later promoted the Happy Dad brand; which has partnered with Caitlyn Jenner, who is a transgender woman. In August, he was pictured drinking a can of Bud Light at a Colt Ford concert in Nashville.

==Politics and views==

Ritchie is a supporter of the Republican Party, although he has routinely proclaimed himself as libertarian philosophically, stating he has socially liberal views on topics like abortion and gay marriage but conservative views on economics. Ritchie has advocated legalizing and taxing marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. He has also stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think crazy people should have guns.&quot; He was a vocal supporter of American military involvement in the Iraq War. Ritchie has met with presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump while they were in office. Regarding his political views, Ritchie said, &quot;I have friends everywhere. Democrat, Republican, this that and the other. ... We&#x27;re all human beings first, Americans second. Let&#x27;s find some common ground and get along.&quot; During his speech at the 2018 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, he stated that he wanted to &quot;body slam some Democrats&quot;.

Ritchie supported Bill Clinton and George W. Bush during their presidencies. In 2008, Ritchie supported newly elected President Barack Obama, saying that Obama&#x27;s election was &quot;a great thing for black people.&quot; In 2012, Ritchie campaigned for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney; the candidate used Ritchie&#x27;s song &quot;Born Free&quot; as his campaign theme. In 2015, Ritchie publicly endorsed Ben Carson for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. In February 2016, he voiced approval for Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign for the same office. In December, Kid Rock sparked controversy for selling T-shirts supporting Trump at concerts, including one showing a map of the United States which labelled the states which had voted against Trump as &quot;Dumbfuckistan&quot;.

On July 12, 2017, Ritchie shared a photo of a &quot;Kid Rock for US Senate&quot; yard sign on Twitter. He also launched a website at kidrockforsenate.com, which sold merchandise bearing that inscription. Several weeks later, he wrote a post on his blog stating that he was still &quot;exploring my candidacy&quot;, and that, whether or not he ran, he wanted to register people to vote, because &quot;although people are unhappy with the government, too few are even registered to vote or do anything about it.&quot; He added that he wanted &quot;to help working class people in Michigan and America all while still calling out these jackass lawyers who call themselves politicians.&quot; His statements sparked media speculation that he would try to run on the Republican ticket against sitting Michigan senator Debbie Stabenow, as well as enthusiasm from some prominent Republicans, including former New York Governor George Pataki, who wrote on Twitter, &quot;Kid Rock is exactly the kind of candidate the GOP needs right now.&quot; In an October 2017 interview with Howard Stern, Ritchie put an end to the speculation, saying that he had never intended to run for Senate, adding rhetorically, &quot;Who couldn&#x27;t figure that out?&quot;. He later clarified that the campaign was a joke that he had started after a Michigan state legislator encouraged him to run for Senate. He expressed surprise at the interest his potential candidacy had received, but also disappointment that some opposed to his candidacy had brought up his previous use of the Confederate flag to label him a racist. He donated the $122,000 he had raised by selling &quot;Kid Rock for U.S. Senate&quot; merchandise to CRNC Action, a College Republican group.

On July 18, 2024, Ritchie performed his song &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; for the 2024 Republican National Convention with modified lyrics to show his support for Trump.

<text>Knaresborough Castle is a ruined fortress overlooking the River Nidd in the town of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, England.

==History==
The castle was first built by a Norman baron in on a cliff above the River Nidd. There is documentary evidence dating from 1130 referring to works carried out at the castle by Henry I. In the 1170s Hugh de Moreville and his followers took refuge there after assassinating Thomas Becket.

William de Stuteville was appointed as Governor of Knaresborough castle in Easter 1173. After de Stuteville&#x27;s death in 1203, King John gave Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, custody of all of William de Stuteville&#x27;s lands and castles and the wardship of his son and heir Robert de Stuteville. However, Robert died in 1205 and William&#x27;s brother Nicholas de Stuteville became William&#x27;s heir. A charter dated at Lambeth 5 August 1205 confirmed that Nicholas had paid a fine of 10,000 marks for his inheritance, with the exception of the castles of Knaresborough and Boroughbridge, which were retained by the King.

The King regarded Knaresborough as an important northern fortress and spent £1,290 on improvements to the castle. In August 1304, Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, a daughter of Edward I, travelled from Linlithgow Palace to Knaresborough Castle. She gave birth to her son, Humphrey, in September, assisted by a holy relic of the girdle of the Virgin, brought especially from Westminster Abbey.

The castle was rebuilt at a cost of £2,174 between 1307 and 1312 by Edward I and completed by Edward II, including the great keep. Edward II gave the castle to Piers Gaveston and stayed there himself when the unpopular nobleman was besieged at Scarborough Castle.

Philippa of Hainault took possession of the castle in 1331, at which point it became a royal residence. The queen often spent summers there with her family. Her son, John of Gaunt acquired the castle in 1372, adding it to the vast holdings of the Duchy of Lancaster. Katherine Swynford, Gaunt&#x27;s third wife, obtained the castle upon his death.

A detailed survey of the state of the castle buildings was made in 1561. The building was used by estate auditors and law courts were held in the hall.

The castle was taken by Parliamentarian troops in 1644 during the Civil War and largely destroyed in 1648, not as the result of warfare but because of an order from Parliament to dismantle all Royalist castles. Indeed many town-centre buildings are built of &#x27;castle stone&#x27;.

== Present day ==
The remains of the castle are open to the public and there is a charge for entry to the interior remains. The grounds are used as a public leisure space, with a bowling green and putting green open during the summer. It is also used as a performing space. It plays host to frequent events, such as the annual FEVA (Festival of Visual Arts and Entertainment). The property is owned by the monarch as part of the Duchy of Lancaster holdings, but is administered by North Yorkshire Council.
==Description==
The castle, now much ruined, comprised two walled baileys set one behind the other, with the outer bailey on the town side and the inner bailey on the cliff side. The enclosure wall was punctuated by solid towers along its length, and a pair, visible today, formed the main gate. At the junction between the inner and outer baileys, on the north side of the castle stood a tall five-sided keep, the eastern parts of which have been pulled down. The keep had a vaulted basement, at least three upper stories, and served as a residence for the lord of the castle throughout the castle&#x27;s history. The castle baileys contained residential buildings, and some foundations have survived. In 1789, historian Ely Hargrove wrote that the castle contained &quot;only three rooms on a floor, and measures, in front, only fifty-four feet.&quot;

The upper storey of the Courthouse features a museum that includes furniture from the original Tudor Court, as well as exhibits about the castle and the town.

<text>Calligra Suite is a graphic art and office suite by KDE. It is available for desktop PCs, tablet computers, and smartphones. It contains applications for word processing, spreadsheets, presentation, databases, vector graphics, and digital painting.

Calligra uses the OpenDocument format as its default file format for most applications and can import other formats, such as Microsoft Office formats. Calligra relies on KDE technology and is often used in combination with KDE Plasma Workspaces.

== Supported systems ==

=== Desktops ===
Calligra&#x27;s main platform is desktop PCs running Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and Windows, of which Linux is the best supported system.

On desktop systems, the whole range of features is available.

=== Smartphones and tablets ===
, Calligra&#x27;s efforts to create touchscreen-friendly versions are centered on reusable Qt Quick components. For smartphone-like formfactors 3rd party documents viewers Coffice for Android and Sailfish Office for Sailfish OS are available that make use of these components.

The Calligra project shipped Krita Sketch/Gemini and the tablet-focused Plasma Active document viewer with Calligra 2.8. Calligra 2.9 ships Calligra Gemini, an enhanced version of Calligra Active with added document editing features and runtime switching between desktop and touchscreen interfaces.

== History ==


Calligra was created after disagreements within the KOffice community in 2010 – between KWord maintainer Thomas Zander and the other core developers. (See .) Following arbitration with the community members, several applications were renamed by both parties. Most developers, and all but KWord maintainer Thomas Zander, of particular applications joined the Calligra project. Three applications, Kexi, Krita and KPlato and the user interfaces for mobile devices have been completely moved out of KOffice and are only available within Calligra. A new application called Braindump has been added to Calligra after the split and KWord was replaced by the new word processor Calligra Words.

KOffice 2.3, released 31 December 2010, along with subsequent bugfix releases (2.3.1–2.3.3) was still a collaborative effort of both the KOffice and Calligra development teams. According to its developers, this version is stable enough for real use, and Karbon14, Krita and KSpread are recommended for production work.

On 18 May 2011, the Calligra team began releasing monthly snapshots while preparing for the release of Calligra 2.4.

The first version of the Calligra Suite for Windows was released on 21 December 2011. The package is labeled as “highly experimental” and “not yet suitable for daily use”.

The Calligra team was originally scheduled to release the final 2.4 version in January 2012 but problems in the undo/redo feature of Words and Stage required a partial rewrite and caused a delay. Calligra 2.4 was released on 11 April 2012.

Calligra 2.4 launched with two mobile-oriented user interfaces: Calligra Mobile and Calligra Active. Calligra Mobile&#x27;s development was initiated in summer 2009 and was first shown during Akademy / Desktop Summit 2009 by KO GmbH as a simple port of KOffice to Maemo. Later Nokia hired KO to assist them with a full-fledged mobile version, including a touchscreen-friendly user interface which was presented by Nokia during Maemo Conference in October 2009. The first alpha version was made available in January 2010. Along with the launch of the Nokia N9 smartphone, Nokia released its own Poppler and Calligra-based office document viewer under GPL.

&quot;Calligra Active&quot; was launched in 2011 after the Plasma Active initiative to provide a document viewer similar to &quot;Calligra Mobile&quot; but for tablet computers.

In December 2012, KDE, KO GmbH, and Intel released Krita Sketch, a variant of Calligra&#x27;s Krita painting application, for Windows 7 and 8.

On 24 March 2013, KDE developer Sebastian Sauer released &quot;Coffice&quot;, a Calligra-based document viewer, for Android.

Jolla continued Nokia&#x27;s efforts on a smartphone version. In 2013 Jolla launched Sailfish Office. Sailfish Office reuses the Qt Quick components from Calligra Active.
In September 2013 a merger of Krita and Krita Sketch, named Krita Gemini, was launched on Windows 8.1. Development was funded by Intel to promote &quot;2in1&quot; convertible notebooks. On 5 March 2014 Krita Sketch and Gemini were also released as part of Calligra 2.8 for non-Windows platforms.

In April 2014, Intel and KO GmbH extended the promotion deal to Gemini versions of Stage and Words. On 28 August 2014, the first snapshot of Calligra Gemini was released by KO GmbH for Windows. On 21 November 2014, KDE announced that Calligra Gemini would officially be released as part of Calligra 2.9. As with Krita, this Gemini release adds a touchscreen interface to Words and Stage and users can switch between desktop and touch mode at runtime. Calligra Gemini is a continuation of Calligra Active and Sailfish Office developments but with added editing capabilities. On 19 October 2014, a Linux version was presented.

The koffice.org website was replaced by a placeholder in early September 2012. KOffice was declared unmaintained by KDE. The koffice.org domain now redirects to Calligra.org.

In Autumn 2015, Krita was split off into a project independent from Calligra, with the then current 2.9 versions though still developed as part of Calligra 2.9.

== Components ==


== Reception ==

Initial reception shortly after the 2.4 release was positive. Linux Pro Magazine Online&#x27;s Bruce Byfield wrote &quot;Calligra needed an impressive first release. Perhaps surprisingly, and to the development team&#x27;s credit, it has managed one in 2.4&quot;, but also noted that &quot;Words in particular is still lacking features&quot;. He concluded that Calligra is &quot;worth keeping an eye on&quot;.

The German sister publication LinuxUser 10/2012 reviewed Calligra 2.5 on 12 September 2012. Its reception was mostly positive. Negative criticism centered on Words&#x27; stability: &quot;During our review no Calligra module was completely free of crashes, however Words&#x27; crashes reached an amount that we cannot recommend it for general use.&quot; The reviewer Thomas Drilling on the other hand praised Calligra&#x27;s usability, writing: &quot;The consistent work flow, often stunningly intuitive workflows, and clear menu structure are well received.&quot; He then concluded: &quot;The individual modules&#x27; quality varies: While Words shows weakness, image editor Krita, spreadsheet application Sheets, and presentation program Stage completely won us over. Flowcharting application Flow allures with its wide range of stencils which makes drawing flow charts come easy.&quot;

LinuxUser reviewed Calligra 2.6 in issue 3/2013. Reviewer Vincze-Aron Szabo reiterated positive criticism about Calligra&#x27;s user interface and noted increased stability of Words compared to Calligra 2.5. Szabo&#x27;s major point for negative criticism was Author&#x27;s and Word&#x27;s handling of long documents, resulting in decreased performance and crashes. The other reviewed components – Plan, Stage, Sheets, and Krita – were praised in terms of stability and intuitiveness.

Calligra 2.7 was reviewed by LinuxUser in its October 2013 issue. Thomas Drilling, the reviewer, drew a positive conclusion overall. Among the positive aspects he pointed out were better &quot;.docx&quot; file import than LibreOffice and the amount of new features gained by the new version of the suite. Source for negative criticism was once again Words&#x27; stability, although Drilling noted improvements in this regard.

Network World editor Bryan Lunduke wrote about Calligra 2.8 in March 2014: “Karbon is an astoundingly nice vector design tool, and Flow, a diagramming tool, is incredibly handy from the design point of view as well. […] And Words is a great word processor.” In August 2014 he wrote: “Calligra Suite has become a staple of my workflow even on non-KDE desktops.” Linux Insider also reviewed Calligra 2.8, concluding “Calligra Suite is a solid offering that has grown considerably since branching out from its traditional KOffice roots. It has something for everyone. Its tools fills the needs of writers, artists, content designers and office workers.”

In 2017, sempreupdate.com.br wrote: “&quot;[If you do not] depend on proprietary formats [...] especially .xls, .xlsx and .doc [...] and you use KDE it&#x27;s worth trying. Yes, regarding LibreOffice Calligra is still two steps behind [but] it also brings small differentials that would be welcomed in LibreOffice.&quot;“

== Technical details ==
Calligra is written with dependencies on KDE Frameworks 6 and Qt 6. Older versions depend on KDE Frameworks 5/Qt5, KDE Platform 4 and Qt 4, and even older versions of KOffice depend on KDElibs and Qt 3. Despite that Calligra Suite is released independently of the KDE Software Compilation or of the KDE Applications.

All components of the Calligra Suite are released under free software licenses and use OpenDocument as their native file format when applicable.

The developers of Calligra plan to share as much infrastructure as possible between applications to reduce bugs and improve the user experience. This is done by common technologies like Flake and Pigment. Flake provides a way to handle shapes, which can contain text, images, formulas (via KFormula), charts (via KChart) or other objects, in a consistent way across all applications. The Calligra team also wants to create an OpenDocument library for use in other KDE applications that will allow developers to easily add support for reading and outputting OpenDocument files to their applications. Automating tasks and extending the suite with custom functionality can be done with D-Bus. Previously it was possible to also use scripting languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript through the Kross scripting framework.

<doc id="17401" wikidata="Q315594" url="?curid=17401" title="Fumimaro Konoe">
<text>was a Japanese politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan from 1937 to 1939 and from 1940 to 1941. He presided over the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and breakdown in relations with the United States, which shortly after his tenure culminated in Japan&#x27;s entry into World War II. Konoe played a central role in transforming Japan into a totalitarian state by pushing through the State General Mobilization Law and establishing the Imperial Rule Assistance Association while dissolving all other political parties.

Born in Tokyo to a prominent aristocratic family, Konoe graduated from Kyoto University and took up his father&#x27;s seat in the House of Peers in 1916. He was a member of the Japanese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference following World War I, and served as president of the House of Peers from 1933 to 1937. By June 1937, Konoe became prime minister of the Japanese government on the recommendation of his mentor Saionji Kinmochi. When the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place a month later, he oversaw an escalation of tensions with the Republic of China which ultimately culminated in the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the early years of the conflict, Konoe presided over a series of crushing victories against Chinese forces as well as the perpetration of numerous atrocities (including the Nanjing Massacre). In 1938, he enacted the State General Mobilization Law which massively expanded the government&#x27;s control over Japanese civilians in order to place the country on a war footing. One year later, Konoe resigned as the Japanese military proved unable to achieve a decisive victory in China. 

After resigning as Japan&#x27;s head of government in 1939, Konoe served as chairman of the Privy Council until being once again appointed prime minister of Japan in July 1940. Later that year, he founded the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and oversaw the signing of the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. During his second premiership, Konoe also presided over the Japanese invasion of French Indochina, the formal recognition of Wang Jingwei&#x27;s puppet government in Nanjing and the conclusion of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact. Despite attempting to resolve growing tensions with the United States, a rigid timetable imposed by the military on the negotiations and Konoe&#x27;s own inflexibility set the two countries on the path to war. Politically isolated, Konoe resigned as premier in October 1941 and was replaced by Hideki Tojo. Six weeks later, the Pacific War broke out after Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor.

Konoe remained a close advisor to Emperor Hirohito until the end of World War II and played a key role in the fall of the Tōjō Cabinet in 1944. At the start of the Allied occupation of Japan in 1945, he briefly served as a minister in the cabinet of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, but came under suspicion of war crimes. In December, Konoe committed suicide by ingesting cyanide before he could be arrested by the authorities.

==Early life==

Fumimaro Konoe (often &quot;Konoye&quot;), was born in Tokyo on 12 October 1891 to the prominent Konoe family, one of the main branches of the ancient Fujiwara clan. This made the Konoe &quot;head of the most prestigious, and highest ranking noble house in the realm.&quot; They had first become independent of the Fujiwara in the 12th century, when Minamoto no Yoritomo divided the Fujiwara into the Five Regent Houses (&quot;go-sekke&quot;). Japanese historian Eri Hotta described the Konoe as &quot;First among the go-sekke&quot;; Fumimaro would be its 29th leader. While the average height of Japanese people at that time was around 160 cm (5 ft 3 in), Konoe was over 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall.

Konoe&#x27;s father, Atsumaro, had been politically active, having organized the Anti-Russia Society in 1903. Fumimaro&#x27;s mother died shortly after his birth; his father then married her younger sister. Fumimaro was misled into thinking she was his real mother, and found out the truth when he was 12 years old after his father&#x27;s death.

Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1912, Fumimaro not only inherited his father&#x27;s aristocratic title of &quot;koshaku&quot; (duke or prince) but also his debt. Thanks to the financial support of the zaibatsu Sumitomo, which he received throughout his career, and the auction of Fujiwara heirlooms, the family was able to become solvent. Fumimaro&#x27;s younger brother, Hidemaro Konoye, later became a symphony conductor and founded NHK Symphony Orchestra.

After graduating from Taimei Elementary School, he went on to study at Gakushuin, which was an institution to educate the children of the children of Japan&#x27;s nobility. He was inspired by Inazo Nitobe, the dean of the First Higher School. Uncharacteristically for someone from a high-ranking aristocratic background, he chose to study at the First Higher School for university preparatory education, instead of staying at Gakushuin. Upon graduating in 1912, he proceeded to study philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University, where he again studied together with his former peers from Gakushuin. Konoe subsequently transferred to the law department of Kyoto Imperial University. One of his professors was the Marxist economist Hajime Kawakami. Under Kawakami&#x27;s influence, Konoe became interested in socialism as a student and wrote a Japanese translation Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Soul of Man Under Socialism.&quot;

While in Kyoto, Konoe met the genrō Saionji Kinmochi and became his protégé. After graduation, Fumimaro turned to Saionji for advice about starting a political career, and worked briefly in the home ministry before accompanying his mentor to Versailles as part of the Japanese peace delegation.

In December 1918, Konoe also published an essay entitled &quot;Reject the Anglo-American-Centered Pacifism&quot; (英米本位の平和主義を排す, &quot;eibei-hon&#x27;i no heiwashugi o haisu&quot;). In this article, he argued that western democracies were supporting democracy, peace, and self-determination only hypocritically, while actually undermining those ideals through racially discriminatory imperialism. He attacked the League of Nations as an effort to institutionalize the status quo: colonial hegemony by the western powers. Following a translation by American journalist Thomas Franklin Fairfax Millard, Saionji wrote a rebuttal in his journal, &quot;Millard&#x27;s Review of the Far East&quot;. Saionji considered Konoe&#x27;s writing reckless, but, after it became internationally read, Konoe was invited to dinner by Sun Yat-sen. Sun admired Japan&#x27;s quick modernization; at the dinner, they discussed pan-Asian nationalism.

During the Paris Peace Conference, Konoe was one of the Japanese diplomats who proposed the Racial Equality Proposal for the Covenant of the League of Nations. When the Racial Equality Clause came up before the committee, it received the support of Japan, France, Serbia, Greece, Italy, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, and China. However, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson overturned the vote, declaring that the clause needed unanimous support. Konoe regarded the rejection of the Racial Equality Clause as a significant setback and a reflection of discriminatory attitudes toward Japan.

Upon his return to Japan he published a booklet where he described his travels to France, Britain and the U.S. Konoe noted how he was angered by rising anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States and how the US government discriminated against Japanese immigrants. He also described China as a rival to Japan in international relations.

== House of Peers ==

In 1916, while at university, Fumimaro took his father&#x27;s seat in the House of Peers, upper house of the Imperial Diet. After his return from Europe he was aggressively recruited by the most powerful political faction of Japan&#x27;s budding Taishō democracy of the 1920s: the &quot;kenkyukai&quot;, a conservative, militaristic faction, led by Yamagata Aritomo and generally opposed to democratic reform. In September 1922, he joined them.

The opposing faction was the &quot;seiyukai&quot;, led by Hara Takashi, which drew its strength from the lower house. Eventually the &quot;seiyukai&quot; was able to gain the Aritomo&#x27;s support, and Hara Takashi became prime minister in 1918. Konoe believed the House of Peers should stay neutral in factional party politics, lest a partisan-seeming peerage have their privileges restricted. He therefore supported Takashi&#x27;s &quot;seiyukai&quot; government, as did most of the &quot;kenkyukai&quot;.

However, by 1923, the &quot;seiyukai&quot; had split into two factions and could no longer control the government. During the premiership of Kato Komei and his party, the &quot;kenseikai&quot;, Konoe supported universal male suffrage to forestall serious curtailment of the noble privileges. Konoe believed universal male suffrage was the best way to channel popular discontent and thereby reduce the chance of violent revolution. As the house of peers became allied with different political factions in the lower house, Konoe left the &quot;kenkyukai&quot; in November 1927.

Like his position in regard to the nobility, he believed that the emperor should not take political positions. In his eyes, a political emperor would diminish the imperial prestige, undermine the unifying power of the throne, expose the emperor to criticism, and potentially undermine domestic tranquillity. His greatest fear in this period of rapid industrialization would become the threat of left-wing revolution, facilitated by the petty factionalism of Taishō democracy&#x27;s political factions. He saw the peerage as a bulwark of stability committed to tranquillity, harmony, and the maintenance of the status quo. Its function was to restrain the excesses of the elected government, but its power had to be used sparingly.

== Alliance with Home Ministry ==
The Japanese home ministry was extremely powerful, in charge of the police, elections, public works, Shinto shrines, and land development. The home ministry was also abused to influence elections in favour of the ruling party. Despite having once believed it to be beneath the dignity of a nobleman, Konoe entered into an alliance with important home ministry officials. The most important among these officials was Yoshiharu Tazawa, whom he met after he became the managing director of the Japan Youth Hall (&quot;Nippon Seinenkan&quot;) in 1921. Konoe and his allies saw the influence of local &quot;meiboka&quot; political bosses as a threat to Japan&#x27;s political stability. Universal suffrage had opened the vote to the undereducated peasantry, but local bosses, using pork-barrel politics, manipulated their influence on the government. These officials also shared Konoe&#x27;s concern about party influence within the home ministry, which had seen great turnover mirroring the political upheaval occurring in the Diet. Konoe&#x27;s association with the youth hall began two months after the publication of an article in July 1921, where he stressed education of the electorate&#x27;s political wisdom and morality, and lamented that education only taught youth to accept ideas passively from their superiors. The Youth Corps (&quot;Seinendan&quot;) was thereafter created to foster a moral sense of civic duty among the people, with the overall purpose of destroying the &quot;meiboka&quot; system.

In 1925, Konoe and these officials formed the Alliance for a New Japan (&quot;Shin Nippon Domei&quot;), which endorsed the concept of representative government but rejected the value of party and local village bosses, instead advocating that new candidates from outside the parties should run for office. The Association for Election Purification (&quot;Senkyo Shukusei Dōmeikai&quot;) was also created, an organization whose purpose was to circumvent and weaken pork-barrel local politics by supporting candidates that were not beholden to &quot;meiboka&quot; bosses. The alliance formed a political party (&quot;meiseikai&quot;) but was unable to secure popular support and dissolved within two years of formation (in 1928).

== Road to first premiership ==
In the 1920s Japanese foreign policy was largely in line with Anglo-American policy, the Treaty of Versailles, and the Washington Naval Conference treaty, and there was agreement between the great powers over the establishment of an independent Chinese state. A flourishing party system controlled the cabinet in alliance with industry. The Great Depression of the 1930s, the rise of Soviet military power in the east, further insistence on limitations to Japanese naval power, and increased Chinese resistance to Japanese aggression in Asia marked the abandonment of Japanese cooperation with the Anglo-American powers. The Japanese government began to seek autonomy in foreign policy, and – as the sense of crisis deepened – unity and mobilization became overarching imperatives.

Konoe assumed the vice presidency of the House of Peers in 1931. In 1932, political parties lost control of the cabinet. Thenceforth, cabinets were formed by alliances of political elites and military factions. As Japan mobilized its resources for war, the government increased suppression of political parties and what remained of the left wing. Konoe ascended to the presidency of the House of Peers in 1933 and spent the next few years mediating between elite political factions, elite policy consensus, and national unity.

Meanwhile, Fumimaro sent his eldest son Fumitaka to study in the U.S., at Princeton, wishing to prepare him for politics and make him an able proponent of Japan in America. Unlike most of his elite contemporaries, Fumimaro had not been educated abroad due to his father&#x27;s poor finances. Fumimaro visited Fumitaka in 1934 and he was shocked by rising anti-Japanese sentiment. This experience deepened his resentment of the U.S., which he perceived as selfish and racist, and which he blamed for its failure to avert economic disaster. In a speech in 1935, Konoe said that the &quot;monopolization&quot; of resources by the Anglo-American alliance must end and be replaced by an &quot;international new deal&quot; to help countries like Japan take care of their growing populations.

Konoe&#x27;s views were thus a recapitulation of those he had expressed at Versailles almost 20 years earlier. He still believed that Japan was the equal and the rival of the western powers, that Japan had a right to expansion in China, that such expansion was &quot;survival&quot;, and that the &quot;Anglo-American powers were hypocrites seeking to enforce their economic dominance of the world&quot;.

==Prime Minister and war with China==

Despite his tutelage under the liberal-leaning Saionji Kinmochi, his study of socialism at university, and his support of universal suffrage, he seemed to have had a contradictory attraction to fascism, which angered and alarmed the ageing . At a costume party before Saionji&#x27;s daughter was married in 1937, he dressed as Adolf Hitler. Despite these misgivings, Saionji nominated Konoe to the Emperor Hirohito, and in June 1937 Konoe became Prime Minister.

Upon assuming office, First Konoe Cabinet spent the short time between then and war with China attempting to secure pardons for the ultranationalist leaders of the 26 February incident, who had attempted to assassinate his mentor Saionji. Konoe retained the military and legal ministers from the previous cabinet upon assumption of the premiership, and refused to take ministers from the political parties, as he was not interested in resurrecting party government. One month later, Japanese troops clashed with Chinese troops near Beijing in the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Nevertheless, a consensus emerged among Japanese military leadership that the nation was not ready for war with China, and a truce was made on 11 July. The ceasefire was broken by 20 July after Konoe&#x27;s government sent more divisions to China, causing full-scale war to erupt.

In November 1937, Konoe instituted a new system of joint conference between the civil government and the military called liaison conferences. In attendance at these liaison meetings were the prime minister, the foreign minister, the ministers of the army and navy, and their chiefs of general staff. This arrangement resulted in an imbalance in favor of the military, since each member in attendance had an equal say in policymaking.
Prior to the capture of Nanjing, Chang Kai-shek, through the German ambassador in China, attempted to negotiate, but Konoe rejected the overture.

After taking Nanjing, the Imperial Japanese Army was doubtful about its ability to advance up the Yangtze river valley, and favoured taking up a German offer of mediation to end the war with China. Konoe opposed immediate peace negotiations, and instead chose to escalate the war by suggesting deliberately humiliating terms that he knew Chiang Kai-shek would never accept in order to win a &quot;total victory&quot; over China.

In January 1938, Konoe issued a statement declaring that Kuomintang aggression had not ceased despite its defeat, that it was &quot;subjecting its people to great misery&quot;, and that Japan would no longer deal with Chiang. Six days later, he gave a speech where he blamed China for the continued conflict. When later asked for clarifications, Konoe said he meant more than just non-recognition of Chiang&#x27;s regime but &quot;rejected it&quot; and would &quot;eradicate it&quot;. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote about Konoe&#x27;s escalation of the war: &quot;The one time in the decade between 1931 and 1941 that the civilian authorities in Tokyo mustered the energy, courage and ingenuity to overrule the military on a major peace issue they did so with fatal results – fatal for Japan, fatal for China, and for Konoe himself.&quot;

Due to a trade imbalance, Japan had lost a large amount of its gold reserves by late 1937. Konoe believed that a new economic system geared toward exploitation of northern China&#x27;s resources was the only way to stop this economic deterioration. In response to continued U.S. support for the so-called Open Door Policy, Konoe rejected it &quot;as he had since Versailles, but left open possible western interests in southern China&quot;. In a declaration on 3 November 1938, Konoe said Japan sought a new order in east Asia, that Chiang no longer spoke for China, that Japan would reconstruct China without help from foreign powers, and that a &quot;tripartite relationship of ... Japan, Manchukuo, and China&quot; would &quot;create a new culture, and realize close economic cohesion throughout east Asia&quot;.

In April 1938, Konoe and the military pushed a State General Mobilization Law through the Diet, which declared a state of emergency, allowed the central government to control all manpower and material, and rationed the flow of raw materials into the Japanese market. Japanese victories continued at Xuzhou, Hankow, Canton, Wuchang, and Hanyang, but Chinese resistance nonetheless continued. Konoe resigned in January 1939, leaving the war that he had a large part in making to be finished by someone else, and was appointed chairman of the Privy Council. The Japanese public, which had been told that the war was an endless series of victories, was bewildered.

Kiichirō Hiranuma succeeded him as prime minister. Konoe was awarded the 1st class of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1939.

==Konoe&#x27;s second premiership, the Matsuoka foreign policy==
Due to dissatisfaction with the policies of Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai later that year, the Japanese Army demanded Konoe&#x27;s return. Yonai had refused to align Japan with the Nazis; in response, the army minister Shunroku Hata resigned and the army refused to nominate a replacement. Konoe was recalled after Saionji – for the last time before his death later that year – again endorsed him.

On 23 June, Konoe resigned his position as Chairman of the Privy Council, and on 16 July 1940, the Yonai Cabinet resigned and Konoe was appointed prime minister again. Konoe did set out to end the war in with China. But Konoe also deemed political parties as too liberal and divisive, thereby aiding the pro-war factions in the military. 

The Imperial Rule Assistance Association (IRAA) was created in 1940 under Second Konoe Cabinet as a wartime mobilization organization, ironically in alliance with local , since their cooperation was required to mobilize the rural population. Konoe&#x27;s government pressured political parties to dissolve into the IRAA, though he resisted calls to form a political party akin to the Nazi party, believing it would revive the political strife of the 1920s. Additionally, he worried that becoming the head of a political party would be beneath the dignity of a nobleman. Instead, he worked to promote the IRAA as the sole political order.

Even before Konoe had been recalled, the army had already planned an invasion of French Indochina. The invasion would secure needed resources to wage war with China, cut off western supply of Kuomintang armies, put the Japanese military in a strategic location to threaten more territory, and hopefully intimidate the Dutch East Indies into supplying Japan with oil. The U.S. responded with the Export Control Act and increased aid to Chiang. Despite this response, foreign minister Yosuke Matsuoka signed the Tripartite Pact on 27 September 1940, over the objection of some of Konoe&#x27;s advisors, including former Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Kikujiro Ishii. In a press conference on 4 October, Konoe said the U.S. should not misunderstand the intentions of the tripartite powers and should help them to build a new world order. Additionally he said that if the U.S. did not end its provocative actions and deliberately chose to misunderstand the actions of the tripartite powers, there would be no option left but war. In November 1940, Japan signed the Sino-Japanese treaty with Wang Jingwei, who had been a disciple of Sun Yat-sen and headed a rival Kuomintang government in Nanjing. But Konoe&#x27;s Government did not relinquish all held territory to Jinwei&#x27;s government, undercutting its authority, and Wang&#x27;s government was largely seen as an illegitimate puppet. In December 1940, the British reopened the Burma Road and lent £10 million to Chiang&#x27;s Kuomintang. Konoe recommenced negotiations with the Dutch in January 1941 in an attempt to secure an alternate source of oil.

In February 1941 Konoe chose Admiral Kichisaburō Nomura as Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Matsuoka and Stalin signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in Moscow on 13 April 1941, which made it clear that the Soviets would not help the Allies in the event of war with Japan. On 18 April 1941, word arrived from Nomura of a diplomatic breakthrough, a draft of understanding between the US and Japan. The basis of this agreement had been drafted by two American Maryknoll priests James Edward Walsh and James M. Drought, who had met Roosevelt through Postmaster General Frank C. Walker. The outline of the proposal, which had been drafted in consultation with banker Tadao Ikawa, Colonel Hideo Iwakura, and Nomura, included American recognition of Manchukuo, the merging of Chiang&#x27;s government with the Japanese-backed Reorganized National Government of China, normalization of trade relations, withdrawal of Japanese troops from China, mutual respect for Chinese independence, and an agreement that Japanese immigration to the United States would proceed on the basis of equality with other nationals free from discrimination.

When Matsuoka returned to Tokyo, a liaison conference was held, during which he voiced his opposition to the draft of understanding, believing it would betray their Nazi allies. After arguing that Japan should let Germany see this draft, he left the meeting, citing exhaustion, Konoe also retreated to his villa, also claiming a fever, instead of forcing the issue. Matsuoka pushed for an immediate attack on British Singapore and began to openly criticise Konoe and his cabinet, leading to suspicions that he wanted to replace Konoe as prime minister. Matsuoka changed the U.S. draft into a counteroffer that essentially gutted most of the Japanese concessions in regard to China and expansion in the Pacific and had Nomura deliver it to Washington.

On Sunday, 22 June 1941, Hitler broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact by invading the Soviet Union. Coincident with the invasion, Cordell Hull delivered another amendment of the draft on understanding to the Japanese, but this time there was no recognition of the Japanese right to control of Manchukuo. The new draft also completely rejected the Japanese right of military expansion in the Pacific. Hull included a statement that in summary said that as long as Japan was allied to Hitler an agreement would be next to impossible to achieve. He did not specifically mention Matsuoka, but it was implied that he would have to be removed, as the foreign minister was now advocating an immediate attack on the Soviet Union, and did so directly to the emperor. Konoe was forced to apologize to the emperor and assure him that Japan was not about to go to war with the Soviet Union. Masanobu Tsuji had planned to assassinate Konoe if peace had occurred with the United States in order for Japan to attack the Soviet Union, which was at war with Japan&#x27;s ally Germany.

Matsuoka was convinced that Operation Barbarossa would be a quick German victory, and he was now opposed to attacking Singapore because he believed it would provoke war with the western allies. After a series of liaison conferences where Matsuoka argued forcefully in favour of an attack against the Soviet Union and against further expansion southward, the decision was made to invade and occupy the southern half of French Indochina, which was formalized in an imperial conference on 2 July. Included in this imperial conference resolution was a statement that Japan would not flinch from war with the U.S. and Britain if necessary. Beginning on 10 July, Konoe held a series of liaison conferences to discuss the Japanese response to Hull&#x27;s latest amendment to the draft of understanding. It was decided that a reply would not be given until the Japanese takeover of southern Indochina was complete, hoping that if it went peacefully, perhaps the U.S. could be convinced to tolerate the occupation without intervention. On 14 July, Matsuoka drafted a response – through illness – which said Japan would not abandon the tripartite pact. He attacked Hull&#x27;s statement, which had been aimed largely at him, and the next day he sent the response to Germany for approval. Sending the draft to the Germans without the cabinet&#x27;s permission was the final straw. Konoe and his cabinet resigned en masse and reformed the government without Matsuoka on 16 July, when Matsuoka did not attend due to illness.

== Third government and attempt to avoid war with the United States ==

The Third Konoe Cabinet was formally created on 18 July 1941, with admiral Teijirō Toyoda as foreign minister. The Franklin D. Roosevelt administration hoped that Matsuoka&#x27;s dismissal would mean Japan was standing down from continued aggressive action; these hopes were dashed when the French government, after being threatened with military action, allowed the Japanese army to occupy all of French Indochina on 22 July. Two days later, the U.S. cut off negotiations and froze Japanese assets, the British, Dutch, and Canadian governments following suit shortly thereafter. The same day Roosevelt met with Nomura, where he told the ambassador that if Japan would agree to pull out of Indochina and agree to its being granted a status of neutrality, Japanese assets could be unfrozen. Roosevelt implied that Japanese expansion in China would be tolerated, but Indochina was a red line. He expressed how disturbed he was that Japan could not see that Hitler was bent on world domination. Konoe did not take aggressive action in implementing Roosevelt&#x27;s offer, and could not restrain militarists, led by Hideki Tojo. As minister of war, Tojo regarded the seizure as irreversible due to its approval by the emperor.

On 28 July, the Japanese began to formally occupy southern Indochina. In response, on 1 August, the U.S. embargoed oil exports to Japan, surprising Konoe&#x27;s cabinet. Finding a replacement source of petroleum was paramount, as the U.S. supplied 93% of Japan&#x27;s oil in 1940. Navy chief of staff Osami Nagano informed Emperor Hirohito that Japan&#x27;s oil stockpiles would be completely depleted in two years. The same day, Hachirō Arita wrote Konoe a letter telling him that he should not have let the military occupy southern Indochina while negotiations with the U.S. were still ongoing. Konoe responded that the ships were already dispatched and could not turn back in time, and that all he could do was pray for &quot;divine intervention&quot;.

On 6 August, Konoe&#x27;s government announced that it would only pull out of Indochina when the war in China was concluded, rejected Roosevelt&#x27;s neutralization proposal, but promised not to expand further and asked for US mediation in ending the war in China. On 8 August, Konoe requested, through Nomura, a meeting with Roosevelt. The suggestion came from Kinkazu Saionji, the grandson of his deceased mentor Saionji Kinmochi. Kinkazu advised Konoe through a monthly informal breakfast club, where Konoe consulted with civilian elites about policy. Hotsumi Ozaki, who was a friend and advisor to Konoe, was a member of this same breakfast club; he was also a member of Richard Sorge&#x27;s Soviet spy ring.

Nomura met with Roosevelt and told him about Konoe&#x27;s summit proposal. After condemning Japanese aggression in Indochina, Roosevelt said he was open to the meeting, and suggested they could meet in Juneau, Alaska. On 3 September, a liaison conference was held where it was decided that Konoe would continue to seek peace with Roosevelt, but, at the same time, Japan would commit to war if a peace agreement did not materialize by mid-October. Moreover, Japan would not abandon the tripartite pact. Konoe, Saionji, and his supporters had drafted a proposal that emphasized a willingness to withdraw troops from China, but Konoe did not introduce this proposal and instead acceded to a proposal from the foreign ministry. The difference in the proposals was that the foreign ministry&#x27;s was conditioned on an agreement being reached between China and Japan before troops would be withdrawn.

On 5 September, Konoe met the emperor with chiefs of staff General Hajime Sugiyama and Admiral Osami Nagano to inform him of the cabinet&#x27;s decision to commit to war in the absence of a diplomatic breakthrough. Alarmed, the emperor asked what had happened to the negotiations with Roosevelt. He asked Konoe to change the emphasis from war to negotiation; Konoe replied that would be politically impossible, and the emperor then asked why he had been kept in the dark about these military preparations. The emperor then questioned Sugiyama about the chances of success of an open war with the West. After Sugiyama answered positively, Hirohito scolded him, remembering that the Army had predicted that the invasion of China would be completed in only three months.

On 6 September, the Emperor approved the cabinet&#x27;s decision at an imperial conference after being given assurance by the two chiefs of staff that diplomacy was the primary emphasis, with war only as a fall-back option in the event of diplomatic failure. That same evening, Konoe arranged a dinner in secrecy with U.S. ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew. (This was somewhat perilous: on 15 August, Hiranuma Kiichiro, a member of Konoe&#x27;s cabinet and former prime minister, had been shot six times by an ultra-nationalist because he was seen as too close to Grew.) Konoe told Grew that he was prepared to travel to meet Roosevelt on a moment&#x27;s notice. Grew then urged his superiors to advise Roosevelt to accept the summit proposal.

The day after the imperial conference, Konoe arranged a meeting between Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni and army minister Tojo, which was an attempt to bring the war hawk in line with Konoe. Higashikuni told Tojo that since the Emperor and Konoe favoured negotiation over war, the army minister should too, and that he should quit if he could not follow a policy of non-confrontation. Tojo replied that if the western encirclement of Japan were to be accepted, Japan would cease to exist. Tojo believed that even if there was only a small chance of winning a war with the U.S., Japan must prepare for it and wage it rather than be encircled and destroyed.
On 10 September, Nomura met with Hull, who told him that the latest Japanese offer was a non-starter and that Japan would have to make concessions in regard to China before the summit meeting could take place. On 20 September, a liaison meeting passed a revised proposal that actually &quot;hardened&quot; conditions for a withdrawal from China. At the liaison conference of 25 September, sensing that summit negotiations were stalling, Tojo and the militarists pressed the cabinet to commit to an actual deadline for war of 15 October. After this meeting, Konoe told lord keeper of the privy seal Kōichi Kido that he was going to resign, but Kido talked him out of it. Konoe then secluded himself in a villa at Kamakura until 2 October, leaving foreign minister Toyoda to take charge of negotiations in his absence. Toyoda asked ambassador Grew to tell Roosevelt that Konoe would only be able to grant concessions at the summit but could not commit beforehand due to the influence of the militarists and the risk that any conciliation beforehand would be leaked to the Germans in an effort to bring down the Konoe cabinet. Grew argued in favour of the summit to Roosevelt in a communication on 29 September.

On 1 October, Konoe summoned navy minister Koshirō Oikawa to Kamakura, where he secured his commitment of cooperation in acceptance American demands, the navy being acutely aware of the long odds of victory in the event of war with the U.S. Oikawa returned to Tokyo and seemed to secure the cooperation of navy chief of staff Nagano, including Toyoda as foreign minister they formed a potential majority in the next liaison conference. On 2 October, Hull delivered to Nomura a statement constituting the preconditions for a summit meeting. Hull made it clear that the Japanese army would have to demonstrate that they were going to pull troops out of French Indochina and China.

At the 4 October liaison conference, Hull&#x27;s response was still being processed and could not be fully discussed; Nagano changed his position and now agreed with the army and advocated a deadline for war. Konoe and Oikawa were largely silent and did not try to bring him back to the side of negotiation, further postponing a final decision. The army and the navy were in opposition to each other and held separate high-level meetings, each respectively confirming their resolve to either go to war or pull back from the brink. But Nagano continued to oppose open confrontation of the army, while Oikawa did not want to take the lead as the only member of the liaison conference to oppose war.

Konoe met privately with Tojo twice in a failed attempt to convince him to a troop withdrawal and to take the war option off the table on 5 and 7 October. In the 7 October meeting, Konoe told Tojo that &quot;military men take wars too lightly&quot;. Tojo&#x27;s response was, &quot;occasionally one must gather up enough courage, close one&#x27;s eyes and jump off the platform of the Kiyomizu.&quot; Konoe responded that, while such a policy was okay for the individual, &quot;if I think of the national polity that has lasted twenty six hundred years and of the hundred million Japanese belonging to this nation, I, as a person in the position of great responsibility, cannot do such a thing.&quot; The next day Tojo met with Oikawa and showed some doubt when he told him that it would be a betrayal of those who had already died in the war for the army to pull troops out of China, but that he was also worried about the many more who would die in an eventual war with the U.S., and that he was considering a troop withdrawal.

Konoe held a meeting on 12 October with military ministers Tojo and Oikawa and foreign minister Toyoda, which became known as the Tekigaiso conference. Konoe began by saying that he had no confidence in the war they were about to wage and would not lead it, but neither Oikawa or Konoe was willing to take the lead in demanding that the army agree to taking the war option off the table. Toyoda was the only member willing to declare that the imperial conference of 6 September was a mistake, implying that the war option should be taken off the table, while Tojo forcefully argued that an imperial resolution could not be violated.

On 14 October, one day before the deadline, Konoe and Tojo met one last time, where Konoe attempted to impress upon Tojo the need to stand down from war and accede to U.S. demands for a military withdrawal from China and Indochina. Tojo ruled a troop withdrawal as out of the question. In the cabinet meeting that followed, Tojo declared that the decision of the imperial conference had been thoroughly deliberated, that hundreds of thousands of troops were being moved south as they spoke, that if diplomacy were to continue they must be sure that it would result in success, and that the imperial edict had specifically declared that negotiations must bear fruit by early October (which meant the deadline had already been passed). After this conference Tojo went to see lord keeper of the privy seal Kido, to push for Konoe&#x27;s resignation.

That same evening Tojo sent Teiichi Suzuki (at that time the head of the cabinet planning board) to Konoe with a message urging him to resign, stating that if he resigned Tojo would endorse prince Higashikuni as the next prime minister. Suzuki told Konoe that Tojo realized now that the navy was unwilling to admit that it could not fight the U.S. He also told Konoe that Tojo believed the current cabinet must resign and bear the responsibility of wrongfully calling for the imperial edict, and only someone of Higashikuni&#x27;s imperial background could reverse it. The next day, on 15 October, Konoe&#x27;s friend and advisor Hotsumi Ozaki was exposed and arrested as a Soviet spy.

Konoe resigned on 16 October 1941, one day after having recommended Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni to the Emperor as his successor. Two days later, Hirohito appointed war minister, General Hideki Tojo as the next prime minister by following Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kōichi Kido&#x27;s advice. In 1946, Hirohito explained this decision: &quot;I actually thought Prince Higashikuni suitable as chief of staff of the Army; but I think the appointment of a member of the imperial house to a political office must be considered very carefully. Above all, in time of peace this is fine, but when there is a fear that there may even be a war, then more importantly, considering the welfare of the imperial house, I wonder about the wisdom of a member of the imperial family serving [as prime minister].&quot; Six weeks later, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.

Konoe justified his demission to his secretary Kenji Tomita. &quot;Of course His Imperial Majesty is a pacifist and he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: &#x27;You were worried about it yesterday but you do not have to worry so much.&#x27; Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: &#x27;My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.&#x27; In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands.&quot;

==Post premiership, final years of the war and suicide==
On 29 November 1941, at a luncheon with the Emperor with all living former prime ministers in attendance, Konoe voiced his objection to war. Upon hearing of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Konoe said regarding Japan&#x27;s military success, &quot;What on earth? I really feel a miserable defeat coming; this will only last 2 or 3 months.&quot;

Konoe played a role in the fall of the Tōjō Cabinet in 1944 following the defeat in the Battle of Saipan. In February 1945, during the first private audience he had been allowed in three years, he advised the Emperor to begin negotiations to end World War II. According to Grand Chamberlain Hisanori Fujita, Shōwa, still looking for a (a great victory), firmly rejected Konoe&#x27;s recommendation.

On 14 February 1945, Konoe wrote a report to Hirohito titled &quot;The Konoe Memorial&quot; which called for Hirohito to surrender to the Allies to prevent a &quot;communist revolution&quot; in Japan. Citing the threat of &quot;communist agitators&quot; such as Okano (alias of Japanese Communist Party leader Sanzō Nosaka), Soviet expansionism, and Pro-Soviet elements within the government.

After the beginning of the Allied occupation according to the surrender of Japan, Konoe served in the cabinet of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, the first post-war government. He came under suspicion of war crimes after he refused to collaborate with U.S. Army officer Bonner Fellers in &quot;Operation Blacklist&quot;, which aimed to exonerate Emperor Hirohito and the imperial family of criminal responsibility for the war. 
Konoe preferred death to the humiliation of a war crimes trial. The night before he was to leave to Sugamo prison on 15 December 1945, his son Michitaka searched his room for weapons and poison. Konoe and his son talked at length that night about the invasion of China, negotiations with the US, and the heavy responsibility he felt toward the emperor and the Japanese people. Fumimaro recorded his feelings about these issues in pencil at the urging of his son. According to Michitaka, he apologized to his father for his failure to be a filial son, sensing that these may be their last moments together. His father rebuffed him, replying &quot;What does &#x27;to be filial&#x27; mean?&quot;, then turned away. They sat in silence until Michitaka told his father to go to sleep and asked him if he was going to leave tomorrow. Fumimaro didn&#x27;t reply but Michitaka gazed at him. Fumimaro gazed back and Michitaka had never seen such a strange and distasteful expression on his father&#x27;s face. For the first time he perceived the older man&#x27;s intention to die. Just before dawn, Michitaka was awakened by his mother&#x27;s excited voice, when he entered his father&#x27;s room Fumimaro was stretched out, looking calm and serene, as if asleep. A brownish bottle, empty, lay beside his pillow. He had died by suicide by taking potassium cyanide. His grave is at the Konoe clan cemetery at the temple of Daitoku-ji in Kyoto.

His grandson, Morihiro Hosokawa, became prime minister fifty years later, on 9 August 1993.

<text>A kowtow () is the act of deep respect shown by prostration, that is, kneeling and bowing so low as to have one&#x27;s head touching the ground. In Sinospheric culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one&#x27;s elders, superiors, and especially the Emperor of China, as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has been reduced.

==Terminology==
The word Kowtow is derived from / (). An alternative Chinese term is / (); however, the meaning is somewhat altered: has the general meaning of &quot;knock&quot;, whereas has the general meaning of &quot;touch upon (a surface)&quot;, / meaning head. The date of this custom&#x27;s origin is probably sometime during the Spring and Autumn period or the Warring States period of China&#x27;s history (771–221 BC), because it was a custom by the time of the Qin dynasty (221 BC – 206 BC).

==Traditional usage==

In Imperial Chinese protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the situation&#x27;s solemnity, different kowtow grades would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example, at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor&#x27;s subjects would undertake the ceremony of the &quot;three kneelings and nine kowtows&quot;, the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. Immanuel Hsu describes the &quot;full kowtow&quot; as &quot;three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground&quot;.

As government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate must kneel and kowtow. A commoner was required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who had earned a degree in the Imperial examinations was permitted a seat.

Since one is required by Confucian philosophy to show great reverence to one&#x27;s parents and grandparents, children may be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.

Confucius believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind. Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.

==Modern Chinese usage==

The kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the May Fourth Movement. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing bow has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.

The kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, Chinese martial arts schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Traditional performing arts often require the kowtow.

==Religion==
Prostration is a general practice in Buddhism, and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either &quot;worship with the crown (of the head)&quot; (頂禮 ding li) or &quot;casting the five limbs to the earth&quot; (五體投地 wuti tou di)—referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows—stand up and kneel down again between each set—as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term &quot;three kneelings and nine head knockings&quot; (). 

Some Buddhist pilgrims would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the Triple Gem of Buddhism, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. Prostration is widely practiced in India by Hindus to give utmost respect to their deities in temples and to parents and elders. In modern times, people show regards to elders by bowing down and touching their feet. Prostration is also common among the Yoruba people in West Africa. Parents raised their male children to prostrate as a sign of respect and indication of good home training while the female children are trained to kneel to elders when greeting. Due to modernisation of some sort, it is not uncommon to see boys or men slightly bow their head to an older person rather than having to fully prostrate. Similarly, girls and women now slightly tilt their knees as a sign of respect, rather than having to fully kneel down all the time.

== Diplomacy ==
The word &quot;kowtow&quot; came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling. The term is still commonly used in English with this meaning, disconnected from the physical act and the East Asian context.

Dutch ambassador Isaac Titsingh did not refuse to kowtow during the course of his 1794–1795 mission to the imperial court of the Qianlong Emperor. The members of the Titsingh mission, including Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest and Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes, made every effort to conform with the demands of the complex Imperial court etiquette.

The Qing courts gave bitter feedback to the Afghan emir Ahmad Shah when its Afghan envoy, presenting four splendid horses to Qianlong in 1763, refused to perform the kowtow. Coming amid tense relations between the Qing and Durrani empires, Chinese officials forbade the Afghans from sending envoys to Beijing in the future.

On two occasions, the kowtow was performed by Chinese envoys to a foreign ruler – specifically the Russian Tsar. T&#x27;o-Shih, Qing emissary to Russia whose mission to Moscow took place in 1731, kowtowed before Tsarina Anna, as per instructions by the Yongzheng Emperor, as did Desin, who led another mission the next year to the new Russian capital at St. Petersburg. Hsu notes that the Kangxi Emperor, Yongzheng&#x27;s predecessor, explicitly ordered that Russia be given a special status in Qing foreign relations by not being included among tributary states, i.e. recognition as an implicit equal of China.

The kowtow was often performed in intra-Asian diplomatic relations as well. In 1636, after being defeated by the invading Manchus, King Injo of Joseon (Korea) was forced to surrender by kowtowing three times to pledge tributary status to the Qing Emperor, Hong Taiji. As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896, when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War.

The King of the Ryukyu Kingdom also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground (), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.

<text>Kamchatka Oblast () was, until being incorporated into Kamchatka Krai on July 1, 2007, a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). To the north, it bordered Magadan Oblast and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. Koryak Okrug was located in the northern part of the oblast. Including the autonomous okrug, the total area of the oblast was , encompassing the southern half of the Kamchatka Peninsula. The administrative center of Kamchatka Oblast was the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Population: 

Kamchatka&#x27;s natural resources include coal, gold, mica, pyrites, and natural gas. Most of the inhabitants live in the administrative center, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The main employment sectors are fishing, forestry, tourism (a growing industry), and the Russian military. There is still a large military presence on the peninsula; the home base of Russia&#x27;s Pacific submarine fleet is across Avacha Bay from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at the Rybachy base. There are also several air force bases and radar sites in Kamchatka.

As of the 2002 All-Russian Population Census, the majority of the 358,801 population is Russian (290,108), largest minorities are Ukrainian (20,870) and Koryak (7,328). The northern part of the peninsula is occupied by Koryak Autonomous Okrug, where around 6,700 Koryaks live. A small number of Evens also live here.

The oblast was established on October 20, 1932, subordinated to the Far Eastern Krai (later Khabarovsk Krai). In 1956, it became a separate oblast under its own jurisdiction.

<text>Kołobrzeg (; ; ) is a port and spa city in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in north-western Poland with about 47,000 inhabitants (). Kołobrzeg is located on the Parsęta River on the south coast of the Baltic Sea (in the middle of the section divided by the Oder and Vistula Rivers). It is the capital of Kołobrzeg County.

During the Early Middle Ages, the Pomeranian tribes established a settlement at the site of modern-day Budzistowo. In 1000, when the city was part of Poland, it became the seat of the Diocese of Kołobrzeg, one of five oldest Polish dioceses. During the High Middle Ages, the town was expanded with an additional settlement inhabited by German settlers a few kilometers north of the stronghold and chartered with Lübeck law, which settlement eventually superseded the original Pomeranian settlement. The city later joined the Hanseatic League. Within the Duchy of Pomerania the town was the urban center of the secular reign of the prince-bishops of Kamień and their residence throughout the High and Late Middle Ages. In the modern age, it passed to Brandenburg and Prussia, and withstood a Polish-French siege in 1807. In the late 19th century it became a popular spa town at the Baltic Sea. In 1945, Polish and Soviet troops captured the town. Kołobrzeg, now part of post-war Poland and devastated in the preceding battle, was rebuilt, but lost its status as the regional center to the nearby city of Koszalin.

==Etymology==
&quot;Kołobrzeg&quot; means &quot;by the shore&quot; in Polish; &quot;koło&quot; translates as &quot;by&quot; and &quot;brzeg&quot; means &quot;coast&quot; or &quot;shore&quot;. has a similar etymology. The original name of Cholberg was taken by Polish and Kashubian linguists in the 19th and 20th centuries to reconstruct the name. After German settlement, the original name of &quot;Cholberg&quot; evolved into ().

== History ==

=== Pomeranian stronghold at modern Budzistowo ===

According to Piskorski (1999) and Kempke (2001), Slavic and Lechitic immigration reached Farther Pomerania in the 7th century. First Slavic settlements in the vicinity of Kołobrzeg were centered around nearby deposits of salt and date to 6th and 7th century.

In the late 9th century, the Pomeranian tribes erected a fortified settlement at the site of modern part of Kołobrzeg county called Budzistowo near modern Kołobrzeg, replacing nearby Bardy-Świelubie, a multi-ethnic emporium, as the center of the region. The Parseta valley, where both the emporium and the stronghold were located, was one of the Pomeranians&#x27; core settlement areas. The stronghold consisted of a fortified burgh with a suburbium.

The Pomeranians mined salt in salt pans located in two downstream hills. They also engaged in fishing, and used the salt to conserve foodstuffs, primarily herring, for trade. Other important occupations were metallurgy and smithery, based on local iron ore reserves, other crafts like the production of combs from horn, and in the surrounding areas, agriculture. Important sites in the settlement were a place for periodical markets and a tavern, mentioned as &quot;forum et taberna&quot; in 1140.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Budzistowo stronghold was the largest of several smaller ones in the Persante area, and as such is thought to have functioned as the center of the local Pomeranian subtribe. By the turn from the 10th to the 11th century, the smaller burghs in the Parseta area were given up. With the area coming under the control of the Polish Duke Mieszko I, only two strongholds remained and underwent an enlargement, the one at Budzistowo and a predecessor of later Białogard. These developments were most likely associated with the establishment of Polish power over this part of the Baltic coast. In the 10th century, the trade of salt and fish led to the development of the settlement into a town.

=== Piast Poland and conversion ===
During Polish rule of the area in the late 10th century, the chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg (975–1018) mentions &quot;salsa Cholbergiensis&quot; as the see of the Bishopric of Kołobrzeg, set up during the Congress of Gniezno in 1000 and placed under the Archdiocese of Gniezno. The congress was organized by Polish duke Bolesław Chrobry and Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, and also led to the establishment of bishoprics in Kraków and Wrocław, connecting the territories of the Polish state. It was an important event not only in religious, but also political dimension in the history of the early Polish state, as it unified and organized medieval Polish territories.

The missionary efforts of bishop Reinbern were not successful, the Pomeranians revolted in 1005 and regained political and spiritual independence. In 1013 Bolesław Chrobry removed his troops from Pomerania in face of war with Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. The Polish–German war ended with Polish victory, which was confirmed by the 1018 Peace of Bautzen.

During his campaigns in the early 12th century, Bolesław III Wrymouth reacquired Pomerania for Poland, and made the local Griffin dynasty his vassals. The stronghold was captured by the Polish army in the winter of 1107/08, when the inhabitants (&quot;cives et oppidani&quot;) including a duke (&quot;dux Pomeranorum&quot;) surrendered without resistance. A previous Polish siege of the burgh had been unsuccessful; although the duke had fled the burgh, the Polish army was unable to break through the fortifications and the two gates. The army had however looted and burned the suburbium, which was not or only lightly fortified. The descriptions given by the contemporary chroniclers make it possible that a second, purely militarily used castle existed near the settlement, yet neither is this certain nor have archaeological efforts been able to locate traces thereof. In the 12th-century Polish chronicle &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; Kołobrzeg was named a significant and &quot;famous city&quot;.

During the subsequent Christianization of the area by Otto of Bamberg at the behest of Bolesław, a St. Mary&#x27;s church was built. This marked the first beginnings of German influence in the area. After Bolesław&#x27;s death, as a result of the fragmentation of Poland, the Duchy of Pomerania became independent, before the dukes became vassals of Denmark in 1185 and the Holy Roman Empire in 1227.

Besides St. Mary&#x27;s, a St. John&#x27;s church and a St. Petri&#x27;s chapel were built.
A painting of the town of Kołobrzeg from the 13th century is located in the Museum of Polish Arms in the city.

=== From the late Middle Ages to the Thirty Years&#x27; War ===
During the Ostsiedlung, a settlement was founded by German settlers some kilometres off the site of the Slavic/Lechitic one. It was located within the boundaries of today&#x27;s downtown of Kołobrzeg and some of the inhabitants of the Polish town moved to the new settlement. On 23 May 1255 it was chartered under Lübeck law by Duke Wartislaw III of Pomerania, and more settlers arrived, attracted by the duke. Hermann von Gleichen, German bishop of Kammin also supported the German colonisation of the region. The settlers received several privileges such as exemption from certain taxes and several benefits, making it difficult for the indigenous Pomeranian population to compete with Germans.

Henceforth, the nearby former stronghold was turned into a village and renamed &quot;Old Town&quot; (, , ), first documented in 1277 and used until 1945 when it was renamed &quot;Budzistowo&quot;. A new St. Mary&#x27;s church was built within the new town before the 1260s, while St. Mary&#x27;s in the former Pomeranian stronghold was turned into a nuns&#x27; abbey. In 1277 St. Benedict&#x27;s monastery for nuns was founded, which in the framework of the Pomeranian Reformation in 1545 was then changed into an educational institution for noble Protestant ladies.

Already in 1248, the Kammin bishops and the Pomeranian dukes had interchanged the &quot;terrae&quot; Stargard and Kolberg, leaving the bishops in charge of the latter. When in 1276 they became the souvereign of the town also, they moved their residence there, while the administration of the diocese was done from nearby Köslin (Koszalin). In 1345, the bishops became Imperial immediate dukes in their secular reign.

In 1361, the city joined the Hanseatic League. In 1446 it fought a battle against the nearby rival city of Koszalin.

When the property of the Bishopric of Kammin was secularized during the Protestant Reformation in 1534, their secular reign including the Kolberg area became intermediately ruled by a Lutheran titular bishop, before it was turned into a &quot;Sekundogenitur&quot; of the House of Pomerania.

In the 15th century the city traded with Scotland, Amsterdam and Scandinavia. Beer, salt, honey, wool and flour were exported, while merchants imported textiles from England, southern fruits, and cod liver oil. In the 16th century, the city reached 5,000 inhabitants. The indigenous Slavs in the city were discriminated, and their rights in trade and crafts were limited, with bans on performing certain types of professions and taking certain positions in the city, for instance in 1564 it was forbidden to admit native Slavs to the blacksmiths&#x27; guild.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Kolberg was occupied by imperial forces from 1627 to 1630, and thereafter by Swedish forces.

===Modern era: In Prussia===
Kolberg, with most of Farther Pomerania, was granted to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1648 by the Treaty of Westphalia and, after the signing of the Treaty of Stettin (1653), and in accordance with the Treaty of Grimnitz, was part of the Province of Pomerania. It became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. In the 18th century, trade with Poland declined, while the production of textiles was developed. In 1761, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the town was captured after three subsequent sieges by the Russian commander Peter Rumyantsev. At the end of the war, however, Kolberg was returned to Prussia.

During Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Prussia during the War of the Fourth Coalition, the town was besieged from mid-March to 2 July 1807 by the Grande Armée and by insurgents from Poland against Prussian rule (a street named after General Antoni Paweł Sułkowski, who led Polish them, is located within the present-day city). As a result of forced conscription, some Poles were also among Prussian soldiers during the battle. The city&#x27;s defense, led by then Lieutenant-Colonel August von Gneisenau, held out until the war was ended by the Treaty of Tilsit. Kolberg was returned to the Prussian province of Pomerania in 1815, after the final defeat of Napoleon; until 1872, it was administered within the Fürstenthum District (&quot;Principality District&quot;, recalling the area&#x27;s former special status), then it was within Landkreis Kolberg-Körlin.
Marcin Dunin, Archbishop of Poznań and Gniezno and Roman Catholic primate of Poland, was imprisoned for sedition by the Prussian authorities for ten months in 1839–1840 in the city and after his release, he tried to organise a chaplaincy for the many Polish soldiers stationed in Kolberg.

In the 19th century the city had a small but active Polish population that increased during the century to account for 1.5% of the population by 1905. The Polish community funded a Catholic school and the Church of Saint Marcin where masses in Polish were held (initially throughout the season, after about 1890 all the year), were established. Dating back to 1261 Kolberg&#x27;s Jewish population amounted to 528 people in 1887, rising to 580 two years later, and although many moved to Berlin after that date they numbered around 500 by the end of the Nineteenth century

Between 1924 and 1935, the American-German painter Lyonel Feininger, a tutor at the Staatliches Bauhaus, visited Kolberg repeatedly and painted the cathedral and environs of the town.

In the May elections of 1933, the Nazi Party received by far the most votes, 9,842 out of 19,607 cast votes.
When the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, the Jewish community in Kolberg comprised 200 people, and the antisemitic repression by Germany&#x27;s ruling party led several of them to flee the country. A Nazi newspaper, the &quot;Kolberger Beobachter&quot;, listed Jewish shops and business that were to be boycotted. Nazis also engaged in hate propaganda against Jewish lawyers, doctors, and craftsmen. At the end of 1935, Jews were banned from working in the city&#x27;s health spas. During Kristallnacht, the Jewish synagogue and homes were destroyed, and in 1938 the local Jewish cemetery was vandalised, while a cemetery shrine was turned to stable by German soldiers. In 1938, all Jews in Kolberg, as all over Germany, were renamed in official German documents as &quot;Israel&quot; (for males) or &quot;Sarah&quot; (for females). In the beginning of 1939, Jews were banned from attending German schools and the entire adult population had its driving licenses revoked. After years of discrimination and harassment, local Jews were deported by the German authorities to concentration camps in 1940.

===Second World War===

During the World War II the German state brought in numerous forced laborers to the city, among them many Poles. The city&#x27;s economy was changed to military production-especially after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The forced laborers were threatened with everyday harassment and repression; they were forbidden from using phones, holding cultural events and sports events, they could not visit restaurants or swimming pools, or have contact with the local German population. Poles were only allowed to attend a church mass once a month – and only in the German language. They also had smaller food rations than Germans, and had to wear a sign with the letter P on their clothes indicating their ethnic background. Additionally, medical help for Polish workers was limited by the authorities. Arrests and imprisonment for various offences, such as &quot;slow pace of work&quot; or leaving the workspace, were everyday occurrences. A labour subcamp of the Stalag II-D prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs was also operated in the city by Germany.

In 1944, the city was selected as a fortress — &quot;Festung Kolberg&quot;. The 1807 siege was used for the last Nazi propaganda film, &quot;Kolberg&quot; shortly before the end of the war by Joseph Goebbels. It was meant to inspire the Germans with its depiction of the heroic Prussian defence during the Napoleonic Wars. Tremendous resources were devoted to filming this epic, even diverting tens of thousands of troops from the front lines to have them serve as extras in battle scenes. Ironically, the film was released in the final few weeks of Nazi Germany&#x27;s existence, when most of the country&#x27;s cinemas were already destroyed.

On 10 February 1945, the German torpedo-boat T-196 brought about 300 survivors of the , which had been sunk by Soviet submarine S-13 to Kolberg. As the Red Army advanced on Kolberg, most of the inhabitants and tens of thousands of refugees from surrounding areas (about 70,000 were trapped in the Kolberg Pocket), as well as 40,000 German soldiers, were evacuated from the besieged city by German naval forces in Operation Hannibal. Only about two thousand soldiers were left on 17 March to cover the last sea transports.

Between 4 and 18 March 1945, there were major battles between the Soviet and Polish forces and the German army. Because of a lack of anti-tank weapons, German destroyers used their guns to support the defenders of Kolberg until nearly all of the soldiers and civilians had been evacuated. During the fights, Polish soldiers&#x27; losses were 1,013 dead, 142 MIA and 2,652 wounded. On 18 March, the Polish Army re-enacted &quot;Poland&#x27;s Wedding to the Sea&quot; ceremony, which had been celebrated for the first time in 1920 by General Józef Haller.

After the battle the city for several weeks was under Soviet administration, the Germans that had not yet fled were expelled and the city was plundered by the Soviet troops. Freed Polish forced laborers remained and were joined by Polish railwaymen from Warsaw destroyed by the Germans.
===Post-war Poland===

After World War II the region became again part of Poland, under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union and the Soviet-installed Polish Communist regime at the Potsdam Conference. Most Germans that had not yet fled were expelled from their homes in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town was resettled by Polish citizens, many of whom were themselves Polish refugees from regions east of former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, from where they had been displaced by Soviet authorities.

In 2000 the city business council of Kołobrzeg commissioned a monument called the Millennium Memorial as a commemoration of &quot;1000 years of Christianity in Pomerania&quot;, and as a tribute to Polish-German Reconciliation, celebrating the meeting of King Bolesław I of Poland and King Otto III of Germany, at the Congress of Gniezno, in the year 1000. It was designed and built by the artist Wiktor Szostalo in welded stainless steel. The two figures sit at the base of a 5-meter cross, cleft in two and being held together by a dove holding an olive branch. It is installed outside the Basilica Cathedral in the city center.

==Climate==
Kołobrzeg has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;).
==Demographics==

Before the end of World War II the town was predominantly German Protestant with Polish and Jewish minorities. Almost all of the pre-war German population fled or was expelled so that since 1945, Polish Catholics make up the majority of the population. Around the turn from the 18th to the 19th century an increase of the number of Catholics was observed, because military personnel had been moved from West Prussia to the town.


== Tourist destination ==
Kołobrzeg today is a popular tourist destination for Poles, Germans and due to the ferry connection to Bornholm also Danish people.

<text>The Konix Multisystem was a cancelled video game system under development by Konix, a British manufacturer of computer peripherals.

==Background==
The Konix Multisystem began life in 1988 as an advanced Konix peripheral design intended to build on the success of the company&#x27;s range of joysticks. The design, codenamed Slipstream, resembled a dashboard-style games controller, and could be configured with a steering wheel, a flight yoke, and motorbike handles. It promised advanced features such as force feedback, hitherto unheard of in home gaming.

However, it soon became apparent that the Slipstream project had the potential to be much more than a peripheral. Konix turned to their sister company Creative Devices Ltd, a computer hardware developer, to design a gaming computer to be put inside the controller to make it a stand-alone console in its own right. It was shortly after this development began that Konix founder and chairman Wyn Holloway came across a magazine article that described the work of a British group of computer hardware designers whose latest design was looking for a home.

The article in question, published in issue 10 of &quot;ACE&quot; magazine in July 1988, featured Flare Technology, a group of computer hardware designers who, having split from Sinclair Research (creators of the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum home computers), had built on their work on Sinclair&#x27;s aborted Loki project to create a system known as Flare One.

Flare&#x27;s prototype system was Z80 based but featured four custom chips to give it the power to compete with peers such as the Amiga and Atari ST. The 1MB machine (128k of ROM, 128k of video RAM, 768k of system RAM) promised graphics with 256 colours on-screen simultaneously, could handle 3 million pixels per second, output 8 channel stereo sound and had a blitter chip that allowed vertical and horizontal hardware scrolling.

Flare were specifically aiming their machine at the gaming market, eschewing such features as 80 column text display (considered the requisite for business applications such as word processing) in favour of faster graphics handling. This meant that in spite of its modest 8-bit CPU the system compared well against the 16-bit machines in the market at the time. It could move sprites and block graphics faster than an Atari ST, and in 256 colours under conditions when the ST would only show 16 colours. It could also draw lines 3 times faster than an Amiga and even handle the maths of 3D models faster than the 32-bit Acorn Archimedes.

In spite of these specifications and bearing in mind their target gaming market, Flare aimed to retail their machine for around , half of what the Amiga and ST were selling for. Ultimately, Flare&#x27;s resources to put it into mass production were limited.

==Development==

Holloway approached Flare and proposed a merger of their respective technologies to create an innovative new kind of gaming console with the computer hardware built into the main controller and in July 1988 a partnership was formed. Development work was carried out by Flare, with assistance from British games programmer Jeff Minter.

Konix wanted the machine to use a 16-bit processor, so the Z80 was removed and replaced with an 8086 processor. They also demanded that the colour palette be expanded to 4096 colours, the same as that of the Amiga. To reduce manufacturing costs, the Flare One&#x27;s four custom chips were integrated into one large chip. In order to keep the cost of software down, it was decided that the software media would be 3.5” floppy discs rather than ROM cartridges used universally by consoles up to that time.

The embryonic console was revealed to the computing press at a toy fair held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in February 1989. It boasted market leading performance, MIDI support and revolutionary peripherals including a light gun with recoil action and the Power Chair, a motorised seat designed to reproduce in the home what &quot;sit-in&quot; arcade games such as &quot;After Burner&quot; and &quot;Out Run&quot; delivered in the arcades. Another innovative feature was the ability to link two MultiSystems together to allow for head-to-head two player gaming. Release was slated for August that year.

Several games in development had a version produced for the Konix Multisystem, including Vivid Image&#x27;s &quot;Hammerfist&quot;.

A redesigned system oriented around a 32-bit processor clocked at 30 MHz with support for CDs exclusively was announced in 1993 in collaboration with TXC.

==Specifications==
*CPU: 16-bit 8086 processor (running at 6 MHz)
*Co-processor: ASIC processor 
*RAM: 128K RAM - later it would be upgraded to 256K RAM after complaints from developers.
An optional 512K RAM cartridge was considered to boost the total RAM for the machine to 768K.
*Graphics:
**Custom blitter
**4096 colour palette
**Resolutions:
***256×200 (256 colours)
***512×200 (16 colours)
***256×200 (16 colours)
*Sound:
**Custom RISC-based DSP
**Stereo sound
*Storage: Custom 880KB 3.5&quot; disk drive
*Misc: Cartridge expansion slot

===Issues and limitations===

Despite the impressive specification on paper, the design did suffer from some limitations. Nick Speakman of software developer Binary Designs pointed out that &quot;the custom chips are very powerful, but they require a lot of programming talent to get anything out of them. The screen handling [also] isn&#x27;t as fast as we anticipated it to be.&quot;

Brian Pollock of software publisher Logotron highlighted the limitations caused by the shortage of RAM (kept low to keep prices down), “My only concern is memory, or lack of it. For instance, in the game that I&#x27;m writing I am using six-channel FM synthesized sound. Now that takes up a hell of a lot of memory. I couldn&#x27;t usefully fit any more samples, and that&#x27;s sad.”

The memory issue was also flagged by &quot;Crash&quot; magazine, which pointed out that the floppy disk format meant that games had to be loaded into the machine&#x27;s RAM (originally intended to be 128k) in turn requiring the system to be constantly accessing the disk drive. Konix intended to remedy the problem with RAM upgrade cartridges, provided that the price of RAM fell in the future.

Overall though, programmers received the system positively. Jeff Minter described the controller itself as &quot;superb,&quot; while Chris Walsh of Argonaut Games stated that &quot;Polygon based games like &quot;Starglider 2&quot; are going to be easy to program. The machine is geared up to rotating masses of vertices at incredible rates.&quot; However, of the original Flare One&#x27;s vertex computation performance, &quot;Zarch&quot; author David Braben had noted that whilst similar levels of performance might be difficult to achieve on an Archimedes computer, the performance bottlenecks in solid 3D games were actually &quot;scanning databases of shapes and putting polygons on screen&quot;.

Numerous game developers were recruited to produce games for the system, including Jeff Minter&#x27;s Llamasoft, Electronic Arts, Psygnosis, Ocean, Palace and U.S. Gold, with Konix promising 40 games to be available by Christmas. Lucasfilm was mooted as a developer with the possibility of releasing their own branded version of the machine in the US, but nothing was ever confirmed.
Games known to be in development for the system during 1988 included Llamasoft&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Mutant Camels&quot;, System 3&#x27;s &quot;Last Ninja 2&quot;, Vivid Image&#x27;s &quot;Hammerfist&quot;, and Logotron&#x27;s &quot;Star Ray&quot;. A game called Bikers was to be developed by Argonaut Software to be included as a free game with the system.

==Demise==

Signs of trouble in the progress to the release of the console did not take long to arrive. By May the release date had slipped from August to October. By October, a first quarter 1990 release was envisaged. The December edition of &quot;The Games Machine&quot; magazine revealed the scale of the problem. According to company sources, Konix had been on the brink of calling in receivers. Cheques had bounced, employees hadn&#x27;t been paid and software development had been brought to a halt in mid-October as developers had reached the stage where they could continue no further without a finished machine.

In March 1990 it was revealed that Konix had sold the rights to sell their joystick range in the UK to Spectravision who also manufactured the rival QuickShot joystick range. They had effectively sold off the family silver in order to keep the MultiSystem project alive. Autumn 1990 was to be the new release time.

Eventually, beset by delays and in spite of all of the media coverage and apparent demand for the machine, the project ultimately went under when Konix ran out of cash without a completed system ever being released.

==Legacy==

After the project was abandoned, Flare Technology began work on a new project, &quot;Flare Two&quot;, which was eventually bought by Atari and, after further development, formed the basis for the Atari Jaguar game console.

The original Flare One technology was purchased by arcade gambling machine manufacturer Bellfruit for use in their quiz machines. Drivers for these games are also included in the multi emulator MAME.

The Konix Multisystem&#x27;s design was later released independently by a Chinese company called MSC (MultiSystem China) as the MSC Super MS-200E Multi-System, although this was simply an inexpensive PC games controller, without any special internal hardware.

Video taped footage showing several games being worked on for the system survives. Excerpts from the footage were later issued on the cover disc of issue 8 of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine.

<doc id="17412" wikidata="Q23638" url="?curid=17412" title="Klein bottle">
<text>In mathematics, the Klein bottle () is an example of a non-orientable surface; that is, informally, a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down. More formally, the Klein bottle is a two-dimensional manifold on which one cannot define a normal vector at each point that varies continuously over the whole manifold. Other related non-orientable surfaces include the Möbius strip and the real projective plane. While a Möbius strip is a surface with a boundary, a Klein bottle has no boundary. For comparison, a sphere is an orientable surface with no boundary.

The Klein bottle was first described in 1882 by the mathematician Felix Klein.

==Construction==
The following square is a fundamental polygon of the Klein bottle. The idea is to &#x27;glue&#x27; together the corresponding red and blue edges with the arrows matching, as in the diagrams below. Note that this is an &quot;abstract&quot; gluing in the sense that trying to realize this in three dimensions results in a self-intersecting Klein bottle.
To construct the Klein bottle, glue the red arrows of the square together (left and right sides), resulting in a cylinder. To glue the ends of the cylinder together so that the arrows on the circles match, one would pass one end through the side of the cylinder. This creates a curve of self-intersection; this is thus an immersion of the Klein bottle in the three-dimensional space.

This immersion is useful for visualizing many properties of the Klein bottle. For example, the Klein bottle has no &quot;boundary&quot;, where the surface stops abruptly, and it is non-orientable, as reflected in the one-sidedness of the immersion.

The common physical model of a Klein bottle is a similar construction. The Science Museum in London has a collection of hand-blown glass Klein bottles on display, exhibiting many variations on this topological theme. The bottles date from 1995 and were made for the museum by Alan Bennett.

The Klein bottle, proper, does not self-intersect. Nonetheless, there is a way to visualize the Klein bottle as being contained in four dimensions. By adding a fourth dimension to the three-dimensional space, the self-intersection can be eliminated. Gently push a piece of the tube containing the intersection along the fourth dimension, out of the original three-dimensional space. A useful analogy is to consider a self-intersecting curve on the plane; self-intersections can be eliminated by lifting one strand off the plane.
Suppose for clarification that we adopt time as that fourth dimension. Consider how the figure could be constructed in &quot;xyzt&quot;-space. The accompanying illustration (&quot;Time evolution...&quot;) shows one useful evolution of the figure. At the wall sprouts from a bud somewhere near the &quot;intersection&quot; point. After the figure has grown for a while, the earliest section of the wall begins to recede, disappearing like the Cheshire Cat but leaving its ever-expanding smile behind. By the time the growth front gets to where the bud had been, there is nothing there to intersect and the growth completes without piercing existing structure. The 4-figure as defined cannot exist in 3-space but is easily understood in 4-space.

More formally, the Klein bottle is the quotient space described as the square [0,1] × [0,1] with sides identified by the relations for and for .

==Properties==
Like the Möbius strip, the Klein bottle is a two-dimensional manifold which is not orientable. Unlike the Möbius strip, it is a &quot;closed&quot; manifold, meaning it is a compact manifold without boundary. While the Möbius strip can be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, the Klein bottle cannot. It can be embedded in R4, however.

Continuing this sequence, for example creating a 3-manifold which cannot be embedded in R4 but can be in R5, is possible; in this case, connecting two ends of a spherinder to each other in the same manner as the two ends of a cylinder for a Klein bottle, creates a figure, referred to as a &quot;spherinder Klein bottle&quot;, that cannot fully be embedded in R4.

The Klein bottle can be seen as a fiber bundle over the circle &quot;S&quot;1, with fibre &quot;S&quot;1, as follows: one takes the square (modulo the edge identifying equivalence relation) from above to be &quot;E&quot;, the total space, while the base space &quot;B&quot; is given by the unit interval in &quot;y&quot;, modulo &quot;1~0&quot;. The projection π:&quot;E&quot;→&quot;B&quot; is then given by .

The Klein bottle can be constructed (in a four dimensional space, because in three dimensional space it cannot be done without allowing the surface to intersect itself) by joining the edges of two Möbius strips, as described in the following limerick by Leo Moser:

The initial construction of the Klein bottle by identifying opposite edges of a square shows that the Klein bottle can be given a CW complex structure with one 0-cell &quot;P&quot;, two 1-cells &quot;C&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;2 and one 2-cell &quot;D&quot;. Its Euler characteristic is therefore . The boundary homomorphism is given by and , yielding the homology groups of the Klein bottle &quot;K&quot; to be , and for .

There is a 2-1 covering map from the torus to the Klein bottle, because two copies of the fundamental region of the Klein bottle, one being placed next to the mirror image of the other, yield a fundamental region of the torus. The universal cover of both the torus and the Klein bottle is the plane R2.

The fundamental group of the Klein bottle can be determined as the group of deck transformations of the universal cover and has the presentation . It follows that it is isomorphic to formula_1, the only nontrivial semidirect product of the additive group of integers formula_2 with itself.
Six colors suffice to color any map on the surface of a Klein bottle; this is the only exception to the Heawood conjecture, a generalization of the four color theorem, which would require seven.

A Klein bottle is homeomorphic to the connected sum of two projective planes. It is also homeomorphic to a sphere plus two cross-caps.

When embedded in Euclidean space, the Klein bottle is one-sided. However, there are other topological 3-spaces, and in some of the non-orientable examples a Klein bottle can be embedded such that it is two-sided, though due to the nature of the space it remains non-orientable.

==Dissection==

Dissecting a Klein bottle into halves along its plane of symmetry results in two mirror image Möbius strips, i.e. one with a left-handed half-twist and the other with a right-handed half-twist (one of these is pictured on the right). Remember that the intersection pictured is not really there.

==Simple-closed curves==
One description of the types of simple-closed curves that may appear on the surface of the Klein bottle is given by the use of the first homology group of the Klein bottle calculated with integer coefficients. This group is isomorphic to Z×Z2. Up to reversal of orientation, the only homology classes which contain simple-closed curves are as follows: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,1). Up to reversal of the orientation of a simple closed curve, if it lies within one of the two cross-caps that make up the Klein bottle, then it is in homology class (1,0) or (1,1); if it cuts the Klein bottle into two Möbius strips, then it is in homology class (2,0); if it cuts the Klein bottle into an annulus, then it is in homology class (0,1); and if bounds a disk, then it is in homology class (0,0).

==Parametrization==

=== The figure 8 immersion ===
To make the &quot;figure 8&quot; or &quot;bagel&quot; immersion of the Klein bottle, one can start with a Möbius strip and curl it to bring the edge to the midline; since there is only one edge, it will meet itself there, passing through the midline. It has a particularly simple parametrization as a &quot;figure-8&quot; torus with a half-twist:

:formula_3
for 0 ≤ &quot;θ&quot; &lt; 2π, 0 ≤ &quot;v&quot; &lt; 2π and &quot;r&quot; &gt; 2.

In this immersion, the self-intersection circle (where sin(&quot;v&quot;) is zero) is a geometric circle in the &quot;xy&quot; plane. The positive constant &quot;r&quot; is the radius of this circle. The parameter &quot;θ&quot; gives the angle in the &quot;xy&quot; plane as well as the rotation of the figure 8, and &quot;v&quot; specifies the position around the 8-shaped cross section. With the above parametrization the cross section is a 2:1 Lissajous curve.

=== 4-D non-intersecting ===
A non-intersecting 4-D parametrization can be modeled after that of the flat torus:
:formula_4

where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are constants that determine aspect ratio, &quot;θ&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are similar to as defined above. &quot;v&quot; determines the position around the figure-8 as well as the position in the x-y plane. &quot;θ&quot; determines the rotational angle of the figure-8 as well and the position around the z-w plane. &quot;ε&quot; is any small constant and &quot;ε&quot; sin&quot;v&quot; is a small &quot;v&quot; dependent bump in &quot;z-w&quot; space to avoid self intersection. The &quot;v&quot; bump causes the self intersecting 2-D/planar figure-8 to spread out into a 3-D stylized &quot;potato chip&quot; or saddle shape in the x-y-w and x-y-z space viewed edge on. When &quot;ε=0&quot; the self intersection is a circle in the z-w plane &lt;0, 0, cos&quot;θ&quot;, sin&quot;θ&quot;&gt;.

=== 3D pinched torus / 4D Möbius tube ===

The pinched torus is perhaps the simplest parametrization of the klein bottle in both three and four dimensions. It&#x27;s a torus that, in three dimensions, flattens and passes through itself on one side. Unfortunately, in three dimensions this parametrization has two pinch points, which makes it undesirable for some applications. In four dimensions the &quot;z&quot; amplitude rotates into the &quot;w&quot; amplitude and there are no self intersections or pinch points.

:formula_5

One can view this as a tube or cylinder that wraps around, as in a torus, but its circular cross section flips over in four dimensions, presenting its &quot;backside&quot; as it reconnects, just as a Möbius strip cross section rotates before it reconnects. The 3D orthogonal projection of this is the pinched torus shown above. Just as a Möbius strip is a subset of a solid torus, the Möbius tube is a subset of a toroidally closed spherinder (solid spheritorus).

=== Bottle shape ===
The parametrization of the 3-dimensional immersion of the bottle itself is much more complicated. 
:formula_6
for 0 ≤ &quot;u&quot; &lt; π and 0 ≤ &quot;v&quot; &lt; 2π.

== Homotopy classes ==
Regular 3D immersions of the Klein bottle fall into three regular homotopy classes. 
The three are represented by:
* the &quot;traditional&quot; Klein bottle;
* the left-handed figure-8 Klein bottle;
* the right-handed figure-8 Klein bottle.

The traditional Klein bottle immersion is achiral. The figure-8 immersion is chiral. (The pinched torus immersion above is not regular, as it has pinch points, so it is not relevant to this section.)

If the traditional Klein bottle is cut in its plane of symmetry it breaks into two Möbius strips of opposite chirality. A figure-8 Klein bottle can be cut into two Möbius strips of the &quot;same&quot; chirality, and cannot be regularly deformed into its mirror image.

==Generalizations==
The generalization of the Klein bottle to higher genus is given in the article on the fundamental polygon.

In another order of ideas, constructing 3-manifolds, it is known that a solid Klein bottle is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of a Möbius strip and a closed interval. The &quot;solid Klein bottle&quot; is the non-orientable version of the solid torus, equivalent to formula_7

==Klein surface==
A Klein surface is, as for Riemann surfaces, a surface with an atlas allowing the transition maps to be composed using complex conjugation. One can obtain the so-called dianalytic structure of the space, and it has only one side.

<text>Icehenge is a science fiction novel by American author Kim Stanley Robinson, published in 1984.

Though published almost ten years before Robinson&#x27;s Mars trilogy, and taking place in a different version of the future, &quot;Icehenge&quot; contains elements that also appear in his Mars series, such as extreme human longevity, Martian political revolution, historical revisionism, and shifts between primary characters.

==Plot==
&quot;Icehenge&quot; is set at three distinct time periods, and told from the perspective of three different characters.

The first narrative is the diary of an engineer caught up in a Martian political revolution in 2248. Effectively kidnapped aboard a mutinous Martian spaceship, she provides assistance to the revolutionaries in their quest for interstellar travel, but ultimately chooses not to travel with them but to return to the doomed revolution on Mars.

The second narrative is told from the perspective of an archaeologist three centuries later. He is involved in a project investigating the failed revolution, and during this finds the engineer&#x27;s diary buried near the remains of a ruined city. At the same time, a mysterious monument is found at the north pole of Pluto, tying up with a passing mention in the engineer&#x27;s diary.

In the final narrative, the great-grandson of the archaeologist visits the monument on Pluto, a scaled-up version of Stonehenge carved in ice. He is investigating the possibility that both the diary and the monument were planted by a reclusive and wealthy businesswoman who lives in the orbit of Saturn.

==Development history==
The first part of this novel was originally published as the novella &quot;To Leave a Mark&quot; in the November 1982 issue of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. The third part of &quot;Icehenge&quot; was originally published as the novella &quot;On the North Pole of Pluto&quot; in 1980 in the anthology &quot;Orbit&quot; 18 edited by Damon Knight. Robinson gave the novella in rough form to Ursula K. Le Guin to read and edit while he was enrolled in her writing workshop at UCSD in the spring of 1977. Views of Saturn from the space station visited by the narrator of the novel&#x27;s third section were inspired by images of Saturn taken during the Voyager flybys in 1980–1981.

<doc id="17415" wikidata="Q1973258" url="?curid=17415" title="Knights Who Say &quot;Ni!&quot;">
<text>The Knights Who Say &quot;Ni!&quot;, also called the Knights of Ni, are a band of knights encountered by King Arthur and his followers in the 1975 film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; and the play &quot;Spamalot&quot;. They demonstrate their power by shouting &quot;Ni!&quot; (pronounced ), terrifying the party, whom they refuse to allow passage through their forest unless appeased through the gift of a shrubbery.

== Description ==
The knights appear silhouetted in a misty wood, wearing robes and horned helmets; their full number is never apparent, but there are at least six. The leader of the knights, played by Michael Palin, is the only one who speaks to the party. He is nearly double Arthur&#x27;s height, and wears a great helm decorated with long antlers. The other knights are large, but of human proportions, and wear visored sallet helmets decorated with cow horns. The knight explains that they are the &quot;keepers of the sacred words &#x27;Ni&#x27;, &#x27;Peng&#x27;, and &#x27;Neee-Wom&#x27;&quot;. Arthur confides to Sir Bedivere, &quot;those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!&quot;

== Tasks ==
The knights demand a sacrifice, and when Arthur states that he merely wishes to pass through the woods, the knights begin shouting &quot;Ni!&quot;, forcing the party to shrink back in fear. After this demonstration of their power, the head knight threatens to say &quot;Ni!&quot; again unless the travellers appease them with a shrubbery; otherwise they shall never pass through the wood alive. When Arthur questions the demand, the knights again shout &quot;Ni!&quot; until the travellers agree to bring them a shrubbery, which the head knight specifies must be &quot;one that looks nice. And not too expensive.&quot;

In order to fulfill their promise to the Knights of Ni, the party visits a small village, where Arthur and Bedivere ask an old crone where they can obtain a shrubbery. The woman questions them, and Arthur admits that it is for the Knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot;, whereupon she refuses to cooperate. Arthur then threatens to say &quot;Ni!&quot; to the old woman unless she helps them, and when she still refuses, begins shouting &quot;Ni!&quot;. Bedivere has trouble saying the sacred word, which he pronounces &quot;Nu!&quot; until Arthur demonstrates the correct technique. As the crone shrinks back from their combined assault, they are interrupted by Roger the Shrubber, who laments the lack of law and order that allows ruffians to say &quot;Ni!&quot; to an old woman. Arthur obtains a shrubbery from Roger, and brings it to the Knights of Ni.

The head knight acknowledges that &quot;it is a good shrubbery&quot;, but asserts that the knights cannot allow Arthur and his followers to pass through the wood because they are no longer the Knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot;, now being the Knights who say &quot;Ekke Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing!&quot;, and must therefore give Arthur a test. Unable to pronounce the new name, Arthur addresses them as &quot;Knights who until recently said &#x27;Ni!, inquiring as to the nature of the test.

The head knight demands another shrubbery, to be placed next to but slightly higher than the first; and then Arthur &quot;must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest—with a herring!&quot; The knight presents a herring to be used. Arthur objects, asserting that &quot;it can&#x27;t be done!&quot; upon which the knights recoil as though in fear and pain. It soon emerges that the knights are unable to withstand the word &quot;it&quot;, which Arthur&#x27;s party is unable to avoid saying. The knights are soon incapacitated by the word, which even the head knight cannot stop repeating, allowing Arthur and his followers to make their escape.

== Film notes ==
In the original screenplay, it was suggested that the head knight be played by &quot;Mike standing on John&#x27;s shoulders&quot;. In the DVD commentary for the film, Michael Palin states that their use of the word &quot;Ni!&quot; was derived from &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. Later, Palin gave another inspiration – his history teacher at Shrewsbury School, Laurence Le Quesne, who had the habit of saying &quot;Ni&quot; while searching for books. Upon Arthur&#x27;s return, the knights were to have said, &quot;Neeeow...wum...ping!&quot;

== Contemporary scholarship ==
The Knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot; have been cited as an example of intentional disregard for historical accuracy in neo-medievalism, which may be contrasted with the casual disregard for historical accuracy inherent in more traditional works of the fantasy genre. However, in &quot;Medievalisms: Making the Past in the Present&quot;, the authors suggest that the original characters of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; actually represent medievalism, rather than neomedievalism, as many of the film&#x27;s details are in fact based on authentic medieval texts and ideas. With respect to the Knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot;, the authors suggest that Sir Bedivere&#x27;s difficulty pronouncing &quot;Ni!&quot;, despite its levity, &quot;carries a very learned joke about the difficulties of pronouncing Middle English&quot;, alluding to the Great Vowel Shift, which occurred in English during the late medieval period.

<text>A Künstlerroman (; plural &quot;-ane&quot;), meaning &quot;artist&#x27;s novel&quot; in English, is a narrative about an artist&#x27;s growth to maturity. It could be classified as a sub-category of &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;: a coming-of-age novel. According to &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;, one way a Künstlerroman may differ from a Bildungsroman is its ending, where a Künstlerroman hero rejects the everyday life, but a Bildungsroman hero settles for being an ordinary citizen. According to &quot;Oxford Reference&quot;, the difference may lie in a longer view across the Künstlerroman hero&#x27;s whole life, not just their childhood years.

<text>Kwanzaa () is an annual celebration of African-American culture from December 26 to January 1, culminating in a communal feast called &quot;Karamu&quot;, usually on the sixth day. It was created by activist Maulana Karenga based on African harvest festival traditions from various parts of West, East, as well as Southeast Africa. There is even an acknowledgement of the customs of the Mizrahi Jewish people from Northern Africa. Kwanzaa was first celebrated in 1966. Twenty-first-century estimates place the number of Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa between 500,000 and 2,000,000.

==History and etymology==
American black separatist Maulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in 1966 during the aftermath of the Watts riots as a non-Christian, specifically African-American holiday. Karenga said his goal was to &quot;give black people an alternative to the existing holiday of Christmas and give black people an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society.&quot; For Karenga, a figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of such holidays also underscored the essential premise that &quot;you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.&quot;

According to Karenga, the name Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase &quot;matunda ya kwanza&quot;, meaning &quot;first fruits&quot;. First fruits festivals exist in Southern Africa and are celebrated in December/January with the southern solstice. Karenga was partly inspired by an account he read of the Zulu festival Umkhosi Wokweshwama. It was decided to spell the holiday&#x27;s name with an additional &quot;a&quot; so that it would have a symbolic seven letters.

During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas. He believed Jesus was psychotic and Christianity was a &quot;White&quot; religion that Black people should shun. As Kwanzaa gained mainstream adherents, Karenga altered his position so practicing Christians would not be alienated, stating in the 1997 book &quot;Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture&quot; that &quot;Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.&quot; Many African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.

After its creation in California, Kwanzaa spread outside the United States.

==Nguzo Saba (The Seven Principles)==
Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or Nguzo Saba (originally Nguzu Saba – the seven principles of African Heritage). They were developed in 1965, a year before Kwanzaa itself. These seven principles are all Swahili words, and together comprise the &quot;Kawaida&quot; or &quot;common&quot; philosophy, a synthesis of nationalist, pan-Africanist, and socialist values. 

Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the principles, as follows:

# Umoja (Unity): To strive for and to maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.
# Kujichagulia (Self-determination): To define and name ourselves, as well as to create and speak for ourselves.
# Ujima (Collective work and responsibility): To build and maintain our community together and make our brothers&#x27; and sisters&#x27; problems our problems and to solve them together.
# Ujamaa (Cooperative economics): To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.
# Nia (Purpose): To make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.
# Kuumba (Creativity): To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.
# Imani (Faith): To believe with all our hearts in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.

==Symbols==
Kwanzaa celebratory symbols include a mat (&quot;Mkeka&quot;) on which other symbols are placed: 

* a &quot;Kinara&quot; (candle holder for seven candlesticks)
* &quot;Mishumaa Saba&quot; (seven candles)
* &quot;mazao&quot; (crops)
* &quot;Mahindi&quot; (corn), to represent the children celebrating (and corn may be part of the holiday meal).
* a &quot;Kikombe cha Umoja&quot; (unity cup) for commemorating and giving &quot;shukrani&quot; (thanks) to African Ancestors
* &quot;Zawadi&quot; (gifts). 

Supplemental representations include a Nguzo Saba poster, the black, red, and green &quot;bendera&quot; (flag), and African books and artworks—all to represent values and concepts reflective of African culture and contribution to community building and reinforcement.

==Observances==

Families celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art, colorful African cloth such as &quot;kente&quot;, especially the wearing of kaftans by women, and fresh fruits representing African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice (&quot;Kikombe cha Umoja&quot;) passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. &quot;Joyous Kwanzaa&quot; may be used as a greeting during the holiday.

A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the &quot;African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness,&quot; contemplation on the Pan-African colors, discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter of African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performances, and, finally, a feast of faith known as &quot;Karamu Ya Imani&quot;. The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is &quot;Habari Gani?&quot;, which is Swahili for &quot;How are you?&quot;

At first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of &quot;kujichagulia&quot; (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, some African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and the New Year.

Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song, and poetry.

=== Karamu ===
A &quot;Karamu Ya Imani&quot; (Feast of Faith) is a feast typically on December 31, the sixth day of the Kwanzaa period. The Karamu feast was developed in Chicago during a 1971 citywide movement of Pan-African organizations. Hannibal Afrik of Shule ya Watoto proposed it as a community-wide promotional and educational campaign. The initial &quot;Karamu Ya Imani&quot; occurred on January 1, 1973, at a 200-person gathering at the Ridgeland club.

In 1992, the National Black United Front (NBUF) of Chicago held one of the country&#x27;s largest &quot;Karamu Ya Imani&quot; celebrations. It included dancing, a youth ensemble and a keynote speech by NBUF and prominent Black nationalist leader Conrad Worrill.

The celebration includes the following practices:

* Kukaribisha (Welcoming)
* Kuumba (Remembering)
* Kuchunguza Tena Na Kutoa Ahadi Tena (Reassessment and Recommitment)
* Kushangilia (Rejoicing)
* Tamshi la Tambiko (Libation Statement)
* Tamshi la Tutaonana (The Farewell Statement)

==Adherence==

The popularity of celebration of Kwanzaa has declined with the waning of the popularity of the black separatist movement. Kwanzaa observation has declined in both community and commercial contexts. University of Minnesota Professor Keith Mayes did not report exact figures, noting that it is also difficult to determine these for the three other main African-American holidays, which he names as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Malcolm X Day, and Juneteenth. Mayes added that white institutions now also celebrate it.

In a 2019 National Retail Federation poll, 2.6 percent of people who planned to celebrate a winter holiday said they would celebrate Kwanzaa. Roughly 14% of the United States population is African American.

Starting in the 1990s, the holiday became increasingly commercialized, with the first Hallmark card being sold in 1992. Some have expressed concern about this potentially damaging the holiday&#x27;s values.

==Recognition==
The first Kwanzaa stamp, designed by Synthia Saint James, was issued by the United States Post Office in 1997, and in the same year Bill Clinton gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday. Subsequent presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden also issued greetings to celebrate Kwanzaa.

Maya Angelou narrated a 2008 documentary film about Kwanzaa, &quot;The Black Candle&quot;, written and directed by M. K. Asante and featuring Chuck D.

In the Arthur (TV series) special &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Perfect Christmas&quot;, Brain&#x27;s family celebrated Kwanzaa as a family, and added a Kwanzaa Ice Cream Special (red, black, and green ice cream) to their ice cream shop menu. 

==Practice outside the United States==
Other countries where Kwanzaa is celebrated include Jamaica, France, Canada, and Brazil.

In Canada it is celebrated in provinces including Saskatchewan and Ontario. Kwanzaa week was first declared in Toronto in 2018. There are local chapters that emerged in the 2010s in provinces like British Columbia, where there are much smaller groups of the diaspora, founding members may be immigrants from countries like Uganda.
