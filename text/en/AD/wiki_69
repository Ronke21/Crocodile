<doc id="17992" wikidata="Q313638" url="?curid=17992" title="Lafcadio Hearn">
<text>, born Patrick Lafcadio Hearn (), was a Greek-British writer, translator, and teacher who introduced the culture and literature of Japan to the West. His writings offered unprecedented insight into Japanese culture, especially his collections of legends and ghost stories, such as &quot;&quot;. Before moving to Japan and becoming a Japanese citizen, he worked as a journalist in the United States, primarily in Cincinnati and New Orleans. His writings about New Orleans, based on his decade-long stay there, are also well-known. His home in Orleans Parish is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum is in Japan.

Hearn was born on the Greek island of Lefkada, after which a complex series of conflicts and events led to his being moved to Dublin, where he was abandoned first by his mother, then his father, and finally by his father&#x27;s aunt (who had been appointed his official guardian). At the age of 19, he emigrated to the United States, where he found work as a newspaper reporter, first in Cincinnati and later in New Orleans. From there, he was sent as a correspondent to the French West Indies, where he stayed for two years, and then to Japan, where he would remain for the rest of his life.

In Japan, Hearn married Koizumi Setsuko, with whom he had four children. His writings about Japan offered the Western world greater insight into a still largely unfamiliar culture.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Patrick Lafcadio Hearn was born on the Greek Ionian Island of Lefkada on 27 June 1850. His mother was a Greek named Rosa Cassimati, a native of the Greek island of Kythira, while his father, Charles Bush Hearn, a British Army medical officer, was of Irish and English descent, who was stationed in Lefkada during the British protectorate of the United States of the Ionian Islands. Throughout his life, Lafcadio boasted of his Greek blood and felt a passionate connection to Greece. He was baptized Patrikios Lefcadios Hearn (Greek: Πατρίκιος Λευκάδιος Χερν) in the Greek Orthodox Church, but he seems to have been called &quot;Patrick Lefcadio Kassimati Charles Hearn&quot; in English; the middle name &quot;Lafcadio&quot; was given to him in honour of the island where he was born. Hearn&#x27;s parents were married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on 25 November 1849, several months after his mother had given birth to Hearn&#x27;s older brother, George Robert Hearn, on 24 July 1849. George died on 17 August 1850, two months after Lafcadio&#x27;s birth.

====Emigration to Ireland and abandonment====

Hearn&#x27;s father Charles was promoted to Staff Surgeon Second Class and in 1850 was reassigned from Lefkada to the British West Indies. Since his family did not approve of the marriage, and because he was worried that his relationship might harm his career prospects, Charles did not inform his superiors of his son or pregnant wife and left his family behind. In 1852, he arranged to send his son and wife to live with his family in Dublin, where they received a cool reception. Charles&#x27;s Protestant mother, Elizabeth Holmes Hearn, had difficulty accepting Rosa&#x27;s Greek Orthodox views and lack of education; she was illiterate and spoke no English. Not surprisingly, Rosa found it difficult to adapt to a foreign culture and the Protestantism of her husband&#x27;s family, and was eventually taken under the wing of Elizabeth&#x27;s sister, Sarah Holmes Brenane, a widow who had converted to Catholicism.

Despite Sarah&#x27;s efforts, Rosa suffered from homesickness. When her husband returned to Ireland on medical leave in 1853, it became clear that the couple had become estranged. Charles Hearn was assigned to the Crimean Peninsula, again leaving his pregnant wife and child in Ireland. When he came back in 1856, severely wounded and traumatized, Rosa had returned to her home island of Cerigo in Greece, where she gave birth to their third son, Daniel James Hearn. Lafcadio had been left in the care of Sarah Brenane.

Charles petitioned to have the marriage with Rosa annulled, on the grounds that she had not signed their marriage contract, which made it invalid under English law. After being informed of the annulment, Rosa almost immediately married Giovanni Cavallini, a Greek citizen of Italian ancestry, who was later appointed by the British as governor of Cerigotto. Cavallini required as a condition of the marriage that Rosa give up custody of both Lafcadio and James. As a result, James was sent to his father in Dublin while Lafcadio remained in the care of Sarah, who had disinherited Charles because of the annulment. Neither Lafcadio nor James ever again saw their mother, who had four children with her second husband. Rosa was eventually committed to the National Mental Asylum on Corfu, where she died in 1882.

Charles Hearn, who had left Lafcadio in the care of Sarah Brenane for the past four years, now appointed her as Lafcadio&#x27;s permanent guardian. He married his childhood sweetheart, Alicia Goslin, in July 1857, and left with his new wife for a posting in Secunderabad, a city in India, where they had three daughters prior to Alicia&#x27;s death in 1861. Lafcadio never saw his father again: Charles Hearn died of malaria in the Gulf of Suez in 1866.

In 1857, at age seven and despite the fact that both his parents were still alive, Hearn became the permanent ward of his great aunt, Sarah Brenane. She divided her residency between Dublin in the winter months, and her husband&#x27;s estate at Tramore, County Waterford, on the southern Irish coast, and a house at Bangor, North Wales. Brenane also engaged a tutor during the school year to provide Lefcadio with basic instruction and the rudiments of Catholic dogma. Hearn began exploring Brenane&#x27;s library and read extensively in Greek literature, especially myths.

====Catholic education and more abandonment====

In 1861, Hearn&#x27;s great aunt, aware that Lefcadio was turning away from Catholicism and at the urging of Henry Hearn Molyneux, a relative of her late husband, he was sent to a Catholic college in France, but was disgusted with the life and gave up the Roman Catholic faith. Yet on the bright side, he became fluent in French and would later translate into English the works of Guy de Maupassant and Gustave Flaubert.

In 1863, again at the suggestion of Molyneux, Hearn was enrolled at St. Cuthbert&#x27;s College, Ushaw, a Catholic seminary at what is now the University of Durham. In this environment, Hearn adopted the nickname &quot;Paddy&quot; to try to fit in better, and was the top student in English composition for three years. At age 16, while at Ushaw, Hearn injured his left eye in a schoolyard mishap. The eye became infected and, despite consultations with specialists in Dublin and London, and a year spent out of school convalescing, the eye went blind. Hearn also suffered from severe myopia, so his injury left him permanently with poor vision, requiring him to carry a magnifying glass for close work and a pocket telescope to see anything beyond a short distance. Hearn avoided eyeglasses, believing they would gradually weaken his vision further. The iris was permanently discolored, and left Hearn self-conscious about his appearance for the rest of his life, causing him to cover his left eye while conversing and always posing for the camera in profile so that the left eye was not visible.

In 1867, Henry Molyneux, who had become Sarah Brenane&#x27;s financial manager, went bankrupt, along with Brenane. As there was no money for tuition, Lefcadio was sent to London&#x27;s East End to live with Brenane&#x27;s former maid. She and her husband had little time or money for Hearn, who wandered the streets, spent time in workhouses, and generally lived an aimless, rootless existence. His main intellectual activities consisted of visits to libraries and the British Museum.

===Immigration to Cincinnati===
By 1869, Henry Molyneux had recovered some financial stability and Brenane, now 75, was infirm. Resolving to end his financial obligations to the 19-year-old Hearn, he purchased a one-way ticket to New York and instructed the young man to find his way to Cincinnati, where he could locate Molyneux&#x27;s sister and her husband, Thomas Cullinan, and obtain their assistance in making a living. Upon meeting Hearn in Cincinnati, however, it became clear that the family wanted little to do with him: Cullinan all but threw him out into the streets with only $5 in his pocket. As Hearn would later write, &quot;I was dropped moneyless on the pavement of an American city to begin life.&quot;

For a time, he was impoverished, living in stables or store rooms in exchange for menial labor. He eventually befriended the English printer and communalist Henry Watkin, who employed him in his printing business, helped find him various odd jobs, lent him books from his library, including utopianists Fourier, Dixon and Noyes, and gave Hearn a nickname which stuck with him for the rest of his life, The Raven, from the Poe poem. Hearn also frequented the Cincinnati Public Library, which at that time had an estimated 50,000 volumes. In the spring of 1871 a letter from Henry Molyneux informed him of Sarah Brenane&#x27;s death and Molyneux&#x27;s appointment as sole executor. Despite Brenane having named him as the beneficiary of an annuity when she became his guardian, Hearn received nothing from the estate and never heard from Molyneux again.

====Newspaper and literary work====

By the strength of his talent as a writer, Hearn obtained a job as a reporter for the &quot;Cincinnati Daily Enquirer&quot;, working for the newspaper from 1872 to 1875. Writing with creative freedom in one of Cincinnati&#x27;s largest circulating newspapers, he became known for his lurid accounts of local murders, developing a reputation as the paper&#x27;s premier sensational journalist, as well as the author of sensitive accounts of some of the disadvantaged people of Cincinnati. &quot;The Library of America&quot; selected one of these murder accounts, &quot;Gibbeted,&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of &quot;American True Crime&quot;, published in 2008. After one of his murder stories, the Tanyard Murder, had run for several months in 1874, Hearn established his reputation as Cincinnati&#x27;s most audacious journalist, and the &quot;Enquirer&quot; raised his salary from $10 to $25 per week.

In 1874, Hearn and the young Henry Farny, later a renowned painter of the American West, wrote, illustrated, and published an 8-page weekly journal of art, literature and satire entitled &quot;Ye Giglampz.&quot; The Cincinnati Public Library reprinted a facsimile of all nine issues in 1983. The work was considered by a twentieth century critic to be &quot;Perhaps the most fascinating sustained project he undertook as an editor.&quot;

====Marriage and firing by the &quot;Enquirer&quot;====
On 14 June 1874, Hearn, aged 23, married Alethea (&quot;Mattie&quot;) Foley, a 20-year-old African American woman, and former slave, an action in violation of Ohio&#x27;s anti-miscegenation law at that time. In August 1875, in response to complaints from a local clergyman about his anti-religious views and pressure from local politicians embarrassed by some of his satirical writing in &quot;Ye Giglampz,&quot; the &quot;Enquirer&quot; fired him, citing as its reason his illegal marriage. He went to work for the rival newspaper &quot;The Cincinnati Commercial.&quot; The &quot;Enquirer&quot; offered to re-hire him after his stories began appearing in the &quot;Commercial&quot; and its circulation began increasing, but Hearn, incensed at the paper&#x27;s behavior, refused. Hearn and Foley separated, but attempted reconciliation several times before divorcing in 1877. Foley remarried in 1880. While working for the &quot;Commercial&quot; he championed the case of Henrietta Wood, a former slave who won a major reparations case.

While working for the &quot;Commercial&quot; Hearn agreed to be carried to the top of Cincinnati&#x27;s tallest building on the back of a famous steeplejack, Joseph Roderiguez Weston, and wrote a half-terrified, half-comic account of the experience. It was also during this time that Hearn wrote a series of accounts of the Bucktown and Levee neighborhoods of Cincinnati, &quot;...one of the few depictions we have of black life in a border city during the post-Civil War period.&quot; He also wrote about local black song lyrics from the era, including a song titled &quot;Shiloh&quot; that was dedicated to a Bucktown resident named &quot;Limber Jim.&quot; In addition, Hearn had printed in the &quot;Commercial&quot; a stanza he had overheard when listening to the songs of the roustabouts, working on the city&#x27;s levee waterfront. Similar stanzas were recorded in song by Julius Daniels in 1926 and Tommy McClennan in his version of &quot;Bottle Up and Go&quot; (1939).

===Move to New Orleans===

During the autumn of 1877, recently divorced from Mattie Foley and restless, Hearn had begun neglecting his newspaper work in favor of translating works by the French author Théophile Gautier into English. He had also grown increasingly disenchanted with Cincinnati, writing to Henry Watkin, &quot;It is time for a fellow to get out of Cincinnati when they begin to call it the Paris of America.&quot; With the support of Watkin and &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot; publisher Murat Halstead, Hearn left Cincinnati for New Orleans, where he initially wrote dispatches on the &quot;Gateway to the Tropics&quot; for the &quot;Commercial&quot;.

Hearn lived in New Orleans for nearly a decade, writing first for the newspaper &quot;Daily City Item&quot; beginning in June 1878, and later for the &quot;Times Democrat&quot;. Since the &quot;Item&quot; was a 4-page publication, Hearn&#x27;s editorial work changed the character of the newspaper dramatically. He began at the &quot;Item&quot; as a news editor, expanding to include book reviews of Bret Harte and Émile Zola, summaries of pieces in national magazines such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and editorial pieces introducing Buddhism and Sanskrit writings. As editor, Hearn created and published nearly two hundred woodcuts of daily life and people in New Orleans, making the &quot;Item&quot; the first Southern newspaper to introduce cartoons and giving the paper an immediate boost in circulation. Hearn gave up carving the woodcuts after six months when he found the strain was too great for his eye.

At the end of 1881, Hearn took an editorial position with the New Orleans &quot;Times Democrat&quot; and was employed translating items from French and Spanish newspapers as well as writing editorials and cultural reviews on topics of his choice. He also continued his work translating French authors into English: Gérard de Nerval, Anatole France, and most notably Pierre Loti, an author who influenced Hearn&#x27;s own writing style. Milton Bronner, who edited Hearn&#x27;s letters to Henry Watkin, wrote: &quot;[T]he Hearn of New Orleans was the father of the Hearn of the West Indies and of Japan,&quot; and this view was endorsed by Norman Foerster. During his tenure at the &quot;Times Democrat&quot;, Hearn also developed a friendship with editor Page Baker, who went on to champion Hearn&#x27;s literary career; their correspondence is archived at the Loyola University New Orleans Special Collections &amp; Archives.

The vast number of his writings about New Orleans and its environs, many of which have not been collected, include the city&#x27;s Creole population and distinctive cuisine, the French Opera, and Louisiana Voodoo. Hearn wrote enthusiastically of New Orleans, but also wrote of the city&#x27;s decay, &quot;a dead bride crowned with orange flowers&quot;.

Hearn&#x27;s writings for national publications, such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, helped create the popular reputation of New Orleans as a place with a distinctive culture more akin to that of Europe and the Caribbean than to the rest of North America. Hearn&#x27;s best-known Louisiana works include: 
* &quot;Gombo zhèbes: Little dictionary of Creole proverbs&quot; (1885)
* &quot;La Cuisine Créole&quot; (1885), a collection of culinary recipes from leading chefs and noted Creole housewives who helped make New Orleans famous for its cuisine
* &quot;Chita: A Memory of Last Island&quot; (1889), a novella based on the hurricane of 1856 first published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; in 1888

Hearn also published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; the first known written article (1883) about Filipinos in the United States, the Manilamen or Tagalogs, one of whose villages he had visited at Saint Malo, southeast of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.

At the time he lived there, Hearn was little known, and even now he is little known for his writing about New Orleans, except by local cultural devotees. However, more books have been written about him than any former resident of New Orleans except Louis Armstrong.

Hearn&#x27;s writings for the New Orleans newspapers included impressionistic descriptions of places and characters and many editorials denouncing political corruption, street crime, violence, intolerance, and the failures of public health and hygiene officials. Despite the fact that he is credited with &quot;inventing&quot; New Orleans as an exotic and mysterious place, his obituaries of the vodou leaders Marie Laveau and Doctor John Montenet are matter-of-fact and debunking. Selections of Hearn&#x27;s New Orleans writings have been collected and published in several works, starting with &quot;Creole Sketches&quot; in 1924, and more recently in &quot;Inventing New Orleans: Writings of Lafcadio Hearn.&quot;

===Move to the French West Indies===

&quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; sent Hearn to the West Indies as a correspondent in 1887. He spent two years in Martinique and in addition to his writings for the magazine, produced two books: &quot;Two Years in the French West Indies&quot; and &quot;Youma, The Story of a West-Indian Slave&quot;, both published in 1890.

===Later life in Japan===
In 1890, Hearn went to Japan with a commission as a newspaper correspondent, which was quickly terminated. It was in Japan, however, that he found a home and his greatest inspiration. Through the good will of Basil Hall Chamberlain, Hearn gained a teaching position during the summer of 1890 at the Shimane Prefectural Common Middle School and Normal School in Matsue, a town in western Japan on the coast of the Sea of Japan. During his fifteen-month stay in Matsue, Hearn married Koizumi Setsuko, the daughter of a local samurai family, with whom he had four children: Kazuo, Iwao, Kiyoshi, and Suzuko. He became a Japanese citizen, assuming the legal name Koizumi Yakumo in 1896 after accepting a teaching position in Tokyo; Koizumi is his wife&#x27;s surname and Yakumo is from &quot;yakumotatsu&quot;, a poetic modifier word (&quot;makurakotoba&quot;) for Izumo Province, which he translated as &quot;the Place of the Issuing of Clouds&quot;. After having been Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and, later on, Spencerian, he became Buddhist.

During late 1891, Hearn obtained another teaching position in Kumamoto, at the Fifth High Middle School (a predecessor of Kumamoto University), where he spent the next three years and completed his book &quot;Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan&quot; (1894). In October 1894, he secured a journalism job with the English-language newspaper &quot;Kobe Chronicle&quot;, and in 1896, with some assistance from Chamberlain, he began teaching English literature at Tokyo Imperial University, a job he had until 1903. In 1904, he was a lecturer at Waseda University.

While in Japan, he encountered the art of ju-jutsu which made a deep impression upon him: &quot;Hearn, who encountered judo in Japan at the end of the nineteenth century, contemplated its concepts with the awed tones of an explorer staring about him in an extraordinary and undiscovered land. &quot;What Western brain could have elaborated this strange teaching, never to oppose force by force, but only direct and utilize the power of attack; to overthrow the enemy solely through his own strength, to vanquish him solely by his own efforts? Surely none! The Western mind appears to work in straight lines; the Oriental, in wonderful curves and circles.&quot; When he was teaching at the Fifth High Middle School, the headmaster was founder of Judo Kano Jigoro himself.
==Death==

On 26 September 1904, Hearn died of heart failure in Tokyo at the age of 54. His grave is at the Zōshigaya Cemetery in Tokyo&#x27;s Toshima district.

==Legacy==
===Literary tradition===
In the late 19th century, Japan was still largely unknown and exotic to Westerners. However, with the introduction of Japanese aesthetics, particularly at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, Japanese styles became fashionable in Western countries. Consequently, Hearn became known to the world by his writings concerning Japan. In later years, some critics would accuse Hearn of exoticizing Japan, but because he offered the West some of its first descriptions of pre-industrial and Meiji Era Japan, his work is generally regarded as having historical value.

Admirers of Hearn&#x27;s work have included Ben Hecht, John Erskine, Malcolm Cowley and Jorge Luis Borges.

Hearn was a major translator of the short stories of Guy de Maupassant.

Yone Noguchi is quoted as saying about Hearn, &quot;His Greek temperament and French culture became frost-bitten as a flower in the North.&quot;

Hearn won a wide following in Japan, where his books were translated and remain popular to the present day. Hearn&#x27;s appeal to Japanese readers &quot;lies in the glimpses he offered of an older, more mystical Japan lost during the country’s hectic plunge into Western-style industrialization and nation building. His books are treasured here as a trove of legends and folk tales that otherwise might have vanished because no Japanese had bothered to record them.&quot;

===Museums===
The Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum and his old residence in Matsue are still two of the city&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions. In addition, another small museum dedicated to Hearn opened in Yaizu, Shizuoka, in 2007 (:ja:焼津小泉八雲記念館).

The first museum in Europe for Lafcadio Hearn was inaugurated in Lefkada, Greece, his birthplace, on 4 July 2014, as Lefcadio Hearn Historical Center. It contains early editions, rare books and Japanese collectibles. The visitors, through photos, texts and exhibits, can wander in the significant events of Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s life, but also in the civilizations of Europe, America and Japan of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries through his lectures, writings and tales. The municipalities of Kumamoto, Matsue, Shinjuku, Yaizu, Toyama University, the Koizumi family and other people from Japan and Greece contributed to the establishment of Lefcadio Hearn Historical Center.

On a trip to Matsue in 2012, Professor Bon Koizumi (Hearn&#x27;s great-grandson) and his wife Shoko were introduced by keen supporters of Lafcadio to Dublin-based Motoko Fujita, a published photographer of The Shadow of James Joyce (Lilliput Press Ltd., Ireland, 2011) and the founder of the Experience Japan Festival in Dublin. Acting on the Koizumi&#x27;s desire to reconnect with their Irish roots, Fujita then coordinated a trip for Bon and Shoko in autumn 2013, during which key relationships to more Lafcadio supporters in Ireland were forged. Fujita&#x27;s initiative led to the exhibition &quot;Coming Home: The Open Mind of Patrick Lafcadio Hearn&quot; at The Little Museum of Dublin (15 October 2015 to 3 January 2016), the first time Hearn was honoured in the city. The exhibit contained first editions of Hearn&#x27;s works and personal items from the Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum. Professor Bon Koizumi was in attendance at the opening of the exhibition. Fujita also initiated the planning of a Japanese garden in Hearn&#x27;s honour, and in 2015 the Lafcadio Hearn Japanese Gardens in Tramore, County Waterford opened. 
There is also a cultural centre named after Hearn at the University of Durham, where in 2022 a conference &quot;Lafcadio Hearn and the Global Imagination at the Fin de Siècle&quot; was held.

===Sister cities===
His life journey later connected its both ends; Lefkada and Shinjuku became sister cities in 1989. Another pair of cities he lived in, New Orleans and Matsue, did the same in 1994.

===Media and theater===
The Japanese director Masaki Kobayashi adapted four Hearn tales into his 1964 film, &quot;Kwaidan&quot;. Some of his stories have been adapted by Ping Chong into his puppet theatre, including the 1999 &quot;Kwaidan&quot; and the 2002 &quot;OBON: Tales of Moonlight and Rain&quot;.

In 1984, four episode Japanese TV series &quot;Nihon no omokage&quot; (:ja:日本の面影, Remnants of Japan), depicting Hearn&#x27;s departure from the United States and later life in Japan, was broadcast with Greek-American actor George Chakiris as Hearn. The story was later adapted to theatrical productions.

Two manga book versions of Hearn’s Japanese stories have been made by writer, Sean Michael Wilson, who lives in Kumamoto, as Hearn did, and is also half Irish. These are ’The Faceless Ghost’ (2015) with Japanese artist Michiru Morikawa, and ‘Manga Yokai Stories’(2020) with Japanese artist Ai Takita.

The video game series Touhou Project is heavily influenced by Hearn&#x27;s works. This doujin series is about a fantasy world known as &quot;Gensokyo&quot;, separated from &quot;our&quot; world with a magical barrier, which world was stuck on the late Edo period.
Two of its most important characters, Yukari Yakumo and Maribel Hearn, are direct references to Lafcadio Hearn. Yukari is a powerful Yōkai who helped create the border separating Gensokyo from the outside world, and Maribel Hearn is a college student (In a master&#x27;s degree on &quot;Relative Psychology&quot;) who lives in Kyoto who is able to see Gensokyo in her dreams. ZUN (the sole writer of the Touhou series), ambiguously stated that these two characters are the same person, although their exact relationship, or how it came to be, is unknown. Yukari Yakumo appears on a major role in many Touhou games, books and manga, and considered as &quot;a mastermind who only takes action once its really required&quot;, and Maribel appears in the stories included in &quot;ZUN&#x27;s Music Collection&quot;, a series of music CD albums, from the 2nd installment onwards, alongside another character, Renko Usami.

<text>Learning theory describes how students receive, process, and retain knowledge during learning. Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a worldview, is acquired or changed and knowledge and skills retained.

Behaviorists look at learning as an aspect of conditioning and advocating a system of rewards and targets in education. Educators who embrace cognitive theory believe that the definition of learning as a change in behaviour is too narrow, and study the learner rather than their environment—and in particular the complexities of human memory. Those who advocate constructivism believe that a learner&#x27;s ability to learn relies largely on what they already know and understand, and the acquisition of knowledge should be an individually tailored process of construction. Transformative learning theory focuses on the often-necessary change required in a learner&#x27;s preconceptions and worldview. Geographical learning theory focuses on the ways that contexts and environments shape the learning process.

Outside the realm of educational psychology, techniques to directly observe the functioning of the brain during the learning process, such as event-related potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging, are used in educational neuroscience. The theory of multiple intelligences, where learning is seen as the interaction between dozens of different functional areas in the brain each with their own individual strengths and weaknesses in any particular human learner, has also been proposed, but empirical research has found the theory to be unsupported by evidence.

==Educational philosophy==
===Classical theorists===

====Plato====

Plato (428 BC–347 BC) proposed the question: &quot;How does an individual learn something new when the topic is brand new to that person?&quot;, This question may seem trivial; however, think of a human-like a computer. The question would then become: How does a computer take in any factual information without previous programming? Plato answered his own question by stating that knowledge is present at birth and all information learned by a person is merely a recollection of something the soul has already learned previously, which is called the Theory of Recollection or Platonic epistemology. This answer could be further justified by a paradox: If a person knows something, they don&#x27;t need to question it, and if a person does not know something, they don&#x27;t know to question it. Plato says that if one did not previously know something, then they cannot learn it. He describes learning as a passive process, where information and knowledge are ironed into the soul over time. However, Plato&#x27;s theory elicits even more questions about knowledge: If we can only learn something when we already had the knowledge impressed onto our souls, then how did our souls gain that knowledge in the first place? Plato&#x27;s theory can seem convoluted; however, his classical theory can still help us understand knowledge today.

====Locke====

John Locke (1632–1704) offered an answer to Plato&#x27;s question as well. Locke offered the &quot;blank slate&quot; theory where humans are born into the world with no innate knowledge and are ready to be written on and influenced by the environment. The thinker maintained that knowledge and ideas originate from two sources, which are sensation and reflection. The former provides insights regarding external objects (including their properties) while the latter provides the ideas about one&#x27;s mental faculties (volition and understanding). In the theory of empiricism, these sources are direct experience and observation. Locke, like David Hume, is considered an empiricist because he locates the source of human knowledge in the empirical world.

Locke recognized that something had to be present, however. This something, to Locke, seemed to be &quot;mental powers&quot;. Locke viewed these powers as a biological ability the baby is born with, similar to how a baby knows how to biologically function when born. So as soon as the baby enters the world, it immediately has experiences with its surroundings and all of those experiences are being transcribed to the baby&#x27;s &quot;slate&quot;. All of the experiences then eventually culminate into complex and abstract ideas. This theory can still help teachers understand their students&#x27; learning today.

==Educational psychology==
===Behavior analysis===

The term &quot;behaviorism&quot; was coined by American psychologist John Watson (1878–1959). Watson believed the behaviorist view is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science with a goal to predict and control behavior. In an article in the &quot;Psychological Review&quot;, he stated that, &quot;Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness.&quot;

Methodological behaviorism is based on the theory of only explaining public events, or observable behavior. B.F. Skinner introduced another type of behaviorism called radical behaviorism, or the conceptual analysis of behavior, which is based on the theory of also explaining private events; particularly, thinking and feelings. Radical behaviorism forms the conceptual piece of behavior analysis.

In behavior analysis, learning is the acquisition of a new behavior through conditioning and social learning.

====Learning and conditioning====
The three main types of conditioning and learning:
* Classical conditioning, where the behavior becomes a reflex response to an antecedent stimulus.
* Operant conditioning, where antecedent stimuli results from the consequences that follow the behavior through a reward (reinforcement) or a punishment.
* Social learning theory, where an observation of behavior is followed by modeling.

Ivan Pavlov discovered classical conditioning. He observed that if dogs come to associate the delivery of food with a white lab coat or the ringing of a bell, they produce saliva, even when there is no sight or smell of food. Classical conditioning considers this form of learning the same, whether in dogs or in humans. Operant conditioning reinforces this behavior with a reward or a punishment. A reward increases the likelihood of the behavior recurring, a punishment decreases its likelihood. Social learning theory observes behavior and is followed with modeling.

These three learning theories form the basis of applied behavior analysis, the application of behavior analysis, which uses analyzed antecedents, functional analysis, replacement behavior strategies, and often data collection and reinforcement to change behavior. The old practice was called behavior modification, which only used &quot;assumed&quot; antecedents and consequences to change behavior without acknowledging the conceptual analysis; analyzing the function of behavior and teaching of new behaviors that would serve the same function was never relevant in behavior modification.

Behaviorists view the learning process as a change in behavior, and arrange the environment to elicit desired responses through such devices as behavioral objectives, Competency-based learning, and skill development and training. Educational approaches such as Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, curriculum-based measurement, and direct instruction have emerged from this model.

====Transfer of learning====
Transfer of learning is the idea that what one learns in school somehow carries over to situations different from that particular time and that particular setting. Transfer was amongst the first phenomena tested in educational psychology. Edward Lee Thorndike was a pioneer in transfer research. He found that though transfer is extremely important for learning, it is a rarely occurring phenomenon. In fact, he held an experiment where he had the subjects estimate the size of a specific shape and then he would switch the shape. He found that the prior information did not help the subjects; instead it impeded their learning.

One explanation of why transfer does not occur often involves surface structure and deep structure. The surface structure is the way a problem is framed. The deep structure is the steps for the solution. For example, when a math story problem changes contexts from asking how much it costs to reseed a lawn to how much it costs to varnish a table, they have different surface structures, but the steps for getting the answers are the same. However, many people are more influenced by the surface structure. In reality, the surface structure is unimportant. Nonetheless, people are concerned with it because they believe that it provides background knowledge on how to do the problem. Consequently, this interferes with their understanding of the deep structure of the problem. Even if somebody tries to concentrate on the deep structure, transfer still may be unsuccessful because the deep structure is not usually obvious. Therefore, surface structure gets in the way of people&#x27;s ability to see the deep structure of the problem and transfer the knowledge they have learned to come up with a solution to a new problem.

Current learning pedagogies focus on conveying rote knowledge, independent of the context that gives it meaning. Because of this, students often struggle to transfer this stand-alone information into other aspects of their education. Students need much more than abstract concepts and self-contained knowledge; they need to be exposed to learning that is practiced in the context of authentic activity and culture. Critics of situated cognition, however, would argue that by discrediting stand-alone information, the transfer of knowledge across contextual boundaries becomes impossible. There must be a balance between situating knowledge while also grasping the deep structure of material, or the understanding of how one arrives to know such information.

Some theorists argue that transfer does not even occur at all. They believe that students transform what they have learned into the new context. They say that transfer is too much of a passive notion. They believe students, instead, transform their knowledge in an active way. Students don&#x27;t simply carry over knowledge from the classroom, but they construct the knowledge in a way that they can understand it themselves. The learner changes the information they have learned to make it best adapt to the changing contexts that they use the knowledge in. This transformation process can occur when a learner feels motivated to use the knowledge—however, if the student does not find the transformation necessary, it is less likely that the knowledge will ever transform.

====Techniques and benefits of transfer of learning====
There are many different conditions that influence transfer of learning in the classroom. These conditions include features of the task, features of the learner, features of the organization and social context of the activity. The features of the task include practicing through simulations, problem-based learning, and knowledge and skills for implementing new plans. The features of learners include their ability to reflect on past experiences, their ability to participate in group discussions, practice skills, and participate in written discussions. All the unique features contribute to a student&#x27;s ability to use transfer of learning. There are structural techniques that can aid learning transfer in the classroom. These structural strategies include hugging and bridging.

Hugging uses the technique of simulating an activity to encourage reflexive learning. An example of the hugging strategy is when a student practices teaching a lesson or when a student role plays with another student. These examples encourage critical thinking that engages the student and helps them understand what they are learning—one of the goals of transfer of learning and desirable difficulties.

Bridging is when instruction encourages thinking abstractly by helping to identify connections between ideas and to analyze those connections. An example is when a teacher lets the student analyze their past test results and the way they got those results. This includes amount of study time and study strategies. Looking at their past study strategies can help them come up with strategies to improve performance. These are some of the ideas important to successful to hugging and bridging practices.

There are many benefits of transfer of learning in the classroom. One of the main benefits is the ability to quickly learn a new task. This has many real-life applications such as language and speech processing. Transfer of learning is also very useful in teaching students to use higher cognitive thinking by applying their background knowledge to new situations.

===Cognitivism===
====Gestalt theory====
Cognitive theories grew out of Gestalt psychology. Gestalt psychology was developed in Germany in the early 1900s by Wolfgang Kohler and was brought to America in the 1920s. The German word &quot;Gestalt&quot; is roughly equivalent to the English &quot;emergence (of a form-as in the game pictionary, when all of a sudden one recognises what the person is trying to convey - the form and meaning &quot;emerge&quot;)&quot;, &quot;configuration&quot; or &quot;organization&quot; and emphasizes the whole of human experience. Over the years, the Gestalt psychologists provided demonstrations and described principles to explain the way we organize our sensations into perceptions. Max Wertheimer, one of the founding fathers of Gestalt Theory, observed that sometimes we interpret motion when there is no motion at all. For example: a powered sign used at a convenience store to indicate that the store is open or closed might be seen as a sign with &quot;constant light&quot;. However, the lights are actually flashing. Each light has been programmed to blink rapidly at their own individual pace. Perceived as a whole however, the sign appears fully lit without flashes. If perceived individually, the lights turn off and on at designated times. Another example of this would be a brick house: As a whole, it is viewed as a standing structure. However, it is actually composed of many smaller parts, which are individual bricks. People tend to see things from a holistic point of view rather than breaking it down into sub units.

In Gestalt theory, psychologists say that instead of obtaining knowledge from what&#x27;s in front of us, we often learn by making sense of the relationship between what&#x27;s new and old. Because we have a unique perspective of the world, humans have the ability to generate their own learning experiences and interpret information that may or may not be the same for someone else.

Gestalt psychologists criticize behaviorists for being too dependent on overt behavior to explain learning. They propose looking at the patterns rather than isolated events. Gestalt views of learning have been incorporated into what have come to be labeled &quot;cognitive theories&quot;. Two key assumptions underlie this cognitive approach: that the memory system is an active organized processor of information and that prior knowledge plays an important role in learning. Gestalt theorists believe that for learning to occur, prior knowledge must exist on the topic. When the learner applies their prior knowledge to the advanced topic, the learner can understand the meaning in the advanced topic, and learning can occur. Cognitive theories look beyond behavior to consider how human memory works to promote learning, and an understanding of short-term memory and long-term memory is important to educators influenced by cognitive theory. They view learning as an internal mental process (including insight, information processing, memory and perception) where the educator focuses on building intelligence and cognitive development. The individual learner is more important than the environment.

====Other cognitive theories====
Once memory theories like the Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model and Baddeley&#x27;s working memory model were established as a theoretical framework in cognitive psychology, new cognitive frameworks of learning began to emerge during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Today, researchers are concentrating on topics like cognitive load and information processing theory. These theories of learning play a role in influencing instructional design. Cognitive theory is used to explain such topics as social role acquisition, intelligence and memory as related to age.

In the late twentieth century, situated cognition emerged as a theory that recognized current learning as primarily the transfer of decontextualized and formal knowledge. Bredo (1994) depicts situated cognition as &quot;shifting the focus from individual in environment to individual and environment&quot;. In other words, individual cognition should be considered as intimately related with the context of social interactions and culturally constructed meaning. Learning through this perspective, in which knowing and doing become inseparable, becomes both applicable and whole.

Much of the education students receive is limited to the culture of schools, without consideration for authentic cultures outside of education. Curricula framed by situated cognition can bring knowledge to life by embedding the learned material within the culture students are familiar with. For example, formal and abstract syntax of math problems can be transformed by placing a traditional math problem within a practical story problem. This presents an opportunity to meet that appropriate balance between situated and transferable knowledge. Lampert (1987) successfully did this by having students explore mathematical concepts that are continuous with their background knowledge. She does so by using money, which all students are familiar with, and then develops the lesson to include more complex stories that allow for students to see various solutions as well as create their own. In this way, knowledge becomes active, evolving as students participate and negotiate their way through new situations.

===Constructivism===

Founded by Jean Piaget, constructivism emphasizes the importance of the active involvement of learners in constructing knowledge for themselves. Students are thought to use background knowledge and concepts to assist them in their acquisition of novel information. On approaching such new information, the learner faces a loss of equilibrium with their previous understanding, and this demands a change in cognitive structure. This change effectively combines previous and novel information to form an improved cognitive schema. Constructivism can be both subjectively and contextually based. Under the theory of radical constructivism, coined by Ernst von Glasersfeld, understanding relies on one&#x27;s subjective interpretation of experience as opposed to objective &quot;reality&quot;. Similarly, William Cobern&#x27;s idea of contextual constructivism encompasses the effects of culture and society on experience.

Constructivism asks why students do not learn deeply by listening to a teacher, or reading from a textbook. To design effective teaching environments, it believes one needs a good understanding of what children already know when they come into the classroom. The curriculum should be designed in a way that builds on the pupil&#x27;s background knowledge and is allowed to develop with them. Begin with complex problems and teach basic skills while solving these problems. The learning theories of John Dewey, Maria Montessori, and David A. Kolb serve as the foundation of the application of constructivist learning theory in the classroom. Constructivism has many varieties such as active learning, discovery learning, and knowledge building, but all versions promote a student&#x27;s free exploration within a given framework or structure. The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working answering open-ended questions and solving real-world problems. To do this, a teacher should encourage curiosity and discussion among his/her students as well as promoting their autonomy. In scientific areas in the classroom, constructivist teachers provide raw data and physical materials for the students to work with and analyze.

===Transformative learning theory===

Transformative learning theory seeks to explain how humans revise and reinterpret meaning. Transformative learning is the cognitive process of effecting change in a frame of reference. A frame of reference defines our view of the world. The emotions are often involved. Adults have a tendency to reject any ideas that do not correspond to their particular values, associations and concepts.

Our frames of reference are composed of two dimensions: habits of mind and points of view. Habits of mind, such as ethnocentrism, are harder to change than points of view. Habits of mind influence our point of view and the resulting thoughts or feelings associated with them, but points of view may change over time as a result of influences such as reflection, appropriation and feedback. Transformative learning takes place by discussing with others the &quot;reasons presented in support of competing interpretations, by critically examining evidence, arguments, and alternative points of view&quot;. When circumstances permit, transformative learners move toward a frame of reference that is more inclusive, discriminating, self-reflective, and integrative of experience.

==Educational neuroscience==

American Universities such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and University of Southern California began offering majors and degrees dedicated to educational neuroscience or neuroeducation in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Such studies seek to link an understanding of brain processes with classroom instruction and experiences. Neuroeducation analyzes biological changes in the brain from processing new information. It looks at what environmental, emotional, and social situations best help the brain store and retain new information via the linking of neurons—and best keep the dendrites from being reabsorbed, losing the information. The 1990s were designated &quot;The Decade of the Brain&quot;, and advances took place in neuroscience at an especially rapid pace. The three dominant methods for measuring brain activities are event-related potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography (MEG).

The integration and application to education of what we know about the brain was strengthened in 2000 when the American Federation of Teachers stated: &quot;It is vital that we identify what science tells us about how people learn in order to improve the education curriculum.&quot; What is exciting about this new field in education is that modern brain imaging techniques now make it possible, in some sense, to watch the brain as it learns, and the question then arises: can the results of neuro-scientific studies of brains as they are learning usefully inform practice in this area? The neuroscience field is young. Researchers expected that new technologies and ways of observing will produce new scientific evidence that helps refine the paradigms of what students need and how they learn best. In particular, it may bring more informed strategies for teaching students with learning disabilities.

===Formal and mental discipline===

All individuals have the ability to develop mental discipline and the skill of mindfulness, the two go hand in hand. Mental discipline is huge in shaping what people do, say, think and feel. It&#x27;s critical in terms of the processing of information and involves the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to new things and information people come across, or have recently been taught. Mindfulness is important to the process of learning in many aspects. Being mindful means to be present with and engaged in whatever you are doing at a specific moment in time. Being mindful can aid in helping us to more critically think, feel and understand the new information we are in the process of absorbing. 
The formal discipline approach seeks to develop causation between the advancement of the mind by exercising it through exposure to abstract school subjects such as science, language and mathematics. With student&#x27;s repetitive exposure to these particular subjects, some scholars feel that the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to science, language and math is of &quot;secondary importance&quot;, and believe that the strengthening and further development of the mind that this curriculum provides holds far greater significance to the progressing learner in the long haul. D.C. Phillips and Jonas F. Soltis provide some skepticism to this notion. Their skepticism stems largely in part from feeling that the relationship between formal discipline and the overall advancement of the mind is not as strong as some would say. They illustrate their skepticism by opining that it is foolish to blindly assume that people are better off in life, or at performing certain tasks, because of taking particular, yet unrelated courses.

==Multiple intelligences==

The existence of multiple intelligences is proposed by psychologist Howard Gardner, who suggests that different kinds of intelligence exists in human beings. It is a theory that has been fashionable in continuous professional development (CPD) training courses for teachers. However, the theory of multiple intelligences is often cited as an example of pseudoscience because it lacks empirical evidence or falsifiability.

==Multimedia learning==
Multimedia learning refers to the use of visual and auditory teaching materials that may include video, computer and other information technology. Multimedia learning theory focuses on the principles that determine the effective use of multimedia in learning, with emphasis on using both the visual and auditory channels for information processing.

The auditory channel deals with information that is heard, and the visual channel processes information that is seen. The visual channel holds less information than the auditory channel. If both the visual and auditory channels are presented with information, more knowledge is retained. However, if too much information is delivered it is inadequately processed, and long-term memory is not acquired. Multimedia learning seeks to give instructors the ability to stimulate both the visual and auditory channels of the learner, resulting in better progress.

===Using online games for learning===

Many educators and researchers believe that information technology could bring innovation on traditional educational instructions. Teachers and technologists are searching for new and innovative ways to design learner-centered learning environments effectively, trying to engage learners more in the learning process. Claims have been made that online games have the potential to teach, train and educate and they are effective means for learning skills and attitudes that are not so easy to learn by rote memorization.
There has been a lot of research done in identifying the learning effectiveness in game based learning. Learner characteristics and cognitive learning outcomes have been identified as the key factors in research on the implementation of games in educational settings. In the process of learning a language through an online game, there is a strong relationship between the learner&#x27;s prior knowledge of that language and their cognitive learning outcomes. For the people with prior knowledge of the language, the learning effectiveness of the games is much more than those with none or less knowledge of the language.

==Other learning theories==
Other learning theories have also been developed for more specific purposes. For example, andragogy is the art and science to help adults learn. Connectivism is a recent theory of networked learning, which focuses on learning as making connections. The Learning as a Network (LaaN) theory builds upon connectivism, complexity theory, and double-loop learning. It starts from the learner and views learning as the continuous creation of a personal knowledge network (PKN).

===Learning style theories===

Learning style theories propose that individuals learn in different ways, that there are distinct learning styles and that knowledge of a learner&#x27;s preferred learning style leads to faster and more satisfactory improvement. However, the current research has not been able to find solid scientific evidence to support the main premises of learning styles theory.

===Affective Context Model===
People remember how things made them feel, and use those emotional imprints to create memories on demand.

===Informal and post-modern theories===
In theories that make use of cognitive restructuring, an informal curriculum promotes the use of prior knowledge to help students gain a broad understanding of concepts. New knowledge cannot be told to students, it believes, but rather the students&#x27; current knowledge must be challenged. In this way, students adjust their ideas to more closely resemble actual theories or concepts. By using this method students gain the broad understanding they&#x27;re taught and later are more willing to learn and keep the specifics of the concept or theory. This theory further aligns with the idea that teaching the concepts and the language of a subject should be split into multiple steps.

Other informal learning theories look at the sources of motivation for learning. Intrinsic motivation may create a more self-regulated learner, yet schools undermine intrinsic motivation. Critics argue that the average student learning in isolation performs significantly less well than those learning with collaboration and mediation. Students learn through talk, discussion, and argumentation.

==Educational anthropology==
===Philosophical anthropology===

According to Theodora Polito, &quot;every well-constructed theory of education [has] at [its] center a philosophical anthropology,&quot; which is &quot;a philosophical reflection on some basic problems of mankind.&quot; Philosophical anthropology is an exploration of human nature and humanity. Aristotle, an early influence on the field, deemed human nature to be &quot;rational animality,&quot; wherein humans are closely related to other animals but still set apart by their ability to form rational thought. Philosophical anthropology expanded upon these ideas by clarifying that rationality is, &quot;determined by the biological and social conditions in which the lives of human beings are embedded.&quot; Fully developed learning theories address some of the &quot;basic problems of mankind&quot; by examining these biological and social conditions to understand and manipulate the rationality of humanity in the context of learning.

Philosophical anthropology is evident in behaviorism, which requires an understanding of humanity and human nature in order to assert that the similarities between humans and other animals are critical and influential to the process of learning. Situated cognition focuses on how humans interact with each other and their environments, which would be considered the &quot;social conditions&quot; explored within the field of philosophical anthropology. Transformative learning theories operate with the assumption that humans are rational creatures capable of examining and redefining perspectives, something that is heavily considered within philosophical anthropology.

An awareness and understanding of philosophical anthropology contributes to a greater comprehension and practice of any learning theory. In some cases, philosophy can be used to further explore and define uncertain terms within the field of education. Philosophy can also be a vehicle to explore the purpose of education, which can greatly influence an educational theory.

==Criticism==
Critics of learning theories that seek to displace traditional educational practices claim that there is no need for such theories; that the attempt to comprehend the process of learning through the construction of theories creates problems and inhibits personal freedom.

<text>Long-term memory (LTM) is the stage of the Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model in which informative knowledge is held indefinitely. It is defined in contrast to sensory memory, the initial stage, and short-term or working memory, the second stage, which persists for about 18 to 30 seconds. LTM is grouped into two categories known as explicit memory (declarative memory) and implicit memory (non-declarative memory). Explicit memory is broken down into episodic and semantic memory, while implicit memory includes procedural memory and emotional conditioning.

== Stores ==
The idea of separate memories for short- and long-term storage originated in the 19th century. One model of memory developed in the 1960s assumed that all memories are formed in one store and transfer to another store after a small period of time. This model is referred to as the &quot;modal model&quot;, most famously detailed by Shiffrin. The model states that memory is first stored in sensory memory, which has a large capacity but can only maintain information for milliseconds. A representation of that rapidly decaying memory is moved to short-term memory. Short-term memory does not have a large capacity like sensory memory but holds information for seconds or minutes. The final storage is long-term memory, which has a very large capacity and is capable of holding information possibly for a lifetime.

The exact mechanisms by which this transfer takes place, whether all or only some memories are retained permanently, and even to have the existence of a genuine distinction between stores, remain controversial.

===Evidence===

====Anterograde amnesia====
One form of evidence cited in favor of the existence of a short-term store comes from anterograde amnesia, the inability to learn new facts and episodes. Patients with this form of amnesia have an intact ability to retain small amounts of information over short time scales (up to 30 seconds) but have little ability to form longer-term memories (illustrated by patient HM). This is interpreted as showing that the short-term store is protected from damage and diseases.

====Distraction tasks====
Other evidence comes from experimental studies showing that some manipulations impair memory for the 3 to 5 most recently learned words of a list (it is presumed that they are held in short-term memory). Recall for words from earlier in the list (it is presumed, stored in long-term memory) are unaffected. Other manipulations (e.g., semantic similarity of the words) affect only memory for earlier list words, but do not affect memory for the most recent few words. These results show that different factors affect short-term recall (disruption of rehearsal) and long-term recall (semantic similarity). Together, these findings show that long-term memory and short-term memory can vary independently of each other.

===Models===

====Unitary model====
Not all researchers agree that short- and long-term memory are separate systems. The alternative Unitary Model proposes that short-term memory consists of temporary activations of long-term representations (that there is one memory that behaves variously over all time scales, from milliseconds to years). It has been difficult to identify a sharp boundary between short- and long-term memory. Eugen Tarnow, a physics researcher, reported that the recall probability versus latency curve is a straight line from 6 to 600 seconds, with the probability of failure to recall only saturating after 600 seconds. If two different stores were operating in this time domain, it is reasonable to expect a discontinuity in this curve. Other research has shown that the detailed pattern of recall errors looks remarkably similar to recall of a list immediately after learning (it is presumed, from short-term memory) and recall after 24 hours (necessarily from long-term memory).

Further evidence for a unified store comes from experiments involving continual distractor tasks. In 1974, Bjork and Whitten, psychology researchers, presented subjects with word pairs to remember; before and after each word pair, subjects performed a simple multiplication task for 12 seconds. After the final word-pair, subjects performed the multiplication distractor task for 20 seconds. They reported that the recency effect (the increased probability of recall of the last items studied) and the primacy effect (the increased probability of recall of the first few items) was sustained. These results are incompatible with a separate short-term memory as the distractor items should have displaced some of the word-pairs in the buffer, thereby weakening the associated strength of the items in long-term memory.

Ovid Tzeng (1973) reported an instance where the recency effect in free recall did not seem to result from a short-term memory store. Subjects were presented with four study-test periods of 10-word lists, with a continual distractor task (20-second period of counting-backward). At the end of each list, participants had to free recall as many words as possible. After recall of the fourth list, participants were asked to recall items from all four lists. Both the initial and final recall showed a recency effect. These results violated the predictions of a short-term memory model, where no recency effect would be expected.

Koppenaal and Glanzer (1990) attempted to explain these phenomena as a result of the subjects&#x27; adaptation to the distractor task, which allowed them to preserve at least some short-term memory capabilities. In their experiment, the long-term recency effect disappeared when the distractor after the last item differed from the distractors that preceded and followed the other items (e.g., arithmetic distractor task and word reading distractor task). Thapar and Greene challenged this theory. In one of their experiments, participants were given a different distractor task after every study item. According to Koppenaal and Glanzer&#x27;s theory, no recency effect would be expected as subjects would not have had time to adapt to the distractor; yet such a recency effect remained in place in the experiment.

====Another explanation====
One proposed explanation for recency in a continual distractor condition, and its disappearance in an end-only distractor task is the influence of contextual and distinctive processes. According to this model, recency is a result of the similarity of the final items&#x27; processing context to the processing context of the other items and the distinctive position of the final items versus intermediate items. In the end distractor task, the processing context of the final items is no longer similar to that of the other list items. At the same time, retrieval cues for these items are no longer as effective as without the distractor. Therefore, recency recedes or vanishes. However, when distractor tasks are placed before and after each item, recency returns, because all the list items have similar processing context.

==Dual-store memory model==
According to George Miller, whose paper in 1956 popularized the theory of the &quot;magic number seven&quot;, short-term memory is limited to a certain number of chunks of information, while long-term memory has a limitless store.

===Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model===
According to the dual store memory model proposed in 1968 by Richard C. Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin, memories can reside in the short-term &quot;buffer&quot; for a limited time while they are simultaneously strengthening their associations in LTM. When items are first presented, they enter short-term memory for approximately twenty to thirty seconds, but due to its limited space, as new items enter, older ones are pushed out. The limit of items that can be held in the short-term memory is an average between four and seven, yet, with practice and new skills that number can be increased. However, each time an item in short-term memory is rehearsed, it is strengthened in long-term memory. Similarly, the longer an item stays in short-term memory, the stronger its association becomes in long-term memory.

===Baddeley&#x27;s model of working memory===
In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch proposed an alternative theory of short-term memory, Baddeley&#x27;s model of working memory. According to this theory, short-term memory is divided into different slave systems for different types of input items, and there is an executive control supervising what items enter and exit those systems. The slave systems include the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer (later added by Baddeley).

==Encoding of information==
LTM encodes information semantically for storage, as researched by Baddeley. In vision, the information needs to enter working memory before it can be stored into LTM. This is evidenced by the fact that the speed with which information is stored into LTM is determined by the amount of information that can be fit, at each step, into visual working memory. In other words, the larger the capacity of working memory for certain stimuli, the faster will these materials be learned.

Synaptic consolidation is the process by which items are transferred from short- to long-term memory. Within the first minutes or hours after acquisition, the engram (memory trace) is encoded within synapses, becoming resistant (though not immune) to interference from outside sources.

As LTM is subject to fading in the natural forgetting process, maintenance rehearsal (several recalls/retrievals of memory) may be needed to preserve long-term memories. Individual retrievals can take place in increasing intervals in accordance with the principle of spaced repetition. This can happen quite naturally through reflection or deliberate recall (also known as recapitulation), often dependent on the perceived importance of the material. Using testing methods as a form of recall can lead to the testing effect, which aids long-term memory through information retrieval and feedback.

In LTM, brain cells fire in specific patterns. When someone experiences something in the world, the brain responds by creating a pattern of specific nerves firing in a specific way to represent the experience. This is called distributed representation. Distributed representation can be explained through a scientific calculator. At the top of the calculator is an opening in which the numbers typed in show up. This small slot is compiled by many blocks that light up to show a specific number. In that sense, certain blocks light up when prompted to show the number 4, but other blocks light up to show the number 5. There may be overlap in the blocks used, but ultimately, these blocks are able to generate different patterns for each specific situation. The encoding of specific episodic memories can be explained through distributed representation. When you try to remember an experience, perhaps your friend&#x27;s birthday party a year ago, your brain is activating a certain pattern of neurons. If you try to remember your mother&#x27;s birthday party, another pattern of neurons is fired but there may be overlap because they are both birthday parties. This kind of remembering is the idea of retrieval because it involves recalling the specific distributed representation created during the encoding of the experience.

===Sleep===
Some theories consider sleep to be an important factor in establishing well-organized long-term memories. &quot;(See also sleep and learning.)&quot; Sleep plays a key function in the consolidation of new memories.

According to Tarnow&#x27;s theory, long-term memories are stored in dream format (reminiscent of Penfield &amp; Rasmussen&#x27;s findings that electrical excitations of the cortex give rise to experiences similar to dreams). During waking life an executive function interprets LTM consistent with reality checking . It is further proposed in the theory that the information stored in memory, no matter how it was learned, can affect performance on a particular task without the subject being aware that this memory is being used. Newly acquired declarative memory traces are believed to be reactivated during NonREM sleep to promote their hippocampo-neocortical transfer for long-term storage. Specifically, new declarative memories are better remembered if recall follows Stage II non-rapid eye movement sleep. The reactivation of memories during sleep can lead to lasting synaptic changes within certain neural networks. It is the high spindle activity, low oscillation activity, and delta wave activity during NREM sleep that helps to contribute to declarative memory consolidation. In learning before sleep, spindles are redistributed to neuronally active up-states within slow oscillations during NREM sleep. Sleep spindles are thought to induce synaptic changes and thereby contribute to memory consolidation during sleep. Here, we examined the role of sleep in the object-place recognition task, a task closely comparable to tasks typically applied for testing human declarative memory: It is a one-trial task, hippocampus-dependent, not stressful and can be repeated within the same animal. Sleep deprivation reduces vigilance or arousal levels, affecting the efficiency of certain cognitive functions such as learning and memory.

The theory that sleep benefits memory retention is not a new idea. It has been around since Ebbinghaus&#x27;s experiment on forgetting in 1885. More recently studies have been done by Payne and colleagues and Holtz and colleagues. In Payne and colleague&#x27;s experiment participants were randomly selected and split into two groups. Both groups were given semantically related or unrelated word pairs, but one group was given the information at 9 A.M. and the other group received theirs at 9 P.M. Participants were then tested on the word pairs at one of three intervals 30 minutes, 12 hours, or 24 hours later. It was found that participants who had a period of sleep between the learning and testing sessions did better on the memory tests. This information is similar to other results found by previous experiments by Jenkins and Dallenbach (1924). It has also been found that many domains of declarative memory are affected by sleep such as emotional memory, semantic memory, and direct encoding.

Holtz found that not only does sleep affect consolidation of declarative memories, but also procedural memories. In this experiment, fifty adolescent participants were taught either word pairs (which represents declarative memory) and a finger tapping task (procedural memory) at one of two different times of day. What they found was that the procedural finger tapping task was best encoded and remembered directly before sleep, but the declarative word pairs task was better remembered and encoded if learned at 3 in the afternoon.

== Divisions ==
The brain does not store memories in one unified structure. Instead, different types of memory are stored in different regions of the brain. LTM is typically divided up into two major headings: explicit memory and implicit memory.

=== Explicit memory ===
Explicit memory (or declarative memory) refers to all memories that are consciously available. These are encoded by the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex, but consolidated and stored elsewhere. The precise location of storage is unknown, but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate. Research by Meulemans and Van der Linden (2003) found that amnesiac patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe performed more poorly on explicit learning tests than did healthy controls. However, these same amnesiac patients performed at the same rate as healthy controls on implicit learning tests. This implies that the medial temporal lobe is heavily involved in explicit learning, but not in implicit learning.

Declarative memory has three major subdivisions:

==== Episodic memory ====
Episodic memory refers to memory for specific events in time, as well as supporting their formation and retrieval. Some examples of episodic memory would be remembering someone&#x27;s name and what happened at your last interaction with each other. Experiments conducted by Spaniol and colleagues indicated that older adults have worse episodic memories than younger adults because episodic memory requires context dependent memory. It is said that episodic memories are not as detailed or accurate as people grow older in age. Some people may begin to have issues with identification or presentation related things as they age. They may not be able to recall things from their memory or have as good of a storage for details as they may have been able to do in the past. The Hippocampus is responsible for the functions of episodic memory and research suggests that the use of exercise can be effective in improving brain functions such as the episodic memory. According to Damien Moore and Paul D. Loprinzi, episodic memory can be improved using long-term potentiation, which is when synapses are made to be more durable with exercise. The durability and healthiness of the synapses will in time be able to pick up more connections with neurons and eventually help with episodic memory. Mnemonic training has also been proven to be effective with the sharpening of episodic memory. These trainings include things like the alphabet, music, numerical systems, and other learning systems. Studies by Shuyuan Chen and Zhihui Cai have shown that mnemonic training has shown to be able to improve episodic memory long term.

==== Semantic memory ====
Semantic memory refers to knowledge about factual information, such as the meaning of words. Semantic memory is independent information such as information remembered for a test. In contrast with episodic memory, older adults and younger adults do not show much of a difference in semantic memory, presumably because semantic memory does not depend on context memory.

==== Autobiographical memory ====
Autobiographical memory refers to knowledge about events and personal experiences from an individual&#x27;s own life. Autographical memories are facilitated by aids including verbal, face-evoked, picture-evoked, odour-evoked, and music-evoked autobiographical memory cues. Though similar to episodic memory, it differs in that it contains only those experiences which directly pertain to the individual, from across their lifespan. Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) argue that this is one component of the self-memory system.

=== Implicit memory ===
Implicit memory (procedural memory) refers to the use of objects or movements of the body, such as how exactly to use a pencil, drive a car, or ride a bicycle. This type of memory is encoded, and it is presumed stored by the striatum and other parts of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is believed to mediate procedural memory and other brain structures and is largely independent of the hippocampus. Research by Manelis, Hanson, and Hanson (2011) found that the reactivation of the parietal and occipital regions was associated with implicit memory. Procedural memory is considered non-declarative memory or unconscious memory which includes priming and non-associative learning.
The first part of nondeclarative memory (implicit memory) involves priming. Priming occurs when you do something faster after you have already done that activity, such as writing or using a fork.
Other categories of memory may also be relevant to the discussion of LTM. For example:

Emotional memory, the memory for events that evoke a particularly strong emotion, is a domain that can involve both declarative and procedural memory processes. Emotional memories are consciously available, but elicit a powerful, unconscious physiological reaction. Research indicates that the amygdala is extremely active during emotional situations and acts with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the encoding and consolidation of emotional events.

Working memory is not part of LTM but is important for it to function. Working memory holds and manipulates information for a short period of time, before it is either forgotten or encoded into LTM. Then, in order to remember something from LTM, it must be brought back into working memory. If working memory is overloaded, it can affect the encoding of LTM. If one has a good working memory, they may have a better LTM encoding.

==Disorders of memory==
Minor slips and lapses of memory are fairly commonplace and may increase naturally with age, when ill, or under stress. Some women may experience more memory lapses following the onset of the menopause.
In general, more serious problems with memory occur due to traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease.

===Traumatic brain injury===
The majority of findings on memory have been the result of studies that lesioned specific brain regions in rats or primates, but some of the most important work has been the result of accidental or inadvertent brain trauma. The most famous case in recent memory studies is the case study of HM, who had parts of his hippocampus, parahippocampal cortices, and surrounding tissue removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His subsequent total anterograde amnesia and partial retrograde amnesia provided the first evidence for the localization of memory function, and further clarified the differences between declarative and procedural memory.

===Neurodegenerative diseases===
Many neurodegenerative diseases can cause memory loss. Some of the most prevalent (and, as a consequence, most intensely researched) include Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, dementia, Huntington&#x27;s disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. None act specifically on memory; instead, memory loss is often a casualty of generalized neuronal deterioration. Currently, these illnesses are irreversible, but research into stem cells, psychopharmacology, and genetic engineering holds much promise.

Those with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease generally display symptoms such as getting momentarily lost on familiar routes, placing possessions in inappropriate locations, and distortions of existing memories or completely forgetting memories. Researchers have often used the Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm (DRM) to study the effects of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on memory. The DRM paradigm presents a list of words such as doze, pillow, bed, dream, nap, etc., but no theme word is presented. In this case, the theme word would have been &quot;sleep.&quot; Alzheimer&#x27;s disease patients are more likely to recall the theme word as being part of the original list than healthy adults. There is a possible link between longer encoding times and increased false memory in LTM. The patients end up relying on the gist of the information instead of the specific words themselves. Alzheimer&#x27;s disease leads to an uncontrolled inflammatory response brought on by extensive amyloid deposition in the brain, which leads to cell death in the brain. This gets worse over time and eventually leads to cognitive decline after the loss of memory. Pioglitazone may improve cognitive impairments, including memory loss, and may help protect long-term and visuospatial memory from neurodegenerative diseases.

Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients have problems with cognitive performance; these issues resemble those seen in frontal lobe patients and can often lead to dementia. It is thought that Parkinson&#x27;s disease is caused by degradation of the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic projection originating from the ventral tegmental area. It has also been indicated that the hippocampus plays an important role in episodic and spatial (parts of LTM) memory, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients have abnormal hippocampuses resulting in abnormal LTM functioning. L-dopa injections are often used to try to relieve Parkinson&#x27;s disease symptoms, as well as behavioral therapy.

Schizophrenia patients have trouble with attention and executive functions, which in turn affects LTM consolidation and retrieval. They cannot encode or retrieve temporal information properly, which causes them to select inappropriate social behaviors. They cannot effectively use the information they possess. The prefrontal cortex, where schizophrenia patients have structural abnormalities, is involved with the temporal lobe and also affects the hippocampus, which causes their difficulty in encoding and retrieving temporal information (including LTM).

==Biological underpinnings at the cellular level==
Long-term memory, unlike short-term memory, is dependent upon the synthesis of new proteins. This occurs within the cellular body, and concerns the particular transmitters, receptors, and new synapse pathways that reinforce the communicative strength between neurons. The production of new proteins devoted to synapse reinforcement is triggered after the release of certain signaling substances (such as calcium within hippocampal neurons) in the cell. In the case of hippocampal cells, this release is dependent upon the expulsion of magnesium (a binding molecule) that is expelled after significant and repetitive synaptic signaling. The temporary expulsion of magnesium frees NMDA receptors to release calcium in the cell, a signal that leads to gene transcription and the construction of reinforcing proteins. For more information, see long-term potentiation (LTP).

One of the newly synthesized proteins in LTP is also critical for maintaining LTM. This protein is an autonomously active form of the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC), known as PKMζ. PKMζ maintains the activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength and inhibiting PKMζ erases established long-term memories, without affecting short-term memory or, once the inhibitor is eliminated, the ability to encode and store new long-term memories is restored.

Also, BDNF is important for the persistence of long-term memories.

The long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as synaptic boutons, dendritic spines, and postsynaptic density.
On the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD-95 and HOMER1c has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement.

The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor which is believed to be important in consolidating short- to long-term memories, and which is believed to be downregulated in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===DNA methylation and demethylation===

Rats exposed to an intense learning event may retain a life-long memory of the event, even after a single training session. The LTM of such an event appears to be initially stored in the hippocampus, but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. When such an exposure was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one and at 24 hours after training. These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated, often due to the formation of new 5-methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore, many other genes were upregulated, likely often due to hypomethylation. Hypomethylation often results from the removal of methyl groups from previously existing 5-methylcytosines in DNA. Demethylation is carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including TET enzymes as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway (see Epigenetics in learning and memory). The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a LTM of the event.

==Contradictory evidence==
Some studies have yielded results that contradict the dual-store memory model. Studies showed that in spite of using distractors, there was still both a recency effect for a list of items and a contiguity effect.

Another study revealed that how long an item spends in short-term memory is not the key determinant in its strength in long-term memory. Instead, whether the participant actively tries to remember the item while elaborating on its meaning determines the strength of its store in LTM.

==Single-store memory model==
An alternative theory is that there is only one memory store with associations among items and their contexts. In this model, the context serves as a cue for retrieval, and the recency effect is greatly caused by the factor of context. Immediate and delayed free recall will have the same recency effect because the relative similarity of the contexts still exists. Also, the contiguity effect still occurs because contiguity also exists between similar contexts.

<text>Latin declension is the set of patterns according to which Latin words are declined—that is, have their endings altered to show grammatical case, number and gender. Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined (verbs are conjugated), and a given pattern is called a declension. There are five declensions, which are numbered and grouped by ending and grammatical gender. Each noun follows one of the five declensions, but some irregular nouns have exceptions.

Adjectives are of two kinds: those like &#x27;good&#x27; use first-declension endings for the feminine, and second-declension for masculine and neuter. Other adjectives such as belong to the third declension. There are no fourth- or fifth-declension adjectives.

Pronouns are also of two kinds, the personal pronouns such as &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;you ()&#x27;, which have their own irregular declension, and the third-person pronouns such as &#x27;this&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27; which can generally be used either as pronouns or adjectivally. These latter decline in a similar way to the first and second noun declensions, but there are differences; for example the genitive singular ends in &quot;-īus&quot; or &quot;-ius&quot; instead of &quot;-ī&quot; or &quot;-ae&quot; and the dative singular ends in &quot;-ī&quot;..

The cardinal numbers &#x27;one&#x27;, &#x27;two&#x27;, and &#x27;three&#x27; also have their own declensions (&quot;ūnus&quot; has genitive &quot;-īus&quot; and dative &quot;-ī&quot; like a pronoun). However, numeral adjectives such as &#x27;a pair, two each&#x27; decline like ordinary adjectives.

== Grammatical cases ==
A complete Latin noun declension consists of up to seven grammatical cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative. However, the locative is limited to a few nouns: generally names of cities, small islands and a few other words.

===Order of cases===
The Roman grammarian Aelius Donatus (4th century AD), whose work was used as standard throughout the Middle Ages, placed the cases in this order:
:&quot;There are six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative and ablative.&quot;

This order was based on the order used by earlier Greek grammarians, with the addition of the ablative, which does not exist in Greek. The names of the cases also were mostly translated from the Greek terms, such as from the Greek .

This traditional order was formerly used in England, such as in &quot;The School and University Eton Latin Grammar&quot; (1861). That order is still followed in most other European countries. Gildersleeve and Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Latin Grammar&quot; (1895) also follow this order. More recent Latin grammars published in the United States, such as Allen and Greenough&#x27;s &quot;New Latin Grammar&quot; (1903) and &quot;Wheelock&#x27;s Latin&quot; (first published in 1956) follow this order except they list the vocative last.

However, in Britain and countries influenced by Britain other than the United States, the Latin cases are usually given in the following order: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative. This order was introduced in Benjamin Hall Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Latin Primer&quot; (1866), with the aim of making tables of declensions easier to recite and memorise (the first three and the last two cases having identical forms in several declensions). It is also used in France and Belgium. In &quot;Rosa&quot; (1962), a song in French by the Belgian singer Jacques Brel, Brel sings the declension of &quot;rosa&quot; as , following the British order of cases.

===Syncretism===

Syncretism, where one form in a paradigm shares the ending of another form in the paradigm, is common in Latin. The following are the most notable patterns of syncretism:

====Gender-specific====
* For neuter nouns, the nominative, vocative, and accusative cases are identical. The nominative, vocative, and accusative plural almost always ends in &quot;-a&quot;. (Both of these features are inherited from Proto-Indo-European, and so no actual syncretism is known to have happened in the historical sense, since these cases of these nouns are not known to have ever been different in the first place.)

====Case-specific====
* The vocative form is always the same as the nominative in the plural, and usually the same as the nominative in the singular except for second-declension nouns ending in &quot;-us&quot; and a few nouns of Greek origin. For example, the vocative of the first-declension is .
* The genitive singular is the same as the nominative plural in first-, second-, and fourth-declension non-neuter Latin nouns.
* The dative singular is the same as the genitive singular in first- and fifth-declension pure Latin nouns.
* The dative is always the same as the ablative in the singular in the second declension, the third-declension full &quot;i&quot;-stems (i.e. neuter &quot;i&quot;-stems, adjectives), and fourth-declension neuters.
* The dative, ablative, and locative are always identical in the plural.
* The locative singular is identical to the genitive in the 1st and 2nd declensions; to the dative or ablative in the 3rd declension; to the ablative in the 5th declension.
* The nominative and accusative plurals are identical for all nouns of the 4th declension (in &quot;-ūs&quot;) and 5th declension (in &quot;-ēs&quot;), and for many nouns of the 3rd declension (in &quot;-ēs&quot;; but a distinct accusative plural in &quot;-īs&quot; can be used in Classical Latin for some i-stem nouns).

=== History of cases ===
Old Latin had essentially two patterns of endings. One pattern was shared by the first and second declensions, which derived from the Proto-Indo-European thematic declension. The other pattern was used by the third, fourth and fifth declensions, and derived from the athematic PIE declension.

== Nouns ==
There are two principal parts for Latin nouns: the nominative singular and the genitive singular. Each declension can be unequivocally identified by the ending of the genitive singular (-&quot;ae&quot;, -&quot;i&quot;, -&quot;is&quot;, -&quot;ūs&quot;, -&quot;ei&quot;). The stem of the noun can be identified by the form of the genitive singular as well.

There are five declensions for Latin nouns:

=== First declension (&quot;a&quot; stems) ===
Nouns of this declension usually end in &quot;-a&quot; in the nominative singular and are mostly feminine, e.g. (&#x27;road&#x27;) and (&#x27;water&#x27;). There is a small class of masculine exceptions generally referring to occupations, e.g. (&#x27;poet&#x27;), (&#x27;farmer&#x27;), (&#x27;auriga, charioteer&#x27;), (&#x27;pirate&#x27;) and (&#x27;sailor&#x27;).

The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is &quot;a&quot;. The nominative singular form consists of the stem and the ending &quot;-a&quot;, and the genitive singular form is the stem plus &quot;-ae&quot;.


The locative endings for the first declension are &quot;-ae&quot; (singular) and &quot;-īs&quot; (plural), similar to the genitive singular and ablative plural, as in &#x27; &#x27;in war&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;at Athens&#x27;.

==== First declension Greek nouns ====

The first declension also includes three types of Greek loanwords, derived from Ancient Greek&#x27;s alpha declension. They are declined irregularly in the singular, but sometimes treated as native Latin nouns, e.g. nominative (&#x27;athlete&#x27;) instead of the original &quot;athlētēs. Archaic (Homeric) first declension Greek nouns and adjectives had been formed in exactly the same way as in Latin: &quot;nephelēgeréta Zeus&quot; (&#x27;Zeus the cloud-gatherer&#x27;) had in classical Greek become &quot;nephelēgerétēs.

For full paradigm tables and more detailed information, see the Wiktionary appendix .

=== Second declension (&quot;o&quot; stems) ===
The second declension is a large group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine nouns like (&#x27;horse&#x27;) and (&#x27;boy&#x27;) and neuter nouns like (&#x27;fort&#x27;). There are several small groups of feminine exceptions, including names of gemstones, plants, trees, and some towns and cities.

In the nominative singular, most masculine nouns consist of the stem and the ending &quot;-us&quot;, although some end in &quot;-er&quot;, which is not necessarily attached to the complete stem. Neuter nouns generally have a nominative singular consisting of the stem and the ending &quot;-um&quot;. However, every second-declension noun has the ending &quot;-ī&quot; attached as a suffix to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is &quot;o&quot;.


The locative endings for the second declension are &quot;-ī&quot; (singular) and &quot;-īs&quot; (plural); &quot;at Corinth&quot;, &quot;at Milan&quot;, and &quot;at Philippi&quot;.

==== Second-declension &quot;-ius&quot; and &quot;-ium&quot; nouns ====
Nouns ending in &quot;-ius&quot; and &quot;-ium&quot; have a genitive singular in &quot;-ī&quot; in earlier Latin, which was regularized to &quot;-iī&quot; in the later language. Masculine nouns in &quot;-ius&quot; have a vocative singular in &quot;-ī&quot; at all stages. These forms in &quot;-ī&quot; are stressed on the same syllable as the nominative singular, sometimes in violation of the usual Latin stress rule. For example, the genitive and vocative singular &quot;Vergilī&quot; (from ) is pronounced &quot;Vergílī&quot;, with stress on the penult, even though it is short. In Old Latin, however, the vocative was declined regularly, using &quot;-ie&quot; instead, e.g. &quot;fīlie&quot; &quot;[O] son&quot;, archaic vocative of .

There is no contraction of &quot;-iī(s)&quot; in plural forms and in the locative.

In the older language, nouns ending with &quot;-vus&quot;, &quot;-quus&quot; and &quot;-vum&quot; take &quot;o&quot; rather than &quot;u&quot; in the nominative and accusative singular. For example, (&#x27;slave&#x27;) could be &quot;servos&quot;, accusative &quot;servom&quot;.

==== Second-declension &quot;-r&quot; nouns ====
Some masculine nouns of the second declension end in &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ir&quot; in the nominative singular. The declension of these nouns is identical to that of the regular second declension, except for the lack of suffix in the nominative and vocative singular.

Some (but not all) nouns in &quot;-er&quot; drop the &quot;e&quot; in the genitive and other cases. For example, (&#x27;father-in-law&#x27;) keeps its &quot;e&quot;. However, the noun (&#x27;(school)master&#x27;) drops its &quot;e&quot; in the genitive singular.

For declension tables of second-declension nouns, see the .

The vocative &quot;puere&quot; is found but only in Plautus. The genitive plural &quot;virum&quot; is found in poetry.

==== Second-declension Greek nouns ====

The second declension contains two types of masculine Greek nouns and one form of neuter Greek noun. These nouns are irregular only in the singular, as are their first-declension counterparts. Greek nouns in the second declension are derived from the Omicron declension.

Some Greek nouns may also be declined as normal Latin nouns. For example, can appear as &quot;theātrum&quot;.

==== Irregular forms ====

===== Deus =====
The inflection of (&#x27;god&#x27;) is irregular. The vocative singular of &quot;deus&quot; is not attested in Classical Latin. In Ecclesiastical Latin the vocative of &quot;Deus&quot; (&#x27;God&#x27;) is &quot;Deus&quot;.

In poetry, &quot;-um&quot; may substitute &quot;-ōrum&quot; as the genitive plural ending.

===== Virus =====
Three words, although second declension neuter, end in &quot;-us&quot;. These are &quot;common people, crowd&quot;, &quot;slime, poison&quot;, and (borrowed from Greek) &quot;sea&quot;.

The word means &quot;1. slimy liquid, slime; 2. poison, venom&quot;, denoting the venom of a snake. This Latin word is probably related to the Greek (&quot;ios&quot;) meaning &quot;venom&quot; or &quot;rust&quot; and the Sanskrit word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;toxic, poison&quot;.

Since in antiquity denoted something uncountable, it was a mass noun. Mass nouns pluralize only under special circumstances, hence the non-existence of plural forms in the texts.

In Neo-Latin, a plural form is necessary in order to express the modern concept of &#x27;viruses&#x27;, which leads to the following declension:


=== Third declension===
The third declension is the largest group of nouns. The nominative singular of these nouns may end in &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;-ī&quot;, &quot;-ō&quot;, &quot;-y&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;, &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-t&quot;, or &quot;-x&quot;. This group of nouns includes masculine, neuter, and feminine nouns.

====Consonant stems====
The stem of a consonant-stem noun may be found from the genitive case by removing the ending &quot;-is&quot;. For example, the stem of &#x27;peace&#x27; is &quot;pāc-,&quot; the stem of &#x27;river&#x27; is &quot;flūmin-&quot;, and the stem of &#x27;flower&#x27; is &quot;flōr-.&quot;

Masculine, feminine and neuter nouns often have their own special nominative singular endings. For instance, many masculine nouns end in &quot;-or&quot; (, &#x27;love&#x27;). Many feminine nouns end in &quot;-īx&quot; (, &#x27;phoenix&#x27;), and many neuter nouns end in &quot;-us&quot; with an &quot;r&quot; stem in the oblique cases ( &#x27;burden&#x27;; &#x27;time&#x27;).



The locative endings for the third declension are &quot;-ī&quot; or &quot;-e&quot; (singular) and &quot;-ibus&quot; (plural), as in &#x27;in the country&#x27; and &#x27;at Tralles&#x27;.

==== Third declension &quot;i&quot;-stem and mixed nouns ====
The third declension also has a set of nouns that are declined differently. They are called &quot;i&quot;-stems. &quot;i&quot;-stems are broken into two subcategories: pure and mixed. Pure &quot;i&quot;-stems are indicated by special neuter endings. Mixed &quot;i&quot;-stems are indicated by the double consonant rule. Stems indicated by the parisyllabic rule are usually mixed, occasionally pure.
;Masculine and feminine
:Parisyllabic rule: Some masculine and feminine third-declension &quot;i&quot;-stem nouns have the same number of syllables in the genitive and the nominative. For example: (&#x27;ship&#x27;); (&#x27;cloud&#x27;). The nominative ends in &quot;-is&quot; or &quot;-ēs&quot;.
:Double consonant rule: The rest of the masculine and feminine third-declension &quot;i&quot;-stem nouns have two consonants before the &quot;-is&quot; in the genitive singular. For example: (&#x27;part&#x27;).
;Neuter
:Special neuter ending: Neuter third-declension &quot;i&quot;-stems have no rule. However, all of them end in &quot;-al&quot;, &quot;-ar&quot; or &quot;-e&quot;. For example: (&#x27;animal&#x27;); (&#x27;spoon&#x27;); (&#x27;sea&#x27;).

The mixed declension is distinguished from the consonant type only by having &quot;-ium&quot; in the genitive plural (and occasionally &quot;-īs&quot; in the accusative plural). The pure declension is characterized by having &quot;-ī&quot; in the ablative singular, &quot;-ium&quot; in the genitive plural, &quot;-ia&quot; in the nominative and accusative plural neuter, and &quot;-im&quot; in the accusative singular masculine and feminine (however, adjectives have &quot;-em&quot;).

The accusative plural ending &quot;-īs&quot; is found in early Latin up to Virgil, but from the early empire onwards it was replaced by &quot;-ēs&quot;.

The accusative singular ending &quot;-im&quot; is found only in a few words: always in &#x27;cough&#x27;, &#x27;thirst&#x27;, &#x27;River Tiber&#x27;; usually in &#x27;axe&#x27;, &#x27;tower&#x27;, &#x27;poop&#x27;, &#x27;fever&#x27;; occasionally in &#x27;ship&#x27;. Most nouns, however, have accusative singular &quot;-em&quot;. The ending &quot;-im&quot; is not found in any adjectives, even those that have a separate feminine such as &#x27;swift&#x27; or &#x27;keen&#x27;, or in any masculine common nouns.

The ablative singular &quot;-ī&quot; is found in nouns which have &quot;-im&quot;, and also, optionally, in some other nouns, e.g. or &#x27;in the fire&#x27;.

There are two mixed-declension neuter nouns: (&#x27;heart&#x27;) and (&#x27;bone&#x27;). The mixed declension is also used in the plural-only adjective (&#x27;most&#x27;).



The rules for determining &quot;i&quot;-stems from non-&quot;i&quot;-stems and mixed &quot;i&quot;-stems are guidelines rather than rules: many words that might be expected to be &quot;i&quot;-stems according to the parisyllabic rule actually are not, such as (&#x27;dog&#x27;) or (&#x27;youth&#x27;), which have genitive plural &#x27;of dogs&#x27; and &#x27;of young men&#x27;. Likewise, (&#x27;father&#x27;), (&#x27;mother&#x27;), (&#x27;brother&#x27;), and (&#x27;parent&#x27;) violate the double-consonant rule. This fluidity even in Roman times resulted in much more uncertainty in Medieval Latin.

Some nouns in &quot;-tāt-&quot;, such as &#x27;city, community&#x27; can have either consonant-stem or &quot;i&quot;-stem genitive plural: or &#x27;of the cities&#x27;.

==== Peculiarities ====
In the third declension, there are four irregular nouns.

=== Fourth declension (&quot;u&quot; stems) ===
The fourth declension is a group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine words such as (&#x27;wave&#x27;) and (&#x27;port&#x27;) with a few feminine exceptions, including (&#x27;hand&#x27;) and (&#x27;house&#x27;). The fourth declension also includes several neuter nouns including (&#x27;knee&#x27;). Each noun has the ending &quot;-ūs&quot; as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is &quot;u&quot;, but the declension is otherwise very similar to the third-declension &quot;i&quot; stems.



* In the genitive singular, &quot;cornūs&quot; may in later times be replaced by &quot;cornū&quot;.

* The locative endings for the fourth declension are &quot;-ī&quot; (singular) and &quot;-ibus&quot; (plural); &quot;at [the] senate&quot;, &quot;at home&quot;.

====Domus====
 (&#x27;house, dwelling, building, home, native place, family, household, race&#x27;) is an irregular noun, mixing fourth and second declension nouns at the same time (especially in literature). However, in practice, it is generally declined as a regular &quot;-us&quot; stem fourth declension noun, except for ablative singular &quot;-ō&quot;, accusative plural &quot;-ōs&quot;, and the use of the locative.

=== Fifth declension (&quot;e&quot; stems) ===
The fifth declension is a small group of nouns consisting of mostly feminine nouns like (&#x27;affair, matter, thing&#x27;) and &quot;diēs, diēī&quot; (&#x27;day&#x27;; but in names of days).

Nouns ending in &quot;-iēs&quot; have long &quot;ēī&quot; in the dative and genitive, while nouns ending in a consonant + &quot;-ēs&quot; usually have short &quot;eī&quot; in these cases. Other forms of the genitive singular are also found, such as (&quot;Aeneid&quot; 1.636), (&quot;Georgic&quot; 1.208), (Ennius).

The locative ending of the fifth declension was &quot;-ē&quot; (singular only), identical to the ablative singular, as in (&#x27;today&#x27;).

== Pronouns ==

=== Personal pronouns ===
The first and second persons are irregular, and both pronouns are indeclinable for gender; and the third person reflexive pronoun sē, suī always refers back to the subject, regardless of whether the subject is singular or plural.

The genitive forms , , , , are used as complements in certain grammatical constructions, whereas , are used with a partitive meaning (&#x27;[one] of us&#x27;, &#x27;[one] of you&#x27;). To express possession, the possessive pronouns (essentially adjectives) , , , are used, declined in the first and second declensions to agree in number and case with the thing possessed, e.g. &#x27;my father&#x27;, &#x27;my mother&#x27;. The vocative singular masculine of is : &#x27;my dear Atticus&#x27;.

==== Possessive pronouns&#x27; declensions ====

The possessive adjective has an archaic variant, ; similar to . Vocative of is usually , and rarely also, like the nominative.
Usually, to show the ablative of accompaniment, would be added to the ablative form. However, with personal pronouns (first and second person), the reflexive and the interrogative, &quot;-cum&quot; is added onto the end of the ablative form. That is: &#x27;with me&#x27;, &#x27;with us&#x27;, &#x27;with you&#x27;, , and (sometimes ).

Pronouns have also an emphatic form bi using the suffix &quot;-met&quot; (, /, , ), used in all cases, except by the genitive plural forms.

In accusative case, the forms &quot;mēmē&quot; and &quot;tētē&quot; exist as emphatic, but they are not widely used.

 has a possessive adjective: , meaning &#x27;his/her/its/their own&#x27;:

: (Cicero)
:&quot;He had never seen his [own] father.&quot;

When &#x27;his&#x27; or &#x27;her&#x27; refers to someone else, not the subject, the genitive pronoun (as well as &quot;eōrum&quot; and &quot;eārum&quot;) &#x27;of him&#x27; is used instead of &quot;suus&quot;:
: (Cicero)
:&quot;He met Clodius in front of the latter&#x27;s farm.&quot;

Despite its resemblance to the possessive adjectives and , does not decline in agreement with the noun it refers to, in the way that an adjective would. For instance, &quot;his father&quot; in the accusative is (literally, &quot;father of him&quot;), not &quot;*eium&quot;, in contrast with the reflexive formation (&quot;his [own] father&quot;).

When one sentence is embedded inside another with a different subject, &quot;sē&quot; and &quot;suus&quot; can refer to either subject:
: (Nepos)
:&quot;The senators ... sent ambassadors to Bithynia, who were to ask the king not to keep their greatest enemy with him but hand him over to them.&quot;

For the third-person pronoun &#x27;he&#x27;, see below.

=== Demonstrative pronouns and adjectives ===

Relative, demonstrative and indefinite pronouns are generally declined like first and second declension adjectives, with the following differences:
* the nominatives are often irregular
* the genitive singular ends in &quot;-īus&quot; rather than &quot;-ae&quot; or &quot;-ī&quot;.
* the dative singular ends in &quot;-ī&quot;: rather than &quot;-ae&quot; or &quot;-ō&quot;.

These differences characterize the pronominal declension, and a few special adjectives ( &#x27;whole&#x27;, &#x27;alone&#x27;, &#x27;one&#x27;, &#x27;no&#x27;, &#x27;another&#x27;, &#x27;another [of two]&#x27;, etc.) are also declined according to this pattern.

All demonstrative, relative, and indefinite pronouns in Latin can also be used adjectivally, with some small differences; for example in the interrogative pronoun, &#x27;who?&#x27; and &#x27;what?&#x27; are usually used for the pronominal form, and &#x27;which?&#x27; for the adjectival form.

===Third person pronoun===
The weak demonstrative pronoun , , &#x27;that&#x27; also serves as the third person pronoun &#x27;he, she, it&#x27;:

This pronoun is also often used adjectivally, e.g. &quot;is homo&quot; &#x27;that man&#x27;, &quot;ea pecunia&quot; &#x27;that money&#x27;. It has no possessive adjective; the genitive is used instead: &quot;pater eius&quot; &#x27;his/her father&#x27;; &quot;pater eōrum&quot; &#x27;their father&#x27;.

=== Declension of &quot;īdem&quot; ===
The pronoun or pronominal adjective means &#x27;the same&#x27;. It is derived from &quot;is&quot; with the suffix &quot;-dem&quot;. However, some forms have been assimilated.

===Other demonstrative pronouns===


Similar in declension is &#x27;another&#x27;.

=== Intensive pronoun ===
=== Interrogative pronouns ===
The interrogative pronouns are used strictly for asking questions. They are distinct from the relative pronoun and the interrogative adjective (which is declined like the relative pronoun). Interrogative pronouns rarely occur in the plural. The plural interrogative pronouns are the same as the plural relative pronouns.
=== Relative pronouns ===

== Adjectives ==

=== First- and second-declension adjectives ===
First- and second-declension adjectives are inflected in the masculine, the feminine and the neuter; the masculine form typically ends in &quot;-us&quot; (although some end in &quot;-er&quot;, see below), the feminine form ends in &quot;-a&quot;, and the neuter form ends in &quot;-um&quot;. Therefore, some adjectives are given like .

Adjectives ending &quot;-ius&quot; use the vocative &quot;-ie&quot; (&quot;ēbrie&quot;, &quot;[O] drunk man&quot;, vocative of &quot;ēbrius&quot;), just as in Old Latin all &quot;-ius&quot; nouns did (&quot;fīlie&quot;, &quot;[O] son&quot;, archaic vocative of &quot;fīlius&quot;).

==== First- and second-declension &quot;-r&quot; adjectives ====
Some first- and second-declension adjectives&#x27; masculine forms end in &quot;-er&quot;. As with second-declension &quot;-r&quot; nouns, some adjectives retain the &quot;e&quot; throughout inflection, and some omit it. omits its &quot;e&quot; while keeps it.

==== First and second declension pronominal adjectives ====
Nine first and second declension pronominal adjectives are irregular in the genitive and the dative in all genders. They can be remembered by using the mnemonic acronym . They are:

* &#x27;any&#x27;;
* &#x27;no, none&#x27;;
* &#x27;which [of two], either&#x27;;
* &#x27;sole, alone&#x27;;
* &#x27;neither&#x27;;
* &#x27;another&#x27; (the genitive singular &quot;alīus&quot; is often replaced by &quot;alterīus&quot; or by &quot;aliēnus&quot; &#x27;of another&#x27;);
* &#x27;one&#x27;;
* &#x27;whole&#x27;;
* &#x27;other [of two]&#x27;.
=== Third-declension adjectives ===
Third-declension adjectives are normally declined like third-declension &quot;i&quot;-stem nouns, except for the fact they usually have &quot;-ī&quot; rather than &quot;-e&quot; in the ablative singular (unlike &quot;i&quot;-stem nouns, in which only pure i-stems have &quot;-ī&quot;). Some adjectives, however, like the one-ending (&#x27;old, aged&#x27;), have &quot;-e&quot; in the ablative singular, &quot;-um&quot; in the genitive plural, and &quot;-a&quot; in the nominative and accusative neuter plural.

====Third-declension adjectives with one ending====
These have a single nominative ending for all genders, although as usual the endings for the other cases vary. As with nouns, a genitive is given for the purpose of showing the inflection.

=====Non-&quot;i&quot;-stem variant=====
==== Third-declension adjectives with two endings ====
Third-declension adjectives that have two endings have one form for the masculine and feminine, and a separate form for the neuter. The ending for the masculine and feminine is &quot;-is&quot;, and the ending for the neuter is &quot;-e&quot;. It is not necessary to give the genitive, as it is the same as the nominative masculine singular.
==== Third-declension adjectives with three endings ====
Third-declension adjectives with three endings have three separate nominative forms for all three genders. Like third and second declension &quot;-r&quot; nouns, the masculine ends in &quot;-er&quot;. The feminine ends in &quot;-ris&quot;, and the neuter ends in &quot;-re&quot;. The genitive is the same as the nominative feminine singular.


=== Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives ===
As in English, adjectives have superlative and comparative forms. For regular first and second declension and third declension adjectives with one or two endings, the comparative is formed by adding &quot;-ior&quot; for the masculine and feminine, and &quot;-ius&quot; for the neuter to the stem. The genitives for both are formed by adding &quot;-iōris&quot;. Therefore, they are declined in the third declension, but they are not declined as &quot;i&quot;-stems. Superlatives are formed by adding &quot;-issimus, -issima, -issimum&quot; to the stem and are thus declined like first and second declension adjectives.

====General pattern for comparatives====

====Comparatives and superlatives with normal endings====
==== Comparatives and superlatives of &quot;-er&quot; adjectives ====
Adjectives (in the first and second as well as third declensions) that have masculine nominative singular forms ending in &quot;-er&quot; are slightly different. As with normal adjectives, the comparative is formed by adding &quot;-ior&quot; to the stem, but for the superlative, &quot;-rimus&quot; is added to the nominative masculine singular.

==== Comparatives and superlatives of &quot;-lis&quot; adjectives ====
Some third declension adjectives with two endings in &quot;-lis&quot; in the masculine–feminine nominative singular have irregular superlative forms. The following are the only adjectives that do.

==== Comparatives and superlatives of &quot;-eus/-ius&quot; adjectives ====
First and second declension adjectives that end in &quot;-eus&quot; or &quot;-ius&quot; are unusual in that they do not form the comparative and superlative by taking endings at all. Instead, (&#x27;more&#x27;) and (&#x27;most&#x27;), the comparative and superlative degrees of (&#x27;much, greatly&#x27;), respectively, are used.

Many adjectives in &quot;-uus&quot;, except those in &quot;-quus&quot; or &quot;-guus&quot;, also follow this rule.

==== Irregular comparatives and superlatives ====
As in most languages, Latin has adjectives that have irregular comparatives and superlatives.


=== Declension of numerals ===
There are several different kinds of numeral words in Latin: the two most common are cardinal numerals and ordinal numerals. There are also several more rare numerals, e.g., distributive numerals and adverbial numerals.

==== Cardinal numerals ====
All cardinal numerals are indeclinable, except (&#x27;one&#x27;), (&#x27;two&#x27;), (&#x27;three&#x27;), plural hundreds (&#x27;two hundred&#x27;), (&#x27;three hundred&#x27;) etc., and (&#x27;thousand&#x27;), which have cases and genders like adjectives. is declined like a first- and second-declension pronoun with &quot;-īus&quot; or &quot;-ius&quot; in the genitive, and &quot;-ī&quot; in the dative. is declined irregularly, is declined like a third-declension plural adjective, &quot;-centī&quot; (&#x27;hundred&#x27;) numerals decline like first- and second-declension adjectives, and is invariable in the singular and declined like a third-declension &quot;i&quot;-stem neuter noun in the plural:

The plural endings for &quot;ūnus&quot; are used with &quot;plūrālia tantum&quot; nouns, e. g. &quot;ūna castra&quot; (one [military] camp), &quot;ūnae scālae&quot; (one ladder).
The word (&#x27;both&#x27;), is declined like &quot;duo&quot; except that its &quot;o&quot; is long. Both declensions derive from the Indo-European dual number, otherwise defunct in Latin, rather than the plural.

The numeral (&#x27;one hundred&#x27;) is indeclinable, but all the other hundred numerals are declinable (, , , , , , , ).

The word &quot;mīlle&quot; &#x27;thousand&#x27; is a singular indeclinable adjective. However, its plural, &quot;mīlia&quot;, is a plural third-declension &quot;i&quot;-stem neuter noun. To write the phrase &quot;four thousand horses&quot; in Latin, the genitive is used: &quot;quattuor mīlia equōrum&quot;, literally, &quot;four thousands of horses&quot;.

The rest of the numbers are indeclinable whether used as adjectives or as nouns.

For further information on the different sets of Latin numerals, see Latin numerals (linguistics).

== Adverbs and their comparatives and superlatives ==
Adverbs are not declined. However, adverbs must be formed if one wants to make an adjective into an adverb.

=== Adverbs from first- and second-declension adjectives ===
First and second declension adjectives&#x27; adverbs are formed by adding &quot;-ē&quot; onto their stems.
=== Adverbs from third declension adjectives ===
Typically, third declension adjectives&#x27; adverbs are formed by adding &quot;-iter&quot; to the stem. However, most third declension adjectives with one ending simply add &quot;-er&quot; to the stem.

=== Comparative and superlative of adverbs ===
Adverbs&#x27; comparative forms are identical to the nominative neuter singular of the corresponding comparative adjective. Adverbs&#x27; superlative forms are simply formed by attaching the regular ending &quot;-ē&quot; to the corresponding superlative adjective. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, first and second declensions adjectives ending in &quot;-eus&quot; or &quot;-ius&quot; use and as opposed to distinct endings.

=== Irregular adverbs and their comparative and superlative forms ===
As with adjectives, there are irregular adverbs with peculiar comparative and superlative forms.

== Peculiarities within declension ==

=== Irregularity in number ===
Some nouns are only used in the singular (singulare tantum) such as:
* materials, such as &#x27;gold&#x27;
Some nouns are only used in the plural (plurale tantum), or when plural have a singular meaning such as:
* many festivals, such as &#x27;Saturnalia&#x27;
* &#x27;camp&#x27; and &#x27;arms&#x27;; &#x27;a letter&#x27; (cf. &#x27;letter of the alphabet&#x27;)
* a few geographical names are plural such as &#x27;Thebes&#x27; (both the Greek and the Egyptian cities)

=== Indeclinable nouns ===
Indeclinable nouns are nouns which only have one form in all cases (of the singular).
* (&#x27;divine law&#x27;)
* (&#x27;likeness&#x27;)
* (&#x27;morning&#x27;)
* (&#x27;sin, abomination&#x27;)
* (&#x27;(male or female) sex&#x27;)

=== Heterogeneous nouns ===
Heterogeneous nouns are nouns which vary in respect to gender.

* A few nouns in the second declension occur in both the neuter and masculine. However, their meanings remain the same.
* Some nouns are one gender in the singular, but become another gender in the plural. They may also change in meaning.

<text>This is a list of Latin words with derivatives in English language. 

Ancient orthography did not distinguish between &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; or between &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;. Many modern works distinguish &quot;u&quot; from &quot;v&quot; but not &quot;i&quot; from &quot;j&quot;. In this article, both distinctions are shown as they are helpful when tracing the origin of English words. See also Latin phonology and orthography.

==Nouns and adjectives==
The citation form for nouns (the form normally shown in Latin dictionaries) is the Latin nominative singular, but that typically does not exhibit the root form from which English nouns are generally derived.

<doc id="17999" wikidata="Q1234399" url="?curid=17999" title="Latin phonology and orthography">
<text>Latin phonology is the system of sounds used in various kinds of Latin. This article largely deals with what features can be deduced for Classical Latin as it was spoken by the educated from the late Roman Republic to the early Empire. Evidence comes in the form of comments from Roman grammarians, common spelling mistakes, transcriptions into other languages, and the outcomes of various sounds in the Romance languages.

Latin orthography refers to the writing system used to spell Latin from its archaic stages down to the present. Latin was nearly always spelt in the Latin alphabet, but further details varied from period to period. The alphabet developed from Old Italic script, which had developed from a variant of the Greek alphabet, which had developed from a variant of the Phoenician alphabet. The Latin alphabet most resembles the Greek alphabet that can be seen on black-figure pottery dating to c. 540 BC, especially the Euboean regional variant.

As the language continued to be used as a classical language, lingua franca and liturgical language long after it ceased being a native language, pronunciation and – to a lesser extent – spelling diverged significantly from the classical standard with Latin words being pronounced differently by native speakers of different languages. While nowadays a reconstructed classical pronunciation aimed to be that of the 1st century AD is usually employed in the teaching of Latin, the Italian-influenced ecclesiastical pronunciation as used by the Catholic church is still in common use. The Traditional English pronunciation of Latin has all but disappeared from classics education but continues to be used for Latin-based loanwords and use of Latin e.g. for binominal names in taxonomy.

During most of the time written Latin was in widespread use, authors variously complained about language change or attempted to &quot;restore&quot; an earlier standard. Such sources are of great value in reconstructing various stages of the spoken language (the is an important source for the spoken variety in the 4th century CE, for example) and have in some cases indeed influenced the development of the language. The efforts of Renaissance Latin authors were to a large extent successful in removing innovations in grammar, spelling and vocabulary present in Medieval Latin but absent in both classical and contemporary Latin.

==Letterforms==
In Classical times there was no modern-like distinction between upper case and lower case. Inscriptions typically use square capitals, in letterforms largely corresponding to modern upper-case, and handwritten text was generally in the form of cursive, which includes letterforms corresponding to modern lowercase.

==Letters and phonemes==
In Classical spelling, individual letters mainly corresponded to individual phonemes (alphabetic principle). Exceptions include:
# The letters , , , , and , each of which could represent either a short vowel or a long one. The long vowels were sometimes marked with apices, as in , , , and , while long could be marked with long I . Since the 19th century, long vowels have been marked with macrons, as in , , , , and ; sometimes, breves may also be used to indicate short vowels, as in , , , , , and .
# The letters and , which could either indicate vowels (as mentioned) or the consonants and , respectively. In modern times, the letters and began to be used as distinct spellings for these consonants (now often pronounced very differently).
# Digraphs such as , and , which represented the diphthongs , and . In a few words, these could also stand for sequences of two adjacent vowels, which is sometimes marked by the use of a diaeresis in modern transcriptions, as in , and .
# The digraphs , and , standing for the aspirated consonants , and .

===Consonants===
Below are the distinctive (i.e. phonemic) consonants that are assumed for Classical Latin. Those placed in brackets have a debated phonemic status, and those preceded by a dagger (†) are found mainly or only in Greek loanwords.

====Phonetics====
* Latin may have had the labialized velar stops and as opposed to the stop + semivowel sequences and (as in the English &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;penguin&quot;). The argument for is stronger than that for .
* The former could occur between vowels, where it always counted as a single consonant in Classical poetry, whereas the latter only occurred after , where it is impossible to tell whether it counted as one consonant or two. The labial element, whether or , appears to have been palatalised before a front vowel, resulting in or (for instance would have sounded something like ). This palatalisation did not affect the independent consonant before front vowels.
* and before were not distinct from and , which were allophonically labialized to and by a following such that writing a double was unnecessary. This is suggested by the fact that and (from Old Latin and ) are also found spelt as and .
* , and were less aspirated than the corresponding English consonants, as implied by their usually being transliterated into Ancient Greek as , and , and their pronunciation in most Romance languages. In many cases, however, it was not the Latin and , but rather and , that were used to render Greek word-initial and in borrowings (as in , &gt; , ), especially borrowings of a non-learned character. This might suggest that the Latin and had some degree of aspiration, making and more suitable to approximate the Greek sounds.
* , and were pronounced with notable aspiration, like the initial consonants of the English pot&quot;, top&quot;, and &quot;cot&quot; respectively. They are attested beginning c. 150 BC, in the spellings , and , at first only used to render the Greek , and in loanwords. (Previously these had been rendered in Latin as , and .) From c. 100 BC onward , and spread to a number of native Latin words as well, such as and . When this occurred it was nearly always in the vicinity of the consonant or , and the implication is that Latin , and had become aspirated in that context.
* was found as a rendering of the Greek in borrowings starting around the first century BC. (In earlier borrowings, the Greek sound had been rendered in Latin as .) In initial position this appears to have been pronounced , and between vowels it appears to have been doubled to (counted as two consonants in poetry).
* was unvoiced in all positions in Classical Latin. Previously however Old Latin appears to have voiced to between vowels, ultimately turning to . Cicero reports the family-name being changed to in the fourth century BC, which may give some idea of the chronology. Afterward new instances of developed between vowels from sound-changes like the degemination of after long vowels and diphthongs (as in &gt; ), which Quintilian reports to have happened a little after the time of Cicero and Virgil.
*In Old Latin, final after a short vowel was often lost, probably after first debuccalizing to , as in the inscriptional form for (Classical ). Often in the poetry of Plautus, Ennius, and Lucretius, final did not count as a consonant when followed by a word beginning with a consonant. By the Classical period this practice was described as characteristic of non-urban speech by Cicero.
* was labiodental in Classical Latin but may have been a bilabial in Old Latin, or perhaps in free variation with . Lloyd, Sturtevant, and Kent make this argument based on misspellings in early inscriptions, the fact that many instances of Latin descend from Proto-Indo-European *, and the outcomes of the sound in Romance (particularly in Spain).
* In most cases was pronounced as a bilabial nasal. At the end of a word, however, it was generally lost beginning in Old Latin (except when another nasal or a plosive followed it), leaving compensatory lengthening and nasalization on the preceding vowel (such that may have sounded something like , i.e. ). In Old Latin inscriptions, final is often omitted, as in for (Classical ). It was frequently elided before a following vowel in poetry and lost without a trace (apart from perhaps lengthening) in the Romance languages, except in a number of monosyllabic words, where it often survives as or a further development thereof.
* and merged via assimilation before a following consonant, with the following consonant determining the resulting pronunciation: bilabial before a bilabial consonant (e.g. and ), coronal before a coronal consonant (e.g. and ) and velar before a velar consonant (e.g. , and ). This occurred both within words (e.g. may have sounded something like ) and across word-boundaries (for instance with , or ).
* assimilated to a velar nasal before . Allen and Greenough say that a vowel before is always long, but W. Sidney Allen says that is based on an interpolation in Priscian, and the vowel was actually long or short depending on the root, as for example from the root of but from the root of . probably did not assimilate to before . The cluster arose by syncope, as for example from . Original developed into in , from the root of . At the start of a word, original was reduced to , and this change was reflected in the orthography of later texts, as in , &gt; , .
* In Classical Latin, the rhotic was most likely an alveolar trill in some positions and when doubled. Gaius Lucilius likened it to the sound of a dog, and later writers described it as being produced by vibration. was sometimes written as , possibly suggesting a tap (like the single in Spanish).
* was strongly velarized in syllable coda and probably somewhat palatalized when geminated or followed by . In intervocalic position, it appears to have been velarized before all vowels except .

Between vowels, it was generally as a geminate , as in (pronounced something like ) except in compound words such as . This is sometimes marked in modern editions by a circumflex on the preceding vowel, e.g. , , , etc. could also have varied with in the same morpheme, as in and , and in poetry one could be replaced with the other for metrical purpose.
* was pronounced as an approximant until the first century AD, when and intervocalic began to develop into fricatives. In poetry, and could be replaced with each other, as in ~ or ~. Unlike it remained a single consonant in most words, e.g. in , although it did represent a double in borrowings from Greek such as the name .
* was generally still pronounced in Classical Latin, at least by educated speakers, but in many cases it appears to have been lost early on between vowels, and sometimes in other contexts as well ( &lt; * being a particularly early example). Where intervocalic survived, it was likely voiced (that is, ).

====Notes on spelling====
* Doubled consonant letters represented genuinely doubled consonants, as in for . In Old Latin, geminate consonants were written as if they were single until the middle of the second century BC, when orthographic doubling began to appear. Grammarians mention the marking of double consonants with the sicilicus, a diacritic in the shape of a sickle. It appears in a few inscriptions of the Augustan era.
* and both represented , whereas represented . and distinguish minimal pairs such as and . In Classical Latin appeared in only a few words like , - which could also be spelt , .
* represented . It was borrowed from the Western Greek alphabet, where chi stood for as well. This was unlike the usage of chi in the Ionic alphabet, where it stood for , with instead represented by the letter xi .
* and were also used to spell in Old Latin, but by the Classical period, was reserved for words containing the prefix combined with a base starting with (e.g. ).
* In Old Latin inscriptions, and were not distinguished. They were both represented by before and , by before and , and by before consonants or . The letterform derives from the Greek gamma , which represented . Its use for may come from Etruscan, which did not distinguish voiced plosives from voiceless ones. In Classical Latin, represented only in the abbreviations and , for and respectively.
* was created in the third century BC to distinguish from . Its letterform derived from with the addition of a diacritic or stroke. Plutarch attributes this innovation to Spurius Carvilius Ruga around 230 BC, but it may have originated with Appius Claudius Caecus in the fourth century BC.
* The cluster probably represented the consonant cluster , at least between vowels, as in . Vowels before this cluster were sometimes long and sometimes short.
* The digraphs , , and represented the aspirated plosives , and . They began to be used in writing around 150 BC, primarily as a transcription of Greek phi , theta , and chi , as in , , and . Some native words were later also written with these digraphs, such as , , , , probably representing aspirated allophones of the voiceless plosives near and . Aspirated plosives and the glottal fricative were also used hypercorrectively, an affectation satirized in .

It indicates not that the vowel is long but that the first syllable is heavy from the double consonant.
* between vowels represented single in native Latin words but double in Greek loanwords. Both the consonantal and vocalic pronunciations of sometimes occurred in similar environments, as in and .

===Vowels===

====Monophthongs====

Classical Latin had ten native phonemic monophthongs: the five short vowels , , , and , and their long counterparts , , , and . Two additional monophthongs, and , were sometimes used for in loanwords from Greek by educated speakers, but most speakers would have approximated them with or .

====Long and short vowels====
The short vowels , , and appear to have been pronounced with a relatively open quality, which may be approximated as , and the corresponding long vowels with a relatively close quality, approximately . That the short and were, as this implies, similar in quality to the long and is suggested by attested misspellings such as:
* for 
* for 
* for 
* for 

 most likely had a more open allophone before .

 and were probably pronounced closer when they occurred before another vowel, with e.g. written as in some inscriptions. Short before another vowel is often written with the so-called long I, as in for , indicating that its quality was similar to that of long ; it was almost never confused with in this position.

====Adoption of Greek upsilon====
 was used in Greek loanwords with upsilon . This letter represented the close front rounded vowel, both short and long: and . Latin did not have this sound as a native phoneme, and speakers tended to pronounce such loanwords with and in Old Latin and and in Classical and Late Latin if they were unable to produce and .
An intermediate vowel sound (likely a close central vowel or possibly its rounded counterpart ), called , can be reconstructed for the classical period. Such a vowel is found in , , (also spelled , , ) and other words. It developed out of a historical short , later fronted by vowel reduction. In the vicinity of labial consonants, this sound was not as fronted and may have retained some rounding, thus being more similar if not identical to the unreduced short . The Claudian letter Ⱶ ⱶ was possibly invented to represent this sound, but is never actually found used this way in the epigraphic record (it usually served as a replacement for the upsilon).

====Vowel nasalization====

Vowels followed by a nasal consonant were allophonically realised as long nasal vowels in two environments:
* Before word-final :
** &gt; 
* Before nasal consonants followed by a fricative:
** &gt; (in early inscriptions, often written as )
** &gt; (often written as and abbreviated as )
** &gt; (written as )
Those long nasal vowels had the same quality as ordinary long vowels. In Vulgar Latin, the vowels lost their nasalisation, and they merged with the long vowels (which were themselves shortened by that time). This is shown by many forms in the Romance languages, such as Spanish from Vulgar Latin (originally ) and Italian from Vulgar Latin (Classical Latin ). On the other hand, the short vowel and were restored, for example, in French and from and ( is the normal development of Latin short ), likely by analogy with other forms beginning in the prefix {{langin-&quot;.

When a final {{angbr|m}} occurred before a plosive or nasal in the next word, however, it was pronounced as a nasal at the place of articulation of the following consonant. For instance, {{lang|la|tan dūrum}} {{IPA|[tan ˈduː.rũː]}} was written for {{lang|la|tam dūrum}} in inscriptions, and {{lang|la|cum nōbīs}} {{IPA|[kʊn ˈnoː.biːs]}} was a double entendre, presumably for {{lang|la|cunnō bis}} {{IPA|[ˈkʊnnoː bɪs]}}.

====Diphthongs====

{{angbr|ae}}, {{angbr|oe}}, {{angbr|au}}, {{angbr|ei}} and {{angbr|eu}} could represent diphthongs: {{angbr|ae}} represented {{IPA|/ae̯/}}, {{angbr|oe}} represented {{IPA|/oe̯/}}, {{angbr|au}} represented {{IPA|/au̯/}}, {{angbr|ei}} represented {{IPA|/ei̯/}}, and {{angbr|eu}} represented {{IPA|/eu̯/}}. {{angbr|ui}} sometimes represented the diphthong {{IPA|/ui̯/}}, as in {{lang|la|cui}} {{audio|La-cls-cui.oga|listen}} and {{lang|la|huic}}. The diphthong {{angbr|ei}} had mostly changed to {{angbr|ī}} by the Classical epoch; {{angbr|ei}} remained only in a few words, such as the interjection {{lang|la|hei}}.

If there is a tréma above the second vowel, both vowels are pronounced separately: {{angbr|aë}} {{IPA|[ä.ɛ]}}, {{angbr|aü}} {{IPA|[a.ʊ]}}, {{angbr|eü}} {{IPA|[e.ʊ]}} and {{angbr|oë}} {{IPA|[ɔ.ɛ]}}. However, disyllabic {{angbr|eu}} in morpheme borders is traditionally written without the tréma: {{lang|la|meus}} {{IPA|[ˈme.ʊs]}} &#x27;my&#x27;.

In Old Latin, {{angbr|ae}} and {{angbr|oe}} were written as {{angbr|ai}}, {{angbr|oi}} and probably pronounced as {{IPA|[äi̯]}} and {{IPA|[oi̯]}}, with a fully closed second element, similar to the final syllable in French {{Audio|Fr-travail.ogg|&quot;travail&quot;}}. In the late Old Latin period, the last element of the diphthongs was lowered to {{IPA|[e]}}, so that the diphthongs were pronounced {{IPA|[äe̯]}} and {{IPA|[oe̯]}} in Classical Latin. They were then monophthongized to {{IPA|[ɛː]}} and {{IPA|[eː]}} respectively, starting in rural areas at the end of the Republican period.{{efn|The simplification was already common in rural speech as far back as the time of Varro (116 BC – 27 BC): cf. &quot;De lingua Latina&quot;, 5:97 (referred to in {{Harvnb|Smith|2004|p=47}}).}} The process, however, does not seem to have been completed before the 3rd century AD, and some scholars say that it may have been regular by the 5th century.

===Vowel and consonant length===
Vowel and consonant length were more significant and more clearly defined in Latin than in modern English. Length is the duration of time that a particular sound is held before proceeding to the next sound in a word. In the modern spelling of Latin, especially in dictionaries and academic work, macrons are frequently used to mark long vowels: {{angbr|ā}}, {{angbr|ē}}, {{angbr|ī}}, {{angbr|ō}}, {{angbr|ū}} and {{angbr|ȳ}}, while the breve is sometimes used to indicate that a vowel is short: {{angbr|ă}}, {{angbr|ĕ}}, {{angbr|ĭ}}, {{angbr|ŏ}}, {{angbr|ŭ}} and {{angbr|y̆}}.

Long consonants were usually indicated through doubling, but ancient Latin orthography did not distinguish between the vocalic and consonantal uses of {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|v}}. Vowel length was indicated only intermittently in classical sources and even then through a variety of means. Later medieval and modern usage tended to omit vowel length altogether. A short-lived convention of spelling long vowels by doubling the vowel letter is associated with the poet Lucius Accius. Later spelling conventions marked long vowels with an apex (a diacritic similar to an acute accent) or, in the case of long i, by increasing the height of the letter (long i); in the second century AD, those were given apices as well. The Classical vowel length system faded in later Latin and ceased to be phonemic in Romance, having been replaced by contrasts in vowel quality. Consonant length, however, remains contrastive in much of Italo-Romance, cf. Italian {{lang|it|nono}} &quot;ninth&quot; versus {{lang|it|nonno}} &quot;grandfather&quot;.
A minimal set showing both long and short vowels and long and short consonants is {{lang|la|ānus}} {{IPA|/ˈaː.nus/}} (&#x27;anus&#x27;), {{lang|la|annus}} {{IPA|/ˈan.nus/}} (&#x27;year&#x27;), {{lang|la|anus}} {{IPA|/ˈa.nus/}} (&#x27;old woman&#x27;).

===Table of orthography===

The letters {{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|d}}, {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|h}}, {{angbr|m}}, {{angbr|n}} are always pronounced as in English {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[f]}}, {{IPA|[h]}}, {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}} respectively, and they do not usually cause any difficulties. The exceptions are mentioned below:

==Syllables and stress==
===Nature of the accent===
Although some French and Italian scholars believe that the classical Latin accent was purely a pitch accent, which had no effect on the placing of words in a line of poetry, the view of most scholars is that the accent was a stress accent. One argument for this is that unlike most languages with tonal accents, there are no minimal pairs like ancient Greek {{lang|grc|φῶς}} (falling accent) &quot;light&quot; vs. {{lang|grc|φώς}} (rising accent) &quot;man&quot; where a change of accent on the same syllable changes the meaning. Among other arguments are the loss of vowels before or after the accent in words such as {{lang|la|discip(u)līna}} and {{lang|la|sinist(e)ra}}; and the shortening of post or pre-accentual syllables in Plautus and Terence by brevis brevians, for example, scansions such as {{lang|la|senex}} and {{lang|la|voluptātem}} with the second syllable short.

===Old Latin stress===
In Old Latin, as in Proto-Italic, stress normally fell on the first syllable of a word. During this period, the word-initial stress triggered changes in the vowels of non-initial syllables, the effects of which are still visible in classical Latin. Compare for example:
* {{lang|la|faciō}} &#x27;I do/make&#x27;, {{lang|la|factus}} &#x27;made&#x27;; pronounced {{IPA|/ˈfa.ki.oː/}} and {{IPA|/ˈfak.tus/}} in later Old Latin and Classical Latin.
* {{lang|la|afficiō}} &#x27;I affect&#x27;, {{lang|la|affectus}} &#x27;affected&#x27;; pronounced {{IPA|/ˈaf.fi.ki.oː/}} and {{IPA|/ˈaf.fek.tus/}} in Old Latin following vowel reduction, {{IPA|/af.ˈfi.ki.oː/}} and {{IPA|/af.ˈfek.tus/}} in Classical Latin.
In the earliest Latin writings, the original unreduced vowels are still visible. Study of this vowel reduction, as well as syncopation (dropping of short unaccented syllables) in Greek loan words, indicates that the stress remained word-initial until around the time of Plautus, in the 3rd century BC. The placement of the stress then shifted to become the pattern found in classical Latin.

===Classical Latin syllables and stress===
{{See also|Dreimorengesetz{{!}}&quot;Dreimorengesetz&quot;}}
In Classical Latin, stress changed. It moved from the first syllable to one of the last three syllables, called the antepenult, the penult, and the ultima (short for {{lang|la|antepaenultima}} &#x27;before almost last&#x27;, {{lang|la|paenultima}} &#x27;almost last&#x27;, and {{lang|la|ultima syllaba}} &#x27;last syllable&#x27;). Its position is determined by the syllable weight of the penult. If the penult is heavy, it is accented; if the penult is light and there are more than two syllables, the antepenult is accented. In a few words originally accented on the penult, accent is on the ultima because the two last syllables have been contracted, or the last syllable has been lost.

====Syllable====
To determine stress, syllable weight of the penult must be determined. To determine syllable weight, words must be broken up into syllables. In the following examples, syllable structure is represented using these symbols: C (a consonant), K (a stop), R (a liquid), and V (a short vowel), VV (a long vowel or diphthong).

====Nucleus====
Every short vowel, long vowel, or diphthong belongs to a single syllable. This vowel forms the syllable nucleus. Thus {{lang|la|magistrārum}} has four syllables, one for every vowel (a i ā u: V V VV V), {{lang|la|aereus}} has three (ae e u: VV V V), {{lang|la|tuō}} has two (u ō: V VV), and {{lang|la|cui}} has one (ui: VV).

====Onset and coda====
A consonant before a vowel or a consonant cluster at the beginning of a word is placed in the same syllable as the following vowel. This consonant or consonant cluster forms the syllable onset.
*{{lang|la|fēminae}} {{IPA|/feː.mi.nae̯/}} (CVV.CV.CVV)
*{{lang|la|uidēre}} {{IPA|/wi.deː.re/}} (CV.CVV.CV)
*{{lang|la|puerō}} {{IPA|/pu.e.roː/}} (CV.V.CVV)
*{{lang|la|beātae}} {{IPA|/be.aː.tae̯/}} (CV.VV.CVV)
*{{lang|la|grauiter}} {{IPA|/ɡra.wi.ter/}} (CCV.CV.CVC)
*{{lang|la|strātum}} {{IPA|/straː.tum/}} (CCCVV.CVC)

After this, if there is an additional consonant inside the word, it is placed at the end of the syllable. This consonant is the syllable coda. Thus if a consonant cluster of two consonants occurs between vowels, they are broken up between syllables: one goes with the syllable before, the other with the syllable after.
*{{lang|la|puella}} {{IPA|/pu.el.la/}} (CV.VC.CV)
*{{lang|la|supersum}} {{IPA|/su.per.sum/}} (CV.CVC.CVC)
*{{lang|la|coāctus}} {{IPA|/ko.aːk.tus/}} (CV.VVC.CVC)
*{{lang|la|intellēxit}} {{IPA|/in.tel.leːk.sit/}} (VC.CVC.CVVC.CVC)

There are two exceptions. A consonant cluster of a stop {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}}, {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, or {{IPA|/g/}} followed by a liquid {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/r/}} between vowels usually goes to the syllable after it, although it is also sometimes broken up like other consonant clusters.
*{{lang|la|uolucris}} {{IPA|/wo.lu.kris/}} or {{IPA|/wo.luk.ris/}} (CV.CV.KRVC or CV.CVK.RVC)

====Heavy and light syllables====
As shown in the examples above, Latin syllables have a variety of possible structures. Here are some of them. The first four examples are light syllables, and the last six are heavy. All syllables have at least one V (vowel). A syllable is heavy if it has another V or C (or both) after the first V. In the table below, the extra V or VC is bolded, indicating that it makes the syllable heavy.

Thus, a syllable is heavy if it ends in a long vowel or diphthong, a short vowel and a consonant, a long vowel and a consonant, or a diphthong and a consonant. Syllables ending in a diphthong and consonant are rare in Classical Latin.

The syllable onset has no relationship to syllable weight; both heavy and light syllables can have no onset or an onset of one, two, or three consonants.

In Latin a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a long vowel or diphthong is traditionally called {{lang|la|syllaba nātūrā longa}} ({{trans|syllable long by nature|literal=yes}}), and a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a consonant is called {{lang|la|positiōne longa}} ({{trans|long by position|literal=yes}}). These terms are translations of Greek {{lang|grc|συλλαβὴ μακρά φύσει}} ({{transl|grc|syllabḕ makrá phýsei}}) and {{lang|grc|μακρὰ θέσει}} ({{transl|grc|makrà thései}}), respectively; therefore {{lang|la|positiōne}} should not be mistaken for implying a syllable &quot;is long because of its position/place in a word&quot; but rather &quot;is treated as &#x27;long&#x27; by convention&quot;. This article uses the words &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;light&quot; for syllables, and &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; for vowels since the two are not the same.

====Stress rule====
In a word of three or more syllables, the weight of the penult determines where the accent is placed. If the penult is light, accent is placed on the antepenult; if it is heavy, accent is placed on the penult. Below, stress is marked by placing the stress mark {{angbr IPA|ˈ}} before the stressed syllable.

====Iambic shortening====
{{main|Brevis brevians}}
Iambic shortening or {{lang|la|brevis brevians}} is vowel shortening that occurs in words of the type &quot;light–heavy&quot;, where the light syllable is stressed. By this sound change, words like {{lang|la|egō}}, {{lang|la|modō}}, {{lang|la|benē}}, {{lang|la|amā}} with long final vowel change to {{lang|la|ego}}, {{lang|la|modo}}, {{lang|la|bene}}, {{lang|la|ama}} with short final vowel.

The term also refers to shortening of closed syllables following a short syllable, for example {{lang|la|quid ĕst, volŭptātem, apŭd iudicem}} and so on. This type of shortening is found in early Latin, for example in the comedies of Plautus and Terence, but not in poetry of the classical period.

==Elision==
Where one word ended with a vowel (including the nasalized vowels written {{angbr|am}}, {{angbr|em}}, {{angbr|im}}, {{angbr|om}} and {{angbr|um}}, and the diphthong {{angbr|ae}}) and the next word began with a vowel, the former vowel, at least in verse, was regularly elided; that is, it was omitted altogether, or possibly (in the case of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}) pronounced like the corresponding semivowel. When the second word was {{lang|la|est}} or {{lang|la|es}}, and possibly when the second word was {{lang|la|et}}, a different form of elision sometimes occurred (prodelision): the vowel of the preceding word was retained, and the {{angbr|e}} was elided instead. Elision also occurred in Ancient Greek, but in that language, it is shown in writing by the vowel in question being replaced by an apostrophe, whereas in Latin elision is not indicated at all in the orthography, but can be deduced from the verse form. Only occasionally is it found in inscriptions, as in {{lang|la|scriptust}} for {{lang|la|scriptum est}}.

==Modern conventions==

===Spelling===
====Letters====
Modern usage, even for classical Latin texts, varies in respect of {{angbr|I}} and {{angbr|V}}. During the Renaissance, the printing convention was to use {{angbr|I}} (upper case) and {{angbr|i}} (lower case) for both vocalic {{IPA|/i/}} and consonantal {{IPA|/j/}}, to use {{angbr|V}} in the upper case and in the lower case to use {{angbr|v}} at the start of words and {{angbr|u}} subsequently within the word regardless of whether {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} was represented.

Many publishers (such as Oxford University Press) have adopted the convention of using {{angbr|I}} (upper case) and {{angbr|i}} (lower case) for both {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{angbr|V}} (upper case) and {{angbr|u}} (lower case) for both {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.

An alternative approach, less common today, is to use {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|u}} only for the vowels, and {{angbr|j}} and {{angbr|v}} for the approximants.

Most modern editions, however, adopt an intermediate position, distinguishing between {{angbr|u}} and {{angbr|v}}, but not between {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|j}}. Usually, a non-vocalic {{angbr|v}} after {{angbr|q}}, {{angbr|g}} or {{angbr|s}} is still printed as {{angbr|u}} rather than {{angbr|v}}, likely because these did not change from {{IPA|/w/}} to {{IPA|/v/}} post-classically.{{efn|This approach is also recommended in the help page for the Latin Wikipedia.}}

====Diacritics====
Textbooks and dictionaries usually indicate the length of vowels by putting a macron or horizontal bar above the long vowel, but it is not generally done in regular texts. Occasionally, mainly in early printed texts up to the 18th century, one may see a circumflex used to indicate a long vowel where this makes a difference to the sense, for instance, {{lang|la|Româ}} {{IPA|/ˈroːmaː/}} (&#x27;from Rome&#x27; ablative) compared to {{lang|la|Roma}} {{IPA|/ˈroːma/}} (&#x27;Rome&#x27; nominative).

Sometimes, for instance in Roman Catholic service books, an acute accent over a vowel is used to indicate the stressed syllable. It would be redundant for one who knew the classical rules of accentuation and made the correct distinction between long and short vowels, but most Latin speakers since the 3rd century have not made any distinction between long and short vowels, but they have kept the accents in the same places; thus, the use of accent marks allows speakers to read a word aloud correctly even if they have never heard it spoken aloud.

===Pronunciation===

====Post-Medieval Latin====
{{main|Neo-Latin#Pronunciation|l1=Pronunciation of Neo-Latin}}
Since around the beginning of the Renaissance period onwards, with the language being used as an international language among intellectuals, pronunciation of Latin in Europe came to be dominated by the phonology of local languages, resulting in a variety of different pronunciation systems. See the article &quot;Latin regional pronunciation&quot; for more details on those (with the exception of the Italian one, which is described in the section on &quot;Ecclesiastical pronunciation&quot; below).

====Loan words and formal study====

When Latin words are used as loanwords in a modern language, there is ordinarily little or no attempt to pronounce them as the Romans did; in most cases, a pronunciation suiting the phonology of the receiving language is employed.

Latin words in common use in English are generally fully assimilated into the English sound system, with little to mark them as foreign; for example, &quot;cranium&quot;, &quot;saliva&quot;. Other words have a stronger Latin feel to them, usually because of spelling features such as the digraphs {{angbr|ae}} and {{angbr|oe}} (occasionally written with the ligatures: {{angbr|æ}} and {{angbr|œ}}, respectively), which both denote {{IPA|/iː/}} in English. The digraph {{angbr|ae}} or ligature {{angbr|æ}} in some words tend to be given an {{IPA|/aɪ/}} pronunciation; for example, &quot;curriculum vitae&quot;.

However, using loanwords in the context of the language borrowing them is a markedly different situation from the study of Latin itself. In this classroom setting, instructors and students attempt to recreate at least some sense of the original pronunciation. What is taught to native anglophones is suggested by the sounds of today&#x27;s Romance languages,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} the direct descendants of Latin. Instructors who take this approach rationalize that Romance vowels probably come closer to the original pronunciation than those of any other modern language (see also the section {{slink||Pronunciation shared by Vulgar Latin and Romance languages}} below).

However, other languages—including Romance family members—all have their own interpretations of the Latin phonological system, applied both to loan words and formal study of Latin. But English, Romance, or other teachers do not always point out that the particular accent their students learn is not actually the way ancient Romans spoke.

====Ecclesiastical pronunciation====
{{see also|Ecclesiastical Latin}}
Since the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an Italianate pronunciation of Latin has grown to be accepted as a universal standard in the Catholic Church. Before then, the pronunciation of Latin in church was the same as the pronunciation of Latin in other fields and tended to reflect the sound values associated with the nationality and native language of the speaker.{{sfn|Brittain|1955}} Other ecclesiastical pronunciations are still in use, especially outside the Catholic Church.

A guide to this Italianate pronunciation is provided below. Since the letters or letter-combinations {{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|d}}, {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|m}}, {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|ph}} and {{angbr|v}} are pronounced as they are in English, they are not included in the table.


* Vowel length is not phonemic. As a result, the automatic stress accent of Classical Latin, which was dependent on vowel length, becomes a phonemic one in Ecclesiastical Latin. (Some Ecclesiastical texts mark the stress with an acute accent in words of three or more syllables.)
* Word-final {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}} are pronounced fully, with no nasalization of the preceding vowel.

In his &quot;Vox Latina: A guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Latin&quot;, William Sidney Allen remarked that this pronunciation, used by the Catholic Church in Rome and elsewhere, and whose adoption Pope Pius X recommended in a 1912 letter to the Archbishop of Bourges, &quot;is probably less far removed from classical Latin than any other &#x27;national&#x27; pronunciation&quot;; but, as can be seen from the table above, there are, nevertheless, very significant differences. The introduction to the &quot;Liber Usualis&quot; indicates that Ecclesiastical Latin pronunciation should be used at Church liturgies. The Pontifical Academy for Latin is the pontifical academy in the Vatican that is charged with the dissemination and education of Catholics in the Latin language.

Outside of Austria, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia, it is the most widely used standard in choral singing which, with a few exceptions like Stravinsky&#x27;s {{lang|la|Oedipus rex}}, is concerned with liturgical texts.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} Anglican choirs adopted it when classicists abandoned traditional English pronunciation after World War II. The rise of historically informed performance and the availability of guides such as Copeman&#x27;s &quot;Singing in Latin&quot; has led to the recent revival of regional pronunciations.

==Pronunciation shared by Vulgar Latin and Romance languages==
{{Main article|Phonological changes from Classical Latin to Proto-Romance|Palatalization in the Romance languages}}
As Classical Latin developed to Late Latin, and eventually into the modern Romance languages, it experienced several phonological changes. Notable changes include the following (the precise order of which is uncertain):

* Loss of {{IPA|/h/}}, in all contexts, and loss of final {{IPA|/m/}}, in polysyllabic words.
* Monophthongization of {{IPA|/ae̯ oe̯/}} to {{IPA|/ɛː eː/}} respectively.
* Fortition of {{IPA|/w/}} to {{IPA|/β/}}, then lenition of intervocalic {{IPA|/b/}} to {{IPA|/β/}}. (Later developing to {{IPA|/v/}} in many areas.)
* Phonemic (no longer allophonic) loss of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/s/}} and of final in polysyllabic words.
* Phonemic (no longer allophonic) development of {{IPA|/i e/}} to {{IPA|/j/}} when unstressed and in hiatus.
* Palatalization of the consonants {{IPA|/t d/}} by a following {{IPA|/j/}}.
* Loss of phonemic vowel length, with vowel quality becoming the distinctive factor instead. A number of vowel mergers followed as a result.
* Palatalization of various other consonants by a following {{IPA|/j/}}.
* Palatalization of {{IPA|/k ɡ/}} before front vowels (not everywhere).

==Examples==

The following examples are both in verse, which demonstrates several features more clearly than prose.

===From Classical Latin===
Virgil&#x27;s {{lang|la|Aeneid}}, Book 1, verses 1–4. Quantitative metre (dactylic hexameter). Translation: &quot;I sing of arms and the man, who, driven by fate, came first from the borders of Troy to Italy and the Lavinian shores; he [was] much afflicted both on lands and on the deep by the power of the gods, because of fierce Juno&#x27;s vindictive wrath.&quot;

Note the elisions in {{lang|la|mult(um)}} and {{lang|la|ill(e)}} in the third line. For a fuller discussion of the prosodic features of this passage, see Dactylic hexameter.

Some manuscripts have &quot;{{lang|la|Lāvīna}}&quot; rather than &quot;{{lang|la|Lāvīnia}}&quot; in the second line.

===From Medieval Latin===
Beginning of {{lang|la|Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium}} by Thomas Aquinas (13th century). Rhymed accentual metre. Translation: &quot;Extol, [my] tongue, the mystery of the glorious body and the precious blood, which the fruit of a noble womb, the king of nations, poured out as the price of the world.&quot;

# Traditional orthography as in Roman Catholic service books (stressed syllable marked with an acute accent on words of three syllables or more). {{lang|la|italic=unset|

<text>In linguistics and grammar, &quot;conjugation&quot; has two basic meanings. One meaning is the creation of derived forms of a verb from basic forms, or principal parts. 

The second meaning of the word &quot;conjugation&quot; is a group of verbs which all have the same pattern of inflections. Thus all those Latin verbs which in the present tense have 1st singular -ō, 2nd singular -ās, and infinitive -āre are said to belong to the 1st conjugation, those with 1st singular -eō, 2nd singular -ēs and infinitive -ēre belong to the 2nd conjugation, and so on. The number of conjugations of regular verbs is usually said to be four.

The word &quot;conjugation&quot; comes from the Latin , a calque of the Greek (&quot;syzygia&quot;), literally &quot;yoking together (horses into a team)&quot;.

For examples of verbs and verb groups for each inflectional class, see the Wiktionary appendix pages for , , , and .

==Number of conjugations==
The ancient Romans themselves, beginning with Varro (1st century BC), originally divided their verbs into three conjugations ( &quot;there are three different conjugations for verbs: the first, second, and third&quot; (Donatus), 4th century AD), according to whether the ending of the 2nd person singular had an &quot;a&quot;, an &quot;e&quot; or an &quot;i&quot; in it. However, others, such as Sacerdos (3rd century AD), Dositheus (4th century AD) and Priscian (c. 500 AD), recognised four different groups.

In modern times grammarians generally recognise four conjugations according to the ending of the active infinitive: namely -āre, -ēre, -ere, or -īre, for example: (1) &quot;to love&quot;, (2) &quot;to see&quot;, (3) &quot;to rule&quot; and &quot;to capture&quot;, (4) &quot;to hear&quot;. (3rd conjugation verbs ending in &quot;-iō&quot; such as are sometimes known as &quot;mixed conjugation&quot; since they use a mixture of 3rd and 4th conjugation endings.)

In addition to regular verbs, which belong to one or other of the four regular conjugations, there are also a few irregular verbs, which have a different pattern of endings. The most frequent of these is the verb &quot;to be&quot; together with its prefixed derivatives.

There also exist deponent Latin verbs, which though active in meaning have endings identical to the passive endings of ordinary verbs. Examples in the different conjugations are: (1) &quot;to delay&quot;, (2) &quot;to promise&quot;, (3) &quot;to follow&quot; and &quot;to go back&quot;, (4) &quot;to lie (tell a lie)&quot;. Some verbs are semi-deponent, using passive forms for the perfect tenses only.

==Principal parts== 
A verb&#x27;s full paradigm relies on multiple stems. The present indicative active and the present infinitive are both based on the present stem. 

It is not possible to infer the stems for other tenses from the present stem. This means that, although the infinitive active form normally shows the verb conjugation, knowledge of several different forms is necessary to be able to confidently produce the full range of forms for any particular verb.

In a dictionary, Latin verbs are listed with four &quot;principal parts&quot; (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs), which allow the student to deduce the other conjugated forms of the verbs. These are:
# the first person singular of the present indicative active
# the present infinitive active
# the first person singular of the perfect indicative active
# the supine or, in some grammars, the perfect passive participle, which uses the same stem. (Texts that list the perfect passive participle use the future active participle for intransitive verbs.) Some verbs lack this principal part altogether.

==Regular conjugations==
=== First conjugation ===
The first conjugation is characterized by the vowel &quot;ā&quot; and can be recognized by the &quot;-āre&quot; ending of the present active infinitive form. The infectum tenses conjugate as follows (see also their meaning):
* The 2nd person singular passive &#x27; can be shortened to &#x27;. &quot;-re&quot; was the regular form in early Latin and (except in the present indicative) in Cicero; &quot;-ris&quot; was preferred later.

In early Latin (Plautus), the 3rd singular endings &quot;-at&quot; and &quot;-et&quot; were pronounced &quot;-āt&quot; and &quot;-ēt&quot; with a long vowel.

Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to love&quot;
*Passive infinitive: &#x27; &quot;to be loved&quot; (in early Latin often &#x27;)
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;love!&quot;
*Future imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;love! (at a future time)&quot;
*Indirect imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;let him love!&quot;
*Passive imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be loved!&quot; (usually only found in deponent verbs)
*Passive future imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be loved! (at a future time)&quot;
*Passive indirect imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;let him be loved!&quot;
*Present participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;loving&quot;
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to love&quot;
*Gerundive: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;needing to be loved&quot;
*Gerund: &#x27; &quot;of loving&quot;, &#x27; &quot;by/for loving&quot;, &quot;in order to love&quot;
The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:
* The perfect has the suffix &quot;-āvī&quot;. The majority of first-conjugation verbs follow this pattern, which is considered to be &quot;regular&quot;, for example:
** , &quot;to love&quot;;
** , &quot;to order&quot;;
** , &quot;to praise&quot;;
** , &quot;to deny&quot;;
** , &quot;to announce, report&quot;;
** , &quot;to beg, pray&quot;;
** , &quot;to prepare&quot;;
** , &quot;to carry&quot;;
** , &quot;to fight&quot;;
** , &quot;to think&quot;;
** , &quot;to ask&quot;;
** , &quot;to save&quot;;
** , &quot;to call&quot;;

* The perfect has the suffix &quot;-uī&quot;, for example:
** , &quot;to rub&quot;;
** , &quot;to cut, to divide&quot;;
** , &quot;to forbid, to prohibit&quot;;

* The perfect has the suffix &quot;-ī&quot; and vowel lengthening in the stem, for example:
** , &quot;to help, to assist&quot;;
** , &quot;to wash, to bathe&quot;;

* The perfect is reduplicated, for example:
** , &quot;to give&quot;
** , &quot;to stand&quot;;

The verb &#x27; &quot;I give&quot; is irregular in that except in the 2nd singular &#x27; and imperative &#x27;, the &quot;a&quot; is short, e.g. &#x27; &quot;I will give&quot;.

The &quot;a&quot; is also short in the supine &#x27; and its derivatives, but the other parts of &#x27; &quot;I stand&quot; are regular.

Deponent verbs in this conjugation all follow the pattern below, which is the passive of the first type above:
:* &quot;to think&quot;
:* &quot;to try&quot;
:* &quot;to hesitate&quot;
:* &quot;to exhort&quot;
:* &quot;to be surprised, to be amazed at&quot;
:* &quot;to delay, stay&quot;

====Perfect tenses====
The three tenses of the 1st conjugation go as in the following table:

In poetry (and also sometimes in prose, e.g. Livy), the 3rd person plural of the perfect indicative is often &#x27; instead of &#x27;. Occasionally the form is also found.

In early Latin, the future perfect indicative had a short &quot;i&quot; in , but by the time of Cicero these forms were usually pronounced with a long &quot;i&quot;, in the same way as in the perfect subjunctive. Virgil has a short &quot;i&quot; for both tenses; Horace uses both forms for both tenses; Ovid uses both forms for the future perfect, but a long &quot;i&quot; in the perfect subjunctive.

The &quot;-v-&quot; of the perfect active tenses sometimes drops out, especially in the pluperfect subjunctive: &#x27; for &#x27;. Forms such as &#x27; and &#x27; are also found.

The passive tenses also have feminine and neuter forms, e.g. &#x27; &quot;she was loved&quot;, &#x27; &quot;it was announced&quot;.

Forms made with instead of and instead of are also found, for example and so on, but these are not common in classical Latin. See Latin tenses.

For other meanings of the perfect and pluperfect subjunctive, see Latin tenses#Jussive subjunctive.

Other forms:

*Perfect infinitive active: &#x27; (&#x27;) &quot;to have loved&quot;
*Perfect infinitive passive: &#x27; (&#x27;) &quot;to have been loved&quot;
*Perfect participle passive: &quot;loved (by someone)&quot;

=== Second conjugation ===
The second conjugation is characterized by the vowel ē, and can be recognized by the -eō ending of the first person present indicative and the -ēre ending of the present active infinitive form: 

The passive also often means &quot;I seem&quot;.

Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to see&quot;
*Passive infinitive: &quot;to be seen&quot;
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;see!&quot;
*Future imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;see! (at a future time)&quot; 
*Passive imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be seen!&quot; (usually only found in deponent verbs)
*Present participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;seeing&quot;
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to see&quot;
*Gerundive: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;needing to be seen&quot;
*Gerund: &#x27; &quot;of seeing&quot;, &#x27; &quot;by /for seeing&quot;, &quot;in order to see&quot;

The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:

* The perfect has the suffix &quot;-uī&quot;. Verbs which follow this pattern are considered to be &quot;regular&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;to owe, be obliged&quot;
** &quot;to teach, to instruct&quot;
** &quot;to lie (on the ground/bed)&quot;
** &quot;to deserve&quot;
** &quot;to mix&quot;
** &quot;to warn, advise&quot;
** &quot;to be harmful&quot;
** &quot;to provide, show&quot;
** &quot;to hold, to keep&quot;
** &quot;to frighten, to deter&quot;
** &quot;to fear&quot;
** &quot;to be strong&quot;

* The perfect has the suffix &quot;–ēvī&quot;. Example:
** &quot;to destroy&quot;
** &quot;to weep&quot;

In verbs with perfect in &quot;-vī&quot;, syncopated (i.e. abbreviated) forms are common, such as for .

* The perfect has the suffix &quot;–īvī&quot;. Example:
** &quot;to arouse, to stir&quot;

* The perfect has the suffix &quot;-sī&quot; (which combines with a preceding &quot;c&quot; or &quot;g&quot; to &quot;–xī&quot;). Examples:
** &quot;to burn&quot;
** &quot;to increase, to enlarge&quot;
** &quot;to stick, to adhere, to get stuck&quot;
** &quot;to order&quot;
** &quot;to remain&quot;
** &quot;to persuade&quot;
** &quot;to laugh&quot;

* The perfect is reduplicated with &quot;-ī&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;to bite&quot;
** &quot;to vow, to promise&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-ī&quot; and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:
** &quot;to be cautious&quot;
** &quot;to favour&quot;
** &quot;to caress, to cherish&quot;
** &quot;to sit&quot;
** &quot;to see&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-ī&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;to reply&quot;
** &quot;to hiss, to creak&quot; (also 3rd conj.)

Deponent verbs in this conjugation are few. They mostly go like the passive of , but and have a perfect participle with &quot;ss&quot;:
:* &quot;to confess&quot;
:* &quot;to deserve&quot;
:* &quot;to promise&quot;

The following are semi-deponent, that is, they are deponent only in the three perfect tenses:
:* &quot;to dare&quot;
:* &quot;to rejoice, to be glad&quot;
:* &quot;to be accustomed&quot;

=== Third conjugation ===
The third conjugation has a variable short stem vowel, which may be e, i, or u in different environments. Verbs of this conjugation end in -ere in the present active infinitive. Deponent verbs have the infinitive -ī.
The future tense in the 3rd and 4th conjugation (&quot;-am, -ēs, -et&quot; etc.) differs from that in the 1st and 2nd conjugation (&quot;-bō, -bis, -bit&quot; etc.). 

Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to lead&quot;
*Passive infinitive: &quot;to be led&quot; (the 3rd conjugation has no &quot;r&quot;)
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;lead!&quot;
*Future imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;lead! (at a future time)&quot; 
*Passive imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be led!&quot; (usually only found in deponent verbs)
*Present participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;leading&quot;
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to lead&quot;
*Gerundive: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;needing to be led&quot;
*Gerund: &#x27; &quot;of leading&quot;, &#x27; &quot;by /for leading&quot;, &quot;in order to lead&quot;

Four 3rd conjugation verbs usually have no ending in the imperative singular: &#x27; &quot;lead!&quot;, &#x27; &quot;say!&quot;, &#x27; &quot;bring!&quot;, &#x27; &quot;do!&quot;. 

Others, like &quot;run!&quot;, have the ending &quot;-e&quot;.

There is no regular rule for constructing the perfect stem of third-conjugation verbs, but the following patterns are used:

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-sī&quot; (&quot;-xī&quot; when &quot;c&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, or &quot;h&quot; comes at the end of the root). Examples:
** &quot;to pluck, to select&quot;
** &quot;to yield, depart&quot;
** &quot;to close&quot;
** &quot;to despise, disdain, treat with contempt&quot;
** &quot;to say&quot;
** &quot;to divide&quot;
** &quot;to lead&quot;
** &quot;to bend, to twist&quot;
** &quot;to wear, to bear; wage (war)&quot;
** &quot;to send&quot;
** &quot;to rule&quot;
** &quot;to write&quot;
** &quot;to cover, conceal&quot;
** &quot;to drag, to pull&quot;
** &quot;to live&quot;

* The perfect is reduplicated with suffix &quot;–ī&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;to fall&quot;
** &quot;to kill, to slay&quot;
** &quot;to run, to race&quot;
** &quot;to learn&quot;
** &quot;to cheat&quot;
** &quot;to fart&quot;
** &quot;to beat, to drive away&quot;
** &quot;to claim, request&quot;
** &quot;to touch, to hit&quot;
** &quot;to stretch&quot;

Although &quot;to give&quot; is 1st conjugation, its compounds are 3rd conjugation and have internal reduplication:
:* &quot;to found&quot;
:* &quot;to entrust, believe&quot;
:* &quot;to surrender&quot;
:* &quot;to destroy, lose&quot;
:* &quot;to give back&quot;
:* &quot;to hand over&quot;

Likewise the compounds of have internal reduplication. Although is transitive, its compounds are intransitive:
:* &quot;to cause to stand&quot;
:* &quot;to come to a halt&quot;
:* &quot;to stand off&quot;
:* &quot;to resist&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-vī&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;to smear, to daub&quot; (also 4th conj. )
** &quot;to seek, to attack&quot;
** &quot;to look for, ask&quot;
** &quot;to sow, to plant&quot;
** &quot;to spread, to stretch out&quot;
** &quot;to rub, to wear out&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-ī&quot; and vowel lengthening in the stem. If the present stem has an &quot;n&quot; infix, as in and , the infix disappears in the perfect. In some cases, the long vowel in the perfect is thought to be derived from an earlier reduplicated form, e.g. . Examples:
** &quot;to do, to drive&quot;
** &quot;to compel, gather together&quot;
** &quot;to buy&quot;
** &quot;to pour&quot;
** &quot;to collect, to read&quot;
** &quot;to leave behind&quot;
** &quot;to burst&quot;
** &quot;to conquer, to defeat&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-ī&quot; only. Examples:
** &quot;to climb, to go up&quot;
** &quot;to establish, decide, cause to stand&quot;
** &quot;to defend&quot;
** &quot;to drive out, expel&quot;
** &quot;to strike&quot;
** &quot;to fear, be apprehensive&quot;
** &quot;to kill&quot;
** &quot;to show&quot;
** &quot;to lift, raise, remove&quot;
** &quot;to turn&quot;
** &quot;to visit&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;–uī&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;to cultivate, to till&quot;

====Third conjugation -iō verbs====
Intermediate between the third and fourth conjugation are the third-conjugation verbs with suffix –iō. These resemble the fourth conjugation in some forms. 
Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to capture, to take&quot;
*Passive infinitive: &quot;to be captured&quot; (the 3rd conjugation has no &quot;r&quot;)
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;capture!&quot;
*Future imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;capture! (at a future time)&quot; 
*Passive imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be captured!&quot; (usually only found in deponent verbs)
*Future passive imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be captured! (at a future time)&quot; (usually only found in deponent verbs)
*Present participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;capturing&quot;
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to capture&quot;
*Gerundive: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;needing to be captured&quot; ( is also sometimes found)

:* &quot;to go out&quot;
:* &quot;to die&quot;
:* &quot;to suffer, to allow&quot;
:* &quot;to attack&quot;
:* &quot;to go back&quot;

=== Fourth conjugation ===
The fourth conjugation is characterized by the vowel ī and can be recognized by the -īre ending of the present active infinitive. Deponent verbs have the infinitive -īrī:
Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to hear&quot;
*Passive infinitive: &quot;to be heard&quot;
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;hear!&quot;
*Future imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;hear! (at a future time)&quot; 
*Passive imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be heard!&quot; (usually only found in deponent verbs)
*Present participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;hearing&quot;
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to hear&quot;
*Gerundive: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;needing to be heard&quot;
*Gerund: &#x27; &quot;of hearing&quot;, &#x27; &quot;by /for hearing&quot;, &quot;in order to hear&quot;

Principal parts of verbs in the fourth conjugation generally adhere to the following patterns:

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-vī&quot;. Verbs which adhere to this pattern are considered to be &quot;regular&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;to hear, listen (to)&quot;
** &quot;to guard&quot;
** &quot;to sleep&quot;
** &quot;to hinder, impede&quot;
** &quot;to fortify, to build&quot;
** &quot;to punish&quot;
** &quot;to know&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-uī&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;to open, to uncover&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-sī&quot; (&quot;-xī&quot; when &quot;c&quot; comes at the end of the root). Examples:
** &quot;to surround, to enclose&quot;
** &quot;to confirm, to ratify&quot;
** &quot;to feel, to perceive&quot;
** &quot;to bind&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-ī&quot; and reduplication. Examples:
** &quot;to find, discover&quot;

* The perfect has suffix &quot;-ī&quot; and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:
** &quot;to come, to arrive&quot;
** &quot;to find&quot;

Deponent verbs in the 4th conjugation include the following:
:* &quot;to assent&quot;
:* &quot;to experience, test&quot;
:* &quot;to bestow&quot;
:* &quot;to tell a lie&quot;
:* &quot;to measure&quot;
:* &quot;to exert oneself, set in motion, build&quot;
:* &quot;to obtain, gain possession of&quot;
:* &quot;to cast lots&quot;

The verb &quot;to arise&quot; is also regarded as 4th conjugation, although some parts, such as the 3rd singular present tense and imperfect subjunctive , have a short vowel like the 3rd conjugation. But its compound &quot;to rise up, attack&quot; is entirely 4th conjugation.

In the perfect tenses, shortened forms without &quot;-v-&quot; are common, for example, for . Cicero, however, prefers the full forms to .

==Irregular verb==
===&quot;Sum&quot; and &quot;possum&quot;===
The verb &quot;to be&quot; is the most common verb in Latin. It is conjugated as follows:

In early Latin (e.g. Plautus), &#x27; can be found for the present subjunctive &#x27;. In poetry the subjunctive also sometimes occurs.

An alternative imperfect subjunctive is sometimes made using etc. See further: Latin tenses#Foret.

Other forms:

*Infinitive: &#x27; &quot;to be&quot;, &#x27; &quot;to be able&quot;
*Perfect infinitive: &#x27; &quot;to have been&quot;, &#x27; &quot;to have been able&quot;
*Future infinitive: &#x27; &quot;to be going to be&quot; (also &#x27;)
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be!&quot;
*Future imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be! (at a future time)&quot; 
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to be&quot; ( has no future participle or future infinitive.)

The present participle is found only in the compounds &#x27; &quot;absent&quot; and &#x27; &quot;present&quot;.

In Plautus and Lucretius, an infinitive &#x27; is sometimes found for &#x27; &quot;to be able&quot;.

The principal parts of these verbs are as follows:
:* &quot;to be&quot;
:* &quot;to be away&quot;
:* &quot;to be present&quot;
:* &quot;to be wanting&quot;
:* &quot;to be able&quot;
:* &quot;to be for, to profit&quot; (adds &quot;d&quot; before a vowel)

The perfect tenses conjugate in the regular way.

For the difference in meaning between and , see Latin tenses#Difference between eram and fuī

===&quot;Volō&quot;, &quot;nōlō&quot;, and &quot;mālō&quot;===
The verb and its derivatives and (short for ) resemble a 3rd conjugation verb, but the present subjunctive ending in &quot;-im&quot; is different:

The spellings &#x27; and &#x27; were used up until the time of Cicero for &#x27; and &#x27;.

These verbs are not used in the passive.

Other forms: 

* Infinitive: &#x27; &quot;to want&quot;, &#x27; &quot;to be unwilling&quot;, &quot;to prefer&quot;
* Present participle: &#x27; &quot;willing&quot;, &#x27; &quot;unwilling&quot;
* Imperative: &#x27;, pl. &#x27; (used in expressions such as &quot;don&#x27;t be surprised!&quot;)

Principal parts:

:* &quot;to want&quot;
:* &quot;not to want, to be unwilling&quot;
:* &quot;to prefer&quot;

The perfect tenses are formed regularly.

===&quot;Eō&quot; and compounds===
The verb &quot;I go&quot; is an irregular 4th conjugation verb, in which the &quot;i&quot; of the stem sometimes becomes &quot;e&quot;. Like 1st and 2nd conjugation verbs, it uses the future &quot;-bō, -bis, -bit&quot;:

Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to go&quot;
*Passive infinitive: &quot;to go&quot; (used impersonally, e.g. &quot;not knowing which way to go&quot;)
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;go!&quot;
*Future imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;go! (at a future time)&quot; (rare)
*Present participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going&quot;
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to go&quot;
*Gerundive: &quot;necessary to go&quot; (used impersonally only)
*Gerund: &#x27; &quot;of going&quot;, &#x27; &quot;by / for going&quot;, &quot;in order to go&quot;

The impersonal passive forms &#x27; &quot;they go&quot;, &#x27; &quot;they went&quot; are sometimes found.

The principal parts of some verbs which conjugate like are the following:
:* &quot;to go&quot;
:* &quot;to go away&quot;
:* &quot;to go up to&quot;
:* &quot;to meet, assemble&quot;
:* &quot;to go out&quot;
:* &quot;to enter&quot;
:* &quot;to perish&quot;
:* &quot;to enter&quot;
:* &quot;to die, to perish&quot;
:* &quot;to pass by&quot;
:* &quot;to return, to go back&quot;
:* &quot;to go under, to approach stealthily, to undergo&quot;
:* &quot;to be sold&quot;

In the perfect tenses of these verbs, the &quot;-v-&quot; is almost always omitted, especially in the compounds, although the form is common in the Vulgate Bible translation.

In some perfect forms, the vowels &quot;ii-&quot; are contracted to &quot;ī-&quot;: second person singular perfect , second person plural perfect ; pluperfect subjunctive ; perfect infinitive (the form is also attested).

The verb &quot;to be able&quot; has forms similar to .

===&quot;Ferō&quot; and compounds===
The verb &quot;to bring, to bear, to carry&quot; is 3rd conjugation, but irregular in that the vowel following the root &quot;fer-&quot; is sometimes omitted. The perfect tense and supine stem are also irregularly formed.

The future tense in the 3rd and 4th conjugation (&quot;-am, -ēs, -et&quot; etc.) differs from that in the 1st and 2nd conjugation (&quot;-bō, -bis, -bit&quot; etc.). 

Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to bring&quot;
*Passive infinitive: &quot;to be brought&quot;
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;bring!&quot;
*Passive imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;be carried!&quot; (rare)
*Present participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;bringing&quot;
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to bring&quot;
*Gerundive: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;needing to be brought&quot;
*Gerund: &#x27; &quot;of bringing&quot;, &#x27; &quot;by /for bringing&quot;, &quot;in order to bring&quot;

Compounds of include the following:
The principal parts of some verbs which conjugate like are the following:
:* &quot;to bring (to)&quot;
:* &quot;to carry away, to steal&quot;
:* &quot;to collect&quot;
:* &quot;to put off&quot;
:* &quot;to carry out&quot;
:* &quot;to offer&quot;
:* &quot;to refer&quot;

The perfect tense , however, belongs to the verb :
:* &quot;to raise, to remove&quot;

===&quot;Fīō&quot;===
The irregular verb &quot;to become, to happen, to be done, to be made&quot; as well as being a verb in its own right serves as the passive of &quot;to do, to make&quot;. The perfect tenses are identical with the perfect passive tenses of .

The 1st and 2nd plural forms are almost never found.

Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to become, to be done, to happen&quot;
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;become!&quot;

===&quot;Edō&quot;===
The verb &quot;to eat&quot; has regular 3rd conjugation forms appearing alongside irregular ones:
Other forms:

*Infinitive: &quot;to eat&quot;
*Passive infinitive: &quot;to be eaten&quot;
*Imperative: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;eat!&quot;
*Present participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;eating&quot;
*Future participle: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;going to eat&quot;
*Gerundive: &#x27; (pl. &#x27;) &quot;needing to be eaten&quot;
*Gerund: &#x27; &quot;of eating&quot;, &#x27; &quot;by /for eating&quot;, &quot;in order to eat&quot; / &quot;for eating&quot;

The passive form &quot;it is eaten&quot; is also found.

The present subjunctive etc. is found mostly in early Latin.

In writing, there is a possibility of confusion between the forms of this verb and those of &quot;I am&quot; and &quot;I give out, put forth&quot;; for example, &quot;to eat&quot; vs. &quot;to be&quot;; &quot;he eats&quot; vs. &quot;he gives out&quot;.

The compound verb &quot;to eat up, consume&quot; is similar.

== Non-finite forms ==
The non-finite forms of verbs are participles, infinitives, supines, gerunds and gerundives. The verbs used are:

:1st conjugation: – to praise
:2nd conjugation: – to frighten, deter
:3rd conjugation: – to seek, attack
:3rd conjugation (&quot;-i&quot; stem): – to take, capture
:4th conjugation: – to hear, listen (to)

=== Participles ===
There are four participles: present active, perfect passive, future active, and future passive (= the gerundive).
*The present active participle is declined as a 3rd declension adjective. The ablative singular is &quot;-e&quot;, but the plural follows the i-stem declension with genitive &quot;-ium&quot; and neuter plural &quot;-ia&quot;.
*The perfect passive participle is declined like a 1st and 2nd declension adjective.
**In all conjugations, the perfect participle is formed by removing the &quot;–um&quot; from the supine, and adding a &quot;–us&quot; (masculine nominative singular).
*The future active participle is declined like a 1st and 2nd declension adjective.
**In all conjugations the &quot;-um&quot; is removed from the supine, and an &quot;-ūrus&quot; (masculine nominative singular) is added.
*The future passive participle, more usually called the gerundive, is formed by taking the present stem, adding &quot;-nd-&quot;, and the usual first and second declension endings. Thus forms . The usual meaning is &quot;needing to be praised&quot;, expressing a sense of obligation.

=== Infinitives ===
There are seven main infinitives. They are in the present active, present passive, perfect active, perfect passive, future active, future passive, and potential active. Further infinitives can be made using the gerundive.
*The present active infinitive is the second principal part (in regular verbs). It plays an important role in the syntactic construction of Accusative and infinitive, for instance.
** means, &quot;to praise.&quot;
*The present passive infinitive is formed by adding a &quot;–rī&quot; to the present stem. This is only so for the first, second and fourth conjugations. In the third conjugation, the thematical vowel, &quot;e&quot;, is taken from the present stem, and an &quot;–ī&quot; is added.
** translates as &quot;to be praised.&quot;
*The perfect active infinitive is formed by adding an &quot;–isse&quot; onto the perfect stem.
** translates as &quot;to have praised.&quot;
*The perfect passive infinitive uses the perfect passive participle along with the auxiliary verb . The perfect passive infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number, gender, and case (nominative or accusative).
** means, &quot;to have been praised.&quot;
*The future active infinitive uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb .
** means, &quot;to be going to praise.&quot; The future active infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number, gender, and case (nominative or accusative).
** has two future infinitives: and 
*The future passive infinitive uses the supine with the auxiliary verb . Because the first part is a supine, the ending &quot;-um&quot; does not change for gender or number.
** is translated as &quot;to be going to be praised.&quot; This is normally used in indirect speech. For example: &quot;He hopes that he will be acquitted.&quot;
*The potential infinitive uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb .
** is used only in indirect statements to represent a potential imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive of direct speech. It is translated with &quot;would&quot; or &quot;would have&quot;. For example: (Quintilian) &#x27;it seems unlikely that he would have told a lie, if he had not been desperate&#x27;

The future passive infinitive was not very commonly used. The Romans themselves often used an alternate expression, followed by a subjunctive clause.

=== Supine ===
The supine is the fourth principal part of the verb, as given in Latin dictionaries. It resembles a masculine noun of the fourth declension. Supines only occur in the accusative and ablative cases.
*The accusative form ends in a &quot;–um&quot;, and is used with a verb of motion in order to show purpose. Thus it is only used with verbs like &quot;to go&quot;, &quot;to come&quot;, etc. The accusative form of a supine can also take an object if needed.
** – The father came to praise his children.
*The ablative, which ends in a &quot;–ū&quot;, is used with the Ablative of Specification.
** – These arms were the easiest to praise.
=== Gerund ===
The gerund is formed similarly to the present active participle. However, the &quot;-ns&quot; becomes an &quot;-ndus&quot;, and the preceding &quot;ā&quot; or &quot;ē&quot; is shortened. Gerunds are neuter nouns of the second declension, but the nominative case is not present. The gerund is a noun, meaning &quot;the act of doing (the verb)&quot;, and forms a suppletive paradigm to the infinitive, which cannot be declined. For example, the genitive form can mean &quot;of praising&quot;, the dative form can mean &quot;for praising&quot;, the accusative form can mean &quot;praising&quot;, and the ablative form can mean &quot;by praising&quot;, &quot;in respect to praising&quot;, etc.
One common use of the gerund is with the preposition to indicate purpose. For example, could be translated as &quot;ready to attack&quot;. However the gerund was avoided when an object was introduced, and a passive construction with the gerundive was preferred. For example, for &quot;ready to attack the enemy&quot; the construction is preferred over .

=== Gerundive ===
The gerundive has a form similar to that of the gerund, but it is a first and second declension adjective, and functions as a future passive participle (see above). It means &quot;(which is) to be ...ed&quot;. Often, the gerundive is used with part of the verb , to show obligation.

* &quot;The boy needs to be praised&quot;
* means &quot;The speech is to be praised&quot;. In such constructions a substantive in dative may be used to identify the agent of the obligation (), as in meaning &quot;The speech is to be praised by us&quot; or &quot;We must praise the speech&quot;.

An older form of the 3rd and 4th conjugation gerundive ends in &quot;-undum&quot;, e.g. ( for ). This ending is also found with the gerundive of &#x27;I go&#x27;: &#x27;it is necessary to go&#x27;.

For some examples of uses of Latin gerundives, see the Gerundive article.

== Periphrastic conjugations ==
There are two periphrastic conjugations. One is active, and the other is passive.

=== Active ===
The first periphrastic conjugation uses the future participle. It is combined with the forms of . It is translated as &quot;I am going to praise,&quot; &quot;I was going to praise&quot;, etc.

=== Passive ===
The second periphrastic conjugation uses the gerundive. It is combined with the forms of and expresses necessity. It is translated as &quot;I am needing to be praised&quot;, &quot;I was needing to be praised&quot;, etc., or as &quot;I have to (&quot;i.e.&quot;, must) be praised&quot;, &quot;I had to be praised,&quot; etc. It may also be translated in English word by word, as in &quot;You are to be (&quot;i.e.&quot;, must be) praised.&quot;
== Peculiarities ==
=== Deponent and semi-deponent verbs ===
Deponent verbs are verbs that are passive in form (that is, conjugated as though in the passive voice) but active in meaning. These verbs have only three principal parts, since the perfect of ordinary passives is formed periphrastically with the perfect participle, which is formed on the same stem as the supine. Some examples coming from all conjugations are:

:1st conjugation: – to admire, wonder
:2nd conjugation: – to promise, offer
:3rd conjugation: – to speak, say
:4th conjugation: – to tell a lie

Deponent verbs use active conjugations for tenses that do not exist in the passive: the gerund, the supine, the present and future participles and the future infinitive. They cannot be used in the passive themselves (except the gerundive), and their analogues with &quot;active&quot; form do not in fact exist: one cannot directly translate &quot;The word is said&quot; with any form of , and there are no forms like &quot;loquō&quot;, &quot;loquis&quot;, &quot;loquit&quot;, etc.

Semi-deponent verbs form their imperfective aspect tenses in the manner of ordinary active verbs; but their perfect tenses are built periphrastically like deponents and ordinary passives; thus, semi-deponent verbs have a perfect active participle instead of a perfect passive participle. An example:

: – to dare, venture

Unlike the proper passive of active verbs, which is always intransitive, some deponent verbs are transitive, which means that they can take an object. For example:

: – he follows the enemy.

Note: In the Romance languages, which lack deponent or passive verb forms, the Classical Latin deponent verbs either disappeared (being replaced with non-deponent verbs of a similar meaning) or changed to a non-deponent form. For example, in Spanish and Italian, changed to &quot;mirar(e)&quot; by changing all the verb forms to the previously nonexistent &quot;active form&quot;, and changed to &quot;osar(e)&quot; by taking the participle and making an &quot;-ar(e)&quot; verb out of it (note that &quot;au&quot; went to &quot;o&quot;).

=== Defective verbs ===
Defective verbs are verbs that are conjugated in only some instances.
*Some verbs are conjugated only in the perfective aspect&#x27;s tenses, yet have the imperfective aspect&#x27;s tenses&#x27; meanings. As such, the perfect becomes the present, the pluperfect becomes the imperfect, and the future perfect becomes the future. Therefore, the defective verb &quot;ōdī&quot; means, &quot;I hate.&quot; These defective verbs&#x27; principal parts are given in vocabulary with the indicative perfect in the first person and the perfect active infinitive. Some examples are:

:: (future participle ) – to hate
:: (imperative ) – to remember
:: – to have begun
*A few verbs, the meanings of which usually have to do with speech, appear only in certain occurrences.

:: (plur. ), which means &quot;Hand it over&quot; is only in the imperative mood, and only is used in the second person.

The following are conjugated irregularly:

==== &quot;Aio&quot; ====
:Present Active Participle: – 

==== &quot;Inquam&quot; ====
==== &quot;For&quot; ====
:Present Active Participle – 
:Present Active Infinitive – (variant: )
:Supine – (acc.) , (abl.) 
:Gerund – (gen.) , (dat. and abl.) , no accusative
:Gerundive – 

The Romance languages lost many of these verbs, but others (such as ) survived but became regular fully conjugated verbs (in Italian, ).

=== Impersonal verbs ===
Impersonal verbs are those lacking a person. In English impersonal verbs are usually used with the neuter pronoun &quot;it&quot; (as in &quot;It seems,&quot; or &quot;it is raining&quot;). Latin uses the third person singular. These verbs lack a fourth principal part. A few examples are:

: – to rain (it rains)
: – to snow (it snows)
: – to be proper (it is proper, one should/ought to)
: – to be permitted [to] (it is allowed [to])

=== Irregular future active participles ===
The future active participle is normally formed by removing the &quot;–um&quot; from the supine, and adding a &quot;–ūrus.&quot; However, some deviations occur.

=== Alternative verb forms ===
Several verb forms may occur in alternative forms (in some authors these forms are fairly common, if not more common than the canonical ones):
*The ending &quot;–ris&quot; in the passive voice may be &quot;–re&quot; as in:
*The ending &quot;–ērunt&quot; in the perfect may be &quot;–ēre&quot; (primarily in poetry) as in:
*The ending &quot;–ī&quot; in the passive infinitive may be &quot;–ier&quot; as in:

=== Syncopated verb forms ===
Like in most Romance languages, syncopated forms and contractions are present in Latin. They may occur in the following instances:
*Perfect stems that end in a &quot;–v&quot; may be contracted when inflected.
:: → 
:: → 
*The compounds of (to learn) and (to move, dislodge) can also be contracted.
:: → 
:: →

<doc id="18002" wikidata="Q185696" url="?curid=18002" title="Louisa May Alcott">
<text>Louisa May Alcott (; November 29, 1832March 6, 1888) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet best known for writing the novel &quot;Little Women&quot; (1868) and its sequels &quot;Good Wives&quot; (1869), &quot;Little Men&quot; (1871), and &quot;Jo&#x27;s Boys&quot; (1886). Raised in New England by her transcendentalist parents, Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott, she grew up among many well-known intellectuals of the day, including Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. Encouraged by her family, Louisa began writing from an early age.

Louisa&#x27;s family experienced financial hardship, and while Louisa took on various jobs to help support the family from an early age, she also sought to earn money by writing. In the 1860s she began to achieve critical success for her writing with the publication of &quot;Hospital Sketches&quot;, a book based on her service as a nurse in the American Civil War. Early in her career, she sometimes used pen names such as A. M. Barnard, under which she wrote lurid short stories and sensation novels for adults. &quot;Little Women&quot; was one of her first successful novels and has been adapted for film and television. It is loosely based on Louisa&#x27;s childhood experiences with her three sisters, Abigail May Alcott Nieriker, Elizabeth Sewall Alcott, and Anna Alcott Pratt.

Louisa was an abolitionist and a feminist and remained unmarried throughout her life. She also spent her life active in reform movements such as temperance and women&#x27;s suffrage. During the last eight years of her life she raised the daughter of her deceased sister. She died from a stroke in Boston on March 6, 1888, just two days after her father&#x27;s death and was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Louisa May Alcott has been the subject of numerous biographies, novels, and a documentary, and has influenced other writers and public figures such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Theodore Roosevelt.

==Early life==

=== Birth and early childhood ===

Louisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832, in Germantown, now part of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her parents were transcendentalist and educator Amos Bronson Alcott and social worker Abigail May. Louisa was the second of four daughters, with Anna as the eldest and Elizabeth and May as the youngest. Louisa was named after her mother&#x27;s sister, Louisa May Greele, who had died four years earlier. After Louisa&#x27;s birth, Bronson kept a record of her development, noting her strong will, which she may have inherited from her mother&#x27;s May side of the family. He described her as &quot;fit for the scuffle of things&quot;.

The family moved to Boston in 1834, where Louisa&#x27;s father established the experimental Temple School and met with other transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Bronson participated in child-care but often failed to provide income, creating conflict in the family. At home and in school he taught morals and improvement, while Abigail emphasized imagination and supported Alcott&#x27;s writing at home. Writing helped her handle her emotions. Louisa was often tended by her father&#x27;s friend Elizabeth Peabody, and later she frequently visited Temple School during the day.

Louisa kept a journal from an early age. Bronson and Abigail often read it and left short messages for her on her pillow. She was a tomboy who preferred boys&#x27; games and preferred to be friends with boys or other tomboys. She wanted to play sports with the boys at school but was not allowed to.

Alcott was primarily educated by her father, who established a strict schedule and believed in &quot;the sweetness of self-denial.&quot; When Louisa was still too young to attend school, Bronson taught her the alphabet by forming the letter shapes with his body and having her repeat their names. For a time she was educated by Sophia Foord, whom she would later eulogize. She was also instructed in biology and Native American history by Thoreau, who was a naturalist, while Emerson mentored her in literature. Louisa had a particular fondness for Thoreau and Emerson; as a young girl, they were both &quot;sources of romantic fantasies for her.&quot; Her favorite authors included Harriet Beecher Stowe, Sir Walter Scott, Fredericka Bremer, Thomas Carlyle, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Goethe, and John Milton, Friedrich Schiller, and Germaine de Staele.

=== Hosmer Cottage ===

In 1840, after several setbacks with Temple School and a brief stay in Scituate, the Alcotts moved to Hosmer Cottage in Concord. Emerson, who had convinced Bronson to move his family to Concord, paid rent for the family, who were often in need of financial help. While living there, Alcott and her sisters befriended the Hosmer, Goodwin, Emerson, Hawthorne, and Channing children, who lived nearby. The Hosmer and Alcott children put on plays and often included other children. Louisa and Anna also attended school at the Concord Academy, though for a time Louisa attended a school for younger children held at the Emerson house. At eight years-old, Louisa wrote her first poem, &quot;To the First Robin&quot;. When she showed the poem to her mother, Abigail was pleased.

In October 1842 Bronson returned from a visit to schools in England and brought Charles Lane and Henry Wright with him to live at Hosmer Cottage, while Bronson and Lane made plans to establish a &quot;New Eden&quot;. The children&#x27;s education was undertaken by Lane, who implemented a strict schedule. Louisa disliked Lane and found the new living arrangements difficult.

=== Fruitlands and Hillside ===

In 1843 Bronson and Lane established Fruitlands, a utopian community, in Harvard, Massachusetts, where the family were to live. Louisa later described these early years in a newspaper sketch titled &quot;Transcendental Wild Oats&quot;, reprinted in &quot;Silver Pitchers&quot; (1876), which relates the family&#x27;s experiment in &quot;plain living and high thinking&quot; at Fruitlands. There, Louisa enjoyed running outdoors and found happiness in writing poetry about her family, elves, and spirits. She later reflected with distaste on the amount of work she had to do outside of her lessons. She also enjoyed playing with Lane&#x27;s son William and often put on fairy-tale plays or performances of Charles Dickens&#x27;s stories. She read works by Dickens, Plutarch, Lord Byron, Maria Edgeworth, and Oliver Goldsmith.

During the demise of Fruitlands, the Alcotts discussed whether or not the family should separate. Louisa recorded this in her journal and expressed her unhappiness should they separate. After the collapse of Fruitlands in early 1844, the family rented in nearby Still River, where Louisa attended public school and wrote and directed plays that her sisters and friends performed.

In April 1845 the family returned to Concord, where they bought a home they called Hillside with money Abigail inherited from her father. Here, Louisa and her sister Anna attended a school run by John Hosmer after a period of home education. The family again lived near the Emersons, and Louisa was granted open access to the Emerson library, where she read Carlyle, Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe. In the summer of 1848 sixteen-year-old Louisa opened a school of twenty students in a barn near Hillside. Her students consisted of the Emerson, Channing, and Alcott children.

The two oldest Alcott girls continued acting in plays written by Louisa. While Anna preferred portraying calm characters, Louisa preferred the roles of villains, knights, and sorcerers. These plays later inspired &quot;Comic Tragedies&quot; (1893). The family struggled without income beyond the girls&#x27; sewing and teaching. Eventually, some friends arranged a job for Abigail and three years after moving into Hillside, the family moved to Boston. Hillside was sold to Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1852. Louisa described the three years she spent at Concord as a child as the &quot;happiest of her life.&quot;

=== Boston ===
When the Alcott family moved to South End, Boston in 1848, Louisa had work as a teacher, seamstress, governess, domestic helper, and laundress, to earn money for the family. Together, Louisa and her sister taught a school in Boston, though Louisa disliked teaching. Her sisters also supported the family by working as seamstresses, while their mother took on social work among the Irish immigrants. Elizabeth and May were able to attend public school, though Elizabeth later left school to undertake the housekeeping. Due to financial pressures, writing became a creative and emotional outlet for Louisa. In 1849 she created a family newspaper, the &quot;Olive Leaf,&quot; named after the local &quot;Olive Branch.&quot; The family newspaper included stories, poems, articles, and housekeeping advice. It was later renamed to &quot;The Portfolio&quot;. She also wrote her first novel, &quot;The Inheritance,&quot; which was published posthumously and based on &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Louisa, who was driven to escape poverty, wrote, &quot;I wish I was rich, I was good, and we were all a happy family this day.&quot;

== Early adulthood ==

===Life in Dedham===
Abigail ran an intelligence office to help the destitute find employment. When James Richardson came to Abigail in the winter of 1851 seeking a companion for his frail sister and elderly father who would also be willing to do light housekeeping, Louisa volunteered to serve in the house filled with books, music, artwork, and good company on Highland Avenue. Louisa may have imagined the experience as something akin to being a heroine in a Gothic novel, as Richardson described their home in a letter as stately but decrepit.Richardson&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth, was 40 years old and suffered from neuralgia. She was shy and did not seem to have much use for Louisa. Instead, Richardson spent hours reading her poetry and sharing his philosophical ideas with her. She reminded Richardson that she was hired to be Elizabeth&#x27;s companion and expressed that she was tired of listening to his &quot;philosophical, metaphysical, and sentimental rubbish.&quot; Richardson&#x27;s response was to assign her more laborious duties, including chopping wood, scrubbing the floors, shoveling snow, drawing water from the well, and blacking his boots.

Louisa quit after seven weeks, when neither of the two girls her mother sent to replace her decided to take the job. As she walked from Richardson&#x27;s home to Dedham station, she opened the envelope he handed her with her pay. One account states that she was so unsatisfied with the four dollars she found inside that she mailed the money back to him in contempt. Another account states that Bronson may have returned the money himself and rebuked Richardson. Louisa later wrote a slightly fictionalized account of her time in Dedham titled &quot;How I Went Out To Service&quot;, which she submitted to Boston publisher James T. Fields. Fields rejected the piece, telling Louisa that she had no future as a writer.

=== Early publications ===
In September 1851 Louisa&#x27;s poem &quot;Sunlight&quot; appeared in &quot;Peterson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; under the name Flora Fairchild, making it her first successful publication. 1852 marked the publication of her first story, &quot;The Rival Painters: A Tale of Rome&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Olive Branch&quot;. In 1854 she attended The Boston Theatre, where she was given a pass to attend free of charge. She published her first book, &quot;Flower Fables,&quot; in 1854; the book was a selection of tales she originally told to Ellen Emerson, daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Lidian Emerson had read the stories and encouraged Louisa to publish them. Though she was pleased, Louisa hoped to eventually shift her writing &quot;from fairies and fables to men and realities&quot;. She also wrote &quot;The Rival Prima Donnas&quot;, a play adaptation of her story with the same title.

In 1855 the Alcotts moved to Walpole, New Hampshire, where Louisa and Anna participated in the Walpole Amateur Dramatic Company. Louisa was praised for her &quot;superior histrionic ability&quot;. At the end of the theater season, Louisa, encouraged by the success of &quot;Flower Fables&quot;, began writing &quot;Christmas Elves&quot;, a collection of Christmas stories illustrated by May Alcott. In November Louisa traveled to Boston and attempted to publish the collection while living with a relative. November was too late in the year to publish Christmas books and Louisa was unable to publish &quot;The Christmas Elves&quot;. She then wrote and published &quot;The Sisters&#x27; Trial&quot;, a story about four women who were based on the Alcott sisters.

=== Family changes ===
Louisa returned to Walpole in mid-1856 to find her sister Elizabeth ill with scarlet fever. Louisa helped nurse Elizabeth, and when she was not nursing helped with the housekeeping and wrote. Louisa prepared to publish &quot;Beach Bubbles&quot; that year, but the book was rejected. By the end of the year she was writing for the &quot;Olive Branch&quot;, the &quot;Ladies Enterprise&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Sunday News&quot;. Louisa again lived in Boston for a time, where she met Julia Ward Howe and Frank Sanborn. In the summer of 1857 Louisa and Anna rejoined the Walpole Amateur Dramatic Company and sought to entertain Elizabeth with stories about their acting. The family later visited Swampscott in an effort to boost Elizabeth&#x27;s health, which was poor from effects of the scarlet fever, but it did not improve. During this time Louisa read &quot;The Life of Charlotte Brontë&quot; by Elizabeth Gaskell and found inspiration from Brontë&#x27;s life. 

The family moved back to Concord in September 1857, where the Alcotts rented while Bronson repaired Orchard House. During that time, the two oldest Alcott sisters organized the Concord Dramatic Union. Elizabeth Alcott died on March 14, 1858, when she was twenty-three. Three weeks later, Anna became engaged to John Pratt, a man she met in the Concord Dramatic Union. Louisa experienced depression about these events and considered Elizabeth&#x27;s death and Anna&#x27;s engagement catalysts to breaking up their sisterhood. After the family moved into Orchard House in July 1858, Louisa again returned to Boston to find employment. Unable to find work and filled with despair, Louisa contemplated suicide by drowning, but she decided to &quot;take Fate by the throat and shake a living out of her.&quot; She eventually received an offer to work as a governess for invalid Alice Lovering, which she accepted.
==Later years==

=== Civil War service ===
As an adult, Louisa Alcott was an abolitionist, temperance advocate, and feminist. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Alcott wanted to enlist in the Union Army but could not because she was a woman. Instead, she sewed uniforms and waited until she reached the minimum age for army nurses at thirty years old. Soon after turning thirty in 1862, Alcott applied to the U. S. Sanitary Commission, run by Dorothea Dix, and on December 11 was assigned to work in the Union Hotel Hospital in Georgetown, Washington, D. C. When she left, Bronson felt as if he was &quot;sending [his] only son to the war&quot;. When she arrived she discovered that conditions in the hospital were poor, with over-crowded and filthy quarters, bad food, unstable beds, and insufficient ventilation. Diseases such as scarlet fever, chicken pox, measles, and typhus were rampant among the patients. Alcott&#x27;s duties included cleaning wounds, feeding the men, assisting with amputations, dressing wounds, and later assigning patients to their wards. She also entertained patients by reading aloud and putting on skits. She served as a nurse for six weeks in 1862–1863. She intended to serve three months, but contracted typhoid fever and became critically ill partway through her service. In late January Bronson traveled to the hospital and took Louisa to Concord to recover.

=== Lulu Nieriker ===
Louisa nursed her mother Abigail, who was dying, in 1877 while writing &quot;Under the Lilacs&quot; (1878). Louisa also became ill and close to dying, so the family moved in with Anna Alcott Pratt, who had recently purchased Thoreau&#x27;s house with Louisa&#x27;s financial support. After Abigail&#x27;s death in November, Louisa and Bronson permanently moved into Anna&#x27;s house. Her sister May was living in London at the time and married Ernest Nieriker four months later. May became pregnant and was due to deliver her child near the end of 1879. Though Louisa wanted to travel to Paris to see May in time for the delivery, she decided against it because her health was poor. On December 29 May died from complications developed after childbirth, and in September 1880 Louisa assumed the care of her niece, Lulu, who was named after her. Nieriker sent the news to Emerson and asked him to share it with Bronson and his daughters. Only Louisa was at home when Emerson arrived; she guessed the news before he told her and shared it with Bronson and Anna after he left. During the grief that followed May&#x27;s death, Louisa and her father Bronson coped by writing poetry. In a letter to her friend Maria S. Porter, Louisa wrote, &quot;Of all the griefs in my life, and I have had many, this is the bitterest.&quot; It was at this time that she completed &quot;Jack and Jill: A Village Story&quot; (1880).

Louisa sometimes hired a nanny when her poor health made it difficult to care for Lulu. While raising Lulu, she published few works. Among her published works at this time are the volumes of &quot;Lulu&#x27;s Library&quot; (1886–1889), collections of stories written for her niece Lulu. When Bronson suffered a stroke in 1882, Louisa became his caretaker. In the years that followed she alternated between living in Concord, Boston, and Nonquitt. In June 1884 Louisa sold Orchard House, which the family was no longer living in.

=== Decline and death ===
Alcott suffered from chronic health problems in her later years, including vertigo, dyspepsia, headaches, fatigue, and pain in the limbs, diagnosed as neuralgia in her lifetime. When conventional medicines did not alleviate her pain, she tried mind-cure treatments, homeopathy, hypnotism, and Christian Science. Her ill health has been attributed to mercury poisoning, morphine intake, intestinal cancer, or meningitis. Alcott herself cited mercury poisoning as the cause of her sickness. When she contracted typhoid fever during her American Civil War service, she was treated with calomel, which is a compound containing mercury. Dr. Norbert Hirschhorn and Dr. Ian Greaves suggest that Alcott&#x27;s chronic health problems may have been associated with an autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, possibly because mercury exposure compromised her immune system. An 1870 portrait of Alcott shows her cheeks to be flushed, perhaps with the butterfly rash that is often characteristic of lupus. The suggested diagnosis, based on Alcott&#x27;s journal entries, cannot be proved.

As Alcott&#x27;s health declined, she often lived at Dunreath Place, a convalescent home run by Dr. Rhoda Lawrence for which she had provided financial support in the past. Eventually a doctor advised Alcott to stop writing to preserve her health. In 1887 she legally adopted Anna&#x27;s son, John Pratt, and made him heir to her royalties, then created a will that left her money to her remaining family. Alcott visited Bronson at his deathbed on March 1, 1888, and expressed the wish that she could join him in death. On March 3, the day before her father died, she suffered a stroke and went unconscious, in which state she remained until her death on March 6, 1888. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, near Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau, on a hillside now known as Authors&#x27; Ridge. Her niece Lulu was eight years old when Alcott died and was cared for by Anna Alcott Pratt for two years before reuniting with her father in Europe.

==Literary success==

=== Works ===
In 1859 Alcott began writing for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Encouraged by Sanborn and Moncure Conway, Louisa revised and published the letters she wrote while serving as a nurse in the Boston anti-slavery paper &quot;Commonwealth,&quot; later collecting them as &quot;Hospital Sketches&quot; (1863, republished with additions in 1869). She planned to travel to South Carolina to teach freed slaves and write letters she could later publish, but she was too ill to travel and abandoned the plan. Soon after the success of &quot;Hospital Sketches,&quot; Alcott published her novel &quot;Moods&quot; (1864), based on her own experience with and stance on &quot;woman&#x27;s right to selfhood.&quot; Louisa struggled to find a publisher because the novel was long. After abridgments, &quot;Moods&quot; was published and popular. In 1882 Alcott changed the end. While touring Europe in 1870, she was displeased to find out that her publisher released a new edition without her approval.
Louisa Alcott began editing the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Merry&#x27;s Museum&quot; to help pay off family debts incurred while she toured Europe as the companion of wealthy invalid Anna Weld in 1865–66. Though Louisa disliked editing the magazine, she became its main editor in 1867. Around the same time, Alcott&#x27;s publisher, Thomas Niles, asked her to write a book especially for girls. She was hesitant to write it because she felt she knew more about boys than she did about girls, but she eventually set to work on her semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy&quot; (1868). Alcott developed a close relationship with the young Polish revolutionary Ladislas Wisniewski during her European tour with Weld. She met him in Vevey, where he taught her French and she taught him English. She detailed a romance between herself and Wisniewski but later took it out. Alcott identified Wisniewski as one of the models for the character Laurie in &quot;Little Women&quot;. Her other model for Laurie was fifteen-year-old Alfred Whitman, who she met shortly before the death of her sister Elizabeth and with whom she corresponded for several years afterward. She based the heroine Jo on herself, and other characters were based on people from Alcott&#x27;s life. Later Niles asked Alcott to write a second part. Also known as &quot;Good Wives&quot; (1869), it follows the March sisters into adulthood and marriage.

In 1870 Louisa joined May and a friend on a European tour. Though numerous publishers requested new stories, Louisa wrote little while in Europe, instead preferring to rest. Meanwhile, rumors began to spread that she had died from diphtheria. She eventually described their travels in &quot;Shawl Straps&quot; (1872). While in Europe, Louisa began writing &quot;Little Men&quot; after finding out that her brother-in-law, John Pratt, had died. She was driven to write the book to provide financial support for her sister Anna and her two sons. Louisa felt that she &quot;must be a father now&quot; to her nephews. After she left Europe, the book was released the day she arrived in Boston. Louisa took seven years to complete &quot;Jo&#x27;s Boys&quot; (1886), her sequel to &quot;Little Men&quot;. She began the book in 1879 but discontinued it after her sister May&#x27;s death in December. Louisa resumed work on the novel in 1882 after Mary Mapes Dodge of &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; asked for a new serial. &quot;Jo&#x27;s Boys&quot; (1886) completed the &quot;March Family Saga&quot;, Louisa&#x27;s best-known books. The general popularity of her first few published works surprised Alcott. Throughout her career as a writer, she shied away from public attention, sometimes acting as a servant when fans came to her house.

=== Critical reception ===
Before her death, Louisa asked her sister Anna Pratt to destroy her letters and journals; Anna destroyed some and gave the remaining ones to family friend Ednah Dow Cheney. In 1889 Cheney was the first person to undergo a deep study of Alcott&#x27;s life, compiling the journals and letters to publish &quot;Louisa May Alcott: Her Life, Letters, and Journals.&quot; The compilation has been published multiple times since then. Cheney also published &quot;Louisa May Alcott: The Children&#x27;s Friend,&quot; which focused on Alcott&#x27;s appeal to children. Other various compilations of Alcott&#x27;s letters were published in the following decades. In 1909 Belle Moses wrote &quot;Louisa May Alcott, Dreamer and Worker: A Study of Achievement,&quot; which established itself as the &quot;first major biography&quot; about Alcott. Katharine S. Anthony&#x27;s &quot;Louisa May Alcott,&quot; written in 1938, was the first biography to focus on Alcott&#x27;s psychology. A comprehensive biography about Alcott was not written until Madeleine B. Stern&#x27;s 1950 &quot;Louisa May Alcott&quot;. In the 1960s and 1970s, feminist analysis of Alcott&#x27;s fiction increased; analysis of her works also focused on the contrast between her domestic and sensation fiction.

Martha Saxton&#x27;s 1978 &quot;Louisa May: A Modern Biography of Louisa May Alcott&quot; depicts Alcott&#x27;s life in a manner that Karen Halttunen, a professor of History and American Studies at the University of Southern California, called &quot;controversial&quot;. Alcott biographer Ruth K. MacDonald considered Saxton&#x27;s biography to be excessively psychoanalytical, portraying Alcott as a victim to her family. MacDonald also praised Saxton&#x27;s description of Alcott&#x27;s acquaintance with several intellectuals of the time. MacDonald praised Sarah Elbert&#x27;s 1984 biography &quot;A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott and Little Women&quot; for its combination of Saxton&#x27;s psychological perspective and Madelon Bedell&#x27;s larger discussion of the Alcott family from &quot;The Alcotts: Biography of a Family&quot;. She also stated that the biography could use more analysis of Alcott&#x27;s works. Kate Beaird Meyers of the University of Tulsa felt that the 1987 version, entitled &quot;A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s Place in American Culture&quot;, &quot;is much more sophisticated&quot; because Elbert drew upon other scholars and placed Alcott within American literature. Alcott scholar Daniel Shealy compiled and edited &quot;Alcott in Her Own Time&quot;. Roberta Trites called it &quot;fascinating and thorough&quot;, though she said it needed more background information about the essayists, while fellow Alcott scholar Gregory Eiselein praised Shealy&#x27;s use of original accounts. Trites called Harriet Reisen&#x27;s biography &quot;Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women&quot; &quot;far more balanced than some of her predecessors[&#x27;] in that ... she follows John Matteson&#x27;s lead in demonstrating how emotionally complex the relationship was between Alcott&#x27;s parents and their daughters.&quot; She was referring to John Matteson&#x27;s &quot;Eden&#x27;s Outcasts: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and Her Father&quot;, which won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Taylor Barnes of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; generally praised Reisen&#x27;s biography but wrote that its &quot;microscopic examination&quot; of Alcott&#x27;s life becomes confusing. Cornelia Meigs&#x27;s 1934 biography &quot;Invincible Louisa: The Story of the Author of Little Women&quot; won the Newbery Medal. &quot;Critical Insights: Louisa May Alcott&quot;, edited by Gregory Eiselein and Anne K. Phillips, contains a series of essays discussing Alcott&#x27;s life and literature.

== Genres and style ==

=== Sensation and adult fiction ===
Alcott preferred writing sensation stories and novels more than domestic fiction, confiding in her journal, &quot;I fancy &#x27;lurid&#x27; things&quot;. They were influenced by the works of other writers such as Goethe, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. The stories follow themes of incest, murder, suicide, psychology, secret identities, and sensuality. Her characters are often involved in opium experimentation or mind control and sometimes experience insanity, with males and females contending for dominance. The female characters push back against the Cult of Domesticity and explore its counter ideals, Real Womanhood. Important to Alcott&#x27;s income because they paid well, these sensation stories were published in &quot;The Flag of Our Union&quot;, &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Chimney Corner&quot;, and &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot;. Her thrillers were usually published anonymously or with the pseudonym A. M. Barnard. J. R. Elliott of &quot;The Flag&quot; repeatedly asked her to contribute pieces under her own name, but she continued using pseudonyms. Louisa May Alcott scholar Leona Rostenberg suggests that she published these stories under pseudonyms to preserve her reputation as an author of realistic and juvenile fiction. Researching for his dissertation in 2021, doctorate candidate Max Chapnick discovered a possible new pseudonym, E. H. Gould. Chapnick found a story referenced in Alcott&#x27;s personal records in the &quot;Olive Branch,&quot; published under the name E.H. Gould. While Chapnick is uncertain if the pseudonym conclusively belongs to Alcott, other stories he found include references to people and places in her life.

American studies professor Catherine Ross Nickerson credits Alcott with creating one of the earliest works of detective fiction in American literature—preceded only by Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; and his other Auguste Dupin stories—with her 1865 thriller &quot;V.V., or Plots and Counterplots.&quot; The story, which she published anonymously, concerns a Scottish aristocrat who tries to prove that a mysterious woman has killed his fiancée and cousin. The detective on the case, Antoine Dupres, is a parody of Poe&#x27;s Dupin who is less concerned with solving the crime than in setting up a way to reveal the solution with a dramatic flourish. Alcott&#x27;s gothic thrillers remained undiscovered until the 1940s and were not published in collections until the 1970s.

Alcott&#x27;s adult novels were not as popular as she wished them to be. They lack the optimism of her juvenile fiction and explore difficult marriages, women&#x27;s rights, and conflict between men and women.

=== Juvenile and domestic fiction ===
Alcott had little interest in writing for children, but saw it as a good financial opportunity. She felt that writing children&#x27;s literature was tedious. Alcott biographer Ruth K. MacDonald suggests that Alcott&#x27;s hesitance to write children&#x27;s novels may have arisen from the societal perception that writing for children was a means by which poor women made money. Her juvenile fiction portrays both women who fit Victorian ideals of domesticity and women who have careers and decide to remain single. In her domestic stories she focuses on women and children as characters, and some of the adult characters discuss social reform, such as women&#x27;s rights. The child protagonists are often flawed, and the stories include didactics. Though her juvenile fiction is largely based on her childhood, she does not focus on the poverty her family experienced.

=== Style ===
Alcott&#x27;s writing has been described as &quot;episodic&quot; because the narratives are broken into distinctive events with little connective tissue. Her early work is modeled after Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s work. The style and ideas that appear in her writing are also influenced by her transcendental upbringing, both promoting and satirizing transcendentalist ideals. As a realist writer, she explores social conflict; she also promotes advanced views on education. She incorporates slang into her characters&#x27; dialogue, which contemporaries criticized her for doing. She also uses intertextuality by frequently including references to plays and well-known statues, among other things.

== Social involvement ==

=== Abolition ===
When Alcott was young, her family served as station masters on the Underground Railroad and housed fugitive slaves. Alcott was unable to dictate when she first became an abolitionist, suggesting that she became an abolitionist either when William Lloyd Garrison was attacked for his abolitionist efforts or when a young African-American boy saved her from drowning in Frog Pond. Both events occurred when Alcott was a child. Alcott formed her abolitionist ideas, in part, from listening to conversations between her father and uncle Samuel May or between her father and Emerson. She was also inspired by the abolitionism of Rev. Theodore Parker, Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, and William Lloyd Garrison, with whom she was acquainted. She also knew Frederick Douglass in adulthood. As a young woman Louisa joined her family in teaching African-Americans how to read and write. When John Brown was executed on December 2, 1859, for his involvement in anti-slavery, Alcott described it as &quot;the execution of Saint John the Just&quot;. Alcott attended several abolitionist rallies, including a rally at Tremont Temple that advocated for Thomas Simm&#x27;s freedom. She also believed in the full integration of African-Americans into society. She wrote multiple anti-slavery stories such as &quot;M. L.&quot;, &quot;My Contraband&quot;, and &quot;An Hour&quot;. According to Sarah Elbert, Alcott&#x27;s anti-slavery stories show her regard for Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s anti-slavery works.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
After her mother&#x27;s death, Louisa committed to following her example by actively advocating for women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1877, Alcott helped found the Women&#x27;s Educational and Industrial Union in Boston. She read and admired the Declaration of Sentiments published by the Seneca Falls Convention on women&#x27;s rights, and became the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts in a school board election on March 9, 1879. She encouraged other Concord women to vote and was disappointed when few did. Alcott became a member of the National Congress of the Women of the United States while attending the Woman&#x27;s Congress in 1875 and later recounted it in &quot;My Girls&quot;. She gave speeches advocating women&#x27;s rights and eventually convinced her publisher Thomas Niles to publish suffragist writings. She advocated for dress and diet reform as well as for women to receive college education, sometimes signing her letters with &quot;Yours for reform of all kinds&quot;. Alcott also signed the &quot;Appeal to Republican Women in Massachusetts&quot;, a petition that attempted to secure the vote for women.

Along with Elizabeth Stoddard, Rebecca Harding Davis, Anne Moncure Crane, and others, Alcott was part of a group of female authors during the Gilded Age who addressed women&#x27;s issues in a modern and candid manner. Their works were, as one newspaper columnist of the period commented, &quot;among the decided &#x27;signs of the times&#x27;&quot;. Alcott also joined Sorosis, where members discussed health and dress reform for women, and she helped found Concord&#x27;s first temperance society. Between 1874 and 1887 many of her works, published in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, discussed women&#x27;s suffrage. Her essay &quot;Happy Women&quot; in &quot;The New York Ledger&quot; argued that women did not need to marry. She explained her spinsterhood in an interview with Louise Chandler Moulton, saying, &quot;I am more than half-persuaded that I am a man&#x27;s soul put by some freak of nature into a woman&#x27;s body... because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.&quot; After her death, Alcott was memorialized during a suffragist meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio.
== Legacy ==
=== Alcott homes ===
The Alcotts&#x27; Concord home, Orchard House, where the family lived for 25 years and where &quot;Little Women&quot; was written, is open to the public and pays homage to the Alcotts by focusing on public education and historic preservation. The Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association, which was founded in 1911 and runs the museum, allows tourists to walk through the house and learn about Louisa May Alcott. Her Boston home is featured on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

=== Film and television ===
&quot;Little Women&quot; inspired film versions in 1933, 1949, 1994, 2018, and 2019. The novel also inspired television series in 1958, 1970, 1978, and 2017, anime versions in 1981 and 1987, and a 2005 musical. It also inspired a BBC Radio 4 version in 2017. &quot;Little Men&quot; inspired film versions in 1934, 1940, and 1998, and was the basis for a 1998 television series. Other films based on Louisa May Alcott novels and stories are &quot;An Old-Fashioned Girl&quot; (1949), &quot;The Inheritance&quot; (1997), and &quot;An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving&quot; (2008). &quot;Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind &#x27;Little Women&#x27;&quot; aired in 2009 as part of the &quot;American Masters&quot; biography series and was aired a second time on May 20, 2018. It was directed by Nancy Porter and written by Harriet Reisen, who wrote the script based on primary sources from Alcott&#x27;s life. The documentary, which starred Elizabeth Marvel as Louisa, was shot onsite for the events it covered. It included interviews with Louisa May Alcott scholars, including Sarah Elbert, Daniel Shealy, Madeleine Stern, Leona Rostenberg, and Geraldine Brooks.

=== Popular culture ===
Alcott appears as the protagonist in the &quot;Louisa May Alcott Mystery&quot; series, written by Jeanne Mackin under the pseudonym Anna Maclean. In book one, &quot;Louisa and the Missing Heiress&quot;, Louisa is living in Boston in 1854 and writing her sensation stories. She finds the dead body of a fictional friend who recently returned from a honeymoon and solves the mystery. &quot;Louisa and the Country Bachelor&quot; follows Louisa as she visits cousins in Walpole, New Hampshire, in the summer of 1855 and discovers the dead body of an immigrant bachelor. Louisa decides to solve what she suspects is a murder. In &quot;Louisa and the Crystal Gazer&quot;, the third and final book in the series, she solves the murder of a divination woman in Boston in 1855.

&quot;The Lost Summer of Louisa May Alcott&quot; by Kelly O&#x27;Connor McNees takes place in Walpole in 1855 and follows Louisa as she finds romance. Louisa falls in love with a fictional character named Joseph Singer but chooses to pursue a profession as a writer instead of continuing her relationship with Singer. In &quot;Only Gossip Prospers&quot; by Lorraine Tosiello, Louisa visits New York City shortly after publishing &quot;Little Women&quot;. During her trip, Louisa seeks to remain anonymous because of an unrevealed circumstance from her past. &quot;The Revelation of Louisa May Alcott&quot; by Michaela MacColl takes place in 1846; young Louisa solves the murder of a slave catcher. Patricia O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;The Glory Cloak&quot; tells of a fictional friendship between Louisa and Clara Barton, Louisa&#x27;s work in the Civil War, and her relationships with Thoreau and her father. The epistolary novel &quot;The Bee and the Fly: The Improbable Correspondence of Louisa May Alcott and Emily Dickinson,&quot; by Lorraine Tosiello and Jane Cavolina, follows a fictional correspondence between Louisa and Dickinson, which Dickinson initiates in 1861 by asking Louisa for literary advice.

=== Influence ===
Various modern writers have been influenced and inspired by Alcott&#x27;s work, particularly &quot;Little Women&quot;. As a child, Simone de Beauvior felt a connection to Jo and expressed, &quot;Reading this novel gave me an exalted sense of myself. Cynthia Ozick calls herself a &quot;Jo-of-the-future&quot;, and Patti Smith explains, &quot;[I]t was Louisa May Alcott who provided me with a positive view of my female destiny.&quot; Writers influenced by Louisa May Alcott include Ursula K. Le Guin, Barbara Kingsolver, Gail Mazur, Anna Quindlen, Anne Lamott, Sonia Sanchez, Ann Petry, Gertrude Stein, and J. K. Rowling. U. S. president Theodore Roosevelt said he &quot;worshiped&quot; Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s books. Other politicians who have been impacted by her books include Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Hillary Clinton, and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. Louisa May Alcott was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1996.

<text>In computer science, an LALR parser (look-ahead, left-to-right, rightmost derivation parser) is part of the compiling process where human readable text is converted into a structured representation to be read by computers. An LALR parser is a software tool to process (parse) text into a very specific internal representation that other programs, such as compilers, can work with. This process happens according to a set of production rules specified by a formal grammar for a computer language. 

An LALR parser is a simplified version of a canonical LR parser.

The LALR parser was invented by Frank DeRemer in his 1969 PhD dissertation, &quot;Practical Translators for LR(k) languages&quot;, in his treatment of the practical difficulties at that time of implementing LR(1) parsers. He showed that the LALR parser has more language recognition power than the LR(0) parser, while requiring the same number of states as the LR(0) parser for a language that can be recognized by both parsers. This makes the LALR parser a memory-efficient alternative to the LR(1) parser for languages that are LALR. It was also proven that there exist LR(1) languages that are not LALR. Despite this weakness, the power of the LALR parser is sufficient for many mainstream computer languages, including Java, though the reference grammars for many languages fail to be LALR due to being ambiguous.

The original dissertation gave no algorithm for constructing such a parser given a formal grammar. The first algorithms for LALR parser generation were published in 1973. In 1982, DeRemer and Tom Pennello published an algorithm that generated highly memory-efficient LALR parsers. LALR parsers can be automatically generated from a grammar by an LALR parser generator such as Yacc or GNU Bison. The automatically generated code may be augmented by hand-written code to augment the power of the resulting parser.

== History ==

In 1965, Donald Knuth invented the LR parser (Left to Right, Rightmost derivation). The LR parser can recognize any deterministic context-free language in linear-bounded time. Rightmost derivation has very large memory requirements and implementing an LR parser was impractical due to the limited memory of computers at that time. To address this shortcoming, in 1969, Frank DeRemer proposed two simplified versions of the LR parser, namely the Look-Ahead LR (LALR) and the Simple LR parser (SLR) that had much lower memory requirements at the cost of less language-recognition power, with the LALR parser being the most-powerful alternative. In 1977, memory optimizations for the LR parser were invented but still the LR parser was less memory-efficient than the simplified alternatives.

In 1979, Frank DeRemer and Tom Pennello announced a series of optimizations for the LALR parser that would further improve its memory efficiency. Their work was published in 1982.

== Overview ==
Generally, the LALR parser refers to the LALR(1) parser, just as the LR parser generally refers to the LR(1) parser. The &quot;(1)&quot; denotes one-token lookahead, to resolve differences between rule patterns during parsing. Similarly, there is an LALR(2) parser with two-token lookahead, and LALR(&quot;k&quot;) parsers with &quot;k&quot;-token lookup, but these are rare in actual use. The LALR parser is based on the LR(0) parser, so it can also be denoted LALR(1) = LA(1)LR(0) (1 token of lookahead, LR(0)) or more generally LALR(&quot;k&quot;) = LA(&quot;k&quot;)LR(0) (k tokens of lookahead, LR(0)). There is in fact a two-parameter family of LA(&quot;k&quot;)LR(&quot;j&quot;) parsers for all combinations of &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, which can be derived from the LR(&quot;j&quot; + &quot;k&quot;) parser, but these do not see practical use.

As with other types of LR parsers, an LALR parser is quite efficient at finding the single correct bottom-up parse in a single left-to-right scan over the input stream, because it does not need to use backtracking. Being a lookahead parser by definition, it always uses a lookahead, with being the most-common case.

== Relation to other parsers ==

=== LR parsers ===
The LALR(1) parser is less powerful than the LR(1) parser, and more powerful than the SLR(1) parser, though they all use the same production rules. The simplification that the LALR parser introduces consists in merging rules that have identical kernel item sets, because during the LR(0) state-construction process the lookaheads are not known. This reduces the power of the parser because not knowing the lookahead symbols can confuse the parser as to which grammar rule to pick next, resulting in reduce/reduce conflicts. All conflicts that arise in applying a LALR(1) parser to an unambiguous LR(1) grammar are reduce/reduce conflicts. The SLR(1) parser performs further merging, which introduces additional conflicts.

The standard example of an LR(1) grammar that cannot be parsed with the LALR(1) parser, exhibiting such a reduce/reduce conflict, is:
 S → a E c
 → a F d
 → b F c
 → b E d
 E → e
 F → e

In the LALR table construction, two states will be merged into one state and later the lookaheads will be found to be ambiguous. The one state with lookaheads is:

 E → e. {c,d}
 F → e. {c,d}

An LR(1) parser will create two different states (with non-conflicting lookaheads), neither of which is ambiguous. In an LALR parser this one state has conflicting actions (given lookahead c or d, reduce to E or F), a &quot;reduce/reduce conflict&quot;; the above grammar will be declared ambiguous by a LALR parser generator and conflicts will be reported.

To recover, this ambiguity is resolved by choosing E, because it occurs before F in the grammar. However, the resultant parser will not be able to recognize the valid input sequence codice_1, since the ambiguous sequence codice_2 is reduced to codice_3, rather than the correct codice_4, but codice_5 is not in the grammar.

=== LL parsers ===
The LALR(&quot;j&quot;) parsers are incomparable with LL(&quot;k&quot;) parsers: for any &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; both greater than 0, there are LALR(&quot;j&quot;) grammars that are not LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammars and vice versa. In fact, it is undecidable whether a given LL(1) grammar is LALR(&quot;k&quot;) for any formula_1.

Depending on the presence of empty derivations, a LL(1) grammar can be equal to a SLR(1) or a LALR(1) grammar. If the LL(1) grammar has no empty derivations it is SLR(1) and if all symbols with empty derivations have non-empty derivations it is LALR(1). If symbols having only an empty derivation exist, the grammar may or may not be LALR(1).

<text>In neuroscience and psychology, the term language center refers collectively to the areas of the brain which serve a particular function for speech processing and production. Language is a core system that gives humans the capacity to solve difficult problems and provides them with a unique type of social interaction. Language allows individuals to attribute symbols (e.g. words or signs) to specific concepts, and utilize them through sentences and phrases that follow proper grammatical rules. Finally, speech is the mechanism by which language is orally expressed.

Information is exchanged in a larger system, including language-related regions. These regions are connected by white matter fiber tracts that make possible the transmission of information between regions. The white matter fiber bunches were recognized to be important for language production after suggesting that it is possible to make a connection between multiple language centers. The three classical language areas that are involved in language production and processing are Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s areas, and the angular gyrus.

== Broca&#x27;s area ==

Broca&#x27;s Area was first suggested to play a role in speech function by the French neurologist and anthropologist Paul Broca in 1861. The basis for this discovery was analyzing speech problems resulting from injuries to this brain region, located in the inferior frontal gyrus. Paul Broca had a patient called Leborgne who could only pronounce the word &quot;tan&quot; when speaking. After working with another patient with a similar impairment, Paul Broca concluded that damage in the inferior frontal gyrus affected articulate language.

Broca&#x27;s area is well known for being the syntactic processing &quot;center&quot;. It has been known of since Paul Broca associated speech production with an area in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus, which he called &quot;Broca&#x27;s area&quot;. Although this area is in charge of speech production, the specific details of its role in the language system is unknown. However, it is involved in phonological, semantic, and syntactic processing, and working memory. The anterior region of Broca&#x27;s area is involved in semantic processing, while the posterior region involves phonological processing (Bohsali, 2015). The whole of Broca&#x27;s area has been shown to have a higher activation while doing reading tasks than other types of tasks.

In a simple explanation of speech production, this area approaches phonological word representation chronologically divided into segments of syllables which then is sent to different motor areas where they are converted into a phonetic code. The study of how this area produces speech has been made with paradigms using both single and complex words.

Broca&#x27;s area is correlated with phonological segmentation, unification, and syntactic processing, all connected to linguistic information. This area, although it synchronizes the transformation of information within cortical systems involved in spoken word production, does not contribute to the production of single words. The inferior frontal lobe is the one in charge of word production.

Furthermore, Broca&#x27;s area is structurally related to the thalamus, and both are engaged in language processing. The connectivity between both areas is two thalamic nuclei, the pulvinar, and the ventral nucleus, which are involved in language processing and linguistic functions similar to BA 44 and 45 in Broca&#x27;s area. Pulvinar is connected to many frontal regions of the frontal cortex and the ventral nucleus is involved in speech production. The frontal speech regions of the brain have been shown to participate in speech sound perception.

Broca&#x27;s Area is today still considered an important language center, playing a central role in processing syntax, grammar, and sentence structure.

== Wernicke&#x27;s area ==
Wernicke&#x27;s area was named for German doctor Carl Wernicke, who discovered it in 1874 in the course of his research into aphasias (loss of ability to speak). This area of the brain is involved in language comprehension. Therefore, Wernicke&#x27;s area is for understanding oral language. Besides Wernicke&#x27;s area, the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and angular gyrus (AG) participate in language comprehension. Therefore, language comprehension is not located in a specific area. Contrarily, it involves large regions of the inferior parietal lobe and left temporal.

While the finale of speech production is a sequence of muscle movements, activating knowledge about the sequence of phonemes (consonants and vowel speech sounds) that creates a word is a phonological retrieval. Wernicke&#x27;s area contributes to phonological retrieval. All speech production tasks (e.g. word retrieval, repetition, and reading aloud) require phonological retrieval. The phonological retrieval system involved in speech repetition is the auditory phoneme perception system, and the visual letter perception system is the one that serves for reading aloud. Communicative speech production entails a phase preceding phonological retrieval. Speech comprehension involves mapping sequences of phonemes onto word meaning.

== Angular gyrus ==

The angular gyrus is important in processing concrete and abstract concepts. It also has a role in verbal working memory during retrieval of verbal information and in visual memory when turning written language into spoken language. The left AG is activated in semantic processing that requires concept retrieval and conceptual integration. Also, the left AG is activated during problems of multiplication and addition requiring return of arithmetic factors in verbal memory. Thus, it is involved in verbal coding of numbers.

== Insular cortex ==

The insula is implicated in speech and language, taking part in functional and structural connections with motor neurons, linguistic, sensory, and limbic brain areas. The knowledge about the function of the insula in speech production comes from different studies with patients having speech apraxia. These studies have led researchers to learn of the involvement of different parts of the insula. These parts are the left anterior insula, which is related to speech production, and the bilateral anterior insula, which is involved in misleading speech comprehension.

== Speech and language disorders ==
Many different sources state that the study of the brain, and therefore, language disorders, originated in the 19th century, and linguistic analysis of those disorders began in the 20th century. Studying language impairments in the brain after injuries aids in comprehending how the brain works and changes after an injury. When this happens, the brain&#x27;s impairment is referred to as &quot;aphasia&quot;. Lesions to Broca&#x27;s Area results primarily in disruptions to speech production; damage to Wernicke&#x27;s Area, which is located in the lower part of the temporal lobe, leads mainly to disruptions in speech reception.

There are numerous distinctive ways in which language can be affected. Phonemic paraphasia, an attribute of conduction aphasia and Wernicke aphasia, does not involve speech comprehension impairment. Instead, it requires speech production damage, where the desired phonemes are selected erroneously or in an incorrect sequence. Therefore, although Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, a combination of phonological retrieval and semantic systems impairment, affects speech comprehension, it also involves speech production damage. Phonemic paraphasia and anomia (impaired word retrieval) are the results of phonological retrieval impairment.

Another lesion that involves impairment in language production and processing is apraxia of speech, a difficulty synchronizing articulators essential for speech production. This type of lesion is located in the superior pre-central gyrus of the insula, and is more likely to occur in patients with Broca&#x27;s aphasia. Lesions of the dominant ventral anterior nucleus may result in semantic paraphasias and difficulty in word-finding. Also, individuals with thalamic lesions experience difficulties linking semantic concepts with correct phonological representations in word production.

Dyslexia is a language-processing disorder. It involves learning difficulties in reading, writing, word recognition, phonological recording, numeracy, and spelling. Even with access to appropriate intervention during childhood, these difficulties continue throughout the lifespan. Children are diagnosed with dyslexia when more than one factor affecting learning (e.g. reading or writing) appears. When children diagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in concrete cognitive functioning, this is called an assumption of specificity, and it aids in the diagnosis of dyslexia.

Some characteristics that distinguish dyslexics include errors in phonological processing, causing misreading of unfamiliar words, affecting comprehension; inadequacy of working memory, affecting speaking, reading, and writing; errors in oral reading; oral skill difficulties such as expressing oneself; and writing skill problems in areas such as spelling and general expression. Dyslexics not only experience learning difficulties, but also other secondary characteristics, such as having difficulties in organizing, planning, social interaction, motor skills, visual perception, and short-term memory. These characteristics affect personal and academic life.

Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder caused by damage to the central and/or peripheral nervous system, and it is related to degenerative neurological diseases, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dysarthria can be caused by a mechanical difficulty in the vocal cords, or neurological disease, and produces abnormal articulation of phonemes, such as using &quot;b&quot; in place of &quot;p&quot;. Apraxic dysarthria is a type of dyspraxia that involves distortions of words. This type is related to facial apraxia and motor aphasia if Broca&#x27;s area is involved.

== Current scientific consensus ==
Improvement in computer technology in the late 20th century has allowed a better understanding of the correlation between brain and language, in the disorders that this entails. This improvement has permitted better visualization of the brain structure in high-resolution three-dimensional images. It has also allowed observation of brain activity through blood flow (Dronkers, Ivanova, &amp; Baldo, 2017).

New medical imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI have allowed researchers to generate pictures showing which areas of a living brain are active at a given time. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) localizes specific brain functions to particular brain regions by observing blood flow in different areas. This technique shows the location and magnitude of neural activity variations, influenced by external stimulation and fluctuation at rest. MRI is a technique that was developed in the 20th century to observe brain activity in healthy and abnormal brains. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is a technique used for tracking white matter bundles &quot;in vivo&quot;, and gives information on the internal fibrous structure via measuring water diffusion. This diffusion tensor is used for inferring white matter connectivity.

In the past, research was primarily based on observations of loss of ability resulting from damage to the cerebral cortex. In the modern era, medical imaging has represented a radical step forward for research on speech processing. It is now known that a whole series of relatively large brain areas are involved in speech processing. In more recent research, subcortical regions (those lying below the cerebral cortex such as the putamen and the caudate nucleus), as well as the pre-motor areas (BA 6), have received increased attention. It is now generally assumed that the following structures of the cerebral cortex near the primary and secondary auditory cortices play a fundamental role in speech processing:

* Superior temporal gyrus (STG): morphosyntactic processing (anterior section), integration of syntactic and semantic information (posterior section)

* Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Brodmann area (BA) 45/47): syntactic processing, working memory

* Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, BA 44): syntactic processing, working memory

* Middle temporal gyrus (MTG): lexical semantic processing

* Angular gyrus (AG): semantic processes (posterior temporal cortex)

The left hemisphere is usually dominant in right-handed people, although bilateral activations are not uncommon in syntactic processing. It is now accepted that the right hemisphere plays an important role in the processing of suprasegmental acoustic features like prosody, which is &quot;the rhythmic and melodic variations in speech&quot;. There are two types of prosodic information: emotional prosody (right hemisphere), which is the emotional content of the speech, and linguistic prosody (left hemisphere), the syntactic and thematic structure of the speech.

Most areas of speech processing develop in the second year of life in the dominant half (hemisphere) of the brain, which often (though not necessarily) corresponds to the opposite of the dominant hand. 98% of right-handed people are left-hemisphere dominant, and the majority of left-handed people are as well.

Computerized tomographic (CT) scans are a technique dating to the 1970s, and produce low spatial resolution, but are capable of providing the location of injuries &quot;in vivo&quot;. Also, Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) techniques have contributed to the understanding that specific brain regions have different roles when supporting speech processing. VLSM has been used to observe complex language functions supported by multiple brain regions. VBM is a helpful technique for analyzing language impairments related to neurodegenerative disease.

== Older models ==

The differentiation of speech production into only two large sections of the brain (i.e. Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s areas), which was accepted long before medical imaging techniques, is now considered outdated. Broca&#x27;s area was first suggested to play a role in speech function by the French neurologist and anthropologist Paul Broca in 1861. The basis for this discovery was the analysis of speech problems resulting from injuries to this brain region, located in the inferior frontal gyrus. Lesions to Broca&#x27;s Area result primarily in disruptions to speech production. 

Damage to Wernicke&#x27;s area, located in the lower part of the temporal lobe, mainly leads to speech reception disruptions. This area was named for German doctor Carl Wernicke, who discovered it in 1874 in the course of his research into aphasias (loss of ability to speak).

Broca&#x27;s area is today still considered an important language center, playing a central role in processing syntax, grammar, and sentence structure.

<doc id="18009" wikidata="Q194433" url="?curid=18009" title="Lift (force)">
<text>When a fluid flows around an object, the fluid exerts a force on the object. Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction. It contrasts with the drag force, which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction. Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of gravity, but it is defined to act perpendicular to the flow and therefore can act in any direction.

If the surrounding fluid is air, the force is called an aerodynamic force. In water or any other liquid, it is called a hydrodynamic force.

Dynamic lift is distinguished from other kinds of lift in fluids. Aerostatic lift or buoyancy, in which an internal fluid is lighter than the surrounding fluid, does not require movement and is used by balloons, blimps, dirigibles, boats, and submarines. Planing lift, in which only the lower portion of the body is immersed in a liquid flow, is used by motorboats, surfboards, windsurfers, sailboats, and water-skis.

==Overview==

A fluid flowing around the surface of a solid object applies a force on it. It does not matter whether the object is moving through a stationary fluid (e.g. an aircraft flying through the air) or whether the object is stationary and the fluid is moving (e.g. a wing in a wind tunnel) or whether both are moving (e.g. a sailboat using the wind to move forward). Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction. Lift is always accompanied by a drag force, which is the component of the surface force parallel to the flow direction.

Lift is mostly associated with the wings of fixed-wing aircraft, although it is more widely generated by many other streamlined bodies such as propellers, kites, helicopter rotors, racing car wings, maritime sails, wind turbines, and by sailboat keels, ship&#x27;s rudders, and hydrofoils in water. Lift is also used by flying and gliding animals, especially by birds, bats, and insects, and even in the plant world by the seeds of certain trees.
While the common meaning of the word &quot;&quot; assumes that lift opposes weight, lift can be in any direction with respect to gravity, since it is defined with respect to the direction of flow rather than to the direction of gravity. When an aircraft is cruising in straight and level flight, the lift opposes gravity. However, when an aircraft is climbing, descending, or banking in a turn the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical. Lift may also act as downforce on the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft at the top of an aerobatic loop, and on the horizontal stabiliser of an aircraft. Lift may also be largely horizontal, for instance on a sailing ship.

The lift discussed in this article is mainly in relation to airfoils; marine hydrofoils and propellers share the same physical principles and work in the same way, despite differences between air and water such as density, compressibility, and viscosity.

The flow around a lifting airfoil is a fluid mechanics phenomenon that can be understood on essentially two levels: There are mathematical theories, which are based on established laws of physics and represent the flow accurately, but which require solving equations. And there are physical explanations without math, which are less rigorous. Correctly explaining lift in these qualitative terms is difficult because the cause-and-effect relationships involved are subtle. A comprehensive explanation that captures all of the essential aspects is necessarily complex. There are also many simplified explanations, but all leave significant parts of the phenomenon unexplained, while some also have elements that are simply incorrect.

==Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil==

An airfoil is a streamlined shape that is capable of generating significantly more lift than drag. A flat plate can generate lift, but not as much as a streamlined airfoil, and with somewhat higher drag.
Most simplified explanations follow one of two basic approaches, based either on Newton&#x27;s laws of motion or on Bernoulli&#x27;s principle.

===Explanation based on flow deflection and Newton&#x27;s laws===
An airfoil generates lift by exerting a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton&#x27;s third law, the air must exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is lift.

As the airflow approaches the airfoil it is curving upward, but as it passes the airfoil it changes direction and follows a path that is curved downward. According to Newton&#x27;s second law, this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil. Then Newton&#x27;s third law requires the air to exert an upward force on the airfoil; thus a reaction force, lift, is generated opposite to the directional change. In the case of an airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing.

The downward turning of the flow is not produced solely by the lower surface of the airfoil, and the air flow above the airfoil accounts for much of the downward-turning action.

This explanation is correct but it is incomplete. It does not explain how the airfoil can impart downward turning to a much deeper swath of the flow than it actually touches. Furthermore, it does not mention that the lift force is exerted by pressure differences, and does not explain how those pressure differences are sustained.

====Controversy regarding the Coandă effect====
Some versions of the flow-deflection explanation of lift cite the Coandă effect as the reason the flow is able to follow the convex upper surface of the airfoil. The conventional definition in the aerodynamics field is that the &quot;Coandă effect&quot; refers to the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent surface that curves away from the flow, and the resultant entrainment of ambient air into the flow.

More broadly, some consider the effect to include the tendency of any fluid boundary layer to adhere to a curved surface, not just the boundary layer accompanying a fluid jet. It is in this broader sense that the Coandă effect is used by some popular references to explain why airflow remains attached to the top side of an airfoil. This is a controversial use of the term &quot;Coandă effect&quot;; the flow following the upper surface simply reflects an absence of boundary-layer separation, thus it is not an example of the Coandă effect. Regardless of whether this broader definition of the &quot;Coandă effect&quot; is applicable, calling it the &quot;Coandă effect&quot; does not provide an explanation, it just gives the phenomenon a name.

The ability of a fluid flow to follow a curved path is not dependent on shear forces, viscosity of the fluid, or the presence of a boundary layer. Air flowing around an airfoil, adhering to both upper and lower surfaces, and generating lift, is accepted as a phenomenon in inviscid flow.

===Explanations based on an increase in flow speed and Bernoulli&#x27;s principle===

There are two common versions of this explanation, one based on &quot;equal transit time&quot;, and one based on &quot;obstruction&quot; of the airflow.

====False explanation based on equal transit-time====

The &quot;equal transit time&quot; explanation starts by arguing that the flow over the upper surface is faster than the flow over the lower surface because the path length over the upper surface is longer and must be traversed in equal transit time. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle states that under certain conditions increased flow speed is associated with reduced pressure. It is concluded that the reduced pressure over the upper surface results in upward lift.

While it is true that the flow speeds up, a serious flaw in this explanation is that it does not correctly explain what causes the flow to speed up. The longer-path-length explanation is incorrect. No difference in path length is needed, and even when there is a difference, it is typically much too small to explain the observed speed difference. This is because the assumption of equal transit time is wrong when applied to a body generating lift. There is no physical principle that requires equal transit time in all situations and experimental results confirm that for a body generating lift the transit times are not equal. In fact, the air moving past the top of an airfoil generating lift moves &quot;much&quot; &quot;faster&quot; than equal transit time predicts. The much higher flow speed over the upper surface can be clearly seen in this animated flow visualization.

====Obstruction of the airflow====
Like the equal transit time explanation, the &quot;obstruction&quot; or &quot;streamtube pinching&quot; explanation argues that the flow over the upper surface is faster than the flow over the lower surface, but gives a different reason for the difference in speed. It argues that the curved upper surface acts as more of an obstacle to the flow, forcing the streamlines to pinch closer together, making the streamtubes narrower. When streamtubes become narrower, conservation of mass requires that flow speed must increase. Reduced upper-surface pressure and upward lift follow from the higher speed by Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, just as in the equal transit time explanation. Sometimes an analogy is made to a venturi nozzle, claiming the upper surface of the wing acts like a venturi nozzle to constrict the flow.

One serious flaw in the obstruction explanation is that it does not explain how streamtube pinching comes about, or why it is greater over the upper surface than the lower surface. For conventional wings that are flat on the bottom and curved on top this makes some intuitive sense, but it does not explain how flat plates, symmetric airfoils, sailboat sails, or conventional airfoils flying upside down can generate lift, and attempts to calculate lift based on the amount of constriction or obstruction do not predict experimental results. Another flaw is that conservation of mass is not a satisfying physical reason why the flow would speed up. Effectively explaining the acceleration of an object requires identifying the force that accelerates it.

====Issues common to both versions of the Bernoulli-based explanation====
A serious flaw common to all the Bernoulli-based explanations is that they imply that a speed difference can arise from causes other than a pressure difference, and that the speed difference then leads to a pressure difference, by Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. This implied one-way causation is a misconception. The real relationship between pressure and flow speed is a mutual interaction. As explained below under a more comprehensive physical explanation, producing a lift force requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions. The Bernoulli-only explanations do not explain how the pressure differences in the vertical direction are sustained. That is, they leave out the flow-deflection part of the interaction.

Although the two simple Bernoulli-based explanations above are incorrect, there is nothing incorrect about Bernoulli&#x27;s principle or the fact that the air goes faster on the top of the wing, and Bernoulli&#x27;s principle can be used correctly as part of a more complicated explanation of lift.

==Basic attributes of lift==

Lift is a result of pressure differences and depends on angle of attack, airfoil shape, air density, and airspeed.

===Pressure differences===

Pressure is the normal force per unit area exerted by the air on itself and on surfaces that it touches. The lift force is transmitted through the pressure, which acts perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Thus, the net force manifests itself as pressure differences. The direction of the net force implies that the average pressure on the upper surface of the airfoil is lower than the average pressure on the underside.

These pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved airflow. When a fluid follows a curved path, there is a pressure gradient perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside. This direct relationship between curved streamlines and pressure differences, sometimes called the streamline curvature theorem, was derived from Newton&#x27;s second law by Leonhard Euler in 1754:

:formula_1

The left side of this equation represents the pressure difference perpendicular to the fluid flow. On the right side of the equation, ρ is the density, v is the velocity, and R is the radius of curvature. This formula shows that higher velocities and tighter curvatures create larger pressure differentials and that for straight flow (R → ∞), the pressure difference is zero.

===Angle of attack===
The angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the oncoming airflow. A symmetrical airfoil generates zero lift at zero angle of attack. But as the angle of attack increases, the air is deflected through a larger angle and the vertical component of the airstream velocity increases, resulting in more lift. For small angles, a symmetrical airfoil generates a lift force roughly proportional to the angle of attack.

As the angle of attack increases, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this critical angle of attack causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the wing; there is less deflection downward so the airfoil generates less lift. The airfoil is said to be stalled.

===Airfoil shape===
The maximum lift force that can be generated by an airfoil at a given airspeed depends on the shape of the airfoil, especially the amount of camber (curvature such that the upper surface is more convex than the lower surface, as illustrated at right). Increasing the camber generally increases the maximum lift at a given airspeed.

Cambered airfoils generate lift at zero angle of attack. When the chord line is horizontal, the trailing edge has a downward direction and since the air follows the trailing edge it is deflected downward. When a cambered airfoil is upside down, the angle of attack can be adjusted so that the lift force is upward. This explains how a plane can fly upside down.

===Flow conditions===
The ambient flow conditions which affect lift include the fluid density, viscosity and speed of flow. Density is affected by temperature, and by the medium&#x27;s acoustic velocity – i.e. by compressibility effects.

===Air speed and density===
Lift is proportional to the density of the air and approximately proportional to the square of the flow speed. Lift also depends on the size of the wing, being generally proportional to the wing&#x27;s area projected in the lift direction. In calculations it is convenient to quantify lift in terms of a lift coefficient based on these factors.

===Boundary layer and profile drag===
No matter how smooth the surface of an airfoil seems, any surface is rough on the scale of air molecules. Air molecules flying into the surface bounce off the rough surface in random directions relative to their original velocities. The result is that when the air is viewed as a continuous material, it is seen to be unable to slide along the surface, and the air&#x27;s velocity relative to the airfoil decreases to nearly zero at the surface (i.e., the air molecules &quot;stick&quot; to the surface instead of sliding along it), something known as the no-slip condition. Because the air at the surface has near-zero velocity but the air away from the surface is moving, there is a thin boundary layer in which air close to the surface is subjected to a shearing motion. The air&#x27;s viscosity resists the shearing, giving rise to a shear stress at the airfoil&#x27;s surface called skin friction drag. Over most of the surface of most airfoils, the boundary layer is naturally turbulent, which increases skin friction drag.

Under usual flight conditions, the boundary layer remains attached to both the upper and lower surfaces all the way to the trailing edge, and its effect on the rest of the flow is modest. Compared to the predictions of inviscid flow theory, in which there is no boundary layer, the attached boundary layer reduces the lift by a modest amount and modifies the pressure distribution somewhat, which results in a viscosity-related pressure drag over and above the skin friction drag. The total of the skin friction drag and the viscosity-related pressure drag is usually called the profile drag.

===Stalling===


An airfoil&#x27;s maximum lift at a given airspeed is limited by boundary-layer separation. As the angle of attack is increased, a point is reached where the boundary layer can no longer remain attached to the upper surface. When the boundary layer separates, it leaves a region of recirculating flow above the upper surface, as illustrated in the flow-visualization photo at right. This is known as the &quot;stall&quot;, or &quot;stalling&quot;. At angles of attack above the stall, lift is significantly reduced, though it does not drop to zero. The maximum lift that can be achieved before stall, in terms of the lift coefficient, is generally less than 1.5 for single-element airfoils and can be more than 3.0 for airfoils with high-lift slotted flaps and leading-edge devices deployed.

===Bluff bodies===

The flow around bluff bodies – i.e. without a streamlined shape, or stalling airfoils – may also generate lift, in addition to a strong drag force. This lift may be steady, or it may oscillate due to vortex shedding. Interaction of the object&#x27;s flexibility with the vortex shedding may enhance the effects of fluctuating lift and cause vortex-induced vibrations. For instance, the flow around a circular cylinder generates a Kármán vortex street: vortices being shed in an alternating fashion from the cylinder&#x27;s sides. The oscillatory nature of the flow produces a fluctuating lift force on the cylinder, even though the net (mean) force is negligible. The lift force frequency is characterised by the dimensionless Strouhal number, which depends on the Reynolds number of the flow.

For a flexible structure, this oscillatory lift force may induce vortex-induced vibrations. Under certain conditions – for instance resonance or strong spanwise correlation of the lift force – the resulting motion of the structure due to the lift fluctuations may be strongly enhanced. Such vibrations may pose problems and threaten collapse in tall man-made structures like industrial chimneys.

In the Magnus effect, a lift force is generated by a spinning cylinder in a freestream. Here the mechanical rotation acts on the boundary layer, causing it to separate at different locations on the two sides of the cylinder. The asymmetric separation changes the effective shape of the cylinder as far as the flow is concerned such that the cylinder acts like a lifting airfoil with circulation in the outer flow.

==A more comprehensive physical explanation==

As described above under &quot;Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil&quot;, there are two main popular explanations: one based on downward deflection of the flow (Newton&#x27;s laws), and one based on pressure differences accompanied by changes in flow speed (Bernoulli&#x27;s principle). Either of these, by itself, correctly identifies some aspects of the lifting flow but leaves other important aspects of the phenomenon unexplained. A more comprehensive explanation involves both downward deflection and pressure differences (including changes in flow speed associated with the pressure differences), and requires looking at the flow in more detail.

===Lift at the airfoil surface===

The airfoil shape and angle of attack work together so that the airfoil exerts a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton&#x27;s third law, the air must then exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is the lift.

The net force exerted by the air occurs as a pressure difference over the airfoil&#x27;s surfaces. Pressure in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense, so that pressure must always be thought of as pushing, and never as pulling. The pressure thus pushes inward on the airfoil everywhere on both the upper and lower surfaces. The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing the pressure on the wing&#x27;s upper surface and increasing the pressure on the lower surface. The pressure on the lower surface pushes up harder than the reduced pressure on the upper surface pushes down, and the net result is upward lift.

The pressure difference which results in lift acts directly on the airfoil surfaces; however, understanding how the pressure difference is produced requires understanding what the flow does over a wider area.

===The wider flow around the airfoil===
An airfoil affects the speed and direction of the flow over a wide area, producing a pattern called a &quot;velocity field&quot;. When an airfoil produces lift, the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward, the flow above and below the airfoil is deflected downward leaving the air far behind the airfoil in the same state as the oncoming flow far ahead. The flow above the upper surface is sped up, while the flow below the airfoil is slowed down. Together with the upward deflection of air in front and the downward deflection of the air immediately behind, this establishes a net circulatory component of the flow. The downward deflection and the changes in flow speed are pronounced and extend over a wide area, as can be seen in the flow animation on the right. These differences in the direction and speed of the flow are greatest close to the airfoil and decrease gradually far above and below. All of these features of the velocity field also appear in theoretical models for lifting flows.

The pressure is also affected over a wide area, in a pattern of non-uniform pressure called a &quot;pressure field&quot;. When an airfoil produces lift, there is a diffuse region of low pressure above the airfoil, and usually a diffuse region of high pressure below, as illustrated by the isobars (curves of constant pressure) in the drawing. The pressure difference that acts on the surface is just part of this pressure field.

===Mutual interaction of pressure differences and changes in flow velocity===

The non-uniform pressure exerts forces on the air in the direction from higher pressure to lower pressure. The direction of the force is different at different locations around the airfoil, as indicated by the block arrows in the &quot;pressure field around an airfoil&quot; figure. Air above the airfoil is pushed toward the center of the low-pressure region, and air below the airfoil is pushed outward from the center of the high-pressure region.

According to &quot;Newton&#x27;s second law&quot;, a force causes air to accelerate in the direction of the force. Thus the vertical arrows in the accompanying pressure field diagram indicate that air above and below the airfoil is accelerated, or turned downward, and that the non-uniform pressure is thus the cause of the downward deflection of the flow visible in the flow animation. To produce this downward turning, the airfoil must have a positive angle of attack or have sufficient positive camber. Note that the downward turning of the flow over the upper surface is the result of the air being pushed downward by higher pressure above it than below it. Some explanations that refer to the &quot;Coandă effect&quot; suggest that viscosity plays a key role in the downward turning, but this is false. (see above under &quot;Controversy regarding the Coandă effect&quot;).

The arrows ahead of the airfoil indicate that the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward, and the arrows behind the airfoil indicate that the flow behind is deflected upward again, after being deflected downward over the airfoil. These deflections are also visible in the flow animation.

The arrows ahead of the airfoil and behind also indicate that air passing through the low-pressure region above the airfoil is sped up as it enters, and slowed back down as it leaves. Air passing through the high-pressure region below the airfoil is slowed down as it enters and then sped back up as it leaves. Thus the non-uniform pressure is also the cause of the changes in flow speed visible in the flow animation. The changes in flow speed are consistent with &quot;Bernoulli&#x27;s principle&quot;, which states that in a steady flow without viscosity, lower pressure means higher speed, and higher pressure means lower speed.

Thus changes in flow direction and speed are directly caused by the non-uniform pressure. But this cause-and-effect relationship is not just one-way; it works in both directions simultaneously. The air&#x27;s motion is affected by the pressure differences, but the existence of the pressure differences depends on the air&#x27;s motion. The relationship is thus a mutual, or reciprocal, interaction: Air flow changes speed or direction in response to pressure differences, and the pressure differences are sustained by the air&#x27;s resistance to changing speed or direction. A pressure difference can exist only if something is there for it to push against. In aerodynamic flow, the pressure difference pushes against the air&#x27;s inertia, as the air is accelerated by the pressure difference. This is why the air&#x27;s mass is part of the calculation, and why lift depends on air density.

Sustaining the pressure difference that exerts the lift force on the airfoil surfaces requires sustaining a pattern of non-uniform pressure in a wide area around the airfoil. This requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions, and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed according to Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. The pressure differences and the changes in flow direction and speed sustain each other in a mutual interaction. The pressure differences follow naturally from Newton&#x27;s second law and from the fact that flow along the surface follows the predominantly downward-sloping contours of the airfoil. And the fact that the air has mass is crucial to the interaction.

===How simpler explanations fall short===

Producing a lift force requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed consistent with Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. Each of the simplified explanations given above in Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil falls short by trying to explain lift in terms of only one or the other, thus explaining only part of the phenomenon and leaving other parts unexplained.

==Quantifying lift==

===Pressure integration===
When the pressure distribution on the airfoil surface is known, determining the total lift requires adding up the contributions to the pressure force from local elements of the surface, each with its own local value of pressure. The total lift is thus the integral of the pressure, in the direction perpendicular to the farfield flow, over the airfoil surface.

: formula_2

where:
* S is the projected (planform) area of the airfoil, measured normal to the mean airflow;
* n is the normal unit vector pointing into the wing;
* k is the vertical unit vector, normal to the freestream direction.

The above lift equation neglects the skin friction forces, which are small compared to the pressure forces.

By using the streamwise vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral, we obtain an expression for the pressure drag &quot;Dp&quot; (which includes the pressure portion of the profile drag and, if the wing is three-dimensional, the induced drag). If we use the spanwise vector j, we obtain the side force &quot;Y&quot;.

:formula_3

The validity of this integration generally requires the airfoil shape to be a closed curve that is piecewise smooth.

===Lift coefficient===
Lift depends on the size of the wing, being approximately proportional to the wing area. It is often convenient to quantify the lift of a given airfoil by its &quot;lift coefficient&quot; formula_4, which defines its overall lift in terms of a unit area of the wing.

If the value of formula_4 for a wing at a specified angle of attack is given, then the lift produced for specific flow conditions can be determined:

:formula_6

where 
* formula_7 is the lift force
* formula_8 is the air density
* formula_9 is the velocity or true airspeed
* formula_10 is the planform (projected) wing area
* formula_4 is the lift coefficient at the desired angle of attack, Mach number, and Reynolds number

==Mathematical theories of lift==
Mathematical theories of lift are based on continuum fluid mechanics, assuming that air flows as a continuous fluid. Lift is generated in accordance with the fundamental principles of physics, the most relevant being the following three principles:
* Conservation of momentum, which is a consequence of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, especially Newton&#x27;s second law which relates the net force on an element of air to its rate of momentum change,
* Conservation of mass, including the assumption that the airfoil&#x27;s surface is impermeable for the air flowing around, and
* Conservation of energy, which says that energy is neither created nor destroyed.

Because an airfoil affects the flow in a wide area around it, the conservation laws of mechanics are embodied in the form of partial differential equations combined with a set of boundary condition requirements which the flow has to satisfy at the airfoil surface and far away from the airfoil.

To predict lift requires solving the equations for a particular airfoil shape and flow condition, which generally requires calculations that are so voluminous that they are practical only on a computer, through the methods of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Determining the net aerodynamic force from a CFD solution requires &quot;adding up&quot; (integrating) the forces due to pressure and shear determined by the CFD over every surface element of the airfoil as described under &quot;pressure integration&quot;.

The Navier–Stokes equations (NS) provide the potentially most accurate theory of lift, but in practice, capturing the effects of turbulence in the boundary layer on the airfoil surface requires sacrificing some accuracy, and requires use of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS). Simpler but less accurate theories have also been developed.

===Navier–Stokes (NS) equations===

These equations represent conservation of mass, Newton&#x27;s second law (conservation of momentum), conservation of energy, the Newtonian law for the action of viscosity, the Fourier heat conduction law, an equation of state relating density, temperature, and pressure, and formulas for the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid.

In principle, the NS equations, combined with boundary conditions of no through-flow and no slip at the airfoil surface, could be used to predict lift with high accuracy in any situation in ordinary atmospheric flight. However, airflows in practical situations always involve turbulence in the boundary layer next to the airfoil surface, at least over the aft portion of the airfoil. Predicting lift by solving the NS equations in their raw form would require the calculations to resolve the details of the turbulence, down to the smallest eddy. This is not yet possible, even on the most powerful computer. So in principle the NS equations provide a complete and very accurate theory of lift, but practical prediction of lift requires that the effects of turbulence be modeled in the RANS equations rather than computed directly.

===Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations===

These are the NS equations with the turbulence motions averaged over time, and the effects of the turbulence on the time-averaged flow represented by turbulence modeling (an additional set of equations based on a combination of dimensional analysis and empirical information on how turbulence affects a boundary layer in a time-averaged average sense). A RANS solution consists of the time-averaged velocity vector, pressure, density, and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil.

The amount of computation required is a minuscule fraction (billionths) of what would be required to resolve all of the turbulence motions in a raw NS calculation, and with large computers available it is now practical to carry out RANS calculations for complete airplanes in three dimensions. Because turbulence models are not perfect, the accuracy of RANS calculations is imperfect, but it is adequate for practical aircraft design. Lift predicted by RANS is usually within a few percent of the actual lift.

===Inviscid-flow equations (Euler or potential)===

The Euler equations are the NS equations without the viscosity, heat conduction, and turbulence effects. As with a RANS solution, an Euler solution consists of the velocity vector, pressure, density, and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil. While the Euler equations are simpler than the NS equations, they do not lend themselves to exact analytic solutions.

Further simplification is available through potential flow theory, which reduces the number of unknowns to be determined, and makes analytic solutions possible in some cases, as described below.

Either Euler or potential-flow calculations predict the pressure distribution on the airfoil surfaces roughly correctly for angles of attack below stall, where they might miss the total lift by as much as 10–20%. At angles of attack above stall, inviscid calculations do not predict that stall has happened, and as a result they grossly overestimate the lift.

In potential-flow theory, the flow is assumed to be irrotational, i.e. that small fluid parcels have no net rate of rotation. Mathematically, this is expressed by the statement that the curl of the velocity vector field is everywhere equal to zero. Irrotational flows have the convenient property that the velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function called a potential. A flow represented in this way is called potential flow.

In potential-flow theory, the flow is assumed to be incompressible. Incompressible potential-flow theory has the advantage that the equation (Laplace&#x27;s equation) to be solved for the potential is linear, which allows solutions to be constructed by superposition of other known solutions. The incompressible-potential-flow equation can also be solved by conformal mapping, a method based on the theory of functions of a complex variable. In the early 20th century, before computers were available, conformal mapping was used to generate solutions to the incompressible potential-flow equation for a class of idealized airfoil shapes, providing some of the first practical theoretical predictions of the pressure distribution on a lifting airfoil.

A solution of the potential equation directly determines only the velocity field. The pressure field is deduced from the velocity field through Bernoulli&#x27;s equation.

Applying potential-flow theory to a lifting flow requires special treatment and an additional assumption. The problem arises because lift on an airfoil in inviscid flow requires circulation in the flow around the airfoil (See &quot;Circulation and the Kutta–Joukowski theorem&quot; below), but a single potential function that is continuous throughout the domain around the airfoil cannot represent a flow with nonzero circulation. The solution to this problem is to introduce a branch cut, a curve or line from some point on the airfoil surface out to infinite distance, and to allow a jump in the value of the potential across the cut. The jump in the potential imposes circulation in the flow equal to the potential jump and thus allows nonzero circulation to be represented. However, the potential jump is a free parameter that is not determined by the potential equation or the other boundary conditions, and the solution is thus indeterminate. A potential-flow solution exists for any value of the circulation and any value of the lift. One way to resolve this indeterminacy is to impose the Kutta condition, which is that, of all the possible solutions, the physically reasonable solution is the one in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly. The streamline sketches illustrate one flow pattern with zero lift, in which the flow goes around the trailing edge and leaves the upper surface ahead of the trailing edge, and another flow pattern with positive lift, in which the flow leaves smoothly at the trailing edge in accordance with the Kutta condition.

===Linearized potential flow===

This is potential-flow theory with the further assumptions that the airfoil is very thin and the angle of attack is small. The linearized theory predicts the general character of the airfoil pressure distribution and how it is influenced by airfoil shape and angle of attack, but is not accurate enough for design work. For a 2D airfoil, such calculations can be done in a fraction of a second in a spreadsheet on a PC.

===Circulation and the Kutta–Joukowski theorem===
When an airfoil generates lift, several components of the overall velocity field contribute to a net circulation of air around it: the upward flow ahead of the airfoil, the accelerated flow above, the decelerated flow below, and the downward flow behind.

The circulation can be understood as the total amount of &quot;spinning&quot; (or vorticity) of an inviscid fluid around the airfoil.

The Kutta–Joukowski theorem relates the lift per unit width of span of a two-dimensional airfoil to this circulation component of the flow. It is a key element in an explanation of lift that follows the development of the flow around an airfoil as the airfoil starts its motion from rest and a starting vortex is formed and left behind, leading to the formation of circulation around the airfoil. Lift is then inferred from the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. This explanation is largely mathematical, and its general progression is based on logical inference, not physical cause-and-effect.

The Kutta–Joukowski model does not predict how much circulation or lift a two-dimensional airfoil produces. Calculating the lift per unit span using Kutta–Joukowski requires a known value for the circulation. In particular, if the Kutta condition is met, in which the rear stagnation point moves to the airfoil trailing edge and attaches there for the duration of flight, the lift can be calculated theoretically through the conformal mapping method.

The lift generated by a conventional airfoil is dictated by both its design and the flight conditions, such as forward velocity, angle of attack and air density. Lift can be increased by artificially increasing the circulation, for example by boundary-layer blowing or the use of blown flaps. In the Flettner rotor the entire airfoil is circular and spins about a spanwise axis to create the circulation.

==Three-dimensional flow==


The flow around a three-dimensional wing involves significant additional issues, especially relating to the wing tips. For a wing of low aspect ratio, such as a typical delta wing, two-dimensional theories may provide a poor model and three-dimensional flow effects can dominate. Even for wings of high aspect ratio, the three-dimensional effects associated with finite span can affect the whole span, not just close to the tips.

===Wing tips and spanwise distribution===
The vertical pressure gradient at the wing tips causes air to flow sideways, out from under the wing then up and back over the upper surface. This reduces the pressure gradient at the wing tip, therefore also reducing lift. The lift tends to decrease in the spanwise direction from root to tip, and the pressure distributions around the airfoil sections change accordingly in the spanwise direction. Pressure distributions in planes perpendicular to the flight direction tend to look like the illustration at right. This spanwise-varying pressure distribution is sustained by a mutual interaction with the velocity field. Flow below the wing is accelerated outboard, flow outboard of the tips is accelerated upward, and flow above the wing is accelerated inboard, which results in the flow pattern illustrated at right.

There is more downward turning of the flow than there would be in a two-dimensional flow with the same airfoil shape and sectional lift, and a higher sectional angle of attack is required to achieve the same lift compared to a two-dimensional flow. The wing is effectively flying in a downdraft of its own making, as if the freestream flow were tilted downward, with the result that the total aerodynamic force vector is tilted backward slightly compared to what it would be in two dimensions. The additional backward component of the force vector is called lift-induced drag.

The difference in the spanwise component of velocity above and below the wing (between being in the inboard direction above and in the outboard direction below) persists at the trailing edge and into the wake downstream. After the flow leaves the trailing edge, this difference in velocity takes place across a relatively thin shear layer called a vortex sheet.

===Horseshoe vortex system===

The wingtip flow leaving the wing creates a tip vortex. As the main vortex sheet passes downstream from the trailing edge, it rolls up at its outer edges, merging with the tip vortices. The combination of the wingtip vortices and the vortex sheets feeding them is called the vortex wake.

In addition to the vorticity in the trailing vortex wake there is vorticity in the wing&#x27;s boundary layer, called &#x27;bound vorticity&#x27;, which connects the trailing sheets from the two sides of the wing into a vortex system in the general form of a horseshoe. The horseshoe form of the vortex system was recognized by the British aeronautical pioneer Lanchester in 1907.

Given the distribution of bound vorticity and the vorticity in the wake, the Biot–Savart law (a vector-calculus relation) can be used to calculate the velocity perturbation anywhere in the field, caused by the lift on the wing. Approximate theories for the lift distribution and lift-induced drag of three-dimensional wings are based on such analysis applied to the wing&#x27;s horseshoe vortex system. In these theories, the bound vorticity is usually idealized and assumed to reside at the camber surface inside the wing.

Because the velocity is deduced from the vorticity in such theories, some authors describe the situation to imply that the vorticity is the cause of the velocity perturbations, using terms such as &quot;the velocity induced by the vortex&quot;, for example. But attributing mechanical cause-and-effect between the vorticity and the velocity in this way is not consistent with the physics. The velocity perturbations in the flow around a wing are in fact produced by the pressure field.

==Manifestations of lift in the farfield==

===Integrated force/momentum balance in lifting flows===
The flow around a lifting airfoil must satisfy Newton&#x27;s second law regarding conservation of momentum, both locally at every point in the flow field, and in an integrated sense over any extended region of the flow. For an extended region, Newton&#x27;s second law takes the form of the &quot;momentum theorem for a control volume&quot;, where a control volume can be any region of the flow chosen for analysis. The momentum theorem states that the integrated force exerted at the boundaries of the control volume (a surface integral), is equal to the integrated time rate of change (material derivative) of the momentum of fluid parcels passing through the interior of the control volume. For a steady flow, this can be expressed in the form of the net surface integral of the flux of momentum through the boundary.

The lifting flow around a 2D airfoil is usually analyzed in a control volume that completely surrounds the airfoil, so that the inner boundary of the control volume is the airfoil surface, where the downward force per unit span formula_12 is exerted on the fluid by the airfoil. The outer boundary is usually either a large circle or a large rectangle. At this outer boundary distant from the airfoil, the velocity and pressure are well represented by the velocity and pressure associated with a uniform flow plus a vortex, and viscous stress is negligible, so that the only force that must be integrated over the outer boundary is the pressure. The free-stream velocity is usually assumed to be horizontal, with lift vertically upward, so that the vertical momentum is the component of interest.

For the free-air case (no ground plane), the force formula_12 exerted by the airfoil on the fluid is manifested partly as momentum fluxes and partly as pressure differences at the outer boundary, in proportions that depend on the shape of the outer boundary, as shown in the diagram at right. For a flat horizontal rectangle that is much longer than it is tall, the fluxes of vertical momentum through the front and back are negligible, and the lift is accounted for entirely by the integrated pressure differences on the top and bottom. For a square or circle, the momentum fluxes and pressure differences account for half the lift each. For a vertical rectangle that is much taller than it is wide, the unbalanced pressure forces on the top and bottom are negligible, and lift is accounted for entirely by momentum fluxes, with a flux of upward momentum that enters the control volume through the front accounting for half the lift, and a flux of downward momentum that exits the control volume through the back accounting for the other half.

The results of all of the control-volume analyses described above are consistent with the Kutta–Joukowski theorem described above. Both the tall rectangle and circle control volumes have been used in derivations of the theorem.

===Lift reacted by overpressure on the ground under an airplane===
An airfoil produces a pressure field in the surrounding air, as explained under &quot;The wider flow around the airfoil&quot; above. The pressure differences associated with this field die off gradually, becoming very small at large distances, but never disappearing altogether. Below the airplane, the pressure field persists as a positive pressure disturbance that reaches the ground, forming a pattern of slightly-higher-than-ambient pressure on the ground, as shown on the right. Although the pressure differences are very small far below the airplane, they are spread over a wide area and add up to a substantial force. For steady, level flight, the integrated force due to the pressure differences is equal to the total aerodynamic lift of the airplane and to the airplane&#x27;s weight. According to Newton&#x27;s third law, this pressure force exerted on the ground by the air is matched by an equal-and-opposite upward force exerted on the air by the ground, which offsets all of the downward force exerted on the air by the airplane. The net force due to the lift, acting on the atmosphere as a whole, is therefore zero, and thus there is no integrated accumulation of vertical momentum in the atmosphere, as was noted by Lanchester early in the development of modern aerodynamics.

<text>Leo III the Isaurian (; 685 – 18 June 741), also known as the Syrian, was the first Byzantine emperor of the Isaurian dynasty from 717 until his death in 741. He put an end to the Twenty Years&#x27; Anarchy, a period of great instability in the Byzantine Empire between 695 and 717, marked by the rapid succession of several emperors to the throne, along with ending the continual defeats and territorial losses the Byzantines had suffered during the 7th century. He also successfully defended the Empire against the invading Umayyads and forbade the veneration of icons.

== Early life ==
Leo III was born in Germanikeia, Commagene, which is in modern Kahramanmaraş in Turkey. His original name was Konon (). Leo III was fluent in Arabic, possibly as a native language, and was described by Theophanes the Confessor as &quot;the Saracen-minded,&quot; although there is very little evidence that he was directly influenced by Islam.

After the victory of Justinian II, Konon was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to Alania and Lazica to organize an alliance against the Umayyad caliphate under al-Walid I. According to the chronicle written by Theophanes the Confessor, Justinian wanted to get rid of Konon and took back the money that had been given to him to help advance Byzantine interests, thus leaving Konon stranded in Alania. The chronicle describes the mission as successful and Konon returning eventually to Justinian after crossing the Caucasus mountains in May with snowshoes and taking the fortress of Sideron, associated with the Tsebelda fortress, on the way.

Konon was appointed commander (&quot;stratēgos&quot;) of the Anatolic Theme by Emperor Anastasius II. On his deposition, Konon joined with his colleague Artabasdos, the &quot;stratēgos&quot; of the Armeniac Theme, in conspiring to overthrow the new Emperor Theodosius III, ostensibly in support of Anastasius. Artabasdos was betrothed to Konon&#x27;s daughter Anna. In 717, Konon marched on Constantinople, capturing Theodosius&#x27; son at Nicomedia. He forced Theodosius to abdicate, promising safety for him and his family. Theodosius then became a monk at Ephesus. On 25 March, abandoning his allegiance to Anastasius, Konon was crowned by Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople as Emperor Leo III at the Hagia Sophia.

== Siege of Constantinople ==
The new emperor was immediately forced to attend to the second Arab siege of Constantinople, which commenced in August of the same year. The Arabs were Umayyad forces sent by Caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik and serving under his brother Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik. They had taken advantage of the civil discord in the Byzantine Empire to bring a force of 80,000 to 150,000 men and a massive fleet to the Bosphorus, intending to seize the Byzantine capital and destroy the Empire with a single overwhelming attack.

Careful preparations, begun three years earlier under Anastasius II, and the stubborn resistance put up by Leo wore out the invaders. An important factor in the victory of the Byzantines was their use of Greek fire. The Arab forces also fell victim to Bulgarian reinforcements arriving to aid the Byzantines. Leo was allied with the Bulgarians but the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor was uncertain if they were still serving under Tervel of Bulgaria or his eventual successor Kormesiy of Bulgaria.

Faced with the Bulgarian onslaught, the impenetrability of Constantinople&#x27;s walls, and their own exhausted provisions, the Arabs were forced to abandon the siege in August 718. Sulayman had died the previous year, and his successor Umar II never made a second attempt to capture the city. The siege had lasted 12 months.

== Reign ==
Having thus saved the Empire from extinction, Leo proceeded to consolidate its administration, which in the previous years of anarchy had become completely disorganized. In 718 he suppressed a rebellion in Sicily. The following year saw the deposed Emperor Anastasius II raise an army and attempt to retake the throne, but he was captured and executed by Leo&#x27;s government. The rebellion was the only serious threat to Leo&#x27;s usurpation. Umayyad attacks under Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik continued in the form of yearly raids in eastern and central Asia Minor (see hatched area in figure), which affected communications, commerce and agricultural production. In 721, the city of Dalisandus was captured, followed by the fortresses of Kamachon and Ikonion in 723/724 and several frontier fortresses in 725. Caesarea (Cappadocia) was captured in 727, then Gangra in 728. The Byzantine counter-raids were generally of little strategic impact, although crucially a major invading force was destroyed in the Battle of Akroinon of 740. It was only during the Third Fitna of 744–747, a civil war within the Umayyad Caliphate, that the regularity of attacks were temporarily interrupted.

Leo secured the Empire&#x27;s frontiers by inviting Slavic settlers into the depopulated districts and by restoring the army to efficiency. His military efforts were supplemented by his alliances with the Khazars and the Georgians. However, the Lombards exploited the Empire&#x27;s difficulties beginning in 717, when the duke of Benevento captured Cumae, the duke of Spoleto captured Narni and Liutprand, King of the Lombards, occupied Classe in the Exarchate of Ravenna. Although Narni was never regained, Gregory II recovered Cumae and Liutprand withdrew from Classe. In 724 or 725, Leo increased taxes in Italy which Gregory opposed. This led to two plots to assassinate Gregory, the second of which was supported by Exarch Paul, but both were foiled by the Romans with the help of the Lombards of Benevento and Spoleto.

Leo effected many political and ecclesiastical restructurings in order to bolster the authority of the Empire and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Since the end of the seventh century, imperial &quot;stratēgoi&quot; were sent to the theme of Sicily (which included Calabria), and in 732–733 Leo deprived the church of Rome of the patrimony of St Peter in the theme, reallocating tax income that originally went to the church of Rome to the imperial administration (a large annual sum of 350 pounds of gold). However in 743, Constantine V compensated Pope Zachary for this loss by granting him the estates of Ninfa and Norma to the south of Rome. Between 732 and 754, the bishops of Illyricum, Crete, Sicily, Calabria and Naples (until 769) were transferred from the authority of Rome to Constantinople. The Isaurians in general saw the church and its patriarchs as subordinate to the imperial will.

The 740 Constantinople earthquake damaged the Walls of Constantinople, the restoration of which Leo paid for out of the imperial treasury, raising the City taxes by 81⁄3 per cent in order to do so, as was recorded on the land walls near the Sea of Marmara. The Empire of the eighth century was characterized by ruralization and depopulation, which along with the Arab invasions motivated Leo to undertake intense centralization and militarization, particularly involving the many fortresses and walls in towns such as Nicaea and Padyandus.

Leo III died of dropsy on 18 June 741 and was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles.

=== Iconoclastic policies ===

Leo&#x27;s most striking legislative reforms dealt with religious matters, especially iconoclasm (&quot;icon-breaking,&quot; therefore an iconoclast is an &quot;icon-breaker&quot;). After an apparently successful attempt to enforce the baptism of all Jews and Montanists in the empire (722), he issued a series of edicts against the veneration of images (726–729).

A revolt broke out in Greece under the leadership of Agallianos Kontoskeles, mainly on religious grounds, with a certain Kosmas being declared rival emperor. The imperial fleet quashed the uprising in 727 by way of Greek fire. In 730, Patriarch Germanus opted to resign rather than subscribe to iconoclasm; Leo replaced him with Anastasius, who willingly sided with the Emperor on the question of icons. Patriarch John V of Jerusalem along with John of Damascus fiercely opposed imperial iconoclasm, issuing a pamphlet entitled &quot;Adversus Constantinum Caballinum&quot;. A later polemical version of the pamphlet attributes to Leo the saying, &quot;I am emperor and priest.&quot;

In the Italian Peninsula, the defiant attitude of Popes Gregory II and later Gregory III on behalf of image-veneration led to a fierce quarrel with the Emperor, with the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; stating that Gregory II &quot;took up arms against the emperor as if against an enemy.&quot; In Rome, the population was more sympathetic to iconodulia, killing a pro-imperial duke and blinding another, while in Naples, iconoclasm was broadly well-received. A conflict between pro- and anti-imperial factions in the Exarchate of Ravenna led to the death of Exarch Paul. The struggle was accompanied by an armed outbreak in the Exarchate in 727, which Leo endeavoured to subdue by means of a large fleet. The new Exarch, Eutychius, disembarked in Naples but could not enter Rome and assert his authority. This led to an unexpected alliance between Liutprand and Eutychius against Gregory, who, however, managed to convince the King, appealing to his piety, to return north and the Exarch to put down a revolt in Etruria led by the usurper Tiberius Petasius. In response to the promulgation of stronger iconoclastic decrees in 730, Gregory II and Gregory III summoned councils in Rome to anathematize and excommunicate the iconoclasts (730, 732). Leo retaliated by making the aforementioned transferals in Southern Italy and Illyricum from the papal diocese to that of the Patriarch of Constantinople.

====Analysis of Leo&#x27;s iconoclasm====
Scholars offer various explanations for the ban on venerating icons . On the basis of Patriarch Germanus&#x27; letters read at the 787 Second Council of Nicaea, which state that the bishops Constantine of Nakoleia and Thomas of Claudiopolis had forbidden the veneration of icons even before 730, some scholars argue that the alleged aniconism of the eastern part of the Empire, Leo&#x27;s place of origin, motivated his policies. The phrase &quot;I am emperor and priest&quot; attributed to Leo by later iconodule polemicists represents the characteristically Isaurian imperial ascendancy over the church, which was rejected in the mid-9th century after Patriarch Methodios I of Constantinople purged the clergy of iconoclasts, asserting the autonomy of the church against the iconoclast emperor, Theophilos (). Others have discussed the mutual influence of Muslim and Byzantine iconoclasm, noting that Caliph Yazid II had issued an iconoclastic edict, also targeting his Christian subjects, already in 721.

According to historian Marie-France Auzépy, these explanations are insufficient. She appeals to an explanation by Byzantine chroniclers, that a terrifying volcanic eruption at Thira in 726 was interpreted by Leo as a manifestation of God&#x27;s wrath. In the Bible, God allows his people to fall to Babylonian captivity because of their idolatry. Thus, Auzépy says, the banning of the veneration of images was fundamentally a rejection of idolatry in order to ensure the survival of the Christian people of the Empire, a decision which was apparently vindicated by the abatement of the Arab and Bulgar threat during Leo&#x27;s reign.

Some scholars, such as Leslie Brubaker and John Haldon, doubt whether there was any active imperial involvement in iconoclasm at all, proposing instead that Leo made a qualified critique of the use of images in public spaces, likely leading to the adoption of a somewhat iconoclastic attitude among the clergy in the late 730s or early 740s. The notion that there was mass imperial persecution and destruction of images is dismissed as a later &quot;iconophile myth&quot;. Brubaker and Haldon support this hypothesis by pointing to the absence of any reports of iconoclasm in several contemporary accounts, including those of Willibald, who travelled to Nicaea from 727 to 729, Germanus and even John of Damascus. The Venerable Bede does refer to a critique of images in Constantinople, and Germanus and John of Damascus say that the clergy was divided on the issue of iconoclasm, however there was no evidence of widespread support for the iconoclastic policies or of systematic removal of images under Leo. Brubaker and Haldon attribute a more moderate iconoclasm to Leo, &quot;It is quite possible that Leo did attempt to restrict the public display of certain types of image and to remove them from certain places in churches (near the altar and in the apse, for example) to avoid their receiving the honour due to God alone&quot;, confirming this conclusion with the writings of Germanus and John of Damascus which appear to describe a kind of initial or moderate stage of iconoclasm.

=== Legislation ===

Leo reformed the &quot;silention&quot;, a type of restricted council instituted by Justinian I, transforming it into a special assembly in the Great Palace of Constantinople, in which the emperor would announce a solemn decision.

Leo undertook a set of civil reforms including the abolition of the system of prepaying taxes which had weighed heavily upon the wealthier proprietors, the elevation of the serfs into a class of free tenants and the remodelling of family law, maritime law and criminal law, notably substituting mutilation for the death penalty in many cases. These punishments were contrary to the Roman legal tradition, and bear the influence of canon law. The new measures, which were embodied in a new code called the &quot;Ecloga&quot; (&quot;Selection&quot;), published in 741, met with some opposition on the part of the nobles and higher clergy. The &quot;Ecloga&quot; were a revision and abridgement of the sixth-century Code of Justinian. Leo&#x27;s prologue to the &quot;Ecloga&quot; sets out his conception of law as requiring ethical significance founded upon God&#x27;s will and divinely-sanctioned imperial authority. The authors of the legal codes of Basil I () and Leo VI the Wise () of the Macedonian dynasty formally rejected the &quot;Ecloga&quot;.

Leo and his successor Constantine V transformed the Byzantine &quot;orphanotrophos&quot; into a magistrate. Prior to these legislative reforms, Byzantine law required that all orphans are passed into the Byzantine orphanage or to a monastery.

===Numismatics===
The coins minted during Leo&#x27;s reign exclusively depicted male imperial dynasts, promoting the dynastic order of succession. In 721, Leo introduced the &quot;miliarēsion&quot;, a silver coin worth one-twelfth of a &quot;nomisma&quot;. The gold coins of Leo IV the Khazar show posthumous portraits of Leo III.

==Assessment and legacy==
In response to the catastrophic Twenty Years&#x27; Anarchy, Leo, and his son Constantine V in emulation, fundamentally changed the formula of imperial survival as established by Justinian I. The military was closely associated with the regime in order to stifle the possibility of usurpation. Imperial power was also strengthened by the introduction of low-denomination silver coins, allowing greater flexibility in raising taxes. This autocratic renewal of imperial authority was motivated by justice and spiritual welfare, leading to the denunciation and eventual destruction of images deemed to be &quot;idolatrous&quot;. These aspects, which all originate in the personality of Leo, can be attributed to the entire Isaurian dynasty, which was unwaveringly iconoclastic, Irene of Athens excepted. Succeeding generations of the Byzantine ruling class regarded the Isaurian period as one of religious persecution. The phrase &quot;I am emperor and priest&quot; attributed to Leo by later iconodule polemicists represents the characteristically Isaurian imperial ascendancy over the church, which was rejected in the mid-9th century after Patriarch Methodios I of Constantinople purged the clergy of iconoclasts, asserting the autonomy of the church against the iconoclast emperor, Theophilos ().

The few primary sources of the eighth and ninth centuries were mostly written by clerical or monastic iconodules who were hostile to Leo and Constantine V. They tended to view the period as dominated by ecclesiastical matters and in particular the imperial persecution of iconodules, despite the Empire&#x27;s contemporaneous existential struggle against its enemies. Modern assessment of the reign of Leo as well as that of his son is that it was a period of violence which saw the Empire&#x27;s rescue from destruction, within a context of extensive domestic policy reform. Leo&#x27;s successful ruse against Caliph Sulayman and his general Maslama, which secured his place on the throne, and then his successful defense of the Empire during the siege of Constantinople, earned him a reputation as a wily and formidable commander against colossal odds. His personal knowledge of the geography of the foothills of the Taurus Mountains helped in the countering of Arab incursions mainly in the latter part of his reign, as was especially signified in the Battle of Akroinon—a crucial victory for Leo which had changed the tide of the Arab–Byzantine wars in the favour of Rome for the next 350 years. However, the Byzantine control over its Italian possessions was steadily weakened during Leo&#x27;s reign, and his attempts to reassert imperial authority there failed.

In 1573, a translation of John of Damascus&#x27; attack on Leo III was published, under the title &quot;Apologie divisée en trois livres contre Léon Isaure&quot;, triggering religious controversy.

==Family==
With his wife Maria, Leo III had four known children:

* Constantine V, born in 718. He was crowned co-emperor in 720 and became senior emperor in 741. 
* Anna, born before 705. She married the future emperor Artabasdos.
*Kosmo and Irene. They were both buried in a sarcophagus of Proconnesian marble in the Church of the Apostles.

<text>The Lombards () or Longobards () were a Germanic people who conquered most of the Italian Peninsula between 568 and 774.

The medieval Lombard historian Paul the Deacon wrote in the &quot;History of the Lombards&quot; (written between 787 and 796) that the Lombards descended from a small tribe called the Winnili, who dwelt in northern Germany before migrating to seek new lands. Earlier Roman-era historians wrote of the Lombards in the first century AD as being one of the Suebian peoples, also from what is now northern Germany, near the Elbe river. They migrated south, and by the end of the fifth century, the Lombards had moved into the area roughly coinciding with modern Austria and Slovakia north of the Danube. Here they subdued the Heruls and later fought frequent wars with the Gepids. The Lombard king Audoin defeated the Gepid leader Thurisind in 551 or 552, and Audoin&#x27;s successor Alboin eventually destroyed the Gepids in 567. The Lombards also settled in Pannonia (modern-day Hungary). Near Szólád, archaeologists have unearthed burial sites of Lombard men and women buried together as families, unusual among Germanic peoples at the time. Contemporary traces have also been discovered of Mediterranean Greeks and a possible migrant from France.

Following Alboin&#x27;s victory over the Gepids, he led his people into northeastern Italy, which had become severely depopulated and devastated after the long Gothic War (535–554) between the Byzantine Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom. The Lombards were joined by numerous Saxons, Heruls, Gepids, Bulgars, Thuringians and Ostrogoths, and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed. By late 569, they had conquered all of northern Italy and the principal cities north of the Po River except Pavia, which fell in 572. At the same time, they occupied areas in central and southern Italy. They established a Lombard Kingdom in north and central Italy, which reached its zenith under the eighth-century ruler Liutprand. In 774, the kingdom was conquered by the Frankish king Charlemagne and integrated into the Frankish Empire. However, Lombard nobles continued to rule southern parts of the Italian peninsula well into the eleventh century, when they were conquered by the Normans and added to the County of Sicily. In this period, the southern part of Italy still under Lombard domination was known to the Norse as Langbarðaland (&#x27;land of the Lombards&#x27;), as inscribed in the Norse runestones. Their legacy is also apparent in the name of the region of Lombardy in northern Italy.

==Name==
According to their traditions, the Lombards initially called themselves the &quot;Winnili&quot;. After a reported major victory against the Vandals in the first century, they changed their name to &quot;Lombards&quot;. The name &quot;Winnili&quot; is generally translated as &#x27;the wolves&#x27;, related to the Proto-Germanic root &quot;*wulfaz&quot; &#x27;wolf&#x27;.&quot;&quot; The name &quot;Lombard&quot; was reportedly derived from the distinctively long beards of the Lombards. It is probably a compound of the Proto-Germanic elements *&quot;langaz&quot; (long) and *&quot;bardaz&quot; (beard).

==History==
===Early history===
====Legendary origins====

According to their own legends, the Lombards originated in Northern Germany/Denmark zone including modern-day Denmark. The Germanic origins of the Lombards is supported by genetic, anthropological, archaeological and earlier literary evidence.

A legendary account of Lombard origins, history, and practices is the &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; (&quot;History of the Lombards&quot;) of Paul the Deacon, written in the eighth century. Paul&#x27;s chief source for Lombard origins, however, is the seventh-century &quot;Origo Gentis Langobardorum&quot; (&quot;Origin of the Lombard People&quot;).

The &quot;Origo Gentis Langobardorum&quot; tells the story of a small tribe called the &quot;Winnili&quot; dwelling in Northern Germany/Denmark zone (the &quot;Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani&quot; writes that the Winnili first dwelt near a river called &quot;Vindilicus&quot; on the extreme boundary of Gaul). The Winnili were split into three groups and one part left their native land to seek foreign fields. The reason for the exodus was probably overpopulation. The departing people were led by Gambara and her sons Ybor and Aio and arrived in the lands of &quot;Scoringa&quot;, perhaps the Baltic coast or the Bardengau on the banks of the Elbe. Scoringa was ruled by the Vandals and their chieftains, the brothers Ambri and Assi, who granted the Winnili a choice between tribute or war.

The Winnili were young and brave and refused to pay tribute, saying &quot;It is better to maintain liberty by arms than to stain it by the payment of tribute.&quot; The Vandals prepared for war and consulted Godan (the god Odin), who answered that he would give victory to those whom he would see first at sunrise. The Winnili were fewer in number and Gambara sought help from Frea (the goddess Frigg), who advised that all Winnili women should tie their hair in front of their faces like beards and march in line with their husbands. At sunrise, Frea turned her husband&#x27;s bed so that he was facing east, and woke him. So Godan spotted the Winnili first and asked, &quot;Who are these long-beards?,&quot; and Frea replied, &quot;My lord, thou hast given them the name, now give them also the victory.&quot; From that moment onwards, the Winnili were known as the &quot;Longbeards&quot; (Latinised as &quot;Langobardi&quot;, Italianised as &quot;Longobardi&quot;, and Anglicized as &quot;Langobards&quot; or &quot;Lombards&quot;).

When Paul the Deacon wrote the &quot;Historia&quot; between 787 and 796 he was a Catholic monk and devoted Christian. He thought the pagan stories of his people &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;laughable&quot;. Paul explained that the name &quot;Langobard&quot; came from the length of their beards. A modern theory suggests that the name &quot;Langobard&quot; comes from &quot;Langbarðr&quot;, a name of Odin. Priester states that when the Winnili changed their name to &quot;Lombards&quot;, they also changed their old agricultural fertility cult to a cult of Odin, thus creating a conscious tribal tradition. Fröhlich inverts the order of events in Priester and states that with the Odin cult, the Lombards grew their beards in resemblance of the Odin of tradition and their new name reflected this. Bruckner remarks that the name of the Lombards stands in close relation to the worship of Odin, whose many names include &quot;the Long-bearded&quot; or &quot;the Grey-bearded&quot;, and that the Lombard given name &quot;Ansegranus&quot; (&quot;he with the beard of the gods&quot;) shows that the Lombards had this idea of their chief deity. The same Old Norse root Barth or Barði, meaning &quot;beard&quot;, is shared with the Heaðobards mentioned in both &quot;Beowulf&quot; and in &quot;Widsith&quot;, where they conflict with the Danes. They were possibly a branch of the Langobards.

Alternatively, some etymological sources suggest an Old High German root, barta, meaning &quot;axe&quot; (and related to English halberd), while Edward Gibbon puts forth an alternative suggestion which argues that:

...Börde (or Börd) still signifies &quot;a fertile plain by the side of a river,&quot; and a district near Magdeburg is still called the lange Börde. According to this view Langobardi would signify &quot;inhabitants of the long bord of the river;&quot; and traces of their name are supposed still to occur in such names as Bardengau and Bardewick in the neighborhood of the Elbe.

According to the Gallaecian Christian priest, historian and theologian Paulus Orosius (translated by Daines Barrington), the Lombards or Winnili lived originally in the Vinuiloth (Vinovilith) mentioned by Jordanes, in his masterpiece Getica, to the north of Uppsala, Sweden. Scoringa was near the province of Uppland, so just north of Östergötland.

The footnote then explains the etymology of the name Scoringa:

The shores of Uppland and Östergötland are covered with small rocks and rocky islands, which are called in German Schæren and in Swedish Skiaeren. Heal signifies a port in the northern languages; consequently, Skiæren-Heal is the port of the Skiæren, a name well adapted to the port of Stockholm, in the Upplandske Skiæren, and the country may be justly called Scorung or Skiærunga.

The legendary king Sceafa of Scandza was an ancient Lombardic king in Anglo-Saxon legend. The Old English poem Widsith, in a listing of famous kings and their countries, has Sceafa [weold] Longbeardum, so naming Sceafa as ruler of the Lombards.

Similarities between Langobardic and Gothic migration traditions have been noted among scholars. These early migration legends suggest that a major shifting of tribes occurred sometime between the first and second century BC, which would coincide with the time that the Teutoni and Cimbri left their homelands in Northern Germany and migrated through central Germany, eventually invading Roman Italy.

====Archaeology and classical sources====

The first mention of the Lombards occurred between AD 9 and 16, by the Roman court historian Velleius Paterculus, who accompanied a Roman expedition as prefect of the cavalry. Paterculus says that under Tiberius the &quot;power of the Langobardi was broken, a race surpassing even the Germans in savagery&quot;.

From the combined testimony of Strabo (AD 20) and Tacitus (AD 117), the Lombards dwelt near the mouth of the Elbe shortly after the beginning of the Christian era, next to the Chauci. Strabo states that the Lombards dwelt on both sides of the Elbe. He treats them as a branch of the Suebi, and states that:

Now as for the tribe of the Suebi, it is the largest, for it extends from the Rhenus to the Albis; and a part of them even dwells on the far side of the Albis, as, for instance, the Hermondori and the Langobardi; and at the present time these latter, at least, have, to the last man, been driven in flight out of their country into the land on the far side of the river.

Consistent with this, Suetonius wrote that Roman general Nero Claudius Drusus defeated a large force of Germans and drove some &quot;to the farther side of the Albis (Elbe)&quot; river.

The German archaeologist Willi Wegewitz defined several Iron Age burial sites at the Lower Elbe as &quot;Langobardic&quot;. The burial sites are crematorial and are usually dated from the sixth century BC through the third century AD, so a settlement breakoff seems unlikely. The lands of the lower Elbe fall into the zone of the Jastorf Culture and became Elbe-Germanic, differing from the lands between Rhine, Weser, and the North Sea. Archaeological finds show that the Lombards were an agricultural people.

Tacitus also counted the Lombards as a remote and aggressive Suebian tribe, listing them between the Semnones on the Elbe, and the Nerthus-worshipping tribes whose land of rivers and forest stretched to the sea. Writing in the late first century AD, he described the Langobardi in his &quot;Germania&quot; saying that &quot;their scanty numbers are a distinction&quot; because &quot;surrounded by a host of most powerful tribes, they are safe, not by submitting, but by daring the perils of war&quot;.

Tacitus also noted that the Lombards were subjects of Marobod the King of the Marcomanni, who was allied with Rome when Arminius and his allies won the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. However, after the outbreak of war between Arminius and Marobod in 17 AD the Lombards and Semnones switched to the alliance of Arminius. They detested Marobod&#x27;s title of king, and saw Arminius as a champion of freedom.

In 47, a struggle ensued amongst the Cherusci and they expelled their new leader, the nephew of Arminius, from their country. The Lombards appeared on the scene with sufficient power to control the destiny of the tribe that had been the leader in the struggle for independence thirty-eight years earlier, for they restored the deposed leader to sovereignty.

To the south, in 166 Cassius Dio reported that just before the Marcomannic Wars, 6,000 Lombards and Obii (sometimes thought to be Ubii) crossed the Danube and invaded Pannonia. The two tribes were defeated, whereupon they ceased their invasion and sent Ballomar, King of the Marcomanni, as ambassador to Aelius Bassus, who was then administering Pannonia. Peace was made and the two tribes returned to their homes, which in the case of the Lombards was the lands of the lower Elbe.

In the mid-second century, the Lombards supposedly appeared in the Rhineland, because according to Claudius Ptolemy, the Suebic Lombards lived &quot;below&quot; the Bructeri and Sugambri, and between these and the Tencteri. To their east stretching northwards to the central Elbe are the Suebi Angili. But Ptolemy also mentions the &quot;Laccobardi&quot; to the north of the above-mentioned Suebic territories, east of the Angrivarii on the Weser, and south of the Chauci on the coast, probably indicating a Lombard expansion from the Elbe to the Rhine. This double mention has been interpreted as an editorial error by Gudmund Schütte, in his analysis of Ptolemy. However, the &quot;Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani&quot; also mentions &quot;Patespruna&quot; (Paderborn) in connection with the Lombards.

From the second century onwards, many of the Germanic tribes recorded as active during the Principate started to unite into bigger tribal unions, such as the Franks, Alamanni, Bavarii, and Saxons. The Lombards are not mentioned at first, perhaps because they were not initially on the border of Rome, or perhaps because they were subjected to a larger tribal union, like the Saxons. It is, however, highly probable that, when the bulk of the Lombards migrated, a considerable part remained behind and afterwards became absorbed by the Saxon tribes in the Elbe region, while the emigrants alone retained the name of Lombards. However, the &quot;Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani&quot; states that the Lombards were subjected by the Saxons around 300 but rose up against them under their first king, Agelmund, who ruled for 30 years. In the second half of the fourth century, the Lombards left their homes, probably due to bad harvests, and embarked on their migration.

The migration route of the Lombards in 489, from their homeland to &quot;Rugiland&quot;, encompassed several places: &quot;Scoringa&quot; (believed to be their land on the Elbe shores), &quot;Mauringa&quot;, &quot;Golanda&quot;, &quot;Anthaib&quot;, &quot;Banthaib&quot;, and &quot;Vurgundaib&quot; (&quot;Burgundaib&quot;). According to the Ravenna Cosmography, Mauringa was the land east of the Elbe.

The crossing into Mauringa was very difficult. The Assipitti (possibly the Usipetes) denied them passage through their lands and a fight was arranged for the strongest man of each tribe. The Lombard was victorious, passage was granted, and the Lombards reached Mauringa.

The Lombards departed from Mauringa and reached Golanda. Scholar Ludwig Schmidt thinks this was further east, perhaps on the right bank of the Oder. Schmidt considers the name the equivalent of Gotland, meaning simply &quot;good land&quot;. This theory is highly plausible; Paul the Deacon mentions the Lombards crossing a river, and they could have reached &quot;Rugiland&quot; from the Upper Oder area via the Moravian Gate.

Moving out of Golanda, the Lombards passed through Anthaib and Banthaib until they reached Vurgundaib, believed to be the old lands of the Burgundes. In Vurgundaib, the Lombards were stormed in camp by &quot;Bulgars&quot; (probably Huns) and were defeated; King Agelmund was killed and Laimicho was made king. He was in his youth and desired to avenge the slaughter of Agelmund. The Lombards themselves were probably made subjects of the Huns after the defeat but rose up and defeated them with great slaughter, gaining great booty and confidence as they &quot;became bolder in undertaking the toils of war.&quot; During the reign of King Claffo, the Langobards occupied parts of modern-day Upper and Lower Austria and converted to Arian Christianity. In 505 the Herulians attacked and defeated them, obliging them to pay tax and withdraw to Northern Bohemia. In 508, King Rodulf sent his brother to the Lombard court to collect tribute and extend the truce; however, he was stabbed by Rometrud, sister of King Tato. Rodulf personally led his forces against Tato, but was ambushed and killed from a hill.

In the 540s, Audoin (ruled 546–560) led the Lombards across the Danube once more into Pannonia. Thurisind, King of the Gepids attempted to expel them, and both peoples asked for help from the Byzantines. Justinian I sent his army against the Gepids; however, it was routed on the way by the Herulians and the sides signed a two-year truce. Revenging what he felt as a betrayal, Thurisind made an alliance with the Kutrigurs who devastated Moesia before end of the armistice. The Langobard and Roman army joined together and defeated the Gepids in 551. In the battle, Audoin&#x27;s son, Alboin killed Thurisind&#x27;s son, Turismod.

In 552, the Byzantines, aided by a large contingent of Foederati, notably Lombards, Heruls and Bulgars, defeated the last Ostrogoths led by Teia in the Battle of Taginae.

===Kingdom of the Lombards, 568–774===
====Invasion and conquest of the Italian peninsula====
In approximately 560, Audoin was succeeded by his son Alboin, a young and energetic leader who defeated the neighboring Gepidae and made them his subjects; in 566, he married Rosamund, daughter of the Gepid king Cunimund. In the same year, he made a pact with Khagan Bayan. Next year the Lombards and the Avars destroyed the Gepid kingdom in the Lombard–Gepid War, the allies halved the prize of war and the nomads settled in Transylvania. In the spring of 568, Alboin, now fearing the aggressive Avars, led the Lombard migration into Italy, which he planned for years. According to the &quot;History of the Lombards,&quot; &quot;Then the Langobards, having left Pannonia, hastened to take possession of Italy with their wives and children and all their goods.&quot; The Avars have agreed to shelter them if they wish to come back.

Various other peoples who either voluntarily joined or were subjects of King Alboin were also part of the migration. Whence, even until today, we call the villages in which they dwell Gepidan, Bulgarian, Sarmatian, Pannonian, Suabian, Norican, or by other names of this kind.&quot; At least 20,000 Saxon warriors, old allies of the Lombards, and their families joined them in their new migration.

The first important city to fall was &quot;Forum Iulii&quot; (Cividale del Friuli) in northeastern Italy, in 569. There, Alboin created the first Lombard duchy, which he entrusted to his nephew Gisulf. Soon Vicenza, Verona and Brescia fell into Germanic hands. In the summer of 569, the Lombards conquered the main Roman centre of northern Italy, Milan. The area was then recovering from the terrible Gothic Wars, and the small Byzantine army left for its defence could do almost nothing. Longinus, the Exarch sent to Italy by Emperor Justin II, could only defend coastal cities that could be supplied by the powerful Byzantine fleet. Pavia fell after a siege of three years, in 572, becoming the first capital city of the new Lombard kingdom of Italy.In the following years, the Lombards penetrated further south, conquering Tuscany and establishing two duchies, Spoleto and Benevento under Zotto, which soon became semi-independent and even outlasted the northern kingdom, surviving well into the twelfth century. Wherever they went, they were joined by the Ostrogothic population, which was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. The Byzantines managed to retain control of the area of Ravenna and Rome, linked by a thin corridor running through Perugia.

When they entered Italy, some Lombards retained their native form of paganism, while some were Arian Christians. Hence they did not enjoy good relations with the Early Christian Church. Gradually, they adopted Roman or Romanized titles, names, and traditions, and partially converted to orthodoxy (in the seventh century), though not without a long series of religious and ethnic conflicts. By the time Paul the Deacon was writing, the Lombard language, dress and even hairstyles had nearly all disappeared &quot;in toto&quot;.
The whole Lombard territory was divided into 36 duchies, whose leaders settled in the main cities. The king ruled over them and administered the land through emissaries called &quot;gastaldi&quot;. This subdivision, however, together with the independent indocility of the duchies, deprived the kingdom of unity, making it weak even when compared to the Byzantines, especially since these had begun to recover from the initial invasion. This weakness became even more evident when the Lombards had to face the increasing power of the Franks. In response, the kings tried to centralize power over time, but they definitively lost control over Spoleto and Benevento in the attempt.

====Arian monarchy====
In 572, Alboin was murdered in Verona in a plot led by his wife, Rosamund, who later fled to Ravenna. His successor, Cleph, was also assassinated, after a ruthless reign of 18 months. His death began an interregnum of years (the &quot;Rule of the Dukes&quot;) during which the dukes did not elect any king, a period regarded as a time of violence and disorder. In 586, threatened by a Frankish invasion, the dukes elected Cleph&#x27;s son, Authari, as king. In 589, he married Theodelinda, daughter of Garibald I of Bavaria, the Duke of Bavaria. The Catholic Theodelinda was a friend of Pope Gregory I and pushed for Christianization. In the meantime, Authari embarked on a policy of internal reconciliation and tried to reorganize royal administration. The dukes yielded half their estates for the maintenance of the king and his court in Pavia. On the foreign affairs side, Authari managed to thwart the dangerous alliance between the Byzantines and the Franks.

Authari died in 591 and was succeeded by Agilulf, the duke of Turin, who also married Theodelinda in the same year. Agilulf successfully fought the rebel dukes of northern Italy, conquering Padua in 601, Cremona and Mantua in 603, and forcing the Exarch of Ravenna to pay tribute. Agilulf died in 616; Theodelinda reigned alone until 628 when she was succeeded by Adaloald. Arioald, the head of the Arian opposition who had married Theodelinda&#x27;s daughter Gundeperga, later deposed Adaloald.

Arioald was succeeded by Rothari, regarded by many authorities as the most energetic of all Lombard kings. He extended his dominions, conquering Liguria in 643 and the remaining part of the Byzantine territories of inner Veneto, including the Roman city of &quot;Opitergium&quot; (Oderzo). Rothari also made the famous edict bearing his name, the &quot;Edictum Rothari&quot;, which established the laws and the customs of his people in Latin: the edict did not apply to the tributaries of the Lombards, who could retain their own laws. Rothari&#x27;s son Rodoald succeeded him in 652, still very young, and was killed by his opponents.

At the death of King Aripert I in 661, the kingdom was split between his children Perctarit, who set his capital in Milan, and Godepert, who reigned from Pavia (Ticinum). Perctarit was overthrown by Grimoald, son of Gisulf, duke of Friuli and Benevento since 647. Perctarit fled to the Avars and then to the Franks. Grimoald managed to regain control over the duchies and deflected the late attempt of the Byzantine emperor Constans II to conquer southern Italy. He also defeated the Franks. At Grimoald&#x27;s death in 671 Perctarit returned and promoted tolerance between Arians and Catholics, but he could not defeat the Arian party, led by Arachi, duke of Trento, who submitted only to his son, the philo-Catholic Cunincpert.

The Lombards engaged in fierce battles with Slavic peoples during these years: from 623 to 626 the Lombards unsuccessfully attacked the Carantanians, and, in 663–64, the Slavs raided the Vipava Valley and the Friuli.

====Catholic monarchy====

Religious strife and the Slavic raids remained a source of struggle in the following years. In 705, the Friuli Lombards were defeated and lost the land to the west of the Soča River, namely the Gorizia Hills and the Venetian Slovenia. A new ethnic border was established that has lasted for over 1200 years up until the present time.

The Lombard reign began to recover only with Liutprand the Lombard (king from 712), son of Ansprand and successor of the brutal Aripert II. He managed to regain a certain control over Spoleto and Benevento, and, taking advantage of the disagreements between the Pope and Byzantium concerning the reverence of icons, he annexed the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchy of Rome. He also helped the Frankish marshal Charles Martel drive back the Arabs. The Slavs were defeated in the Battle of Lavariano, when they tried to conquer the Friulian Plain in 720. Liutprand&#x27;s successor Aistulf conquered Ravenna for the Lombards for the first time but had to relinquish it when he was subsequently defeated by the king of the Franks, Pippin III, who was called by the Pope.

After the death of Aistulf, Ratchis attempted to become king of Lombardy, but he was deposed by Desiderius, duke of Tuscany, the last Lombard to rule as king. Desiderius managed to take Ravenna definitively, ending the Byzantine presence in northern Italy. He decided to reopen struggles against the Pope, who was supporting the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento against him, and entered Rome in 772, the first Lombard king to do so. But when Pope Hadrian I called for help from the powerful Frankish king Charlemagne, Desiderius was defeated at Susa and besieged in Pavia, while his son Adelchis was forced to open the gates of Verona to Frankish troops. Desiderius surrendered in 774, and Charlemagne, in an utterly novel decision, took the title &quot;King of the Lombards&quot;. Before then the Germanic kingdoms had frequently conquered each other, but none had adopted the title of King of another people. Charlemagne took part of the Lombard territory to create the Papal States.

The Lombardy region in Italy, which includes the cities of Brescia, Bergamo, Milan, and the old capital Pavia, is a reminder of the presence of the Lombards.

===Later history===
====Falling to the Franks and the Duchy of Benevento, 774–849====
Though the kingdom centred on Pavia in the north fell to Charlemagne and the Franks in 774, the Lombard-controlled territory to the south of the Papal States was never subjugated by Charlemagne or his descendants. In 774, Duke Arechis II of Benevento, whose duchy had only nominally been under royal authority, though certain kings had been effective at making their power known in the south, claimed that Benevento was the successor state of the kingdom. He tried to turn Benevento into a &quot;secundum Ticinum&quot;: a second Pavia. He tried to claim the kingship, but with no support and no chance of a coronation in Pavia.

Charlemagne came down with an army, and his son Louis the Pious sent men, to force the Beneventan duke to submit, but his submission and promises were never kept and Arechis and his successors were &quot;de facto&quot; independent. The Beneventan dukes took the title &quot;prínceps&quot; (prince) instead of that of king.

The Lombards of southern Italy were thereafter in the anomalous position of holding land claimed by two empires: the Carolingian Empire to the north and west and the Byzantine Empire to the east. They typically made pledges and promises of tribute to the Carolingians, but effectively remained outside Frankish control. Benevento meanwhile grew to its greatest extent yet when it imposed a tribute on the Duchy of Naples, which was tenuously loyal to Byzantium and even conquered the Neapolitan city of Amalfi in 838. At one point in the reign of Sicard, Lombard control covered most of southern Italy save the very south of Apulia and Calabria and Naples, with its nominally attached cities. It was during the ninth century that a strong Lombard presence became entrenched in formerly Greek Apulia. However, Sicard had opened up the south to the invasive actions of the Saracens in his war with Andrew II of Naples and when he was assassinated in 839, Amalfi declared independence and two factions fought for power in Benevento, crippling the principality and making it susceptible to external enemies.

The civil war lasted ten years and ended with a peace treaty imposed in 849 by Emperor Louis II, the only Frankish king to exercise actual sovereignty over the Lombard states. The treaty divided the kingdom into two states: the Principality of Benevento and the Principality of Salerno, with its capital at Salerno on the Tyrrhenian Sea.

====Southern Italy and the Arabs, 836–915====

Andrew II of Naples hired Islamic mercenaries and formed a Muslim-Christian alliance for his war with Sicard of Benevento in 836; Sicard responded with other Muslim mercenaries. The Saracens initially concentrated their attacks on Sicily and Byzantine Italy, but soon Radelchis I of Benevento called in more mercenaries, who destroyed Capua in 841. Landulf the Old founded the present-day Capua, &quot;New Capua&quot;, on a nearby hill. In general, the Lombard princes were less inclined to ally with the Saracens than with their Greek neighbours of Amalfi, Gaeta, Naples, and Sorrento. Guaifer of Salerno, however, briefly put himself under Muslim suzerainty.

In 847 a large Muslim force seized Bari, until then a Lombard gastaldate under the control of Pandenulf. Saracen incursions proceeded northwards until Adelchis of Benevento sought the help of his suzerain, Louis II, who allied with the Byzantine emperor Basil I to expel the Arabs from Bari in 869. An Arab landing force was defeated by the emperor in 871. Adelchis and Louis remained at war until the death of Louis in 875. Adelchis regarded himself as the true successor of the Lombard kings, and in that capacity he amended the &quot;Edictum Rothari&quot;, the last Lombard ruler to do so.

After the death of Louis, Landulf II of Capua briefly flirted with a Saracen alliance, but Pope John VIII convinced him to break it off. Guaimar I of Salerno fought the Saracens with Byzantine troops. Throughout this period the Lombard princes swung in allegiance from one party to another. Finally, towards 915, Pope John X managed to unite the Christian princes of southern Italy against the Saracen establishments on the Garigliano river. The Saracens were ousted from Italy in the Battle of the Garigliano in 915.

====Lombard principalities in the tenth century====

The independent state of Salerno inspired the gastalds of Capua to move towards independence, and by the end of the century they were styling themselves &quot;princes&quot; and as a third Lombard state. The Capuan and Beneventan states were united by Atenulf I of Capua in 900. He subsequently declared them to be in perpetual union, and they were separated only in 982, on the death of Pandulf Ironhead. With all of the Lombard south under his control, except Salerno, Atenulf felt safe to use the title &quot;Princeps Gentis Langobardorum&quot; (&quot;prince of the Lombard people&quot;), which Arechis II had begun using in 774. Among Atenulf&#x27;s successors the principality was ruled jointly by fathers, sons, brothers, cousins, and uncles for the greater part of the century. 

Meanwhile, the prince Gisulf I of Salerno began using the title &quot;Langobardorum Gentis Princeps&quot; around mid-century, but the ideal of a united Lombard principality was realised only in December 977, when Gisulf died and his domains were inherited by Pandulf Ironhead, who temporarily held almost all Italy south of Rome and brought the Lombards into an alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. His territories were divided upon his death.

Landulf the Red of Benevento and Capua tried to conquer the principality of Salerno with the help of John III of Naples, but with the aid of Mastalus I of Amalfi, Gisulf repulsed him. The rulers of Benevento and Capua made several attempts on Byzantine Apulia at this time, but late in the century, the Byzantines, under the stiff rule of Basil II, gained ground on the Lombards.

According to the &quot;Catalogum Principum Salerni&quot;, the Prince of &quot;langobard Salerno&quot; Guaimar IV ruled for 34 years and 17 days. He conquered and was: Duke of Amalfi (1039–1052), Duke of Gaeta (1040–1041), and Prince of Capua (1038–1047) in Southern Italy over the period from 1027 to 1052. He was an important figure in the final phase of Byzantine authority in the Mezzogiorno and the commencement of Norman power. Guaimar&#x27;s legacy includes his dominion, either by conquest or otherwise, over Salerno, Amalfi, Gaeta, Naples, Sorrento, Apulia, Calabria, and Capua at one time or another. He was the last great Lombard prince of the south, but perhaps he is best known for his character, which the Lord Norwich sums up this way: &quot;...without once breaking a promise or betraying a trust. Up to the day he died his honour and good faith had never once been called in question.&quot;. Salerno in these decades was the main and more rich city (called &quot;Opulenta Salernum&quot;) in southern Italy, even because of the &quot;Schola Medica Salernitana&quot; (the first &quot;university&quot; of medicine in Europe). 

After the assassination of Guaimar IV the Principality of Salerno started to be dominated more and more by the Normans: in 1077 ended the history of the Langobards in Italy when this Principality was conquered by the Norman Robert Guiscard.

The principal source for the history of the Lombard principalities in this period is the &quot;Chronicon Salernitanum&quot;, composed late in the tenth century at Salerno.

====Norman conquest, 1017–1078====

The diminished Beneventan principality soon lost its independence to the papacy and declined in importance until it fell in the Norman conquest of southern Italy. The Normans, first called in by the Lombards to fight the Byzantines for control of Apulia and Calabria (under the likes of Melus of Bari and Arduin, among others), had become rivals for hegemony in the south. The Salernitan principality experienced a golden age under Guaimar III and Guaimar IV, but under Gisulf II, the principality shrank to insignificance and fell in 1078 to Robert Guiscard, who had married Gisulf&#x27;s sister Sichelgaita. The Capua principality was hotly contested during the reign of the hated Pandulf IV, the &quot;Wolf of the Abruzzi&quot;, and, under his son, it fell, almost without contest, to the Norman Richard Drengot (1058). The Capuans revolted against Norman rule in 1091, expelling Richard&#x27;s grandson Richard II and setting up one Lando IV.

Capua was again put under Norman rule after the Siege of Capua of 1098 and the city quickly declined in importance under a series of ineffective Norman rulers. The independent status of these Lombard states is in general attested by the ability of their rulers to switch suzerains at will. Often the legal vassal of the pope or the emperor (either Byzantine or Holy Roman), they were the real power-brokers in the south until their erstwhile allies the Normans rose to preeminence.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; in September 2018 found strong genetic similarities between Lombards of Italy and earlier Lombards of Central Europe. Lombard males were primarily carriers of subclades of haplogroup R1b and I2a2a1, both of which are common among Germanic peoples. Lombard males were found to be more genetically homogeneous than Lombard females. The evidence suggested that the Lombards originated in Central/Northern Europe, and were a patriarchal people who settled Central Europe and then later Italy through a migration from the north.

A genetic study published in &quot;Science Advances&quot; in September 2018 examined the remains of a Lombard male buried at an Alemannic graveyard. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1b1a2a1a1c2b2b and the maternal haplogroup H65a. The graveyard also included the remains of a Frankish and a Byzantine male, both of whom were also carriers of subclades of the paternal haplogroup R1b1a2a1a1. The Lombard, Frankish and Byzantine males were all found to be closely related, and displayed close genetic links to Northern Europe, particularly Lithuania and Iceland.

A genetic study published in the &quot;European Journal of Human Genetics&quot; in January 2019 examined the mtDNA of a large number of early-medieval Lombard remains from Central Europe and Italy. These individuals were found to be closely related and displayed strong genetic links to Central Europe. The evidence suggested that the Lombard settlement of Italy was the result of a migration from the north involving both males and females.

A 2024 paper found that the Lombards of Italy were best modelled by a Jutlandic Iron Age source, consistent with an origin in Jutland or northern Germany.

==Culture==
===Language===
Unless Cimbrian and Mòcheno represent surviving dialects, the Lombardic language is extinct. It declined beginning in the seventh century, but may have been in scattered use until as late as about the year 1000. Only fragments of the language have survived, the main evidence being individual words quoted in Latin texts. In the absence of Lombardic texts, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the language&#x27;s morphology and syntax. The genetic classification of the language depends entirely on phonology. Since there is evidence that Lombardic participated in, and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for, the High German consonant shift, it is usually classified as an Upper German dialect descended from Elbe Germanic.
Lombardic fragments are preserved in runic inscriptions. Primary source texts include short inscriptions in the Elder Futhark, among them the &quot;bronze capsule of Schretzheim&quot; (c. 600) and the silver belt buckle found in Pforzen, Ostallgäu (Schwaben). A number of Latin texts include Lombardic names, and Lombardic legal texts contain terms taken from the legal vocabulary of the vernacular. In 2005, Emilia Denčeva argued that the inscription of the Pernik sword may be Lombardic.

The Italian language preserves a large number of Lombardic words, although it is not always easy to distinguish them from other Germanic borrowings such as those from Gothic or from Frankish. They often bear some resemblance to English words, as Lombardic was akin to Old Saxon. For instance, &quot;landa&quot; from &quot;land&quot;, &quot;guardia&quot; from &quot;wardan&quot; (warden), &quot;guerra&quot; from &quot;werra&quot; (war), &quot;ricco&quot; from &quot;rikki&quot; (rich), and &quot;guadare&quot; from &quot;wadjan&quot; (to wade).

The &quot;Codice diplomatico longobardo&quot;, a collection of legal documents, makes reference to many Lombardic terms, some of them still in use in the Italian language:

&quot;barba&quot; (beard), &quot;marchio&quot; (mark), &quot;maniscalco&quot; (blacksmith), &quot;aia&quot; (courtyard), &quot;braida&quot; (suburban meadow), &quot;borgo&quot; (burg, village), &quot;fara&quot; (fundamental unity of Lombard social and military organization, presently used as toponym), &quot;picco&quot; (peak, mountain top, also used as toponym), &quot;sala&quot; (hall, room, also used as toponym), &quot;staffa&quot; (stirrup), &quot;stalla&quot; (stable), &quot;sculdascio&quot;, &quot;faida&quot; (feud), &quot;manigoldo&quot; (scoundrel), &quot;sgherro&quot; (henchman); &quot;fanone&quot; (baleen), &quot;stamberga&quot; (hovel); &quot;anca&quot; (hip), &quot;guancia&quot; (cheek), &quot;nocca&quot; (knuckle), &quot;schiena&quot; (back); &quot;gazza&quot; (magpie), &quot;martora&quot; (marten); &quot;gualdo&quot; (wood, presently used as toponym), &quot;pozza&quot; (pool); verbs like &quot;bussare&quot; (to knock), &quot;piluccare&quot; (to peck), &quot;russare&quot; (to snore).

===Social structure===

====Migration Period society====
During their stay at the mouth of the Elbe, the Lombards came into contact with other western Germanic populations, such as the Saxons and the Frisians. From these populations, which had long been in contact with the Celts (especially the Saxons), they adopted a rigid social organization into castes, rarely present in other Germanic peoples.

The Lombard kings can be traced back as early as c. 380 and thus to the beginning of the Great Migration. Kingship developed among the Germanic peoples when the unity of a single military command was found necessary. Schmidt believed that the Germanic tribes were divided into cantons and that the earliest government was a general assembly that selected canton chiefs and war leaders in times of conflict. All such figures were probably selected from a caste of nobility. As a result of the wars of their wanderings, royal power developed such that the king became the representative of the people, but the influence of the people on the government did not fully disappear. Paul the Deacon gives an account of the Lombard tribal structure during the migration:

... in order that they might increase the number of their warriors, [the Lombards] confer liberty upon many whom they deliver from the yoke of bondage, and that the freedom of these may be regarded as established, they confirm it in their accustomed way by an arrow, uttering certain words of their country in confirmation of the fact.

Complete emancipation appears to have been granted only among the Franks and the Lombards.

====Society of the Catholic kingdom====

Lombard society was divided into classes comparable to those found in the other Germanic successor states of Rome, Frankish Gaul and Spain under the Visigoths. There was a noble class, a class of free persons beneath them, a class of unfree non-slaves (serfs), and finally slaves. The aristocracy itself was poorer, more urbanised, and less landed than elsewhere. Aside from the richest and most powerful of the dukes and the king himself, Lombard noblemen tended to live in cities (unlike their Frankish counterparts) and hold little more than twice as much in land as the merchant class (a far cry from provincial Frankish aristocrats who held vast swathes of land, hundreds of times larger than those beneath his status). The aristocracy by the eighth century was highly dependent on the king for means of income related especially to judicial duties: many Lombard nobles are referred to in contemporary documents as &quot;iudices&quot; (judges) even when their offices had important military and legislative functions as well.

The freemen of the Lombard kingdom were far more numerous than in Frankish lands, especially in the eighth century, when they are almost invisible in surviving documentary evidence. Smallholders, owner-cultivators, and rentiers are the most numerous types of person in surviving diplomata for the Lombard kingdom. They may have owned more than half of the land in Lombard Italy. The freemen were &quot;exercitales&quot; and &quot;viri devoti&quot;, that is, soldiers and &quot;devoted men&quot; (a military term like &quot;retainers&quot;); they formed the levy of the Lombard army, and they were sometimes, if infrequently, called to serve, though this seems not to have been their preference. The small landed class, however, lacked the political influence necessary with the king (and the dukes) to control the politics and legislation of the kingdom. The aristocracy was more thoroughly powerful politically if not economically in Italy than in contemporary Gaul and Spain.
The urbanisation of Lombard Italy was characterised by the (or &quot;city as islands&quot;). It appears from archaeology that the great cities of Lombard Italy—Pavia, Lucca, Siena, Arezzo, Milan—were themselves formed of small urban cores within the old Roman city walls. The cities of the Roman Empire had been partially destroyed in the series of wars of the fifth and sixth centuries. Many sectors were left in ruins and ancient monuments became fields of grass used as pastures for animals, thus the Roman Forum became the &quot;Campo Vaccino&quot;, the field of cows. The portions of the cities that remained intact were small, modest, contained a cathedral or major church (often sumptuously decorated), and a few public buildings and townhouses of the aristocracy. Few buildings of importance were stone, most were wood. In the end, the inhabited parts of the cities were separated from one another by stretches of pasture even within the city walls.

===Religious history===

The legend from Origo may hint that initially, before the passage from Scandinavia to the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, the Lombards worshiped the Vanir. Later, in contact with other Germanic populations, they adopted the worship of the Æsir: an evolution that marked the passage from the adoration of deities related to fertility and the earth to the cult of warlike gods.

In chapter 40 of his &quot;Germania&quot;, Roman historian Tacitus, discussing the Suebian tribes of Germania, writes that the Lombards were one of the Suebian tribes united in worship of the deity Nerthus, who is often identified with the Norse goddess Freyja. The other tribes were the Reudigni, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suarines and Nuitones.

St. Barbatus of Benevento observed many pagan rituals and traditions among the Lombards authorised by the Duke Romuald, son of King Grimoald:

====Christianisation====
The Lombards first adopted Christianity while still in Pannonia, but their conversion and Christianisation was largely nominal and far from complete. During the reign of Wacho, they were Orthodox Catholics allied with the Byzantine Empire, but Alboin converted to Arianism as an ally of the Ostrogoths and invaded Italy. All these Christian conversions primarily affected the aristocracy, while the common people remained pagan.

In Italy, the Lombards were intensively Christianised, and the pressure to convert to Orthodox Catholicism was great. With the Bavarian queen Theodelinda, an Orthodox Catholic, the monarchy was brought under heavy Catholic influence. After initial support for the anti-Rome party in the Schism of the Three Chapters, Theodelinda remained a close contact and supporter of Pope Gregory I. In 603, Adaloald, the heir to the throne, received Orthodox Catholic baptism. However, the lack of spiritual involvement of most of the Lombards in religious disputes remained constant, so much so that the opposition between Orthodox Catholics, on the one hand, and pagans, Arians and schismatics, on the other, soon took on political significance. The supporters of Roman orthodoxy, led by the Bavarian dynasty, were politically the proponents of greater integration with the Romans, accompanied by a strategy of preserving the status quo with the Byzantines. Arians, pagans and schismatics, rooted above all in the northeastern regions of the kingdom (Austria), were instead interpreters of the preservation of the warlike and aggressive spirit of the people. Thus, to the &quot;pro-Catholic&quot; phase of Agilulf, Theodolinda and Adaloald followed, from 626 (Arioald&#x27;s accession to the throne) to 690 (definitive defeat of the rebel Alahis), a long phase of the revival of Arianism, embodied by militarily aggressive kings like Rothari and Grimoald. However, tolerance towards Orthodox Catholics was never questioned by the various kings, also safeguarded by the influential contribution of the respective queens (largely chosen, for reasons of dynastic legitimacy, among the Orthodox Catholic princesses of the Bavarian dynasty).

In the seventh century, the nominally Christian aristocracy of Benevento was still practising pagan rituals such as sacrifices in &quot;sacred&quot; woods. By the end of the reign of Cunincpert, however, the Lombards were more or less completely Catholicised. Under Liutprand Orthodox Catholicism became tangible as the king sought to justify his title &quot;rex totius Italiae&quot; by uniting the south of the peninsula with the north, thereby bringing together his Italo-Roman and Germanic subjects into one Catholic State.

====Beneventan Christianity====
The Duchy and eventually Principality of Benevento in southern Italy developed a unique Christian rite in the seventh and eighth centuries. The Beneventan rite is more closely related to the liturgy of the Ambrosian rite than to the Roman rite. The Beneventan rite has not survived in its complete form, although most of the principal feasts and several feasts of local significance are extant. The Beneventan rite appears to have been less complete, less systematic, and more liturgically flexible than the Roman rite.

Characteristic of this rite was the Beneventan chant, a Lombard-influenced chant that bore similarities to the Ambrosian chant of Milan. The Beneventan chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Beneventan rite; many Beneventan chants were assigned multiple roles when inserted into Gregorian chantbooks, appearing variously as antiphons, offertories, and communions, for example. It was eventually supplanted by the Gregorian chant in the eleventh century.

The chief centre of the Beneventan chant was Montecassino, one of the first and greatest abbeys of Western monasticism. Gisulf II of Benevento had donated a large swathe of land to Montecassino in 744, and that became the basis for an important state, the &quot;Terra Sancti Benedicti&quot;, which was a subject only to Rome. The Cassinese influence on Christianity in southern Italy was immense. Montecassino was also the starting point for another characteristic of Beneventan monasticism, the use of the distinct Beneventan script, a clear, angular script derived from the Roman cursive as used by the Lombards.

===Art===
During their nomadic phase, the Lombards primarily created art that was easily carried with them, like arms and jewellery. Though relatively little of this has survived, it bears resemblance to the similar endeavours of other Germanic tribes of central Europe from the same era.

The first major modifications to the Germanic style of the Lombards came in Pannonia and especially in Italy, under the influence of local, Byzantine, and Christian styles. The conversions from nomadism and paganism to settlement and Christianity also opened up new arenas of artistic expressions, such as architecture (especially churches) and its accompanying decorative arts (such as frescoes).
====Architecture====

Few Lombard buildings have survived. Most have been lost, rebuilt, or renovated at some point, so they preserve little of their original Lombard structure. Lombard architecture was well-studied in the twentieth century, and the four-volume &quot;Lombard Architecture&quot; (1919) by Arthur Kingsley Porter is a &quot;monument of illustrated history&quot;.

The small Oratorio di Santa Maria in Valle in Cividale del Friuli is probably one of the oldest preserved examples of Lombard architecture, as Cividale was the first Lombard city in Italy. Parts of Lombard constructions have been preserved in Pavia (San Pietro in Ciel d&#x27;Oro, crypts of Sant&#x27;Eusebio and San Giovanni Domnarum) and Monza (cathedral). The &quot;Basilic autariana&quot; in Fara Gera d&#x27;Adda near Bergamo and the church of San Salvatore in Brescia also have Lombard elements. All these buildings are in northern Italy (Langobardia major), but by far the best-preserved Lombard structure is in southern Italy (Langobardia minor). The Church of Santa Sofia in Benevento was erected in 760 by Duke Arechis II, and it preserves Lombard frescoes on the walls and even Lombard capitals on the columns.

Lombard architecture flourished under the impulse provided by the Catholic monarchs like Theodelinda, Liutprand, and Desiderius to the foundation of monasteries to further their political control. Bobbio Abbey was founded during this time.

Some of the late Lombard structures of the ninth and tenth centuries have been found to contain elements of style associated with Romanesque architecture and so have been dubbed &quot;first Romanesque&quot;. These edifices are considered, along with some similar buildings in southern France and Catalonia, to mark a transitory phase between the Pre-Romanesque and full-fledged Romanesque.

<doc id="18013" wikidata="Q133147" url="?curid=18013" title="Loki">
<text>Loki is a god in Norse mythology. He is the son of Fárbauti (a jötunn) and Laufey (a goddess), and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr. Loki is married to the goddess Sigyn and they have two sons, Narfi or Nari and Váli. By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent Jörmungandr. In the form of a mare, Loki was impregnated by the stallion Svaðilfari and gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir.

Like other gods, Loki is a shape shifter and in separate sources appears in the form of a salmon, a mare, a fly, and possibly an elderly woman named Þökk (Old Norse &#x27;thanks&#x27;). While sometimes friendly with the gods, Loki engineers the death of the beloved god Baldr. For this, Odin&#x27;s specially engendered son Váli binds Loki with the entrails of one of his sons, where he writhes in pain. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, this son, Nari or Narfi, is killed by another of Loki&#x27;s sons, who is also called Váli. The goddess Skaði is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes.

Loki is foretold to eventually break free from his bonds and, among the forces of the jötnar, to go to battle with the gods, during which time his children play a key role in the destruction of all but two humans over the events of Ragnarök. Loki has a particular enmity with the god Heimdallr. The two are in fact prophesied to kill one another during Ragnarök.

Loki is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources: the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; the Norwegian Rune Poems, in the poetry of skalds, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the Snaptun Stone, the Kirkby Stephen Stone and the Gosforth Cross. Scholars have debated Loki&#x27;s origins and role in Norse mythology, which some have described as that of a trickster god. Loki has been depicted in, or referenced in, a variety of media in modern popular culture.

==Etymology and alternate names==
The etymology of the name &quot;Loki&quot; has been extensively debated. The name has been associated with the Old Norse word &quot;logi&quot; (&#x27;flame&#x27;) at times, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese &quot;Lokki&quot;, Danish &quot;Lokkemand&quot;, Norwegian &quot;Loke&quot; and &quot;Lokke&quot;, Swedish &quot;Luki&quot; and &quot;Luku&quot;) point to an origin in the Germanic root *&quot;luk&quot;-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish &quot;lockanät&quot; and Faroese &quot;lokkanet&quot; (&#x27;cobweb&#x27;, literally &#x27;Lokke&#x27;s web&#x27;) and Faroese &quot;lokki&quot;~&quot;grindalokki&quot;~&quot;grindalokkur&quot;, &#x27;daddy-long-legs&#x27; referring both to crane flies and harvestmen, as well as modern Swedish &quot;lockespindlar&quot; (&quot;Locke-spiders&quot;). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in &quot;n&quot;- like &quot;Nokk(e)&quot;, but this corresponds to the *&quot;luk&quot;- etymology insofar, as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *&quot;hnuk&quot;-, in contexts where western varieties used *&quot;luk&quot;-: &quot;&quot;nokke&quot; corresponds to &quot;nøkkel&quot;&quot; (&#x27;key&#x27; in Eastern Scandinavian) &quot;as &quot;loki&quot;~&quot;lokke&quot; to &quot;lykil&quot;&quot; (&#x27;key&#x27; in Western Scandinavian).

While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki&#x27;s apocalyptic role at Ragnarök, &quot;there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop. Hence, it is natural that Loki is the inventor of the fishnet, which consists of loops and knots, and that the word &quot;loki&quot; (&quot;lokke&quot;, &quot;lokki&quot;, &quot;loke&quot;, &quot;luki&quot;) is a term for makers of cobwebs: spiders and the like.&quot; Though not prominent in the oldest sources, this identity as a &quot;tangler&quot; may be the etymological meaning of Loki&#x27;s name.

In various poems from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; (stanza 2 of &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, stanza 41 of &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, and stanza 26 of &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;), and sections of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; (chapter 32 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, stanza 8 of &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, and stanza 1 of &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot;) Loki is alternatively referred to as &quot;Loptr&quot;, which is generally considered derived from Old Norse &quot;lopt&quot; meaning &quot;air&quot;, and therefore points to an association with the air.

The name &quot;Hveðrungr&quot; (Old Norse &#x27;?roarer&#x27;) is also used in reference to Loki, occurring in names for Hel (such as in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, where she is called &quot;hveðrungs mær&quot;) and in reference to Fenrir (as in &quot;Völuspa&quot;).

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Loki appears (or is referenced) in the poems &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, &quot;Reginsmál&quot;, &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;, and &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;.

====&quot;Völuspá&quot;====
In stanza 35 of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, a völva tells Odin that, among many other things, she sees Sigyn sitting very unhappily with her bound husband, Loki, under a &quot;grove of hot springs&quot;. In stanza 51, during the events of Ragnarök, Loki appears free from his bonds and is referred to as the &quot;brother of Býleistr&quot; (here transcribed as &quot;Byleist&quot;):
In stanza 54, after consuming Odin and being killed by Odin&#x27;s son Víðarr, Fenrir is described as &quot;Loki&#x27;s kinsman&quot;.

====&quot;Lokasenna&quot;====
The poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Loki&#x27;s Flyting&quot;) centers around Loki flyting with other gods; Loki puts forth two stanzas of insults while the receiving figure responds with a single stanza, and then another figure chimes in. The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that Ægir, a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and elves. There, the gods praise Ægir&#x27;s servers Fimafeng and Eldir. Loki &quot;could not bear to hear that&quot;, and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.

=====Entrance and rejection=====
Loki comes out of the woods and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their &quot;weapons and their prowess in war&quot; and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and &quot;mix their mead with malice&quot;. Eldir responds that &quot;if shouting and fighting you pour out on&quot; to the gods, &quot;they&#x27;ll wipe it off on you&quot;. Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.

=====Re-entrance and insults=====
Breaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of &quot;the famous mead&quot;. Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The skaldic god Bragi is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite. Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:
Odin then asks his silent son Víðarr to stand up, so that Loki (here referred to as the &quot;wolf&#x27;s father&quot;) may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in Ægir&#x27;s hall. Víðarr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods &quot;with hatred&quot;. Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being &quot;wary of war&quot; and &quot;shy of shooting&quot;. Bragi responds that, were they outside of Ægir&#x27;s hall, Bragi would be holding Loki&#x27;s head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a &quot;bench-ornament&quot;, and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.

The goddess Iðunn interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in Ægir&#x27;s hall. Loki tells Iðunn to be silent, calling her the most &quot;man-crazed&quot; of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother&#x27;s slayer. Iðunn says that she will not say words of blame in Ægir&#x27;s hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she does not want the two of them to fight. The goddess Gefjun asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that &quot;all living things love him&quot;. Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun&#x27;s heart was once seduced by a &quot;white boy&quot; who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.

Odin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin&#x27;s own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he&#x27;s often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced seiðr (a type of sorcery) on the island of &quot;Samsey&quot; (now Samsø, Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.

Frigg, a major deity who is married to Odin, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of Fjörgyn, a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin&#x27;s brothers Vili and Vé into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son Baldr in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.

The goddess Freyja declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja&#x27;s lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to &quot;yelp about wicked things&quot; that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother Freyr, when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. Njörðr (Freyja and Freyr&#x27;s father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or &quot;someone else&quot; beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a &quot;pervert god coming here who has borne children&quot;.

Loki tells Njörðr to be silent, recalling Njörðr&#x27;s status as once having been a hostage from the Vanir to the Æsir during the Æsir-Vanir War, that the &quot;daughters of Hymir&quot; once used Njörðr &quot;as a pisspot&quot;, urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Njörðr responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the Æsir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the Æsir. Loki tells Njörðr to maintain his moderation, and that he will not keep it secret any longer that Njörðr fathered this son with his sister (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.

The god Tyr defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot &quot;deal straight with people&quot;, and points out that it was Loki&#x27;s son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr&#x27;s hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki&#x27;s son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of Ragnarök. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr&#x27;s wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this &quot;injury&quot;, further calling him a &quot;wretch&quot;.

Freyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until Ragnarök. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort Gerðr with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at Ragnarök. Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr&#x27;s ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he is proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he is said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and dais when men go to battle.

The god Heimdallr says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he will not stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a &quot;hateful life&quot;, that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess Skaði says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and &quot;playing&quot; with his &quot;tail-wagging&quot;, he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son&#x27;s guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was &quot;first and foremost&quot; with the other gods at the killing of Skaði&#x27;s father, Þjazi. Skaði says that, with these events in mind, &quot;baneful advice&quot; will always come from her &quot;sanctuaries and plains&quot; to Loki. Loki says that Skaði was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the &quot;son of Laufey&quot;) when Skaði once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall &quot;shameful deeds&quot;.

Sif goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the Æsir, she is singularly blameless. Loki &quot;takes the horn&quot;, drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif and Loki had been lovers, despite her marriage to Thor (an affair that is otherwise unattested). Beyla (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is &quot;much imbued with malice&quot;, that no worse woman has ever been among the &quot;Æsir&#x27;s children&quot;, and calling her a bad &quot;serving-wench&quot;.

=====The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki=====
Thor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an &quot;evil creature&quot;, stating that with his hammer Mjöllnir he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor will not be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at Ragnarök. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mjöllnir, adding that he will throw Loki &quot;up on the roads to the east&quot;, and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a &quot;hero&quot;, and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mjöllnir, and adding that every one of Loki&#x27;s bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor&#x27;s threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the Skrýmir (Útgarða-Loki in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mjöllnir, and says he will send Loki to Hel, below the gates of Nágrind.

In response to Thor, Loki says that he &quot;spoke before the Æsir&quot;, and &quot;before the sons of the Æsir&quot; what his &quot;spirit urged&quot; him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of &quot;Lokasenna&quot; with a final stanza:
Following this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a salmon and hid in the waterfall of Franangrsfors, where the Æsir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son Nari, and his son Narfi changed into a wolf. Skaði fastened a venomous snake over Loki&#x27;s face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, his spouse, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.

====&quot;Þrymskviða&quot;====
In the poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess Freyja, and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir. Freyja agrees, saying she would lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.

In Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr sits on a burial mound, plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the Elves; why is Loki alone in the Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir: that Thor&#x27;s hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr says that he has hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to marry him. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods.

Thor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he is still in the air as &quot;tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies&quot;. Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that Þrymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to marry Þrymr. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to Jötunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the Æsir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed Brísingamen, falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.

As a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women&#x27;s clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as &quot;son of Laufey&quot;) interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mjöllnir, and points out that without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.

After riding together in Thor&#x27;s goat-driven chariot, the two, disguised, arrive in Jötunheimr. Þrymr commands the jötnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to marry him. Þrymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.

Early in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with Þrymr and the assembled jötnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. Þrymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a &quot;very shrewd maid&quot;, makes the excuse that &quot;Freyja&#x27;s&quot; behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts &quot;Freyja&#x27;s&quot; veil and wants to kiss &quot;her&quot; until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because &quot;Freyja&quot; had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.

The &quot;wretched sister&quot; of the jötnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from &quot;Freyja&quot;, and the jötnar bring out Mjöllnir to &quot;sanctify the bride&quot;, to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by &quot;the hand&quot; of the goddess Vár. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes Þrymr, beats all of the jötnar, and kills the &quot;older sister&quot; of the jötnar.

====&quot;Reginsmál&quot;====
Loki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem &quot;Reginsmál&quot;. The prose introduction to &quot;Reginsmál&quot; details that, while the hero Sigurd was being fostered by Regin, son of Hreidmar, Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, Hœnir, and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; Andvari, who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a pike, and Ótr, who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.

While the three gods are at the falls, Ótr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead Ótr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar &quot;seized them and made them ransom their lives&quot; in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.

Loki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess Rán, borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a &quot;norn of misfortune&quot; in his &quot;early days&quot;. Loki responds by asking Andvari &quot;what requital&quot; does mankind get if &quot;they wound each other with words&quot;. Andvari responds that lying men receive a &quot;terrible requital&quot;: having to wade in the river Vadgelmir, and that their suffering will be long.

Loki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring Andvarinaut, which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.

Loki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.

Loki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he does not believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.

====&quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;====
In &quot;Baldr draumar&quot;, Odin has awoken a deceased völva in Hel, and questions her repeatedly about his son Baldr&#x27;s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the völva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until &quot;Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds&quot; and the onset of Ragnarök.

====&quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;====

Loki is referenced in two stanzas in &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot;, found within the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;. The first stanza notes that Loki produced &quot;the wolf&quot; with the jötunn Angrboða, that Loki himself gave birth to the horse Sleipnir by the stallion Svaðilfari, and that Loki (referred to as the &quot;brother of Býleistr&quot;) thirdly gave birth to &quot;the worst of all marvels&quot;. This stanza is followed by:
In the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as &quot;Lopt&quot;. Loki&#x27;s consumption of a woman&#x27;s heart is otherwise unattested.

====&quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;====
In the poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;, a stanza mentions Loki (as &quot;Lopt&quot;) in association with runes. In the poem, Fjölsviðr describes to the hero Svipdagr that Sinmara keeps the weapon Lævateinn within a chest, locked with nine strong locks (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):
===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

====&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;====
The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki&#x27;s role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki&#x27;s contest with Logi, fire personified.

=====High&#x27;s introduction=====

Loki first appears in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; in chapter 20 of the book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, where he is referred to as the &quot;ás called Loki&quot; while the enthroned figure of Third explains to &quot;Gangleri&quot; (King Gylfi in disguise) the goddess Frigg&#x27;s prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of &quot;Lokasenna&quot;.
Loki is more formally introduced by High in chapter 34, where he is &quot;reckoned among the Æsir&quot;, and High states that Loki is called by some &quot;the Æsir&#x27;s calumniator&quot;, &quot;originator of deceits&quot;, and &quot;the disgrace of all gods and men&quot;. High says that Loki&#x27;s alternative name is &quot;Lopt&quot;, that he is the son of the male jötunn Fárbauti, his mother is &quot;Laufey or Nál&quot;, and his brothers are Helblindi and Býleistr. High describes Loki as &quot;pleasing and handsome&quot; in appearance, malicious in character, &quot;very capricious in behaviour&quot;, and as possessing &quot;to a greater degree than others&quot; learned cunning, and &quot;tricks for every purpose&quot;, often getting the Æsir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Sigyn is introduced as being married to Loki, and they have a son named &quot;Nari or Narfi&quot;. Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female jötunn Angrboða from Jötunheimr; the wolf Fenrir, the serpent Jörmungandr, and the female being Hel. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in Jötunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrboða, but worse yet Loki. In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a &quot;pretty terrible&quot;—yet important—family.

=====Loki, Svaðilfari, and Sleipnir=====

In chapter 42, High tells a story set &quot;right at the beginning of the gods&#x27; settlement, when the gods at established Midgard and built Val-Hall&quot;. The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki&#x27;s influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks—to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as &quot;Loki Laufeyjarson&quot;—his surname derived from his mother&#x27;s name, &quot;Laufey&quot;).
The gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Svaðilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Svaðilfari, and &quot;realizing what kind of horse it was&quot;, Svaðilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Svaðilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.

The builder goes into a rage, and when the Æsir realize that the builder is a hrimthurs, they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder&#x27;s skull into shards with the hammer Mjöllnir. However, Loki &quot;had such dealings&quot; with Svaðilfari that &quot;somewhat later&quot; Loki gives birth to a gray foal with eight legs; the horse Sleipnir—&quot;the best horse among gods and men.&quot;

=====Loki, Útgarða-Loki, and Logi=====

In chapter 44, Third reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor&#x27;s chariot, which is pulled by his two goats. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child Þjálfi sucks the bone marrow from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son Þjálfi and their daughter Röskva.
Minus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in Jötunheimr. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of Skrymir, who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.

Thor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skrýmir with his hammer. Skrýmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skrýmir. Skrýmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of Útgarðr it would be better for them to turn back now, for Útgarða-Loki&#x27;s men there will not put up with it. Skrýmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that &quot;there is no report that the Æsir expressed hope for a happy reunion&quot;.

The four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see Útgarða-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.

Útgarða-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. Útgarða-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of Logi to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, Þjálfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.

Thor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor&#x27;s weakness. Útgarða-Loki then calls for his nurse Elli, an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. Útgarða-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, Útgarða-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.

The next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. Útgarða-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor&#x27;s blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.

The contests, too, were an illusion. Útgarða-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (&quot;Logi&quot;, Old Norse &quot;flame&quot;), Þjálfi had raced against thought (&quot;Hugi&quot;, Old Norse &quot;thought&quot;), Thor&#x27;s drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in tides). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, Jörmungandr, and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this &quot;cat&quot;, for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (&quot;Elli&quot;, Old Norse &quot;old age&quot;), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. Útgarða-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for &quot;both sides&quot; if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at Útgarða-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.

===Norwegian rune poem===

Loki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the Norwegian rune poem in connection with the Younger Futhark Bjarkan rune:
According to Bruce Dickins, the reference to &quot;Loki&#x27;s deceit&quot; in the poem &quot;is doubtless to Loki&#x27;s responsibility for Balder&#x27;s death&quot;.

==Archaeological record==

===Snaptun Stone===

In 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, Denmark. Made of soapstone that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; where sons of Ivaldi stitch up Loki&#x27;s lips.

The stone is identified as a hearth stone; the nozzle of the bellows would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans Jørgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is &quot;the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.&quot; The stone is housed and on display at the Moesgård Museum near Aarhus, Denmark.

===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===
A fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, England, features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki. Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white sandstone, and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in Gainford, County Durham and is now housed in the Durham Cathedral Library.

The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.

==Scandinavian folklore==
The notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as &quot;Lokke&quot;. In Jutland, the phrases &quot;Lokke slår sin havre&quot; (&quot;Lokke is reaping his oats&quot;) and &quot;Lokkemand driver sine geder&quot; (&quot;Lokkemand drives his goats&quot;) are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply &quot;Lokke&quot;. In Zealand the name &quot;Lokke lejemand&quot; (&quot;Lokke the Playing Man&quot;) was used. In his study of Loki&#x27;s appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist Axel Olrik cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:

:The expressions: &quot;Lokke (Lokki) sår havre i dag&quot; (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: &quot;Lokke driver i dag med sine geder&quot; (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the diocese of Viborg etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire

And in Thy, from the same source: &quot;... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.&quot; Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an &quot;air phenomenon&quot;, connected with the &quot;home fire&quot;, and as a &quot;teasing creature of the night&quot;.

&quot;Loka Táttur&quot; or &quot;Lokka Táttur&quot; (Faroese &quot;tale—or &quot;þáttr&quot;—of Loki&quot;) is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and Hœnir helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning jötunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.

==Origin and identification with other figures==
Regarding scholarship on Loki, scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre comments (1964) that &quot;more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.&quot;

===Origin===
Loki&#x27;s origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, Jacob Grimm was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a &quot;god of fire&quot;. In 1889, Sophus Bugge theorized Loki to be variant of Lucifer of Christianity, an element of Bugge&#x27;s larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After World War II, four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of Folke Ström, who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a hypostasis of the god Odin. In 1959, Jan de Vries theorized that Loki is a typical example of a trickster figure. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, Anna Birgitta Rooth concluded that Loki was originally a spider. Anne Holtsmark, writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.

===Identification with Lóðurr===
A popular theory proposed by a variety of scholars is that &quot;Lóðurr&quot; is &quot;a third name of Loki/Loptr&quot;. The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, Hœnir and Loki occur as a trio in &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, in the prose prologue to &quot;Reginsmál&quot; and also in the &quot;Loka Táttur&quot; a Faroese ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning &quot;Lóðurr&#x27;s friend&quot; furthermore appears to parallel the kenning &quot;Loptr&#x27;s friend&quot; and Loki is similarly referred to as &quot;Hœnir&#x27;s friend&quot; in &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, seemingly conflicting with the image of Lóðurr as a &quot;mighty and loving&quot; figure. Many scholars, including Jan de Vries and Georges Dumézil, have also identified Lóðurr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur Þorgeirsson suggests that &quot;Loki&quot; and &quot;Lóðurr&quot; were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as Lóður in the rímur &quot;Lokrur&quot;. Þorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, as Snorri does not mention Lóðurr. Since the contents of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the rímur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. Þorgeirsson also points to &quot;Þrymlur&quot; where the same identification is made with Loki and Lóðurr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and Lóðurr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if Lóðurr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.

===Binding===
The scholar John Lindow highlights the recurring pattern of the bound monster in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the &quot;Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment&quot;.

==Modern popular culture==

In the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, &quot;the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic fifth columnist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic Prometheus, a heroic bearer of culture&quot;.

Loki appears in Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera cycle &quot;Ring of the Nibelung&quot; as &quot;Loge&quot; (a play on Old Norse &quot;loge&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as Wotan&#x27;s assistant rather than Donner&#x27;s), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.

In 2008, five black smokers were discovered between Greenland and Norway, the most northerly group so far discovered, and given the name Loki&#x27;s Castle, as their shape reminded discoverers of a fantasy castle, and (a University of Bergen press release says) &quot;Loki&quot; was &quot;an appropriate name for a field that was so difficult to locate&quot;.

In the movie The Mask, the main character Stanley Ipkiss finds Loki&#x27;s mask.

Loki appears in Marvel Comics and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Hiddleston, as a villain (or antihero) who consistently comes into conflict with the superhero Thor, his adopted brother and archenemy. 

Loki is a central character in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;American Gods&quot; and an important character in a few arcs of Gaiman&#x27;s comic &quot;The Sandman&quot;. Loki is also a central figure in the series of fantasy novels by Joanne Harris: &quot;Runemarks&quot;, &quot;Runelight&quot;, &quot;The Gospel of Loki&quot; and &quot;The Testament of Loki&quot;.

In games Asgard&#x27;s Wrath and Asgard&#x27;s Wrath 2.

<text>Lisp (historically LISP, an abbreviation of &quot;list processing&quot;) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
Originally specified in the late 1950s, it is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use, after Fortran. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket, and Clojure.

Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by (though not originally derived from) the notation of Alonzo Church&#x27;s lambda calculus. It quickly became a favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler, and the read–eval–print loop.

The name &quot;LISP&quot; derives from &quot;LISt Processor&quot;. Linked lists are one of Lisp&#x27;s major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.

The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax. All program code is written as &quot;s-expressions&quot;, or parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a list with the function or operator&#x27;s name first, and the arguments following; for instance, a function that takes three arguments would be called as .

==History==
John McCarthy began developing Lisp in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was motivated by a desire to create an AI programming language that would work on the IBM 704, as he believed that &quot;IBM looked like a good bet to pursue Artificial Intelligence research vigorously.&quot; He was inspired by Information Processing Language, which was also based on list processing, but did not use it because it was designed for different hardware and he found an algebraic language more appealing. Due to these factors, he consulted on the design of the Fortran List Processing Language, which was implemented as a Fortran library. However, he was dissatisfied with it because it did not support recursion or a modern if-then-else statement (which was a new concept when lisp was first introduced) .

McCarthy&#x27;s original notation used bracketed &quot;M-expressions&quot; that would be translated into S-expressions. As an example, the M-expression is equivalent to the S-expression . Once Lisp was implemented, programmers rapidly chose to use S-expressions, and M-expressions were abandoned. M-expressions surfaced again with short-lived attempts of MLisp by Horace Enea and CGOL by Vaughan Pratt.

Lisp was first implemented by Steve Russell on an IBM 704 computer using punched cards. Russell was working for McCarthy&#x27;s at the time and realized (to McCarthy&#x27;s surprise) that the Lisp &quot;eval&quot; function could be implemented in machine code.

According to McCarthy
The result was a working Lisp interpreter which could be used to run Lisp programs, or more properly, &quot;evaluate Lisp expressions&quot;.

Two assembly language macros for the IBM 704 became the primitive operations for decomposing lists: car (&quot;Contents of the Address part of Register&quot; number) and cdr (&quot;Contents of the Decrement part of Register&quot; number), where &quot;register&quot; refers to registers of the computer&#x27;s central processing unit (CPU). Lisp dialects still use and ( and ) for the operations that return the first item in a list and the rest of the list, respectively.

McCarthy published Lisp&#x27;s design in a paper in &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; on April 1, 1960, entitled &quot;Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I&quot;. He showed that with a few simple operators and a notation for anonymous functions borrowed from Church, one can build a Turing-complete language for algorithms.

The first complete Lisp compiler, written in Lisp, was implemented in 1962 by Tim Hart and Mike Levin at MIT, and could be compiled by simply having an existing LISP interpreter interpret the compiler code, producing machine code output able to be executed at a 40-fold improvement in speed over that of the interpreter. This compiler introduced the Lisp model of incremental compilation, in which compiled and interpreted functions can intermix freely. The language used in Hart and Levin&#x27;s memo is much closer to modern Lisp style than McCarthy&#x27;s earlier code.

Garbage collection routines were developed by MIT graduate student Daniel Edwards, prior to 1962.

During the 1980s and 1990s, a great effort was made to unify the work on new Lisp dialects (mostly successors to Maclisp such as ZetaLisp and NIL (New Implementation of Lisp) into a single language. The new language, Common Lisp, was somewhat compatible with the dialects it replaced (the book &quot;Common Lisp the Language&quot; notes the compatibility of various constructs). In 1994, ANSI published the Common Lisp standard, &quot;ANSI X3.226-1994 Information Technology Programming Language Common Lisp&quot;.

=== Timeline ===
===Connection to artificial intelligence===
Since inception, Lisp was closely connected with the artificial intelligence research community, especially on PDP-10 systems. Lisp was used as the implementation of the language Micro Planner, which was used in the famous AI system SHRDLU. In the 1970s, as AI research spawned commercial offshoots, the performance of existing Lisp systems became a growing issue, as programmers needed to be familiar with the performance ramifications of the various techniques and choices involved in the implementation of Lisp.

===Genealogy and variants===
Over its sixty-year history, Lisp has spawned many variations on the core theme of an S-expression language. Some of these variations have been standardized and implemented by different groups with different priorities (for example, both Common Lisp and Scheme have multiple implementations). However, in other cases a software project defines a lisp without a standard and there is no clear distinction between the dialect and the implementation (for example, Clojure and Emacs Lisp fall into this category).

Differences between dialects (and/or implementations) may be quite visible—for instance, Common Lisp uses the keyword codice_1 to name a function, but Scheme uses codice_2. Within a dialect that is standardized conforming implementations support the same core language, but with different extensions and libraries. This sometimes also creates quite visible changes from the base language - for instance, Guile (an implementation of Scheme) uses codice_3 to create functions which can have default arguments and/or keyword arguments, neither of which are standardized.

====Historically significant dialects====
* LISP 1 – First implementation.
* LISP 1.5 – First widely distributed version, developed by McCarthy and others at MIT. So named because it contained several improvements on the original &quot;LISP 1&quot; interpreter, but was not a major restructuring as the planned LISP 2 would be.
* Stanford LISP 1.6 – A successor to LISP 1.5 developed at the Stanford AI Lab, and widely distributed to PDP-10 systems running the TOPS-10 operating system. It was rendered obsolete by Maclisp and InterLisp.
* Maclisp – developed for MIT&#x27;s Project MAC, MACLISP is a direct descendant of LISP 1.5. It ran on the PDP-10 and Multics systems. MACLISP would later come to be called Maclisp, and is often referred to as MacLisp. The &quot;MAC&quot; in MACLISP is unrelated to Apple&#x27;s Macintosh or McCarthy.
* Interlisp – developed at BBN Technologies for PDP-10 systems running the TENEX operating system, later adopted as a &quot;West coast&quot; Lisp for the Xerox Lisp machines as InterLisp-D. A small version called &quot;InterLISP 65&quot; was published for the MOS Technology 6502-based Atari 8-bit computers. Maclisp and InterLisp were strong competitors.
* Franz Lisp – originally a University of California, Berkeley project; later developed by Franz Inc. The name is a humorous deformation of the name &quot;Franz Liszt&quot;, and does not refer to Allegro Common Lisp, the dialect of Common Lisp sold by Franz Inc., in more recent years.
* XLISP, which AutoLISP was based on.
* Standard Lisp and Portable Standard Lisp were widely used and ported, especially with the Computer Algebra System REDUCE.
* ZetaLisp, also termed Lisp Machine Lisp – used on the Lisp machines, direct descendant of Maclisp. ZetaLisp had a big influence on Common Lisp.
* LeLisp is a French Lisp dialect. One of the first Interface Builders (called SOS Interface) was written in LeLisp.
* Scheme (1975).
* Common Lisp (1984), as described by &quot;Common Lisp the Language&quot; – a consolidation of several divergent attempts (ZetaLisp, Spice Lisp, NIL, and S-1 Lisp) to create successor dialects to Maclisp, with substantive influences from the Scheme dialect as well. This version of Common Lisp was available for wide-ranging platforms and was accepted by many as a de facto standard until the publication of ANSI Common Lisp (ANSI X3.226-1994). Among the most widespread sub-dialects of Common Lisp are Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL), CMU Common Lisp (CMU-CL), Clozure OpenMCL (not to be confused with Clojure!), GNU CLisp, and later versions of Franz Lisp; all of them adhere to the later ANSI CL standard (see below).
* Dylan was in its first version a mix of Scheme with the Common Lisp Object System.
* EuLisp – attempt to develop a new efficient and cleaned-up Lisp.
* ISLISP – attempt to develop a new efficient and cleaned-up Lisp. Standardized as ISO/IEC 13816:1997 and later revised as ISO/IEC 13816:2007: &quot;Information technology – Programming languages, their environments and system software interfaces – Programming language ISLISP&quot;.
* IEEE Scheme – IEEE standard, 1178–1990 (R1995).
* ANSI Common Lisp – an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for Common Lisp, created by subcommittee X3J13, chartered to begin with &quot;Common Lisp: The Language&quot; as a base document and to work through a public consensus process to find solutions to shared issues of portability of programs and compatibility of Common Lisp implementations. Although formally an ANSI standard, the implementation, sale, use, and influence of ANSI Common Lisp has been and continues to be seen worldwide.
* ACL2 or &quot;A Computational Logic for Applicative Common Lisp&quot;, an applicative (side-effect free) variant of Common LISP. ACL2 is both a programming language which can model computer systems, and a tool to help proving properties of those models.
* Clojure, a recent dialect of Lisp which compiles to the Java virtual machine and has a particular focus on concurrency.
* Game Oriented Assembly Lisp (or GOAL) is a video game programming language developed by Andy Gavin at Naughty Dog. It was written using Allegro Common Lisp and used in the development of the entire Jak and Daxter series of games developed by Naughty Dog.

===2000 to present===
After having declined somewhat in the 1990s, Lisp has experienced a resurgence of interest after 2000. Most new activity has been focused around implementations of Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Clojure, and Racket, and includes development of new portable libraries and applications.

Many new Lisp programmers were inspired by writers such as Paul Graham and Eric S. Raymond to pursue a language others considered antiquated. New Lisp programmers often describe the language as an eye-opening experience and claim to be substantially more productive than in other languages. This increase in awareness may be contrasted to the &quot;AI winter&quot; and Lisp&#x27;s brief gain in the mid-1990s.

, there were eleven actively maintained Common Lisp implementations.

The open source community has created new supporting infrastructure: CLiki is a wiki that collects Common Lisp related information, the Common Lisp directory lists resources, #lisp is a popular IRC channel and allows the sharing and commenting of code snippets (with support by lisppaste, an IRC bot written in Lisp), Planet Lisp collects the contents of various Lisp-related blogs, on LispForum users discuss Lisp topics, Lispjobs is a service for announcing job offers and there is a weekly news service, &quot;Weekly Lisp News&quot;. &quot;Common-lisp.net&quot; is a hosting site for open source Common Lisp projects. Quicklisp is a library manager for Common Lisp.

Fifty years of Lisp (1958–2008) was celebrated at LISP50@OOPSLA. There are regular local user meetings in Boston, Vancouver, and Hamburg. Other events include the European Common Lisp Meeting, the European Lisp Symposium and an International Lisp Conference.

The Scheme community actively maintains over twenty implementations. Several significant new implementations (Chicken, Gambit, Gauche, Ikarus, Larceny, Ypsilon) have been developed in the 2000s (decade). The Revised5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme standard of Scheme was widely accepted in the Scheme community. The Scheme Requests for Implementation process has created a lot of quasi-standard libraries and extensions for Scheme. User communities of individual Scheme implementations continue to grow. A new language standardization process was started in 2003 and led to the R6RS Scheme standard in 2007. Academic use of Scheme for teaching computer science seems to have declined somewhat. Some universities are no longer using Scheme in their computer science introductory courses; MIT now uses Python instead of Scheme for its undergraduate computer science program and MITx massive open online course.

There are several new dialects of Lisp: Arc, Hy, Nu, Liskell, and LFE (Lisp Flavored Erlang). The parser for Julia is implemented in Femtolisp, a dialect of Scheme (Julia is inspired by Scheme, which in turn is a Lisp dialect).

In October 2019, Paul Graham released a specification for Bel, &quot;a new dialect of Lisp.&quot;

==Major dialects==
Common Lisp and Scheme represent two major streams of Lisp development. These languages embody significantly different design choices.

Common Lisp is a successor to Maclisp. The primary influences were Lisp Machine Lisp, Maclisp, NIL, S-1 Lisp, Spice Lisp, and Scheme. It has many of the features of Lisp Machine Lisp (a large Lisp dialect used to program Lisp Machines), but was designed to be efficiently implementable on any personal computer or workstation. Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language and thus has a large language standard including many built-in data types, functions, macros and other language elements, and an object system (Common Lisp Object System). Common Lisp also borrowed certain features from Scheme such as lexical scoping and lexical closures. Common Lisp implementations are available for targeting different platforms such as the LLVM, the Java virtual machine,
x86-64, PowerPC, Alpha, ARM, Motorola 68000, and MIPS, and operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Dragonfly BSD, and Heroku.

Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy L. Steele, Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman. It was designed to have exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions. Designed about a decade earlier than Common Lisp, Scheme is a more minimalist design. It has a much smaller set of standard features but with certain implementation features (such as tail-call optimization and full continuations) not specified in Common Lisp. A wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and message passing styles, find convenient expression in Scheme. Scheme continues to evolve with a series of standards (Revisedn Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme) and a series of Scheme Requests for Implementation.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp that targets mainly the Java virtual machine, and the Common Language Runtime (CLR), the Python VM, the Ruby VM YARV, and compiling to JavaScript. It is designed to be a pragmatic general-purpose language. Clojure draws considerable influences from Haskell and places a very strong emphasis on immutability. Clojure provides access to Java frameworks and libraries, with optional type hints and type inference, so that calls to Java can avoid reflection and enable fast primitive operations. Clojure is not designed to be backwards compatible with other Lisp dialects.

Further, Lisp dialects are used as scripting languages in many applications, with the best-known being Emacs Lisp in the Emacs editor, AutoLISP and later Visual Lisp in AutoCAD, Nyquist in Audacity, and Scheme in LilyPond. The potential small size of a useful Scheme interpreter makes it particularly popular for embedded scripting. Examples include SIOD and TinyScheme, both of which have been successfully embedded in the GIMP image processor under the generic name &quot;Script-fu&quot;. LIBREP, a Lisp interpreter by John Harper originally based on the Emacs Lisp language, has been embedded in the Sawfish window manager.

===Standardized dialects===

Lisp has officially standardized dialects: R6RS Scheme, R7RS Scheme, IEEE Scheme, ANSI Common Lisp and ISO ISLISP.

==Language innovations==
Paul Graham identifies nine important aspects of Lisp that distinguished it from existing languages like Fortran:
* Conditionals not limited to goto
* First-class functions
* Recursion
* Treating variables uniformly as pointers, leaving types to values
* Garbage collection
* Programs made entirely of expressions with no statements
* The symbol data type, distinct from the string data type
* Notation for code made of trees of symbols (using many parentheses)
* Full language available at load time, compile time, and run time

Lisp was the first language where the structure of program code is represented faithfully and directly in a standard data structure—a quality much later dubbed &quot;homoiconicity&quot;. Thus, Lisp functions can be manipulated, altered or even created within a Lisp program without lower-level manipulations. This is generally considered one of the main advantages of the language with regard to its expressive power, and makes the language suitable for syntactic macros and meta-circular evaluation.

A conditional using an &quot;if–then–else&quot; syntax was invented by McCarthy for a chess program written in Fortran. He proposed its inclusion in ALGOL, but it was not made part of the Algol 58 specification. For Lisp, McCarthy used the more general &quot;cond&quot;-structure. Algol 60 took up &quot;if–then–else&quot; and popularized it.

Lisp deeply influenced Alan Kay, the leader of the research team that developed Smalltalk at Xerox PARC; and in turn Lisp was influenced by Smalltalk, with later dialects adopting object-oriented programming features (inheritance classes, encapsulating instances, message passing, etc.) in the 1970s. The Flavors object system introduced the concept of multiple inheritance and the mixin. The Common Lisp Object System provides multiple inheritance, multimethods with multiple dispatch, and first-class generic functions, yielding a flexible and powerful form of dynamic dispatch. It has served as the template for many subsequent Lisp (including Scheme) object systems, which are often implemented via a metaobject protocol, a reflective meta-circular design in which the object system is defined in terms of itself: Lisp was only the second language after Smalltalk (and is still one of the very few languages) to possess such a metaobject system. Many years later, Alan Kay suggested that as a result of the confluence of these features, only Smalltalk and Lisp could be regarded as properly conceived object-oriented programming systems.

Lisp introduced the concept of automatic garbage collection, in which the system walks the heap looking for unused memory. Progress in modern sophisticated garbage collection algorithms such as generational garbage collection was stimulated by its use in Lisp.

Edsger W. Dijkstra in his 1972 Turing Award lecture said,
Largely because of its resource requirements with respect to early computing hardware (including early microprocessors), Lisp did not become as popular outside of the AI community as Fortran and the ALGOL-descended C language. Because of its suitability to complex and dynamic applications, Lisp enjoyed some resurgence of popular interest in the 2010s.

==Syntax and semantics==
:&quot;This article&#x27;s examples are written in Common Lisp (though most are also valid in Scheme).&quot;

===Symbolic expressions (S-expressions)===
Lisp is an expression oriented language. Unlike most other languages, no distinction is made between &quot;expressions&quot; and &quot;statements&quot;; all code and data are written as expressions. When an expression is &quot;evaluated&quot;, it produces a value (possibly multiple values), which can then be embedded into other expressions. Each value can be any data type.

McCarthy&#x27;s 1958 paper introduced two types of syntax: &quot;Symbolic expressions&quot; (S-expressions, sexps), which mirror the internal representation of code and data; and &quot;Meta expressions&quot; (M-expressions), which express functions of S-expressions. M-expressions never found favor, and almost all Lisps today use S-expressions to manipulate both code and data.

The use of parentheses is Lisp&#x27;s most immediately obvious difference from other programming language families. As a result, students have long given Lisp nicknames such as &quot;Lost In Stupid Parentheses&quot;, or &quot;Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses&quot;. However, the S-expression syntax is also responsible for much of Lisp&#x27;s power: the syntax is simple and consistent, which facilitates manipulation by computer. However, the syntax of Lisp is not limited to traditional parentheses notation. It can be extended to include alternative notations. For example, XMLisp is a Common Lisp extension that employs the metaobject protocol to integrate S-expressions with the Extensible Markup Language (XML).

The reliance on expressions gives the language great flexibility. Because Lisp functions are written as lists, they can be processed exactly like data. This allows easy writing of programs which manipulate other programs (metaprogramming). Many Lisp dialects exploit this feature using macro systems, which enables extension of the language almost without limit.

===Lists===
A Lisp list is written with its elements separated by whitespace, and surrounded by parentheses. For example, is a list whose elements are the three &quot;atoms&quot; , , and . These values are implicitly typed: they are respectively two integers and a Lisp-specific data type called a &quot;symbol&quot;, and do not have to be declared as such.

The empty list is also represented as the special atom . This is the only entity in Lisp which is both an atom and a list.

Expressions are written as lists, using prefix notation. The first element in the list is the name of a function, the name of a macro, a lambda expression or the name of a &quot;special operator&quot; (see below). The remainder of the list are the arguments. For example, the function returns its arguments as a list, so the expression

 (list 1 2 (quote foo))

evaluates to the list . The &quot;quote&quot; before the in the preceding example is a &quot;special operator&quot; which returns its argument without evaluating it. Any unquoted expressions are recursively evaluated before the enclosing expression is evaluated. For example,

 (list 1 2 (list 3 4))

evaluates to the list . The third argument is a list; lists can be nested.

===Operators===
Arithmetic operators are treated similarly. The expression

 (+ 1 2 3 4)

evaluates to 10. The equivalent under infix notation would be &quot;&quot;.

Lisp has no notion of operators as implemented in ALGOL-derived languages. Arithmetic operators in Lisp are variadic functions (or &quot;n-ary&quot;), able to take any number of arguments. A C-style &#x27;++&#x27; increment operator is sometimes implemented under the name codice_4 giving syntax

 (incf x)

equivalent to codice_5, returning the new value of codice_6.

&quot;Special operators&quot; (sometimes called &quot;special forms&quot;) provide Lisp&#x27;s control structure. For example, the special operator takes three arguments. If the first argument is non-nil, it evaluates to the second argument; otherwise, it evaluates to the third argument. Thus, the expression

 (if nil
 (list 1 2 &quot;foo&quot;)
 (list 3 4 &quot;bar&quot;))

evaluates to . Of course, this would be more useful if a non-trivial expression had been substituted in place of .

Lisp also provides logical operators and, or and not. The and and or operators do short-circuit evaluation and will return their first nil and non-nil argument respectively.

 (or (and &quot;zero&quot; nil &quot;never&quot;) &quot;James&quot; &#x27;task &#x27;time)

will evaluate to &quot;James&quot;.

===Lambda expressions and function definition===
Another special operator, , is used to bind variables to values which are then evaluated within an expression. This operator is also used to create functions: the arguments to are a list of arguments, and the expression or expressions to which the function evaluates (the returned value is the value of the last expression that is evaluated). The expression

 (lambda (arg) (+ arg 1))

evaluates to a function that, when applied, takes one argument, binds it to and returns the number one greater than that argument. Lambda expressions are treated no differently from named functions; they are invoked the same way. Therefore, the expression

 ((lambda (arg) (+ arg 1)) 5)

evaluates to . Here, we&#x27;re doing a function application: we execute the anonymous function by passing to it the value 5.

Named functions are created by storing a lambda expression in a symbol using the defun macro.

 (defun foo (a b c d) (+ a b c d))
 defines a new function named in the global environment. It is conceptually similar to the expression:
 (setf (fdefinition &#x27;f) #&#x27;(lambda (a) (block f b...)))
where is a macro used to set the value of the first argument to a new function object. is a global function definition for the function named . is an abbreviation for special operator, returning a function object.

===Atoms===
In the original LISP there were two fundamental data types: atoms and lists. A list was a finite ordered sequence of elements, where each element is either an atom or a list, and an atom was a number or a symbol. A symbol was essentially a unique named item, written as an alphanumeric string in source code, and used either as a variable name or as a data item in symbolic processing. For example, the list contains three elements: the symbol , the list , and the number 2.

The essential difference between atoms and lists was that atoms were immutable and unique. Two atoms that appeared in different places in source code but were written in exactly the same way represented the same object, whereas each list was a separate object that could be altered independently of other lists and could be distinguished from other lists by comparison operators.

As more data types were introduced in later Lisp dialects, and programming styles evolved, the concept of an atom lost importance. Many dialects still retained the predicate &quot;atom&quot; for legacy compatibility, defining it true for any object which is not a cons.

===Conses and lists===
A Lisp list is implemented as a singly linked list. Each cell of this list is called a &quot;cons&quot; (in Scheme, a &quot;pair&quot;) and is composed of two pointers, called the &quot;car&quot; and &quot;cdr&quot;. These are respectively equivalent to the and fields discussed in the article &quot;linked list&quot;.

Of the many data structures that can be built out of cons cells, one of the most basic is called a &quot;proper list&quot;. A proper list is either the special (empty list) symbol, or a cons in which the points to a datum (which may be another cons structure, such as a list), and the points to another proper list.

If a given cons is taken to be the head of a linked list, then its car points to the first element of the list, and its cdr points to the rest of the list. For this reason, the and functions are also called and when referring to conses which are part of a linked list (rather than, say, a tree).

Thus, a Lisp list is not an atomic object, as an instance of a container class in C++ or Java would be. A list is nothing more than an aggregate of linked conses. A variable that refers to a given list is simply a pointer to the first cons in the list. Traversal of a list can be done by &quot;cdring down&quot; the list; that is, taking successive cdrs to visit each cons of the list; or by using any of several higher-order functions to map a function over a list.

Because conses and lists are so universal in Lisp systems, it is a common misconception that they are Lisp&#x27;s only data structures. In fact, all but the most simplistic Lisps have other data structures, such as vectors (arrays), hash tables, structures, and so forth.

====S-expressions represent lists====
Parenthesized S-expressions represent linked list structures. There are several ways to represent the same list as an S-expression. A cons can be written in &quot;dotted-pair notation&quot; as , where is the car and the cdr. A longer proper list might be written in dotted-pair notation. This is conventionally abbreviated as in &quot;list notation&quot;. An improper list may be written in a combination of the two – as for the list of three conses whose last cdr is (i.e., the list in fully specified form).

====List-processing procedures====
Lisp provides many built-in procedures for accessing and controlling lists. Lists can be created directly with the procedure, which takes any number of arguments, and returns the list of these arguments.

 (list 1 2 &#x27;a 3)
 ;Output: (1 2 a 3)
 (list 1 &#x27;(2 3) 4)
 ;Output: (1 (2 3) 4)

Because of the way that lists are constructed from cons pairs, the procedure can be used to add an element to the front of a list. The procedure is asymmetric in how it handles list arguments, because of how lists are constructed.

 (cons 1 &#x27;(2 3))
 ;Output: (1 2 3)
 (cons &#x27;(1 2) &#x27;(3 4))
 ;Output: ((1 2) 3 4)

The procedure appends two (or more) lists to one another. Because Lisp lists are linked lists, appending two lists has asymptotic time complexity formula_1

 (append &#x27;(1 2) &#x27;(3 4))
 ;Output: (1 2 3 4)
 (append &#x27;(1 2 3) &#x27;() &#x27;(a) &#x27;(5 6))
 ;Output: (1 2 3 a 5 6)
====Shared structure====
Lisp lists, being simple linked lists, can share structure with one another. That is to say, two lists can have the same &quot;tail&quot;, or final sequence of conses. For instance, after the execution of the following Common Lisp code:

(setf foo (list &#x27;a &#x27;b &#x27;c))
(setf bar (cons &#x27;x (cdr foo)))

the lists and are and respectively. However, the tail is the same structure in both lists. It is not a copy; the cons cells pointing to and are in the same memory locations for both lists.

Sharing structure rather than copying can give a dramatic performance improvement. However, this technique can interact in undesired ways with functions that alter lists passed to them as arguments. Altering one list, such as by replacing the with a , will affect the other:

 (setf (third foo) &#x27;goose)

This changes to , but thereby also changes to – a possibly unexpected result. This can be a source of bugs, and functions which alter their arguments are documented as &quot;destructive&quot; for this very reason.

Aficionados of functional programming avoid destructive functions. In the Scheme dialect, which favors the functional style, the names of destructive functions are marked with a cautionary exclamation point, or &quot;bang&quot;—such as (read &quot;set car bang&quot;), which replaces the car of a cons. In the Common Lisp dialect, destructive functions are commonplace; the equivalent of is named for &quot;replace car&quot;. This function is rarely seen, however, as Common Lisp includes a special facility, , to make it easier to define and use destructive functions. A frequent style in Common Lisp is to write code functionally (without destructive calls) when prototyping, then to add destructive calls as an optimization where it is safe to do so.

===Self-evaluating forms and quoting===
Lisp evaluates expressions which are entered by the user. Symbols and lists evaluate to some other (usually, simpler) expression – for instance, a symbol evaluates to the value of the variable it names; evaluates to . However, most other forms evaluate to themselves: if entering into Lisp, it returns .

Any expression can also be marked to prevent it from being evaluated (as is necessary for symbols and lists). This is the role of the special operator, or its abbreviation (one quotation mark). For instance, usually if entering the symbol , it returns the value of the corresponding variable (or an error, if there is no such variable). To refer to the literal symbol, enter or, usually, .

Both Common Lisp and Scheme also support the &quot;backquote&quot; operator (termed &quot;quasiquote&quot; in Scheme), entered with the character (Backtick). This is almost the same as the plain quote, except it allows expressions to be evaluated and their values interpolated into a quoted list with the comma &quot;unquote&quot; and comma-at &quot;splice&quot; operators. If the variable has the value then evaluates to , while evaluates to . The backquote is most often used in defining macro expansions.

Self-evaluating forms and quoted forms are Lisp&#x27;s equivalent of literals. It may be possible to modify the values of (mutable) literals in program code. For instance, if a function returns a quoted form, and the code that calls the function modifies the form, this may alter the behavior of the function on subsequent invocations.
(defun should-be-constant ()
 &#x27;(one two three))

(let ((stuff (should-be-constant)))
 (setf (third stuff) &#x27;bizarre)) ; bad!

(should-be-constant) ; returns (one two bizarre)
Modifying a quoted form like this is generally considered bad style, and is defined by ANSI Common Lisp as erroneous (resulting in &quot;undefined&quot; behavior in compiled files, because the file-compiler can coalesce similar constants, put them in write-protected memory, etc.).

Lisp&#x27;s formalization of quotation has been noted by Douglas Hofstadter (in &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;) and others as an example of the philosophical idea of self-reference.

===Scope and closure===
The Lisp family splits over the use of dynamic or static (a.k.a. lexical) scope. Clojure, Common Lisp and Scheme make use of static scoping by default, while newLISP, Picolisp and the embedded languages in Emacs and AutoCAD use dynamic scoping. Since version 24.1, Emacs uses both dynamic and lexical scoping.

===List structure of program code; exploitation by macros and compilers===
A fundamental distinction between Lisp and other languages is that in Lisp, the textual representation of a program is simply a human-readable description of the same internal data structures (linked lists, symbols, number, characters, etc.) as would be used by the underlying Lisp system.

Lisp uses this to implement a very powerful macro system. Like other macro languages such as the one defined by the C preprocessor (the macro preprocessor for the C, Objective-C and C++ programming languages), a macro returns code that can then be compiled. However, unlike C preprocessor macros, the macros are Lisp functions and so can exploit the full power of Lisp.

Further, because Lisp code has the same structure as lists, macros can be built with any of the list-processing functions in the language. In short, anything that Lisp can do to a data structure, Lisp macros can do to code. In contrast, in most other languages, the parser&#x27;s output is purely internal to the language implementation and cannot be manipulated by the programmer.

This feature makes it easy to develop &quot;efficient&quot; languages within languages. For example, the Common Lisp Object System can be implemented cleanly as a language extension using macros. This means that if an application needs a different inheritance mechanism, it can use a different object system. This is in stark contrast to most other languages; for example, Java does not support multiple inheritance and there is no reasonable way to add it.

In simplistic Lisp implementations, this list structure is directly interpreted to run the program; a function is literally a piece of list structure which is traversed by the interpreter in executing it. However, most substantial Lisp systems also include a compiler. The compiler translates list structure into machine code or bytecode for execution. This code can run as fast as code compiled in conventional languages such as C.

Macros expand before the compilation step, and thus offer some interesting options. If a program needs a precomputed table, then a macro might create the table at compile time, so the compiler need only output the table and need not call code to create the table at run time. Some Lisp implementations even have a mechanism, codice_7, that allows code to be present during compile time (when a macro would need it), but not present in the emitted module.

===Evaluation and the read–eval–print loop===
Lisp languages are often used with an interactive command line, which may be combined with an integrated development environment (IDE). The user types in expressions at the command line, or directs the IDE to transmit them to the Lisp system. Lisp &quot;reads&quot; the entered expressions, &quot;evaluates&quot; them, and &quot;prints&quot; the result. For this reason, the Lisp command line is called a &quot;read–eval–print loop&quot; (REPL).

The basic operation of the REPL is as follows. This is a simplistic description which omits many elements of a real Lisp, such as quoting and macros.

The function accepts textual S-expressions as input, and parses them into an internal data structure. For instance, if you type the text at the prompt, translates this into a linked list with three elements: the symbol , the number 1, and the number 2. It so happens that this list is also a valid piece of Lisp code; that is, it can be evaluated. This is because the car of the list names a function—the addition operation.

A will be read as a single symbol. will be read as the number one hundred and twenty-three. will be read as the string &quot;123&quot;.

The function evaluates the data, returning zero or more other Lisp data as a result. Evaluation does not have to mean interpretation; some Lisp systems compile every expression to native machine code. It is simple, however, to describe evaluation as interpretation: To evaluate a list whose car names a function, first evaluates each of the arguments given in its cdr, then applies the function to the arguments. In this case, the function is addition, and applying it to the argument list yields the answer . This is the result of the evaluation.

The symbol evaluates to the value of the symbol foo. Data like the string &quot;123&quot; evaluates to the same string. The list evaluates to the list (1 2 3).

It is the job of the function to represent output to the user. For a simple result such as this is trivial. An expression which evaluated to a piece of list structure would require that traverse the list and print it out as an S-expression.

To implement a Lisp REPL, it is necessary only to implement these three functions and an infinite-loop function. (Naturally, the implementation of will be complex, since it must also implement all special operators like or .) This done, a basic REPL is one line of code: .

The Lisp REPL typically also provides input editing, an input history, error handling and an interface to the debugger.

Lisp is usually evaluated eagerly. In Common Lisp, arguments are evaluated in applicative order (&#x27;leftmost innermost&#x27;), while in Scheme order of arguments is undefined, leaving room for optimization by a compiler.

===Control structures===
Lisp originally had very few control structures, but many more were added during the language&#x27;s evolution. (Lisp&#x27;s original conditional operator, , is the precursor to later structures.)

Programmers in the Scheme dialect often express loops using tail recursion. Scheme&#x27;s commonality in academic computer science has led some students to believe that tail recursion is the only, or the most common, way to write iterations in Lisp, but this is incorrect. All oft-seen Lisp dialects have imperative-style iteration constructs, from Scheme&#x27;s loop to Common Lisp&#x27;s complex expressions. Moreover, the key issue that makes this an objective rather than subjective matter is that Scheme makes specific requirements for the handling of tail calls, and thus the reason that the use of tail recursion is generally encouraged for Scheme is that the practice is expressly supported by the language definition. By contrast, ANSI Common Lisp does not require the optimization commonly termed a tail call elimination. Thus, the fact that tail recursive style as a casual replacement for the use of more traditional iteration constructs (such as , or ) is discouraged in Common Lisp is not just a matter of stylistic preference, but potentially one of efficiency (since an apparent tail call in Common Lisp may not compile as a simple jump) and program correctness (since tail recursion may increase stack use in Common Lisp, risking stack overflow).

Some Lisp control structures are &quot;special operators&quot;, equivalent to other languages&#x27; syntactic keywords. Expressions using these operators have the same surface appearance as function calls, but differ in that the arguments are not necessarily evaluated—or, in the case of an iteration expression, may be evaluated more than once.

In contrast to most other major programming languages, Lisp allows implementing control structures using the language. Several control structures are implemented as Lisp macros, and can even be macro-expanded by the programmer who wants to know how they work.

Both Common Lisp and Scheme have operators for non-local control flow. The differences in these operators are some of the deepest differences between the two dialects. Scheme supports &quot;re-entrant continuations&quot; using the procedure, which allows a program to save (and later restore) a particular place in execution. Common Lisp does not support re-entrant continuations, but does support several ways of handling escape continuations.

Often, the same algorithm can be expressed in Lisp in either an imperative or a functional style. As noted above, Scheme tends to favor the functional style, using tail recursion and continuations to express control flow. However, imperative style is still quite possible. The style preferred by many Common Lisp programmers may seem more familiar to programmers used to structured languages such as C, while that preferred by Schemers more closely resembles pure-functional languages such as Haskell.

Because of Lisp&#x27;s early heritage in list processing, it has a wide array of higher-order functions relating to iteration over sequences. In many cases where an explicit loop would be needed in other languages (like a loop in C) in Lisp the same task can be accomplished with a higher-order function. (The same is true of many functional programming languages.)

A good example is a function which in Scheme is called and in Common Lisp is called . Given a function and one or more lists, applies the function successively to the lists&#x27; elements in order, collecting the results in a new list:

 (mapcar #&#x27;+ &#x27;(1 2 3 4 5) &#x27;(10 20 30 40 50))

This applies the function to each corresponding pair of list elements, yielding the result .

== Examples ==

Here are examples of Common Lisp code.

The basic &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:

(print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
Lisp syntax lends itself naturally to recursion. Mathematical problems such as the enumeration of recursively defined sets are simple to express in this notation. For example, to evaluate a number&#x27;s factorial:

(defun factorial (n)
 (if (zerop n) 1
 (* n (factorial (1- n)))))
An alternative implementation takes less stack space than the previous version if the underlying Lisp system optimizes tail recursion:

(defun factorial (n &amp;optional (acc 1))
 (if (zerop n) acc
 (factorial (1- n) (* acc n))))
Contrast the examples above with an iterative version which uses Common Lisp&#x27;s macro:

(defun factorial (n)
 (loop for i from 1 to n
 for fac = 1 then (* fac i)
 finally (return fac)))
The following function reverses a list. (Lisp&#x27;s built-in &quot;reverse&quot; function does the same thing.)

(defun -reverse (list)
 (let ((return-value))
 (dolist (e list) (push e return-value))
 return-value))
==Object systems==
Various object systems and models have been built on top of, alongside, or into Lisp, including
* The Common Lisp Object System, CLOS, is an integral part of ANSI Common Lisp. CLOS descended from New Flavors and CommonLOOPS. ANSI Common Lisp was the first standardized object-oriented programming language (1994, ANSI X3J13).
* ObjectLisp or Object Lisp, used by Lisp Machines Incorporated and early versions of Macintosh Common Lisp
* LOOPS (Lisp Object-Oriented Programming System) and the later CommonLoops
* Flavors, built at MIT, and its descendant New Flavors (developed by Symbolics).
* KR (short for Knowledge Representation), a constraints-based object system developed to aid the writing of Garnet, a GUI library for Common Lisp.
* Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) used an object system named UNITS and integrated it with an inference engine and a truth maintenance system (ATMS).

==Operating systems==
Several operating systems, including language-based systems, are based on Lisp (use Lisp features, conventions, methods, data structures, etc.), or are written in Lisp, including:

Genera, renamed Open Genera, by Symbolics; Medley, written in Interlisp, originally a family of graphical operating systems that ran on Xerox&#x27;s later Star workstations; Mezzano; Interim; ChrysaLisp, by developers of Tao Systems&#x27; TAOS; and also the Guix System for GNU/Linux.

<text>In mathematics, many [[logarithm]]ic [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] exist. The following is a compilation of the notable of these, many of which are used for computational purposes.

== Trivial identities ==

&quot;Trivial&quot; mathematical identities are relatively simple (for an experienced mathematician), though not necessarily unimportant. The trivial logarithmic identities are as follows:

=== Explanations ===
By definition, we know that:
:formula_1,
where formula_2 and formula_3.
Setting formula_4,
we can see that: 
formula_5. So, substituting these values into the formula, we see that:
formula_6
, which gets us the first property.
Setting formula_7,
we can see that: 
formula_8. So, substituting these values into the formula, we see that:
formula_9
, which gets us the second property.

== Cancelling exponentials ==
Logarithms and exponentials with the same base cancel each other. This is true because logarithms and exponentials are inverse operations—much like the same way multiplication and division are inverse operations, and addition and subtraction are inverse operations.

:formula_10

:formula_11

Both of the above are derived from the following two equations that define a logarithm:
(note that in this explanation, the variables of formula_12 and formula_13 may not be referring to the same number)

:formula_14

Looking at the equation formula_15, and substituting the value for formula_13 of
formula_17, we get the following equation: 
formula_18
, which gets us the first equation.
Another more rough way to think about it is that formula_19,
and that that &quot;formula_20&quot; is formula_21.

Looking at the equation formula_22
, and substituting the value for formula_23 of formula_24, we get the following equation:
formula_25
, which gets us the second equation.
Another more rough way to think about it is that formula_26,
and that that something &quot;formula_20&quot; is formula_28.
== Using simpler operations ==

Logarithms can be used to make calculations easier. For example, two numbers can be multiplied just by using a logarithm table and adding. These are often known as logarithmic properties, which are documented in the table below. The first three operations below assume that and/or , so that and . Derivations also use the log definitions and .

Where formula_29, formula_13, and formula_31 are positive real numbers and formula_32, and formula_33 and formula_34 are real numbers.

The laws result from canceling exponentials and the appropriate law of indices. Starting with the first law:

:formula_35

The law for powers exploits another of the laws of indices:

:formula_36

The law relating to quotients then follows:

:formula_37

:formula_38

Similarly, the root law is derived by rewriting the root as a reciprocal power:

:formula_39

=== Derivations of product, quotient, and power rules ===

These are the three main logarithm laws/rules/principles, from which the other properties listed above can be proven. Each of these logarithm properties correspond to their respective exponent law, and their derivations/proofs will hinge on those facts. There are multiple ways to derive/prove each logarithm law – this is just one possible method.

==== Logarithm of a product ====

To state the &quot;logarithm of a product&quot; law formally:

:formula_40

Derivation:

Let formula_41, where formula_3,
and let formula_43. We want to relate the expressions formula_44 and formula_45. This can be done more easily by rewriting in terms of exponentials, whose properties we already know. Additionally, since we are going to refer to formula_44 and formula_45 quite often, we will give them some variable names to make working with them easier: Let formula_48, and let formula_49.

Rewriting these as exponentials, we see that

:formula_50

From here, we can relate formula_51 (i.e. formula_13) and formula_53 (i.e. formula_31) using exponent laws as

:formula_55

To recover the logarithms, we apply formula_56 to both sides of the equality.

:formula_57

The right side may be simplified using one of the logarithm properties from before: we know that formula_58, giving

:formula_59

We now resubstitute the values for formula_60 and formula_61 into our equation, so our final expression is only in terms of formula_13, formula_31, and formula_29.

:formula_65

This completes the derivation.

==== Logarithm of a quotient ====

To state the &quot;logarithm of a quotient&quot; law formally:

:formula_66

Derivation:

Let formula_41, where formula_3,
and let formula_43.

We want to relate the expressions formula_44 and formula_45. This can be done more easily by rewriting in terms of exponentials, whose properties we already know. Additionally, since we are going to refer to formula_44 and formula_45 quite often, we will give them some variable names to make working with them easier: Let formula_48, and let formula_49.

Rewriting these as exponentials, we see that:
:formula_50

From here, we can relate formula_51 (i.e. formula_13) and formula_53 (i.e. formula_31) using exponent laws as

:formula_81

To recover the logarithms, we apply formula_56 to both sides of the equality.

:formula_83

The right side may be simplified using one of the logarithm properties from before: we know that formula_84, giving

:formula_85

We now resubstitute the values for formula_60 and formula_61 into our equation, so our final expression is only in terms of formula_13, formula_31, and formula_29.

:formula_91

This completes the derivation.

==== Logarithm of a power ====

To state the &quot;logarithm of a power&quot; law formally:

:formula_92

Derivation:

Let formula_41, where formula_3, let formula_95, and let formula_96. For this derivation, we want to simplify the expression formula_97. To do this, we begin with the simpler expression formula_44. Since we will be using formula_44 often, we will define it as a new variable: Let formula_48.

To more easily manipulate the expression, we rewrite it as an exponential. By definition, formula_101, so we have

:formula_102

Similar to the derivations above, we take advantage of another exponent law. In order to have formula_103 in our final expression, we raise both sides of the equality to the power of formula_104:

:formula_105

where we used the exponent law formula_106.

To recover the logarithms, we apply formula_56 to both sides of the equality.

:formula_108

The left side of the equality can be simplified using a logarithm law, which states that formula_109.

:formula_110

Substituting in the original value for formula_60, rearranging, and simplifying gives

:formula_112

This completes the derivation.

== Changing the base ==

To state the change of base logarithm formula formally:
formula_113

This identity is useful to evaluate logarithms on calculators. For instance, most calculators have buttons for ln and for log10, but not all calculators have buttons for the logarithm of an arbitrary base.

=== Proof/derivation ===

Let formula_114, where formula_115 Let formula_116. Here, formula_117 and formula_29 are the two bases we will be using for the logarithms. They cannot be 1, because the logarithm function is not well defined for the base of 1. The number formula_13 will be what the logarithm is evaluating, so it must be a positive number. Since we will be dealing with the term formula_44 quite frequently, we define it as a new variable: Let formula_48.

To more easily manipulate the expression, it can be rewritten as an exponential.
formula_122

Applying formula_123 to both sides of the equality,
formula_124

Now, using the logarithm of a power property, which states that formula_125,
formula_126

Isolating formula_60, we get the following:
formula_128

Resubstituting formula_48 back into the equation,
formula_130

This completes the proof that formula_131.

This formula has several consequences:

formula_132

formula_133

formula_134

formula_135

formula_136

formula_137

where formula_138 is any permutation of the subscripts . For example
formula_139

=== Summation/subtraction ===
The following summation/subtraction rule is especially useful in probability theory when one is dealing with a sum of log-probabilities:

Note that the subtraction identity is not defined if formula_140, since the logarithm of zero is not defined. Also note that, when programming, formula_117 and formula_33 may have to be switched on the right hand side of the equations if formula_143 to avoid losing the &quot;1 +&quot; due to rounding errors. Many programming languages have a specific codice_1 function that calculates formula_144 without underflow (when formula_13 is small).

More generally:
formula_146

=== Exponents ===
A useful identity involving exponents:
formula_147
or more universally:
formula_148

=== Other/resulting identities ===
formula_149
formula_150

== Inequalities ==
Based on,

:formula_151

:formula_152

All are accurate around formula_153, but not for large numbers.

== Tropical identities ==
The following identity relates log semiring to the min-plus semiring.formula_154

== Calculus identities ==

=== Limits ===
:formula_155

:formula_156

:formula_157

:formula_158

:formula_159

:formula_160

The last limit is often summarized as &quot;logarithms grow more slowly than any power or root of &quot;x&quot;&quot;.

=== Derivatives of logarithmic functions ===
:formula_161
:formula_162
:formula_163

=== Integral definition ===
:formula_164

To modify the limits of integration to run from formula_13 to formula_166, we change the order of integration, which changes the sign of the integral:
:formula_167

Therefore:
:formula_168

=== Riemann Sum ===

:formula_169
:formula_170
:formula_171
:formula_172
:formula_173

for formula_174 and formula_175 is a sample point in each interval.

=== Series representation ===

The natural logarithm formula_176 has a well-known Taylor series expansion that converges for formula_13 in the open-closed interval :

formula_178

Within this interval, for formula_7, the series is conditionally convergent, and for all other values, it is absolutely convergent. For formula_180 or formula_181, the series does not converge to formula_176. In these cases, different representations or methods must be used to evaluate the logarithm.

=== Harmonic number difference ===

It is not uncommon in advanced mathematics, particularly in analytic number theory and asymptotic analysis, to encounter expressions involving differences or ratios of harmonic numbers at scaled indices. The identity involving the limiting difference between harmonic numbers at scaled indices and its relationship to the logarithmic function provides an intriguing example of how discrete sequences can asymptotically relate to continuous functions. This identity is expressed as

:formula_183

which characterizes the behavior of harmonic numbers as they grow large. This approximation (which precisely equals formula_184 in the limit) reflects how summation over increasing segments of the harmonic series exhibits integral properties, giving insight into the interplay between discrete and continuous analysis. It also illustrates how understanding the behavior of sums and series at large scales can lead to insightful conclusions about their properties. Here formula_185 denotes the formula_186-th harmonic number, defined as

:formula_187

The harmonic numbers are a fundamental sequence in number theory and analysis, known for their logarithmic growth. This result leverages the fact that the sum of the inverses of integers (i.e., harmonic numbers) can be closely approximated by the natural logarithm function, plus a constant, especially when extended over large intervals. As formula_186 tends towards infinity, the difference between the harmonic numbers formula_189 and formula_185 converges to a non-zero value. This persistent non-zero difference, formula_184, precludes the possibility of the harmonic series approaching a finite limit, thus providing a clear mathematical articulation of its divergence. The technique of approximating sums by integrals (specifically using the integral test or by direct integral approximation) is fundamental in deriving such results. This specific identity can be a consequence of these approximations, considering:

:formula_192

==== Harmonic limit derivation ====

The limit explores the growth of the harmonic numbers when indices are multiplied by a scaling factor and then differenced. It specifically captures the sum from formula_193 to formula_194:

:formula_195

This can be estimated using the integral test for convergence, or more directly by comparing it to the integral of formula_196 from formula_186 to formula_194:

:formula_199

As the window&#x27;s lower bound begins at formula_193 and the upper bound extends to formula_194, both of which tend toward infinity as formula_202, the summation window encompasses an increasingly vast portion of the smallest possible terms of the harmonic series (those with astronomically large denominators), creating a discrete sum that stretches towards infinity, which mirrors how continuous integrals accumulate value across an infinitesimally fine partitioning of the domain. In the limit, the interval is effectively from formula_166 to formula_204 where the onset formula_186 implies this minimally discrete region.

=== Double series formula ===
The harmonic number difference formula for formula_206 is an extension of the classic, alternating identity of formula_207:

:formula_208

which can be generalized as the double series over the residues of formula_60:

:formula_210

where formula_211 is the principle ideal generated by formula_60. Subtracting formula_213 from each term formula_214 (i.e., balancing each term with the modulus) reduces the magnitude of each term&#x27;s contribution, ensuring convergence by controlling the series&#x27; tendency toward divergence as formula_60 increases. For example:

:formula_216

This method leverages the fine differences between closely related terms to stabilize the series. The sum over all residues formula_217 ensures that adjustments are uniformly applied across all possible offsets within each block of formula_60 terms. This uniform distribution of the &quot;correction&quot; across different intervals defined by formula_219 functions similarly to telescoping over a very large sequence. It helps to flatten out the discrepancies that might otherwise lead to divergent behavior in a straightforward harmonic series. Note that the structure of the summands of this formula matches those of the interpolated harmonic number formula_220 when both the domain and range are negated (i.e., formula_221). However, the interpretation and roles of the variables differ.

==== Deveci&#x27;s Proof ====
A fundamental feature of the proof is the accumulation of the subtrahends formula_222 into a unit fraction, that is, formula_223 for formula_224, thus formula_225 rather than formula_226, where the extrema of formula_227 are formula_228 if formula_229 and formula_230 otherwise, with the minimum of formula_231 being implicit in the latter case due to the structural requirements of the proof. Since the cardinality of formula_227 depends on the selection of one of two possible minima, the integral formula_233, as a set-theoretic procedure, is a function of the maximum formula_234 (which remains consistent across both interpretations) plus formula_166, not the cardinality (which is ambiguous due to varying definitions of the minimum). Whereas the harmonic number difference computes the integral in a global sliding window, the double series, in parallel, computes the sum in a local sliding window—a shifting formula_60-tuple—over the harmonic series, advancing the window by formula_60 positions to select the next formula_60-tuple, and offsetting each element of each tuple by formula_239 relative to the window&#x27;s absolute position. The sum formula_240 corresponds to formula_241 which scales formula_242 without bound. The sum formula_243 corresponds to the prefix formula_244 trimmed from the series to establish the window&#x27;s moving lower bound formula_193, and formula_206 is the limit of the sliding window (the scaled, truncated series):

formula_247
formula_248

=== Integrals of logarithmic functions ===
:formula_249
:formula_250

To remember higher integrals, it is convenient to define
:formula_251
where formula_252 is the &quot;n&quot;th harmonic number:

:formula_253
:formula_254
:formula_255
:formula_256

Then
:formula_257
:formula_258

== Approximating large numbers ==

The identities of logarithms can be used to approximate large numbers. Note that , where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are arbitrary constants. Suppose that one wants to approximate the 44th Mersenne prime, . To get the base-10 logarithm, we would multiply 32,582,657 by , getting . We can then get .

Similarly, factorials can be approximated by summing the logarithms of the terms.

== Complex logarithm identities ==

The complex logarithm is the complex number analogue of the logarithm function. No single valued function on the complex plane can satisfy the normal rules for logarithms. However, a multivalued function can be defined which satisfies most of the identities. It is usual to consider this as a function defined on a Riemann surface. A single valued version, called the principal value of the logarithm, can be defined which is discontinuous on the negative x axis, and is equal to the multivalued version on a single branch cut.

=== Definitions ===

In what follows, a capital first letter is used for the principal value of functions, and the lower case version is used for the multivalued function. The single valued version of definitions and identities is always given first, followed by a separate section for the multiple valued versions.

* is the standard natural logarithm of the real number .
* is the principal value of the arg function; its value is restricted to . It can be computed using .
* is the principal value of the complex logarithm function and has imaginary part in the range .
*formula_259
*formula_260

The multiple valued version of is a set, but it is easier to write it without braces and using it in formulas follows obvious rules.

* is the set of complex numbers &quot;v&quot; which satisfy 
* is the set of possible values of the arg function applied to &quot;z&quot;.

Principal value form:

Multiple value forms:

:formula_276

Where , are any integers:

:formula_277
:formula_278

== Asymptotic identities ==
=== Pronic numbers ===
As a consequence of the harmonic number difference, the natural logarithm is asymptotically approximated by a finite series difference, representing a truncation of the integral at formula_279:

:formula_280

where formula_281 is the th triangular number, and formula_282 is the sum of the first even integers. Since the th pronic number is asymptotically equivalent to the th perfect square, it follows that:

:formula_280
=== Prime number theorem ===
The prime number theorem provides the following asymptotic equivalence:

:formula_284

where formula_285 is the prime counting function. This relationship is equal to:

:formula_286

where formula_287 is the harmonic mean of formula_288. This is derived from the fact that the difference between the formula_61th harmonic number and formula_290 asymptotically approaches a small constant, resulting in formula_291. This behavior can also be derived from the properties of logarithms: formula_290 is half of formula_293, and this &quot;first half&quot; is the natural log of the root of formula_294, which corresponds roughly to the first formula_295th of the sum formula_296, or formula_252. The asymptotic equivalence of the first formula_295th of formula_296 to the latter formula_300th of the series is expressed as follows:

:formula_301

which generalizes to:

:formula_302

:formula_303

and:

:formula_304
:formula_305
:formula_306

for fixed formula_186. The correspondence sets formula_252 as a unit magnitude that partitions formula_309 across powers, where each interval formula_295 to formula_311, formula_311 to formula_313, etc., corresponds to one formula_252 unit, illustrating that formula_309 forms a divergent series as formula_202.

=== Real Arguments ===
These approximations extend to the real-valued domain through the interpolated harmonic number. For example, where formula_317:
:formula_318

=== Stirling numbers ===
The natural logarithm is asymptotically related to the harmonic numbers by the Stirling numbers and the Gregory coefficients. By representing formula_252 in terms of Stirling numbers of the first kind, the harmonic number difference is alternatively expressed as follows, for fixed formula_186:

:formula_321

<text>A lost city is an urban settlement that fell into terminal decline and became extensively or completely uninhabited, with the consequence that the site&#x27;s former significance was no longer known to the wider world. The locations of many lost cities have been forgotten, but some have been rediscovered and studied extensively by scientists. Recently abandoned cities or cities whose location was never in question might be referred to as ruins or ghost towns. Smaller settlements may be referred to as abandoned villages. The search for such lost cities by European explorers and adventurers in Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia from the 15th century onward eventually led to the development of archaeology.

Lost cities generally fall into two broad categories: those where all knowledge of the city&#x27;s existence was forgotten before it was rediscovered, and those whose memory was preserved in myth, legend, or historical records but whose location was lost or at least no longer widely recognized.

== How cities are lost ==
Cities may become lost for a variety of reasons including natural disasters, economic or social upheaval, or war.

The Incan capital city of Vilcabamba was destroyed and depopulated during the Spanish conquest of Peru in 1572. The Spanish did not rebuild the city, and the location went unrecorded and was forgotten until it was rediscovered through a detailed examination of period letters and documents.

Troy was a city located in northwest Anatolia in what is now Turkey. It is best known for being the focus of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle and especially in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, the city slowly declined and was abandoned in the Byzantine era. Buried by time, the city was consigned to the realm of legend until the location was first excavated in the 1860s.

Other settlements are lost with few or no clues to their abandonment. For example, Malden Island, in the central Pacific, was deserted when first visited by Europeans in 1825, but the remains of temples and other structures on the island indicate that a population of Polynesians had lived there for perhaps several generations in the past. Typically this lack of information is due to a lack of surviving written or oral histories and a lack of archaeological data as in the case of the remote and fairly unknown Malden Island.

== Rediscovery ==
With the development of archaeology and the application of modern techniques, many previously lost cities have been rediscovered.

Machu Picchu is a pre-Columbian Inca site situated on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba Valley in Peru. Often referred to as the &quot;Lost City of the Incas&quot;, it is perhaps the most familiar icon of the Inca World. Machu Picchu was built around 1450, at the height of the Inca Empire. It was abandoned just over 100 years later, in 1572, as a belated result of the Spanish Conquest. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area. In 1911, Melchor Arteaga led the explorer Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu, which had been largely forgotten by everybody except the small number of people living in the immediate valley. Nevertheless, Peruvian explorer and farmer Agustín Lizárraga predated this discovery by 9 years, having found the Inca site on July 14, 1902. He left a charcoal inscription bearing the words &quot;A. Lizárraga 1902&quot;.

Helike was an ancient Greek city that sank at night in the winter of 373 BCE. The city was located in Achaea, Northern Peloponnesos, two kilometres (12 stadia) from the Corinthian Gulf. The city was thought to be legend until 2001, when it was rediscovered in the Helike Delta. In 1988, the Greek archaeologist Dora Katsonopoulou launched the Helike Project to locate the site of the lost city. In 1994, in collaboration with the University of Patras, a magnetometer survey was carried out in the midplain of the delta, which revealed the outlines of a buried building. In 1995, this target was excavated (now known as the Klonis site), and a large Roman building with standing walls was brought to light.

<text>Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz ( ; ) FRS (For) FRSE (May 28, 1807 – December 14, 1873) was a Swiss-born American biologist and geologist who is recognized as a scholar of Earth&#x27;s natural history.

Spending his early life in Switzerland, he received a PhD at Erlangen and a medical degree in Munich. After studying with Georges Cuvier and Alexander von Humboldt in Paris, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuchâtel. He emigrated to the United States in 1847 after visiting Harvard University. He went on to become professor of zoology and geology at Harvard, to head its Lawrence Scientific School, and to found its Museum of Comparative Zoology.

Agassiz is known for observational data gathering and analysis. He made institutional and scientific contributions to zoology, geology, and related areas, including multivolume research books running to thousands of pages. He is particularly known for his contributions to ichthyological classification, including of extinct species such as megalodon, and to the study of historical geology, including the founding of glaciology.

His theories on human, animal and plant polygenism have been criticised as implicitly supporting scientific racism.

==Early life==

Louis Agassiz was born in the village of Môtier (&quot;fr&quot;) (now part of Haut-Vully which merged into Mont-Vully in 2016) in the Swiss Canton of Fribourg. He was the son of a pastor, Louis Rudolphe and his wife, Rose Mayor.

His father was a Protestant clergyman, as had been his progenitors for six generations, and his mother was the daughter of a physician and an intellectual in her own right, who had assisted her husband in the education of her boys. He was educated at home until he spent four years at secondary school in Bienne, which he entered in 1818 and completed his elementary studies in Lausanne. Agassiz studied at the Universities of Zürich, Heidelberg and Munich. At the last one, he extended his knowledge of natural history, especially of botany. In 1829, he received the degree of doctor of philosophy at Erlangen and, in 1830, that of doctor of medicine at Munich. 
Moving to Paris, he came under the tutelage of Alexander von Humboldt and later received his financial benevolence. Humboldt and Georges Cuvier launched him on his careers of respectively geology and zoology. Ichthyology soon became a focus of Agassiz&#x27;s life&#x27;s work.

==Early work==

In 1819 to 1820, the German biologists Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius undertook an expedition to Brazil. They returned home to Europe with many natural objects, including an important collection of the freshwater fish of Brazil, especially of the Amazon River. Spix, who died in 1826, likely from a tropical disease, did not live long enough to work out the history of those fish, and Martius selected Agassiz for this project.

Agassiz threw himself into the work with an enthusiasm that would go on to characterize the rest of his life&#x27;s work. The task of describing the Brazilian fish was completed and published in 1829. It was followed by research into the history of fish found in Lake Neuchâtel. Enlarging his plans, he in 1830 issued a prospectus of a &quot;History of the Freshwater Fish of Central Europe&quot;. In 1839, however, the first part of the publication appeared, and it was completed in 1842.

In November 1832, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuchâtel, at a salary of about US$400 and declined brilliant offers in Paris because of the leisure for private study that that position afforded him. The fossil fish in the rock of the surrounding region, the slates of Glarus and the limestones of Monte Bolca, soon attracted his attention. At the time, very little had been accomplished in their scientific study. Agassiz as early as 1829, planned the publication of a work. More than any other, it would lay the foundation of his worldwide fame. Five volumes of his &quot;Recherches sur les poissons fossiles&quot; (&quot;Research on Fossil Fish&quot;) were published from 1833 to 1843. They were magnificently illustrated, chiefly by Joseph Dinkel. In gathering materials for that work, Agassiz visited the principal museums in Europe. Meeting Cuvier in Paris, he received much encouragement and assistance from him.

In 1833, he married Cecile Braun, the sister of his friend Alexander Braun and established his household at Neuchâtel. Trained to scientific drawing by her brothers, his wife was of the greatest assistance to Agassiz, with some of the most beautiful plates in &quot;fossil&quot; and &quot;freshwater&quot; fishes being drawn by her.
Agassiz found that his palaeontological analyses required a new ichthyological classification. The fossils that he examined rarely showed any traces of the soft tissues of fish but instead, consisted chiefly of the teeth, scales, and fins, with the bones being perfectly preserved in comparatively few instances. He therefore adopted a classification that divided fish into four groups (ganoids, placoids, cycloids, and ctenoids), based on the nature of the scales and other dermal appendages. That did much to improve fish taxonomy, but Agassiz&#x27;s classification has since been superseded.

With Louis de Coulon, both father and son, he founded the &quot;Societé des Sciences Naturelles&quot;, of which he was the first secretary and in conjunction with the Coulons also arranged a provisional museum of natural history in the orphan&#x27;s home. Agassiz needed financial support to continue his work. The British Association and the Earl of Ellesmere, then Lord Francis Egerton, stepped in to help. The 1290 original drawings made for the work were purchased by the Earl and presented by him to the Geological Society of London. In 1836, the Wollaston Medal was awarded to Agassiz by the council of that society for his work on fossil ichthyology. In 1838, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society. Meanwhile, invertebrate animals engaged his attention. In 1837, he issued the &quot;Prodrome&quot; of a monograph on the recent and fossil Echinodermata, the first part of which appeared in 1838; in 1839–1840, he published two quarto volumes on the fossil echinoderms of Switzerland; and in 1840–1845, he issued his &quot;Études critiques sur les mollusques fossiles&quot; (&quot;Critical Studies on Fossil Mollusks&quot;).

Before Agassiz&#x27;s first visit to England in 1834, Hugh Miller and other geologists had brought to light the remarkable fossil fish of the Old Red Sandstone of the northeast of Scotland. The strange forms of &quot;Pterichthys&quot;, &quot;Coccosteus&quot;, and other genera were then made known to geologists for the first time. They were of intense interest to Agassiz and formed the subject of a monograph by him published in 1844–1(45: &quot;Monographie des poissons fossiles du Vieux Grès Rouge, ou Système Dévonien (Old Red Sandstone) des Îles Britanniques et de Russie&quot; (&quot;Monograph on Fossil Fish of the Old Red Sandstone, or Devonian System of the British Isles and of Russia&quot;). In the early stages of his career in Neuchatel, Agassiz also made a name for himself as a man who could run a scientific department well. Under his care, the University of Neuchâtel soon became a leading institution for scientific inquiry.
In 1842 to 1846, Agassiz issued his &quot;Nomenclator Zoologicus&quot;, a classification list with references of all names used in zoological genera and groups.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1843.

==Ice age==
The vacation of 1836 was spent by Agassiz and his wife in the little village of Bex, where he met Jean de Charpentier and Ignaz Venetz. Their recently announced glacial theories had startled the scientific world, and Agassiz returned to Neuchâtel as an enthusiastic convert. In 1837, Agassiz proposed that the Earth had been subjected to a past ice age. He presented the theory to the Helvetic Society that ancient glaciers flowed outward from the Alps, and even larger glaciers had covered the plains and mountains of Europe, Asia, and North America and smothered the entire Northern Hemisphere in a prolonged ice age. In the same year, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Before that proposal, Goethe, de Saussure, Ignaz Venetz, Jean de Charpentier, Karl Friedrich Schimper, and others had studied the glaciers of the Alps, and Goethe, Charpentier, and Schimper had even concluded that the erratic blocks of alpine rocks scattered over the slopes and summits of the Jura Mountains had been moved there by glaciers. Those ideas attracted the attention of Agassiz, and he discussed them with Charpentier and Schimper, whom he accompanied on successive trips to the Alps. Agassiz even had a hut constructed upon one of the Aar Glaciers and for a time made it his home to investigate the structure and movements of the ice.

Agassiz visited England, and with William Buckland, the only English naturalist who shared his ideas, made a tour of the British Isles in search of glacial phenomena, and became satisfied that his theory of an ice age was correct. In 1840, Agassiz published a two-volume work, &quot;Études sur les glaciers&quot; (&quot;Studies on Glaciers&quot;). In it, he discussed the movements of the glaciers, their moraines, and their influence in grooving and rounding the rocks and in producing the striations and &quot;roches moutonnées&quot; seen in Alpine-style landscapes. He accepted Charpentier and Schimper&#x27;s idea that some of the alpine glaciers had extended across the wide plains and valleys of the Aar and Rhône, but he went further by concluding that in the recent past, Switzerland had been covered with one vast sheet of ice originating in the higher Alps and extending over the valley of northwestern Switzerland to the southern slopes of the Jura. The publication of the work gave fresh impetus to the study of glacial phenomena in all parts of the world.

Familiar then with recent glaciation, Agassiz and the English geologist William Buckland visited the mountains of Scotland in 1840. There, they found clear evidence in different locations of glacial action. The discovery was announced to the Geological Society of London in successive communications. The mountainous districts of England, Wales, and Ireland were understood to have been centres for the dispersion of glacial debris. Agassiz remarked &quot;that great sheets of ice, resembling those now existing in Greenland, once covered all the countries in which unstratified gravel (boulder drift) is found; that this gravel was in general produced by the trituration of the sheets of ice upon the subjacent surface, etc.&quot;
In his later years, Agassiz applied his glacial theories to the geology of the Brazilian tropics, including the Amazon. Agassiz began with a working hypothesis which could be tested by the results of fieldwork to find either inconclusive, or conclusively supporting or refuting evidence. A hypothesis that can be conclusively refuted is better than a hypothesis that is difficult to test. Agassiz had a close association with his student and field assistant, the geologist Charles Hartt who eventually refuted Agassiz&#x27;s theories about the Amazon based on his fieldwork there. Instead of evidence for any glacial processes, he found chemically weathered sediments from marine and tropical fluvial, not glacial, processes, a finding that later geologists confirmed. Agassiz hypothesis that the Amazon was affected by the Last Glacial Maximum was correct, although the mechanism causing the effect was non-glacial. The Amazon rainforest was split into two large blocks by extensive savanna during the LGM.

==United States==
With the aid of a grant of money from the king of Prussia, Agassiz crossed the Atlantic in the autumn of 1846 to investigate the natural history and geology of North America and to deliver a course of lectures on &quot;The Plan of Creation as shown in the Animal Kingdom&quot; by invitation from John Amory Lowell, at the Lowell Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. The financial offers that were presented to him in the United States induced him to settle there, where he remained to the end of his life. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1846.

In 1846, still married to Cecilie, who remained with their three children in Switzerland, Agassiz met Elizabeth Cabot Cary at a dinner. The two developed a romantic attachment, and when his wife died in 1848, they made plans to marry. The ceremony took place on April 25, 1850, in Boston, Massachusetts at King&#x27;s Chapel. Agassiz brought his children to live with them, and Elizabeth raised and developed close relationships with her step-children. She had no children of her own.

Agassiz had a mostly cordial relationship with the Harvard botanist Asa Gray despite their disagreements. Agassiz believed each human race had been separately created, but Gray, a supporter of Charles Darwin, believed in the shared evolutionary ancestry of all humans. In addition, Agassiz was a member of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the more autocratic academic structures of European universities, but Gray was a staunch opponent of that group.

Agassiz&#x27;s engagement for the Lowell Institute lectures precipitated the establishment in 1847 of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard University, with Agassiz as its head. Harvard appointed him professor of zoology and geology, and he founded the Museum of Comparative Zoology there in 1859 and served as its first director until his death in 1873. During his tenure at Harvard, Agassiz studied the effect of the last ice age in North America. In August 1857, Agassiz was offered the chair of palaeontology in the Museum of Natural History, Paris, which he refused. He was later decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honor.

Agassiz continued his lectures for the Lowell Institute. In succeeding years, he gave lectures on &quot;Ichthyology&quot; (1847–1848), &quot;Comparative Embryology&quot; (1848–1849), &quot;Functions of Life in Lower Animals&quot; (1850–1851), &quot;Natural History&quot; (1853–1854), &quot;Methods of Study in Natural History&quot; (1861–1862), &quot;Glaciers and the Ice Period&quot; (1864–1865), &quot;Brazil&quot; (1866–1867), and &quot;Deep Sea Dredging&quot; (1869–1870). In 1850, he had married Elizabeth Cabot Cary, who later wrote introductory books about natural history and a lengthy biography of her husband after he had died.

Agassiz served as a nonresident lecturer at Cornell University while he was also on faculty at Harvard. In 1852, he accepted a medical professorship of comparative anatomy at Charlestown, Massachusetts, but he resigned in two years. From then on, Agassiz&#x27;s scientific studies dropped off, but he became one of the best-known scientists in the world. By 1857, Agassiz was so well-loved that his friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote &quot;The Fiftieth Birthday of Agassiz&quot; in his honor and read it at a dinner given for Agassiz by the Saturday Club in Cambridge. Agassiz&#x27;s own writing continued with four (of a planned 10) volumes of &quot;Natural History of the United States&quot;, published from 1857 to 1862. He also published a catalog of papers in his field, &quot;Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae&quot;, in four volumes between 1848 and 1854.

Stricken by ill health in the 1860s, Agassiz resolved to return to the field for relaxation and to resume his studies of Brazilian fish. In April 1865, he led the Thayer Expedition to Brazil. While there, he commissioned two photographers, Augusto Stahl and Georges Leuzinger, to accompany the expedition and produce somatological images of Indigenous people and enslaved Africans and Black people. After his return in August 1866, an account of the expedition, &quot;A Journey in Brazil&quot;, was published in 1868. In December 1871, he made a second eight-month excursion, known as the &quot;Hassler&quot; expedition under the command of Commander Philip Carrigan Johnson (the brother of Eastman Johnson) and visited South America on its southern Atlantic and Pacific Seaboards. The ship explored the Magellan Strait, which drew the praise of Charles Darwin.

Following the establishment of the first U.S. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in New York City in 1866, Agassiz was called on to help settle disputes about animal behavior. He deemed the way turtles were shipped caused them suffering, while P.T. Barnum argued with Agassiz&#x27; support that his snakes would eat only live animals.

His second wife, Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, assisted him in preparing his &quot;A Journey in Brazil&quot;. Along with her stepson, Alexander Agassiz, she wrote &quot;Seaside Studies in Natural History&quot; and &quot;Marine Animals of Massachusetts&quot;. Elizabeth wrote at the Strait that &quot;the &quot;Hassler&quot; pursued her course, past a seemingly endless panorama of mountains and forests rising into the pale regions of snow and ice, where lay glaciers in which every rift and crevasse, as well as the many cascades flowing down to join the waters beneath, could be counted as she steamed by them... These were weeks of exquisite delight to Agassiz. The vessel often skirted the shore so closely that its geology could be studied from the deck.&quot;

==Family==

From his first marriage to Cecilie Braun, Agassiz had two daughters, Ida and Pauline, and a son, Alexander.
In 1863, Agassiz&#x27;s daughter Ida married Henry Lee Higginson, who later founded the Boston Symphony Orchestra and was a benefactor to Harvard and other schools. On November 30, 1860, Agassiz&#x27;s daughter Pauline was married to Quincy Adams Shaw (1825–1908), a wealthy Boston merchant and later a benefactor to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Pauline Agassiz Shaw later became a prominent educator, suffragist, and philanthropist.

==Later life==
In the last years of his life, Agassiz worked to establish a permanent school in which zoological science could be pursued amid the living subjects of its study. In 1873, the private philanthropist John Anderson gave Agassiz the island of Penikese, in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts (south of New Bedford), and presented him with $50,000 to endow it permanently as a practical school of natural science that would be especially devoted to the study of marine zoology. The school collapsed soon after Agassiz&#x27;s death but is considered to be a precursor of the nearby Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory.

Agassiz had a profound influence on the American branches of his two fields and taught many future scientists who would go on to prominence, including Alpheus Hyatt, David Starr Jordan, Joel Asaph Allen, Joseph Le Conte, Ernest Ingersoll, William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, Nathaniel Shaler, Samuel Hubbard Scudder, Alpheus Packard, and his son Alexander Emanuel Agassiz. He had a profound impact on the paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott and the natural scientist Edward S. Morse. Agassiz had a reputation for being a demanding teacher. He would allegedly &quot;lock a student up in a room full of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not let him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained.&quot; Two of Agassiz&#x27;s most prominent students detailed their personal experiences under his tutelage: Scudder, in a short magazine article for&quot; Every Saturday&quot;, and Shaler, in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;. Those and other recollections were collected and published by Lane Cooper in 1917, which Ezra Pound would draw on for his anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.

In the early 1840s, Agassiz named two fossil fish species after Mary Anning (&quot;Acrodus anningiae&quot; and &quot;Belenostomus anningiae&quot;) and another after her friend, Elizabeth Philpot. Anning was a paleontologist known around the world for important finds, but because of her gender, she was often not formally recognized for her work. Agassiz was grateful for the help that the women gave him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834.

Agassiz died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1873 and was buried on the Bellwort Path at Mount Auburn Cemetery, joined later by his wife. His monument is a boulder from a glacial moraine of the Aar near the site of the old Hôtel des Neuchâtelois, not far from the spot where his hut once stood. His grave is sheltered by pine trees from his old home in Switzerland.

==Legacy==
The Cambridge elementary school north of Harvard University was named in his honor, and the surrounding neighborhood became known as &quot;Agassiz&quot; as a result. The school&#x27;s name was changed to the Maria L. Baldwin School on May 21, 2002, because of concerns about Agassiz&#x27;s involvement in scientific racism and to honor Maria Louise Baldwin, the African-American principal of the school, who served from 1889 to 1922. The neighborhood, however, continued to be known as Agassiz. , neighborhood residents decided to rename the neighborhood&#x27;s community council as the &quot;Agassiz-Baldwin Community&quot;. Then, in July 2021, culminating a two-year effort on the part of neighborhood residents, the Cambridge City Council voted unanimously to change the name to the Baldwin Neighborhood. An elementary school, the Agassiz Elementary School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, existed from 1922 to 1981.

===Geological tributes===

An ancient glacial lake that formed in central North America, Lake Agassiz, is named after him, as are Mount Agassiz in California&#x27;s Palisades, Mount Agassiz in the Uinta Mountains of Utah, Agassiz Peak in Arizona, Agassiz Rock in Massachusetts, and the Agassizhorn in the Bernese Alps in his native Switzerland. Agassiz Glacier in Montana, Agassiz Creek in Glacier National Park, Agassiz Glacier in the Saint Elias Mountains of Alaska, and Mount Agassiz in the White Mountains of New Hampshire also bear his name. A crater on Mars, &quot;Crater Agassiz&quot;, and a promontorium on the moon are also named in his honor. Cape Agassiz, a headland situated in Palmer Land, Antarctica, is named in his honor. A main-belt asteroid, 2267 Agassiz, is also named in association with him.

===Tribute awards===
In 2005, the European Geosciences Union Division on Cryospheric Sciences established the Louis Agassiz Medal, awarded to individuals in recognition of their outstanding scientific contribution to the study of the cryosphere on Earth or elsewhere in the solar system.

Agassiz took part in a monthly gathering called the Saturday Club at the Parker House, a meeting of Boston writers and intellectuals. He was therefore mentioned in a stanza of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. poem &quot;:&quot;

=== Daguerreotypes of Renty and Delia Taylor ===

In 1850, Agassiz commissioned daguerreotypes, which were described as &quot;haunting and voyeuristic&quot; of the enslaved Renty Taylor and Taylor&#x27;s daughter, Delia, to further his arguments about black inferiority. They are the earliest known photographs of enslaved persons. Agassiz left the images to Harvard, and they remained in the Peabody Museum&#x27;s attic until 1976, when they were rediscovered by Ellie Reichlin, a former staff member. The 15 daguerrotypes were in a case with the embossing &quot;J. T. Zealy, Photographer, Columbia,&quot; with several handwritten labels, which helped in later identification. Reichlin spent months doing research to try to identify the people in the photos, but Harvard University did not make efforts to contact the families and licensed the photos for use.

In 2011, Tamara Lanier wrote a letter to the president of Harvard that identified herself as a direct descendant of the Taylors and asked the university to turn over the photos to her.

In 2019, Taylor&#x27;s descendants sued Harvard for the return of the images and unspecified damages. The lawsuit was supported by 43 living descendants of Agassiz, who wrote in a letter of support, &quot;For Harvard to give the daguerreotypes to Ms. Lanier and her family would begin to make amends for its use of the photos as exhibits for the white supremacist theory Agassiz espoused.&quot; Everyone must evaluate fully &quot;his role in promoting a pseudoscientific justification for white supremacy.&quot;

==Polygenism and racism==
Agassiz was a well-known natural scientist of his generation in America. In addition to being a natural scientist, Agassiz wrote prolifically in the field of scientific polygenism after he came to the United States.

Upon arriving in Boston in 1846, Agassiz spent a few months acquainting himself with the northeast region of the United States. He spent much of his time with Samuel George Morton, a famous American anthropologist at the time who became well known by analyzing fossils brought back by Lewis and Clark. One of Morton’s personal projects involved studying cranial capacity of human skulls from around the world. Morton aimed to use craniometry to prove that white people were biologically superior to other races. His work &quot;Crania Aegyptiaca&quot; claimed to support the polygenism belief that the races were created separately and each had their own unique attributes.

Morton relied on other scientists to send him skulls along with information about where they were acquired. Factors that can affect cranial capacity, such as body size and gender, were not taken into consideration by Morton. He made questionable judgment calls such as dismissing Hindu skull calculations from his Caucasian cranial measurements because they brought the overall average down. Oppositely, he included Peruvian skull measurements alongside Native American calculations even though the Peruvian numbers lowered the average score. Despite Morton&#x27;s unsound methods, his published work on cranial capacities across races was deemed authoritative in the United States and Europe. Morton is a primary influence on Agassiz&#x27;s belief in polygenism.

John Amory Lowell invited Agassiz to present twelve lectures in December 1846 on three subjects titled &quot;&quot;The Plan of Creation as shown in the Animal Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Ichthyology,&quot; and &quot;Comparative Embryology&quot;&quot; as a part of the Lowell Lecture series. These lectures were widely attended with up to 5,000 people in attendance on some nights. It was during these lectures that Agassiz announced for the first time that black and white people had different origins but were part of the same species. Agassiz repeated this lecture 10 months later to the Charleston Literary Club but changed his original stance, claiming that black people were physiologically and anatomically a distinct species.

Agassiz believed that humans did not descend from one single common ancestor. He believed that like plants and animals, various regions have differentiated species of humans. He considered this hypothesis testable, and matched to the available evidence. He also indicated that there were obvious geographical barriers that were the likely cause of speciation.

Stephen Jay Gould asserted that Agassiz&#x27;s observations sprang from racist bias, in particular from his revulsion on first encountering African-Americans in the United States. Referencing letters written by Agassiz, Gould compares Agassiz&#x27; public display of dispassionate objectivity to his private correspondence, in which he describes &quot;the production of half breeds&quot; as &quot;a sin against nature...&quot; Describing the interbreeding of white and black people, he warns, &quot;We have already had to struggle, in our progress, against the influence of universal equality... but how shall we eradicate the stigma of a lower race when its blood has once been allowed to flow freely into our children.&quot; In contrast, others have asserted that, despite favoring polygenism, Agassiz rejected racism and believed in a spiritualized human unity. However, in the same article, Agassiz asks the reader to consider the hierarchy of races, mentioning &quot;The indomitable, courageous, proud Indian, – in how very different a light he stands by the side of the submissive, obsequious, imitative negro, or by the side of the tricky, cunning, and cowardly Mongolian! Are not these facts indications that the different races do not rank upon one level in nature?&quot;

Agassiz never supported slavery and claimed his views on polygenism had nothing to do with politics. His views on polygenism have been claimed to have emboldened proponents of slavery.

Accusations of racism against Agassiz have prompted the renaming of landmarks, schoolhouses, and other institutions (which abound in Massachusetts) that bear his name. Opinions about those moves are often mixed, given his extensive scientific legacy in other areas, and uncertainty about his actual racial beliefs. In 2007, the Swiss government acknowledged his &quot;racist thinking&quot;, but declined to rename the Agassizhorn summit. In 2017, the Swiss Alpine Club declined to revoke Agassiz&#x27;s status as a member of honor, which he received in 1865 for his scientific work, because the club considered that status to have lapsed on Agassiz&#x27;s death. In 2020, the Stanford Department of Psychology asked for a statue of Louis Agassiz to be removed from the front façade of its building. In 2021, Chicago Public Schools announced they would remove Agassiz&#x27;s name from an elementary school and rename it for the abolitionist and political activist, Harriet Tubman. In 2022, The Trustees of Reservations renamed Agassiz Rock as The Monoliths.

<doc id="18024" wikidata="Q7071" url="?curid=18024" title="Li Bai">
<text>Li Bai (, 701–762), also pronounced Li Bo, courtesy name Taibai (), was a Chinese poet acclaimed as one of the greatest and most important poets of the Tang dynasty and in Chinese history as a whole. He and his friend Du Fu (712–770) were two of the most prominent figures in the flourishing of Chinese poetry under the Tang dynasty, which is often called the &quot;Golden Age of Chinese Poetry&quot;. The expression &quot;Three Wonders&quot; denotes Li Bai&#x27;s poetry, Pei Min&#x27;s swordplay, and Zhang Xu&#x27;s calligraphy.

Around 1,000 poems attributed to Li are extant. His poems have been collected into the most important Tang dynasty collection, &quot;Heyue yingling ji&quot;, compiled in 753 by Yin Fan. Thirty-four of Li Bai&#x27;s poems are included in the anthology &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;, which was first published in the 18th century. Around the same time, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe. The poems became models for celebrating the pleasures of friendship, the depth of nature, solitude, and the joys of drinking. Among the most famous are &quot;Waking from Drunkenness on a Spring Day&quot; (Chinese: 春日醉起言志), &quot;The Hard Road to Shu&quot; (Chinese: 蜀道难), &quot;Bring in the Wine&quot; (Chinese: 将进酒), and &quot;Quiet Night Thought&quot; (Chinese: 静夜思), which are still taught in schools in China. In the West, multilingual translations of Li&#x27;s poems continue to be made. His life has even taken on a legendary aspect, including tales of drunkenness and chivalry, and the well-known tale that Li drowned when he reached from his boat to grasp the moon&#x27;s reflection in the river while he was drunk.

Much of Li&#x27;s life is reflected in his poems, which are about places he visited; friends whom he saw off on journeys to distant locations, perhaps never to meet again; his own dream-like imaginings, embroidered with shamanic overtones; current events of which he had news; descriptions of nature, perceived as if in a timeless moment; and more. However, of particular importance are the changes in China during his lifetime. His early poems were written in a &quot;golden age&quot; of internal peace and prosperity, under an emperor who actively promoted and participated in the arts. This ended with the beginning of the rebellion of general An Lushan, which eventually left most of Northern China devastated by war and famine. Li&#x27;s poems during this period take on new tones and qualities. Unlike his younger friend Du Fu, Li did not live to see the end of the chaos. Li Bai is depicted in the &quot;Wu Shuang Pu&quot; (無雙譜, &quot;Table of Peerless Heroes&quot;) by Jin Guliang.

==Names==
Li Bai&#x27;s name has been romanized as Li Bai, Li Po, Li Bo (romanizations of Standard Chinese pronunciations), and Ri Haku (a romanization of the Japanese pronunciation). The varying Chinese romanizations are due to the facts that his given name () has two pronunciations in Standard Chinese: the literary reading &quot;bó&quot; () and the colloquial reading &quot;bái&quot;; and that earlier authors used Wade–Giles while modern authors prefer pinyin. The reconstructed version of how he and others during the Tang dynasty would have pronounced this is &quot;Bhæk&quot;. His courtesy name was Taibai (太白), literally &quot;Great White&quot;, as the planet Venus was called at the time; according to his biography in the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, this was because Li&#x27;s mother had dreamt of Venus while giving birth to him. Li&#x27;s courtesy name has been romanized variously as &quot;Li Taibo&quot;, &quot;Li Taibai&quot;, &quot;Li Tai-po&quot;, among others. The Japanese pronunciation of his name and courtesy name may be romanized as &quot;Ri Haku&quot; and &quot;Ri Taihaku&quot; respectively.

He is also known by his art name (&quot;hao&quot;) &quot;Qīnglián Jūshì&quot; (), meaning &quot;Householder of Azure Lotus&quot;, or by the nicknames &quot;Immortal Poet&quot; (Poet Transcendent; Wine Immortal (), Banished Transcendent (), Poet-Knight-errant (, or &quot;Poet-Hero&quot;).

==Life==

The two &quot;Books of Tang&quot;, &quot;The Old Book of Tang&quot; and &quot;The New Book of Tang&quot;, remain the primary sources of bibliographical material on Li Bai. Other sources include internal evidence from poems by or about Li Bai, and certain other sources, such as the preface to his collected poems by his relative and literary executor, Li Yangbin.

===Background and birth===
Li Bai is generally considered to have been born in 701, in Suyab (碎葉) of ancient Chinese Central Asia (present-day Kyrgyzstan), where his family had prospered in business at the frontier. Afterwards, the family under the leadership of his father, Li Ke (李客), moved to Jiangyou (江油), near modern Chengdu, in Sichuan, when the youngster was about five years old. There is some mystery or uncertainty about the circumstances of the family&#x27;s relocations, due to a lack of legal authorization which would have generally been required to move out of the border regions, especially if one&#x27;s family had been assigned or exiled there.

====Background====
Two accounts given by contemporaries Li Yangbing (a family relative) and Fan Chuanzheng state that Li&#x27;s family was originally from what is now southwestern Jingning County, Gansu. Li&#x27;s ancestry is traditionally traced back to Li Gao, the noble founder of the state of Western Liang. This provides some support for Li&#x27;s own claim to be related to the Li dynastic royal family of the Tang dynasty: the Tang emperors also claimed descent from the Li rulers of West Liang. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (). Evidence suggests that during the Sui dynasty, Li&#x27;s own ancestors, at that time for some reason classified socially as commoners, were forced into a form of exile from their original home (in what is now Gansu) to some location or locations further west. During their exile in the far west, the Li family lived in the ancient Silk Road city of Suiye (Suyab, now an archeological site in present-day Kyrgyzstan), and perhaps also in Tiaozhi (), a state near modern Ghazni, Afghanistan. These areas were on the ancient Silk Road, and the Li family were likely merchants. Their business was quite prosperous.

===Early years===
In 705, when Li Bai was four years old, his father secretly moved his family to Sichuan, near Chengdu, where he spent his childhood. Currently, there is a monument commemorating this in Zhongba Town, Jiangyou, Sichuan province (the area of the modern province known then as Shu, after a former independent state which had been annexed by the Sui dynasty and later incorporated into the Tang dynasty lands). The young Li spent most of his growing years in Qinglian (青莲; lit. &quot;Blue [also translated as &#x27;green&#x27;, &#x27;azure&#x27;, or &#x27;nature-coloured&#x27;] Lotus&quot;), a town in Chang-ming County, Sichuan, China. This now nominally corresponds with Qinglian Town (青蓮鎮) of Jiangyou County-level city, in Sichuan.

The young Li read extensively, including Confucian classics such as &quot;The Classic of Poetry (Shijing)&quot; and the &quot;Classic of History (Shujing)&quot;, as well as various astrological and metaphysical materials which Confucians tended to eschew, though he disdained to take the literacy exam. Reading the &quot;Hundred Authors&quot; was part of the family literary tradition, and he was also able to compose poetry before he was ten. The young Li also engaged in other activities, such as taming wild birds and fencing. His other activities included riding, hunting, traveling, and aiding the poor or oppressed by means of both money and arms. Eventually, the young Li seems to have become quite skilled in swordsmanship; as this autobiographical quote by Li himself both testifies to and also helps to illustrate the wild life that he led in the Sichuan of his youth:

Before he was twenty, Li had fought and killed several men, apparently for reasons of chivalry, in accordance with the knight-errant tradition (&quot;youxia&quot;).

In 720, he was interviewed by Governor Su Ting, who considered him a genius. Though he expressed a wish to become an official, he never took the civil service examination.

===Marriage and family===
Li is known to have married four times. His first marriage, in 727, in Anlu, Hubei, was to the granddaughter of a former government minister. His wife was from the well-connected Xu (许) family. Li Bai made this his home for about ten years, living in a home owned by his wife&#x27;s family on Mt. Bishan (碧山). In 744, he married for the second time in what now is the Liangyuan District of Henan. This marriage was to another poet, surnamed Zong (宗), with whom he both had children and exchanges of poems, including many expressions of love for her and their children. His wife, Zong, was a granddaughter of Zong Chuke (宗楚客, died 710), an important government official during the Tang dynasty and the interregnal period of Wu Zetian.

===On the way to Chang&#x27;an===
====Leaving Sichuan====
In his mid-twenties, about 725, Li Bai left Sichuan, sailing down the Yangzi River through Dongting Lake to Nanjing, beginning his days of wandering. He then went back up-river, to Yunmeng, in what is now Hubei, where his marriage to the granddaughter of a retired prime minister, Xu Yushi, seems to have formed but a brief interlude. During the first year of his trip, he met celebrities and gave away much of his wealth to needy friends.

In 730, Li Bai stayed at Zhongnan Mountain near the capital Chang&#x27;an (Xi&#x27;an), and tried but failed to secure a position. He sailed down the Yellow River, stopped by Luoyang, and visited Taiyuan before going home. In 735, Li Bai was in Shanxi, where he intervened in a court martial against Guo Ziyi, who was later, after becoming one of the top Tang generals, to repay the favour during the An Shi disturbances. By perhaps 740, he had moved to Shandong. It was in Shandong at this time that he became one of the group known as the &quot;Six Idlers of the Bamboo Brook&quot;, an informal group dedicated to literature and wine. He wandered about the area of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, eventually making friends with a famous Daoist priest, Wu Yun. In 742, Wu Yun was summoned by the Emperor to attend the imperial court, where his praise of Li Bai was great.

===At Chang&#x27;an===
Wu Yun&#x27;s praise of Li Bai led Emperor Xuanzong (born Li Longji and also known as Emperor Minghuang) to summon Li to the court in Chang&#x27;an. Li&#x27;s personality fascinated the aristocrats and common people alike, including another Taoist (and poet), He Zhizhang, who bestowed upon him the nickname the &quot;Immortal Exiled from Heaven&quot;. Indeed, after an initial audience, where Li Bai was questioned about his political views, the Emperor was so impressed that he held a big banquet in his honor. At this banquet, the Emperor was said to show his favor, even to the extent of personally seasoning his soup for him.

Emperor Xuanzong employed him as a translator, as Li Bai knew at least one non-Chinese language. Ming Huang eventually gave him a post at the Hanlin Academy, which served to provide scholarly expertise and poetry for the Emperor.

When the emperor ordered Li Bai to the palace, he was often drunk, but quite capable of performing on the spot.

Li Bai wrote several poems about the Emperor&#x27;s beautiful and beloved Yang Guifei, the favorite royal consort. A story, probably apocryphal, circulates about Li Bai during this period. Once, while drunk, Li Bai had gotten his boots muddy, and Gao Lishi, the most politically powerful eunuch in the palace, was asked to assist in the removal of these, in front of the Emperor. Gao took offense at being asked to perform this menial service, and later managed to persuade Yang Guifei to take offense at Li&#x27;s poems concerning her. At the persuasion of Yang Guifei and Gao Lishi, Xuanzong reluctantly, but politely, and with large gifts of gold and silver, sent Li Bai away from the royal court. After leaving the court, Li Bai formally became a Taoist, making a home in Shandong, but wandering far and wide for the next ten some years, writing poems. Li Bai lived and wrote poems at Bishan (or Bi Mountain (碧山), today Baizhao Mountain (白兆山)) in Yandian, Hubei. Bi Mountain (碧山) in the poem &quot;Question and Answer Amongst the Mountains&quot; (山中问答 Shanzhong Wenda) refers to this mountain.

===Meeting Du Fu===

He met Du Fu in the autumn of 744, when they shared a single room and various activities together, such as traveling, hunting, wine, and poetry, thus established a close and lasting friendship. They met again the following year. These were the only occasions on which they met, in person, although they continued to maintain a relationship through poetry. This is reflected in the dozen or so poems by Du Fu to or about Li Bai which survive, and the one from Li Bai directed toward Du Fu which remains.

===War and exile===

At the end of 755, the disorders instigated by the rebel general An Lushan burst across the land. The Emperor eventually fled to Sichuan and abdicated. During the confusion, the Crown Prince opportunely declared himself Emperor and head of the government. The An Shi disturbances continued (as they were later called, since they lasted beyond the death of their instigator, carried on by Shi Siming and others). Li Bai became a staff adviser to Prince Yong, one of Ming Huang&#x27;s (Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s) sons, who was far from the top of the primogeniture list, yet named to share the imperial power as a general after Xuanzong had abdicated, in 756.

However, even before the empire&#x27;s external enemies were defeated, the two brothers fell to fighting each other with their armies. Upon the defeat of the Prince&#x27;s forces by his brother the new emperor in 757, Li Bai escaped, but was later captured, imprisoned in Jiujiang, and sentenced to death. The famous and powerful army general Guo Ziyi and others intervened; Guo Ziyi was the very person whom Li Bai had saved from court martial a couple of decades before. His wife, the lady Zong, and others (such as Song Ruosi) wrote petitions for clemency. Upon General Guo Ziyi&#x27;s offering to exchange his official rank for Li Bai&#x27;s life, Li Bai&#x27;s death sentence was commuted to exile: he was consigned to Yelang. Yelang (in what is now Guizhou) was in the remote extreme southwestern part of the empire, and was considered to be outside the main sphere of Chinese civilization and culture. Li Bai headed toward Yelang with little sign of hurry, stopping for prolonged social visits (sometimes for months), and writing poetry along the way, leaving detailed descriptions of his journey for posterity. Notice of an imperial pardon recalling Li Bai reached him before he even got near Yelang. He had only gotten as far as Wushan, traveling at a leisurely pace, as recorded in the poem &quot;Struggling up the Three Gorges&quot;, intimating that it took so long that his hair turned white during the trip up river, towards exile. Then, news of his pardon caught up with him in 759.

===Return and other travels===
When Li received the news of his imperial pardon, he returned down the river to Jiangxi, passing on the way through Baidicheng, in Kuizhou Prefecture, still engaging in the pleasures of food, wine, good company, and writing poetry; his poem &quot;&quot; records this stage of his travels, as well as poetically mocking his enemies and detractors, implied in his inclusion of imagery of monkeys. Although Li did not cease his wandering lifestyle, he then generally confined his travels to Nanjing and the two Anhui cities of Xuancheng and Li Yang (in modern Zhao County). His poems of this time include nature poems and poems of socio-political protest. Eventually, in 762, Li&#x27;s relative Li Yangbing became magistrate of Dangtu, and Li Bai went to stay with him there. In the meantime, Suzong and Xuanzong both died within a short period of time, and China had a new emperor. Also, China was involved in renewed efforts to suppress further military disorders stemming from the Anshi rebellions, and Li volunteered to serve on the general staff of the Chinese commander Li Guangbi. However, at age 61, Li became critically ill, and his health would not allow him to fulfill this plan.

===Death===

The new Emperor Daizong appointed Li Bai as a court counsellor in January 764, but by the time the imperial edict arrived in Dangtu, Anhui, Li Bai had already been reported dead for more than a year. Local authorities, however, were only able to ascertain that he died sometime in 762, with the date and cause of his death lost to history.

Later writers speculated about Li&#x27;s death. The ninth-century Tang poet Pi Rixiu suggested in a poem that Li had died of chronic thoracic suppuration (pus entering the chest cavity). According to another source, Li Bai drowned after falling from his boat one day while drunk, as he tried to embrace the reflection of the moon in the Yangtze River.

===Calligraphy===

Li Bai was a skilled calligrapher. One surviving piece of his calligraphy work in his own handwriting exists today. The piece is titled &quot;Shàng yáng tái&quot; (&quot;Going Up To Sun Terrace&quot;), a long scroll (with later addition of a title written by Emperor Huizong of Song and a postscript added by the Qianlong Emperor); the calligraphy is housed in the Palace Museum in Beijing, China.

===Surviving texts and editing===
Even Li Bai and Du Fu, the two most famous and most comprehensively edited Tang poets, were affected by the destruction of the imperial Tang libraries and the loss of many private collections in the periods of turmoil (An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion). Although many of Li Bai&#x27;s poems have survived, even more were lost and there is difficulty regarding variant texts. One of the earliest endeavors at editing Li Bai&#x27;s work was by his relative Li Yangbing, the magistrate of Dangtu, with whom he stayed in his final years and to whom he entrusted his manuscripts. However, the most reliable texts are not necessarily in the earliest editions. Song dynasty scholars produced various editions of his poetry, but it was not until the Qing dynasty that such collections as the &quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot; made the most comprehensive studies of the then surviving texts.

==Themes==
Critics have focused on Li Bai&#x27;s strong sense of the continuity of poetic tradition, his glorification of alcoholic beverages (and, indeed, frank celebration of drunkenness), his use of persona, the fantastic extremes of some of his imagery, his mastery of formal poetic rules—and his ability to combine all of these with a seemingly effortless virtuosity to produce inimitable poetry. Other themes in Li&#x27;s poetry, noted especially in the 20th century, are sympathy for the common folk and antipathy towards needless wars (even when conducted by the emperor himself).

===Poetic tradition===

Li Bai had a strong sense of himself as being part of a poetic tradition. The &quot;genius&quot; of Li Bai, says one recent account, &quot;lies at once in his total command of the literary tradition before him and his ingenuity in bending (without breaking) it to discover a uniquely personal idiom...&quot; Burton Watson, comparing him to Du Fu, says Li&#x27;s poetry, &quot;is essentially backward-looking, that it represents more a revival and fulfillment of past promises and glory than a foray into the future.&quot; Watson adds, as evidence, that of all the poems attributed to Li Bai, about one sixth are in the form of &quot;yuefu&quot;, or, in other words, reworked lyrics from traditional folk ballads. As further evidence, Watson cites the existence of a fifty-nine poem collection by Li Bai entitled &quot;Gu Feng&quot;, or &quot;In the Old Manner&quot;, which is, in part, tribute to the poetry of the Han and Wei dynasties. His admiration for certain particular poets is also shown through specific allusions, for example to Qu Yuan or Tao Yuanming, and occasionally by name, for example Du Fu.

A more general appreciation for history is shown on the part of Li Bai in his poems of the &quot;huaigu&quot; genre, or meditations on the past, wherein following &quot;one of the perennial themes of Chinese poetry&quot;, &quot;the poet contemplates the ruins of past glory&quot;.

===Rapt with wine and moon===
John C. H. Wu observed that &quot;while some may have drunk more wine than Li [Bai], no-one has written more poems about wine.&quot; Classical Chinese poets were often associated with drinking wine, and Li Bai was part of the group of Chinese scholars in Chang&#x27;an his fellow poet Du Fu called the &quot;Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup.&quot; The Chinese generally did not find the moderate use of alcohol to be immoral or unhealthy. James J. Y Liu comments that &quot;zui&quot; in poetry &quot;does not mean quite the same thing as &#x27;drunk&#x27;, &#x27;intoxicated&#x27;, or &#x27;inebriated&#x27;, but rather means being mentally carried away from one&#x27;s normal preoccupations ...&quot; Liu translates &quot;zui&quot; as &quot;rapt with wine&quot;. The &quot;Eight Immortals&quot;, however, drank to an unusual degree, though they still were viewed as pleasant eccentrics. Burton Watson concluded that &quot;[n]early all Chinese poets celebrate the joys of wine, but none so tirelessly and with such a note of genuine conviction as Li [Bai]&quot;.

The following two poems, &quot;Rising Drunk on a Spring Day, Telling My Intent&quot; and &quot;Drinking Alone by Moonlight&quot;, are among Li Bai&#x27;s most famous and demonstrate different aspects of his use of wine and drunkenness.


===Fantastic imagery===
An important characteristic of Li Bai&#x27;s poetry &quot;is the fantasy and note of childlike wonder and playfulness that pervade so much of it&quot;. Burton Watson attributes this to a fascination with the Taoist priest, Taoist recluses who practiced alchemy and austerities in the mountains, in the aim of becoming xian, or immortal beings. There is a strong element of Taoism in his works, both in the sentiments they express and in their spontaneous tone, and &quot;many of his poems deal with mountains, often descriptions of ascents that midway modulate into journeys of the imagination, passing from actual mountain scenery to visions of nature deities, immortals, and &#x27;jade maidens&#x27; of Taoist lore&quot;. Watson sees this as another affirmation of Li Bai&#x27;s affinity with the past, and a continuity with the traditions of the Chuci and the early fu. Watson finds this &quot;element of fantasy&quot; to be behind Li Bai&#x27;s use of hyperbole and the &quot;playful personifications&quot; of mountains and celestial objects.

===Nostalgia===
Literary critic James J.Y. Liu notes &quot;Chinese poets seem to be perpetually bewailing their exile and longing to return home. This may seem sentimental to Western readers, but one should remember the vastness of China, the difficulties of communication... the sharp contrast between the highly cultured life in the main cities and the harsh conditions in the remoter regions of the country, and the importance of family...&quot; It is hardly surprising, he concludes, that nostalgia should have become a &quot;constant, and hence conventional, theme in Chinese poetry.&quot;

Liu gives as a prime example Li&#x27;s poem &quot;A Quiet Night Thought&quot; (also translated as &quot;Contemplating Moonlight&quot;), which is often learned by schoolchildren in China. In a mere 20 words, the poem uses the vivid moonlight and frost imagery to convey the feeling of homesickness. This translation is by Yang Xianyi and Dai Naidie:

===Use of persona===
Li Bai also wrote a number of poems from various viewpoints, including the personae of women. For example, he wrote several poems in the &quot;Zi Ye&quot;, or &quot;Lady Midnight&quot; style, as well as Han folk-ballad style poems.

===Technical virtuosity===
Li Bai is well known for the technical virtuosity of his poetry and the mastery of his verses. In terms of poetic form, &quot;critics generally agree that Li [Bai] produced no significant innovations ... In theme and content also, his poetry is notable less for the new elements it introduces than for the skill with which he brightens the old ones.&quot;

Burton Watson comments on Li Bai&#x27;s famous poem, which he translates &quot;Bring the Wine&quot;: &quot;like so much of Li [Bai]&#x27;s work, it has a grace and effortless dignity that somehow make it more compelling than earlier treatment of the same.&quot;

Li Bai&#x27;s yuefu poems have been called the greatest of all time by Ming-dynasty scholar and writer Hu Yinglin.

Li Bai especially excelled in the Gushi form, or &quot;old style&quot; poems, a type of poetry allowing a great deal of freedom in terms of the form and content of the work. An example is his poem &quot;蜀道難&quot;, translated by Witter Bynner as &quot;Hard Roads in Shu&quot;. Shu is a poetic term for Sichuan, the destination of refuge that Emperor Xuanzong considered fleeing to escape the approaching forces of the rebel General An Lushan. Watson comments that, this poem, &quot;employs lines that range in length from four to eleven characters, the form of the lines suggesting by their irregularity the jagged peaks and bumpy mountain roads of Sichuan depicted in the poem.&quot;

Li Bai was also noted as a master of the jueju, or cut-verse. Ming-dynasty poet Li Pan Long thought Li Bai was the greatest jueju master of the Tang dynasty.

Li Bai was noted for his mastery of the lüshi, or &quot;regulated verse&quot;, the formally most demanding verse form of the times. Watson notes, however, that his poem &quot;Seeing a Friend Off&quot; was &quot;unusual in that it violates the rule that the two middle couplets ... must observe verbal parallelism&quot;, adding that Chinese critics excused this kind of violation in the case of a genius like Li.

==Influence==
===In the East===
Li Bai&#x27;s poetry was immensely influential in his own time, as well as for subsequent generations in China. From early on, he was paired with Du Fu. The recent scholar Paula Varsano observes that &quot;in the literary imagination they were, and remain, the two greatest poets of the Tang—or even of China&quot;. Yet she notes the persistence of &quot;what we can rightly call the &#x27;Li-Du debate&#x27;, the terms of which became so deeply ingrained in the critical discourse surrounding these two poets that almost any characterization of the one implicitly critiqued the other&quot;. Li&#x27;s influence has also been demonstrated in the immediate geographical area of Chinese cultural influence, being known as Ri Haku in Japan. This influence continues even today. Examples range from poetry to painting and to literature.

In his own lifetime, during his many wanderings and while he was attending court in Chang&#x27;an, Li Bai met and parted from various contemporary poets. These meetings and separations were typical occasions for versification in the tradition of the literate Chinese of the time, a prime example being his relationship with Du Fu.

After his lifetime, Li Bai&#x27;s influence continued to grow. Some four centuries later, during the Song dynasty, for example, just in the case of his poem that is sometimes translated &quot;Drinking Alone Beneath the Moon&quot;, the poet Yang Wanli wrote a whole poem alluding to it (and to two other Li Bai poems), in the same &quot;gushi&quot;, or old-style poetry form.

In the 20th century, Li Bai even influenced the poetry of Mao Zedong.

In China, his poem &quot;Quiet Night Thoughts&quot;, reflecting a nostalgia of a traveller away from home, has been widely &quot;memorized by school children and quoted by adults&quot;.

He is sometimes worshipped as an immortal in Chinese folk religion and is also considered a divinity in Vietnam Cao Dai religion.

===In the West===
Austrian composer Gustav Mahler used German adaptations of four of Li&#x27;s poems as texts for four of the songs in his song-symphony Das Lied von der Erde in 1908. American composer Harry Partch based his &quot;Seventeen Lyrics by Li Po&quot; (early 1930s, his earliest surviving acknowledged work) for intoning voice and Adapted Viola (an instrument of Partch&#x27;s own invention) on texts in &quot;The Works of Li Po, the Chinese Poet&quot; translated by Shigeyoshi Obata. Around the same time (1931), Swiss composer Volkmar Andreae set eight poems as &quot;Li-Tai-Pe: Eight Chinese songs for tenor and orchestra, op. 37&quot;. In Brazil, the songwriter Beto Furquim included a musical setting of the poem &quot;Jing Ye Si&quot; in his album &quot;Muito Prazer&quot;.

====Ezra Pound====
Li Bai is influential in the West partly due to Ezra Pound&#x27;s versions of some of his poems in the collection &quot;&quot;Cathay&quot;&quot;, (Pound transliterating his name according to the Japanese manner as &quot;Rihaku&quot;). Li Bai&#x27;s interactions with nature, friendship, his love of wine and his acute observations of life inform his more popular poems. Some, like &quot;Changgan xing&quot; (translated by Ezra Pound as &quot;The River Merchant&#x27;s Wife: A Letter&quot;), record the hardships or emotions of common people. An example of the liberal, but poetically influential, translations, or adaptations, of Japanese versions of his poems made, largely based on the work of Ernest Fenollosa and professors Mori and Ariga.

====Gustav Mahler====
Gustav Mahler integrated four of Li Bai&#x27;s works into his symphonic song cycle &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. These were derived from free German translations by Hans Bethge, published in an anthology called (&quot;The Chinese Flute&quot;), Bethge based his versions on the collection &quot;Chinesische Lyrik&quot; by Hans Heilmann (1905). Heilmann worked from pioneering 19th-century translations into French: three by the Marquis d&#x27;Hervey-Saint-Denys and one (only distantly related to the Chinese) by Judith Gautier. Mahler freely changed Bethge&#x27;s text.

====Reference in Beat Generation====
Li Bai&#x27;s poetry can be seen as having an influence on Beat Generation writer Gary Snyder during Snyder&#x27;s years of studying Asian culture and Zen. Li Bai&#x27;s style of descriptive writing contributed to the diversity within the Beat writing style.

==Translation==
Li Bai&#x27;s poetry was introduced to Europe by Jean Joseph Marie Amiot, a Jesuit missionary in Beijing, in his &quot;Portraits des Célèbres Chinois&quot;, published in the series &quot;Mémoires concernant l&#x27;histoire, les sciences, les arts, les mœurs, les usages, &amp;c. des Chinois, par les missionnaires de Pekin&quot;. (1776–1797). Further translations into French were published by Marquis d&#x27;Hervey de Saint-Denys in his 1862 &quot;Poésies de l&#x27;Époque des Thang&quot;.

Joseph Edkins read a paper, &quot;On Li Tai-po&quot;, to the Peking Oriental Society in 1888, which was subsequently published in that society&#x27;s journal. The early sinologist Herbert Allen Giles included translations of Li Bai in his 1898 publication &quot;Chinese Poetry in English Verse&quot;, and again in his &quot;History of Chinese Literature&quot; (1901). The third early translator into English was L. Cranmer-Byng (1872–1945). His &quot;Lute of Jade: Being Selections from the Classical Poets of China&quot; (1909) and &quot;A Feast of Lanterns&quot; (1916) both featured Li&#x27;s poetry.

Renditions of Li Bai&#x27;s poetry into modernist English poetry were influential through Ezra Pound in &quot;Cathay&quot; (1915) and Amy Lowell in &quot;Fir-Flower Tablets&quot; (1921). Neither worked directly from the Chinese: Pound relied on more or less literal, word for word, though not terribly accurate, translations of Ernest Fenollosa and what Pound called the &quot;decipherings&quot; of professors Mori and Ariga; Lowell on those of Florence Ayscough. Witter Bynner with the help of Kiang Kang-hu included several of Li&#x27;s poems in &quot;The Jade Mountain&quot; (1939). Although Li was not his preferred poet, Arthur Waley translated a few of his poems into English for the &quot;Asiatic Review&quot;, and included them in his &quot;More Translations from the Chinese&quot;. Shigeyoshi Obata, in his 1922 &quot;The Works of Li Po&quot;, claimed he had made &quot;the first attempt ever made to deal with any single Chinese poet exclusively in one book for the purpose of introducing him to the English-speaking world.&quot; A translation of Li Bai&#x27;s poem &quot;Green Moss&quot; by poet William Carlos Williams was sent as a letter to Chinese American poet David Rafael Wang where Williams was seen as having a similar tone as Pound.

Li Bai became a favorite among translators for his straightforward and seemingly simple style. Later translations are too numerous to discuss here, but an extensive selection of Li&#x27;s poems, translated by various translators, is included in John Minford and Joseph S. M. Lau, &quot;Classical Chinese Literature&quot; (2000) For a more recent publication, see the selection of Li Bai&#x27;s poetry in Chinese and in English translation, with biographical context and commentary, in Susan Wan Dolling&#x27;s &quot;My China in Tang Poetry, Book 1: Superstars&quot; (2024).
