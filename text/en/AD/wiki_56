<text>Kakinomoto no Hitomaro (柿本 人麻呂 or 柿本 人麿; – ) was a Japanese &quot;waka&quot; poet and aristocrat of the late Asuka period. He was the most prominent of the poets included in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, the oldest &quot;waka&quot; anthology, but apart from what can be gleaned from hints in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, the details of his life are largely uncertain. He was born to the Kakinomoto clan, based in Yamato Province, probably in the 650s, and likely died in Iwami Province around 709.

He served as court poet to Empress Jitō, creating many works praising the imperial family, and is best remembered for his elegies for various imperial princes. He also composed well-regarded travel poems.

He is ranked as one of the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals. Ōtomo no Yakamochi, the presumed compiler of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, and Ki no Tsurayuki, the principal compiler of the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;, praised Hitomaro as &quot;Sanshi no Mon&quot; (山柿の門) and &quot;Uta no Hijiri&quot; (歌の聖) respectively. From the Heian period on, he was often called Hito-maru (人丸). He has come to be revered as a god of poetry and scholarship, and is considered one of the four greatest poets in Japanese history, along with Fujiwara no Teika, Sōgi and Bashō.

== Life ==
=== Sources ===
The sole early source for the life of the poet Kakinomoto no Hitomaro is the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. His name does not appear in any of the official court documents, perhaps on account of his low rank.

=== Ancestry ===

Hitomaro was born into the Kakinomoto clan, an offshoot of the ancient Wani clan. Centred in the northeastern part of the Nara Basin, the Wani clan had furnished many imperial consorts in the fourth through sixth centuries, and extended their influence from Yamato Province to Yamashiro, Ōmi, Tanba and Harima provinces. Many of their clan traditions (including genealogies, songs, and tales) are preserved in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and, especially, the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. The Kakinomoto clan were headquartered in either Shinjō, Nara or, perhaps more likely, the Ichinomoto area of Tenri, Nara. The main Wani clan were also based in this area, so the Kakinomoto clan may have had a particularly close relationship with their parent clan. According to the &quot;Shinsen Shōjiroku&quot;, the clan&#x27;s name derives from the persimmon (&quot;kaki&quot;) tree that grew on their land during the reign of Emperor Bidatsu.

The Kakinomoto clan had their hereditary title promoted from Omi to Ason in the eleventh month (see &quot;Japanese calendar&quot;) of 684. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Kakinomoto no Saru, the probable head of the clan, had been among ten people appointed &quot;&quot;, equivalent to Junior Fifth Rank, in the twelfth month of 681. These facts lead Watase to conjecture that the Kakinomoto clan may have had some literary success in the court of Emperor Tenmu. According to the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, Saru died in 708, having attained the Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade.

There are several theories regarding the relationship of this Kakinomoto no Saru to the poet Hitomaro, including the former being the latter&#x27;s father, brother, uncle, or them being the same person. The theory that they were the same person has been advanced by Takeshi Umehara, but has little supporting evidence. While the other theories cannot be confirmed, it is certain that they were members of the same clan (probably close relatives), and were active at the same time. It is likely that their mutual activity at court had a significant effect on each other.

=== Birth and early life ===
The year in which he was born is not known, nor can much be said with certainty about any aspects of his life beyond his poetic activities. Watase tentatively takes Hitomaro as being 21 years old (by Japanese reckoning) between 673 and 675, which would put his birth between 653 and 655.

=== Emperor Tenmu&#x27;s reign ===
The earliest dated work attributed to him in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; is his Tanabata poem (&quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; 2033) composed in the ninth year of Emperor Tenmu&#x27;s reign (680). The content of this poem reveals an awareness of the mythology that, according to the preface to the &quot;Kojiki&quot; (completed in 712) had begun to be compiled during Tenmu&#x27;s reign. Watase also observes that Hitomaro&#x27;s having composed a Tanabata poem means that he was probably attending Tanabata gatherings during this period. A significant number of poems in the &quot;Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kashū&quot; were apparently recorded by Hitomaro before 690, and are characteristic of court poetry, leading to the conclusion that he was active at court from the early part of Emperor Tenmu&#x27;s reign. From this point he was active in recording and composing love poems at court.

Watase speculates that Hitomaro came to court in the service of the in response to an imperial edict in 673.

Based on Hitomaro&#x27;s poetic activities during Empress Jitō&#x27;s reign, there are a few possibilities for where Hitomaro was serving at Tenmu&#x27;s court. Watase presents three principal theories: first under the empress-consort Princess Uno-no-sarara (who later became Empress Jitō); second under Crown Prince Kusakabe; third in the palace of Prince Osakabe.

=== Reigns of Empress Jitō and Emperor Monmu ===

Hitomaro acted as a court poet during the reigns of Empress Jitō and Emperor Monmu. In the fourth month of 689, Prince Kusakabe died, and Hitomaro composed an elegy commemorating the prince. He also composed an elegy for Princess Asuka, who died in the fourth month of 700, and a poem commemorating an imperial visit to Kii Province.

His poetic composition flourished during the period in which Empress Jitō was active (both during her reign and after her retirement). He composed poetry for numerous members of the imperial family, including the empress, Prince Kusakabe, Prince Karu, Prince Takechi, Prince Osakabe, Prince Naga, Prince Yuge, Prince Toneri, , Princess Hatsusebe and Princess Asuka. He apparently composed poetry in Yamato Province (his home), Yamashiro Province and Ōmi Province in the north, Kii Province in the south, Shikoku, Kyūshū and the Seto Inland Sea in the west, as well as Iwami Province in the northwest.

Susumu Nakanishi remarks that the fact that he did not apparently compose elegies for emperors themselves, and that most of his poems centre around princes and princesses, indicates that he was probably a writer affiliated with the literary circles that formed around these junior members of the imperial family.

=== Later life and death ===
The ordering of poems, and their headnotes, in volume 2 of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, implies that Hitomaro died shortly before the moving of the capital to Nara in 710. He would have been in Iwami Province, at the Sixth Rank or lower.

The date, site and manner of his death are a matter of scholarly debate, due to some contradictory details that are gleaned from poems attributed to Hitomaro and his wife . Taking Watase&#x27;s rough dates, he would have been in his mid-fifties in 709, when Watase speculates he died. Mokichi Saitō postulated that Hitomaro died in an epidemic that swept Iwami and Izumo provinces in 707. Hitomaro&#x27;s final poem gives the strong impression that he met his death in the mountains.

Saitō was convinced he had located the site of the Kamoyama of the above poem and erected a monument there, but two poems by Yosami that immediately follow the above in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; suggest otherwise, as they mention &quot;shells&quot; (貝 &quot;kai&quot;) and a &quot;Stone River&quot; (石川 &quot;Ishikawa&quot;), neither of which seem likely in the context of Saitō&#x27;s Kamoyama.
The above-quoted translation is based on Saitō&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;kai&quot; as referring to a &quot;ravine&quot; (峡). Other scholars take the presence of &quot;shells&quot; as meaning Hitomaro died near the mouth of a river where it meets the sea. (This interpretation would give the translation &quot;Alas! he lies buried, men say, / With the shells of the Stone River.&quot;)
There is no river named &quot;Ishikawa&quot; near the present Kamoyama; Saitō explained this as &quot;Ishikawa&quot; perhaps being an archaic name for upper part of another river.

An unknown member of the Tajihi clan wrote a response to Yosami in the persona of Hitomaro, very clearly connecting Hitomaro&#x27;s death to the sea.
== Works ==
Hitomaro was a court poet during the reigns of Empress Jitō and Emperor Monmu, with most of his dateable poems coming from the last decade or so of the seventh century. He apparently left a private collection, the so-called &quot;Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kashū&quot;, which does not survive as an independent work but was cited extensively by the compilers of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;.

18 &quot;chōka&quot; and 67 &quot;tanka&quot; (of which 36 are envoys to his long poems) are directly attributed to him in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. All are located in the first four books of the collection. Of these, six &quot;chōka&quot; and 29 &quot;tanka&quot; are classified as &quot;zōka&quot; (miscellaneous poems), three &quot;chōka&quot; and 13 &quot;tanka&quot; as &quot;sōmon&quot; (mutual exchanges of love poetry), and nine &quot;chōka&quot; and 25 &quot;tanka&quot; as &quot;banka&quot; (elegies). Of note is the fact that he contributed &quot;chōka&quot; to all three categories, and that he composed so many &quot;banka&quot;.

Broken down by topic, the above poems include:
*three &quot;chōka&quot; and five &quot;tanka&quot; about reigning emperors, such as hymns praising Empress Jitō&#x27;s visits to Yoshino and , and poems lamenting the fallen Ōmi capital;
*seven &quot;chōka&quot; and 17 &quot;tanka&quot; about imperial princes and princesses such as his elegies for Prince Kusakabe, Prince Takechi, Princess Asuka and and his songs of praise for Prince Karu, Prince Osakabe, Prince Naga and Prince Niitabe;
*seven &quot;chōka&quot; and 28 &quot;tanka&quot; about court women, including the three &quot;tanka&quot; he composed on the court women accompanying Empress Jitō on her visit to Ise while he stayed in the capital, one &quot;chōka&quot; and eight &quot;tanka&quot; mourning Kibitsu no Uneme, Hijikata no Otome and Izumo no Otome, and a number of romantic exchanges with his wife and other lovers;
*one &quot;chōka&quot; and three &quot;tanka&quot; commemorating the bodies of dead people Hitomaro encountered;
*14 &quot;tanka&quot; composed on travel topics that do not fit into any of the above categories (all of which also include travel poems).
From the above it can be said that Hitomaro&#x27;s poetry was primarily about affairs of the court, but that he also showed a marked preference for poems on travel.
In addition to the 85 poems directly attributed to Hitomaro by the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, two &quot;chōka&quot; and three &quot;tanka&quot; in books 3 and 9 are said to be traditionally attributed to Hitomaro. Additionally, there is one Hitomaro &quot;tanka&quot; in book 15 said to have been recited in 736 by an envoy sent to Silla. Including these &quot;traditional&quot; Hitomaro poems, that gives 20 &quot;chōka&quot; and 71 &quot;tanka&quot;. It is quite possible that a significant number of these poems were incorrectly attributed to Hitomaro by tradition. In addition to Hitomaro&#x27;s own compositions, there are also many poems said to have been recorded by him in his personal collection, the &quot;Kakinomoto no Asomi Hitomaro Kashū&quot; (柿本朝臣人麿歌集). The &quot;Hitomaro Kashū&quot; included 333 &quot;tanka&quot;, 35 &quot;sedōka&quot;, and two &quot;chōka&quot;. This adds up to a total figure of close to 500 poems directly associated with Hitomaro.

=== Characteristic style ===
Hitomaro is known for his solemn and mournful elegies of members of the imperial family, whom he described in his courtly poems as &quot;gods&quot; and &quot;children of the sun&quot;. He incorporated elements of the national mythology seen in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and historical narrative in his poetry. While he is known for his poems praising the imperial family, his poetry is also filled with human sensitivity and a new, fresh &quot;folkiness&quot;.

His lament for the Ōmi capital is noted for its vivid, sentimental descriptions of the ruins, while his elegy for Prince Takechi powerfully evokes the Jinshin War. His Yoshino and poems praise splendidly the natural scenery and the divinity of the Japanese islands, and his Iwami exchange vividly describes the powerful emotions of being separated from the woman he loved. His romantic poems convey honest emotions, and his travel poems exquisitely describe the mood of the courtiers on these trips. He shed tears for the deaths of even random commoners on country paths and court women whose names he did not even know.

Watase credits him with the creation of an ancient lyricism that expressed both human sentiment and sincere emotions across both his poems of praise and mourning.

==Reception==

There is evidence that Hitomaro exerted direct influence on the poetry composed during his own time. For example, poems 171 through 193 of Book 1 of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; bear similarities to his work. It is generally accepted that the court poets of the following generation (the so-called &quot;third period&quot; of &quot;Man&#x27;yō&quot; poetry), including Yamabe no Akahito, were influenced by Hitomaro&#x27;s courtly poems. Ōtomo no Yakamochi, a poet of the &quot;fourth period&quot; who probably had a hand in the final compilation of the collection, held Hitomaro in high regard, praising him as &quot;Sanshi no Mon&quot; (山柿の門). As discussed above, the death of Hitomaro appears to have already taken on some legendary characteristics.

In his Japanese preface to the tenth-century &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;, Ki no Tsurayuki referred to Hitomaro as &quot;Uta no Hijiri&quot; (&quot;Saint of Poetry&quot;). In the Heian period the practice of Hitomaru-eigu (人丸影供) also gained currency, showing that Hitomaro had already begun to be apotheosized. Hitomaro&#x27;s divinity status continued to grow in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. The Edo period scholars Keichū and Kamo no Mabuchi tended to reject the various legends about Hitomaro.
In Akashi, Hyōgo Prefecture there is a Kakinomoto Shrine dedicated to him, commemorating an early Heian belief that Hitomaro&#x27;s spirit came to rest in Akashi, an area the historical Hitomaro probably visited multiple times.

Hitomaro is today ranked, along with Fujiwara no Teika, Sōgi and Bashō, as one of the four greatest poets in Japanese history.

<text>Karl Ernst Ritter von Baer Edler von Huthorn (; – ) was a Baltic German scientist and explorer. Baer was a naturalist, biologist, geologist, meteorologist, geographer, and is considered a, or the, founding father of embryology. He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a co-founder of the Russian Geographical Society, and the first president of the Russian Entomological Society, making him one of the most distinguished Baltic German scientists.

==Life==

Karl Ernst von Baer was born into the Baltic German noble Baer family in the Piep Manor , Jerwen County, Governorate of Estonia (in present-day Lääne-Viru County, Estonia), as a knight by birthright. His patrilineal ancestors were of Westphalian origin and originated in Osnabrück. He spent his early childhood at Lasila manor, Estonia. He was educated at the Knight and Cathedral School in Reval (Tallinn) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu). In 1812, during his tenure at the university, he was sent to Riga to aid the city after Napoleon&#x27;s armies had laid siege to it. As he attempted to help the sick and wounded, he realized that his education at Dorpat had been inadequate, and upon his graduation, he notified his father that he would need to go abroad to &quot;finish&quot; his education. In his autobiography, his discontent with his education at Dorpat inspired him to write a lengthy appraisal of education in general, a summary that dominated the content of the book. After leaving Tartu, he continued his education in Berlin, Vienna, and Würzburg, where Ignaz Döllinger introduced him to the new field of embryology.

In 1817, he became a professor at Königsberg University and full professor of zoology in 1821, and of anatomy in 1826. In 1829, he taught briefly in St Petersburg, but returned to Königsberg (Kaliningrad). In 1834, Baer moved back to St Petersburg and joined the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, first in zoology (1834–46) and then in comparative anatomy and physiology (1846–62). His interests while there were anatomy, ichthyology, ethnography, anthropology, and geography. While embryology had kept his attention in Königsberg, then in Russia von Baer engaged in a great deal of field research, including the exploration of the island Novaya Zemlya. The last years of his life (1867–76) were spent in Dorpat, where he became a major critic of Charles Darwin.

==Contributions==

===Embryology===
Von Baer studied the embryonic development of animals, discovering the blastula stage of development and the notochord. Together with Heinz Christian Pander and based on the work by Caspar Friedrich Wolff, he described the germ layer theory of development (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as a principle in a variety of species, laying the foundation for comparative embryology in the book &quot;Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere&quot; (1828). In 1826, Baer discovered the mammalian ovum. The human ovum was first described by Edgar Allen in 1928. In 1827, he completed research &quot;Ovi Mammalium et Hominis genesi&quot; for St Petersburg&#x27;s Academy of Science (published at Leipzig). In 1827 von Baer became the first person to observe human ova. Only in 1876 did Oscar Hertwig prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell.

von Baer formulated what became known as Baer&#x27;s laws of embryology:
# General characteristics of the group to which an embryo belongs develop before special characteristics.
# General structural relations are likewise formed before the most specific appear.
# The form of any given embryo does not converge upon other definite forms, but separates itself from them.
# The embryo of a higher animal form never resembles the adult of another animal form, such as one less evolved, but only its embryo.

===Permafrost research===
Baer was a genius scientist covering not only the topics of embryology and ethnology, he also was especially interested in the geography of the northern parts of Russia, and explored Novaya Zemlya in 1837. In these arctic environments, he was studying periglacial features, permafrost occurrences, and collecting biological specimens. Other travels led him to subarctic regions of the North Cape and Lapland, but also to the Caspian Sea. He was one of the founders of the Russian Geographical Society.

Thanks to Baer&#x27;s research expeditions, the scientific investigation of permafrost began in Russia. Baer recorded the importance of permafrost research even before 1837 when observing in detail the geothermal gradient from a 116.7 m deep shaft in Yakutsk. At the end of the 1830s, he recommended sending expeditions to explore permafrost in Siberia and suggested Alexander von Middendorff as leader. Baer&#x27;s expedition instructions written for Middendorff comprised over 200 pages. Baer summarized his knowledge in 1842/43 in a print-ready typescript. The German title is „Materialien zur Kenntniss des unvergänglichen Boden-Eises in Sibirien“ (=materials for the knowledge of the perennial ground ice in Siberia). This world&#x27;s first permafrost textbook was conceived as a complete work for printing. But it remained lost for more than 150 years. However, from 1838 onwards, Baer published a larger number of small publications on permafrost. Numerous of Baer&#x27;s papers on permafrost were already published as early as 1837 and 1838. Well known was his paper &quot;On the Ground Ice or Frozen Soil of Siberia&quot;, published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London (1838, pp. 210–213) and reprinted 1839 in the American Journal of Sciences and Arts by S. Silliman. There are many other publications and small notes on permafrost by Baer, as shown in the Karl Ernst von Baer museum in Tartu (Estonia), now part of the Estonian University of Life Sciences.

There are quite a number of studies in Russian about the origin of permafrost research. Russian authors usually relate with it the name Alexander von Middendorff (1815–1894), as he did much scientific work during the years 1842–1845 concerning permafrost on Taimyr Peninsula and in East-Siberia. However, Russian scientists during the 1940s also realized, that it was K. E. Baer who initiated this expedition and that the origin of scientific permafrost research must be fixed with Baer&#x27;s thorough earlier scientific work. They even believed, that the scepticism about the permafrost findings and publications of Middendorff would not have risen, if Baer&#x27;s original &quot;materials for the study of the perennial ground-ice&quot; would have been published in 1842 as intended. This was realized also by the Russian Academy of Sciences that honoured Baer with the publication of a tentative Russian translation done already in 1842 by Sumgin. These facts were completely forgotten until after the Second World War.

In North America, permafrost research started after the Second World War with the creation of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), a division of the US army. It was realized that the understanding of frozen ground and permafrost are essential factors in strategic northern areas during the Cold War. In the Soviet Union, the Melnikov Permafrost Institute in Yakutsk had similar aims. The first post-World War major contact between groups of senior Russian and American frozen ground researchers took place in November 1963 in Yakutsk.However, Baer&#x27;s permafrost textbook remained still undiscovered.

Thus in 2001 the discovery and annotated publication of the typescript from 1843 in the library archives of the University of Giessen was a scientific sensation. The full text of Baer&#x27;s work is available online (234 pages). The editor Lorenz King added to the facsimile reprint a preface in English, two colour permafrost maps of Eurasia and some figures of permafrost features. Baer&#x27;s text is introduced with detailed comments and references on additional 66 pages written by the Estonian historian Erki Tammiksaar.

The work is fascinating to read, because both Baer&#x27;s observations on permafrost distribution and his periglacial morphological descriptions are largely still correct today. He distinguished between &quot;continental&quot; and &quot;insular&quot; permafrost, saw the temporary existence of permafrost and postulated the formation and further development of permafrost as a result of the complex physio-geographical, geological and floristic site conditions. With his permafrost classification Baer laid the foundation for the modern permafrost terminology of the International Permafrost Association. With his compilation and analysis of all available data on ground ice and permafrost, Karl Ernst von Baer must be given the attribute &quot;founder of scientific permafrost research&quot;.

===Evolution===

From his studies of comparative embryology, Baer had believed in the transmutation of species but rejected later in his career the theory of natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin. He produced an early tree-like branching diagram illustrating the sequential origins of derived character states in vertebrate embryos during ontogeny that implies a pattern of phylogenetic relationship.

In the fifth edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; published in 1869, Charles Darwin added a &quot;Historical Sketch&quot; giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin:

:&quot;Von Baer, towards whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect, expressed about the year 1859... his conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution, that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single parent-form.&quot; He was a pioneer in studying biological time – the perception of time in different organisms.

Baer believed in a teleological force in nature which directed evolution (orthogenesis).

===Other topics===

The term Baer&#x27;s law is also applied to the unconfirmed proposition that in the Northern Hemisphere, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks. In its more thorough formulation, which Baer never formulated himself, the erosion of rivers depends on the direction of flow, as well. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a section of river flowing in a north–south direction, according to the theory, erodes on its right bank due to the coriolis effect, while in an east–west section there is no preference. However, this was repudiated by Albert Einstein&#x27;s tea leaf paradox.

==Awards and distinctions==

In 1849, he was elected a foreign honorary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1850. He was the president of the Estonian Naturalists&#x27; Society in 1869–1876, and was a co-founder and first president of the Russian Entomological Society. In 1875, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Legacy==

A statue honouring him can be found on Toome Hill in Tartu, as well as at Lasila manor, Estonia, and at the Zoological Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. In Tartu, there is also located Baer House which also functions as Baer Museum.

Before the Estonian conversion to the euro, the 2-kroon bank note bore his portrait. Baer Island in the Kara Sea was named after Karl Ernst von Baer for his important contributions to the research of arctic meteorology between 1830 and 1840. A duck, Baer&#x27;s pochard, was also named after him.

<text>The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were political statements drafted in 1798 and 1799 in which the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures took the position that the federal Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional. The resolutions argued that the states had the right and the duty to declare unconstitutional those acts of Congress that the Constitution did not authorize. In doing so, they argued for states&#x27; rights and strict construction of the Constitution. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 were written secretly by Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively.

The principles stated in the resolutions became known as the &quot;Principles of &#x27;98&quot;. Adherents argued that the states could judge the constitutionality of federal government laws and decrees. The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 argued that each individual state has the power to declare that federal laws are unconstitutional and void. The Kentucky Resolution of 1799 added that when the states determine that a law is unconstitutional, nullification by the states is the proper remedy. The Virginia Resolutions of 1798 refer to &quot;interposition&quot; to express the idea that the states have a right to &quot;interpose&quot; to prevent harm caused by unconstitutional laws. The Virginia Resolutions contemplated joint action by the states.

The Resolutions were produced primarily as campaign material for the 1800 United States presidential election and had been controversial since their passage, eliciting disapproval from ten state legislatures. Ron Chernow assessed the theoretical damage of the resolutions as &quot;deep and lasting ... a recipe for disunion&quot;. George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if &quot;systematically and pertinaciously pursued&quot;, they would &quot;dissolve the union or produce coercion&quot;. Their influence reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. In the years leading up to the Nullification Crisis, the resolutions divided Jeffersonian democrats, with states&#x27; rights proponents such as John C. Calhoun supporting the Principles of &#x27;98 and President Andrew Jackson opposing them. Years later, the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 led anti-slavery activists to quote the Resolutions to support their calls on Northern states to nullify what they considered unconstitutional enforcement of the law.

==Provisions of the Resolutions==
The resolutions opposed the federal Alien and Sedition Acts, which extended the powers of the federal government. They argued that the Constitution was a &quot;compact&quot; or agreement among the states. Therefore, the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it. If the federal government assumed such powers, its acts could be declared unconstitutional by the states. So, states could decide the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress. Kentucky&#x27;s Resolution 1 stated:

That the several states composing the United States of America are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government; but that, by compact, under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States, and of amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for special purposes, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each state to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government; and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party, its co-States forming, as to itself, the other party; that this government, created by this compact, was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself, since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.

A key provision of the Kentucky Resolutions was Resolution 2, which denied Congress more than a few penal powers by arguing that Congress had no authority to punish crimes other than those specifically named in the Constitution. The Alien and Sedition Acts were asserted to be unconstitutional, and therefore void, because they dealt with crimes not mentioned in the Constitution:

That the Constitution of the United States, having delegated to Congress a power to punish treason, counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States, piracies, and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations, and no other crimes, whatsoever; and it being true as a general principle, and one of the amendments to the Constitution having also declared, that &quot;the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people,&quot; therefore the act of Congress, passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and intitled &quot;An Act in addition to the act intitled An Act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,&quot; as also the act passed by them on the—day of June, 1798, intitled &quot;An Act to punish frauds committed on the bank of the United States,&quot; (and all their other acts which assume to create, define, or punish crimes, other than those so enumerated in the Constitution,) are altogether void, and of no force whatsoever.

The Virginia Resolution of 1798 also relied on the compact theory and asserted that the states have the right to determine whether actions of the federal government exceed constitutional limits. The Virginia Resolution introduced the idea that the states may &quot;interpose&quot; when the federal government acts unconstitutionally, in their opinion:

That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the federal government as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties, as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact, as no further valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact; and that, in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states, who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties, appertaining to them.

==History of the Resolutions==
There were two sets of Kentucky Resolutions. The Kentucky General Assembly passed the first resolution on November 16, 1798, and the second on December 3, 1799. Jefferson wrote the 1798 Resolutions. The author of the 1799 Resolutions is not known with certainty. Both resolutions were stewarded by John Breckinridge who was falsely believed to have been their author.

James Madison wrote the Virginia Resolution. The Virginia General Assembly passed it on December 24, 1798.

The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 stated that acts of the national government beyond the scope of its constitutional powers are &quot;unauthoritative, void, and of no force&quot;. While Jefferson&#x27;s draft of the 1798 Resolutions had claimed that each state has a right of &quot;nullification&quot; of unconstitutional laws, that language did not appear in the final form of those Resolutions. Rather than purporting to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts, the 1798 Resolutions called on the other states to join Kentucky &quot;in declaring these acts void and of no force&quot; and &quot;in requesting their repeal at the next session of Congress&quot;.

The Kentucky Resolutions of 1799 were written to respond to the states who had rejected the 1798 Resolutions. The 1799 Resolutions used the term &quot;nullification&quot;, which had been deleted from Jefferson&#x27;s draft of the 1798 Resolutions, resolving: &quot;That the several states who formed [the Constitution], being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction; and, That a nullification, by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy.&quot; The 1799 Resolutions did not assert that Kentucky would unilaterally refuse to enforce the Alien and Sedition Acts. Rather, the 1799 Resolutions declared that Kentucky &quot;will bow to the laws of the Union&quot; but would continue &quot;to oppose in a constitutional manner&quot; the Alien and Sedition Acts. The 1799 Resolutions concluded by stating that Kentucky was entering its &quot;solemn protest&quot; against those Acts.

The Virginia Resolution did not refer to &quot;nullification&quot;, but instead used the idea of &quot;interposition&quot; by the states. The Resolution stated that when the national government acts beyond the scope of the Constitution, the states &quot;have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties, appertaining to them&quot;. The Virginia Resolution did not indicate what form this &quot;interposition&quot; might take or what effect it would have. The Virginia Resolutions appealed to the other states for agreement and cooperation.
Numerous scholars (including Koch and Ammon) have noted that Madison had the words &quot;void, and of no force or effect&quot; excised from the Virginia Resolutions before adoption. Madison later explained that he did this because an individual state does not have the right to declare a federal law null and void. Rather, Madison explained that &quot;interposition&quot; involved a collective action of the states, not a refusal by an individual state to enforce federal law, and that the deletion of the words &quot;void, and of no force or effect&quot; was intended to make clear that no individual state could nullify federal law.

The Kentucky Resolutions of 1799, while claiming the right of nullification, did not assert that individual states could exercise that right. Rather, nullification was described as an action to be taken by &quot;the several states&quot; who formed the Constitution. The Kentucky Resolutions thus ended up proposing joint action, as did the Virginia Resolution.

The Resolutions joined the foundational beliefs of Jefferson&#x27;s party and were used as party documents in the 1800 election. As they had been shepherded to passage in the Virginia House of Delegates by John Taylor of Caroline, they became part of the heritage of the &quot;Old Republicans&quot;. Taylor rejoiced in what the House of Delegates had made of Madison&#x27;s draft: it had read the claim that the Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional as meaning that they had &quot;no force or effect&quot; in Virginia—that is, that they were void. Future Virginia Governor and U.S. Secretary of War James Barbour concluded that &quot;unconstitutional&quot; included &quot;void, and of no force or effect&quot;, and that Madison&#x27;s textual change did not affect the meaning. Madison himself strongly denied this reading of the Resolution.

The long-term importance of the Resolutions lies not in their attack on the Alien and Sedition Acts, but rather in their strong statements of states&#x27; rights theory, which led to the rather different concepts of nullification and interposition.

===Responses of other states===

The resolutions were submitted to the other states for approval, but with no success. Seven states formally responded to Kentucky and Virginia by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state affirmed the resolutions. At least six states responded to the Resolutions by taking the position that the constitutionality of acts of Congress is a question for the federal courts, not the state legislatures. For example, Vermont&#x27;s resolution stated: &quot;It belongs not to state legislatures to decide on the constitutionality of laws made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested in the judiciary courts of the Union.&quot; In New Hampshire, newspapers treated them as military threats and replied with foreshadowings of civil war. &quot;We think it highly probable that Virginia and Kentucky will be sadly disappointed in their infernal plan of exciting insurrections and tumults,&quot; proclaimed one. The state legislature&#x27;s unanimous reply was blunt:

Alexander Hamilton, then building up the army, suggested sending it into Virginia, on some &quot;obvious pretext&quot;. Measures would be taken, Hamilton hinted to an ally in Congress, &quot;to act upon the laws and put Virginia to the Test of resistance&quot;. At the Virginia General Assembly, delegate John Mathews was said to have objected to the passing of the resolutions by &quot;tearing them into pieces and trampling them underfoot.&quot;

===The Report of 1800===
In January 1800, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Report of 1800, a document written by Madison to respond to criticism of the Virginia Resolution by other states. The Report of 1800 reviewed and affirmed each part of the Virginia Resolution, affirming that the states have the right to declare that a federal action is unconstitutional. The Report went on to assert that a declaration of unconstitutionality by a state would be an expression of opinion, without legal effect. The purpose of such a declaration, said Madison, was to mobilize public opinion and to elicit cooperation from other states. Madison indicated that the power to make binding constitutional determinations remained in the federal courts:

Madison then argued that a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by communicating with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention.

However, in the same document Madison explicitly argued that the states retain the ultimate power to decide about the constitutionality of the federal laws, in &quot;extreme cases&quot; such as the Alien and Sedition Act. The Supreme Court can decide in the last resort only in those cases which pertain to the acts of other branches of the federal government, but cannot takeover the ultimate decision-making power from the states which are the &quot;sovereign parties&quot; in the Constitutional compact. According to Madison states could override not only the Congressional acts, but also the decisions of the Supreme Court:

:The resolution supposes that dangerous powers, not delegated, may not only be usurped and executed by the other departments, but that the judicial department, also, may exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the grant of the Constitution; and, consequently, that the ultimate right of the parties to the Constitution, to judge whether the compact has been dangerously violated, must extend to violations by one delegated authority as well as by another—by the judiciary as well as by the executive, or the legislature.

:However true, therefore, it may be, that the judicial department is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities of the other departments of the government; not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from which the judicial, as well as the other departments, hold their delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power would annul the authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped powers, might subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very Constitution which all were instituted to preserve.

Madison later strongly denied that individual states have the right to nullify federal law.

==Influence of the Resolutions==

Although the New England states rejected the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798–99, several years later, the state governments of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island threatened to ignore the Embargo Act of 1807 based on the authority of states to stand up to laws deemed by those states to be unconstitutional. Rhode Island justified its position on the embargo act based on the explicit language of interposition. However, none of these states actually passed a resolution nullifying the Embargo Act. Instead, they challenged it in court, appealed to Congress for its repeal, and proposed several constitutional amendments.

Several years later, Massachusetts and Connecticut asserted their right to test constitutionality when instructed to send their militias to defend the coast during the War of 1812. Connecticut and Massachusetts questioned another embargo passed in 1813. Both states objected, including this statement from the Massachusetts legislature, or General Court:

Massachusetts and Connecticut, along with representatives of some other New England states, held a convention in 1814 that issued a statement asserting the right of interposition. But the statement did not attempt to nullify federal law. Rather, it made an appeal to Congress to provide for the defense of New England and proposed several constitutional amendments.

===The Nullification Crisis===

During the &quot;nullification crisis&quot; of 1828–1833, South Carolina passed an purporting to nullify two federal tariff laws. South Carolina asserted that the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832 were beyond the authority of the Constitution, and therefore were &quot;null, void, and no law, nor binding upon this State, its officers or citizens&quot;. Andrew Jackson issued a proclamation against the doctrine of nullification, stating: &quot;I consider ... the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.&quot; He also denied the right to secede: &quot;The Constitution ... forms a government not a league. ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation.&quot;

James Madison also opposed South Carolina&#x27;s position on nullification. Madison argued that he had never intended his Virginia Resolution to suggest that each individual state had the power to nullify an act of Congress. Madison wrote: &quot;But it follows, from no view of the subject, that a nullification of a law of the U. S. can as is now contended, belong rightfully to a single State, as one of the parties to the Constitution; the State not ceasing to avow its adherence to the Constitution. A plainer contradiction in terms, or a more fatal inlet to anarchy, cannot be imagined.&quot; Madison explained that when the Virginia Legislature passed the Virginia Resolution, the &quot;interposition&quot; it contemplated was &quot;a concurring and cooperating interposition of the States, not that of a single State. ... [T]he Legislature expressly disclaimed the idea that a declaration of a State, that a law of the U. S. was unconstitutional, had the effect of annulling the law.&quot; Madison went on to argue that the purpose of the Virginia Resolution had been to elicit cooperation by the other states in seeking change through means provided in the Constitution, such as an amendment.

===The compact theory===

The Supreme Court rejected the compact theory in several nineteenth century cases, undermining the basis for the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. In cases such as &quot;Martin v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee&quot;, &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;, and &quot;Texas v. White&quot;, the Court asserted that the Constitution was established directly by the people, rather than being a compact among the states. Abraham Lincoln also rejected the compact theory saying the Constitution was a binding contract among the states and no contract can be changed unilaterally by one party.

===School desegregation===

In 1954, the Supreme Court decided &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which ruled that segregated schools violate the Constitution. Many people in southern states strongly opposed the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. James J. Kilpatrick, an editor of the &quot;Richmond News Leader&quot;, wrote a series of editorials urging &quot;massive resistance&quot; to integration of the schools. Kilpatrick, relying on the Virginia Resolution, revived the idea of interposition by the states as a constitutional basis for resisting federal government action. A number of southern states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Virginia, and Florida, subsequently passed interposition and nullification laws in an effort to prevent integration of their schools.

In the case of &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot;, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Arkansas&#x27; effort to use nullification and interposition. The Supreme Court held that under the Supremacy Clause, federal law was controlling and the states did not have the power to evade the application of federal law. The Court specifically rejected the contention that Arkansas&#x27; legislature and governor had the power to nullify the &quot;Brown&quot; decision.

In a similar case arising from Louisiana&#x27;s interposition act, &quot;Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board&quot;, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of a federal district court that rejected interposition. The district court stated: &quot;The conclusion is clear that interposition is not a constitutional doctrine. If taken seriously, it is illegal defiance of constitutional authority. Otherwise, &#x27;it amounted to no more than a protest, an escape valve through which the legislators blew off steam to relieve their tensions.&#x27; ... However solemn or spirited, interposition resolutions have no legal efficacy.&quot;

==Importance of the Resolutions==
Merrill Peterson, Jefferson&#x27;s otherwise very favorable biographer, emphasizes the negative long-term impact of the Resolutions, calling them &quot;dangerous&quot; and a product of &quot;hysteria&quot;:

Jefferson&#x27;s biographer Dumas Malone argued that the Kentucky resolution might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time. In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, &quot;unless arrested at the threshold&quot;, the Alien and Sedition Acts would &quot;necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood.&quot; Historian Ron Chernow says of this &quot;he wasn&#x27;t calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president.&quot; Jefferson &quot;thus set forth a radical doctrine of states&#x27; rights that effectively undermined the constitution.&quot; Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves. Historian Garry Wills argued &quot;Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure&quot;. The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was &quot;deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion&quot;. George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if &quot;systematically and pertinaciously pursued&quot;, they would &quot;dissolve the union or produce coercion&quot;. The influence of Jefferson&#x27;s doctrine of states&#x27; rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. Future president James Garfield, at the close of the Civil War, said that Jefferson&#x27;s Kentucky Resolution &quot;contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits&quot;.

<text>The Keystone Cops (often spelled &quot;Keystone Kops&quot;) are fictional, humorously incompetent policemen featured in silent film slapstick comedies produced by Mack Sennett for his Keystone Film Company between 1912 and 1917.

==History==
Hank Mann created the Keystone Cops, and they were named for the Keystone studio, the film production company founded in 1912 by Sennett. Their first film was &quot;Hoffmeyer&#x27;s Legacy&quot; (1912), with Mann playing the part of police chief Tehiezel, but their popularity stemmed from the 1913 short &quot;The Bangville Police&quot; starring Mabel Normand.


As early as 1914, Sennett shifted the Keystone Cops from starring roles to background ensemble in support of comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle. 

The Keystone Cops served as supporting players for Chaplin, Marie Dressler and Mabel Normand in the first full-length Sennett comedy feature &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; (1914); &quot;Mabel&#x27;s New Hero&quot; (1913) with Normand and Arbuckle; &quot;Making a Living&quot; (1914) with Chaplin in his first pre-Tramp screen appearance; &quot;In the Clutches of the Gang&quot; (1914) with Normand, Arbuckle, and Al St. John; and &quot;Wished on Mabel&quot; (1915) with Arbuckle and Normand, among others. 

Comic actors Chester Conklin, Jimmy Finlayson, and Ford Sterling were also Keystone Cops, as was director Del Lord.

The original Keystone Cops were George Jeske, Bobby Dunn, Mack Riley, Charles Avery, Slim Summerville, Edgar Kennedy, and Hank Mann. In 2010, the lost short &quot;A Thief Catcher&quot; was discovered at an antique sale in Michigan. It was filmed in 1914 and stars Ford Sterling, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, and Al St. John and includes a previously unknown appearance of Charlie Chaplin as a Keystone Cop.

== Revivals ==
Mack Sennett continued to use the Keystone Cops intermittently through the 1920s, but their popularity had waned by the time that sound films arrived. In 1935, director Ralph Staub staged a revival of the Sennett gang for his Warner Brothers short subject &quot;Keystone Hotel&quot;, featuring a re-creation of the Kops clutching at their hats, leaping in the air in surprise, running energetically in any direction, and taking extreme pratfalls. The Staub version of the Keystone Cops became a template for later re-creations. 20th Century Fox&#x27;s 1939 film &quot;Hollywood Cavalcade&quot; had Buster Keaton in a Keystone chase scene. &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops&quot; (1955) included a lengthy chase scene, showcasing a group of stuntmen dressed as Sennett&#x27;s squad. (Two original Keystone Cops in this film were Heinie Conklin as an elderly studio guard and Hank Mann as a prop man. Sennett also starred in a cameo appearance as himself).

Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) has a scene in which the Beatles are chased around the streets by police in the manner of the Keystone Cops.

In Sydney, Australia, in the 1960s, Rod Hull, Desmond Tester and Penny Spence featured in a local homage series of TV comedy shorts, &quot;Caper Cops&quot;. &quot;It’s a direct steal of the American &quot;Keystone Kops&quot; [sic], but this is Sydney, Australia, in the late 1960s and who cares...&quot; said creator/star Hull.

Mel Brooks directed a car chase scene in the Keystone Cops&#x27; style in his comedy film &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976).

=== Canceled cartoon shorts ===
In the late 1960s, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts pitched to create a series of animated cartoon short films based on the Keystone Cops, before being scrapped permanently following the closure of Warner’s original animation studio in 1969.

== In popular culture ==
The name has since been used to criticize any group for its mistakes and lack of coordination, particularly if either trait was exhibited after a great deal of energy and activity. For example, in criticizing the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s response to Hurricane Katrina, Senator Joseph Lieberman claimed that emergency workers under DHS chief Michael Chertoff &quot;ran around like Keystone Kops, uncertain about what they were supposed to do or uncertain how to do it.&quot;

In sport, the term has come into common usage by television commentators, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The rugby commentator Liam Toland uses the term to describe a team&#x27;s incompetent performance on the pitch. The phrase &quot;Keystone Cops defending&quot; has become a catchphrase for describing a situation in an English football match where a defensive error or a series of defensive errors leads to a goal. The term was also used in American Football commentary to describe the play of the New York Jets against the New England Patriots in the 2012 Butt Fumble game, with sportscaster Cris Collinsworth declaring &quot;This is the Keystone Cops&quot;, after the Jets gave up 21 points in 51 seconds.

According to Dave Filoni, supervising director of the animated television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, the look of the GU-series Guardian police droids is based on the appearance of the Keystone Cops.

The 1983 video game &quot;Keystone Kapers&quot;, released for the Atari 2600, 5200, MSX and Colecovision, by Activision, featured Officer Keystone Kelly.

The open-source 1987 video game &quot;NetHack&quot; features Keystone Cops as a type of enemy, appearing whenever a player steals from an in-game shop.

<text>Koenigsegg Automotive AB () is a Swedish manufacturer of high-performance sports cars based in Ängelholm, Skåne County, Sweden.

Koenigsegg cars have on several occasions broken various production car speed records.

==Company==

The company was founded in 1994 in Sweden by Christian von Koenigsegg, with the intention of producing a &quot;world-class&quot; sports car. Many years of development and testing led to the CC8S, the company&#x27;s first street-legal production car, which was introduced in 2002.

In 2006, Koenigsegg began production of the CCX, which uses an engine created in-house specifically for the car. The goal was to develop a car homologated for use worldwide, particularly the United States whose strict regulations did not allow the import of earlier Koenigsegg models.

In March 2009, the CCXR was listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one of &quot;the world&#x27;s most beautiful cars&quot;.

In December 2010, the Agera won the BBC Top Gear Hypercar of the Year Award.

Apart from developing, manufacturing and selling the Koenigsegg line of sports cars, Koenigsegg is also involved in &quot;green technology&quot; development programmes beginning with the CCXR (&quot;Flower Power&quot;) flex-fuel sports car and continuing through the present with the Jesko. Koenigsegg is also active in development programs of plug-in electric cars&#x27; systems and next-generation reciprocating engine technologies. Koenigsegg has also developed a camless piston engine which found its first application in the Gemera, which was introduced in 2020.

Koenigsegg develops and produces most of the main systems, subsystems and components needed for its cars in-house instead of relying on subcontractors.

In January 2019, Koenigsegg sold a 20% stake in the company to Swedish electric car manufacturer (Egstrand &amp; Lundgren), National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), for .

Koenigsegg has since then bought the stake back from NEVS in 2021 and owns 100% of the company again.

In mid-2023, Koenigsegg inaugurated a new factory, engineering and R&amp;D facilities and a showroom in Ängelholm.

==History==
===Factory history===

Christian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated movie &quot;The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix&quot; in his youth. At 22 years old, Koenigsegg gathered from investors and founded Koenigsegg Automotive in 1994.

Initially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in Olofström. In the early 2000s, the company moved to Ängelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active Ängelholm airport. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.

In July 2023 Koenigsegg opened a newly built factory, close to the old factory building in Ängeholm, doubling the production capacity.

===Prototypes and production===
The initial design of the CC was penned down by Christian von Koenigsegg. Industrial designer David Crafoord realised the sketches as a 1:5 scale model. This model was later scaled up in order to create the base plug for the initial Koenigsegg prototype that was finished in 1996. During the next years, the prototype went through extensive testing and several new prototypes were built. The prototypes initially used an Audi V8 engine but after the engine supply contract fell through, the next candidate was the Flat-12 race engine developed by Motori Moderni for the Scuderia Coloni Formula one team, in which this engine was raced under the Subaru badge in the 1990 season. These Subaru 1235 engines were purchased and modified for use in the CC; this deal failed when the founder of Motori Moderni died, sending the company into bankruptcy.

Koenigsegg developed its own engine based on the Ford Modular architecture in 2012. It later developed its own engines from scratch, including control systems and transmissions, which is very unusual for a small size sports car producer.

=== Badge ===

The Koenigsegg badge was designed in 1994 by Jacob Låftman, based on the heraldic coat of arms of the von Koenigsegg family. The shield has been the family&#x27;s coat of arms since the 12th century when a family member was knighted by the Holy Roman Empire.

=== Ghost Badge ===
After moving into the abandoned airfield, which once housed a Swedish Air Force squadron, Koenigsegg adopted the &quot;ghost symbol&quot; that the squadron had on its planes as a tribute. The badge is seen on models built in the factory that was converted from its hangar.

===Attempted purchase of Saab===
On 12 June 2009, the media reported that Koenigsegg Group, consisting of Koenigsegg Automotive AB, Christian von Koenigsegg, Bård Eker and a group of investors led by Mark Bishop had signed a letter of intent with Saab to take over the brand from General Motors. General Motors confirmed on 16 June that they had chosen Koenigsegg Group as the buyer of Saab Automobile. The deal, set to close 30 September 2009, included in financing from the European Investment Bank, guaranteed by the Swedish government. By comparison, in 2008 Koenigsegg with its staff of 45 produced 18 cars at an average price of ; Saab employed 3,400 workers and made more than 93,000 cars.

General Motors announced on 18 August that the deal had been signed, although certain financing details remained to be completed. On 9 September 2009, Koenigsegg announced that BAIC was going to join as a minority stakeholder in Koenigsegg.

In November 2009, Koenigsegg decided not to finalise the purchase of Saab and therefore left the negotiations. Koenigsegg stated that its decision was due to the uncertain timing of finalisation of the takeover.

==Models==
A Koenigsegg CC prototype was first publicised in 1996, while the full carbon fibre production prototype having white paintwork was finally unveiled at the 2000 Paris Motor Show. Stephan Reeckmann became the first customer of the brand, placing a deposit in 2001. Another customer took delivery of a red CC8S in 2002 at the Geneva Auto Show and four more cars were built that year. Koenigsegg was established in Asia later that year with a premiere at the Seoul Auto Show. In 2004, the new CCR, which was basically a high performance variant of the CC8S, was unveiled at the Geneva Auto Show; only 14 were produced.

In 2006, Koenigsegg introduced the CCX, a new model, that was developed in order to meet worldwide regulations for road use. This meant the car had to go through extensive development in order to meet the latest and most stringent safety and emission standards that the world&#x27;s authorities demanded; Koenigsegg had to, for example, develop its own engines and other related technologies.

In 2007, Koenigsegg premiered the CCXR, a biofuel/flex-fuel version of the CCX. The car features a modified engine, fuel system, and engine management system that enables the car to run on normal gasoline or ethanol, and in any mixture between these two fuels. Ethanol has a higher octane rating compared to regular fuel.

In 2009, Koenigsegg released information about a special edition car called the &quot;Trevita&quot;, of which three were planned to be made but only two were finished due to technical problems. The &quot;Trevita&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;three whites&quot;, has a body made entirely of Koenigsegg&#x27;s proprietary material consisting of diamond-coated carbon fibre. The &quot;Trevita&quot; is based on the CCXR, and therefore has a power output of when running on biofuel.
In 2010 Koenigsegg released information at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show about a new model called the Agera, which translates into English as &quot;take action/act&quot;. The Agera features a Koenigsegg developed 5.0-litre V8 engine coupled with variable turbo geometry turbochargers having a power output of , mated to a newly developed 7-speed dual clutch transmission. The Agera&#x27;s design follows a clear lineage from the previous Koenigsegg sports cars, but adds many special new features, such as a wider front track, new styling and aerodynamic features, and a new interior; including a new lighting technique called &quot;Ghost Light&quot; by the manufacturer which consists of microscopic holes to hide the interior lighting until it is turned on, which then shines through what appears to be solid aluminium. Production of the Agera ended in July 2018 after being in production for eight years when two of the three final edition cars were presented to its customers.

At the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, Koenigsegg presented a new model named the &quot;Regera&quot;, which translates into English as to &quot;reign&quot; or &quot;rule&quot;. The Regera uses the Koenigsegg Direct Drive (KDD) transmission. Below , motive power is by two electric motors on the rear wheels and the internal combustion engine (ICE) is disconnected. Above , the ICE is connected by a fixed ratio transmission with no gearbox, torque vectoring by the previously mentioned electric motors and boosted by a third electric motor attached to the driveshaft.

Koenigsegg initially based its engine on a V8 engine block from Ford Racing. These engines powered the initial run of the CC monikered cars. The block for the V8 in the CCX (Competition Coupe Ten, to celebrate ten years of the company) was cast for Koenigsegg by Grainger &amp; Worrall of the UK who also cast the block for the Agera&#x27;s 5.0-litre engine.

In late 2018, Koenigsegg showed potential customers in Australia the replacement of the Agera via VR. Teaser sketches were released by the company at the same time. Initially, the model was rumoured to be called &quot;Ragnarok&quot; but the public unveil of the car at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show revealed the name to be Jesko, after the founder&#x27;s father Jesko von Koenigsegg.

The Jesko uses a development of the 5.0-litre V8 engine used in the Agera which has a power output of on normal gasoline and has a power output of and of torque at 5,100 rpm on E85 biofuel. The engine is mated to a 9-speed multi-clutch transmission having seven clutches called the &quot;Light Speed Transmission&quot; (LST) by the manufacturer. The focus of this transmission is to have faster shift times. The car will come in either a high-downforce, track-oriented or a low-drag, high speed Absolut variant.

On 3 March 2020, the Gemera was unveiled on an online broadcast. It is scheduled to be released to the public in 2022. There will be a limited production of 300 units. This will be Koenigsegg&#x27;s first four-seater vehicle. The vehicle is powered by a small engine called the Koenigsegg TFG (Tiny Friendly Giant). The car also features full-length Koenigsegg Automated Twisted Synchrohelix Actuation Doors (KATSAD).

==Records==
On 28 February 2005, at 12:08 pm local time, in Nardò, Italy, the CCR broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest production car in the world, having attained on the Nardò Ring (a circular track of circumference), breaking the record previously held by the McLaren F1.
It held the record until September 2005 when the Bugatti Veyron broke the record again by attaining a speed of , proven both by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; and &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Both of the records set by Bugatti and McLaren were set on Volkswagen&#x27;s own test-track Ehra-Lessien, which features a straight.

In 2008 the German magazine &quot;sport auto&quot; conducted a test for production cars, with the CCX winning the event in a total time of . The CCX also accelerated from 0–200 km/h in 9.3 seconds.

In September 2011, the Agera R broke the Guinness World Record for 0–300 km/h with a time of 14.53 seconds and a 0–300–0 km/h time of 21.19 seconds. Koenigsegg improved this record with the One:1 on 8 June 2015. It attained 0–300 km/h in 11.92 seconds and 0–300–0 km/h in 17.95 seconds (a 3.24 sec improvement over the 2011 Koenigsegg Agera R record), it also attained 0–322 km/h (0–200 mph) in 14.328 seconds and 0–322–0 km/h in 20.71 seconds.

On 1 October 2017, an Agera RS set an unofficial record for with a time of 36.44 seconds. The record was set at the Vandel Airfield in Denmark and broke the record of 42 seconds set by the Bugatti Chiron a few weeks prior.

On 4 November 2017, an Agera RS set a new record for the world&#x27;s fastest production car with an average speed of with Koenigsegg test driver Niklas Lilja behind the wheel. The record breaking run was done on a closed section of Nevada State Route 160 in Pahrump, Nevada, United States. On the same day they also beat its own 0–400–0 km/h record they set a few weeks prior (33.29 seconds compared to the old record of 36.44 seconds). It was later confirmed via the instrumentation that the car topped out at 457.94 km/h (284.55 mph).

On 23 September 2019, Koenigsegg set a new 0–400–0 km/h world record when a Koenigsegg Regera completed the run in 31.49 seconds. This was 1.8 seconds faster than Koenigsegg&#x27;s previously unbeaten record, set by the Agera RS in 2017.

On 16 June 2023, the Regera again broke the 0–400–0 km/h acceleration record with an improved time of 28.81 seconds. The new record attempt came one month after the Regera&#x27;s first record was broken by the Rimac Nevera, which achieved a time of 29.93 seconds. The record was set at Örebro Airport by Koenigsegg development driver Markus Lundh, who cited improvements in the track surface and the new Michelin Cup 2 R tyres as reasons for the faster run.

Over the new record run, the car accelerated from 0–400 km/h in 20.68 seconds over a distance of and decelerated to a controlled stop in 8.13 seconds over a distance of . The total distance used for the record was .

On 18 August 2024, the Jesko Attack set the production car lap record at Laguna Seca with a time of 1:24.86, even though neither Koenigsegg test driver Markus Lundh nor the Jesko had ever been on that track before.

<doc id="17311" wikidata="Q1749" url="?curid=17311" title="Kaliningrad Oblast">
<text>Kaliningrad Oblast is the westernmost part of Russia. It is a small flat province separated from the rest of the country by the Baltic Sea and two European Union and NATO members: Poland to the south and Lithuania to the north and east. 

Half of the oblast&#x27;s one million people live in the city of Kaliningrad, formerly known as Königsberg, which is the provincial capital. Due to sanctions the economy is dependent on subsidies and the military. The port city of Baltiysk is Russia&#x27;s only port on the Baltic Sea that remains ice-free in winter.

Various peoples, including Lithuanians, Germans and Poles, lived on the land which is now Kaliningrad. In the 18th century it was East Prussia, which became part of Germany. But after defeat in World War II in the mid-20th century the Germans fled or were expelled, and the victorious Soviet Union repopulated the territory, mostly with Russians.

==History==
The territory of what is now the Kaliningrad Oblast used to be inhabited by the Old Prussians and other Western Balts, prior to the Teutonic conquest in the early Late Middle Ages. Afterwards, it was settled by Germans (especially the western part), Lithuanians (especially Lithuania Minor) and Poles (especially Königsberg, , and the current southern border strip). The Old Prussians became extinct due to Germanisation in the first half of the 18th century. The Lithuanian-inhabited areas of the Teutonic State were known as Lithuania Minor, which encompassed all of modern Kaliningrad Oblast until the 18th century.

=== Late Middle Ages ===

In the 13th century, the Teutonic Order conquered the region and established the State of the Teutonic Order, a theocracy. In 1255, on the foundations of a destroyed Sambian settlement known as , the Teutonic Order founded the city of Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad), naming it in honour of Ottokar II of Bohemia.

The Northern Crusades, including the Lithuanian Crusade, were partly motivated by colonization. The German colonist peasants, craftsmen, and merchants were predominantly concentrated in the southern part of the Teutonic State and did not move into Nadruvia and Skalvia due to the Lithuanian military threat.

In 1454, following a request by the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, the territory was incorporated to the Kingdom of Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon, an event that sparked the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466). After Poland&#x27;s victory in the war with the Second Peace of Thorn, the State of the Teutonic Order became a vassal of Poland, also considered an integral part of &quot;one and indivisible&quot; Kingdom of Poland. During this war, the capital of the Teutonic state was moved from Marienburg (now Malbork) to Königsberg in 1457. When the rulers of Prussia were vassals of the King of Poland from 1466 to 1660, there were few German colonists.

===Early modern period===
After the Teutonic Order lost the war of 1519–1521 with Poland, the Teutonic Order remained a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1525, Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg secularized the Teutonic Order&#x27;s Prussian branch and established himself as ruler of the Duchy of Prussia, the first Protestant state in Europe. Königsberg was the residence of the Duke of Prussia from 1525 until 1701, and was the Duchy of Prussia&#x27;s capital until 1660, when the capital moved to Berlin.

Polish and Lithuanian culture blossomed in Königsberg, with the city being the place of publication of the first Polish- and Lithuanian-language cathechisms (by Jan Seklucjan and Martynas Mažvydas), the first Polish translation of the New Testament, &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot;, the first Lithuanian grammar book, and the Albertina University being the second oldest university of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, after receiving a royal privilege from King Sigismund II Augustus in 1560. Polish printing continued for centuries with the last Polish publication in 1931.

In 1577, the Duke of Prussia forbade serfs—who were mostly Old Prussians, Lithuanians, and Masurians—to leave the land that was the property of the German knights who became proprietary nobles.

In 1618, the Duchy merged with the Margraviate of Brandenburg to form Brandenburg-Prussia, remaining under Polish suzerainty until 1660. There was strong opposition to the separation of the region from Poland, especially in Königsberg. A confederation was formed in the city to maintain Poland&#x27;s sovereignty over the city and region. The Brandenburg Elector and his army, however, entered the city and abducted and imprisoned the leader of the city&#x27;s anti-Elector opposition Hieronymus Roth. In 1663, the city burghers, forced by Elector Frederick William, swore an oath of allegiance to him, however, in the same ceremony they still also pledged allegiance to Poland.

In 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia prohibited Poles, Samogitians and Jews from settling in Lithuania Minor, and initiated German colonization to change the region&#x27;s ethnic composition. In 1734–1736, Königsberg was the place of stay of Polish King Stanisław Leszczyński during the War of the Polish Succession. In 1756 Russia decided to go to war with the Kingdom of Prussia and annex the territory, which was then to be offered to Poland as part of a territorial exchange desired by Russia. The territory was occupied and annexed by Russia in 1758 during the Seven Years&#x27; War before being returned to Prussia in 1762 when Russia switched sides in the war. It was then reorganized into the province of East Prussia within the Kingdom of Prussia in 1773.

The current oblast also contains the now abandoned village of Narmeln (), which was not part of Ducal Prussia, but of the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Kingdom of Poland until its annexation by the Kingdom of Prussia the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, and is thus part of the historic region of Pomerania.

=== 19th century ===

====Napoleonic invasion and occupation====
After the defeats of Jena–Auerstedt, the Kingdom of Prussia was invaded and Berlin was occupied by the French. The Court of Prussia fled to Königsberg, asking for Russian help. Russia intervened, leading to the bloody Battle of Eylau and Battle of Friedland in 1807. Following a French victory in the latter, both sides signed the Treaties of Tilsit.

====Historical ethnic and religious structure====
In 1817, East Prussia had 796,204 Protestants, 120,123 Catholics, 2,389 Jews, and 864 Mennonites.
In 1824, shortly before its merger with West Prussia, the population of East Prussia was 1,080,000 people. According to Karl Andree, Germans were slightly more than half of the people, while 280,000 (~26%) were ethnically Polish and 200,000 (~19%) were ethnically Lithuanian. As of 1819, there were also 20,000-strong ethnic Curonian and Latvian minorities as well as 2,400 Jews, according to Georg Hassel. Similar numbers are given by August von Haxthausen in his 1839 book, with a breakdown by county. However, the majority of East Prussian Polish and Lithuanian inhabitants were Lutherans, not Catholics like their ethnic kinsmen across the border in the Russian Empire. Only in southern Warmia did Catholic Poles—so called Warmians (not to be confused with predominantly Protestant Masurians)—comprise the majority of the population, numbering 26,067 people (~81%) in county Allenstein (Polish: Olsztyn) in 1837.

====German culture and Germanization====
In the 19th century, East Prussia was commonly viewed by German commentators as culturally backwards and a part of the &quot;German mission in the East&quot; rather than a core German territory. Pan-Germanist politician Ernst Hasse criticised the lack of folk identity and imagined community: &quot;It is the case that there is almost no common folk identity [Landsmannschaften] among the Poseners and Prussians at all. [...] Who can recognise a Posener or Prussian by dialect and character? Distinct features hardly exist.&quot; While the north of East Prussia was overwhelmingly German, the south was majority Slavic and mostly composed of Poles and Masurians. There was also a slight Lithuanian majority in the north-eastern area of East Prussia, Lithuania Minor. Regional and local identities were particularly strong in East Prussia - local Polish population often identified with Masuria rather than Poland, and Prussian Lithuanians also did not actively identify themselves with the Lithuanian nation. Moreover, confessional identity often prevailed over the national one - German authorities were concerned about the &quot;Catholic-Polish axis&quot;; German Catholics were alienated from the German nation because of the Kulturkampf legislation, and tended to support the Polish national movement. An East German newspaper &quot;Thorner Zeitung&quot; reported in 1871 that &quot;not only Polish Catholics, but also a great number of German Catholics, are willing to vote for a Polish party candidate&quot;.

By the end of the 19th century, East Prussia had a significant Polish minority, and German nationalist circles warned of the prospect of Polonization of East Prussia. The perceived weakness of Germanness of East Prussia was also reinforced by the Ostflucht, as East Prussia suffered from both underindustrialisation and rural overpopulation. After 1876, farm prices in East Prussia fell by 20 percent, which encouraged local landowners to hire foreign workers from Congress Poland, incidentally strengthening the Polish element in the region. The increased Slavic immigration to the region generated by the requirement of the Junkers for cheap labour and better economic conditions in West Germany caused many German inhabitants to leave the region. Most Germans moved to work in the industrial heartland of western Germany, while others migrated abroad. Poles and Lithuanians of East Prussia also had much higher birth-rate and natural increase rates than the Germans, and rarely emigrated. Discussing the situation in East Prussia, Polish geographer Stanisław Srokowski remarked:

The Memel Territory (Klaipėda region), formerly part of northeastern East Prussia as well as Prussian Lithuania, was annexed by Lithuania in 1923. In 1938, Nazi Germany radically renamed about a third of the place names of this area, replacing Old Prussian and Lithuanian names with newly invented German names.

====World War I and II====

In September 1914, after hostilities began between the German Empire on the one hand and France and Russia on the other, the Imperial German Army was about to seize Paris, and the French urged Russia to attack East Prussia. Nicholas II launched a major attack, resulting in a Russian victory in the Battle of Gumbinnen. The Russian army arrived at the outskirts of the city of Königsberg but did not take it and settled at Insterburg. This Russian victory and East Prussia&#x27;s occupation by Russia saved Paris by forcing the Germans to send many troops to their East provinces. Later, Hindenburg and Ludendorff pushed Russia back at the battle of Tannenberg, thereby liberating East Prussia from Russian troops. Yet Russian troops remained in the easternmost part of the region until early 1915.

During World War II, the was operated at modern Gromovo mostly interring Polish prisoners, as well as several subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp, the Oflag 52, Oflag 60 and Dulag Luft prisoner-of-war camps, and a camp interring Romani people in Königsberg (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;).

On 29 August 1944, Soviet troops reached the border of East Prussia. By January 1945, they had taken all of East Prussia except for the area around Königsberg. Many inhabitants fled west at this time. During the last days of the war, over two million people fled, anticipating imminent Red Army conquest, and were evacuated by sea.

==== Soviet annexation ====
Initially, at the end of World War II in 1945, the current southern border strip passed under Polish control with Polish administration organized in the towns of Gierdawy and Iławka, however, the area was eventually annexed by the Soviet Union and included within the Kaliningrad Oblast.

Under the Potsdam Agreement of 1 August 1945, Königsberg became part of the Soviet Union pending the final determination of territorial borders at an anticipated peace settlement. This final determination eventually took place on 12 September 1990 when the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was signed. The excerpt from the initial agreement pertaining to the partition of East Prussia, including the area surrounding Königsberg, is as follows (note that Königsberg is spelt &quot;Koenigsberg&quot; in the original document):

VI. CITY OF KOENIGSBERG AND THE ADJACENT AREAThe Conference examined a proposal by the Soviet Government that pending the final determination of territorial questions at the peace settlement, the section of the western frontier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which is adjacent to the Baltic Sea should pass from a point on the eastern shore of the Bay of Danzig to the east, north of Braunsberg – Goldep, to the meeting point of the frontiers of Lithuania, the Polish Republic and East Prussia.

The Conference has agreed in principle to the proposal of the Soviet Government concerning the ultimate transfer to the Soviet Union of the city of Koenigsberg and the area adjacent to it as described above, subject to expert examination of the actual frontier.

U.S. president Harry Truman and British prime minister Clement Attlee supported the proposal of the Conference at the forthcoming peace settlement.
In 1946, Königsberg was added as a semi-exclave to the Russian SFSR and renamed Kaliningrad, after the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Mikhail Kalinin. Kalinin was unrelated to the city, and there were already cities named in honour of Kalinin in the Soviet Union, namely &quot;Kalinin&quot; (now Tver) and &quot;Kaliningrad&quot; (now Korolev, Moscow Oblast). The German language was replaced with the Russian language, and the remaining German population was expelled between 1947 and 1948. The territory was then re-populated with Soviet citizens, mostly ethnic Russians but to a lesser extent also Ukrainians and Belarusians.

Some historians speculate that it may have originally been offered to the Lithuanian SSR because the resolution from the conference specifies that Kaliningrad&#x27;s border would be at the (pre-war) Lithuanian frontier. According to some historians, Joseph Stalin created it as an oblast separate from the Lithuanian SSR because it further separated the Baltic states from the West. Others think that the reason was that the region was far too strategic for the USSR to leave it in the hands of another SSR other than the Russian one. In the 1950s, Nikita Khrushchev offered the entire Kaliningrad Oblast to the Lithuanian SSR but Antanas Sniečkus refused to accept the territory because it would add at least a million ethnic Russians to Lithuania proper.

In the Soviet era, the city was completely closed and, with the exception of rare visits of friendship from neighboring Poland, it was practically not visited by foreigners. In 1950, there were 1,165,000 inhabitants, which was only half the number of the pre-war population. The old city was not restored, and the ruins of the Königsberg Castle were demolished in the late 1960s, on Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s personal orders, despite the protests of architects, historians and residents of the city. 

The reconstruction of the oblast, threatened by hunger in the immediate post-war years, was carried out through an ambitious policy of oceanic fishing with the creation of one of the main fishing harbours of the USSR in Kaliningrad city. Fishing not only fed the regional economy but also was a basis for social and scientific development, in particular oceanography. From 1953 to 1962, a monument to Stalin stood on Victory Square. In 1973, the town hall was turned into the House of Soviets. In 1975, the trolleybus was launched again. In 1980, a concert hall was opened in the building of the former Lutheran Church of the Holy Family. In 1986, the Kreuzkirche building was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church.

In 1957, an agreement was signed and later came into force which delimited the border between the Polish People&#x27;s Republic (a Soviet satellite state at the time) and the Soviet Union.

In 2010, the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published a report claiming that Kaliningrad had been offered to Germany in 1990 (against payment). The offer was not seriously considered by the West German government which, at the time, saw reunification with East Germany as a higher priority. However, this story was later denied by Mikhail Gorbachev.

===Recent history===

The independence of Lithuania in 1990 and full dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 isolated Kaliningrad from the rest of Russia, having previously been joined by other Soviet republics. This isolation became more severe when both Poland and Lithuania joined NATO and the European Union and imposed strict border controls on Kaliningrad Oblast. All military and civilian land links between the region and the rest of Russia now must pass through members of NATO and the EU. Thus far, the EU has rejected Russian proposals for visa-free travel between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia. Travel arrangements based on the &quot;Facilitated Transit Document (FTD)&quot; and &quot;Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD)&quot; have been made. Kaliningrad Oblast&#x27;s geographic isolation has badly affected its economic situation. Concurrent significant reduction in the size of the Russian military garrison has hurt as well, since previously the military was a major local employer.
Some of the region&#x27;s cultural heritage, most notably the Königsberg Cathedral, was restored in the 1990s, as citizens started to examine previously ignored German past.

On 12 January 1996, Kaliningrad Oblast and Sverdlovsk Oblast became the first oblasts of Russia to sign a power-sharing treaty with the federal government, granting them autonomy. However, this agreement was abolished on 31 May 2002.
After 1991, some ethnic Germans emigrated to the area, such as Volga Germans from other parts of Russia and Kazakhstan. These Germans are overwhelmingly Russian-speaking and as such were rejected for resettlement within Germany under Germany&#x27;s new rules. A similar migration by Poles from the lands of the former Soviet Union to the Kaliningrad Oblast occurred at this time as well. The situation has begun to change, albeit slowly. Germany, Lithuania, and Poland have renewed contact with Kaliningrad Oblast, through town twinning and other projects. This has helped to promote interest in the history and culture of the East Prussian and Lietuvininkai communities.

In July 2007, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov declared that if US-controlled missile defense systems were deployed in Poland, then nuclear weapons might be deployed in Kaliningrad. On 5 November 2008, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said that installing missiles in Kaliningrad was almost a certainty. These plans were suspended in January 2009, but implemented in October 2016. In 2011, a long-range Voronezh radar was commissioned to monitor missile launches within about . The radar is situated in the settlement of Pionersky in Kaliningrad Oblast.

A few months after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania started implementing EU sanctions, which blocked about 50% of the goods being imported into Kaliningrad by rail. Food, medicine, and passenger travel were exempted. Russia protested against the sanctions and announced it would increase shipments by sea. In May 2023, Poland officially adopted a new name for the Kaliningrad region, changing it from &quot;Obwód Kaliningradzki&quot; to &quot;Obwód Królewiecki&quot;, &quot;Królewiec&quot; being the historical Polish name for the city of Kaliningrad. The reason given for the change is that Mikhail Kalinin, a member of the Soviet Politburo, was among those responsible for the Katyn massacre, having co-signed the order to murder thousands of Polish prisoners of war.

==Geography==

Kaliningrad is the only Russian Baltic Sea port that is ice-free all year and hence plays an important role in the maintenance of the country&#x27;s Baltic Fleet.

The oblast is mainly flat, as the highest point is the Gora Dozor hill near the tripoint of the Poland–Russia border/Lithuania–Russia border.

As an exclave of Russia, it is surrounded by Poland (Pomeranian and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeships), Lithuania (Klaipėda, Marijampolė, and Tauragė Counties) and the Baltic Sea. Even if it is not surrounded by a single country, it can also be considered as a semi-exclave or semi-enclave because it is surrounded by the European Union and NATO. The end of the river Neman forms part of the Lithuania–Russia border.

Notable geographical features include the Curonian Lagoon (shared with Lithuania) and the Vistula Lagoon (shared with Poland). The oblast&#x27;s largest river is the Pregolya. The river starts as a confluence of the Instruch and the Angrapa and drains into the Baltic Sea through the Vistula Lagoon. Its length, strictly under the name &quot;Pregolya&quot;, is ; when including the Angrapa, is it long.

Major cities and towns include:
† Pre-1946 (the German-language names were also used in English in this period)

===Climate===
The climate of Kaliningrad Oblast gradually transitions from oceanic to humid continental depending on distance from the Baltic Sea moderation. It remains very mild by Russian standards with winters above freezing without the hot summers associated with the Russian interior on similar latitudes. The local climate is slightly wetter than similar latitudes farther west, but infrequent ice days lead to low snow accumulation regardless.

==Politics==
Anton Alikhanov was governor of Kaliningrad Oblast from 2017 until May 2024, when he was appointed as Minister of Industry and Trade. 

The region&#x27;s legislative body is the 40-seat Kaliningrad Oblast Duma.

==Administrative divisions==
==Demographics==
=== Population ===
As of the 2021 census, the population of the oblast was 1,027,678. Earlier censuses recorded a population of 955,281 in 2002 and 871,283 in 1989.

===Settlements===


===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2021 census, the ethnic composition of the oblast was as follows:

* 809,546 Russians (78.6%)
* 12,515 Ukrainians (1.2%)
* 11,360 Belarusians (1.1%)
* 8,379 Armenians (0.8%)
* 4,279 Lithuanians (0.4%)
* 4,118 Germans (0.4%)

Total fertility rate

Vital statistics for 2024:
*Births: 7,477 (7.3 per 1,000)
*Deaths: 13,016 (12.6 per 1,000)

Total fertility rate (2024):
1.20 children per woman

Life expectancy (2021): 
Total — 70.99 years (male — 66.51, female — 75.25)

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey, 34% of the population of Kaliningrad Oblast declared themselves to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 30.9% adhered to the Russian Orthodox Church, 22% were atheist, and 11.1% followed other religions or did not answer the question, 1% were unaffiliated generic Christians, and 1% were Roman Catholic.

Until 1945, the region was overwhelmingly Lutheran, with a small number of Roman Catholics and Jews. The state church of Prussia was dominant in the region. Although it had been both Reformed and Lutheran since 1817, there was an overwhelming Lutheran majority and very few Reformed adherents in East Prussia.
==Economy==

In 2022, the gross regional domestic product of Kaliningrad Oblast was ₽ 738 billion or US$ 10.6 billion and around US$10,000 per capita.

The existence of the oblast&#x27;s ice-free port and proximity to the European Union are economic advantages. It also has the world&#x27;s largest deposits of amber. The region has developed its tourism infrastructure and promotes attractions such as the Curonian Spit.

To address the oblast&#x27;s high rate of unemployment, in 1996 Russian authorities granted the oblast a special economic status that provided tax incentives intended to attract investors. The oblast&#x27;s economy benefited substantially and boomed. A US$45 million airport terminal was opened. The European Commission provided funds for business projects under its special program for the region. Both economic output and trade with the countries of the EU increased.

===Industry===
Car and truck assembly (GM, BMW, Kia, Yuejin by Avtotor) and the production of auto parts are major industries in Kaliningrad Oblast. There are shipbuilding facilities in Kaliningrad and Sovetsk. Food processing is a mature industry in the region, with Miratorg operating a sizeable food processing factory. OKB Fakel, a world leader in the field of Hall thruster development, as well as a leading Russian developer and manufacturer of electric propulsion systems, is based in Neman. The company employs 960 people. General Satellite (GS) is the biggest employer in Gusev city, manufacturing products such as satellite receivers, cardboard packaging, and nanomaterials.

===Natural resources===
More than 90% of the world&#x27;s known amber deposits are in Kaliningrad Oblast. Because of this, many Russians refer to the region as &quot;Amber Land&quot; (). Until recently, raw amber was exported for processing to other countries. In 2013, the Russian government banned the export of raw amber in order to boost the amber processing industry in Russia.

There are small oil reservoirs beneath the Baltic Sea not far from Kaliningrad&#x27;s shore. Small-scale offshore exploration started in 2004. Poland, Lithuania, and some local NGOs voiced concerns about possible environmental effects.

===Fishing===
Fishing is an important regional industry, with big fishing ports in Kaliningrad and Pionersky. There are smaller fishing ports in Svetly and Rybachy.

===Power generation===

With the desynchronization of the electricity systems of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from the Russian UPS synchronous area in February 2025, and their subsequent connection to the Continental Europe Synchronous Area via Poland, the Kaliningrad electrical grid became islanded from any other system.

Average yearly power consumption in the Kaliningrad Oblast was 3.5 TWh in 2004, of which local power generation provided just 0.235 TWh. The balance was imported from neighbouring countries. A new Kaliningrad power station was built in 2005, providing 50% of the oblast&#x27;s energy needs. This station was expanded in 2010, making the oblast independent from electricity imports.

In 2008, planning began for the construction of two nuclear power reactors, with costs estimated at €5 billion (US$8 billion). The project was suspended in May 2013. In 2014, the project was abandoned in response to environmental concerns and lack of support.

LNG from St. Petersburg supplied some of the energy in the Oblast.

==Agriculture==
The grain blight &quot;Fusarium graminearum&quot; in the oblast is genetically 3ADON, like the blight&#x27;s strain in Finland and Saint Petersburg. The researchers who discovered the genetic commonality speculate the cause may be a shared population that is distinct from other &quot;F.graminearum&quot; populations elsewhere.

<text>Kenneth MacAlpin (; ; 810 – 13 February 858) or [[Kenneth I]] was King of Dál Riada (841–850), and King of the Picts (848–858), of likely Gaelic origin. According to the traditional account, he inherited the throne of Dál Riada from his father Alpín mac Echdach, founder of the Alpínid dynasty. Kenneth I conquered the kingdom of the Picts in 843–850 and began a campaign to seize all of Scotland and assimilate the Picts, for which he was posthumously nicknamed &quot;An Ferbasach&quot; (&quot;The Conqueror&quot;). He fought the Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde and the invading Vikings from Scandinavia. Forteviot became the capital of his kingdom and Kenneth relocated relics, including the Stone of Scone from an abandoned abbey on Iona, to his new domain.

Kenneth I is traditionally considered the founder of Scotland, which was then known as Alba in Gaelic, although like his immediate successors, he bore the title of King of the Picts. It was Donald II that first bore the title of King of Alba as recorded by the Annals of Ulster and the Chronicon Scotorum. One chronicle calls Kenneth the first Scottish lawgiver but there is no information about the laws he passed.

== Origin ==

According to the genealogy of the Scottish kings, Kenneth&#x27;s father was Alpín mac Echdach, the King of Dál Riada, which existed in what is now western Scotland. Alpín is considered to be the grandson of Áed Find, a descendant of Cenél nGabráin, who ruled in Dál Riada. The &quot;Synchronism of the Irish Kings&quot; lists Alpín among the kings of Scotland. Modern historians are sceptical about the reign of Alpín in Dál Riada and his relationship with Áed, and believe this misconception is the result of negligence on the part of the scribes in some texts. The genealogy of the kings of Scotland and Dál Riada dates back to an original manuscript that was written during the reign of Malcolm III in the mid-to-late 11th century. The Rawlinson B 502 manuscript provides the following ancestry for Kenneth:

There is very limited information about Alpín, Kenneth&#x27;s father. Some of Dál Riada&#x27;s royal lists, which contain many scribal errors, say he ruled from 841 to 843. The &quot;Chronicle of Huntingdon&quot;, which was written in the late 13th century, states Alpín defeated the Picts at Galloway but the Picts then defeated him in a battle that took place in the same year, during which Alpín was killed. According to the chronicle, Alpín died on 20 July 834. This date is given in other sources but several researchers claim the date was probably copied from another source and the year of his death was obtained by recalculating the dates in the erroneous royal lists so they attribute Alpín&#x27;s date of death to 840 or 841.

Kenneth&#x27;s grandmother (Alpin&#x27;s mother), is said to have been a Pictish princess, the sister of Constantine I and Óengus II. According to the Pictish tradition, a female representative of the royal dynasty could inherit the crown. This origin gave Kenneth a legitimate claim to the Pictish throne.

Kenneth I had at least one brother, Donald I, who succeeded him as king.

== Life and reign ==
=== Early years ===
Kenneth MacAlpin is believed to have been born around 810 on the island of Iona, which is part of modern-day Scotland. After his father&#x27;s death, Kenneth succeeded him as the King of Dál Riada. His coronation took place in 840 or 841. One of the main sources on Kenneth&#x27;s life is the 10th century &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; which describes the reigns of Scottish kings from Kenneth I to Kenneth II ().

=== Conquest of Pictavia ===
According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, Kenneth came to a region that was inhabited by the Picts, during the second year of his reign in Dál Riada. Having defeated the Picts, Kenneth ruled there for 16 years. According to the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, compiled in the 15th century, he became the King of the Picts in 842 or 843 and died in 858. Although some sources state Kenneth ruled the Picts from 841 to 856, according to the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;, he became king in 843, a date that is generally accepted by most modern-day historians.

In the first half of the 9th century, the geopolitical situation in Dál Riada deteriorated. Almost the entire territory of the kingdom was mountainous and was filled with uneasy terrain. Kenneth&#x27;s realm lay between the powerful Kingdom of Strathclyde in the south and the Druim Alban mountain ridge in the east. It was difficult to pass through the provinces of Dál Riada, most of the land was infertile, and the kingdom had lost its western territories in the Hebrides to the Vikings, who had settled in the area and were raiding the borders of Dál Riada. These conditions may have forced Kenneth to attack the Picts.

After the death of Eóganan mac Óengusa in 839, Uurad, and then Bridei VI succeeded him as the King of the Picts. According to List One, Uurad&#x27;s reign lasted three years, while Bridei VI reigned for a year. According to List Two, Uurad reigned for two years, while Bridei VI&#x27;s reign lasted a month. The reigns of Uurad&#x27;s three sons were also present in List Two. Based on these accounts, the Pictish kingdom fell in 849 or 850. Many sources dating to the following periods state that the historical kingdom of the Picts and the Scots unified in 850. List Two states that the last Pictish King was killed in Forteviot or Scone. This is probably a reference to MacAlpin&#x27;s treason, a medieval legend first recorded in the 12th century by Giraldus Cambrensis. According to the legend, a Pictish nobleman is invited by the Scots to a meeting or a feast in Scone and is treacherously killed there. At the same time, List One gives the year 843 as the date when Kenneth received the title of King of the Picts.

Sources do not detail Kenneth&#x27;s conquest of Pictavia. No chronicle mentions either Kenneth&#x27;s continuing his father&#x27;s campaign against the Picts or his supposed claim to the Pictish crown. Modern-day historians suggest Kenneth was a descendant of Pictish kings through his mother or had ties with them through his wife. Kenneth&#x27;s grandmother (Alpin&#x27;s mother), was also said to have been a Pictish princess, the sister of Constantine I and Óengus II. It is likely the death of Eógananhe, &quot;Chronicle of Huntingdon&quot; gives the following interpretation of the events that took place after Eóganan&#x27;s death:

It is likely Kenneth killed the Pictish leaders and destroyed their armies during his conquest of Pictavia, after which he devastated the whole country. The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; record a single battle during Kenneth&#x27;s campaign, which according to Isabel Henderson, proves the Picts did not show any significant resistance to Kenneth&#x27;s forces, however, more evidence will have to be presented.

=== King of Alba ===
According to historical tradition, a new kingdom was formed after Kenneth annexed the kingdom of the Picts. This kingdom&#x27;s Gaelic name was Alba, which was later replaced with Scotia and Scotland. The rulers of the kingdom initially held the title of King of Alba, however in reality it wasn&#x27;t until at least 42 years after Kenneth&#x27;s death that the title King of Alba was ever used. Kenneth is retroactively listed in the royal lists dating to later periods as the first King of Scotland; modern historians, however, argue the final unification of the kingdom took place half a century later and that Kenneth&#x27;s main political achievement should be considered the creation of a new dynasty. This dynasty sought to dominate all of Scotland, under which the Scots assimilated the Picts, resulting in the quick disappearance of the Picts&#x27; language and institutions.

After the conquest of Pictavia, the Scots from Dál Riada began to migrate &quot;en masse&quot; to the territories populated by the Picts. The list of Pictish kings concludes in 850 and the list of kings of Dál Riada also ends around the same time, meaning the title ceased to exist. Kenneth I and his administration moved to Pictavia; it is possible the Scots moved to the region before the war and that such settlements played a major role in the selection of Scone as the capital of the Kingdom. Kenneth moved relics from an abandoned abbey on Iona, where Viking raids made life untenable, to Dunkeld, which was the centre of the Church of Scotland, in 848 or 849, according to the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;. The coronation stone was also moved from the island to Scone, for which it is referred to as the Stone of Scone. According to archaeological excavations, Forteviot was probably originally a royal residence but the place is not mentioned in the chronicles after the death of Donald I. The mass migration of Scots to the east most likely led to the assimilation of the Picts. Although the Irish annals, which date to the late 9th century, mention the title King of the Picts, the Picts may not have remained independent. The Pictish civil system and clerical laws were completely replaced with the Scottish legal system, and it is likely similar changes occurred in other spheres of the Pictish society. The Picts did not revolt against this assimilation process.

The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; describes the events that occurred during Kenneth&#x27;s reign without specifying their dates. He invaded Lothian in the Kingdom of Northumbria six times, and captured the towns of Melrose and Dunbar, and razed them. The Celtic Britons from the Kingdom of Strathclyde attacked Kenneth&#x27;s kingdom and burnt Dunblane. Furthermore, Viking invaders raided Pictavia, ravaging the territories &quot;from Clunie to Dunkeld&quot;.

Kenneth strengthened his power by arranging royal marriages with neighbouring states, marrying his daughters to the kings of Strathclyde and Ireland. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;, Kenneth was one of the first Scottish lawgivers but his laws have not survived to the 21st century.

== Death and succession ==
According to the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, Kenneth died in 858. The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; states he died in February in Forteviot due to a tumour. Historians suggest this date might be 13 February. Kenneth was buried in Iona Abbey. Succession in the kingdom was carried out in the form of tanistry so Kenneth&#x27;s successor was his brother Donald I rather than his eldest son. After the death of Donald I, Kenneth&#x27;s sons, Causantín mac Cináeda and Áed mac Cináeda, inherited the crown. The Alpínid dynasty, which ruled Scotland until the beginning of the 11th century, was formed during this period.

Contemporaneous Irish annals give Kenneth and his immediate successors the title King of the Picts, but do not call him the King of Fortriu, a title that was only given to four Pictish kings who reigned in the 7th to 9th centuries. It is possible the use of the title of King of the Picts was in reference to Kenneth and his immediate successors&#x27; claim to all of Pictavia, though there is very little evidence of the extent of their domain.

== Family ==
The name of Kenneth&#x27;s wife is unknown. There is a hypothesis she may have been a Pictish princess. Kenneth&#x27;s children were:
* Causantín mac Cináeda (), King of Alba;
* Áed of the White Flowers (), King of Alba;
* Unknown daughter. She married Rhun ab Arthgal (), the King of Strathclyde, and had a son, Eochaid (), who may have ruled as King of Strathclyde and/or King of the Picts;
* Máel Muire ingen Cináeda. She married Áed Findliath (), the High King of Ireland.

There is also a theory the wife of Amlaíb Conung (), the King of Dublin, was a daughter of Kenneth.

<doc id="17317" wikidata="Q57475" url="?curid=17317" title="Klaus Fuchs">
<text>Klaus Emil Julius Fuchs (29 December 1911 – 28 January 1988) was a German theoretical physicist and atomic spy who supplied information from the American, British, and Canadian Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union during and shortly after World War II. While at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fuchs was responsible for many significant theoretical calculations relating to the first nuclear weapons and, later, early models of the hydrogen bomb. After his conviction in 1950, he served nine years in prison in the United Kingdom, then migrated to East Germany where he resumed his career as a physicist and scientific leader.

The son of a Lutheran pastor, Fuchs attended the University of Leipzig, where his father was a professor of theology, and became involved in student politics, joining the student branch of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and the &quot;Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold&quot;, an SPD-allied paramilitary organisation. He was expelled from the SPD in 1932, and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He went into hiding after the 1933 Reichstag fire and the subsequent persecution of communists in Nazi Germany, and fled to the United Kingdom, where he received his PhD from the University of Bristol under the supervision of Nevill Francis Mott, and his DSc from the University of Edinburgh, where he worked as an assistant to Max Born.

After the Second World War broke out in Europe, he was interned in the Isle of Man, and later in Canada. After he returned to Britain in 1941, he became an assistant to Rudolf Peierls, working on &quot;Tube Alloys&quot;—the British atomic bomb project. He began passing information on the project to the Soviet Union through Ursula Kuczynski, codenamed &quot;Sonya&quot;, a German communist and a major in Soviet military intelligence who had worked with Richard Sorge&#x27;s spy ring in the Far East. In 1943, Fuchs and Peierls went to Columbia University, in New York City, to work on the Manhattan Project. In August 1944, Fuchs joined the Theoretical Physics Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory, working under Hans Bethe. His chief area of expertise was the problem of implosion, necessary for the development of the plutonium bomb. After the war, he returned to the UK and worked at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell as head of the Theoretical Physics Division.

In January 1950, Fuchs confessed that he had passed information to the Soviets over a seven-year period beginning in 1942. A British court sentenced him to fourteen years&#x27; imprisonment and he was subsequently stripped of his British citizenship. He was released in 1959, after serving nine years, and migrated to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), where he was elected to the Academy of Sciences and became a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) central committee. He was later appointed deputy director of the Central Institute for Nuclear Physics in Dresden, where he served until his retirement in 1979.

Post Cold War declassified information states that the Russians freely acknowledged that Fuchs gave them the fission bomb.

==Early life==
Klaus Emil Julius Fuchs was born in Rüsselsheim, Grand Duchy of Hesse, on 29 December 1911, the third of four children of a Lutheran pastor, Emil Fuchs, and his wife Else Wagner. His father served in the army during World War I but later became a pacifist and a socialist, joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1921. He eventually became a Quaker. Fuchs had an older brother Gerhard, an older sister Elisabeth, and a younger sister, Kristel. The family moved to Eisenach, where Fuchs attended the &quot;Martin-Luther Gymnasium&quot;, and took his &quot;Abitur&quot;. At school, Fuchs and his siblings were taunted over his father&#x27;s unpopular socialist political views, which they came to share. They became known as the &quot;red foxes&quot;, Fuchs being the German word for fox.

Fuchs was left-handed, but was forced to write with his right hand.

Fuchs entered the University of Leipzig in 1930, where his father was a professor of theology. He became involved in student politics, joining the student branch of the SPD, a party that his father had joined in 1921, and the &quot;Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold&quot;, the party&#x27;s paramilitary organisation. His father took up a new position as professor of religion at the Pedagogical Academy in Kiel, and in the autumn Fuchs transferred to the University of Kiel, which his brother Gerhard and sister Elisabeth also attended. Fuchs continued his studies in mathematics and physics at the university. In October 1931, his mother committed suicide by drinking hydrochloric acid. The family later discovered that his maternal grandmother had also taken her own life.

In the March 1932 German presidential election, the SPD supported Paul von Hindenburg for President, fearing that a split vote would hand the job to the Nazi Party (NSDAP) candidate, Adolf Hitler. However, when the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) ran its own candidate, Ernst Thälmann, Fuchs offered to speak for him, and was expelled from the SPD. That year Fuchs and all three of his siblings joined the KPD. Fuchs and his brother Gerhard were active speakers at public meetings, and occasionally attempted to disrupt NSDAP gatherings. At one such gathering, Fuchs was beaten up and thrown into a river.

When Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, Fuchs decided to leave Kiel, where the NSDAP was particularly strong and he was a well-known KPD member. He enrolled at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. On 28 February, while on a train to Berlin for a secret KPD meeting, he read a newspaper article on the Reichstag fire. Fuchs correctly assumed that opposition parties would be blamed for the fire, and surreptitiously removed his hammer and sickle lapel pin. Fellow party members urged him to continue his studies in another country. He went into hiding for five months in the apartment of a fellow party member. In August 1933, he attended an anti-fascist conference in Paris chaired by Henri Barbusse, where he met an English couple, Ronald and Jessie Gunn, who invited him to stay with them in Clapton, Somerset. He was expelled from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in October 1933.

==Refugee in Britain==
Fuchs arrived in England on 24 September 1933. Jessie Gunn was a member of the Wills family, the heirs to Imperial Tobacco and benefactors of the University of Bristol. She arranged for Fuchs to meet Nevill Francis Mott, Bristol&#x27;s professor of physics, and he agreed to take Fuchs on as a research assistant. Fuchs earned his PhD in physics there in 1937. A paper on &quot;A Quantum Mechanical Calculation of the Elastic Constants of Monovalent Metals&quot; was published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; in 1936. By this time, Mott had a number of German refugees working for him, and lacked positions for them all. He did not think that Fuchs would make much of a teacher, so he arranged a research post for Fuchs, at the University of Edinburgh working under Max Born, who was himself a German refugee. Fuchs published papers with Born on &quot;The Statistical Mechanics of Condensing Systems&quot; and &quot;On Fluctuations in Electromagnetic radiation&quot; in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot;. He also received a Doctorate in Science degree from Edinburgh. Fuchs proudly mailed copies back to his father, Emil, in Germany.

In Germany, Emil had been dismissed from his academic post, and, disillusioned with the Lutheran Church&#x27;s support of the NSDAP, had become a Quaker in 1933. He was arrested for speaking out against the government and was held for a month. His daughter, Elisabeth, married a fellow communist, Gustav Kittowski, with whom she had a child they named Klaus. Elisabeth and Kittowski were arrested in 1933, and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment but were freed at Christmas. Emil&#x27;s son, Gerhard, and his wife Karin were arrested in 1934 and spent the next two years in prison. Gerhard, Karin, Elisabeth and Kittowski established a car rental agency in Berlin, which they used to smuggle Jews and opponents of the government out of Germany.

After Emil was arrested in 1933, his other daughter, Kristel, fled to Zurich, where she studied education and psychology at the University of Zurich. She returned to Berlin in 1934, where she too worked at the car rental agency. In 1936, Emil arranged with Quaker friends in the United States for Kristel to attend Swarthmore College there. She visited her brother, Klaus Fuchs, in England &quot;en route&quot; to America, where she eventually married an American communist, Robert Heineman, and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She became a permanent resident in the United States in May 1938. In 1936, Kittowski and Elisabeth were arrested again, and the rental cars were impounded. Gerhard and Karin fled to Czechoslovakia. Elisabeth was released and went to live with her father, Emil, while Kittowski, sentenced to six years, later escaped from prison and also made his way to Czechoslovakia. In August 1939, Elisabeth died by suicide by throwing herself from a train, leaving Emil to raise her young son, Klaus.

==Second World War==
Fuchs applied to become a British subject in August 1939, but his application had not been processed before the Second World War broke out in Europe in September 1939. There was a classification system for enemy aliens, but Born provided Fuchs with a reference that said that he had been a member of the SPD from 1930 to 1932, and an anti-Nazi. There matters stood until June 1940, when the police arrived and took Fuchs into custody. He was first interned on the Isle of Man and then, in July, he was sent to internment camps in Canada, first on the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City and later at a site near Sherbrooke, Quebec. During his internment in 1940, he continued to work and published four more papers with Born: &quot;The Mass Centre in Relativity&quot;, &quot;Reciprocity, Part II: Scalar Wave Functions&quot;, &quot;Reciprocity, Part III: Reciprocal Wave Functions&quot; and &quot;Reciprocity, Part IV: Spinor Wave Functions&quot;, and one by himself, &quot;On the Statistical Method in Nuclear Theory&quot;.
While interned in Quebec, he joined a communist discussion group led by Hans Kahle. Kahle was a KPD member who had fought in the Spanish Civil War. After fleeing to Britain with his family, Kahle had helped Jürgen Kuczynski organise the KPD in Britain. Kristel arranged for mathematics professor Israel Halperin, the brother-in-law of a friend of hers, Wendell H. Furry, to send Fuchs some magazines, likely scientific journals. Max Born lobbied for his release. On Christmas Day 1940, Fuchs and Kahle were among the first group of internees to board a ship to return to Britain.

Fuchs returned to Edinburgh in January, and resumed working for Born. In May 1941, he was approached by Rudolf Peierls of the University of Birmingham to work on the &quot;Tube Alloys&quot; programme – the British atomic bomb research project. Despite wartime restrictions, he became a British subject on 31 July 1942 and signed an Official Secrets Act declaration form. As accommodation was scarce in wartime Birmingham, he stayed with Rudolf and Genia Peierls. Fuchs and Peierls did some important work together, which included a fundamental paper about isotope separation.

Soon after, Fuchs contacted Jürgen Kuczynski, who was now teaching at the London School of Economics. Kuczynski put him in contact with Simon Davidovitch Kremer (codename: &quot;Alexander&quot;; 1900-1991), the secretary to the military attaché at the Soviet Union&#x27;s embassy, who worked for the GRU (Russian: &quot;Главное Разведывательное Управление&quot;), the Red Army&#x27;s foreign military intelligence directorate. After three meetings, Fuchs was teamed up with a courier so he would not have to find excuses to travel to London. She was Ursula Kuczynski (codename: &quot;Sonya&quot;), the sister of Jürgen Kuczynski. She was a German communist, a major in Soviet Military Intelligence and an experienced agent who had worked with Richard Sorge&#x27;s spy ring in the Far East.

In late 1943, Fuchs (codename: &quot;Rest&quot;; he became &quot;Charles&quot; in May 1944) transferred along with Peierls to Columbia University, in New York City, to work on gaseous diffusion as a means of uranium enrichment for the Manhattan Project. Although Fuchs was &quot;an asset&quot; of GRU in Britain, his &quot;control&quot; was transferred to the NKGB (Russian: &quot;Народный Kомиссариат Государственной Безопасности&quot;), the Soviet Union&#x27;s civilian intelligence organisation, when he moved to New York. He spent Christmas 1943 with Kristel and her family in Cambridge. He was contacted by Harry Gold (codename: &quot;Raymond&quot;), an NKGB agent in early 1944.

From August 1944, Fuchs worked in the Theoretical Physics Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory, under Hans Bethe. His chief area of expertise was the problem of imploding the fissionable core of the plutonium bomb. At one point, Fuchs did calculation work that Edward Teller had refused to do because of lack of interest. He was the author of techniques (such as the still-used Fuchs-Nordheim method) for calculating the energy of a fissile assembly that goes highly prompt critical, and his report on blast waves is still considered a classic. Fuchs was one of the many Los Alamos scientists present at the Trinity test in July 1945.

Socially, Fuchs was later judged as someone who kept to himself, and never talked about politics. He was fairly well-liked. He dated grade school teachers Evelyn Kline and Jean Parker, and occasionally served as a babysitter for other scientists. He befriended Richard Feynman. Fuchs and Peierls were the only members of the British Mission to Los Alamos who owned cars, and Fuchs lent his Buick to Feynman so Feynman could visit his dying wife in a hospital in Albuquerque. When Fuchs was discovered to be a spy, his former colleagues were shocked. The postwar director of Los Alamos, Norris Bradbury, later said that:

:Fuchs was a strange man. I knew him, though not well. A very popular, very reticent bachelor, who was welcome at parties because of his nice manners. He worked very hard; worked very hard for us, for this country. His trouble was that he worked very hard for Russia, too. Basically, he hated the Germans bitterly. He had an undying hatred and he simply thought this country was not working hard enough to assist the Russians to defeat the Germans. Well, he was in his own odd way loyal to the United States. He suffered from a double loyalty.

Fuchs&#x27;s main courier in the United States was Harry Gold, a chemist who lived in Philadelphia, but was willing to travel to wherever Fuchs was. Allen Weinstein, the author of &quot;The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America&quot; (1999), has pointed out: &quot;The NKVD had chosen Gold, an experienced group handler, as Fuchs&#x27;s contact on the grounds that it was safer than having him meet directly with a Russian operative, but Semyon Semyonov was ultimately responsible for the Fuchs relationship.&quot;

Gold reported after his first meeting with Klaus Fuchs:
After the end of the war, in April 1946, he attended a conference at Los Alamos that discussed the possibility of a thermonuclear weapon; one month later, he filed a patent with John von Neumann, describing a thermonuclear weapon design the two had collaborated on. Though it was not a viable design, it was the first instance of the idea of radiation implosion being part of a weapon design. Radiation implosion would later become a core part of the successful Teller–Ulam design for thermonuclear weapons, but its importance was not appreciated at the time. Bethe considered Fuchs &quot;one of the most valuable men in my division&quot; and &quot;one of the best theoretical physicists we had.&quot;

==Post-war activities==
At the request of Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Robert Oppenheimer as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in October 1945, Fuchs stayed on at the laboratory into 1946 to help with preparations for the Operation Crossroads weapons tests. The US Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) prohibited the transfer of information on nuclear research to any foreign country, including Britain, without explicit official authority, and Fuchs supplied highly classified U.S. information to nuclear scientists in Britain and to his Soviet contacts.

, British official files on Fuchs were still being withheld. , the National Archives listed one dossier on Fuchs, KV 2/1263, including the &quot;Prosecution file. With summary of early interrogations ... and details of the scientifical/technical information passed to the Russians&quot;. The date of release of this material was not stated. According to an October 2020 book review, author Nancy Thorndike Greenspan &quot;appears to have had access to some of the Fuchs files that have been withheld at Kew, such as the AB/1 series, which has been closed for access for most human beings&quot;.

Fuchs was highly regarded as a scientist by the British, who wanted him to return to the United Kingdom to work on Britain&#x27;s postwar nuclear weapons programme. He returned in August 1946 and became the head of the Theoretical Physics Division at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. From late 1947 to May 1949 he gave Alexander Feklisov, his Soviet case officer, the principal theoretical outline for creating a hydrogen bomb and the initial drafts for its development as the work progressed in England and America. Meeting with Feklisov six times, he provided the results of the test at Eniwetok Atoll of uranium and plutonium bombs and the key data on production of uranium-235.

Also in 1947, Fuchs attended a conference of the Combined Policy Committee (CPC), which was created to facilitate exchange of atomic secrets at the highest levels of governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Donald Maclean, another Soviet spy, was also in attendance as British co-secretary of CPC.

==Detection and confession==

By September 1949, information from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating the source of their information. The Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. After a great deal of research for his 2019 biography, &quot;Trinity&quot;, Frank Close confirmed that while MI5 suspected Fuchs for over two years, &quot;it was decrypters at GCHQ who supplied clear proof of his guilt ... not the crack American team that is normally given all the credit&quot;, according to a review of the book.

Under interrogation by MI5 officer William Skardon at an informal meeting in December 1949, Fuchs initially denied being a spy and was not detained. According to Nancy Thorndike Greenspan, author of a 2020 book, &quot;Atomic Spy: The Dark Lives of Klaus Fuchs&quot;, Skardon told Fuchs that if he admitted his earlier espionage activity, he could be permitted to continue to work at Harwell. In October 1949, Fuchs had approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his father had been given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany, and this information became a factor as well. In early January Fuchs was informed that he must resign his position at Harwell because of his father&#x27;s appointment in East Germany. He was offered help in finding a university post.

Meeting with Skardon for a fourth time on 24 January 1950, Fuchs voluntarily confessed that he had shared information with the Soviets. According to Nancy Thorndike Greenspan, Skardon&#x27;s report on their meeting &quot;made no mention of his promise to Fuchs to stay on at Harwell if he confessed&quot;, but at the subsequent debriefing it was agreed &quot;to maintain FUCHS in his present state of mind, and for this state of mind to be in no way disturbed&quot;. To make it possible to prosecute Fuchs, Skardon proposed that Fuchs be asked to prepare a signed statement, which he then did at the War Office in London. The document included the statement &quot;I was given the chance of admitting it and staying at Harwell or clearing out.&quot;

Three days later, he also directed a statement more technical in content to Michael Perrin, the deputy controller of atomic energy within the Ministry of Supply. Fuchs told interrogators that the NKGB had acquired an agent in Berkeley, California, who had informed the Soviet Union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium-235 in 1942 or earlier. Fuchs&#x27;s statements to British and American intelligence agencies were used to implicate Harry Gold, a key witness in the trials of David Greenglass and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the United States. Fuchs later stated that he passed detailed information on the project to the Soviet Union through courier Harry Gold in 1945, and further information about Edward Teller&#x27;s unworkable &quot;Super&quot; design for a hydrogen bomb in 1946 and 1947. Fuchs also stated that &quot;The last time when I handed over information [to Russian authorities] was in February or March 1949&quot;.

Fuchs was arrested on 2 February 1950, charged with violations of the Official Secrets Act. Nancy Thorndike Greenspan quotes from police notes on a visit between fellow scientist Peierls and Fuchs in detention shortly after the news of the arrest broke. When Peierls asked Fuchs why he had spied, Fuchs answered: &quot;Knowledge of atomic research should not be the private property of any one country but should be shared with the rest of the world for the benefit of mankind.&quot;

==Value of data to Soviet project==
Hans Bethe once said that Fuchs was the only physicist he knew to have truly changed history. Considering that the pace of the Soviet programme was set primarily by the amount of uranium that it could procure, it is difficult for scholars to counterfactually judge how much time or effort was saved. Prior to the opening up of the Soviet archives in the early 1990s, scholars and analysts tended to assume that the Soviets would have applied any technical intelligence as directly as possible. However historical work after the end of the Cold War revealed that the head of the Soviet atomic project, Lavrenti Beria, did not entirely trust either his intelligence sources, nor his own scientists, and so instead used the intelligence information as a third-party check and guide, rather than exploiting it directly. Most of the scientists working on the Soviet bomb project were, accordingly, unaware that they were using any intelligence information as part of their research. Because of these conditions, it is hard to evaluate whether Fuchs&#x27;s information had an accelerating effect on the research, or if it even saved much effort, as the Soviets tended to re-do the research results independently anyway. And in many respects, the Soviet programme was not simply a recapitulation of the Manhattan Project: it explored several approaches that were not done during the war, such as the successful development of the gas centrifuge method of enrichment.

Fuchs&#x27;s own assessment of the effects of his actions, as reflected in an interview with his Perrin after his arrest, was he thought he could have saved the Soviets &quot;several years&quot; time (&quot;one year at least&quot;) because they could have started the development of the weapon design so that it was ready by the time sufficient fissile material became available:

Fuchs, however, was not told how the Soviets would or would not use his information, and though certain questions from his espionage contacts suggested to him that the Soviets had additional sources within the Manhattan Project, he was unaware of their identities and knowledge. He told Perrin that he was himself &quot;extremely surprised&quot; at the speed at which the Soviets developed their own atomic bomb, &quot;as he had been convinced that the information he had given could not have been applied so quickly and that the Russians would not have had the engineering design and construction facilities that would be needed to build large production plants in such a short time.&quot;

The information that Fuchs was able to give the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project was much more extensive, and much more technically precise, than that available from other, later-discovered atomic spies like David Greenglass or Theodore Hall. According to Fuchs&#x27;s interview with Perrin after capture, among his other disclosures, he gave the Soviets:

* As much information as he had available about the development of the implosion bomb, a topic he worked on substantially in a technical capacity. This included its theory, dimensions, components, and the justification for it being worked on (the fact that reactor-bred plutonium cannot be used in a gun-type design, something that had caught the United States by surprise in mid-1944). This included a &quot;a sketch of the bomb and its components, with important dimensions indicated&quot;, as well as detailed information about the &quot;urchin&quot; neutron source (initiator) of the plutonium bomb, on which he was credited as a key inventor.
* Information about the gaseous diffusion process for enriching uranium that he worked on.
* The critical masses for plutonium-239 and uranium-235, which had taken the United States considerable time to finalize and were important to all matters of weapons design and stockpile size. He also provided metallurgical information about the allotrope of plutonium used in the final weapon, and information about its stabilization through alloying with gallium.
* In June 1945, he informed them that the US was planning to test an atomic bomb that July, and where it would take place, and that it was intended to be used against Japan.
* The approximate rates of production of plutonium-239 and uranium-235 by the United States, as well as the amounts of material used in each bomb type, from which the Soviets could estimate the US nuclear stockpile size and growth—a key secret in the early Cold War.
* Information about ideas for future fission weapon designs, including the use of composite cores to more effectively use fissile material supplies.
* What information he knew about the state of the US hydrogen bomb interest and effort, which Fuchs characterized as being a &quot;confused picture&quot;. This included information that was contained in a series of lectures given by Enrico Fermi in the fall of 1945 on the fundamental physics of the &quot;Super&quot;, information about the then-secret inverse Compton effect, the basic idea of Teller&#x27;s &quot;Runaway Super&quot;, and detailed information about the bomb design he had developed with von Neumann. All of the information on the hydrogen bomb work was delivered after Fuchs had left the United States, in 1947, and only after being directly prompted for it by his contact.

Whether the information Fuchs passed relating to the hydrogen bomb would have been useful is still debated. Most scholars agree with Hans Bethe&#x27;s 1952 assessment, which concluded that by the time Fuchs left the thermonuclear programme in mid-1946, too little was known about the mechanism of the hydrogen bomb for his information to be useful to the Soviet Union. Fuchs&#x27;s knowledge and own work was in the context of the original, erroneous &quot;Runaway Super&quot; idea, which was not abandoned until early 1950 in the face of new calculations that showed it would not work. The United States only developed a new, successful approach—the Teller–Ulam design—in early 1951. Fuchs could not give away the secret of the hydrogen bomb, as neither he, nor anyone else, knew it prior to his arrest in 1950. 

The Soviet hydrogen bomb work also investigated the &quot;Runaway Super&quot; idea, and also found it to be a dead-end. Their own independent reinvention of the Teller–Ulam principle was accomplished through a different approach than in the United States. The Soviet physicist German Goncharov has noted that while Fuchs&#x27;s early work did not help Soviet efforts towards the hydrogen bomb, it was in retrospect closer to the right approach than any scientists (Soviet or American) recognised at the time. It contained in it the seed of the idea of radiation implosion, which turned out to be of great importance to the final design. In this way, Fuchs&#x27;s work was a &quot;precursor&quot; of the Teller–Ulam design, but only recognisable as such after the fact, as it was still missing some of the key elements of it and done in the context of a fundamentally different weapon.

The revelation of Fuchs&#x27;s espionage increased the rift between the United States and the United Kingdom on matters of atomic energy. Prior to it, the US and UK had been planning to collaborate more fully again on nuclear matters, something that had been put on hold after the passing of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. &quot;Whatever hopes had existed for a tightly-integrated programme with the British and Canadians died with the Fuchs revelation&quot;, as historians Richard G. Hewlett and Francis Duncan put it. The Anglo-American &quot;Special Relationship&quot; would ultimately be repaired by the mid-1950s.

==Trial and imprisonment==
Fuchs was prosecuted by Sir Hartley Shawcross and was convicted on 1 March 1950 of four counts of breaking the Official Secrets Act by &quot;communicating information to a potential enemy.&quot; Fuchs had entered guilty pleas, and his barrister Derek Curtis-Bennett limited his case to a general plea in mitigation on the grounds of his state of mind and desire to assist the Soviets in defeating the Nazis and winning the war. Fuchs consented to the advice not to raise the question of inducement in his decision to admit guilt.

After a trial lasting less than 90 minutes that was based on his confession, Lord Goddard sentenced Fuchs to 14 years&#x27; imprisonment, the maximum for espionage. The judge argued that his crime could not have been considered treason (which was a capital crime), because the Soviet Union was classed as an ally at the time. On 21 February 1951, he was formally stripped of his British citizenship.
The head of the British H-bomb project, Sir William Penney, visited Fuchs in prison in 1952. While imprisoned, Fuchs was friendly with the Irish Republican Army prisoner Seamus Murphy with whom he played chess and helped to escape.

Fuchs was released on 23 June 1959 after he had served nine years and four months of his sentence (as was then required in England where long-term prisoners were entitled by law to one third off for good behaviour in prison) at Wakefield Prison and promptly emigrated to the German Democratic Republic (GDR).

==Career in East Germany==
On arrival at Berlin Schönefeld Airport in the GDR, Fuchs was met by Margarete &quot;Grete&quot; Keilson, a friend from his years as a student communist. They were married on 9 September 1959.

In the GDR, Fuchs continued his scientific career and achieved considerable prominence as a leader of research. He became a member of the SED central committee in 1967, and in 1972 was elected to the Academy of Sciences where from 1974 to 1978 he was the head of the research area of physics, nuclear and materials science; he was then appointed deputy director of the Central Institute for Nuclear Physics in Rossendorf, Dresden, where he served until he retired in 1979. From 1984, Fuchs was head of the scientific councils for energetic basic research and for fundamentals of microelectronics. He received the Patriotic Order of Merit, the Order of Karl Marx and the National Prize of East Germany.
In &quot;The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation&quot; (2009) by Thomas Reed and Daniel Stillman, it is argued that a tutorial Fuchs gave to Qian Sanqiang and other Chinese physicists helped them to develop the first Chinese atomic bomb, the &quot;596&quot;, which was tested five years later. Three historians of nuclear weapons history, Robert S. Norris, Jeremy Bernstein, and Peter D. Zimmerman, challenged this particular assertion as &quot;unsubstantiated conjecture&quot; and asserted that &quot;The Nuclear Express&quot; is &quot;an ambitious but deeply flawed book&quot;.

==Death==
Fuchs died in Berlin on 28 January 1988. He was cremated and honoured with burial in the section of Berlin&#x27;s Friedrichsfelde Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
He was portrayed by Denis Forest in the 1987 television miniseries &quot;Race for the Bomb&quot;.

A documentary film about Fuchs, &quot;Väter der tausend Sonnen&quot; (&quot;Fathers of a Thousand Suns&quot;), was released in 1990.

&quot;Dark Sun&quot; (1995) by Richard Rhodes features a clerihew about Fuchs:
In 2022, Fuchs was the primary focus of the second season of the BBC World Service&#x27;s podcast &quot;The Bomb&quot;.

He is portrayed by American actor Christopher Denham in the 2023 film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.
In 2025 he appeared as a key character in the Rory Clements novel, &quot;A Cold Wind From Moscow&quot;.

<text>Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavski (; ; 7 August 1938) was a seminal Russian and Soviet theatre practitioner. He was widely recognized as an outstanding character actor, and the many productions that he directed garnered him a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation. His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his &quot;system&quot; of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique.

Stanislavski (his stage name) performed and directed as an amateur until the age of 33, when he co-founded the world-famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) company with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, following a legendary 18-hour discussion. Its influential tours of Europe (1906) and the US (1923–24), and its landmark productions of &quot;The Seagull&quot; (1898) and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1911–12), established his reputation and opened new possibilities for the art of the theatre. By means of the MAT, Stanislavski was instrumental in promoting the new Russian drama of his day—principally the work of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and Mikhail Bulgakov—to audiences in Moscow and around the world; he also staged acclaimed productions of a wide range of classical Russian and European plays.

He collaborated with the director and designer Edward Gordon Craig and was formative in the development of several other major practitioners, including Vsevolod Meyerhold (whom Stanislavski considered his &quot;sole heir in the theatre&quot;), Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov. At the MAT&#x27;s 30-year anniversary celebrations in 1928, a massive heart attack on-stage put an end to his acting career (though he waited until the curtain fell before seeking medical assistance). He continued to direct, teach, and write about acting until his death a few weeks before the publication of the first volume of his life&#x27;s great work, the acting manual &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot; (1938). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Lenin and was the first to be granted the title of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR.

Stanislavski wrote that &quot;there is nothing more tedious than an actor&#x27;s biography&quot; and that &quot;actors should be banned from talking about themselves&quot;. At the request of a US publisher, however, he reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, &quot;My Life in Art&quot; (first published in English in 1924 and in a revised, Russian-language edition in 1926), though its account of his artistic development is not always accurate. Three English-language biographies have been published: David Magarshack&#x27;s &quot;Stanislavsky: A Life&quot; (1950) ; Jean Benedetti&#x27;s &quot;Stanislavski: His Life and Art&quot; (1988, revised and expanded 1999). and Nikolai M Gorchakov&#x27;s &quot;Stanislavsky Directs&quot; (1954). An out-of-print English translation of Elena Poliakova&#x27;s 1977 Russian biography of Stanislavski was also published in 1982.

==Overview of the system==
Stanislavski subjected his acting and direction to a rigorous process of artistic self-analysis and reflection. His system of acting developed out of his persistent efforts to remove the blocks that he encountered in his performances, beginning with a major crisis in 1906. He produced his early work using an external, director-centred technique that strove for an organic unity of all its elements—in each production he planned the interpretation of every role, blocking, and the &quot;mise en scène&quot; in detail in advance. He also introduced into the production process a period of discussion and detailed analysis of the play by the cast. Despite the success that this approach brought, particularly with his Naturalistic stagings of the plays of Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky, Stanislavski remained dissatisfied.

Both his struggles with Chekhov&#x27;s drama (out of which his notion of subtext emerged) and his experiments with Symbolism encouraged a greater attention to &quot;inner action&quot; and a more intensive investigation of the actor&#x27;s process. He began to develop the more actor-centred techniques of &quot;psychological realism&quot; and his focus shifted from his productions to rehearsal process and pedagogy. He pioneered the use of theatre studios as a laboratory in which to innovate actor training and to experiment with new forms of theatre. Stanislavski organised his techniques into a coherent, systematic methodology, which built on three major strands of influence: (1) the director-centred, unified aesthetic and disciplined, ensemble approach of the Meiningen company; (2) the actor-centred realism of the Maly; and (3) the Naturalistic staging of Antoine and the independent theatre movement.

The system cultivates what Stanislavski calls the &quot;art of experiencing&quot; (to which he contrasts the &quot;art of representation&quot;). It mobilises the actor&#x27;s conscious thought and will to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes—such as emotional experience and subconscious behaviour—sympathetically and indirectly. In rehearsal, the actor searches for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the character seeks to achieve at any given moment (a &quot;task&quot;). Stanislavski&#x27;s earliest reference to his system appears in 1909, the same year that he first incorporated it into his rehearsal process. The MAT adopted it as its official rehearsal method in 1911.

Later, Stanislavski further elaborated the system with a more physically grounded rehearsal process that came to be known as the &quot;Method of Physical Action&quot;. Minimising at-the-table discussions, he now encouraged an &quot;active analysis&quot;, in which the sequence of dramatic situations are improvised. &quot;The best analysis of a play&quot;, Stanislavski argued, &quot;is to take action in the given circumstances.&quot;

Just as the First Studio, led by his assistant and close friend Leopold Sulerzhitsky, had provided the forum in which he developed his initial ideas for the system during the 1910s, he hoped to secure his final legacy by opening another studio in 1935, in which the Method of Physical Action would be taught. The Opera-Dramatic Studio embodied the most complete implementation of the training exercises described in his manuals. Meanwhile, the transmission of his earlier work via the students of the First Studio was revolutionising acting in the West. With the arrival of Socialist realism in the USSR, the MAT and Stanislavski&#x27;s system were enthroned as exemplary models.

==Family background and early influences==
Stanislavski had a privileged youth, growing up in one of the richest families in Russia, the Alekseyevs. He was born Konstantin Sergeyevich Alekseyev—he adopted the stage name &quot;Stanislavski&quot; in 1884 to keep his performance activities secret from his parents. Up until the communist revolution in 1917, Stanislavski often used his inherited wealth to fund his experiments in acting and directing. His family&#x27;s discouragement meant that he appeared only as an amateur until he was thirty three.

As a child, Stanislavski was interested in the circus, the ballet, and puppetry. Later, his family&#x27;s two private theatres provided a forum for his theatrical impulses. After his debut performance at one in 1877, he started what would become a lifelong series of notebooks filled with critical observations on his acting, aphorisms, and problems—it was from this habit of self-analysis and critique that Stanislavski&#x27;s system later emerged. Stanislavski chose not to attend university, preferring to work in the family business.

Increasingly interested in &quot;experiencing the role&quot;, Stanislavski experimented with maintaining a characterization in real life. In 1884, he began vocal training under Fyodor Komissarzhevsky, with whom he also explored the coordination of body and voice. A year later, Stanislavski briefly studied at the Moscow Theatre School but, disappointed with its approach, he left after little more than two weeks. Instead, he devoted particular attention to the performances of the Maly Theatre, the home of Russian psychological realism (as developed in the 19th century by Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Shchepkin).

Shchepkin&#x27;s legacy included a disciplined, ensemble approach, extensive rehearsals, and the use of careful observation, self-knowledge, imagination, and emotion as the cornerstones of the craft. Stanislavski called the Maly his &quot;university&quot;. One of Shchepkin&#x27;s students, Glikeriya Fedotova, taught Stanislavski; she instilled in him the rejection of inspiration as the basis of the actor&#x27;s art, stressed the importance of training and discipline, and encouraged the practice of responsive interaction with other actors that Stanislavski came to call &quot;communication&quot;. As well as the artists of the Maly, performances given by foreign stars influenced Stanislavski. The effortless, emotive, and clear playing of the Italian Ernesto Rossi, who performed major Shakespearean tragic protagonists in Moscow in 1877, particularly impressed him. So too did Tommaso Salvini&#x27;s 1882 performance of Othello.

==Amateur work as an actor and director==
By now well known as an amateur actor, at the age of twenty-five Stanslavski co-founded a Society of Art and Literature. Under its auspices, he performed in plays by Molière, Schiller, Pushkin, and Ostrovsky, as well as gaining his first experiences as a director. He became interested in the aesthetic theories of Vissarion Belinsky, from whom he took his conception of the role of the artist.

On , Stanislavski married Maria Lilina (the stage name of Maria Petrovna Perevostchikova). Their first child, Xenia, died of pneumonia in May 1890 less than two months after she was born. Their second daughter, Kira, was born on . In January 1893, Stanislavski&#x27;s father died. Their son Igor was born on .

In February 1891, Stanislavski directed Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Fruits of Enlightenment&quot; for the Society of Art and Literature, in what he later described as his first fully independent directorial work. But it was not until 1893 he first met the great realist novelist and playwright that became another important influence on him. Five years later the MAT would be his response to Tolstoy&#x27;s demand for simplicity, directness, and accessibility in art.

Stanislavski&#x27;s directorial methods at this time were closely modelled on the disciplined, autocratic approach of Ludwig Chronegk, the director of the Meiningen Ensemble. In &quot;My Life in Art&quot; (1924), Stanislavski described this approach as one in which the director is &quot;forced to work without the help of the actor&quot;. From 1894 onward, Stanislavski began to assemble detailed prompt-books that included a directorial commentary on the entire play and from which not even the smallest detail was allowed to deviate.

Whereas the Ensemble&#x27;s effects tended toward the grandiose, Stanislavski introduced lyrical elaborations through the &quot;mise-en-scène&quot; that dramatised more mundane and ordinary elements of life, in keeping with Belinsky&#x27;s ideas about the &quot;poetry of the real&quot;. By means of his rigid and detailed control of all theatrical elements, including the strict choreography of the actors&#x27; every gesture, in Stanislavski&#x27;s words &quot;the inner kernel of the play was revealed by itself&quot;. Analysing the Society&#x27;s production of &quot;Othello&quot; (1896), Jean Benedetti observes that:

Stanislavski uses the theatre and its technical possibilities as an instrument of expression, a language, in its own right. The dramatic meaning is in the staging itself. [...] He went through the whole play in a completely different way, not relying on the text as such, with quotes from important speeches, not providing a &#x27;literary&#x27; explanation, but speaking in terms of the play&#x27;s dynamic, its action, the thoughts and feelings of the protagonists, the world in which they lived. His account flowed uninterruptedly from moment to moment.

Benedetti argues that Stanislavski&#x27;s task at this stage was to unite the realistic tradition of the creative actor inherited from Shchepkin and Gogol with the director-centred, organically unified Naturalistic aesthetic of the Meiningen approach. That synthesis would emerge eventually, but only in the wake of Stanislavski&#x27;s directorial struggles with Symbolist theatre and an artistic crisis in his work as an actor. &quot;The task of our generation&quot;, Stanislavski wrote as he was about to found the Moscow Art Theatre and begin his professional life in the theatre, is &quot;to liberate art from outmoded tradition, from tired cliché and to give greater freedom to imagination and creative ability.&quot;

==Creation of the Moscow Art Theatre==

Stanislavski&#x27;s historic meeting with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko on led to the creation of what was called initially the &quot;Moscow Public-Accessible Theatre&quot;, but which came to be known as the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT). Their eighteen-hour-long discussion has acquired a legendary status in the history of theatre.

Nemirovich was a successful playwright, critic, theatre director, and acting teacher at the Philharmonic School who, like Stanislavski, was committed to the idea of a popular theatre. Their abilities complemented one another: Stanislavski brought his directorial talent for creating vivid stage images and selecting significant details; Nemirovich, his talent for dramatic and literary analysis, his professional expertise, and his ability to manage a theatre. Stanislavski later compared their discussions to the Treaty of Versailles, their scope was so wide-ranging; they agreed on the conventional practices they wished to abandon and, on the basis of the working method they found they had in common, defined the policy of their new theatre.

Stanislavski and Nemirovich planned a professional company with an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity; they would create a realistic theatre of international renown, with popular prices for seats, whose organically unified aesthetic would bring together the techniques of the Meiningen Ensemble and those of André Antoine&#x27;s Théâtre Libre (which Stanislavski had seen during trips to Paris). Nemirovich assumed that Stanislavski would fund the theatre as a privately owned business, but Stanislavski insisted on a limited, joint stock company. Viktor Simov, whom Stanislavski had met in 1896, was engaged as the company&#x27;s principal designer.

In his opening speech on the first day of rehearsals, , Stanislavski stressed the &quot;social character&quot; of their collective undertaking. In an atmosphere more like a university than a theatre, as Stanislavski described it, the company was introduced to his working method of extensive reading and research and detailed rehearsals in which the action was defined at the table before being explored physically. Stanislavski&#x27;s lifelong relationship with Vsevolod Meyerhold began during these rehearsals; by the end of June, Meyerhold was so impressed with Stanislavski&#x27;s directorial skills that he declared him a genius.

==Naturalism at the MAT==
The lasting significance of Stanislavski&#x27;s early work at the MAT lies in its development of a Naturalistic performance mode. In 1898, Stanislavski co-directed with Nemirovich the first of his productions of the work of Anton Chekhov. The MAT production of &quot;The Seagull&quot; was a crucial milestone for the fledgling company that has been described as &quot;one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama.&quot; Despite its 80 hours of rehearsal—a considerable length by the standards of the conventional practice of the day—Stanislavski felt it was under-rehearsed. The production&#x27;s success was due to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time.

Stanislavski went on to direct the successful premières of Chekhov&#x27;s other major plays: &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in 1899 (in which he played Astrov), &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in 1901 (playing Vershinin), and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; in 1904 (playing Gaev). Stanislavski&#x27;s encounter with Chekhov&#x27;s drama proved crucial to the creative development of both men. His ensemble approach and attention to the psychological realities of its characters revived Chekhov&#x27;s interest in writing for the stage, while Chekhov&#x27;s unwillingness to explain or expand on the text forced Stanislavski to dig beneath its surface in ways that were new in theatre.

In response to Stanislavski&#x27;s encouragement, Maxim Gorky promised to launch his playwrighting career with the MAT. In 1902, Stanislavski directed the première productions of the first two of Gorky&#x27;s plays, &quot;The Philistines&quot; and &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;. As part of the rehearsal preparations for the latter, Stanislavski took the company to visit Khitrov Market, where they talked to its down-and-outs and soaked up its atmosphere of destitution. Stanislavski based his characterisation of Satin on an ex-officer he met there, who had fallen into poverty through gambling. &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; was a triumph that matched the production of &quot;The Seagull&quot; four years earlier, though Stanislavski regarded his own performance as external and mechanical.

The productions of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; remained in the MAT&#x27;s repertoire for decades. Along with Chekhov and Gorky, the drama of Henrik Ibsen formed an important part of Stanislavski&#x27;s work at this time—in its first two decades, the MAT staged more plays by Ibsen than any other playwright. In its first decade, Stanislavski directed &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (in which he played Løvborg), &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; (playing Dr Stockmann, his favorite role), &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, and &quot;Ghosts&quot;. &quot;More&#x27;s the pity I was not a Scandinavian and never saw how Ibsen was played in Scandinavia,&quot; Stanislavski wrote, because &quot;those who have been there tell me that he is interpreted as simply, as true to life, as we play Chekhov&quot;. He also staged other important Naturalistic works, including Gerhart Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;Drayman Henschel&quot;, &quot;Lonely People&quot;, and &quot;Michael Kramer&quot; and Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Darkness&quot;.

==Symbolism and the Theatre-Studio==
In 1904, Stanislavski finally acted on a suggestion made by Chekhov two years earlier that he stage several one-act plays by Maurice Maeterlinck, the Belgian Symbolist. Despite his enthusiasm, however, Stanislavski struggled to realise a theatrical approach to the static, lyrical dramas. When the triple bill consisting of &quot;The Blind&quot;, &quot;Intruder&quot;, and &quot;Interior&quot; opened on , the experiment was deemed a failure.

Meyerhold, prompted by Stanislavski&#x27;s positive response to his new ideas about Symbolist theatre, proposed that they form a &quot;theatre studio&quot; (a term which he invented) that would function as &quot;a laboratory for the experiments of more or less experienced actors.&quot; The Theatre-Studio aimed to develop Meyerhold&#x27;s aesthetic ideas into new theatrical forms that would return the MAT to the forefront of the avant-garde and Stanislavski&#x27;s socially conscious ideas for a network of &quot;people&#x27;s theatres&quot; that would reform Russian theatrical culture as a whole. Central to Meyerhold&#x27;s approach was the use of improvisation to develop the performances.

When the studio presented a work-in-progress, Stanislavski was encouraged; when performed in a fully equipped theatre in Moscow, however, it was regarded as a failure and the studio folded. Meyerhold drew an important lesson: &quot;one must first educate a new actor and only then put new tasks before him&quot;, he wrote, adding that &quot;Stanislavski, too, came to such a conclusion.&quot; Reflecting in 1908 on the Theatre-Studio&#x27;s demise, Stanislavski wrote that &quot;our theatre found its future among its ruins.&quot; Nemirovich disapproved of what he described as the malign influence of Meyerhold on Stanislavski&#x27;s work at this time.

Stanislavski engaged two important new collaborators in 1905: Liubov Gurevich became his literary advisor and Leopold Sulerzhitsky became his personal assistant. Stanislavski revised his interpretation of the role of Trigorin (and Meyerhold reprised his role as Konstantin) when the MAT revived its production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; on .

This was the year of the abortive revolution in Russia. Stanislavski signed a protest against the violence of the secret police, Cossack troops, and the right-wing extremist paramilitary &quot;Black Hundreds&quot;, which was submitted to the Duma on the . Rehearsals for the MAT&#x27;s production of Alexander Griboyedov&#x27;s classic verse comedy &quot;Woe from Wit&quot; were interrupted by gun-battles on the streets outside. Stanislavski and Nemirovich closed the theatre and embarked on the company&#x27;s first tour outside of Russia.

==European tour and artistic crisis==
The MAT&#x27;s first European tour began on in Berlin, where they played to an audience that included Max Reinhardt, Gerhart Hauptmann, Arthur Schnitzler, and Eleonora Duse. &quot;It&#x27;s as though we were the revelation&quot;, Stanislavski wrote of the rapturous acclaim they received. The success of the tour provided financial security for the company, garnered an international reputation for their work, and made a significant impact on European theatre. The tour also provoked a major artistic crisis for Stanislavski that had a significant impact on &quot;his&quot; future direction. From his attempts to resolve this crisis, his system would eventually emerge.

Sometime in March 1906—Jean Benedetti suggests that it was during &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;—Stanislavski became aware that he was acting without a flow of inner impulses and feelings and that as a consequence his performance had become mechanical. He spent June and July in Finland on holiday, where he studied, wrote, and reflected. With his notebooks on his own experience from 1889 onwards, he attempted to analyze &quot;the foundation stones of our art&quot; and the actor&#x27;s creative process in particular. He began to formulate a psychological approach to controlling the actor&#x27;s process in a &quot;Manual on Dramatic Art&quot;.

==Productions as research into working methods==

Stanislavski&#x27;s activities began to move in a very different direction: his productions became opportunities for research, he was more interested in the process of rehearsal than its product, and his attention shifted away from the MAT towards its satellite projects—the theatre studios—in which he would develop his system. On his return to Moscow, he explored his new psychological approach in his production of Knut Hamsun&#x27;s Symbolist play &quot;The Drama of Life&quot;. Nemirovich was particularly hostile to his new methods and their relationship continued to deteriorate in this period. In a statement made on , Stanislavski marked a significant shift in his directorial method and stressed the crucial contribution he now expected from a creative actor:

The committee is wrong if it thinks that the director&#x27;s preparatory work in the study is necessary, as previously, when he alone decided the whole plan and all the details of the production, wrote the &quot;mise en scène&quot; and answered all the actors&#x27; questions for them. The director is no longer king, as before, when the actor possessed no clear individuality. [...] It is essential to understand this—rehearsals are divided into two stages: the first stage is one of experiment when the cast helps the director, the second is creating the performance when the director helps the cast.

Stanislavski&#x27;s preparations for Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (which was to become his most famous production to-date) included improvisations and other exercises to stimulate the actors&#x27; imaginations; Nemirovich described one in which the cast imitated various animals. In rehearsals he sought ways to encourage his actors&#x27; will to create afresh in every performance. He focused on the search for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the characters are seeking to achieve at any given moment (what he would come to call their &quot;task&quot;). This use of the actor&#x27;s conscious thought and will was designed to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes—such as emotional experience and subconscious behaviour—sympathetically and indirectly.

Noting the importance to great actors&#x27; performances of their ability to remain relaxed, he discovered that he could abolish physical tension by focusing his attention on the specific action that the play demanded; when his concentration wavered, his tension returned. &quot;What fascinates me most&quot;, Stanislavski wrote in May 1908, &quot;is the rhythm of feelings, the development of affective memory and the psycho-physiology of the creative process.&quot; His interest in the creative use of the actor&#x27;s personal experiences was spurred by a chance conversation in Germany in July that led him to the work of French psychologist Théodule-Armand Ribot. His &quot;affective memory&quot; contributed to the technique that Stanislavski would come to call &quot;emotion memory&quot;.

Together these elements formed a new vocabulary with which he explored a &quot;return to realism&quot; in a production of Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; as soon as &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; had opened. At a theatre conference on , Stanislavski delivered a paper on his emerging system that stressed the role of his techniques of the &quot;magic if&quot; (which encourages the actor to respond to the fictional circumstances of the play &quot;as if&quot; they were real) and emotion memory. He developed his ideas about three trends in the history of acting, which were to appear eventually in the opening chapters of &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot;: &quot;stock-in-trade&quot; acting, the art of representation, and the art of experiencing (his own approach).

Stanislavski&#x27;s production of &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (1909) was a watershed in his artistic development. Breaking the MAT&#x27;s tradition of open rehearsals, he prepared Turgenev&#x27;s play in private. They began with a discussion of what he would come to call the &quot;through-line&quot; for the characters (their emotional development and the way they change over the course of the play). This production is the earliest recorded instance of his practice of analysing the action of the script into discrete &quot;bits&quot;.

At this stage in the development of his approach, Stanislavski&#x27;s technique was to identify the emotional state contained in the psychological experience of the character during each bit and, through the use of the actor&#x27;s emotion memory, to forge a subjective connection to it. Only after two months of rehearsals were the actors permitted to physicalise the text. Stanislavski insisted that they should play the actions that their discussions around the table had identified. Having realised a particular emotional state in a physical action, he assumed at this point in his experiments, the actor&#x27;s repetition of that action would evoke the desired emotion. As with his experiments in &quot;The Drama of Life&quot;, they also explored non-verbal communication, whereby scenes were rehearsed as &quot;silent &quot;études&quot;&quot; with actors interacting &quot;only with their eyes&quot;. The production&#x27;s success when it opened in December 1909 seemed to prove the validity of his new methodology.

Late in 1910, Gorky invited Stanislavski to join him in Capri, where they discussed actor training and Stanislavski&#x27;s emerging &quot;grammar&quot;. Inspired by a popular theatre performance in Naples that employed the techniques of the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, Gorky suggested that they form a company, modeled on the medieval strolling players, in which a playwright and group of young actors would devise new plays together by means of improvisation. Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio.

== Staging the classics ==
In his treatment of the classics, Stanislavski believed that it was legitimate for actors and directors to ignore the playwright&#x27;s intentions for a play&#x27;s staging. One of his most important—a collaboration with Edward Gordon Craig on a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;—became a landmark of 20th-century theatrical modernism. Stanislavski hoped to prove that his recently developed system for creating internally justified, realistic acting could meet the formal demands of a classic play. Craig envisioned a Symbolist monodrama in which every aspect of production would be subjugated to the protagonist: it would present a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet&#x27;s eyes.

Despite these contrasting approaches, the two practitioners did share some artistic assumptions; the system had developed out of Stanislavski&#x27;s experiments with Symbolist drama, which had shifted his attention from a Naturalistic external surface to the characters&#x27; subtextual, inner world. Both had stressed the importance of achieving a unity of all theatrical elements in their work. Their production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre, placing it &quot;on the cultural map for Western Europe&quot;, and it has come to be regarded as a seminal event that revolutionised the staging of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. It became &quot;one of the most famous and passionately discussed productions in the history of the modern stage.&quot;

Increasingly absorbed by his teaching, in 1913 Stanislavski held open rehearsals for his production of Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot; as a demonstration of the system. As with his production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and his next, Goldoni&#x27;s &quot;The Mistress of the Inn&quot;, he was keen to assay his system in the crucible of a classical text. He began to inflect his technique of dividing the action of the play into bits with an emphasis on improvisation; he would progress from analysis, through free improvisation, to the language of the text:
I divide the work into &quot;large bits&quot; clarifying the nature of each bit. Then, immediately, in my own words, I play each bit, observing all the curves. Then I go through the experiences of each bit ten times or so with its curves (not in a fixed way, not being consistent). Then I follow the successive bits in the book. And finally, I make the transition, imperceptibly, to the experiences as expressed in the actual words of the part.
Stanislavski&#x27;s struggles with both the Molière and Goldoni comedies revealed the importance of an appropriate definition of what he calls a character&#x27;s &quot;super-task&quot; (the core problem that unites and subordinates the character&#x27;s moment-to-moment tasks). This impacted particularly on the actors&#x27; ability to serve the plays&#x27; genre, because an unsatisfactory definition produced tragic rather than comic performances.

Other European classics directed by Stanislavski include: Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and &quot;Othello&quot;, an unfinished production of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, and Beaumarchais&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. Other classics of the Russian theatre directed by Stanislavki include: several plays by Ivan Turgenev, Griboyedov&#x27;s &quot;Woe from Wit&quot;, Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, and plays by Tolstoy, Ostrovsky, and Pushkin.

==Studios and the search for a system==
Following the success of his production of &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;, Stanislavski made repeated requests to the board of the MAT for proper facilities to pursue his pedagogical work with young actors. Gorky encouraged him not to found a drama school to teach inexperienced beginners, but rather—following the example of the Theatre-Studio of 1905—to create a studio for research and experiment that would train young professionals.

Stanislavski created the First Studio on . Its founding members included Yevgeny Vakhtangov, Michael Chekhov, Richard Boleslawski, and Maria Ouspenskaya, all of whom would exert a considerable influence on the subsequent history of theatre. Stanislavski selected Suler (as Gorky had nicknamed Sulerzhitsky) to lead the studio. In a focused, intense atmosphere, their work emphasised experimentation, improvisation, and self-discovery. Following Gorky&#x27;s suggestions about devising new plays through improvisation, they searched for &quot;the creative process common to authors, actors and directors&quot;.

Stanislavski created the Second Studio of the MAT in 1916, in response to a production of Zinaida Gippius&#x27; &quot;The Green Ring&quot; that a group of young actors had prepared independently. With a greater focus on pedagogical work than the First Studio, the Second Studio provided the environment in which Stanislavski developed the training techniques that would form the basis for his manual &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot; (1938).

A significant influence on the development of the system came from Stanislavski&#x27;s experience teaching and directing at his Opera Studio, which was founded in 1918. He hoped that the successful application of his system to opera, with its inescapable conventionality and artifice, would demonstrate the universality of his approach to performance and unite the work of Mikhail Shchepkin and Feodor Chaliapin. From this experience Stanislavski&#x27;s notion of &quot;tempo-rhythm&quot; emerged. He invited Serge Wolkonsky to teach diction and Lev Pospekhin to teach expressive movement and dance and attended both of their classes as a student.

== From the First World War to the October Revolution ==
Stanislavski spent the summer of 1914 in Marienbad where, as he had in 1906, he researched the history of theatre and theories of acting to clarify the discoveries that his practical experiments had produced. When the First World War broke out, Stanislavski was in Munich. &quot;It seemed to me&quot;, he wrote of the atmosphere at the train station in an article detailing his experiences, &quot;that death was hovering everywhere.&quot;

The train was stopped at Immenstadt, where German soldiers denounced him as a Russian spy. Held in a room at the station with a large crowd with &quot;the faces of wild beasts&quot; baying at its windows, Stanislavski believed he was to be executed. He remembered that he was carrying an official document that mentioned having played to Kaiser Wilhelm during their tour of 1906 that, when he showed it to the officers, produced a change of attitude towards his group. They were placed on a slow train to Kempten. Gurevich later related how during the journey Stanislavski surprised her when he whispered that:

[E]vents of recent days had given him a clear impression of the superficiality of all that was called human culture, bourgeois culture, that a completely different kind of life was needed, where all needs were reduced to the minimum, where there was work—real artistic work—on behalf of the people, for those who had not yet been consumed by this bourgeois culture.

In Kempten they were again ordered into one of the station&#x27;s rooms, where Stanislavski overheard the German soldiers complain of a lack of ammunition; it was only this, he understood, that prevented their execution. The following morning they were placed on a train and eventually returned to Russia via Switzerland and France.

Turning to the classics of Russian theatre, the MAT revived Griboyedov&#x27;s comedy &quot;Woe from Wit&quot; and planned to stage three of Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;little tragedies&quot; in early 1915. Stanislavski continued to develop his system, explaining at an open rehearsal for &quot;Woe from Wit&quot; his concept of the state of &quot;I am being&quot;. This term marks the stage in the rehearsal process when the distinction between actor and character blurs (producing the &quot;actor/role&quot;), subconscious behavior takes the lead, and the actor feels fully present in the dramatic moment. He stressed the importance to achieving this state of a focus on action (&quot;What would I do if ...&quot;) rather than emotion (&quot;How would I feel if ...&quot;): &quot;You must ask the kinds of questions that lead to dynamic action.&quot; Instead of forcing emotion, he explained, actors should notice what is happening, attend to their relationships with the other actors, and try to understand &quot;through the senses&quot; the fictional world that surrounds them.

When he prepared for his role in Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;, Stanislavski created a biography for Salieri in which he imagined the character&#x27;s memories of each incident mentioned in the play, his relationships with the other people involved, and the circumstances that had impacted on Salieri&#x27;s life. When he attempted to render all of this detail in performance, however, the subtext overwhelmed the text; overladen with heavy pauses, Pushkin&#x27;s verse was fragmented to the point of incomprehensibility. His struggles with this role prompted him to attend more closely to the structure and dynamics of language in drama; to that end, he studied Serge Wolkonsky&#x27;s &quot;The Expressive Word&quot; (1913).

The French theatre practitioner Jacques Copeau contacted Stanislavski in October 1916. As a result of his conversations with Edward Gordon Craig, Copeau had come to believe that his work at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier shared a common approach with Stanislavski&#x27;s investigations at the MAT. On , Stanislavski&#x27;s assistant and closest friend, Leopold Sulerzhitsky, died from chronic nephritis. Reflecting on their relationship in 1931, Stanislavski said that Suler had understood him completely and that no one, since, had replaced him.

== Revolutions of 1917 and the Civil War years ==
Stanislavski welcomed the February Revolution of 1917 and its overthrow of the absolute monarchy as a &quot;miraculous liberation of Russia&quot;. With the October Revolution later in the year, the MAT closed for a few weeks and the First Studio was occupied by revolutionaries. Stanislavski thought that the social upheavals presented an opportunity to realize his long-standing ambitions to establish a Russian popular theatre that would provide, as the title of an essay he prepared that year put it, &quot;The Aesthetic Education of the Popular Masses&quot;.

Vladimir Lenin, who became a frequent visitor to the MAT after the revolution, praised Stanislavski as &quot;a real artist&quot; and indicated that, in his opinion, Stanislavski&#x27;s approach was &quot;the direction the theatre should take.&quot; The revolutions of that year brought about an abrupt change in Stanislavski&#x27;s finances when his factories were nationalized, which left his wage from the MAT as his only source of income. On 29 August 1918 Stanislavski, along with several others from the MAT, was arrested by the Cheka, though he was released the following day.

During the years of the Civil War, Stanislavski concentrated on teaching his system, directing (both at the MAT and its studios), and bringing performances of the classics to new audiences (such as factory workers and the Red Army). Several articles on Stanislavski and his system were published, but none were written by him. On 5 March 1921, Stanislavski was evicted from his large house on Carriage Row, where he had lived since 1903. Following the personal intervention of Lenin (prompted by Anatoly Lunacharsky), Stanislavski was re-housed at 6 Leontievski Lane, not far from the MAT. He was to live there until his death in 1938. On 29 May 1922, Stanislavski&#x27;s favourite pupil, the director Yevgeny Vakhtangov, died of cancer.

==MAT tours in Europe and the United States==
In the wake of the temporary withdrawal of the state subsidy to the MAT that came with the New Economic Policy in 1921, Stanislavski and Nemirovich planned a tour to Europe and the US to augment the company&#x27;s finances. The tour began in Berlin, where Stanislavski arrived on 18 September 1922, and proceeded to Prague, Zagreb, and Paris, where he was welcomed at the station by Jacques Hébertot, Aurélien Lugné-Poë, and Jacques Copeau. In Paris, he also met André Antoine, Louis Jouvet, Isadora Duncan, Firmin Gémier, and Harley Granville-Barker. He discussed with Copeau the possibility of establishing an international theatre studio and attended performances by Ermete Zacconi, whose control of his performance, economic expressivity, and ability both to &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;represent&quot; the role impressed him.

The company sailed to New York City and arrived on 4 January 1923. When reporters asked about their repertoire, Stanislavski explained that &quot;America wants to see what Europe already knows.&quot; David Belasco, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Feodor Chaliapin attended the opening night performance. Thanks in part to a vigorous publicity campaign that the American producer, Morris Gest, orchestrated, the tour garnered substantial critical praise, although it was not a financial success.

As actors (among whom was the young Lee Strasberg) flocked to the performances to learn from the company, the tour made a substantial contribution to the development of American acting. Richard Boleslavsky presented a series of lectures on Stanislavski&#x27;s system (which were eventually published as &quot;Acting: The First Six Lessons&quot; in 1933). A performance of &quot;Three Sisters&quot; on 31 March 1923 concluded the season in New York, after which they travelled to Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston.

At the request of a US publisher, Stanislavski reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, &quot;My Life in Art&quot;, since his proposals for an account of the system or a history of the MAT and its approach had been rejected. He returned to Europe during the summer where he worked on the book and, in September, began rehearsals for a second tour. The company returned to New York on 7 November and went on to perform in Philadelphia, Boston, New Haven, Hartford, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, Newark, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Detroit. On 20 March 1924, Stanislavski met President Calvin Coolidge at the White House. They were introduced by a translator, Elizabeth Hapgood, with whom he would later collaborate on &quot;An Actor Prepares&quot;. The company left the US on 17 May 1924.

==Soviet productions==
On his return to Moscow in August 1924, Stanislavski began with the help of Gurevich to make substantial revisions to his autobiography, in preparation for a definitive Russian-language edition, which was published in September 1926. He continued to act, reprising the role of Astrov in a new production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (his performance of which was described as &quot;staggering&quot;). With Nemirovich away touring with his Music Studio, Stanislavski led the MAT for two years, during which time the company thrived.

With a company fully versed in his system, Stanislavski&#x27;s work on Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot; focused on the tempo-rhythm of the production&#x27;s dramatic structure and the through-lines of action for the individual characters and the play as a whole. &quot;See everything in terms of action&quot; he advised them. Aware of the disapproval of Bulgakov felt by the Repertory Committee (&quot;Glavrepertkom&quot;) of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education, Stanislavski threatened to close the theatre if the play was banned. Despite substantial hostility from the press, the production was a box-office success.

In an attempt to render a classic play relevant to a contemporary Soviet audience, Stanislavski re-located the action in his fast and free-flowing production of Pierre Beaumarchais&#x27; 18th-century comedy &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; to pre-Revolutionary France and emphasised the democratic point of view of Figaro and Susanna, in preference to that of the aristocratic Count Almaviva. His working methods contributed innovations to the system: the analysis of scenes in terms of concrete physical tasks and the use of the &quot;line of the day&quot; for each character.

In preference to the tightly controlled, Meiningen-inspired scoring of the &quot;mise en scène&quot; with which he had choreographed crowd scenes in his early years, he now worked in terms of broad physical tasks: actors responded truthfully to the circumstances of scenes with sequences of improvised adaptations that attempted to solve concrete, physical problems. For the &quot;line of the day,&quot; an actor elaborates in detail the events that supposedly occur to the character &quot;off-stage&quot;, in order to form a continuum of experience (the &quot;line&quot; of the character&#x27;s life that day) that helps to justify his or her behaviour &quot;on-stage&quot;. This means that the actor develops a relationship to where (as a character) he has just come from and to where he intends to go when leaving the scene. The production was a great success, garnering ten curtain calls on opening night. Thanks to its cohesive unity and rhythmic qualities, it is recognised as one of Stanislavski&#x27;s major achievements.

With a performance of extracts from its major productions—including the first act of &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in which Stanislavski played Vershinin—the MAT celebrated its 30-year jubilee on 29 October 1928. While performing Stanislavski suffered a massive heart-attack, although he continued until the curtain call, after which he collapsed. With that, his acting career came to an end.

==A manual for actors==
While on holiday in August 1926, Stanislavski began to develop what would become &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot;, his manual for actors written in the form of a fictional student&#x27;s diary. Ideally, Stanislavski felt, it would consist of two volumes: the first would detail the actor&#x27;s inner experiencing and outer, physical embodiment; the second would address rehearsal processes. Since the Soviet publishers used a format that would have made the first volume unwieldy, however, in practice this became three volumes—inner experiencing, outer characterisation, and rehearsal—each of which would be published separately, as it became ready.

The danger that such an arrangement would obscure the mutual interdependence of these parts in the system as a whole would be avoided, Stanislavski hoped, by means of an initial overview that would stress their integration in his psycho-physical approach; as it turned out, however, he never wrote the overview and many English-language readers came to confuse the first volume on psychological processes—published in a heavily abridged version in the US as &quot;An Actor Prepares&quot; (1936)—with the system as a whole.

The two editors—Hapgood with the American edition and Gurevich with the Russian—made conflicting demands on Stanislavski. Gurevich became increasingly concerned that splitting &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot; into two books would not only encourage misunderstandings of the unity and mutual implication of the psychological and physical aspects of the system, but would also give its Soviet critics grounds on which to attack it: &quot;to accuse you of dualism, spiritualism, idealism, etc.&quot; Frustrated with Stanislavski&#x27;s tendency to tinker with details in preference to addressing more important missing sections, in May 1932 she terminated her involvement. Hapgood echoed Gurevich&#x27;s frustration.

In 1933, Stanislavski worked on the second half of &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot;. By 1935, a version of the first volume was ready for publication in America, to which the publishers made significant abridgements. A significantly different and far more complete Russian edition, &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work on Himself, Part I&quot;, was not published until 1938, just after Stanislavski&#x27;s death. The second part of &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work on Himself&quot; was published in the Soviet Union in 1948; an English-language variant, &quot;Building a Character&quot;, was published a year later. The third volume, &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work on a Role&quot;, was published in the Soviet Union in 1957; its nearest English-language equivalent, &quot;Creating a Role&quot;, was published in 1961. The differences between the Russian and English-language editions of volumes two and three were even greater than those of the first volume. In 2008, an English-language translation of the complete Russian edition of &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot; was published, with one of &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work on a Role&quot; following in 2010.

==Development of the Method of Physical Action==
While recuperating in Nice at the end of 1929, Stanislavski began a production plan for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. Hoping to use this as the basis for &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work on a Role&quot;, his plan offers the earliest exposition of the rehearsal process that became known as his Method of Physical Action. He first explored this approach practically in his work on &quot;Three Sisters&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1934 and &quot;Molière&quot; in 1935.

In contrast to his earlier method of working on a play—which involved extensive readings and analysis around a table before any attempt to physicalise its action—Stanislavski now encouraged his actors to explore the action through its &quot;active analysis&quot;. He felt that too much discussion in the early stages of rehearsal confused and inhibited the actors. Instead, focusing on the simplest physical actions, they improvised the sequence of dramatic situations given in the play. &quot;The best analysis of a play&quot;, he argued, &quot;is to take action in the given circumstances.&quot; If the actor justified and committed to the truth of the actions (which are easier to shape and control than emotional responses), Stanislavski reasoned, they would evoke truthful thoughts and feelings.

Stanislavski&#x27;s attitude to the use of emotion memory in rehearsals (as distinct from its use in actor training) had shifted over the years. Ideally, he felt, an instinctive identification with a character&#x27;s situation should arouse an emotional response. The use of emotion memory in lieu of that had demonstrated a propensity for encouraging self-indulgence or hysteria in the actor. Its direct approach to feeling, Stanislavski felt, more often produced a block than the desired expression. Instead, an indirect approach to the subconscious via a focus on actions (supported by a commitment to the given circumstances and imaginative &quot;Magic Ifs&quot;) was a more reliable means of luring the appropriate emotional response.

This shift in approach corresponded both with an increased attention to the structure and dynamic of the play as a whole and with a greater prominence given to the distinction between the planning of a role and its performance. In performance the actor is aware of only one step at a time, Stanislavski reasoned, but this focus risks the loss of the overall dynamic of a role in the welter of moment-to-moment detail. Consequently, the actor must also adopt a different point of view in order to plan the role in relation to its dramatic structure; this might involve adjusting the performance by holding back at certain moments and playing full out at others. A sense of the whole thereby informs the playing of each episode. Borrowing a term from Henry Irving, Stanislavski called this the &quot;perspective of the role&quot;.

Every afternoon for five weeks during the summer of 1934 in Paris, Stanislavski worked with the American actress Stella Adler, who had sought his assistance with the blocks she had confronted in her performances. Given the emphasis that emotion memory had received in New York City, Adler was surprised to find that Stanislavski rejected the technique except as a last resort. The news that this was Stanislavski&#x27;s approach would have significant repercussions in the US; Lee Strasberg angrily rejected it and refused to modify his version of the system.

==Political fortunes under Stalin==
Following his heart attack in 1928, for the last decade of his life Stanislavski conducted most of his work writing, directing rehearsals, and teaching in his home on Leontievski Lane. In line with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s policy of &quot;isolation and preservation&quot; towards certain internationally famous cultural figures, Stanislavski lived in a state of internal exile in Moscow. This protected him from the worst excesses of Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Great Terror&quot;.

A number of articles critical of the terminology of Stanislavski&#x27;s system appeared in the run-up to a RAPP conference in early 1931, at which the attacks continued. The system stood accused of philosophical idealism, of a-historicism, of disguising social and political problems under ethical and moral terms, and of &quot;biological psychologism&quot; (or &quot;the suggestion of fixed qualities in nature&quot;). In the wake of the first congress of the USSR Union of Writers (chaired by Maxim Gorky in August 1934), however, Socialist realism was established as the official party line in aesthetic matters. While the new policy would have disastrous consequences for the Soviet avant-garde, the MAT and Stanislavski&#x27;s system were enthroned as exemplary models.

==Final work at the Opera-Dramatic Studio==
Given the difficulties he had with completing his manual for actors, Stanislavski decided that he needed to found a new studio if he was to ensure his legacy. &quot;Our school will produce not just individuals,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but a whole company&quot;. In June 1935, he began to instruct a group of teachers in the training techniques of the system and the rehearsal processes of the Method of Physical Action. Twenty students (out of 3,500 auditionees) were accepted for the dramatic section of the Opera-Dramatic Studio, where classes began on 15 November. Stanislavski arranged a curriculum of four years of study that focused exclusively on technique and method—two years of the work detailed later in &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot; and two of that in &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work on a Role&quot;.

Once the students were acquainted with the training techniques of the first two years, Stanislavski selected &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for their work on roles. He worked with the students in March and April 1937, focusing on their sequences of physical actions, on establishing their through-lines of action, and on rehearsing scenes anew in terms of the actors&#x27; tasks. By June 1938 the students were ready for their first public showing, at which they performed a selection of scenes to a small number of spectators. The Opera-Dramatic Studio embodied the most complete implementation of the training exercises that Stanislavski described in his manuals.

From late 1936 onwards, Stanislavski began to meet regularly with Vsevolod Meyerhold, with whom he discussed the possibility of developing a common theatrical language. In 1938, they made plans to work together on a production and discussed a synthesis of Stanislavski&#x27;s Method of Physical Action and Meyerhold&#x27;s biomechanical training. On 8 March, Meyerhold took over the rehearsals for &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, the staging of which he completed after Stanislavski&#x27;s death. On his death-bed Stanislavski declared to Yuri Bakhrushin that Meyerhold was &quot;my sole heir in the theatre—here or anywhere else&quot;. Stalin&#x27;s police tortured and killed Meyerhold in February 1940.

Stanislavski died in his home at 3:45 pm on 7 August 1938, having probably suffered another heart-attack five days earlier. Thousands of people attended his funeral. Three weeks after his death his widow, Lilina, received an advanced copy of the Russian-language edition of the first volume of &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot;—the &quot;labour of his life&quot;, as she called it. Stanislavski was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, not far from the grave of Anton Chekhov.

<text>Khartoum or Khartum ( ; , pronounced ) is the capital city of Sudan as well as Khartoum State. With a population of 6.3 million people, Khartoum&#x27;s metropolitan area is the largest in Sudan. 

Khartoum is located at the confluence of the White Nile – flowing north from Lake Victoria – and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Divided by these two parts of the Nile, the Khartoum metropolitan area is a tripartite metropolis consisting of Khartoum proper and linked by bridges to Khartoum North ( ) and Omdurman ( ) to the west. The place where the two Niles meet is known as &quot;al-Mogran&quot; or &quot;al-Muqran&quot; (; English: &quot;The Confluence&quot;).

Khartoum was founded in 1821 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, north of the ancient city of Soba. In 1882 the British Empire took control of the Egyptian government, leaving the administration of Sudan in the hands of the Egyptians. At the outbreak of the Mahdist War, the British attempted to evacuate Anglo-Egyptian garrisons from Sudan but the Siege of Khartoum in 1884 resulted in the capture of the city by Mahdist forces and a massacre of the defending Anglo-Egyptian garrison. In 1898 it was reoccupied by British forces and was the seat of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan&#x27;s government until 1956.

In 1956, the city was designated as the capital of an independent Sudan. Three hostages were killed during the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum in 1973.

In 2008, the Justice and Equality Movement engaged in combat in the city with the Sudanese Armed Forces as part of the War in Darfur. The Khartoum massacre occurred in 2019 during the Sudanese Revolution. The city saw extensive combat during the civil war between the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), affecting Khartoum International Airport and other critical sites.

Khartoum is an economic and trade center in North Africa, with rail lines from Port Sudan and El-Obeid. It is served by Khartoum International Airport with the New Khartoum International Airport under construction. Several national and cultural institutions are in Khartoum and its metropolitan area, including the National Museum of Sudan, the Khalifa House Museum, the University of Khartoum, and the Sudan University of Science and Technology.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;Khartoum&quot; is uncertain. 
Scholars posit that the name derives from the Dinka words (Dinka-Bor dialect) or (as is the pronunciation in various Dinka dialects), translating to &quot;place where rivers meet&quot;. This is supported by historical accounts which place the Dinka homeland in central Sudan (around present-day Khartoum) as recently as the 13th-17th centuries A.D.

One folk etymology is that it is derived from Arabic ( or ), probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles. 

Captain J.A. Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke&#x27;s expedition, thought the name was most probably from the Arabic ( , i.e., &quot;Carthamus tinctorius&quot;), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel. Some scholars speculate that the word derives from the Nubian word , meaning &quot;the abode of Atum&quot;, Atum being the Nubian and Egyptian god of creation. Other Beja scholars suggest &quot;Khartoum&quot; is derived from the Beja word , &quot;meeting&quot;. Sociologist Vincent J. Donovan notes that in the Nilotic Maa language of the Maasai people, means &quot;we have acquired&quot; and that the geographical location of Khartoum is where Maasai oral tradition claims that the ancestors of the Maasai first acquired cattle.

==History==
===19th century===

In 1821, Khartoum was established north of the ancient city of Soba, by Isma&#x27;il Kamil Pasha, the third son of Egypt&#x27;s ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the Egyptian Army. Egypt shifted the seat of the colonial government from Wad Madani to Khartoum in 1823, which became a permanent settlement and underwent rapid development in the next decades. With its elevation to capital status, Khartoum quickly grew into a regional center of trade, serving as a rest area on the caravan route from Ethiopia to Egypt, but also becoming a major focal point for the slave trade.

A significant change took place in 1854, when most of the city was destroyed by heavy rains and floods. It was rebuilt with houses made out of mud and stones, replacing those made out of thatch and straw. Khartoum also became the seat of several European consulates and the Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa. European pressure and influence forced Egypt to close the city&#x27;s public slave market in 1854, although slaves continued to be sold and trafficked in large numbers, specifically from the Blue Nile region and the Nuba Mountains, as well as down the White Nile (the Dinka and Shilluk territories). According to the British explorer Samuel Baker, who visited Khartoum in 1862, slavery was the industry &quot;that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town&quot;. 

On 13 March 1884, troops loyal to the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad began the siege of Khartoum against the Egyptian garrison led by the British General Charles George Gordon. Despite being fortified by trenches and a wall connecting the Blue and White Niles, the city was conquered by the Mahdists on 26 January 1885. Many of the inhabitants were massacred or enslaved and the survivors were deported to the newly established Omdurman, while Khartoum was largely destroyed and abandoned. With the reconquest of Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1898, Khartoum was reinstated as the capital, and was rebuilt according to a street plan in the shape of the Union Jack. Khartoum Bahri was established as a garrison comprising a dockyard and a railhead to Egypt, while Omdurman, remained the most populous part and largely kept its old shape.

===20th century===
During World War II, the Italian Empire attempted to advance into Sudan from Ethiopia, with the end goal of capturing Khartoum. However, the Italian attack was repelled by British forces in Sudan.

The fourth Arab League summit was held in Khartoum on 29 August 1967.

In 1973, the city was the site of a hostage crisis in which members of Black September held 10 hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: &quot;The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.&quot;

In 1977, the first oil pipeline between Khartoum and Port Sudan was completed.

The Organization of African Unity summit of 18–22 July 1978 was held in Khartoum, during which Sudan was awarded the OAU presidency.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums on the city&#x27;s outskirts. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from South Sudan and Darfur – fleeing the violence of the Second Sudanese Civil War and Darfur conflict – have settled around Khartoum.

In 1991, Osama bin Laden purchased a house in the affluent al-Riyadh neighborhood of the city and another in Soba. He lived there until 1996, when he was banished from the country. Following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the United States accused bin Laden&#x27;s al-Qaeda group and, on 20 August, launched cruise missile attacks on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North. The factory&#x27;s destruction created diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The factory ruins are now a tourist attraction.

In November 1991, the government of President Omar al-Bashir sought to remove half the population from the city. The residents, deemed squatters, were mostly southern Sudanese whom the government feared could be potential rebel sympathizers. Around 425,000 people were placed in five &quot;Peace Camps&quot; in the desert an hour&#x27;s drive from Khartoum. The camps were watched over by heavily armed security guards, many relief agencies were banned from assisting, and &quot;the nearest food was at a market four miles away, a vast journey in the desert heat.&quot; Many residents were reduced to having only burlap sacks as housing. The intentional displacement was part of a large urban renewal plan backed by the housing minister, Sharaf Bannaga.
=== 21st century ===
The sudden death of SPLA head and vice-president of Sudan John Garang in late July 2005, was followed by three days of violent riots in the capital. Order was finally restored after southern Sudanese politicians and tribal leaders sent strong messages to the rioters. The death toll was at least 24, as youths from southern Sudan attacked northern Sudanese and clashed with security forces.

The African Union summit of 16–24 January 2006 was held in Khartoum; as was the Arab League summit of 28–29 March 2006, during which they elected Sudan the Arab League presidency.

On 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group Justice and Equality Movement attacked the city with the goal of toppling Omar al-Bashir&#x27;s government. The Sudanese government held off the assault.

On 23 October 2012, an explosion at the Yarmouk munitions factory killed two people and injured another person. The Sudanese government claimed that the explosion was the result of an Israeli airstrike.

On 3 June 2019, Khartoum was the site of the Khartoum massacre, where over 100 dissidents were murdered (the government said 61 were killed), hundreds more injured and 70 women raped by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) soldiers in order to forcefully disperse the peaceful protests calling for a civilian government.

On 1 July 2020, activists demanded that al-Zibar Basha street in Khartoum be renamed. Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur was a slave trader and the al-Zibar Basha street leads to the military base where the 2019 Khartoum massacre took place.

On 26 October 2021, the city was locked down following a military coup that left at least 7 dead, triggering protests and calls for a general strike. Prime minister Abdalla Hamdok was arrested during the coup, and held along with other cabinet members in an unknown location.

On 15 April 2023, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF broke out across Sudan, including in Khartoum. Fighting was reported at the presidential palace, the RSF&#x27;s headquarters, Khartoum International Airport and Merowe Airport, the last two of which the RSF claimed to have captured. Gunfire and clashes were also reported at El Obeid Airport in North Kordofan.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Khartoum is located at the confluence of the Blue Nile and the White Nile. 

Khartoum is relatively flat, at elevation , as the Nile flows northeast past Omdurman to Shendi, at elevation about away.

===Climate===
Khartoum features a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) with a dry season occurring during winter, typical of the Saharo-Sahelian zone, which marks the progressive passage between the Sahara Desert&#x27;s vast arid areas and the Sahel&#x27;s vast semi-arid areas. The climate is extremely dry for most of the year, with about eight months when average rainfall is lower than . The very long dry season is itself divided into a warm, very dry season between November and February, as well as a very hot, dry season between March and May. During this part of the year, hot, dry continental trade winds from deserts, such as the harmattan, sweep over the region; the weather is stable and very dry.

The very irregular, very brief, rainy season lasts about 1 month as the maximum rainfall is recorded in August, with about . The rainy season is characterized by a seasonal reverse of wind regimes, when the Intertropical Convergence Zone goes northerly. Average annual rainfall is very low, with only of precipitation. Khartoum records on average six days with or more and 19 days with or more of rainfall. The highest temperatures occur during two periods in the year: the first at the late dry season, when average high temperatures consistently exceed from April to June, and the second at the early dry season, when average high temperatures exceed in September and October. Temperatures cool off somewhat during the night, with Khartoum&#x27;s lowest average low temperature of the year, in January, just above . Khartoum is one of the hottest major cities on Earth, with annual mean temperatures hovering around . The city also has very warm winters. In no month does the average monthly high temperature fall below . This is something not seen in other major cities with hot desert climates, such as Riyadh, Baghdad and Phoenix.
==Demographics==
Almost 250,000 Syrians lived in Khartoum as of 2019, representing 5% of the total population of the city. Most are young men who have fled war in Syria. Sudan was the only country in the world to accept travelers carrying a Syrian passport who lacked a visa.

==Economy==
After the signing of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement (SPLA), the Government of Sudan began a massive development project. In 2007, the biggest projects in Khartoum were the Al-Mogran Development Project, two five-star hotels, a new airport, El Mek Nimr Bridge (finished in October 2007) and the Tuti Bridge that links Khartoum to Tuti Island.

In the 21st century, Khartoum developed based on Sudan&#x27;s oil wealth (although the independence of South Sudan in 2011 affected the economy of Sudan negatively). The center of the city has tree-lined streets. Khartoum has the highest concentration of economic activity in the country. This has changed as major economic developments take place in other parts of the country, like oil exploration in the south, the Giad Industrial Complex in Al Jazirah state and White Nile Sugar Project in Central Sudan, and the Merowe Dam in the North.

Among the city&#x27;s industries are printing, glass manufacturing, food processing, and textiles. Petroleum products are now produced in the far north of Khartoum state, providing fuel and jobs for the city. One of Sudan&#x27;s largest refineries is located in northern Khartoum.

===Retailing===
The Souq al Arabi is Khartoum&#x27;s largest open air market. The souq is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold.

Al Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous high streets in Khartoum State.

Afra Mall is located in the southern suburb of Arkeweet. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children&#x27;s playground.

In 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Corinthia Hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.

==Education==


Khartoum is the main location for most of Sudan&#x27;s top educational bodies. There are four main levels of education:
# Kindergarten and day-care. It begins in the age of 3–4, consists of 1-2 grades, (depending on the parents).
# Elementary school. The first grade pupils enter at the age of 6–7. It consists of 8 grades, after which, at 13–14 years old, students are ready to take the certificate exams and enter high school.
# Upper second school and high school. In these three the school methods add some main academic subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics, and geography. There are three grades in this level. The students&#x27; ages are about 14–15 to 17–18.
# Higher education. There are several universities and colleges in Khartoum, including the University of Khartoum and Sudan University of Science and Technology.

==Transportation==
Khartoum is home to the largest airport in Sudan, Khartoum International Airport. It is the main hub for Sudan Airways, Sudan&#x27;s main carrier. A new airport was planned for the southern outskirts of the city, but with Khartoum&#x27;s rapid growth and consequent urban sprawl, the airport is still located in the heart of the city.

Khartoum&#x27;s transportation is limited to the vehicular road system, with buses and personal vehicles comprising the main types of vehicles. As with many cities in the continent, parts of Khartoum are connected through privately owned buses.
Khartoum has a number of bridges across both tributaries of the Nile. The Mac Nimir Bridge, the Blue Nile Road &amp; Railway Bridge, the Cooper Bridge (also known as the Armed Forces Bridge), and the Elmansheya Bridge span the Blue Nile, connecting Khartoum to Khartoum North. The Omdurman Bridge, the Victory Bridge, and the Al-Dabbasin Bridge span the White Nile, connecting Khartoum to Omdurman. The Tuti Bridge connects Tuti Island with Khartoum. Prior to the construction of the Tuti Bridge in 2008, residents of Tuti Island relied on water taxis to cross the Blue Nile into Khartoum.

Khartoum has rail lines from Wadi Halfa, Port Sudan on the Red Sea, and El Obeid. All are operated by Sudan Railways.

== Architecture ==

The architecture of Khartoum reflects the city&#x27;s history since the early 1820s and is marked by both native Sudanese, Turkish, British and modern buildings. In general, the architecture of Sudan reflects a wide diversity in its shapes, materials, and use.

Since independence, the people of Sudan have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques.

==Culture==
===Museums===
The largest museum in Sudan is the National Museum of Sudan. Founded in 1971, it contains works from different epochs of Sudanese history. Among the exhibits are two Egyptian temples of Buhen and Semna, originally built by Pharaoh Hatshepsut and Pharaoh Tuthmosis III, respectively, but relocated to Khartoum upon the flooding of Lake Nasser.

The Republican Palace Museum, opened in 2000, is located in the former Anglican All Saints&#x27; cathedral on Sharia al-Jama&#x27;a, next to the historical Presidential Palace.

The Ethnographic Museum is located on Sharia al-Jama&#x27;a, close to the Mac Nimir Bridge.

===Botanical gardens===
Khartoum is home to one of the oldest botanical gardens in Africa, National Botanical Garden in the Mogran district of the city.

===Clubs===
Khartoum is home to several clubs, including the Blue Nile Sailing Club, social clubs such as the German Club, the Greek Club, as well as football clubs Al Khartoum SC and Al Ahli Khartoum.

=== Places of worship ===
The places of worship in Khartoum primarily consist of Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Coptic Orthodox Church, St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral, Khartoum, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches).

== In popular culture ==

=== Literature ===
Khartoum&#x27;s unique history and cultural significance have inspired literary works that explore its past, present, and future. For example, in &quot;Reading Khartoum&quot;, the city is depicted as a space shaped by movement, political instability, and socio-cultural changes, resulting in underlying layers of meanings and ambiguity. Arabic-written poetry also offers a personalized glimpse of the city, reflecting its distinct cultural appearance and setting it apart from other Arab and African cities.

<doc id="17322" wikidata="Q306140" url="?curid=17322" title="Α-Ketoglutaric acid">
<text>α-Ketoglutaric acid is an organic compound with the formula ). A white, nontoxic solid, it is a common dicarboxylic acid. Relevant to its biological roles, it exists in water as its conjugate base α-ketoglutarate. It is also classified as a 2-ketocarboxylic acid. β-Ketoglutaric acid is an isomer. &quot;Ketoglutaric acid&quot; and &quot;ketoglutarate&quot;, when not qualified as α or β, almost always refers respectively to α-ketoglutaric acid or α-ketoglutarate. 

α-Ketoglutarate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, a cycle that supplies the energy to cells. It is also an intermediate in or product of several other metabolic pathways. These include its being a component of metabolic pathways that: make amino acids and in the process regulate the cellular levels of carbon, nitrogen, and ammonia; reduce the cellular levels of potentially toxic reactive oxygen species; and synthesize the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It also acts as a direct stimulator of, or cofactor (i.e., required for but does not itself stimulate) for various cellular functions as defined in studies that are primarily preclinical (i.e., conducted in animal models of disease or on animal or human tissues). These studies have provided evidence that α-ketoglutarate contributes to regulating: kidney function; the benefits that resistance exercise has in reducing obesity, strengthening muscles, and preventing muscle atrophy; glucose tolerance as defined in glucose tolerance tests; aging and the development of changes that are associated with aging including old age-related disorders and diseases; the development and/or progression of certain types of cancer and inflammations; and the differentiation of immature T cells into mature T cells.

==Functions==
===Metabolic interactions===
====Citric acid cycle====
α-Ketoglutarate is a component of the citric acid cycle, a cyclical metabolic pathway located in the mitochondria. This cycle supplies the energy that cells need by sequentially metabolizing (indicated by →) citrate through seven intermediate metabolites and then converting the eighth intermediate metabolite, oxaloacetate, back to citrate:

:::::citrate → cis-aconitate → isocitrate → α-ketoglutarate → succinyl-CoA → succinate → fumarate → malate → oxaloacetate → citrate

In this cycle, the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 converts isocitrate (isocitrate has 4 isomers of which only the (−)-d-threo-isomer is the naturally occurring isomer in the citric acid cycle.) to α-ketoglutarate which in the next step is converted to succinyl-CoA by the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of enzymes. 

Aside from the citric acid cycle, α-ketoglutarate is made by a) glutaminolysis in which the enzyme glutaminase removes the amino group from glutamine to form glutamate which is converted to α-ketoglutarate by any one of three enzymes, glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase, or aspartate transaminase (see The glutaminolytic pathways); and various pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination reactions mediated by, e.g., the alanine transaminase enzyme, in which glutamate is converted to α-Ketoglutarate by &quot;donating&quot; its to other compounds (see transamination). Acting in these pathways, α-ketoglutarate contributes to the production of amino acids such as glutamine, proline, arginine, and lysine as well as the lowering of cellular carbon and nitrogen (i.e., N) levels; this prevents excessive levels of these two potentially toxic elements from accumulating in cells and tissues. The neurotoxin, ammonia (i.e., ), is also prevented form accumulating in tissues. In this metabolic pathway the group on an amino acid is transferred to α-ketoglutarate; this forms the α-keto acid of the original amino acid and the amine-containing product of α-ketoglutarate, glutamate. The celllular glutamate passes into the circulation and is taken up by the liver where it delivers its acquired group to the urea cycle. In effect, the latter pathway removes excess ammonia from the body in the form of urinary urea.

====Reactive oxygen species====
α-Ketoglutarate is one of the non-enzymatic antioxidant agents. It reacts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form succinate, carbon dioxide (i.e., ), and water (i.e., () thereby lowering the levels of H2O2. Additionally, α-ketoglutarate increases the activity of superoxide dismutase, which converts the highly toxic () radical to molecular oxygen (i.e., O2) and .

====Formation of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid====
A study conducted on the GABAergic neurons (i.e., nerve cells) in the neocortex of rat brains reported that the cytosolic form of the aspartate transaminase enzyme metabolizes α-ketoglutarate to glutamate which in turn is metabolized by glutamic acid decarboxylase to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. These metabolic reactions occur at the ends of the inhibitory axons of the GABAergic neurons and result in the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid which then inhibits the activation of nearby neurons.

===Bioactions of α-Ketoglutarate===
====OXGR1 receptor-dependent bioactions====
OXGR1 (also known as GPR99) is a G protein-coupled receptor, i.e., a receptor located on the surface membrane of cells that binds certain ligands and is thereby stimulated to activate G proteins that elicit pre-programmed responses in their parent cells. OXRG1 was identified as a receptor for: a) α-ketoglutarate in 2004; b) three leukotrienes viz., leukotrienes E4, C4, and D4 in 2013. and c) itaconate in 2023. These ligands have the following relative potencies in stimulating responses in OXGR1-bearing cells (Note that LTE4 can stimulate OXGR1 at concentrations far lower than those of the other four ligands):

:::LTE4 » LTC4 = LTD4 &gt; α-ketoglutarate = itaconate.

It may be difficult to determine if an OXGR1-stimulating agent elicits a functional response by activating OXGR1 as opposed to some other mechanism. To make this distinction, studies have shown that the action of an OXGR1-activating agent on cultured cells, cultured tissues, or animals does not occur or is reduced when these cells, tissues, or animals have been altered so that they do not express or express greatly reduced levels of the OXGR1 protein, or when their actions are inhibited by an OXGR1 receptor antagonists. OXGR1 is inhibited by Montelukast, a well-known inhibitor of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, i.e., the receptor for LTD4, LTC4, and LTE4. Montelukast also blocks the binding of these leukotrienes to, and thereby inhibits their activation of, OXGR1. One study presented evidence suggesting that α-ketoglutarate binds to OXGR1. It is assumed that Montelukast similarly blocks α-ketoglutarate&#x27;s binding to, and thereby inhibits its activation of OXGR1.

====Kidney functions====
The pendrin protein promotes the electroneutral exchange of tissue chloride (Cl−) for urinary bicarbonate (HCO3−) in the apical surfaces (i.e., surfaces facing the urine) of the kidney&#x27;s renal β-intercalated cells (also termed type B intercalated cells) and non-α non-β intercalated cells (also termed non-A non-B intercalated cells) in the kidney&#x27;s collecting duct system (i.e., CDS). A study in mice found that OXGR1 colocalizes with pendrin in the β-intercalated cells and non-α non-β intercalated cells lining the tubules of their kidney&#x27;s CDS. The intercalated cells in the CDS tubules isolated from mice used pendrin in cooperation with the electroneutral sodium bicarbonate exchanger 1 protein to mediate the Cl− for HCO3− exchange. α-Ketoglutarate stimulated the rate of this exchange in CDS tubules isolated from control mice (i.e., mice that had the &quot;Oxgr1&quot; gene and protein) but not in CDS tubules isolated from &quot;Oxgr1&quot; gene knockout mice (i.e., mice that lacked the &quot;Oxgr1&quot; gene and protein). This study also showed that the α-ketoglutarate in the blood of mice filtered through their kidney&#x27;s glomeruli into the proximal tubules and loops of Henle where it was reabsorbed. Mice drinking water with a basic pH (i.e., &gt;7) due to the addition of sodium bicarbonate and mice lacking the &quot;Oxgr1&quot; gene and protein who drink water without sodium bicarbonate had urines that were more basic (i.e., pH about 7.8) and contained higher levels of urinary α-ketoglutarate than control mice drinking water without this additive. Furthermore, &quot;Oxgr1&quot; gene knockout mice drinking sodium bicarbonate-rich water developed metabolic alkalosis (body tissue pH levels higher than normal) that was associated with blood bicarbonate levels significantly higher and blood chloride levels significantly lower than those in control mice drinking the sodium bicarbonate-rich water. Several other studies confirmed these findings and reported that cells in the proximal tubules of mice synthesize α-ketoglutarate and either broke it down thereby reducing its urine levels or secreted it into the tubules&#x27; lumens thereby increasing its urine levels. Another study showed that a) &quot;In silico&quot; computer simulations strongly suggested that α-ketoglutarate bound to mouse OXGPR1; b) suspensions of canal duct cells isolated from the collecting ducts, loops of Henle, vasa recta, and interstitium of mouse kidneys raised their cytosolic ionic calcium, i.e., Ca2+ levels in response to α-ketoglutarate but this response (which is an indicator of cell activation) was blocked by pretreating the cells with Montelukast; and c) compared to mice not treated with streptozotocin, streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (an animal disease model of diabetes) urinated only a small amount of the ionic sodium () that they drank or received by intravenous injections; Montelukast reversed this defect in the streptozotocin-pretreated mice. These results indicate that in mice: a) α-ketoglutarate stimulates kidney OXGR1 to activate pendrin-mediated reabsorption of sodium and chloride by type B and non-A–non-B intercalated cells; b) high alkaline (i.e., sodium bicarbonate) intake produces significant increases in urine pH and α-ketoglutarate levels and impairs secretion of bicarbonate into the CDS tubules&#x27; lumens; c) the acid–base balance (i.e., levels of acids relative to their bases) in the face of high alkali intake depends on the activation of OXGR1 by α-ketoglutarate; d) alkaline loading directly or indirectly stimulates α-ketoglutarate secretion into the kidney&#x27;s proximal tubules where further down these tubules it activates OXGR1 and thereby the absorption and secretion of various agents that contribute to restoring a physiologically normal acid-base balance; and e) α-ketoglutarate stimulates OXGR1-bearing CDS cells to raise their levels of cytosolic Ca2+) and in diabetic mice (and presumably other conditions involving high levels of blood and/or urine glucose) to increase these cells uptake of .

====Resistance exercise, obesity, and muscle atrophy====
Resistance exercise is exercising a muscle or muscle group against external resistance (see strength training). Studies have found that: a) mice feeding on a high fat or normal diet and given the resistance exercise of repeatedly climbing up a 1 meter ladder for 40 minutes had higher levels of α-ketoglutarate in their blood and seven muscles than non-exercising mice feeding respectively on the high fat or normal diet; b) mice conducting ladder climbing for several weeks and eating a high fat diet developed lower fat tissue masses and higher lean tissue masses than non-exercising mice on this diet; c) mice not in exercise training fed α-ketoglutarate likewise developed lower fat tissue and higher lean tissue masses than α-ketoglutarate-unfed, non-exercising mice; d) OXGR1 was strongly expressed in the mouse adrenal gland inner medullas and either resistance training or oral α-ketoglutarate increased this tissue&#x27;s levels of the mRNA that is responsible for the synthesis of OXGR1; e) α-ketoglutarate stimulated chromaffin cells isolated from mouse adrenal glands to release epinephrine but reduction of these cells&#x27; OXGR1 levels by small interfering RNA reduced this response; f) α-ketoglutarate increased the blood serum levels of epinephrine in mice expressing OXGR1 but not in &quot;Oxgr1&quot; gene knockout mice (i.e., mice lacking the &quot;OXGR1&quot; gene and protein); g) mice on the high fat diet challenged with α-ketoglutarate increased their blood serum levels of epinephrine and developed lower fat tissue masses and higher lean tissue masses but neither &quot;OXGR1&quot; gene knockout mice nor mice that had only their adrenal glands&#x27; &quot;OXGR1&quot; gene knocked out showed these responses; and h) &quot;OXGR1&quot; gene knockout mice fed the high fat diet developed muscle protein degradation, muscle atrophy (i.e., wasting), and falls in body weight whereas control mice did not show these fat diet-induced changes. These findings indicate that in mice resistance exercise increases muscle production as well as serum levels of α-ketoglutarate which in turn suppresses diet-induced obesity (i.e., low body fat and high lean body masses) at least in part by stimulating the OXGR1 on adrenal gland chromaffin cells to release epinephrine. Another study reported that middle‐aged, i.e., 10‐month‐old, mice had lower serum levels of α-ketoglutarate than 2‐month‐old mice. Middle aged mice fed a high fat diet gained body weight and fat mass in the lower parts of their bodies and had impaired glucose tolerance as defined in glucose tolerance tests. Adding α-ketoglutarate to the drinking water of these mice inhibited the development of these changes. These results suggest that drinking the α-ketoglutarate-rich water replenished the otherwise diminished supplies of α-ketoglutarate in middle aged mice; the replenished supply of α-ketoglutarate thereby became available to suppress obesity and improve glucose tolerance. Finally, a study in rats feed a low fat or high fat diet for 27 weeks and drinking α-ketoglutarate-rich water for the last 12 weeks of this 27 week period decreased their fat issue masses and increased their whole-body insulin sensitivity as defined in glucose tolerance tests. Rats fed either of these diets but not given α-ketoglutarate-rich water did not show these changes. This study indicates that α-ketoglutarate regulates body fat mass and insulin sensitivity in rats as well as mice.

===OXGR1 receptor-independent bioactions===
The following actions of α-ketoglutarate have not been evaluated for their dependency on activating OXGR1 and are here assumed to be OXGR1-independent. Futures studies are needed to determine if OXGR1 contributes in whole or part to these actions of α-ketoglutarate.

====Aging and diseases associated with aging====
α-Ketoglutarate has been reported to increase the life span and/or delay the development of old age-related diseases in a species of roundworms and in mice. It nearly doubled the life span and delayed age-related deteriorations (e.g., decline in rapid, coordinated body movements) of &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; roundworms when added to their cell cultures. Similarly, mice fed a diet high in calcium-bound α-ketoglutarate had a longer life span and shorter length of time in which they suffered old age-related morbidities (e.g., increased frailty, hair loss, and changes in body weight). Cell cultures of splenocytes (i.e., primarily T cells) from the α-ketoglutarate-fed mice produced higher levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10, than splenocytes from mice not fed α-ketoglutarate. (Chronic low-grade inflammation which might be inhibited by interleukin-10, is associated with the development of old age-related disorders and diseases.)

As individuals age, their DNA develops additions of a methyl group (-) to a cystine adjacent to a guanine (termed a CpG island) in an increasing number of CpG islands close to certain genes. These methylations often suppress the expression of the genes to which they are close. Assays (termed epigenetic clock tests) that determine the presence of methylations of cystines in CpG islands for genes have been used to define an individual&#x27;s biological age. The Rejuvant® study reported that the median and range of the biological age of females before treatment was 62.15 (range, 46.4 to 73) years and fell to 55.55 (range 33.4 to 63.7) years after an average of 7 months treatment. These values for men were 61.85 (range 41.9 to 79.7) years before and 53.3 (33 to 74.9) years after treatment. Overall, the combined group of males and females showed an average fall in biological age of 8 years compared to before treatment. The &quot;p&quot;-value for this difference was extraordinarily significant, i.e., 6.538x10-12, in showing that this treatment decreased the participants&#x27; biological ages. However, the study did not: a) include a control group (i.e., concurrent study of individuals taking a placebo instead of Rejuvant®); b) determine if the retinyl palmitate, vitamin A, and/or calcium given with α-ketoglutarate contributed to the changes in biological ages; and c) disclose which genes were tracked for the methylation of their CpG island. The study recommended that studies need to include control groups taking a placebo or the appropriate dosages of retinyl palmitate, vitamin A, and calcium. Also, TruMe Labs, who were the maker and marketer of the biological age assay used in this study, sponsored part of the study and contributed three of its employees as authors to the study.

====Fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes and TET enzymes====
α-Ketoglutarate is a cofactor that activates histone-lysine demethylase protein superfamily. This superfamily consists of two groups, the FAD-dependent amine oxidases which do not require α-ketoglutarate for activation and the Fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (Fe2+ is the ferrous form of iron, i.e., Fe2+). The latter group of more than 30 enzymes is classified into 7 subfamilies termed histone lysine demethylases, i.e., HDM2 to HDM7, with each subfamily having multiple members. These HDMs are characterized by containing a Jumonji C (JmjC) protein domain. They function as dioxygenases or hydroxylases to remove methyl groups from the lysine residues on the histones enveloping DNA and thereby alter the expression of diverse genes. These altered gene expressions lead to a wide range of changes in the functions of various cell types and thereby caused the development and/or progression of various cancers, pathological inflammations, and other disorders (see α-Ketoglutarate-dependent demethylase biological functions). The TET enzymes (i.e., ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase family of enzymes) consists of three members, TET-1, TET-2, and TET-3. Like the Fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, all three TET enzymes require Fe2+ and α-ketoglutarate as cofactors to become activated. Unlike the dioxygenases, however, they remove methyl groups from the 5-methylcytosines of DNA sites that regulate the expression of nearby genes. These demethylations have a variety of effects including, similar to the Fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, alteration of the development and/or progression of various cancers, immune responses, and other disorders (see functions of TET enzymes).

=====β-Ketoglutaric acid and TET-2=====
β-Ketoglutaric acid has been detected in the saliva of individuals chewing betel quid, a complex mixture derived from betel nuts mixed with various other materials. Chronic chewing betel quid is associated with the development of certain cancers, particularly those in the oral cavity. The study showed that β-ketoglutaric acid bound to the cancer-promoting protein TET-2 thereby inhibiting α-ketoglutarate&#x27;s binding to this protein. Since α-ketoglutarate&#x27;s binding of TET-2 is thought to be required for it to activate TET-2, the study suggested that β-ketoglutaric acid may not fulfill the requirements for TET-2 to be activatable and therefore may prove able to block α-ketoglutarate&#x27;s cancer-promoting as well as inflammation-promoting and other actions that involve its activation of TET-2.

====Immune regulation====
Under glutamine-deprived conditions, α-ketoglutarate promotes naïve CD4+ T cells differentiation into inflammation-promoting Th1 cells while inhibiting their differentiation into inflammation-inhibiting Treg cells thereby promoting certain inflammation responses.

<text>Keynesian economics ( ; sometimes Keynesianism, named after British economist John Maynard Keynes) are the various macroeconomic theories and models of how aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) strongly influences economic output and inflation. In the Keynesian view, aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy. It is influenced by a host of factors that sometimes behave erratically and impact production, employment, and inflation.

Keynesian economists generally argue that aggregate demand is volatile and unstable and that, consequently, a market economy often experiences inefficient macroeconomic outcomes, including recessions when demand is too low and inflation when demand is too high. Further, they argue that these economic fluctuations can be mitigated by economic policy responses coordinated between a government and their central bank. In particular, fiscal policy actions taken by the government and monetary policy actions taken by the central bank, can help stabilize economic output, inflation, and unemployment over the business cycle. Keynesian economists generally advocate a regulated market economy – predominantly private sector, but with an active role for government intervention during recessions and depressions.

Keynesian economics developed during and after the Great Depression from the ideas presented by Keynes in his 1936 book, &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;. Keynes&#x27; approach was a stark contrast to the aggregate supply-focused classical economics that preceded his book. Interpreting Keynes&#x27;s work is a contentious topic, and several schools of economic thought claim his legacy.

Keynesian economics, as part of the neoclassical synthesis, served as the standard macroeconomic model in the developed nations during the later part of the Great Depression, World War II, and the post-war economic expansion (1945–1973). It was developed in part to attempt to explain the Great Depression and to help economists understand future crises. It lost some influence following the oil shock and resulting stagflation of the 1970s. Keynesian economics was later redeveloped as New Keynesian economics, becoming part of the contemporary new neoclassical synthesis, that forms current-day mainstream macroeconomics. The advent of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 sparked renewed interest in Keynesian policies by governments around the world.

==Historical context==
===Pre-Keynesian macroeconomics ===
Macroeconomics is the study of the factors applying to an economy as a whole. Important macroeconomic variables include the overall price level, the interest rate, the level of employment, and income (or equivalently output) measured in real terms.

The classical tradition of partial equilibrium theory had been to split the economy into separate markets, each of whose equilibrium conditions could be stated as a single equation determining a single variable. The theoretical apparatus of supply and demand curves developed by Fleeming Jenkin and Alfred Marshall provided a unified mathematical basis for this approach, which the Lausanne School generalized to general equilibrium theory.

For macroeconomics, relevant partial theories included the Quantity theory of money determining the price level and the classical theory of the interest rate. In regards to employment, the condition referred to by Keynes as the &quot;first postulate of classical economics&quot; stated that the wage is equal to the marginal product, which is a direct application of the marginalist principles developed during the nineteenth century (see &quot;The General Theory&quot;). Keynes sought to supplant all three aspects of the classical theory.

=== Precursors of Keynesianism ===

Although Keynes&#x27;s work was crystallized and given impetus by the advent of the Great Depression, it was part of a long-running debate within economics over the existence and nature of general gluts. A number of the policies Keynes advocated to address the Great Depression (notably government deficit spending at times of low private investment or consumption), and many of the theoretical ideas he proposed (effective demand, the multiplier, the paradox of thrift), had been advanced by authors in the 19th and early 20th centuries. (E.g. J. M. Robertson raised the paradox of thrift in 1892.) Keynes&#x27;s unique contribution was to provide a &quot;general theory&quot; of these, which proved acceptable to the economic establishment.

An intellectual precursor of Keynesian economics was underconsumption theories associated with John Law, Thomas Malthus, the Birmingham School of Thomas Attwood, and the American economists William Trufant Foster and Waddill Catchings, who were influential in the 1920s and 1930s. Underconsumptionists were, like Keynes after them, concerned with failure of aggregate demand to attain potential output, calling this &quot;underconsumption&quot; (focusing on the demand side), rather than &quot;overproduction&quot; (which would focus on the supply side), and advocating economic interventionism. Keynes specifically discussed underconsumption (which he wrote &quot;under-consumption&quot;) in the &quot;General Theory,&quot; in Chapter 22, Section IV and Chapter 23, Section VII.

Numerous concepts were developed earlier and independently of Keynes by the Stockholm school during the 1930s; these accomplishments were described in a 1937 article, published in response to the 1936 &quot;General Theory,&quot; sharing the Swedish discoveries.

===Keynes&#x27;s early writings===
In 1923, Keynes published his first contribution to economic theory, &quot;A Tract on Monetary Reform&quot;, whose point of view is classical but incorporates ideas that later played a part in the &quot;General Theory&quot;. In particular, looking at the hyperinflation in European economies, he drew attention to the opportunity cost of holding money (identified with inflation rather than interest) and its influence on the velocity of circulation.

In 1930, he published &quot;A Treatise on Money&quot;, intended as a comprehensive treatment of its subject &quot;which would confirm his stature as a serious academic scholar, rather than just as the author of stinging polemics&quot;, and marks a large step in the direction of his later views. In it, he attributes unemployment to wage stickiness and treats saving and investment as governed by independent decisions: the former varying positively with the interest rate, the latter negatively. The velocity of circulation is expressed as a function of the rate of interest. He interpreted his treatment of liquidity as implying a purely monetary theory of interest.

Keynes&#x27;s younger colleagues of the Cambridge Circus and Ralph Hawtrey believed that his arguments implicitly assumed full employment, and this influenced the direction of his subsequent work. During 1933, he wrote essays on various economic topics &quot;all of which are cast in terms of movement of output as a whole&quot;.

===Development of &quot;The General Theory&quot;===
At the time that Keynes wrote the General Theory, it had been a tenet of mainstream economic thought that the economy would automatically revert to a state of general equilibrium: it had been assumed that, because the needs of consumers are always greater than the capacity of the producers to satisfy those needs, everything that is produced would eventually be consumed once the appropriate price was found for it. This perception is reflected in Say&#x27;s law and in the writing of David Ricardo, which states that individuals produce so that they can either consume what they have manufactured or sell their output so that they can buy someone else&#x27;s output. This argument rests upon the assumption that if a surplus of goods or services exists, they would naturally drop in price to the point where they would be consumed.

Given the backdrop of high and persistent unemployment during the Great Depression, Keynes argued that there was no guarantee that the goods that individuals produce would be met with adequate effective demand, and periods of high unemployment could be expected, especially when the economy was contracting in size. He saw the economy as unable to maintain itself at full employment automatically, and believed that it was necessary for the government to step in and put purchasing power into the hands of the working population through government spending. Thus, according to Keynesian theory, some individually rational microeconomic-level actions such as not investing savings in the goods and services produced by the economy, if taken collectively by a large proportion of individuals and firms, can lead to outcomes wherein the economy operates below its potential output and growth rate.

Prior to Keynes, a situation in which aggregate demand for goods and services did not meet supply was referred to by classical economists as a &quot;general glut&quot;, although there was disagreement among them as to whether a general glut was possible. Keynes argued that when a glut occurred, it was the over-reaction of producers and the laying off of workers that led to a fall in demand and perpetuated the problem. Keynesians therefore advocate an active stabilization policy to reduce the amplitude of the business cycle, which they rank among the most serious of economic problems. According to the theory, government spending can be used to increase aggregate demand, thus increasing economic activity, reducing unemployment and deflation.

===Origins of the multiplier===
The Liberal Party fought the 1929 General Election on a promise to &quot;reduce levels of unemployment to normal within one year by utilising the stagnant labour force in vast schemes of national development&quot;. David Lloyd George launched his campaign in March with a policy document, &quot;We can cure unemployment,&quot; which tentatively claimed that, &quot;Public works would lead to a second round of spending as the workers spent their wages.&quot; Two months later Keynes, then nearing completion of his &quot;Treatise on money&quot;, and Hubert Henderson collaborated on a political pamphlet seeking to &quot;provide academically respectable economic arguments&quot; for Lloyd George&#x27;s policies. It was titled &quot;Can Lloyd George do it?&quot; and endorsed the claim that &quot;greater trade activity would make for greater trade activity ... with a cumulative effect&quot;. This became the mechanism of the &quot;ratio&quot; published by Richard Kahn in his 1931 paper &quot;The relation of home investment to unemployment&quot;, described by Alvin Hansen as &quot;one of the great landmarks of economic analysis&quot;. The &quot;ratio&quot; was soon rechristened the &quot;multiplier&quot; at Keynes&#x27;s suggestion.

The multiplier of Kahn&#x27;s paper is based on a respending mechanism familiar nowadays from textbooks. Samuelson puts it as follows:
Let&#x27;s suppose that I hire unemployed resources to build a $1000 woodshed. My carpenters and lumber producers will get an extra $1000 of income... If they all have a marginal propensity to consume of 2/3, they will now spend $666.67 on new consumption goods. The producers of these goods will now have extra incomes... they in turn will spend $444.44 ... Thus an endless chain of &quot;secondary consumption respending&quot; is set in motion by my &quot;primary&quot; investment of $1000.
Samuelson&#x27;s treatment closely follows Joan Robinson&#x27;s account of 1937 and is the main channel by which the multiplier has influenced Keynesian theory. It differs significantly from Kahn&#x27;s paper and even more from Keynes&#x27;s book.

The designation of the initial spending as &quot;investment&quot; and the employment-creating respending as &quot;consumption&quot; echoes Kahn faithfully, though he gives no reason why initial consumption or subsequent investment respending should not have exactly the same effects. Henry Hazlitt, who considered Keynes as much a culprit as Kahn and Samuelson, wrote that ...
... in connection with the multiplier (and indeed most of the time) what Keynes is referring to as &quot;investment&quot; really means &quot;any addition to spending for any purpose&quot;... The word &quot;investment&quot; is being used in a Pickwickian, or Keynesian, sense.

Kahn envisaged money as being passed from hand to hand, creating employment at each step, until it came to rest in a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; (Hansen&#x27;s term was &quot;leakage&quot;); the only &quot;culs-de-sac&quot; he acknowledged were imports and hoarding, although he also said that a rise in prices might dilute the multiplier effect. Jens Warming recognised that personal saving had to be considered, treating it as a &quot;leakage&quot; (p. 214) while recognising on p. 217 that it might in fact be invested.

The textbook multiplier gives the impression that making society richer is the easiest thing in the world: the government just needs to spend more. In Kahn&#x27;s paper, it is harder. For him, the initial expenditure must not be a diversion of funds from other uses, but an increase in the total expenditure: something impossible – if understood in real terms – under the classical theory that the level of expenditure is limited by the economy&#x27;s income/output. On page 174, Kahn rejects the claim that the effect of public works is at the expense of expenditure elsewhere, admitting that this might arise if the revenue is raised by taxation, but says that other available means have no such consequences. As an example, he suggests that the money may be raised by borrowing from banks, since ...
... it is always within the power of the banking system to advance to the Government the cost of the roads without in any way affecting the flow of investment along the normal channels.
This assumes that banks are free to create resources to answer any demand. But Kahn adds that ...
... no such hypothesis is really necessary. For it will be demonstrated later on that, &quot;pari passu&quot; with the building of roads, funds are released from various sources at precisely the rate that is required to pay the cost of the roads.

The demonstration relies on &quot;Mr Meade&#x27;s relation&quot; (due to James Meade) asserting that the total amount of money that disappears into &quot;culs-de-sac&quot; is equal to the original outlay, which in Kahn&#x27;s words &quot;should bring relief and consolation to those who are worried about the monetary sources&quot; (p. 189).

A respending multiplier had been proposed earlier by Hawtrey in a 1928 Treasury memorandum (&quot;with imports as the only leakage&quot;), but the idea was discarded in his own subsequent writings. Soon afterwards the Australian economist Lyndhurst Giblin published a multiplier analysis in a 1930 lecture (again with imports as the only leakage). The idea itself was much older. Some Dutch mercantilists had believed in an infinite multiplier for military expenditure (assuming no import &quot;leakage&quot;), since ...
... a war could support itself for an unlimited period if only money remained in the country ... For if money itself is &quot;consumed&quot;, this simply means that it passes into someone else&#x27;s possession, and this process may continue indefinitely. Multiplier doctrines had subsequently been expressed in more theoretical terms by the Dane Julius Wulff (1896), the Australian Alfred de Lissa (late 1890s), the German/American Nicholas Johannsen (same period), and the Dane Fr. Johannsen (1925/1927). Kahn himself said that the idea was given to him as a child by his father.

===Public policy debates===
As the 1929 election approached &quot;Keynes was becoming a strong public advocate of capital development&quot; as a public measure to alleviate unemployment. Winston Churchill, the Conservative Chancellor, took the opposite view:
It is the orthodox Treasury dogma, steadfastly held ... [that] very little additional employment and no permanent additional employment can, in fact, be created by State borrowing and State expenditure.
Keynes pounced on a flaw in the Treasury view. Cross-examining Sir Richard Hopkins, a Second Secretary in the Treasury, before the Macmillan Committee on Finance and Industry in 1930 he referred to the &quot;first proposition&quot; that &quot;schemes of capital development are of no use for reducing unemployment&quot; and asked whether &quot;it would be a misunderstanding of the Treasury view to say that they hold to the first proposition&quot;. Hopkins responded that &quot;The first proposition goes much too far. The first proposition would ascribe to us an absolute and rigid dogma, would it not?&quot;

Later the same year, speaking in a newly created Committee of Economists, Keynes tried to use Kahn&#x27;s emerging multiplier theory to argue for public works, &quot;but Pigou&#x27;s and Henderson&#x27;s objections ensured that there was no sign of this in the final product&quot;. In 1933 he gave wider publicity to his support for Kahn&#x27;s multiplier in a series of articles titled &quot;The road to prosperity&quot; in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper.

A. C. Pigou was at the time the sole economics professor at Cambridge. He had a continuing interest in the subject of unemployment, having expressed the view in his popular &quot;Unemployment&quot; (1913) that it was caused by &quot;maladjustment between wage-rates and demand&quot; – a view Keynes may have shared prior to the years of the &quot;General Theory&quot;. Nor were his practical recommendations very different: &quot;on many occasions in the thirties&quot; Pigou &quot;gave public support [...] to State action designed to stimulate employment&quot;. Where the two men differed is in the link between theory and practice. Keynes was seeking to build theoretical foundations to support his recommendations for public works while Pigou showed no disposition to move away from classical doctrine. Referring to him and Dennis Robertson, Keynes asked rhetorically: &quot;Why do they insist on maintaining theories from which their own practical conclusions cannot possibly follow?&quot;

==The &quot;General Theory&quot;==
Keynes set forward the ideas that became the basis for Keynesian economics in his main work, &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; (1936). It was written during the Great Depression, when unemployment rose to 25% in the United States and as high as 33% in some countries. It is almost wholly theoretical, enlivened by occasional passages of satire and social commentary. The book had a profound impact on economic thought, and ever since it was published there has been debate over its meaning.

===Keynes and classical economics===
Keynes begins the &quot;General Theory&quot; with a summary of the classical theory of employment, which he encapsulates in his formulation of Say&#x27;s Law as the dictum &quot;Supply creates its own demand&quot;.
He also wrote that although his theory was explained in terms of an Anglo-Saxon &quot;laissez faire&quot; economy, his theory was also more general in the sense that it would be easier to adapt to &quot;totalitarian states&quot; than a free market policy would.

Under the classical theory, the wage rate is determined by the marginal productivity of labour, and as many people are employed as are willing to work at that rate. Unemployment may arise through friction or may be &quot;voluntary&quot;, in the sense that it arises from a refusal to accept employment owing to &quot;legislation or social practices ... or mere human obstinacy&quot;, but &quot;...the classical postulates do not admit of the possibility of the third category,&quot; which Keynes defines as &quot;involuntary unemployment&quot;.

Keynes raises two objections to the classical theory&#x27;s assumption that &quot;wage bargains ... determine the real wage&quot;. The first lies in the fact that &quot;labour stipulates (within limits) for a money-wage rather than a real wage&quot;. The second is that classical theory assumes that, &quot;The real wages of labour depend on the wage bargains which labour makes with the entrepreneurs,&quot; whereas, &quot;If money wages change, one would have expected the classical school to argue that prices would change in almost the same proportion, leaving the real wage and the level of unemployment practically the same as before.&quot; Keynes considers his second objection the more fundamental, but most commentators concentrate on his first one: it has been argued that the quantity theory of money protects the classical school from the conclusion Keynes expected from it.

===Keynesian unemployment===
====Saving and investment====
Saving is that part of income not devoted to consumption, and consumption is that part of expenditure not allocated to investment, i.e., to durable goods. Hence saving encompasses hoarding (the accumulation of income as cash) and the purchase of durable goods. The existence of net hoarding, or of a demand to hoard, is not admitted by the simplified liquidity preference model of the &quot;General Theory&quot;.

Once he rejects the classical theory that unemployment is due to excessive wages, Keynes proposes an alternative based on the relationship between saving and investment. In his view, unemployment arises whenever entrepreneurs&#x27; incentive to invest fails to keep pace with society&#x27;s propensity to save (&quot;propensity&quot; is one of Keynes&#x27;s synonyms for &quot;demand&quot;). The levels of saving and investment are necessarily equal, and income is therefore held down to a level where the desire to save is no greater than the incentive to invest.

The incentive to invest arises from the interplay between the physical circumstances of production and psychological anticipations of future profitability; but once these things are given the incentive is independent of income and depends solely on the rate of interest &quot;r&quot;. Keynes designates its value as a function of &quot;r&quot; as the &quot;schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital&quot;.

The propensity to save behaves quite differently. Saving is simply that part of income not devoted to consumption, and:
... the prevailing psychological law seems to be that when aggregate income increases, consumption expenditure will also increase but to a somewhat lesser extent.
Keynes adds that &quot;this psychological law was of the utmost importance in the development of my own thought&quot;.

====Liquidity preference====
Keynes viewed the money supply as one of the main determinants of the state of the real economy. The significance he attributed to it is one of the innovative features of his work, and was influential on the politically hostile monetarist school.

Money supply comes into play through the &quot;liquidity preference&quot; function, which is the demand function that corresponds to money supply. It specifies the amount of money people will seek to hold according to the state of the economy. In Keynes&#x27;s first (and simplest) account – that of Chapter 13 – liquidity preference is determined solely by the interest rates &quot;r&quot;—which is seen as the earnings forgone by holding wealth in liquid form: hence liquidity preference can be written &quot;L&quot;(&quot;r&quot; ) and in equilibrium must equal the externally fixed money supply &quot;M̂&quot;.

====Keynes&#x27;s economic model====
Money supply, saving and investment combine to determine the level of income as illustrated in the diagram, where the top graph shows money supply (on the vertical axis) against interest rate. &quot;M̂&quot; determines the ruling interest rate &quot;r̂&quot; through the liquidity preference function. The rate of interest determines the level of investment &quot;Î t&quot;hrough the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, shown as a blue curve in the lower graph. The red curves in the same diagram show what the propensities to save are for different incomes &quot;Y&quot; ; and the income &quot;Ŷ&quot; corresponding to the equilibrium state of the economy must be the one for which the implied level of saving at the established interest rate is equal to &quot;Î&quot;.

In Keynes&#x27;s more complicated liquidity preference theory (presented in Chapter 15) the demand for money depends on income as well as on the interest rate and the analysis becomes more complicated. Keynes never fully integrated his second liquidity preference doctrine with the rest of his theory, leaving that to John Hicks: see the IS-LM model below.

====Wage rigidity====
Keynes rejects the classical explanation of unemployment based on wage rigidity, but it is not clear what effect the wage rate has on unemployment in his system. He treats wages of all workers as proportional to a single rate set by collective bargaining, and chooses his units so that this rate never appears separately in his discussion. It is present implicitly in those quantities he expresses in wage units, while being absent from those he expresses in money terms. It is therefore difficult to see whether, and in what way, his results differ for a different wage rate, nor is it clear what he thought about the matter.

===Remedies for unemployment===
====Monetary remedies====
An increase in the money supply, according to Keynes&#x27;s theory, leads to a drop in the interest rate and an increase in the amount of investment that can be undertaken profitably, bringing with it an increase in total income.

====Fiscal remedies====
Keynes&#x27; name is associated with fiscal, rather than monetary, measures but they receive only passing (and often satirical) reference in the &quot;General Theory&quot;. He mentions &quot;increased public works&quot; as an example of something that brings employment through the &quot;multiplier&quot;, but this is before he develops the relevant theory, and he does not follow up when he gets to the theory.

Later in the same chapter he tells us that:
Ancient Egypt was doubly fortunate, and doubtless owed to this its fabled wealth, in that it possessed two activities, namely, pyramid-building as well as the search for the precious metals, the fruits of which, since they could not serve the needs of man by being consumed, did not stale with abundance. The Middle Ages built cathedrals and sang dirges. Two pyramids, two masses for the dead, are twice as good as one; but not so two railways from London to York.
But again, he does not get back to his implied recommendation to engage in public works, even if not fully justified from their direct benefits, when he constructs the theory. On the contrary he later advises us that ...
... our final task might be to select those variables which can be deliberately controlled or managed by central authority in the kind of system in which we actually live ...
and this appears to look forward to a future publication rather than to a subsequent chapter of the &quot;General Theory&quot;.

==Keynesian models and concepts==
===Aggregate demand===
Keynes&#x27; view of saving and investment was his most important departure from the classical outlook. It can be illustrated using the &quot;Keynesian cross&quot; devised by Paul Samuelson. The horizontal axis denotes total income and the purple curve shows &quot;C&quot; (&quot;Y&quot; ), the propensity to consume, whose complement &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Y&quot; ) is the propensity to save: the sum of these two functions is equal to total income, which is shown by the broken line at 45°.

The horizontal blue line &quot;I&quot; (&quot;r&quot; ) is the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital whose value is independent of &quot;Y&quot;. The schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital is dependent on the interest rate, specifically the interest rate cost of a new investment. If the interest rate charged by the financial sector to the productive sector is below the marginal efficiency of capital at that level of technology and capital intensity then investment is positive and grows the lower the interest rate is, given the diminishing return of capital. If the interest rate is above the marginal efficiency of capital then investment is equal to zero. Keynes interprets this as the demand for investment and denotes the sum of demands for consumption and investment as &quot;aggregate demand&quot;, plotted as a separate curve. Aggregate demand must equal total income, so equilibrium income must be determined by the point where the aggregate demand curve crosses the 45° line. This is the same horizontal position as the intersection of &quot;I&quot; (&quot;r&quot; ) with &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Y&quot; ).

The equation &quot;I&quot; (&quot;r&quot; ) = &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Y&quot; ) had been accepted by the classics, who had viewed it as the condition of equilibrium between supply and demand for investment funds and as determining the interest rate (see the classical theory of interest). But insofar as they had had a concept of aggregate demand, they had seen the demand for investment as being given by &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Y&quot; ), since for them saving was simply the indirect purchase of capital goods, with the result that aggregate demand was equal to total income as an identity rather than as an equilibrium condition. Keynes takes note of this view in Chapter 2, where he finds it present in the early writings of Alfred Marshall but adds that &quot;the doctrine is never stated to-day in this crude form&quot;.

The equation &quot;I&quot; (&quot;r&quot; ) = &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Y&quot; ) is accepted by Keynes for some or all of the following reasons:
* As a consequence of the &quot;principle of effective demand&quot;, which asserts that aggregate demand must equal total income (Chapter 3).
* As a consequence of the identity of saving with investment (Chapter 6) together with the equilibrium assumption that these quantities are equal to their demands.
* In agreement with the substance of the classical theory of the investment funds market, whose conclusion he considers the classics to have misinterpreted through circular reasoning (Chapter 14).

===The Keynesian multiplier===
Keynes introduces his discussion of the multiplier in Chapter 10 with a reference to Kahn&#x27;s earlier paper (see below). He designates Kahn&#x27;s multiplier the &quot;employment multiplier&quot; in distinction to his own &quot;investment multiplier&quot; and says that the two are only &quot;a little different&quot;. Kahn&#x27;s multiplier has consequently been understood by much of the Keynesian literature as playing a major role in Keynes&#x27;s own theory, an interpretation encouraged by the difficulty of understanding Keynes&#x27;s presentation. Kahn&#x27;s multiplier gives the title (&quot;The multiplier model&quot;) to the account of Keynesian theory in Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Economics&quot; and is almost as prominent in Alvin Hansen&#x27;s &quot;Guide to Keynes&quot; and in Joan Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Employment&quot;.

Keynes states that there is ...
... a confusion between the logical theory of the multiplier, which holds good continuously, without time-lag ... and the consequence of an expansion in the capital goods industries which take gradual effect, subject to a time-lag, and only after an interval ...
and implies that he is adopting the former theory. And when the multiplier eventually emerges as a component of Keynes&#x27;s theory (in Chapter 18) it turns out to be simply a measure of the change of one variable in response to a change in another. The schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital is identified as one of the independent variables of the economic system: &quot;What [it] tells us, is ... the point to which the output of new investment will be pushed ...&quot; The multiplier then gives &quot;the ratio ... between an increment of investment and the corresponding increment of aggregate income&quot;.

G. L. S. Shackle regarded Keynes&#x27; move away from Kahn&#x27;s multiplier as ...
... a retrograde step ... For when we look upon the Multiplier as an instantaneous functional relation ... we are merely using the word Multiplier to stand for an alternative way of looking at the marginal propensity to consume ...,
which G. M. Ambrosi cites as an instance of &quot;a Keynesian commentator who would have liked Keynes to have written something less &#x27;retrograde.

The value Keynes assigns to his multiplier is the reciprocal of the marginal propensity to save: &quot;k&quot;  = 1 / &quot;S&quot; &#x27;(&quot;Y&quot; ). This is the same as the formula for Kahn&#x27;s multiplier in a closed economy assuming that all saving (including the purchase of durable goods), and not just hoarding, constitutes leakage. Keynes gave his formula almost the status of a definition (it is put forward in advance of any explanation). His multiplier is indeed the value of &quot;the ratio ... between an increment of investment and the corresponding increment of aggregate income&quot; as Keynes derived it from his Chapter 13 model of liquidity preference, which implies that income must bear the entire effect of a change in investment. But under his Chapter 15 model a change in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital has an effect shared between the interest rate and income in proportions depending on the partial derivatives of the liquidity preference function. Keynes did not investigate the question of whether his formula for multiplier needed revision.

===The liquidity trap===
The liquidity trap is a phenomenon that may impede the effectiveness of monetary policies in reducing unemployment.

Economists generally think the rate of interest will not fall below a certain limit, often seen as zero or a slightly negative number. Keynes suggested that the limit might be appreciably greater than zero but did not attach much practical significance to it. The term &quot;liquidity trap&quot; was coined by Dennis Robertson in his comments on the &quot;General Theory&quot;, but it was John Hicks in &quot;Mr. Keynes and the Classics&quot; who recognised the significance of a slightly different concept.

If the economy is in a position such that the liquidity preference curve is almost vertical, as must happen as the lower limit on &quot;r&quot; is approached, then a change in the money supply &quot;M̂&quot; makes almost no difference to the equilibrium rate of interest &quot;r̂&quot; or, unless there is compensating steepness in the other curves, to the resulting income &quot;Ŷ&quot;. As Hicks put it, &quot;Monetary means will not force down the rate of interest any further.&quot;

Paul Krugman has worked extensively on the liquidity trap, claiming that it was the problem confronting the Japanese economy around the turn of the millennium. In his later words:
Short-term interest rates were close to zero, long-term rates were at historical lows, yet private investment spending remained insufficient to bring the economy out of deflation. In that environment, monetary policy was just as ineffective as Keynes described. Attempts by the Bank of Japan to increase the money supply simply added to already ample bank reserves and public holdings of cash...

====The IS–LM model====
Hicks showed how to analyse Keynes&#x27; system when liquidity preference is a function of income as well as of the rate of interest. Keynes&#x27;s admission of income as an influence on the demand for money is a step back in the direction of classical theory, and Hicks takes a further step in the same direction by generalizing the propensity to save to take both &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;r&quot; as arguments. Less classically he extends this generalization to the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital.

The IS-LM model uses two equations to express Keynes&#x27; model. The first, now written &quot;I&quot; (&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;r&quot; ) = &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;r&quot; ), expresses the principle of effective demand. We may construct a graph on (&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;r&quot; ) coordinates and draw a line connecting those points satisfying the equation: this is the &quot;IS&quot; curve. In the same way we can write the equation of equilibrium between liquidity preference and the money supply as &quot;L&quot;(&quot;Y&quot; ,&quot;r&quot; ) = &quot;M̂&quot; and draw a second curve – the &quot;LM&quot; curve – connecting points that satisfy it. The equilibrium values &quot;Ŷ&quot; of total income and &quot;r̂&quot; of interest rate are then given by the point of intersection of the two curves.

If we follow Keynes&#x27;s initial account under which liquidity preference depends only on the interest rate &quot;r&quot;, then the &quot;LM&quot; curve is horizontal.

Joan Robinson commented that:
... modern teaching has been confused by J. R. Hicks&#x27; attempt to reduce the &quot;General Theory&quot; to a version of static equilibrium with the formula IS–LM. Hicks has now repented and changed his name from J. R. to John, but it will take a long time for the effects of his teaching to wear off.

Hicks subsequently relapsed.

== Keynesian economic policies ==
=== Active fiscal policy ===
Keynes argued that the solution to the Great Depression was to stimulate the country (&quot;incentive to invest&quot;) through some combination of two approaches:

# A reduction in interest rates (monetary policy), and
# Government investment in infrastructure (fiscal policy).

If the interest rate at which businesses and consumers can borrow decreases, investments that were previously uneconomic become profitable, and large consumer sales normally financed through debt (such as houses, automobiles, and, historically, even appliances like refrigerators) become more affordable. A principal function of central banks in countries that have them is to influence this interest rate through a variety of mechanisms collectively called &quot;monetary policy&quot;. This is how monetary policy that reduces interest rates is thought to stimulate economic activity, i.e., &quot;grow the economy&quot;—and why it is called &quot;expansionary&quot; monetary policy.

Expansionary fiscal policy consists of increasing net public spending, which the government can effect by a) taxing less, b) spending more, or c) both. Investment and consumption by government raises demand for businesses&#x27; products and for employment, reversing the effects of the aforementioned imbalance. If desired spending exceeds revenue, the government finances the difference by borrowing from capital markets by issuing government bonds. This is called deficit spending. Two points are important to note at this point. First, deficits are not required for expansionary fiscal policy, and second, it is only &quot;change&quot; in net spending that can stimulate or depress the economy. For example, if a government ran a deficit of 10% both last year and this year, this would represent neutral fiscal policy. In fact, if it ran a deficit of 10% last year and 5% this year, this would actually be contractionary. On the other hand, if the government ran a surplus of 10% of GDP last year and 5% this year, that would be expansionary fiscal policy, despite never running a deficit at all.

But – contrary to some critical characterizations of it – Keynesianism does not consist solely of deficit spending, since it recommends adjusting fiscal policies according to cyclical circumstances. An example of a counter-cyclical policy is raising taxes to cool the economy and to prevent inflation when there is abundant demand-side growth, and engaging in deficit spending on labour-intensive infrastructure projects to stimulate employment and stabilize wages during economic downturns.

Keynes&#x27;s ideas influenced Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s view that insufficient buying-power caused the Depression. During his presidency, Roosevelt adopted some aspects of Keynesian economics, especially after 1937, when, in the depths of the Depression, the United States suffered from recession yet again following fiscal contraction. But to many the true success of Keynesian policy can be seen at the onset of World War II, which provided a kick to the world economy, removed uncertainty, and forced the rebuilding of destroyed capital. Keynesian ideas became almost official in social-democratic Europe after the war and in the U.S. in the 1960s.

The Keynesian advocacy of deficit spending contrasted with the classical and neoclassical economic analysis of fiscal policy. They admitted that fiscal stimulus could actuate production. But, to these schools, there was no reason to believe that this stimulation would outrun the side-effects that &quot;crowd out&quot; private investment: first, it would increase the demand for labour and raise wages, hurting profitability; Second, a government deficit increases the stock of government bonds, reducing their market price and encouraging high interest rates, making it more expensive for business to finance fixed investment. Thus, efforts to stimulate the economy would be self-defeating.

The Keynesian response is that such fiscal policy is appropriate only when unemployment is persistently high, above the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). In that case, crowding out is minimal. Further, private investment can be &quot;crowded in&quot;: Fiscal stimulus raises the market for business output, raising cash flow and profitability, spurring business optimism. To Keynes, this accelerator effect meant that government and business could be &quot;complements&quot; rather than substitutes in this situation.

Second, as the stimulus occurs, gross domestic product rises—raising the amount of saving, helping to finance the increase in fixed investment. Finally, government outlays need not always be wasteful: government investment in public goods that is not provided by profit-seekers encourages the private sector&#x27;s growth. That is, government spending on such things as basic research, public health, education, and infrastructure could help the long-term growth of &quot;potential output&quot;.

In Keynes&#x27;s theory, there must be significant slack in the labour market before fiscal expansion is justified.

Keynesian economists believe that adding to profits and incomes during boom cycles through tax cuts, and removing income and profits from the economy through cuts in spending during downturns, tends to exacerbate the negative effects of the business cycle. This effect is especially pronounced when the government controls a large fraction of the economy, as increased tax revenue may aid investment in state enterprises in downturns, and decreased state revenue and investment harm those enterprises.

===Views on trade imbalance===

In the last few years of his life, John Maynard Keynes was much preoccupied with the question of balance in international trade. He was the leader of the British delegation to the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in 1944 that established the Bretton Woods system of international currency management.
He was the principal author of a proposal – the so-called Keynes Plan – for an International Clearing Union. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by &#x27;creating&#x27; additional &#x27;international money&#x27;, and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because &quot;American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships&quot;.

The new system is not founded on free trade (liberalization of foreign trade) but rather on regulating international trade to eliminate trade imbalances. Nations with a surplus would have a powerful incentive to get rid of it, which would automatically clear other nations&#x27; deficits. Keynes proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency—the &quot;bancor&quot;—which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country&#x27;s trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a &quot;negative externality&quot; on trading partners, and posed far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity. Keynes thought that surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances.
In &quot;&quot;National Self-Sufficiency&quot; The Yale Review, Vol. 22, no. 4 (June 1933)&quot;, he already highlighted the problems created by free trade.

His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, then editor of The Economist, &quot;If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.&quot;

These ideas were informed by events prior to the Great Depression when – in the opinion of Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.

Influenced by Keynes, economic texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, &quot;An Outline of Money&quot;, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the &#x27;problem of balance&#x27;. However, in more recent years, since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilizing effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes&#x27; insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.

===Views on free trade and protectionism===
====The turning point of the Great Depression====
At the beginning of his career, Keynes was an economist close to Alfred Marshall, deeply convinced of the benefits of free trade. From the crisis of 1929 onwards, noting the commitment of the British authorities to defend the gold parity of the pound sterling and the rigidity of nominal wages, he gradually adhered to protectionist measures.

On 5 November 1929, when heard by the Macmillan Committee to bring the British economy out of the crisis, Keynes indicated that the introduction of tariffs on imports would help to rebalance the trade balance. The committee&#x27;s report states in a section entitled &quot;import control and export aid&quot;, that in an economy where there is not full employment, the introduction of tariffs can improve production and employment. Thus the reduction of the trade deficit favours the country&#x27;s growth.

In January 1930, in the Economic Advisory Council, Keynes proposed the introduction of a system of protection to reduce imports. In the autumn of 1930, he proposed a uniform tariff of 10% on all imports and subsidies of the same rate for all exports. In the &quot;Treatise on Money&quot;, published in the autumn of 1930, he took up the idea of tariffs or other trade restrictions with the aim of reducing the volume of imports and rebalancing the balance of trade.

On 7 March 1931, in the &quot;New Statesman and Nation&quot;, he wrote an article entitled &quot;Proposal for a Tariff Revenue&quot;. He pointed out that the reduction of wages led to a reduction in national demand which constrained markets. Instead, he proposes the idea of an expansionary policy combined with a tariff system to neutralize the effects on the balance of trade. The application of customs tariffs seemed to him &quot;unavoidable, whoever the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be&quot;. Thus, for Keynes, an economic recovery policy is only fully effective if the trade deficit is eliminated. He proposed a 15% tax on manufactured and semi-manufactured goods and 5% on certain foodstuffs and raw materials, with others needed for exports exempted (wool, cotton).

In 1932, in an article entitled &quot;The Pro- and Anti-Tariffs&quot;, published in &quot;The Listener&quot;, he envisaged the protection of farmers and certain sectors such as the automobile and iron and steel industries, considering them indispensable to Britain.

====The critique of the theory of comparative advantage====
In the post-crisis situation of 1929, Keynes judged the assumptions of the free trade model unrealistic. He criticized, for example, the neoclassical assumption of wage adjustment.

As early as 1930, in a note to the Economic Advisory Council, he doubted the intensity of the gain from specialization in the case of manufactured goods. While participating in the MacMillan Committee, he admitted that he no longer &quot;believed in a very high degree of national specialisation&quot; and refused to &quot;abandon any industry which is unable, for the moment, to survive&quot;. He also criticized the static dimension of the theory of comparative advantage, which, in his view, by fixing comparative advantages definitively, led in practice to a waste of national resources.

In the Daily Mail of 13 March 1931, he called the assumption of perfect sectoral labour mobility &quot;nonsense&quot; since it states that a person made unemployed contributes to a reduction in the wage rate until he finds a job. But for Keynes, this change of job may involve costs (job search, training) and is not always possible. Generally speaking, for Keynes, the assumptions of full employment and automatic return to equilibrium discredit the theory of comparative advantage.

In July 1933, he published an article in the &quot;New Statesman and Nation&quot; entitled &quot;National Self-Sufficiency&quot;, in which he criticized the argument of the specialization of economies, which is the basis of free trade. He thus proposed the search for a certain degree of self-sufficiency. Instead of the specialization of economies advocated by the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage, he prefers the maintenance of a diversity of activities for nations. In it he refutes the principle of peacemaking trade. His vision of trade became that of a system where foreign capitalists compete for new markets. He defends the idea of producing on national soil when possible and reasonable and expresses sympathy for the advocates of protectionism. 
He notes in &quot;National Self-Sufficiency&quot;:
He also writes in &quot;National Self-Sufficiency&quot;:

Later, Keynes had a written correspondence with James Meade centred on the issue of import restrictions. Keynes and Meade discussed the best choice between quota and tariff. In March 1944 Keynes began a discussion with Marcus Fleming after the latter had written an article entitled &quot;Quotas versus depreciation&quot;. On this occasion, we see that he has definitely taken a protectionist stance after the Great Depression. He considered that quotas could be more effective than currency depreciation in dealing with external imbalances. Thus, for Keynes, currency depreciation was no longer sufficient, and protectionist measures became necessary to avoid trade deficits. To avoid the return of crises due to a self-regulating economic system, it seemed essential to him to regulate trade and stop free trade (deregulation of foreign trade).

He points out that countries that import more than they export weaken their economies. When the trade deficit increases, unemployment rises and GDP slows down. And surplus countries exert a &quot;negative externality&quot; on their trading partners. They get richer at the expense of others and destroy the output of their trading partners. John Maynard Keynes believed that the products of surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances. Thus he no longer believes in the theory of comparative advantage (on which free trade is based) which states that the trade deficit does not matter, since trade is mutually beneficial.
This also explains his desire to replace the liberalization of international trade (Free Trade) with a regulatory system aimed at eliminating trade imbalances in his proposals for the Bretton Woods Agreement.

== Postwar Keynesianism ==

Keynes&#x27;s ideas became widely accepted after World War II, and until the early 1970s, Keynesian economics provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. Governments prepared high quality economic statistics on an ongoing basis and tried to base their policies on the Keynesian theory that had become the norm. In the early era of social liberalism and social democracy, most western capitalist countries enjoyed low, stable unemployment and modest inflation, an era called the Golden Age of Capitalism.

In terms of policy, the twin tools of post-war Keynesian economics were fiscal policy and monetary policy. While these are credited to Keynes, others, such as economic historian David Colander, argue that they are, rather, due to the interpretation of Keynes by Abba Lerner in his theory of functional finance, and should instead be called &quot;Lernerian&quot; rather than &quot;Keynesian&quot;.

Through the 1950s, moderate degrees of government demand leading industrial development, and use of fiscal and monetary counter-cyclical policies continued, and reached a peak in the &quot;go go&quot; 1960s, where it seemed to many Keynesians that prosperity was now permanent. In 1971, Republican US President Richard Nixon even proclaimed &quot;I am now a Keynesian in economics.&quot;

Beginning in the late 1960s, a new classical macroeconomics movement arose, critical of Keynesian assumptions (see sticky prices), and seemed, especially in the 1970s, to explain certain phenomena better. It was characterized by explicit and rigorous adherence to microfoundations, as well as use of increasingly sophisticated mathematical modelling.

With the oil shock of 1973, and the economic problems of the 1970s, Keynesian economics began to fall out of favour. During this time, many economies experienced high and rising unemployment, coupled with high and rising inflation, contradicting the Phillips curve&#x27;s prediction. This stagflation meant that the simultaneous application of expansionary (anti-recession) and contractionary (anti-inflation) policies appeared necessary. This dilemma led to the end of the Keynesian near-consensus of the 1960s, and the rise throughout the 1970s of ideas based upon more classical analysis, including monetarism, supply-side economics, and new classical economics.

However, by the late 1980s, certain failures of the new classical models, both theoretical (see Real business cycle theory) and empirical (see the &quot;Volcker recession&quot;) hastened the emergence of New Keynesian economics, a school that sought to unite the most realistic aspects of Keynesian and neo-classical assumptions and place them on more rigorous theoretical foundation than ever before.

One line of thinking, utilized also as a critique of the notably high unemployment and potentially disappointing GNP growth rates associated with the new classical models by the mid-1980s, was to emphasize low unemployment and maximal economic growth at the cost of somewhat higher inflation (its consequences kept in check by indexing and other methods, and its overall rate kept lower and steadier by such potential policies as Martin Weitzman&#x27;s share economy).

===Schools===
Multiple schools of economic thought that trace their legacy to Keynes currently exist, the notable ones being neo-Keynesian economics, New Keynesian economics, post-Keynesian economics, and the new neoclassical synthesis. Keynes&#x27;s biographer Robert Skidelsky writes that the post-Keynesian school has remained closest to the spirit of Keynes&#x27;s work in following his monetary theory and rejecting the neutrality of money. Today these ideas, regardless of provenance, are referred to in academia under the rubric of &quot;Keynesian economics&quot;, due to Keynes&#x27;s role in consolidating, elaborating, and popularizing them.

In the postwar era, Keynesian analysis was combined with neoclassical economics to produce what is generally termed the &quot;neoclassical synthesis&quot;, yielding neo-Keynesian economics, which dominated mainstream macroeconomic thought. Though it was widely held that there was no strong automatic tendency to full employment, many believed that if government policy were used to ensure it, the economy would behave as neoclassical theory predicted. This post-war domination by neo-Keynesian economics was broken during the stagflation of the 1970s. There was a lack of consensus among macroeconomists in the 1980s, and during this period New Keynesian economics was developed, ultimately becoming- along with new classical macroeconomics- a part of the current consensus, known as the new neoclassical synthesis.

Post-Keynesian economists, on the other hand, reject the neoclassical synthesis and, in general, neoclassical economics applied to the macroeconomy. Post-Keynesian economics is a heterodox school that holds that both neo-Keynesian economics and New Keynesian economics are incorrect, and a misinterpretation of Keynes&#x27;s ideas. The post-Keynesian school encompasses a variety of perspectives, but has been far less influential than the other more mainstream Keynesian schools.

Interpretations of Keynes have emphasized his stress on the international coordination of Keynesian policies, the need for international economic institutions, and the ways in which economic forces could lead to war or could promote peace.

===Keynesianism and liberalism===
In a 2014 paper, economist Alan Blinder argues that, &quot;for not very good reasons&quot;, public opinion in the United States has associated Keynesianism with liberalism, and he states that such is incorrect. For example, both Presidents Ronald Reagan (1981–89) and George W. Bush (2001–09) supported policies that were, in fact, Keynesian, even though both men were conservative leaders. And tax cuts can provide highly helpful fiscal stimulus during a recession, just as much as infrastructure spending can. Blinder concludes: &quot;If you are not teaching your students that &#x27;Keynesianism&#x27; is neither conservative nor liberal, you should be.&quot;

==Other schools of economic thought==
The Keynesian schools of economics are situated alongside a number of other schools that have the same perspectives on what the economic issues are, but differ on what causes them and how best to resolve them. Today, most of these schools of thought have been subsumed into modern macroeconomic theory.

===Stockholm School===

The Stockholm school rose to prominence at about the same time that Keynes published his General Theory and shared a common concern in business cycles and unemployment. The second generation of Swedish economists also advocated government intervention through spending during economic downturns although opinions are divided over whether they conceived the essence of Keynes&#x27;s theory before he did.

===Monetarism===

There was debate between monetarists and Keynesians in the 1960s over the role of government in stabilizing the economy. Both monetarists and Keynesians agree that issues such as business cycles, unemployment, and deflation are caused by inadequate demand. However, they had fundamentally different perspectives on the capacity of the economy to find its own equilibrium, and the degree of government intervention that would be appropriate. Keynesians emphasized the use of discretionary fiscal policy and monetary policy, while monetarists argued the primacy of monetary policy, and that it should be rules-based.

The debate was largely resolved in the 1980s. Since then, economists have largely agreed that central banks should bear the primary responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and that monetary policy should largely follow the Taylor rule – which many economists credit with the Great Moderation. The financial crisis of 2007–08, however, has convinced many economists and governments of the need for fiscal interventions and highlighted the difficulty in stimulating economies through monetary policy alone during a liquidity trap.

===Marxism and Public choice===
Some Marxist economists criticized Keynesian economics. For example, in his 1946 appraisal Paul Sweezy—while admitting that there was much in the &quot;General Theory&quot;&#x27;s analysis of effective demand that Marxists could draw on—described Keynes as a prisoner of his neoclassical upbringing. Sweezy argued that Keynes had never been able to view the capitalist system as a totality. He argued that Keynes regarded the class struggle carelessly, and overlooked the class role of the capitalist state, which he treated as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, and some other points. While Michał Kalecki was generally enthusiastic about the Keynesian Revolution, he predicted that it would not endure, in his article &quot;Political Aspects of Full Employment&quot;. In the article Kalecki predicted that the full employment delivered by Keynesian policy would eventually lead to a more assertive working class and weakening of the social position of business leaders, causing the elite to use their political power to force the displacement of the Keynesian policy even though profits would be higher than under a laissez faire system: The elites would not care about risking the higher profits in the pursuit of reclaiming prestige in the society and the political power.

James M. Buchanan criticized Keynesian economics on the grounds that governments would in practice be unlikely to implement theoretically optimal policies. The implicit assumption underlying the Keynesian fiscal revolution, according to Buchanan, was that economic policy would be made by wise men, acting without regard to political pressures or opportunities, and guided by disinterested economic technocrats. He argued that this was an unrealistic assumption about political, bureaucratic and electoral behaviour. Buchanan blamed Keynesian economics for what he considered a decline in America&#x27;s fiscal discipline. Buchanan argued that deficit spending would evolve into a permanent disconnect between spending and revenue, precisely because it brings short-term gains, so, ending up institutionalizing irresponsibility in the federal government, the largest and most central institution in our society.

Martin Feldstein argues that the legacy of Keynesian economics–the misdiagnosis of unemployment, the fear of saving, and the unjustified government intervention–affected the fundamental ideas of policy makers.
Milton Friedman thought that Keynes&#x27;s political bequest was harmful for two reasons. First, he thought whatever the economic analysis, benevolent dictatorship is likely sooner or later to lead to a totalitarian society. Second, he thought Keynes&#x27;s economic theories appealed to a group far broader than economists primarily because of their link to his political approach.
Alex Tabarrok argues that Keynesian politics–as distinct from Keynesian policies–has failed pretty much whenever it&#x27;s been tried, at least in liberal democracies.

In response to this argument, John Quiggin, wrote about these theories&#x27; implication for a liberal democratic order. He thought that if it is generally accepted that democratic politics is nothing more than a battleground for competing interest groups, then reality will come to resemble the model.
Paul Krugman wrote &quot;I don&#x27;t think we need to take that as an immutable fact of life; but still, what are the alternatives?&quot;
Daniel Kuehn, criticized James M. Buchanan. He argued, &quot;if you have a problem with politicians – criticize politicians,&quot; not Keynes. He also argued that empirical evidence makes it pretty clear that Buchanan was wrong.
James Tobin argued, if advising government officials, politicians, voters, it&#x27;s not for economists to play games with them.
Keynes implicitly rejected this argument, in &quot;soon or late it is ideas not vested interests which are dangerous for good or evil.&quot;

Brad DeLong has argued that politics is the main motivator behind objections to the view that government should try to serve a stabilizing macroeconomic role. Paul Krugman argued that a regime that by and large lets markets work, but in which the government is ready both to rein in excesses and fight slumps is inherently unstable, due to intellectual instability, political instability, and financial instability.

===New classical===
Another influential school of thought was based on the Lucas critique of Keynesian economics. This called for greater consistency with microeconomic theory based on rational choice theory, and in particular emphasized the idea of rational expectations. Lucas and others argued that Keynesian economics required remarkably foolish and short-sighted behaviour from people, which totally contradicted the economic understanding of their behaviour at a micro level. New classical economics introduced a set of macroeconomic theories that were based on optimizing microeconomic behaviour. These models have been developed into the real business-cycle theory, which argues that business cycle fluctuations can to a large extent be accounted for by real (in contrast to nominal) shocks.

Beginning in the late 1950s new classical macroeconomists began to disagree with the methodology employed by Keynes and his successors. Keynesians emphasized the dependence of consumption on disposable income and, also, of investment on current profits and current cash flow. In addition, Keynesians posited a Phillips curve that tied nominal wage inflation to unemployment rate. To support these theories, Keynesians typically traced the logical foundations of their model (using introspection) and supported their assumptions with statistical evidence. New classical theorists demanded that macroeconomics be grounded on the same foundations as microeconomic theory, profit-maximizing firms and rational, utility-maximizing consumers.

The result of this shift in methodology produced several important divergences from Keynesian macroeconomics:
# Independence of consumption and current income (life-cycle permanent income hypothesis)
# Irrelevance of current profits to investment (Modigliani–Miller theorem)
# Long run independence of inflation and unemployment (natural rate of unemployment)
# The inability of monetary policy to stabilize output (rational expectations)
# Irrelevance of taxes and budget deficits to consumption (Ricardian equivalence)

=== Austrian school ===
F.A. Hayek, an Austrian-style economist described Keynesianism as a system of &quot;economics of abundance&quot; stating it is, &quot;a system of economics which is based on the assumption that no real scarcity exists, and that the only scarcity with which we need concern ourselves is the artificial scarcity created by the determination of people not to sell their services and products below certain arbitrarily fixed prices.&quot; Ludwig von Mises, another Austrian economist, describes a Keynesian system as believing it can solve most problems with &quot;more money and credit&quot; which leads to a system of &quot;inflationism&quot; in which &quot;prices (of goods) rise higher and higher.&quot; Murray Rothbard wrote that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of money and credit created a &quot;dismal monetary and banking situation,&quot; since it allows for the central bankers that have the exclusive ability to print money to be &quot;unchecked and out of control.&quot; Rothbard went on to say in an interview that, &quot;There is one good thing about (Karl) Marx: he was not a Keynesian.&quot;

=== Others ===
The social historian C. J. Coventry argues in &quot;Keynes from Below: A Social History of Second World War Keynesian Economics&quot; (2023) that Keynes and Keynesian economics was unpopular in the United Kingdom and Australia in the 1940s. Many workers and trades unions, as well as figures in the British Labour Party and Australian Labor Party, saw Keynesianism as a means of stopping socialism. Keynes was largely supported by business leaders, bankers and conservative parties, or tripartite third way Catholics eager to avoid socialism after the Second World War. While Coventry agrees that the Keynesianism has considerable benefits, he argues that these benefits arose from the next phase of capitalism with many of the disadvantages being forced onto peoples in the third world, such as in British Malaya where there was bloodshed for crucial resources.

<text>In physics, the kinetic energy of an object is the form of energy that it possesses due to its motion.

In classical mechanics, the kinetic energy of a non-rotating object of mass &quot;m&quot; traveling at a speed &quot;v&quot; is formula_1. 

The kinetic energy of an object is equal to the work, or force (F) in the direction of motion times its displacement (s), needed to accelerate the object from rest to its given speed. The same amount of work is done by the object when decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest.

The SI unit of energy is the joule, while the English unit of energy is the foot-pound.

In relativistic mechanics, formula_1 is a good approximation of kinetic energy only when &quot;v&quot; is much less than the speed of light.

==History and etymology==
The adjective &quot;kinetic&quot; has its roots in the Greek word κίνησις &quot;kinesis&quot;, meaning &quot;motion&quot;. The dichotomy between kinetic energy and potential energy can be traced back to Aristotle&#x27;s concepts of actuality and potentiality. 

The principle of classical mechanics that &quot;E&quot; ∝ &quot;mv&quot;2 is conserved was first developed by Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Bernoulli, who described kinetic energy as the &quot;living force&quot; or &quot;vis viva&quot;. Willem &#x27;s Gravesande of the Netherlands provided experimental evidence of this relationship in 1722. By dropping weights from different heights into a block of clay, Gravesande determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed. Émilie du Châtelet recognized the implications of the experiment and published an explanation.

The terms &quot;kinetic energy&quot; and &quot;work&quot; in their present scientific meanings date back to the mid-19th century. Early understandings of these ideas can be attributed to Thomas Young, who in his 1802 lecture to the Royal Society, was the first to use the term &quot;energy&quot; to refer to kinetic energy in its modern sense, instead of &quot;vis viva&quot;. Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis published in 1829 the paper titled &quot;Du Calcul de l&#x27;Effet des Machines&quot; outlining the mathematics of kinetic energy. William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, is given the credit for coining the term &quot;kinetic energy&quot; c. 1849–1851. William Rankine, who had introduced the term &quot;potential energy&quot; in 1853, and the phrase &quot;actual energy&quot; to complement it, later cites William Thomson and Peter Tait as substituting the word &quot;kinetic&quot; for &quot;actual&quot;.

==Overview==
Energy occurs in many forms, including chemical energy, thermal energy, electromagnetic radiation, gravitational energy, electric energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, and rest energy. These can be categorized in two main classes: potential energy and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.

Kinetic energy may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy. For example, a cyclist transfers chemical energy provided by food to the bicycle and cyclist&#x27;s store of kinetic energy as they increase their speed. On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome air resistance and friction. The chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion, but the process is not completely efficient and produces thermal energy within the cyclist.

The kinetic energy in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be converted to other forms. For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top. The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling down the other side of the hill. Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it never regains all of its speed without additional pedaling. The energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction. Alternatively, the cyclist could connect a dynamo to one of the wheels and generate some electrical energy on the descent. The bicycle would be traveling slower at the bottom of the hill than without the generator because some of the energy has been diverted into electrical energy. Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as heat.

Like any physical quantity that is a function of velocity, the kinetic energy of an object depends on the relationship between the object and the observer&#x27;s frame of reference. Thus, the kinetic energy of an object is not invariant.

Spacecraft use chemical energy to launch and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach orbital velocity. In an entirely circular orbit, this kinetic energy remains constant because there is almost no friction in near-earth space. However, it becomes apparent at re-entry when some of the kinetic energy is converted to heat. If the orbit is elliptical or hyperbolic, then throughout the orbit kinetic and potential energy are exchanged; kinetic energy is greatest and potential energy lowest at closest approach to the earth or other massive body, while potential energy is greatest and kinetic energy the lowest at maximum distance. Disregarding loss or gain however, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy remains constant.

Kinetic energy can be passed from one object to another. In the game of billiards, the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick. If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically, and the ball it hit accelerates as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. Collisions in billiards are effectively elastic collisions, in which kinetic energy is preserved. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound and binding energy (breaking bound structures).

Flywheels have been developed as a method of energy storage. This illustrates that kinetic energy is also stored in rotational motion.

Several mathematical descriptions of kinetic energy exist that describe it in the appropriate physical situation. For objects and processes in common human experience, the formula mv2 given by classical mechanics is suitable. However, if the speed of the object is comparable to the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant and the relativistic formula is used. If the object is on the atomic or sub-atomic scale, quantum mechanical effects are significant, and a quantum mechanical model must be employed.

==Kinetic energy for non-relativistic velocity==
Treatments of kinetic energy depend upon the relative velocity of objects compared to the fixed speed of light. Speeds experienced directly by humans are non-relativisitic; higher speeds require the theory of relativity. 

===Kinetic energy of rigid bodies===
In classical mechanics, the kinetic energy of a &quot;point object&quot; (an object so small that its mass can be assumed to exist at one point), or a non-rotating rigid body depends on the mass of the body as well as its speed. The kinetic energy is equal to half the product of the mass and the square of the speed. In formula form:

formula_3

where formula_4 is the mass and formula_5 is the speed (magnitude of the velocity) of the body. In SI units, mass is measured in kilograms, speed in metres per second, and the resulting kinetic energy is in joules.

For example, one would calculate the kinetic energy of an 80 kg mass (about 180 lbs) traveling at 18 metres per second (about 40 mph, or 65 km/h) as

formula_6

When a person throws a ball, the person does work on it to give it speed as it leaves the hand. The moving ball can then hit something and push it, doing work on what it hits. The kinetic energy of a moving object is equal to the work required to bring it from rest to that speed, or the work the object can do while being brought to rest: net force × displacement = kinetic energy, i.e.,

formula_7

Since the kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed, an object doubling its speed has four times as much kinetic energy. For example, a car traveling twice as fast as another requires four times as much distance to stop, assuming a constant braking force. As a consequence of this quadrupling, it takes four times the work to double the speed.

The kinetic energy of an object is related to its momentum by the equation:
formula_8

where:
*formula_9 is momentum
*formula_4 is mass of the body

For the &quot;translational kinetic energy,&quot; that is the kinetic energy associated with rectilinear motion, of a rigid body with constant mass formula_4, whose center of mass is moving in a straight line with speed formula_5, as seen above is equal to

formula_13

where:
*formula_4 is the mass of the body
*formula_5 is the speed of the center of mass of the body.

The kinetic energy of any entity depends on the reference frame in which it is measured. However, the total energy of an isolated system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the reference frame in which it is measured. Thus, the chemical energy converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its exhaust stream depending upon the chosen reference frame. This is called the Oberth effect. But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of reference frame. Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.

The kinetic energy of such systems depends on the choice of reference frame: the reference frame that gives the minimum value of that energy is the center of momentum frame, i.e. the reference frame in which the total momentum of the system is zero. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the invariant mass of the system as a whole.

====Derivation====
=====Without vector calculus=====
The work W done by a force &quot;F&quot; on an object over a distance &quot;s&quot; parallel to &quot;F&quot; equals 

formula_16

Using Newton&#x27;s Second Law 

formula_17 

with &quot;m&quot; the mass and &quot;a&quot; the acceleration of the object and 

formula_18

the distance traveled by the accelerated object in time &quot;t&quot;, we find with formula_19 for the velocity &quot;v&quot; of the object

formula_20

=====With vector calculus=====
The work done in accelerating a particle with mass &quot;m&quot; during the infinitesimal time interval &quot;dt&quot; is given by the dot product of &quot;force&quot; F and the infinitesimal &quot;displacement&quot; &quot;d&quot;x

formula_21

where we have assumed the relationship p = &quot;m&quot; v and the validity of Newton&#x27;s Second Law. (However, also see the special relativistic derivation below.)

Applying the product rule we see that:

formula_22

Therefore (assuming constant mass so that &quot;dm&quot; = 0), we have

formula_23

Since this is a total differential (that is, it only depends on the final state, not how the particle got there), we can integrate it and call the result kinetic energy:

formula_24

This equation states that the kinetic energy (&quot;E&quot;k) is equal to the integral of the dot product of the momentum (p) of a body and the infinitesimal change of the velocity (v) of the body. It is assumed that the body starts with no kinetic energy when it is at rest (motionless).

===Rotating bodies===
If a rigid body Q is rotating about any line through the center of mass then it has &quot;rotational kinetic energy&quot; (formula_25) which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of its moving parts, and is thus given by:

formula_26

where:
* ω is the body&#x27;s angular velocity
* &quot;r&quot; is the distance of any mass &quot;dm&quot; from that line
* formula_27 is the body&#x27;s moment of inertia, equal to formula_28.

(In this equation the moment of inertia must be taken about an axis through the center of mass and the rotation measured by ω must be around that axis; more general equations exist for systems where the object is subject to wobble due to its eccentric shape).

===Kinetic energy of systems===
A system of bodies may have internal kinetic energy due to the relative motion of the bodies in the system. For example, in the Solar System the planets and planetoids are orbiting the Sun. In a tank of gas, the molecules are moving in all directions. The kinetic energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the bodies it contains.

A macroscopic body that is stationary (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body&#x27;s center of momentum) may have various kinds of internal energy at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and nuclear spin. These all contribute to the body&#x27;s mass, as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a macroscopic body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the macroscopic movement only. However, all internal energies of all types contribute to a body&#x27;s mass, inertia, and total energy.

===Fluid dynamics===
In fluid dynamics, the kinetic energy per unit volume at each point in an incompressible fluid flow field is called the dynamic pressure at that point.

formula_3

Dividing by V, the unit of volume:

formula_30

where formula_31 is the dynamic pressure, and ρ is the density of the incompressible fluid.

===Frame of reference===

The speed, and thus the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by choosing a suitable inertial frame of reference. For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary to an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy. By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial reference frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case, the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial reference frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system&#x27;s invariant mass, which is independent of the reference frame.

The total kinetic energy of a system depends on the inertial frame of reference: it is the sum of the total kinetic energy in a center of momentum frame and the kinetic energy the total mass would have if it were concentrated in the center of mass.

This may be simply shown: let formula_32 be the relative velocity of the center of mass frame &quot;i&quot; in the frame &quot;k&quot;. Since

formula_33

Then,

formula_34

However, let formula_35 the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame, formula_36 would be simply the total momentum that is by definition zero in the center of mass frame, and let the total mass: formula_37. Substituting, we get:

formula_38

Thus the kinetic energy of a system is lowest to center of momentum reference frames, i.e., frames of reference in which the center of mass is stationary (either the center of mass frame or any other center of momentum frame). In any different frame of reference, there is additional kinetic energy corresponding to the total mass moving at the speed of the center of mass. The kinetic energy of the system in the center of momentum frame is a quantity that is invariant (all observers see it to be the same).

===Rotation in systems===
It sometimes is convenient to split the total kinetic energy of a body into the sum of the body&#x27;s center-of-mass translational kinetic energy and the energy of rotation around the center of mass (rotational energy):

formula_39

where:
*&quot;E&quot;k is the total kinetic energy
*&quot;E&quot;t is the translational kinetic energy
*&quot;E&quot;r is the &quot;rotational energy&quot; or &quot;angular kinetic energy&quot; in the rest frame

Thus the kinetic energy of a tennis ball in flight is the kinetic energy due to its rotation, plus the kinetic energy due to its translation.

==Relativistic kinetic energy ==
If a body&#x27;s speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, it is necessary to use relativistic mechanics to calculate its kinetic energy. In relativity, the total energy is given by the energy-momentum relation:

formula_40

Here we use the relativistic expression for linear momentum: formula_41, where formula_42.
with formula_4 being an object&#x27;s (rest) mass, formula_5 speed, and &quot;c&quot; the speed of light in vacuum.
Then kinetic energy is the total relativistic energy minus the rest energy:
formula_45

At low speeds, the square root can be expanded and the rest energy drops out, giving the Newtonian kinetic energy. 

=== Derivation ===
Start with the expression for linear momentum formula_46, where formula_42.
Integrating by parts yields

formula_48

Since formula_49,

formula_50

formula_51 is a constant of integration for the indefinite integral.

Simplifying the expression we obtain

formula_52

formula_53 is found by observing that when formula_54 and formula_55, giving

formula_56

resulting in the formula

formula_57

This formula shows that the work expended accelerating an object from rest approaches infinity as the velocity approaches the speed of light. Thus it is impossible to accelerate an object across this boundary.

=== Low speed limit ===

The mathematical by-product of this calculation is the mass–energy equivalence formula, that mass and energy are essentially the same thing:

formula_58

At a low speed (&quot;v&quot; ≪ &quot;c&quot;), the relativistic kinetic energy is approximated well by the classical kinetic energy. To see this, apply the binomial approximation or take the first two terms of the Taylor expansion in powers of formula_59 for the reciprocal square root:

formula_60

So, the total energy formula_61 can be partitioned into the rest mass energy plus the non-relativistic kinetic energy at low speeds.

When objects move at a speed much slower than light (e.g. in everyday phenomena on Earth), the first two terms of the series predominate. The next term in the Taylor series approximation

formula_62

is small for low speeds. For example, for a speed of the correction to the non-relativistic kinetic energy is 0.0417 J/kg (on a non-relativistic kinetic energy of 50 MJ/kg) and for a speed of 100 km/s it is 417 J/kg (on a non-relativistic kinetic energy of 5 GJ/kg).

The relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum is given by

formula_63

This can also be expanded as a Taylor series, the first term of which is the simple expression from Newtonian mechanics:
:formula_64

This suggests that the formulae for energy and momentum are not special and axiomatic, but concepts emerging from the equivalence of mass and energy and the principles of relativity.

===General relativity===

Using the convention that

formula_65

where the four-velocity of a particle is

formula_66

and formula_67 is the proper time of the particle, there is also an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle in general relativity.

If the particle has momentum

formula_68

as it passes by an observer with four-velocity &quot;u&quot;obs, then the expression for total energy of the particle as observed (measured in a local inertial frame) is

formula_69

and the kinetic energy can be expressed as the total energy minus the rest energy:

formula_70

Consider the case of a metric that is diagonal and spatially isotropic (&quot;g&quot;&quot;tt&quot;, &quot;g&quot;&quot;ss&quot;, &quot;g&quot;&quot;ss&quot;, &quot;g&quot;&quot;ss&quot;). Since

formula_71

where &quot;v&quot;α is the ordinary velocity measured w.r.t. the coordinate system, we get

formula_72

Solving for &quot;u&quot;t gives

formula_73

Thus for a stationary observer (&quot;v&quot; = 0)

formula_74

and thus the kinetic energy takes the form

formula_75

Factoring out the rest energy gives:

formula_76

This expression reduces to the special relativistic case for the flat-space metric where

formula_77

In the Newtonian approximation to general relativity

formula_78

where Φ is the Newtonian gravitational potential. This means clocks run slower and measuring rods are shorter near massive bodies.

==Kinetic energy in quantum mechanics==
In quantum mechanics, observables like kinetic energy are represented as operators. For one particle of mass &quot;m&quot;, the kinetic energy operator appears as a term in the Hamiltonian and is defined in terms of the more fundamental momentum operator formula_79. The kinetic energy operator in the non-relativistic case can be written as

formula_80

Notice that this can be obtained by replacing formula_9 by formula_79 in the classical expression for kinetic energy in terms of momentum,

formula_83

In the Schrödinger picture, formula_79 takes the form formula_85 where the derivative is taken with respect to position coordinates and hence

formula_86

The expectation value of the electron kinetic energy, formula_87, for a system of &quot;N&quot; electrons described by the wavefunction formula_88 is a sum of 1-electron operator expectation values:

formula_89

where formula_90 is the mass of the electron and formula_91 is the Laplacian operator acting upon the coordinates of the &quot;i&quot;th electron and the summation runs over all electrons.

The density functional formalism of quantum mechanics requires knowledge of the electron density &quot;only&quot;, i.e., it formally does not require knowledge of the wavefunction. Given an electron density formula_92, the exact N-electron kinetic energy functional is unknown; however, for the specific case of a 1-electron system, the kinetic energy can be written as

formula_93

where formula_94 is known as the von Weizsäcker kinetic energy functional.

<text>The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps was an infantry rifle regiment of the British Army that was originally raised in British North America as the Royal American Regiment during the phase of the Seven Years&#x27; War in North America known in the United States as &#x27;The French and Indian War.&#x27; Subsequently numbered the 60th Regiment of Foot, the regiment served for more than 200 years throughout the British Empire. In 1958, the regiment joined the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and the Rifle Brigade in the Green Jackets Brigade and in 1966 the three regiments were formally amalgamated to become the Royal Green Jackets. The KRRC became the 2nd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets. On the disbandment of the 1st Battalion, Royal Green Jackets in 1992, the RGJ&#x27;s KRRC battalion was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, Royal Green Jackets, eventually becoming 2nd Battalion, The Rifles in 2007.

==History==

===French and Indian War===
The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps was raised in the American colonies in 1756 as the 62nd (Royal American) Regiment to defend the colonies against attack by the French and their indigenous allies. After Braddock&#x27;s defeat in 1755, royal approval for a new regiment, as well as funds, were granted by parliament just before Christmas 1755 – hence the regiment&#x27;s traditional birthday of Christmas Day. However, parliamentary delays meant that it was 4 March 1756 before a special act of parliament created four battalions of 1,000 men each to include foreigners for service in the Americas.



A regimental history compiled in 1879 states that, in November 1755, Parliament voted the sum of £81,000 for the purpose of raising a regiment of four battalions, each one thousand strong, for service in British North America. To provide experienced personnel, Parliament passed the Commissions to Foreign Protestants Act 1756 (29 Geo. 2. c. 5) The Earl of Loudoun, who as commander-in-chief of the Forces in North America, was appointed colonel-in-chief of the regiment. About fifty officers&#x27; commissions were given to Germans and Swiss, and none were allowed to rise above the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

According to a modern history of the regiment, the idea for creating this unique force was proposed by Jacques Prevost, a Swiss soldier and adventurer who was a friend of the Duke of Cumberland (the Duke was the King&#x27;s third son and also Commander-in-Chief of the Forces). Prevost recognised the need for soldiers who understood forest warfare, unlike the regulars who were brought to America in 1755 by General Edward Braddock.

The regiment was intended to combine the characteristics of a colonial corps with those of a foreign legion. Swiss and German forest fighting experts, American colonists and British volunteers from other British regiments were recruited. These men were Protestants, an important consideration for fighting against the predominantly Catholic French. The officers were also recruited from Europe – not from the American colonies – and consisted of English, Scots, Irish, Dutch, Swiss and Germans. It was the first time foreign officers were commissioned as British Army officers. In total, the regiment consisted of 101 officers, 240 non-commissioned officers and 4,160 enlisted men. The battalions were raised on Governors Island, New York. The regiment was renumbered the 60th (Royal American) Regiment in February 1757 when the 50th (Shirley&#x27;s) and 51st (Pepperrell&#x27;s) foot regiments were removed from the British Army roll after their surrender at Fort Oswego.

Among the distinguished foreign officers given commissions in the 60th (Royal Americans) was Henry Bouquet, a Swiss citizen, whose forward-looking ideas on tactics, training and man-management (including the unofficial introduction of the rifle and more practical clothing suited to bush-fighting) would come to be accepted as standard in the British Army many years in the future. Bouquet was commanding officer of the 1st battalion, and with his fellow battalion commanders, worked to form units that were better suited to warfare in the forests and lakes of northeast America.

Elements of the new regiment fought at Louisbourg in June 1758, the Cape Sable Campaign in September 1758 and Quebec in September 1759, and finally the Montreal Campaign from July to September 1760 which finally wrested Canada from France. At Quebec General James Wolfe is said to have granted the 60th the motto (Swift and Bold). To reward and maintain their service and loyalty, Parliament passed the American Protestant Soldier Naturalization Act 1762 (2 Geo. 3. c. 25), which offered British naturalization to those officers, engineers and soldiers who had or would serve for two years, with certain conditions and on the model of the Plantation Act 1740.

These earlier engagements were conventional battles on the European model, but fighting during Pontiac&#x27;s War in 1763 was of a very different character. The frontier war threatened the British control of North America. The new regiment at first lost several outlying garrisons such as Fort Michilimackinac, later a detachment fought under Bouquet&#x27;s leadership at the victory of Bushy Run in August 1763.

The 60th was uniformed and equipped in a similar manner to other British regiments with red coats and cocked hats or grenadier caps, but on campaign, swords were replaced with hatchets, and coats and hats cut down for ease of movement in the woods.

===American War of Independence===
Two additional battalions of the regiment (the 3rd and 4th battalions) were raised in England in 1775, principally of men recruited from England and Hanover in 1775 for service in the American War of Independence. After assembly in the Isle of Wight, both battalions were sent in 1776 to Florida where they were joined by detachments from 1st and 2nd Battalions. These battalions were deployed to Georgia and were involved in skirmishes at Sudbury in January 1779, the Battle of Briar Creek in March 1779, the Siege of Savannah in October 1779 where elements from the 4th Battalion captured the colour of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment, and at Augusta in September 1780. The 3rd battalion later took part in the British defense of the Gulf Coast. Elements of the battalion fought at the Battle at The Village and the Siege of Pensacola. The 3rd and 4th battalions were disbanded in June 1783.

===Napoleonic Wars===

During the Napoleonic Wars, the regiment saw action in the Peninsular War. The first four battalions had been raised as regular line battalions, but in 1797 a 5th battalion had been raised on Barbados, with additional companies formed on the Isle of Wight, and equipped entirely with rifles. The troops of the 5th battalion were so effective that Sir Arthur Wellesley recommended their use to the divisional commanders describing them as the &quot;most useful, active and brave troops in the field&quot;.

A 7th battalion was raised specifically for service in the American War of 1812.

===Anglo-Egyptian War and Second Boer War===
After the Napoleonic Wars, the regiment received a new title: first, in 1815, its name was changed to The Duke of York&#x27;s Own Rifle Corps and then, in 1830, to the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC). In 1858, the Rifle Depot at Winchester was made their headquarters. The regiment served in the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. During the rest of the 1800s, the unit also was active in China, Canada (Wolseley expedition), Afghanistan, India, Burma and South Africa. The regiment was deployed during the Second Boer War from the outset playing a key role in the first battle at Talana Hill. Two officers from the regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross; Lieutenant Frederick Roberts and Lieutenant Llewelyn Alberic Emilius Price-Davies. Private Frederick Corbett also received the Victoria Cross for his action at Kafr Dowar, Egypt, on 5 August 1882; his VC was later rescinded when he was convicted of embezzlement, theft, and being absent without leave.

Following the end of the war in South Africa, the 1st battalion was transferred to Malta, where it arrived in October 1902.

In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had two Reserve but no Territorial battalions.

Seven members of the regiment received the Victoria Cross.

===Inter-war years===
After 1918, the unit returned to garrison duties in India, Palestine and Ireland. In 1922, the regiment was reduced from four to two battalions with the third and fourth being disbanded. In 1926, the Regiment was reorganised as one of the first mechanised infantry regiments.

===Second World War===
The 1st Battalion, KRRC, commanded initially by Lieutenant Colonel William Gott, was deployed to North Africa upon war&#x27;s outbreak and saw action as part of the pivot group within the 7th Armoured Division at the Battle of Sidi Rezegh in November 1941, the First Battle of El Alamein in July 1942 and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 during the Western Desert Campaign. Rifleman John Beeley was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions during Operation Crusader in North Africa in late 1941. The battalion, now part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division, was then engaged in action throughout the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign. The battalion, now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Edward Williams, served in the Italian Campaign then with the independent 9th Armoured Brigade and finally the 6th Armoured Division&#x27;s 61st Infantry Brigade.

The 2nd Battalion, KRRC, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Wilson, was part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that landed in France in May 1940. The battalion, which was part of the 30th Infantry Brigade, 1st Armoured Division, and now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Euan Miller, was lost in the defence of Calais, where the brigade slowed the German advance and enabled the Dunkirk evacuation to proceed. The battalion was reformed in the summer of 1940 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Erskine and transferred to the 22nd Armoured Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division. The reformed battalion took part in the Battle of Gazala in May 1942 and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 during the North African Campaign, forming part of the division&#x27;s 7th Motor Brigade during the latter engagement and transferring to 4th Armoured Brigade in January 1943. Now under Lieutenant Colonel W. Heathcote-Amory, the battalion continued serving with 4th Armoured Brigade in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and the subsequent campaign in North-West Europe, finally leaving 1st Division six days after VE Day. Two officers of note served with the battalion in its final campaign of the war, Roland Gibbs and Edwin Bramall.

The 1st Battalion of the Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles (QFR) was a Territorial Army (TA) unit which had been closely associated with the KRRC. The battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. A. M. Elison-Mccartney, was initially part of the TA 1st London Division, serving as the division&#x27;s motorcycle battalion. However, like the 2nd Battalion, it was also lost in the defence of Calais in May 1940. The battalion was later reformed in the United Kingdom and, in December 1940, transferred to the 27th Armoured Brigade, part of the newly formed 9th Armoured Division.

The 9th Battalion (The Rangers) was deployed to the Mediterranean theatre as part of the 1st Armoured Brigade in the 7th Armoured Division. It saw action in the Greek campaign in April 1941 before being disbanded in August 1942.

===Royal Green Jackets and The Rifles===
In 1958 for administrative purposes, the KRRC was brigaded with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and the Rifle Brigade to form the Green Jackets Brigade. In 1958, the regiment was re-titled the 2nd Green Jackets, the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, while the two other regiments of the Green Jackets Brigade were re-titled the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) and 3rd Green Jackets, the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) respectively. In 1966, the three regiments were amalgamated to form the three battalions of the Royal Green Jackets.

==Regimental museum==
The regimental collection is held by the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum which is based at Peninsula Barracks in Winchester.

==Territorial battalions==
The territorial battalions were as follows:
*Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles
*The Rangers
*The Queen&#x27;s Westminsters

In the Second World War, the following territorial battalions were formally made part of the KRRC:
*1st Battalion Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles – 7th Battalion KRRC
*2nd Battalion Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles – 8th Battalion KRRC
*1st Battalion The Rangers – 9th Battalion KRRC
*2nd Battalion The Rangers – 10th Battalion KRRC
*1st Battalion The Queen&#x27;s Westminsters – 11th Battalion KRRC
*2nd Battalion The Queen&#x27;s Westminsters – 12th Battalion KRRC

==Cadet battalions==
There were two cadet battalions: 1st Cadet Battalion, The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps and Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles Cadet Corps (re-titled the 2nd Cadet Battalion, The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps in 1945). Over the years, the formation of the cadet battalions was changed regularly, due to the changes to do with rules and the commanding officer. The 1st Cadet Battalion owes its foundation to the Reverend Freeman Wills, who was commissioned into the Volunteer Army in the rank of captain on 26 July 1890. He was also Vicar of St Agatha&#x27;s just behind Sun Street, Finsbury Square. On receiving his commission he decided to form a cadet company within the 1st Cadet Battalion, the Royal West Surrey Regiment. The company quickly expanded to become the 2nd Cadet Battalion, the Royal West Surrey Regiment, at which point he moved the battalion headquarters to No. 2 Finsbury Square (and in 1904 to 24 Sun Street, which he had specially built for the purpose). In 1894 he applied to Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, Colonel-in-Chief, to affiliate to the regiment, with the title of 1st Cadet Battalion, the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps. Consent was granted on 8 November 1894, and the battalion has remained a part of the regiment ever since.

In the days of their foundation, cadet battalions were privately organized and funded. On becoming a part of the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, subscriptions began to flow in and, after the commanding officer had spent nearly £1,000, the battalion was placed on a financial basis that many volunteer corps would have envied. There were to be many ups and down in later years, especially when recognition of the Cadet Force was withdrawn between the two world wars, but fortunately the enthusiasm and commitment of those involved consistently triumphed over the parsimony of governments.

In 1900, when volunteers were urgently needed for the Second Boer War, the commanding officer, Colonel Freeman Croft-Wills, persuaded the War Office to accept a company of the older cadets, principally N.C.O.s (non-commissioned officers), the company being enrolled in the City Imperial Volunteers. Around 100 cadets thus served in South Africa with this unit, whilst other cadets and ex-cadets served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and other units. Four were killed in action, one serving with the 1st Battalion King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps at the Battle of Dundee, and the others with units of the C.I.V.s. Their comrades erected brass plaques in their memory in the Drill Hall at Sun Street. These are now displayed in the Cadet Company Office here at Davies Street.

In recognition of this service, King Edward VII granted the battalion the honour of wearing on its accoutrements the battle honour &quot;South Africa 1900–1902&quot; (Army Order 151 of 1905). The announcement of this privilege was made to the battalion by King George V, then Prince of Wales, when, accompanied by Queen Mary, he distributed the prizes at the Guildhall in the City of London. The 1st Cadet Battalion King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps are the only cadet unit in the United Kingdom to have been granted such an honour and are permitted to wear the miniature 60th cap badge with the single battle honour, and call their cadets &quot;riflemen&quot;.

The 2nd Cadet Battalion, the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps was formed in 1942 when a Home Guard instruction was issued ordering each Home Guard battalion to raise a cadet unit. Lieutenant-Colonel R.L. Clark of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles was given the task, and on 15 May 1942 the Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles Cadet Corps was born. Over the next three years the unit expanded to five companies, which in April 1945 led to it being re-titled the 2nd Cadet Battalion, The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps. In 1951 the 1st and 2nd Cadet Battalion were amalgamated. This resulted in the disposal of the headquarters of the 1st Cadet Battalion at Sun Street. In 1954, the battalion office of the &#x27;new&#x27; 1st Cadet Battalion was established at 56 Davies Street, where it remains to this day.

Today, the KRRC 1st Cadet Battalion still exists, with the following units making up the battalion:

*A Company, 231 KRRC (Paddington) Rifles ACF
*B Company, 232 KRRC (Westminster) Rifles ACF
*C Company, 233 KRRC (Camden) Rifles ACF
*D Company, 234 KRRC (Putney) Rifles ACF 
All these ACF units are currently in the Middlesex and Northwest London Sector Army Cadet Force.

<doc id="17333" wikidata="Q33614" url="?curid=17333" title="Khoisan languages">
<text>The Khoisan languages ( ; also Khoesan or Khoesaan) are a number of African languages once classified together, originally by Joseph Greenberg. Khoisan is defined as those languages that have click consonants and do not belong to other African language families. For much of the 20th century, they were thought to be genealogically related to each other, but this is no longer accepted. They are now held to comprise three distinct language families and two language isolates.

All but two Khoisan languages are indigenous to southern Africa and belong to three language families. The Khoe family appears to have migrated to southern Africa not long before the Bantu expansion. Ethnically, their speakers are the Khoikhoi and the San (Bushmen). Two languages of east Africa, those of the Sandawe and Hadza, originally were also classified as Khoisan, although their speakers are ethnically neither Khoikhoi nor San.

Before the Bantu expansion, Khoisan languages, or languages like them, were likely spread throughout southern and eastern Africa. They are currently restricted to the Kalahari Desert, primarily in Namibia and Botswana, and to the Rift Valley in central Tanzania.

Most of the languages are endangered, and several are moribund or extinct. Most have no written record. The only widespread Khoisan language is Khoekhoe (also known as Khoekhoegowab, Nàmá or Damara) of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa, with a quarter of a million speakers; Sandawe in Tanzania is second in number with some 40–80,000, some monolingual; and the ǃKung language of the northern Kalahari spoken by some 16,000 or so people. Language use is quite strong among the 20,000 speakers of Naro, half of whom speak it as a second language.

Khoisan languages are best known for their use of click consonants as phonemes. These are typically written with characters such as [[Postalveolar click|ǃ]] and [[Palatal click|ǂ]]. Clicks are quite versatile as consonants, as they involve two articulations of the tongue which can operate partially independently. Consequently, the languages with the greatest numbers of consonants in the world are Khoisan. The Juǀʼhoan language has 48 click consonants among nearly as many non-click consonants, strident and pharyngealized vowels, and four tones. The ǃXóõ and ǂHõã languages are even more complex.

==Validity==
Khoisan was proposed as one of the four families of African languages in Joseph Greenberg&#x27;s classification (1949–1954, revised in 1963). However, linguists who study Khoisan languages reject their unity, and the name &quot;Khoisan&quot; is used by them as a term of convenience without any implication of linguistic validity, much as &quot;Papuan&quot; and &quot;Australian&quot; are. It has been suggested that the similarities of the Tuu and Kxʼa families are due to a southern African Sprachbund rather than a genealogical relationship, whereas the Khoe (or perhaps Kwadi–Khoe) family is a more recent migrant to the area, and may be related to Sandawe in East Africa.

Ernst Oswald Johannes Westphal is known for his early rejection of the Khoisan language family (Starostin 2003). Bonny Sands (1998) concluded that the family is not demonstrable with current evidence. Anthony Traill at first accepted Khoisan (Traill 1986), but by 1998 concluded that it could not be demonstrated with current data and methods, rejecting it as based on a single typological criterion: the presence of clicks. Dimmendaal (2008) summarized the general view with, &quot;it has to be concluded that Greenberg&#x27;s intuitions on the genetic unity of Khoisan could not be confirmed by subsequent research. Today, the few scholars working on these languages treat the three [southern groups] as independent language families that cannot or can no longer be shown to be genetically related&quot; (p. 841). Starostin (2013) accepts a relationship between Sandawe and Khoi is plausible, as is one between Tuu and Kxʼa, but sees no indication of a relationship between Sandawe and Khoi on the one hand and Tuu and Kxʼa on the other, or between any of them and Hadza.

Janina Brutt-Griffler claims, &quot;given that such colonial borders were generally arbitrarily drawn, they grouped large numbers of ethnic groups that spoke many languages.&quot; She hypothesizes that this took place within efforts to prevent the spread of English during European colonization and prevent the entrance of the majority into the middle class.

==Khoisan language variation==
Anthony Traill noted the Khoisan languages&#x27; extreme variation. Despite their shared clicks, the Khoisan languages diverge significantly from each other. Traill demonstrated this linguistic diversity in the data presented in the below table. The first two columns include words from the two Khoisan language isolates, Sandawe and Hadza. The following three are languages from the Khoe family, the Kxʼa family, and the Tuu family, respectively.

==Families==
The branches that were once considered part of so-called Khoisan are now considered independent families, since it has not been demonstrated that they are related according to the standard comparative method.

See Khoe languages for speculations on the linguistic history of the region.

===Hadza===

With about 800 speakers in Tanzania, Hadza is no longer seen as a Khoisan language and appears to be unrelated to any other language. Genetically, the Hadza people are unrelated to the Khoisan peoples of Southern Africa, and their closest relatives may be among the Pygmies of Central Africa.

===Sandawe===

There is some indication that Sandawe (about 40,000 speakers in Tanzania) may be related to the Khoe family, such as a congruent pronominal system and some good Swadesh-list matches, but not enough to establish regular sound correspondences. Sandawe is not related to Hadza, despite their proximity.

===Khoe===

The Khoe family is both the most numerous and diverse family of Khoisan languages, with seven living languages and over a quarter million speakers. Although little Kwadi data is available, proto-Khoe–Kwadi reconstructions have been made for pronouns and some basic vocabulary.
*?Khoe–Kwadi
**Kwadi (extinct)
**Khoe
***Khoekhoe This branch appears to have been affected by the Kxʼa–Tuu &quot;sprachbund&quot;.
****Nama (ethnonyms Khoekhoen, Nama, Damara) (a dialect cluster including ǂAakhoe and Haiǁom)
****Eini (extinct)
****South Khoekhoe
*****Korana (moribund)
*****Xiri (moribund; a dialect cluster)
***Tshu–Khwe (or &quot;Kalahari)&quot; Many of these languages have undergone partial click loss.
****East Tshu–Khwe (East Kalahari)
*****Shua (a dialect cluster including Deti, Tsʼixa, ǀXaise, and Ganádi)
*****Tsoa (a dialect cluster including Cire Cire and Kua)
****West Tshu–Khwe (West Kalahari)
*****Kxoe (a dialect cluster including ǁAni and Buga)
*****Naro (a dialect cluster, including ǂHaba)
*****Gǁana–Gǀwi (a dialect cluster including Gǁana and Gǀwi)
A Haiǁom language is listed in most Khoisan references. A century ago the Haiǁom people spoke a Ju dialect, probably close to ǃKung, but they now speak a divergent dialect of Nama. Thus their language is variously said to be extinct or to have 18,000 speakers, to be Ju or to be Khoe. (Their numbers have been included under Nama above.) They are known as the &quot;Saa&quot; by the Nama, and this is the source of the word &quot;San&quot;.

===Tuu===

The Tuu family consists of two language clusters, which are related to each other at about the distance of Khoekhoe and Tshukhwe within Khoe. They are typologically very similar to the Kxʼa languages (below), but have not been demonstrated to be related to them genealogically (the similarities may be an areal feature).
*Tuu
**Taa
***ǃXoon (4200 speakers. A dialect cluster.)
***Lower Nossob (Two dialects, ǀʼAuni and ǀHaasi. Extinct.)
**ǃKwi
***Nǁng (1 speaker. A dialect cluster.)
***ǀXam (A dialect cluster. Extinct.)
***ǂUngkue (A dialect cluster. Extinct.)
***ǁXegwi (Extinct.)
===Kxʼa===

The Kxʼa family is a relatively distant relationship formally demonstrated in 2010.
*Kxʼa
**ǂʼAmkoe (200 speakers, Botswana. Moribund. A dialect cluster of Nǃaqriaxe, (Eastern) ǂHoan, and Sasi).
**ǃKung (also &quot;ǃXun&quot; or &quot;Ju,&quot; formerly &quot;Northern Khoisan)&quot; is a dialect cluster. (~45,000 speakers.) Juǀʼhoan is the best-known dialect.
===Classification by Starostin (2013)===
Starostin (2013) gives the following classification of the Khoisan &quot;macrofamily,&quot; which he considers to be a single coherent language family. However, this classification is not widely accepted.
* Khoisan
** Hadza
** Macro-Khoisan (excl. Hadza)
*** Sandawe-Khoi-Kwadi
**** Sandawe
**** Khoi-Kwadi
***** Kwadi
***** Khoe (= Khoi)
****** Khoikhoi
****** Kalahari Khoi
*** Peripheral Khoisan
**** Southern Khoisan (= !Kwi-Taa ~ Tuu)
***** !Kwi
***** Taa
**** Ju-hoan
***** Western Hoan
***** Northern Khoisan (= Ju)
==Other &quot;click languages&quot;==
Not all languages using clicks as phonemes are considered Khoisan. Most others are neighboring Bantu languages in southern Africa: the Nguni languages (Xhosa, Zulu, Swazi, Phuthi, and Northern Ndebele); Sotho; Yeyi in Botswana; and Mbukushu, Kwangali, and Gciriku in the Caprivi Strip. Clicks are spreading to a few additional neighboring languages. Of these languages, Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele and Yeyi have intricate systems of click consonants; the others, despite the click in the name &quot;Gciriku,&quot; more rudimentary ones. There is also the South Cushitic language Dahalo in Kenya, which has dental clicks in a few score words, and an extinct and presumably artificial Australian ritual language called Damin, which had only nasal clicks.

The Bantu languages adopted the use of clicks from neighboring, displaced, or absorbed Khoisan populations (or from other Bantu languages), often through intermarriage, while the Dahalo are thought to have retained clicks from an earlier language when they shifted to speaking a Cushitic language; if so, the pre-Dahalo language may have been something like Hadza or Sandawe. Damin is an invented ritual language, and has nothing to do with Khoisan.

These are the only languages known to have clicks in normal vocabulary. Occasionally other languages are said by laypeople to have &quot;click&quot; sounds. This is usually a misnomer for ejective consonants, which are found across much of the world, or is a reference to paralinguistic use of clicks such as English &quot;tsk! tsk!&quot;

<text>Katina Paxinou (; 17 December 1900– 22 February 1973) was a Greek film and stage actress.

She started her stage career in Greece in 1928 and was one of the founding members of the National Theatre of Greece in 1932. The outbreak of World War II found her in the United Kingdom and she later moved to the United States, where she made her film debut in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943) and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. She appeared in a few more Hollywood films, before returning to Greece in the early 1950s. She became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1951. She then focused on her stage career and appeared in a number of European films including &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (1960).

==Early life==
Paxinou was born Ekaterini Konstantopoulou in 1900, the daughter of Vassilis Konstantopoulos and Eleni Malandrinou. She trained as an opera singer at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève and later in Berlin and Vienna. According to her biography in a 1942 &quot;Playbill&quot;, Paxinou&#x27;s family disowned her after she decided to seek a permanent stage career.

==Career==

Paxinou made her debut at the Municipal Theatre of Piraeus in 1920 in the operatic version of Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Sister Beatrice&quot;, with a score by Dimitri Mitropoulos. She first appeared in a play in 1928, as a member of Marika Kotopouli&#x27;s troupe, in an Athens production of Henry Bataille&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Woman&quot;. In 1931, she joined Aimilios Veakis&#x27; troupe along with Alexis Minotis, where she translated and appeared in the first of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s plays to be staged in Greece, &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot;. She also appeared in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Father&quot;.

In 1932, Paxinou was among the actors who inaugurated the recently re-founded National Theatre of Greece, where she worked until 1940. During her stay in the National Theatre, she distinguished herself on Greek stage starring in major plays, such as Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Electra&quot;, Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; and William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which were also performed in London, Frankfurt and Berlin.
When World War II began, Paxinou was performing in London. Unable to return to Greece, she emigrated in May 1941 to the United States, where she had earlier appeared in 1931, performing Clytemnestra in a modern Greek version of &quot;Electra&quot;.
She was selected to play the role of Pilar in the film &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), for which she won an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture. She made one British film, &quot;Uncle Silas&quot; (1947), which features Jean Simmons in the main female role and worked in Italy for 20th Century Fox, playing the mother of Tyrone Power&#x27;s character in &quot;Prince of Foxes&quot; (1949). Katina Paxinou also played the role of Sophie, in the film &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot;, (1955), directed and written by Orson Welles in which he played Arkadin, the main character. After this film, Paxinou worked for a Hollywood studio only once more, again playing a gypsy woman in the religious epic &quot;The Miracle&quot; (1959).

In 1950, Paxinou resumed her stage career. In her native Greece, she formed the Royal Theatre of Athens with Alexis Minotis, her principal director and husband since 1940.

Paxinou made several appearances on the Broadway stage and television as well. She played the lead in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; for 12 performances at New York City&#x27;s Longacre Theatre, opening on 28 June 1942. She also played the principal role in the first production in English of Federico Garcia Lorca&#x27;s &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot;, at the ANTA Playhouse in New York in 1951, and a BBC television production of Lorca&#x27;s &quot;Blood Wedding&quot; (&quot;Bodas de sangre&quot;), broadcast on 2 June 1959.

==Death==
Paxinou died after a long battle with cancer in Athens on 22 February 1973 at the age of 72. She was survived by her husband and her one daughter from her first marriage to Ioannis Paxinos, whose surname she continued using after their divorce. Her remains are buried at First Cemetery of Athens.

==Museum==
The Paxinou-Minotis Museum is an Athens museum featuring memorabilia of the life of Paxinou, including furniture, paintings and sketches, photographs, books and personal effects donated by Paxinou&#x27;s husband, director Alexis Minotis, and include his personal library and theatrical archive.

<doc id="17335" wikidata="Q77088" url="?curid=17335" title="Klaus Barbie">
<text>Nikolaus Barbie (25 October 1913 – 25 September 1991) was a German officer of the Schutzstaffel and Sicherheitsdienst who worked in Vichy France during World War II. He became known as the &quot;Butcher of Lyon&quot; for having personally tortured prisoners—primarily Jews and members of the French Resistance—as the head of the Gestapo in Lyon. After the war, United States intelligence services employed him for his anti-communist efforts and aided his escape to Bolivia, where he advised the dictatorial regime on how to repress opposition through torture. In 1983, the United States apologised to France for the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps helping him escape to Bolivia, aiding Barbie&#x27;s escape from an outstanding arrest warrant.

In 1972, it was discovered he was in Bolivia. While in Bolivia, the West German Intelligence Service recruited him. Barbie is suspected of having had a role in the Bolivian coup d&#x27;état orchestrated by Luis García Meza in 1980. After the fall of the dictatorship, Barbie lost the protection of the government in La Paz. In 1983, he was arrested and extradited to France, where he was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison. Although he had been sentenced to death in absentia twice earlier, in 1947 and 1954, capital punishment had been abolished in France in 1981. Barbie died of cancer in 1991, at age 77, in his Lyon prison.

==Early life and education==
Nikolaus &quot;Klaus&quot; Barbie was born on 25 October 1913 in Godesberg, which is today part of Bonn. The Barbie family came from Merzig, in the Saar near the border with France. In 1914, his father, also named Nikolaus, was conscripted to fight in the First World War. He was wounded in the neck at Verdun and captured by the French, and he never recovered his health. Until 1923, when he was 10, Klaus Barbie attended the local school where his father taught. Afterwards, he attended a boarding school in Trier, and was relieved to be away from his father, who abused him. In 1925, the entire Barbie family moved to Trier.

In June 1933, Barbie&#x27;s younger brother Kurt died, at the age of 18, of a chronic illness. Later that year, their father also died. The death of his father derailed plans for the 20-year-old Barbie to study theology. While unemployed, Barbie was conscripted into the Reich Labour Service. On 26 September 1935, aged 22, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) as member 272,284, and began working in the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), the SS security service, which acted as the intelligence-gathering arm of the Nazi Party. On 1 May 1937, he became member 4,583,085 of the Nazi Party.

==Second World War==
After the German conquest and occupation of the Netherlands, Barbie was assigned to Amsterdam. He had been pre-assigned to Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s Amt (Department) IV/B-4. This department was responsible for the identification, roundup, and deportation of Dutch Communists, Jews and Freemasons. On 11 October 1940, Barbie arrested , Grand Master of the Grand Orient of the Netherlands. In March 1941, van Tongeren was transported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp where, in freezing conditions, he died two weeks later. On 1 April, Barbie summoned van Tongeren&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte, to SD headquarters and informed her that her father had died of an infection in both ears and had been cremated.

In 1942, he was sent to Dijon, in the Occupied Zone of France. In November of the same year, at the age of 29, he was assigned to Lyon as the head of the local Gestapo. He established his headquarters at the Hôtel Terminus in Lyon, where he personally tortured adult and child prisoners. He became known as the &quot;Butcher of Lyon&quot;. The daughter of a French Resistance leader based in Lyon said her father was beaten and his skin torn, and that his head was immersed in buckets of ammonia and cold water; he could not sit or stand and died three days later from burns to his skin. Other tortures included training German shepherd dogs to bite and using them to rape naked women.

It has been estimated that Barbie was directly responsible for the deportation of up to 14,000 Jews and resistance fighters, personally participating in roundups such as the Rue Sainte-Catherine Roundup which saw 84 people arrested in a single day. He arrested Jean Moulin, a high-ranking member of the French Resistance and his most prominent captive. In 1943, he was awarded the Iron Cross (First Class) by Adolf Hitler for his campaign against the French Resistance and the capture of Moulin.

In April 1944, Barbie ordered the deportation to Auschwitz of a group of 44 Jewish children from an orphanage at Izieu. He then rejoined the SiPo-SD of Lyon in its retreat to Bruyères, where he led an anti-partisan attack in Rehaupal in September 1944.

==US intelligence work in post-War Europe==
In 1947, Barbie was recruited as an agent for the 66th Detachment of the US Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) along with a Serbian agent of the Belgrade special police and SD, Radislav Grujičić. The US used Barbie and other Nazi Party members to further anti-communist efforts in Europe. Specifically, they were interested in British interrogation techniques which Barbie had experienced firsthand, as well as the identities of former SS officers British intelligence agencies might be interested in recruiting. Later, the CIC housed him in a hotel in Memmingen; he reported on French intelligence activities in the French zone of occupied Germany because they suspected that the French had been infiltrated by the KGB and GPU.

The US Department of Justice report to the US Senate in 1983 opens with the summary paragraph:

As the investigation of Klaus Barbie has shown, officers of the United States government were directly responsible for protecting a person wanted by the government of France on criminal charges and in arranging his escape from the law. As a direct result of that action, Klaus Barbie did not stand trial in France in 1950; he spent 33 years as a free man and a fugitive from justice.

The French discovered that Barbie was in U.S. hands; having sentenced him to death in absentia for war crimes, they made a plea to John J. McCloy, US High Commissioner for Germany, to hand him over for execution, but McCloy refused. Instead, the CIC helped him flee to Bolivia assisted by &quot;ratlines&quot; organised by US intelligence services, as well as by Croatian Roman Catholic clergy, including Krunoslav Draganović. The CIC asserted that Barbie knew too much about the network of German spies the CIC had planted in various European communist organisations. It was suspicious of communist influence within the Government of France, but their protection of Barbie may have been as much to avoid the embarrassment of having recruited him in the first place. Other authors have suggested that the anticommunist element of Italian fascism and the protection of the Vatican allowed Klaus Barbie and other Nazis to flee to Bolivia.

In 1965, Barbie was recruited by the West German foreign intelligence agency &quot;Bundesnachrichtendienst&quot; (BND), under the codename and the registration number V-43118. His initial monthly salary of 500 Deutsche Marks was transferred in May 1966 to an account of the Chartered Bank of London in San Francisco. During his time with the BND, Barbie made at least 35 reports to the BND headquarters in Pullach.

==Bolivia==
Barbie immigrated to Bolivia in 1951, where he lived well for 30 years in Cochabamba, under the alias Klaus Altmann. It was easier and less embarrassing for him to find employment there than in Europe; he enjoyed excellent relations with high-ranking Bolivian officials, including Bolivian dictators Hugo Banzer and Luis García Meza. &quot;Altmann&quot; was known for his German nationalist and anti-communist stances. While engaged in arms-trade operations in Bolivia, he was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel within the Bolivian Armed Forces.

Barbie collaborated with René Barrientos&#x27;s regime, including teaching the general&#x27;s private paramilitaries named &quot;Furmont&quot; how torture can best be used. The regime&#x27;s political repression against leftist groups was helped by Barbie&#x27;s knowledge about intelligence work, torture and interrogations. In 1972 under General Banzer (with whom Barbie collaborated even more openly), he assisted in illegal arrests, interrogations and murders of opposition and progressive groups. Journalists and activists who wrote or spoke about the regime&#x27;s crimes against human rights were arrested and many fell victim to so-called &quot;disappearances&quot;, the state&#x27;s secret murders and abductions of leftists. Barbie actively participated in the regime&#x27;s oppression of opponents.

Barbie was strongly linked to the neo-Nazi paramilitary member Álvaro de Castro, who was his personally hired bodyguard and the two participated in criminal actions and businesses together. De Castro had connections with powerful drug barons and the illegal drug trade and, together with Barbie (under the name Altmann) and an Austrian company, sold weapons to the drug cartels. When De Castro was arrested he admitted in interviews that he had earlier worked for drug lords in the country. Other sources say Barbie most likely also had connections with these organizations. Initially, he worked for Roberto Suárez Gómez who eventually introduced him to Colombian traffickers. Barbie met with Pablo Escobar and several other high ranking members of the Medellín cartel in the late 1970s, and agreed to arrange for security of Escobar&#x27;s raw coca supply, from its cultivation until it reached processing plants in Colombia. In exchange, Escobar agreed to fund Barbie&#x27;s anti-communist activities. De Castro continued to correspond with Barbie when Barbie was later under arrest. Their connections also provided intelligence information to U.S. authorities at the U.S. Embassy. A group called &quot;The Fiancés of Death&quot;, which included German Nazis and Fascists, had links to some of Barbie&#x27;s actions in Bolivia. 
Barbie earlier also carried out a large arms purchase of tanks from Austria to the Bolivian army. These were then used in a coup d&#x27;état.

According to various reports, after the emergence of Che Guevara in Bolivia in 1966, Barbie&#x27;s anti-partisan skills were in demand again, and he worked for the Bolivian Interior Ministry with the rank of Lieutenant as an instructor and adviser to the security forces. During an interview, Alvaro de Castro claimed that Barbie constantly &quot;boasted of hunting down Che&quot;.

People who met Barbie during his time in Bolivia have said that he was a firm and fanatical believer in the Nazi ideology and an anti-Semite. Barbie and De Castro reportedly talked about the cases and searches for Josef Mengele and Adolf Eichmann, whom Barbie supported and wanted to assist in remaining on the run.

==Manhunt==

Barbie was identified as being in Peru in 1971 by Serge and Beate Klarsfeld (Nazi hunters from France), who came across a secret document that revealed his alias. On 19 January 1972, this information was published in the French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;, along with a photograph of Altmann which the Klarsfelds obtained from a German expatriate living in Lima, Peru. In Peru, Barbie provided security services to the junta of General Juan Velasco Alvarado following the military coup of 3 October 1968, including surveillance of the U.S. diplomatic mission led by John Irwin in March 1969.

Led by Beate Klarsfeld, French journalist Ladislas de Hoyos and cameraman Christian van Ryswyck flew to La Paz in January 1972 in order to find and interview Barbie posing as his alias, Klaus Altmann. The interview took place on 3 February 1972 in the Department of the Interior building and the following day, in prison, where Barbie was placed under protection by the Bolivian authorities. In the videotape, and while the interview was conducted in Spanish, Ladislas de Hoyos steers away from the previously agreed upon questions by asking whether Barbie has ever been to Lyon in French, a language he is not supposed to understand under his fake identity, to which Klaus Barbie automatically responds by the negative in German. Ladislas de Hoyos gave him photos of members of Resistance he had tortured, asking him if he recognized their faces, and, while he returned them in denial, his fingerprints unmistakably betrayed him. It was in this interview, later broadcast on French TV Channel Antenne 2, that he was recognized by French resistance member Simone Lagrange, who had been tortured by Klaus Barbie in 1944.

The testimony of Italian insurgent Stefano Delle Chiaie before the Italian Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism suggests that Barbie took part in the Roberto Suárez Gómez supported 1980 coup d&#x27;état &quot;cocaine coup&quot; of Luis García Meza, when the regime forced its way to power in Bolivia in 1980.

==Extradition, trial and death==

In February 1983, the newly elected democratic government of Hernán Siles Zuazo arrested Barbie in La Paz on the pretext of his owing the government US$10,000 for goods he was supposed to have delivered but did not. A few days later, the government delivered him to France to stand trial.

Shortly after Barbie&#x27;s extradition, evidence emerged that Barbie had worked for U.S. intelligence in Germany and that U.S. agents may have been instrumental in Barbie&#x27;s flight to Bolivia to escape prosecution in France. Allan Ryan, Director of the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) of the U.S. Justice Department, recommended to U.S. Attorney General William French Smith that the matter be investigated. Following a lengthy investigation and a full report that was released to the public, Ryan concluded that &quot;officers of the United States government were directly responsible for protecting a person wanted by the government of France on criminal charges and in arranging his escape from the law.&quot;

Ryan felt that the initial decision by the U.S. government to use Barbie during Cold War counter-intelligence work, while reprehensible in light of his war crimes, might be defended on national security interest grounds. Doing so was no different from what other World War II victor nations were doing at the time; it appeared to have been done without any U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) knowledge of Barbie&#x27;s atrocities in Lyon. After those atrocities became well publicised, however, Ryan regarded it as indefensible for CIC personnel to lie to higher U.S. authorities and help Barbie escape Europe to Bolivia rather than honour an outstanding French warrant for his arrest. As a result of Ryan&#x27;s report and personal recommendation, the U.S. government made a formal apology to France for enabling Barbie to escape French justice for 33 years.

In 1984, Barbie was indicted for crimes committed as Gestapo chief in Lyon between 1942 and 1944, chief among which was the Rue Sainte-Catherine Roundup. The jury trial started on 11 May 1987 in Lyon before the Rhône &quot;Cour d&#x27;Assises&quot;. The head prosecutor was Pierre Truche. One witness at the trial was Michel Thomas, a Polish polyglot Jew, who had narrowly escaped arrest by Barbie in Lyon during World War II.

Barbie&#x27;s defence was funded by Swiss pro-Nazi financier François Genoud and led by attorney Jacques Vergès. Barbie was tried on 41 separate counts of crimes against humanity. The father of French Minister for Justice Robert Badinter had died in Sobibor after being deported from Lyon during Barbie&#x27;s tenure.

Barbie gave his name as Klaus Altmann, the name that he used while in Bolivia. He claimed that his extradition was technically illegal and asked to be excused from the trial and returned to his cell at Prison Saint-Paul. This was granted. He was brought back to court on 26 May 1987 to face some of his accusers, about whose testimony he had &quot;nothing to say&quot;.

Barbie&#x27;s defence lawyer, Jacques Vergès, had a reputation for attacking the French political system, particularly in the historic French colonial empire. His strategy was to use the trial to talk about war crimes committed by France since 1945. He got the prosecution to drop some of the charges against Barbie due to French legislation that had protected French citizens accused of the same crimes under the Vichy regime and in French Algeria. Vergès argued that Barbie&#x27;s actions were no worse than the supposedly ordinary actions of colonialists worldwide, and that his trial was tantamount to selective prosecution. Barbie&#x27;s final statement, spoken in French, was: &quot;I never committed the roundup in Izieu. I fought the Résistance, which I respect, with toughness but that was war, and the war is over.&quot;

The court rejected the defence&#x27;s argument, and on 4 July 1987, Barbie was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in Lyon (of leukemia, 
and prostate cancer) four years later, at the age of 77.

==Personal life==
In April 1939, Barbie became engaged to Regina Margaretta Willms, the 23-year-old daughter of a postal clerk; they had two children, a son named Klaus-Georg Altmann and a daughter named Ute Messner.

In 1983, Françoise Croizier, Klaus Barbie&#x27;s French daughter-in-law, said in an interview that the CIA kidnapped Klaus-Georg in 1946 to make sure that his father carried out intelligence missions for the agency. Croizier met Klaus-Georg while both were students in Paris; they married in 1968, had three children and lived in Europe and Bolivia using the surname &quot;Altmann&quot;. Croizier said that, when she married, she did not know who her father-in-law was, but that she could guess the reasons for a German to settle in South America after the war. Klaus-Georg died in a hang-gliding accident in 1981.

<text>Kashmir ( or ) is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term &quot;Kashmir&quot; denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. The term has since come to encompass a larger area that includes the India-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the Pakistan-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.


In 1820, the Sikh Empire, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the &quot;paramountcy&quot; (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Kashmir&quot; is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as &quot;&quot;. A popular local etymology of &quot;Kashmira&quot; is that it is land desiccated from water. 

An alternative etymology derives the name from the name of the Vedic sage Kashyapa who is believed to have settled people in this land. Accordingly, &quot;Kashmir&quot; would be derived from either &quot;kashyapa-mir&quot; (Kashyapa&#x27;s Lake) or &quot;kashyapa-meru&quot; (Kashyapa&#x27;s Mountain).

The word has been referenced to in a Hindu scripture mantra worshipping the Hindu goddess Sharada and is mentioned to have resided in the land of &quot;kashmira&quot;, or which might have been a reference to the Sharada Peeth.

The Ancient Greeks called the region &quot;Kasperia&quot;, which has been identified with &quot;Kaspapyros&quot; of Hecataeus of Miletus (apud Stephanus of Byzantium) and &quot;Kaspatyros&quot; of Herodotus (3.102, 4.44). Kashmir is also believed to be the country meant by Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Kaspeiria&quot;. The earliest text which directly mentions the name &quot;Kashmir&quot; is in &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot; written by the Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini during the 5th century BC. Pāṇini called the people of Kashmir &quot;Kashmirikas&quot;. Some other early references to Kashmir can also be found in Mahabharata in Sabha Parva and in puranas like Matsya Purana, Vayu Purana, Padma Purana and Vishnu Purana and Vishnudharmottara Purana.

Huientsang, the Buddhist scholar and Chinese traveller, called Kashmir &quot;kia-shi-milo&quot;, while some other Chinese accounts referred to Kashmir as &quot;ki-pin&quot; (or Chipin or Jipin) and &quot;ache-pin&quot;.

&quot;Cashmeer&quot; is an archaic spelling of modern Kashmir, and in some countries it is still spelled this way. Kashmir is called &quot;Cachemire&quot; in French, &quot;Cachemira&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Caxemira&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;Caixmir&quot; in Catalan, &quot;Casmiria&quot; in Latin, &quot;Cașmir&quot; in Romanian, and &quot;Cashmir&quot; in Occitan.

In the Kashmiri language, Kashmir itself is known as &quot;Kasheer&quot;.

===Terminology===

The Government of India and Indian sources refer to the territory under Pakistan control as &quot;Pakistan-occupied Kashmir&quot; (&quot;POK&quot;). The Government of Pakistan and Pakistani sources refer to the portion of Kashmir administered by India as &quot;Indian-occupied Kashmir&quot; (&quot;IOK&quot;) or &quot;Indian-held Kashmir&quot; (IHK); The terms &quot;Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot; and &quot;India-administered Kashmir&quot; are often used by neutral sources for the parts of the Kashmir region controlled by each country.

== History ==

In the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism. During the 7th-14th centuries, the region was ruled by a series of Hindu dynasties, and Kashmir Shaivism arose. In 1320, Rinchan Shah became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Kashmir Sultanate. The region was part of the Mughal Empire from 1586 to 1751, and thereafter, until 1820, of the Afghan Durrani Empire. 
=== Sikh rule ===
In 1819, the Kashmir Valley passed from the control of the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan to the conquering armies of the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh of the Punjab, thus ending four centuries of Muslim rule under the Mughals and the Afghan regime. As the Kashmiris had suffered under the Afghans, they initially welcomed the new Sikh rulers. However, the Sikh governors turned out to be hard taskmasters, and Sikh rule was generally considered oppressive, protected perhaps by the remoteness of Kashmir from the capital of the Sikh Empire in Lahore. The Sikhs enacted a number of anti-Muslim laws, which included handing out death sentences for cow slaughter, closing down the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, and banning the a&quot;dhan&quot;, the public Muslim call to prayer. Kashmir had also now begun to attract European visitors, several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast Muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs. High taxes, according to some contemporary accounts, had depopulated large tracts of the countryside, allowing only one-sixteenth of the cultivable land to be cultivated. Many Kashmiri peasants migrated to the plains of the Punjab. However, after a famine in 1832, the Sikhs reduced the land tax to half the produce of the land and also began to offer interest-free loans to farmers; Kashmir became the second highest revenue earner for the Sikh Empire. During this time Kashmir shawls became known worldwide, attracting many buyers, especially in the West.

The state of Jammu, which had been on the ascendant after the decline of the Mughal Empire, came under the sway of the Sikhs in 1770. Further in 1808, it was fully conquered by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Gulab Singh, then a youngster in the House of Jammu, enrolled in the Sikh troops and, by distinguishing himself in campaigns, gradually rose in power and influence. In 1822, he was anointed as the Raja of Jammu. Along with his able general Zorawar Singh Kahluria, he conquered and subdued Rajouri (1821), Kishtwar (1821), Suru valley and Kargil (1835), Ladakh (1834–1840), and Baltistan (1840), thereby surrounding the Kashmir Valley. He became a wealthy and influential noble in the Sikh court.

==Kashmir dispute==
=== Princely state ===


In 1845, the First Anglo-Sikh War broke out. According to &quot;The Imperial Gazetteer of India:&quot;

Gulab Singh contrived to hold himself aloof till the battle of Sobraon (1846), when he appeared as a useful mediator and the trusted advisor of Sir Henry Lawrence. Two treaties were concluded. By the first the State of Lahore (i.e. West Punjab) handed over to the British, as equivalent for one crore indemnity, the hill countries between the rivers Beas and Indus; by the second the British made over to Gulab Singh for 75 lakhs all the hilly or mountainous country situated to the east of the Indus and the west of the Ravi i.e. the Vale of Kashmir.

Drafted by a treaty and a bill of sale, and constituted between 1820 and 1858, the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu (as it was first called) combined disparate regions, religions, and ethnicities: to the east, Ladakh was ethnically and culturally Tibetan and its inhabitants practised Buddhism; to the south, Jammu had a mixed population of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. In the heavily populated central Kashmir valley, the population was overwhelmingly Muslim—mostly Sunni, however, there was also a small but influential Hindu minority, the brahmin Kashmiri Pandits. To the northeast, sparsely populated Baltistan had a population ethnically related to that of Ladakh, but which practised Shia Islam. To the north, also sparsely populated, Gilgit Agency was an area of diverse, mostly &quot;Shia&quot; groups, and, to the west, Punch was populated mostly by Muslims of a different ethnicity than that of the Kashmir valley. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, in which Kashmir sided with the British, and the subsequent assumption of direct rule by Great Britain, the princely state of Kashmir came under the suzerainty of the British Crown.

In the British census of India of 1941, Kashmir registered a Muslim majority population of 77%, a Hindu population of 20% and a sparse population of Buddhists and Sikhs comprising the remaining 3%. That same year, Prem Nath Bazaz, a Kashmiri Pandit journalist wrote: &quot;The poverty of the Muslim masses is appalling. ... Most are landless laborers, working as serfs for absentee [Hindu] landlords ... Almost the whole brunt of official corruption is borne by the Muslim masses.&quot; Under Hindu rule, Muslims faced hefty taxation and discrimination in the legal system, and were forced into labor without any wages. Conditions in the princely state caused a significant migration of people from the Kashmir Valley to the Punjab of British India. For almost a century, until the census, a small Hindu elite had ruled over a vast and impoverished Muslim peasantry. Driven into docility by chronic indebtedness to landlords and moneylenders, having no education besides, nor awareness of rights, the Muslim peasants had no political representation until the 1930s.

===1947 and 1948===

Ranbir Singh&#x27;s grandson Hari Singh, who had ascended the throne of Kashmir in 1925, was the reigning monarch in 1947 at the conclusion of British rule of the subcontinent and the subsequent partition of the British Indian Empire into the newly independent Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. According to Burton Stein&#x27;s &quot;History of India&quot;, Kashmir was neither as large nor as old an independent state as Hyderabad; it had been created rather off-handedly by the British after the first defeat of the Sikhs in 1846, as a reward to a former official who had sided with the British. The Himalayan kingdom was connected to India through a district of the Punjab, but its population was 77 per cent Muslim and it shared a boundary with Pakistan. Hence, it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to Pakistan when the British paramountcy ended on 14–15 August. When he hesitated to do this, Pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to Mountbatten for assistance, and the governor-general agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. The United Nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of Kashmiris must be ascertained, while India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.

In the last days of 1948, a ceasefire was agreed under UN auspices. However, since the plebiscite demanded by the UN was never conducted, relations between India and Pakistan soured, and eventually led to two more wars over Kashmir in 1965 and 1999.

===Current status and political divisions===

India has control of about half the area of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which comprises Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, while Pakistan controls a third of the region, divided into two provinces, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are administered by India as union territories. They formed a single state until 5 August 2019, when the state was bifurcated and its limited autonomy was revoked.

According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;:

Although there was a clear Muslim majority in Kashmir before the 1947 partition and its economic, cultural, and geographic contiguity with the Muslim-majority area of the Punjab (in Pakistan) could be convincingly demonstrated, the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region. Pakistan was left with territory that, although basically Muslim in character, was sparsely populated, relatively inaccessible, and economically underdeveloped. The largest Muslim group, situated in the Valley of Kashmir and estimated to number more than half the population of the entire region, lay in India-administered territory, with its former outlets via the Jhelum valley route blocked.

The eastern region of the former princely state of Kashmir is also involved in a boundary dispute that began in the late 19th century and continues into the 21st. Although some boundary agreements were signed between Great Britain, Afghanistan and Russia over the northern borders of Kashmir, China never accepted these agreements, and China&#x27;s official position has not changed following the communist revolution of 1949 that established the People&#x27;s Republic of China. By the mid-1950s the Chinese army had entered the north-east portion of Ladakh.

By 1956–57 they had completed a military road through the Aksai Chin area to provide better communication between Xinjiang and western Tibet. India&#x27;s belated discovery of this road led to border clashes between the two countries that culminated in the Sino-Indian War of October 1962.

The region is divided amongst three countries in a territorial dispute: Pakistan controls the northwest portion (Northern Areas and Kashmir), India controls the central and southern portion (Jammu and Kashmir) and Ladakh, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China controls the northeastern portion (Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract). India controls the majority of the Siachen Glacier area, including the Saltoro Ridge passes, whilst Pakistan controls the lower territory just southwest of the Saltoro Ridge. India controls of the disputed territory, Pakistan controls , and the People&#x27;s Republic of China controls the remaining .

Jammu and Azad Kashmir lie south and west of the Pir Panjal range, and are under Indian and Pakistani control respectively. These are populous regions. Gilgit-Baltistan, formerly known as the &quot;Northern Areas&quot;, is a group of territories in the extreme north, bordered by the Karakoram, the western Himalayas, the Pamir, and the Hindu Kush ranges. With its administrative centre in the town of Gilgit, the Northern Areas cover an area of and have an estimated population approaching 1 million (10 lakhs).

Ladakh is between the Kunlun mountain range in the north and the main Great Himalayas to the south. Capital towns of the region are Leh and Kargil. It is under Indian administration and was part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir until 2019. It is one of the most sparsely populated regions in the area and is mainly inhabited by people of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan descent. Aksai Chin is a vast high-altitude desert of salt that reaches altitudes up to . Geographically part of the Tibetan Plateau, Aksai Chin is referred to as the Soda Plain. The region is almost uninhabited, and has no permanent settlements.

Though these regions are in practice administered by their respective claimants, neither India nor Pakistan has formally recognised the accession of the areas claimed by the other. India claims those areas, including the area &quot;ceded&quot; to China by Pakistan in the Trans-Karakoram Tract in 1963, are a part of its territory, while Pakistan claims the entire region excluding Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract. The two countries have fought several declared wars over the territory. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 established the rough boundaries of today, with Pakistan holding roughly one-third of Kashmir, and India one-half, with a dividing line of control established by the United Nations. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 resulted in a stalemate and a UN-negotiated ceasefire.

==Geography==
The Kashmir region lies between latitudes 32° and 36° N, and longitudes 74° and 80° E. It has an area of . It is bordered to the north and east by China (Xinjiang and Tibet), to the northwest by Afghanistan (Wakhan Corridor), to the west by Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab) and to the south by India (Himachal Pradesh and Punjab).

The topography of Kashmir is mostly mountainous. It is traversed mainly by the Western Himalayas. The Himalayas terminate in the western boundary of Kashmir at Nanga Parbat. Kashmir is traversed by three rivers namely Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. These river basins divide the region into three valleys separated by high mountain ranges. The Indus valley forms the north and north-eastern portion of the region which include bare and desolate areas of Baltistan and Ladakh. The upper portion of the Jhelum valley forms the proper Vale of Kashmir surrounded by high mountain ranges. The Chenab valley forms the southern portion of the Kashmir region with its denuded hills towards the south. It includes almost all of the Jammu region. High altitude lakes are frequent at high elevations. Lower down in the Vale of Kashmir there are many freshwater lakes and large areas of swamplands which include Wular Lake, Dal Lake and Hokersar near Srinagar.
To the north and northeast, beyond the Great Himalayas, the region is traversed by the Karakoram mountains. To the northwest lies the Hindu Kush mountain range. The upper Indus River separates the Himalayas from the Karakoram. The Karakoram is the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside the polar regions. The Siachen Glacier at and the Biafo Glacier at rank as the world&#x27;s second and third longest glaciers outside the polar regions. Karakoram has four eight-thousander mountain peaks with K2, the second highest peak in the world at .
The Indus River system forms the drainage basin of the Kashmir region. The river enters the region in Ladakh at its southeastern corner from the Tibetan Plateau, and flows northwest to run a course through the entire Ladakh and Gilgit-Baltistan. Almost all the rivers originating in these region are part of the Indus river system. After reaching the end of the Great Himalayan range, the Indus turns a corner and flows southwest into the Punjab plains. The Jhelum and Chenab rivers also follow a course roughly parallel to this, and join the Indus river in southern Punjab plains in Pakistan.

The geographical features of the Kashmir region differ considerably from one part to another. The lowest part of the region consists of the plains of Jammu at the southwestern corner, which continue into the plains of Punjab at an elevation of below 1000 feet. Mountains begin at 2000 feet, then raising to 3000–4000 feet in the &quot;Outer Hills&quot;, a rugged country with ridges and long narrow valleys. Next within the tract lie the Middle Mountains which are 8000–10,000 feet in height with ramifying valleys. Adjacent to these hills are the lofty Great Himalayan ranges (14000–15000 feet) which divide the drainage of the Chenab and Jehlum from that of the Indus. Beyond this range lies a wide tract of mountainous country of 17000–22000 feet in Ladakh and Baltistan.

===Climate===

Kashmir has a different climate for every region owing to the great variation in altitude. The temperatures ranges from the tropical heat of the Punjab summer to the intensity of the cold which keeps the perpetual snow on the mountains. Jammu Division, excluding the upper parts of the Chenab Valley, features a humid subtropical climate. The Vale of Kashmir has a moderate climate. The Astore Valley and some parts of Gilgit-Baltistan features a semi-Tibetan climate. While as the other parts of Gilgit-Baltistan and Ladakh have Tibetan climate which is considered as almost rainless climate.

The southwestern Kashmir which includes much of the Jammu province and Muzaffarabad falls within the reach of Indian monsoon. The Pir Panjal Range acts as an effective barrier and blocks these monsoon tracts from reaching the main Kashmir Valley and the Himalayan slopes. These areas of the region receive much of their precipitation from the wind currents of the Arabian Sea. The Himalayan slope and the Pir Panjal witness greatest snow melting from March until June. These variations in snow melt and rainfall have led to destructive inundations of the main valley. One instance of such Kashmir flood of a larger proportion is recorded in the 12th-century book &quot;Rajatarangini&quot;. A single cloudburst in July 1935 caused the upper Jehlum river level to rise 11 feet. The 2014 Kashmir floods inundated the Kashmir city of Srinagar and submerged hundreds of other villages.

==Flora and fauna==

Kashmir has a recorded forest area of along with some national parks and reserves. The forests vary according to the climatic conditions and the altitude. Kashmir forests range from the tropical deciduous forests in the foothills of Jammu and Muzafarabad, to the temperate forests throughout the Vale of Kashmir and to the alpine grasslands and high altitude meadows in Gilgit-Baltistan and Ladakh.
The Kashmir region has four well defined zones of vegetation in the tree growth, due to the difference in elevation. The tropical forests up to 1500 m, are known as the Phulai (&quot;Acacia modesta&quot;) and Olive (Olea cuspid ata) Zone. There occur semi-deciduous species of &quot;Shorea robusta&quot;, &quot;Acacia catechu&quot;, &quot;Dalbergia sissoo&quot;, &quot;Albizia lebbeck&quot;, &quot;Garuga pinnata&quot;, &quot;Terminalia bellirica&quot; and &quot;T. tomentosa&quot; and &quot;Pinus roxburghii&quot; are found at higher elevations. The temperate zone between (1,500–3,500 m) is referred as the Chir Pine (Finns longifolia). This zone is dominated by oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.) and &quot;Rhododendron&quot; spp. The Blue Pine (Finns excelsa) Zone with &quot;Cedrus deodara&quot;, &quot;Abies pindrow&quot; and &quot;Picea smithiana&quot; occur at elevations between 2,800 and 3,500 m. The Birch (Betula utilis) Zone has Herbaceous genera of Anemone, Geranium, Iris, Lloydia, Potentilla and Primula interspersed with dry dwarf alpine scrubs of Berberis, Cotoneaster, Juniperus and Rhododendron are prevalent in alpine grasslands at 3,500 m and above.

Kashmir is referred as a beauty spot of the medicinal and herbaceous flora in the Himalayas. There are hundreds of different species of wild flowers recorded in the alpine meadows of the region. The botanical garden and the tulip gardens of Srinagar built in the Zabarwans grow 300 breeds of flora and 60 varieties of tulips respectively. The later is considered as the largest Tulip Garden of Asia.

Kashmir region is home to rare species of animals, many of which are protected by sanctuaries and reserves. The Dachigam National Park in the Valley holds the last viable population of Kashmir stag &quot;(Hangul)&quot; and the largest population of black bear in Asia. In Gilgit-Baltistan the Deosai National Park is designated to protect the largest population of Himalayan brown bears in the western Himalayas. Snow leopards are found in high density In the Hemis National Park in Ladakh. The region is home to musk deer, markhor, leopard cat, jungle cat, red fox, jackal, Himalayan wolf, serow, Himalayan yellow-throated marten, long-tailed marmot, Indian porcupine, Himalayan mouse-hare, langur and Himalayan weasel. At least 711 bird species are recorded in the valley alone with 31 classified as globally threatened species.

==Demographics==
=== Colonial era ===
In the 1901 Census of the British Indian Empire, the population of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu was 2,905,578. Of these, 2,154,695 (74.16%) were Muslims, 689,073 (23.72%) Hindus, 25,828 (0.89%) Sikhs, and 35,047 (1.21%) Buddhists (implying 935 (0.032%) others).

The Hindus were found mainly in Jammu, where they constituted a little less than 60% of the population. In the Kashmir Valley, the Hindus represented &quot;524 in every 10,000 of the population (&quot;i.e.&quot; 5.24%), and in the frontier &quot;wazarats&quot; of Ladhakh and Gilgit only 94 out of every 10,000 persons (0.94%).&quot; In the same Census of 1901, in the Kashmir Valley, the total population was recorded to be 1,157,394, of which the Muslim population was 1,083,766, or 93.6% and the Hindu population 60,641. Among the Hindus of Jammu province, who numbered 626,177 (or 90.87% of the Hindu population of the princely state), the most important castes recorded in the census were &quot;Brahmans (186,000), the Rajputs (167,000), the Khattris (48,000) and the Thakkars (93,000).&quot;

In the 1911 Census of the British Indian Empire, the total population of Kashmir and Jammu had increased to 3,158,126. Of these, 2,398,320 (75.94%) were Muslims, 696,830 (22.06%) Hindus, 31,658 (1%) Sikhs, and 36,512 (1.16%) Buddhists. In the last census of British India in 1941, the total population of Kashmir and Jammu (which as a result of the Second World War, was estimated from the 1931 census) was 3,945,000. Of these, the total Muslim population was 2,997,000 (75.97%), the Hindu population was 808,000 (20.48%), and the Sikh 55,000 (1.39%).

The Kashmiri Pandits, the only Hindus of the Kashmir valley, who had stably constituted approximately 4 to 5% of the population of the valley during Dogra rule (1846–1947), and 20% of whom had left the Kashmir valley to other parts of India in the 1950s, underwent a complete exodus in the 1990s due to the Kashmir insurgency. According to a number of authors, approximately 100,000 of the total Kashmiri Pandit population of 140,000 left the valley during that decade. Other authors have suggested a higher figure for the exodus, ranging from the entire population of over 150 thousand, to 190 thousand of a total Pandit population of 200 thousand (200,000), to a number as high as 300 thousand (300,000).


=== Modern era ===
People in Jammu speak Hindi, Punjabi and Dogri, the Kashmir Valley people speak Kashmiri, and people in the sparsely inhabited Ladakh speak Tibetan and Balti.

The population of India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh combined is 12,541,302; that of Pakistan-administered territory of Azad Kashmir is 4,045,366; and that of Gilgit-Baltistan is 1,492,924.

==Economy==
Kashmir&#x27;s economy is centred around agriculture. Traditionally the staple crop of the valley was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, Indian corn, wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its temperate climate, it is suited for crops like asparagus, artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, peaches, and cherries. The chief trees are deodar, firs and pines, chenar or plane, maple, birch and walnut, apple, cherry.

Historically, Kashmir became known worldwide when Cashmere wool was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at knitting and making Pashmina shawls, silk carpets, rugs, kurtas, and pottery. Saffron, too, is grown in Kashmir. Srinagar is known for its silver-work, papier-mâché, wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistan-administered territory of Azad Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in the India-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

===Transport===
Transport is predominantly by air or road vehicles in the region. Kashmir has a long modern railway line that started in October 2009, and was last extended in 2013 and connects Baramulla, in the western part of Kashmir, to Srinagar and Banihal. It is expected to link Kashmir to the rest of India after the construction of the railway line from Katra to Banihal is completed.

==In culture==
Irish poet Thomas Moore&#x27;s 1817 romantic poem &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; is credited with having made Kashmir (spelt &quot;Cashmere&quot; in the poem) &quot;a household term in Anglophone societies&quot;, conveying the idea that it was a kind of paradise.

<text>Kendall Square Research (KSR) was a supercomputer company headquartered originally in Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1986, near Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was co-founded by Steven Frank and Henry Burkhardt III, who had formerly helped found Data General and Encore Computer and was one of the original team that designed the PDP-8. KSR produced two models of supercomputer, the KSR1 and KSR2. It went bankrupt in 1994.

== Technology ==
The KSR systems ran a specially customized version of the OSF/1 operating system, a Unix variant, with programs compiled by a KSR-specific port of the Green Hills Software C and FORTRAN compilers. The architecture was shared memory implemented as a cache-only memory architecture or &quot;COMA&quot;. Being all cache, memory dynamically migrated and replicated in a coherent manner based on the access pattern of individual processors. The processors were arranged in a hierarchy of rings, and the operating system mediated process migration and device access. Instruction decode was hardwired, and pipelining was used. Each KSR1 processor was a custom 64-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) CPU clocked at 20 MHz and capable of a peak output of 20 million instructions per second (MIPS) and 40 million floating-point operations per second (MFLOPS). Up to 1088 of these processors could be arranged in a single system, with a minimum of eight. The KSR2 doubled the clock rate to 40 MHz and supported over 5000 processors. The KSR-1 chipset was fabricated by Sharp Corporation while the KSR-2 chipset was built by Hewlett-Packard.

=== Software ===
Besides the traditional scientific applications, KSR with Oracle Corporation, addressed the massively parallel database market for commercial applications. The KSR-1 and -2 supported Micro Focus COBOL and C/C++ programming languages, and the Oracle database and the MATISSE OODBMS from ADB, Inc. Their own product, the KSR Query Decomposer, complemented the functions of the Oracle product for SQL uses. The TUXEDO transaction monitor for OLTP was also provided. The KAP program (Kuck &amp; Associate Preprocessor) provided for pre-processing for source code analysis and parallelization. The runtime environment was termed PRESTO, and was a POSIX compliant multithreading manager.

=== Hardware ===
The KSR-1 processor was implemented as a four-chip set in 1.2 micrometer complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS). These chips were: the cell execution unit, the floating point unit, the arithmetic logic unit, and the external I/O unit (XIO). The CEU handled instruction fetch (two per clock), and all operations involving memory, such as loads and stores. 40-bit addresses were used, going to full 64-bit addresses later. The integer unit had 32, 64-bit-wide registers. The floating point unit is discussed below. The XIO had the capacity of 30 MB/s throughput to I/O devices. It included 64 control and data registers.

The KSR processor was a 2-wide VLIW, with instructions of 6 types: memory reference (load and store), execute, control flow, memory control, I/O, and inserted. Execute instructions included arithmetic, logical, and type conversion. They were usually triadic register in format. Control flow refers to branches and jumps. Branch instructions were two cycles. The programmer (or compiler) could implicitly control the &quot;quashing&quot; behavior of the subsequent two instructions that would be initiated during the branch. The choices were: always retain the results, retain results if branch test is true, or retain results if branch test is false. Memory control provided synchronization primitives. I/O instructions were provided. Inserted instructions were forced into a flow by a coprocessor. Inserted load and store were used for direct memory access (DMA) transfers. Inserted memory instructions were used to maintain cache coherency. New coprocessors could be interfaced with the inserted instruction mechanism. IEEE standard floating point arithmetic was supported. Sixty-four 64-bit wide registers were included.

The following example of KSR assembly performs an indirect procedure call to an address held in the procedure&#x27;s constant block, saving the return address in register codice_1. It also saves the frame pointer, loads integer register zero with the value 3, and increments integer register 31 without changing the condition codes. Most instructions have a delay slot of 2 cycles and the delay slots are not interlocked, so must be scheduled explicitly, else the resulting hazard means wrong values are sometimes loaded.

In the KSR design, all of the memory was treated as cache. The design called for no &quot;home&quot; location- to reduce storage overheads and to software transparently, dynamically migrate/replicate memory based on where it was utilized; a Harvard architecture, separate bus for instructions and memory was used. Each node board contained 256 KB of I-cache and D-cache, essentially primary cache. At each node was 32 MB of memory for main cache. The system level architecture was shared virtual memory, which was physically distributed in the machine. The programmer or application only saw one contiguous address space, which was spanned by a 40-bit address. Traffic between nodes traveled at up to 4 gigabytes per second. The 32 megabytes per node, in aggregate, formed the physical memory of the machine.

Specialized input/output processors could be used in the system, providing scalable I/O. A 1088 node KSR1 could have 510 I/O channels with an aggregate in excess of 15 GB/s. Interfaces such as Ethernet, FDDI, and HIPPI were supported.

== History ==
As the company scaled up quickly to enter production, they moved in the late 1980s to 170 Tracer Lane, Waltham, Massachusetts.

KSR refocused its efforts from the scientific to the commercial marketplace, with emphasis on parallel relational databases and OLTP operations. It then got out of the hardware business, but continued to market some of its data warehousing and analysis software products.

The first KSR1 system was installed in 1991. With new processor hardware, new memory hardware and a novel memory architecture, a new compiler port, a new port of a relatively new operating system, and exposed memory hazards, early systems were noted for frequent system crashes. KSR called their cache-only memory architecture (COMA) by the trade name &quot;Allcache&quot;; reliability problems with early systems earned it the nickname &quot;Allcrash&quot;, although memory was not necessarily the root cause of crashes. A few KSR1 models were sold, and as the KSR2 was being rolled out, the company collapsed amid accounting irregularities involving the overstatement of revenue.

KSR used a proprietary processor because 64-bit processors were not commercially available. However, this put the small company in the difficult position of doing both processor design and system design. The KSR processors were introduced in 1991 at 20 MHz and 40 MFlops. At that time, the 32-bit Intel 80486 ran at 50 MHz and 50 MFlops. When the 64-bit DEC Alpha was introduced in 1992, it ran at up to 192 MHz and 192 MFlops, while the 1992 KSR2 ran at 40 MHz and 80 MFlops.

One customer of the KSR2, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a United States Department of Energy facility, purchased an enormous number of spare parts, and kept their machines running for years after the demise of KSR.

KSR, along with many of its competitors (see below), went bankrupt during the collapse of the supercomputer market in the early 1990s. KSR went out of business in February 1994, when their stock was delisted from the stock exchange.

In April of 1996, the SEC filed a complaint against the company and several officers (Burkhardt III, the CEO and President; Peter Appleton Jones, the highest-ranked sales executive; and Karl G Wassman III, the CFO and CAO) for issuing materially false and misleading financial statements for six quarters in 1992 and 1993. These individuals and Thomas J MacCormack, director of contracts administration, were also accused of selling KSR stock while in possession of material nonpublic information. While no one admitted or denied wrongdoing, all individuals settled. All were ordered to pay disgorgements representing losses avoided as well as fines and interest accrued. Burkhardt paid some $1.1 million; MacCormack over $31,000. Though Wassman was ordered to pay in excess of $200,000, and Appleton Jones in excess of $300,000, they had spent their illicit gains in the meanwhile and all fines but $40,000 each were waived &quot;on demonstrated inability to pay a greater amount.&quot;

== Competition ==
KSR&#x27;s competitors included MasPar Computer Corporation, Thinking Machines, Meiko Scientific, and various old-line (and still surviving) companies like IBM and Intel.

<text>Kinglassie (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Cill Ghlaise&quot;) is a small village and parish in central Fife, Scotland. It is located two miles southwest of Glenrothes. It has a population of around ()
The civil parish has a population of 22,543 (in 2011).

==History==
The village of Kinglassie (properly pronounced Kin-glassie, but locals have said King-lassie for decades) lies to the north of the Lochty Burn, southwest of Glenrothes in Fife, and two miles southeast of Perth and Kinross district. 
The name of the village derives from Scottish Gaelic, although the exact meaning is obscure. The name was first recorded as &quot;Kilglassin&quot; in 1127. The first element, kil, is from the Gaelic, &quot;cill&quot;, meaning monk&#x27;s cell or church, but was changed to kin or &quot;ceann&quot;, meaning head or end, by the 13th century. The element &#x27;glassie&#x27; may refer to the Irish saint Glaisne, or may be glasin, meaning the place of the burn. Taken together this gives &quot;St Glaisne&#x27;s Church&quot; or &quot;Church of the Burn&quot; as possible meanings.

Little of antiquity remains, except for the Dogton Stone, with its Celtic cross, situated in a field about a mile (1.5 km) to the south. For many years, Kinglassie was a weaving village, but in the 19th and 20th centuries it developed as a mining town.

From a very early period through to the Reformation, Scotland was dotted over with certain divisions of lands known as &quot;Schyres.&quot; Thus, in the immediate neighbourhood of Kinross were &quot;Kynros-Schyre&quot;, &quot;Portmocke-Schyre&quot;, &quot;Kinglassy-Schyre&quot;, &quot;Muchard-Schyre&quot;, and &quot;Doloure-Schyre&quot;. These Schyres must not be confused with the shire of the present day; they were simply divisions of land, similar in extent to an average modern parish.

Kinglassie has a primary school, Mitchell Hall (1896) and the Miners&#x27; Welfare Institute (est. 1931). Fife Airport lies about a mile (1.5 km) to the north and, on a hill overlooking the farm of Redwells, stands Blythe&#x27;s Folly, a tower built in 1812 by an eccentric Leith ship owner. Kinglassie&#x27;s development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries was marked by its rapid expansion to house mine workers. Many mine workers perished or were injured during the life of the mine. The mine was plagued by water flooding problems. The Kinglassie Pit started in 1908 and closed in 1967. The Westfield open cast coal mine lies to the west of the village and is still regarded as the biggest man-made hole in Europe by local people.

Glastian of Kinglassie B (AC) (also known as Glastian of MacGlastian) was born in Fife, Scotland. He died at Kinglassie (Kinglace), Scotland, in 830. As bishop of Fife, Saint Glastian mediated in the bloody civil war between the Picts and the Scots. When the Picts were subjugated, Glastian did much to alleviate their lot. He is the patron saint of Kinglassie in Fife and is venerated in Kyntire (Benedictines, Husenbeth).

==School==
Kinglassie Primary School has a roll of approximately 270 pupils. The school was built to designs by the architect George Charles Campbell in 1912. It has a butterfly type plan consisting of two single storey rendered wings either side of a hexagon shaped hall. The central portion of the façade is two storeys high and of red sandstone, with generous steps leading to a central formal entrance. It is a category B listed building.

The Pupil Council represents pupils in the school. The eco-committee consists of pupils, staff, parents, and members of the wider community, and is proactive in promoting conservation initiatives throughout the school. A parent council represents the parent body and raises funds for various initiatives. In addition, children are supported in class by a growing number of parent helpers and the school is well-supported by parents generally.

==Local landmarks==
Blythe&#x27;s Tower, built in 1812, is a four-storey square tower, high, built of rubble with ashlar string courses and a crenellated parapet. It is a category B listed building. The tower&#x27;s interior was formerly floored to afford access to an observation platform. The tower was built by a linen merchant to view ships as they entered the Forth, affording him the opportunity to procure the best goods at port. During World War II, the tower was used as a look out tower by the home guard.
The Dogton Stone, lies in a field to the south of Kinglassie at Grid reference – NT 236 968. The stone is a fragment of a free standing cross erected by the Picts, it probably dates from the 9th Century. The lower portion of the stone is all that remains of the cross and badly eroded decoration including a figure of an armed horseman above two beasts can be discerned. No one is certain why the stone was erected at this spot. It is a scheduled monument.

The Mitchell Hall, built in 1896, was donated to the community by Alexander Mitchell. Mitchell also donated the first Parish Church organ. The Mitchell Hall is used by local community groups and is an asset to the wider Fife community.

<text>Kalāt or Qalāt (Brahui/Balochi: قلات), historically known as Qīqān, is a historic town located in Kalat District, in Pakistan&#x27;s Balochistan province. The town of Kalat is the headquarter of Kalat District and is known locally as Kalat-e-Brahui and Kalat-e-Sewa.

Qalat, formerly Qilat, is located roughly in the center of the Balochistan province, It was the capital of the Kalat Khanate. The Khan of Kalat is presently a ceremonial title held by Mir Suleman Dawood Jan, and the Pakistan government has made efforts to reconcile with him; his son, Prince Mohammed, who is next in line to be the Khan of Kalat, is pro-Pakistan.

==History==
 The town of Kalat is said to have been founded by and named Qalat-e Sewa (Sewa&#x27;s Fort), after Sewa, a legendary hero of the then-Hindu Brahui people. 
Six battles of Kikan (Six battles of Kikanan/Kizkanan): The legendary battles of Kinan parallel the battle of Thermopylae, where a small contingent of pastoral Jat warriors defeated a massive Muslim army. Despite facing a vastly superior Muslim military in numbers, training, and weaponry, Jats inflicted a crushing defeat on Arabic invaders, a humiliation so profound it was taken personally by the Muslim Caliph. Chach Nama reports that during the Arab Muslim invasion of Sindh, the mountain-dwelling brave and agile Jats of Kikan or Kikanan or Kizkanan, likely present-day Kalat, near Bolan Pass in Balochistan summarily defeated invading Arabic Muslim forces of Haras and killed Haras in 662 CE, only a small portion of Muslim forces returned to Umayyad Caliphate. The impact of Muslim defeat was so significant that for next 20 years each successive caliph made Kikan a special target for attack and sent 6 expeditions of which 5 &quot;failed miserably&quot; and &quot;failed to make any permanent impression&quot; in Sindh. 

The Brahui Speaking tribes arrived from east in the Qalat area way before the arrival of Balochi speaking tribes from the west. The Brohis established a large kingdom in the 15th century, but it soon declined and the region fell to Mughals for a short period. The brahui speaking Khans of Qalat were dominant from the 17th century onwards until the arrival of the British in the 19th century. A treaty was signed in 1876 to make Qalat part of the British Empire.

In 1947, the Khan of Kalat reportedly acceded to the dominion of Pakistan. 
In 1948, Qalat became part of Pakistan when the British withdrew. The last Khan of Qalat was formally removed from power in 1955, but the title is still claimed by his descendants. The current Khan of Qalat is Mir Suleman Dawood Khan Ahmadzai.

==Climate==
Kalat features a cold desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. The average temperature in Kalat is , while the annual precipitation averages . June is the driest month with of rainfall, while January, the wettest month, has an average precipitation of .

July is the warmest month of the year with an average temperature of . The coldest month January has an average temperature of . The all-time lowest recorded temperature in Kalat was on 20 January 1978, while the highest temperature ever recorded was on 19 June 1977.

== Demographics ==
The population is mostly Muslim (97 percent), with a Hindu population of three percent, out of which many are Hindkowan merchants who regard Kalat as their homeland.

==Kalat Kali Temple==
There is a Hindu temple devoted to Kali. On 21 December 2010, the 82 year old chief-priest was abducted in what was reported as part of increasingly routine targeting of minority Hindus in the province.

<text>The Kordofanian languages are a geographic grouping of five language groups spoken in the Nuba Mountains of the South Kordofan region of Sudan: Talodi–Heiban languages, Lafofa languages, Rashad languages, Katla languages and Kadu languages. The first four groups are sometimes regarded as branches of the hypothetical Niger–Congo family, whereas Kadu is now widely seen as a branch of the proposed Nilo-Saharan family.

== History ==
In 1963, Joseph Greenberg added them to the Niger–Congo family, creating his Niger–Kordofanian proposal. The Kordofanian languages have not been shown to be more distantly related than other branches of Niger–Congo, however, and they have not been shown to constitute a valid group. Today, the Kadu languages are excluded, and the others are usually included in Niger–Congo proper.

Roger Blench notes that the Talodi and Heiban families have the noun class systems characteristic of the Atlantic–Congo core of Niger–Congo but that the two Katla languages have no trace of ever having had such a system. However, the Kadu languages and some of the Rashad languages appear to have acquired noun classes as part of a Sprachbund rather than having inherited them. Blench concludes that Talodi and Heiban are core Niger–Congo whereas Katla and Rashad form a peripheral branch along the lines of Mande.

Heiban, Katloid, and Talodi are also grouped together in an automated computational analysis (ASJP 4) by Müller et al. (2013). However, since the analysis was automatically generated, the grouping could be either due to mutual lexical borrowing or genetic inheritance.

== Talodi–Heiban languages ==

The Heiban languages, also called Koalib or Koalib–Moro, and the Talodi languages, also called Talodi–Masakin, are part of the Talodi–Heiban group.

== Lafofa languages ==

Lafofa (Tegem) was for a time classified with Talodi, but appears to be a separate branch of Niger–Congo.

== Rashad languages ==

The number of Rashad languages, also called Tegali–Tagoi, varies among descriptions, from two (Williamson &amp; Blench 2000), three (Ethnologue), to eight (Blench &quot;ms&quot;). Tagoi has a noun-class system like the Atlantic–Congo languages, which is apparently borrowed, but Tegali does not.

== Katla languages ==

The two Katla languages have no trace of ever having had a Niger–Congo-type noun-class system.

== Kadu languages ==

Since the work of Thilo C. Schadeberg in 1981, the &quot;Tumtum&quot; or Kadu branch is now widely seen as Nilo-Saharan.

==Reconstruction==
Quint (2020) suggests that Proto-Kordofanian can be reconstructed from the Heibanian, Talodian, Rashadian, Katloid, and Lafofa languages. His Proto-Kordofanian reconstructions are as follows:

===Lexical isoglosses===
Starostin (2018) lists the following common lexical isoglosses in the Kordofanian languages. Potential cognates are highlighted in bold.

<text>The Khuriya Muriya Islands (also &quot;Kuria Muria&quot;, &quot;Kooria Mooria&quot;, &quot;Curia Muria&quot;) (; transliterated: &quot;Juzur Khurīyā Murīyā&quot; or &quot;Khūryān Mūryān)&quot; are a group of five islands in the Arabian Sea, off the southeastern coast of Oman. The islands form part of the province of Shalim and the Hallaniyat Islands in the governorate of Dhofar.

==History==
In antiquity the islands were called the &quot;Zenobii&quot; or &quot;Zenobiou Islands&quot; (; &quot;&quot;) or &quot;Doliche&quot; (). The islands were mentioned by several early writers including Ptolemy (vi. 7. § 47) who numbered them as seven small islands lying in Khuriya Muriya Bay (; ), towards the entrance of the &quot;Persian Gulf&quot; (most likely the modern Gulf of Aden). The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a periplus dated to between AD 40 and 70, thus mentioned the Khuriya Muriya Islands, then called &quot;Isles of Zenobios&quot;:
=== Modern history ===

In 1854 the sultan of Muscat (later Muscat and Oman, now Oman) presented the islands to Queen Victoria as a gift and responsibility for the islands was granted to the Bombay government in British India. There was some concern at the time that the deed of cession was null since the sultan had no rights over the archipelago. The Red Sea and India Telegraph Company, formed in 1858, intended to use one of the islands as a base for a telegraph connection between Aden and Karachi but the project was abandoned in 1861 after sections of the cable failed. A group of Liverpool entrepreneurs were granted monopoly rights to harvest the abundant guano deposits, but after having met resistance from the local inhabitants who considered that resource theirs, and questions in the British parliament about the advisability of granting monopoly rights to anyone, the mining was abandoned after some 200,000 tons had been extracted between 1855 and 1860. During that period, the archipelago presented a busy scene, with up to 52 ships present on one occasion. As per a British intelligence report from 1883, fewer than 40 inhabitants lived on Al-Hallaniyah, the main island. The islanders lived in huts of unmortared stone with mat roofs, and at certain seasons they moved to caves. They lived on fish, shellfish and goat&#x27;s milk, occasionally exchanging dried fish for dates and rice from passing ships. They fished entirely with hooks since they had neither boat nor nets.

==== Yemeni control ====
In 1886, the islands were attached administratively to Aden. Due to their remoteness, the lack of anchorages and the fact that the inhabitants continued to consider themselves subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, the islands remained un-administered and, for decades, were only sporadically visited by British officials. While technically part of Aden Colony, the islands, because of their remoteness and inaccessibly, were left to the supervision of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. As a British possession until 1967, they were administered by the Governor of Aden until 1953, then by the British High Commissioner until 1963, and finally by the British Chief Political Resident of the Persian Gulf (based in Bahrain). On 30 November 1967, Lord Caradon, the British Ambassador to the United Nations, announced that in accordance with the wishes of the local inhabitants, the islands would be returned to Muscat and Oman, despite criticism from President Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi that the islands should be transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of South Yemen. The boundary between the two countries was not formally settled until 1992 when it was agreed that the islands were on Oman&#x27;s side of the line.

==Important Bird Area==
The island group has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports seabird breeding colonies of red-billed tropicbirds, tropical shearwaters, masked boobies, Socotra cormorants, sooty gulls, and bridled and greater crested terns. Other significant birds are resident mourning wheatears and visiting Jouanin&#x27;s petrels.

==Biography==

=== Family background ===
Abbas belonged to the Ansari family of Panipat, tracing its roots back to Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a close companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and among the famed personalities that it produced we find: the 12th century Sufi saint Abdullah Ansari of Herat in Afghanistan; his maternal great-grandfather Altaf Hussain Hali, a student of Mirza Ghalib and himself an Urdu poet of repute; his paternal grandfather Khwaja Ghulam Abbas, one of the chief rebels of the 1857 Rebellion movement, and the first martyr of Panipat to be blown from the mouth of a cannon; his father Ghulam-us-Sibtain, among the first graduates from Aligarh Muslim University, who was a tutor of a prince and a businessman who modernised the preparation of Unani medicines; Abbas&#x27;s mother, Masroora Khatoon, was the daughter of Khwaja Sajjad Husain, an educator keen on female education, having established the first school for girls in Panipat.

=== Early life and education ===
Abbas was born in Panipat, undivided Punjab. He attended Hali Muslim High School, which was established by his maternal grandfather, Hali. He was instructed to read the Arabic text of the Quran and matriculated at the age of fifteen.

He gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1933 and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1935 from Aligarh Muslim University.

=== Illness and death ===
Abbas suffered from a heart attack in the 60s, followed by another more serious heart attack, a paralytic stroke as well a on set accident injuring his legs, but he kept working till his death at the age of 72 on 1 June 1987.

== Career ==

=== Journalism ===
After leaving university,K.A Abbas began his career as a journalist at the &quot;National Call&quot;, a New Delhi-based newspaper. Later while studying law in 1934, started &quot;Aligarh Opinion&quot;.

He joined &quot;The Bombay Chronicle&quot; in 1935 as a political correspondent and later, became a film critic for the newspaper.

He entered films as a part-time publicist for Bombay Talkies in 1936, a production house owned by Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, to whom he sold his first screenplay &quot;Naya Sansar&quot; (1941).

While at &quot;The Bombay Chronicle&quot; (1935–1947), he started a weekly column called &#x27;Last Page&#x27;, which he continued when he joined the Blitz magazine. &quot;The Last Page&quot;, (&#x27;Azad Kalam&#x27; in the Urdu edition) became the longest-running political column in India&#x27;s history (1935–87). A collection of these columns was later published as two books. He continued to write for The Blitz and Mirror until his last days.

Abbas interviewed several renowned personalities in literary and non-literary fields, including the Russian Prime Minister Khrushchov, American President Roosevelt, Charlie Chaplin, Mao-Tse-Tung and Yuri Gagarin.

=== Cinema ===
Meanwhile, he had started writing scripts for other directors, for Chetan Anand and for V. Shantaram.

In 1945, he made his directorial debut with a film based on the Bengal famine of 1943, (&quot;Children of the Earth&quot;), for the Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association (IPTA). In 1951, he founded his own production company called Naya Sansar, which consistently produced films that were socially relevant including, &quot;Anhonee&quot;, &quot;Munna&quot;, &quot;Rahi&quot; (1953), based on a Mulk Raj Anand story, was on the plight of workers on tea plantations, the National Film Award winner, &quot;Shehar Aur Sapna&quot; (1964) and &quot;Saat Hindustani&quot; (1969), which won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration and is also remembered as Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s debut film.
He wrote the story and screenplay for the controversial themed film in 1974 &quot;Call Girl&quot; directed by Vijay Kapoor, starring Vikram and Zahera.

He went on to write scripts for &quot;Jagte Raho&quot; and prominent Raj Kapoor films including &quot;Awaara, Shri 420, Mera Naam Joker, Bobby&quot; and &quot;Henna&quot;.

=== Literature ===
Abbas wrote 74 books in English, Hindi and Urdu and was considered the leading light of the Urdu short story. His best known fictional work remains &#x27;Inquilab&#x27;, which made him a household name in Indian literature. Like Inquilab, many of his works were translated into many Indian and foreign languages, like Russian, German, Italian, French and Arabic.

His autobiography, &quot;I Am not an Island: An Experiment in Autobiography&quot;, was published in 1977 and again in 2010.

=== Censorship case ===
In 1968, Abbas made a documentary film called &quot;Char Shaher Ek Kahani&quot; (A Tale of Four Cities). The film depicted the contrast between the luxurious life of the rich in the four cities of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Delhi and that of the squalor and poverty of the poor. He approached the Central Board of Film Certification to obtain a &#x27;U&#x27; (Unrestricted Public Exhibition) certificate. Abbas was, however, informed by the regional office of the Board that the film was not eligible to be granted a &#x27;U&#x27; certificate, but was suitable for exhibition only for adults. His appeal to the revising committee of the Central Board of Film Certification led to the decision of the censors being upheld.

Khwaja Ahmad Abbas further appealed to the Central Government but the government decided to grant the film a &#x27;U&#x27; certificate provided certain scenes were cut. Following this, Abbas approached the Supreme Court of India by filing a writ petition under Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution. He claimed that his fundamental right of free speech and expression was denied by the Central Government&#x27;s refusal to grant the film a &#x27;U&#x27; certificate. Abbas also challenged the constitutional validity of pre-censorship on films.

However the Supreme Court of India upheld the constitutional validity of pre-censorship on films.

<text>Katherine Anne MacLean (January 22, 1925 – September 1, 2019) was an American science fiction author best known for her short fiction of the 1950s which examined the impact of technological advances on individuals and society.

==Profile==
Damon Knight wrote, &quot;As a science fiction writer she has few peers; her work is not only technically brilliant but has a rare human warmth and richness.&quot; Brian Aldiss noted that she could &quot;do the hard stuff magnificently,&quot; while Theodore Sturgeon observed that she &quot;generally starts from a base of hard science, or rationalizes psi phenomena with beautifully finished logic.&quot;

According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, she &quot;was in the vanguard of those sf writers trying to apply to the soft sciences the machinery of the hard sciences&quot;.

Her stories have been included in anthologies and a few have had radio and television adaptations. Three collections of her stories have been published.

It was while she worked as a laboratory technician in 1947 that she began writing science fiction. Strongly influenced by Ludwig von Bertalanffy&#x27;s General Systems Theory, her fiction has often demonstrated foresight about scientific advances.

She died on September 1, 2019, at the age of 94.

==Awards==
MacLean received a Nebula Award in 1971 for her novella &quot;The Missing Man&quot; (&quot;Analog&quot;, March, 1971) and she was a Professional Guest of Honor at the first WisCon in 1977. She was honored in 2003 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as an SFWA Author Emeritus. In 2011, she received the Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award.

==Collections==
&quot;The Diploids and Other Flights of Fancy&quot; (Avon, 1962), her first short story collection, includes &quot;The Diploids&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Six Fingers&quot;), &quot;Feedback&quot;, &quot;Pictures Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, &quot;Incommunicado&quot;, &quot;The Snow Ball Effect&quot;, &quot;Defense Mechanism&quot; and &quot;And Be Merry&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Pyramid in the Desert&quot;).

Her second collection, &quot;The Trouble with You Earth People&quot; (Donning/Starblaze, 1980) contains &quot;The Trouble with You Earth People&quot;, &quot;The Gambling Hell and the Sinful Girl&quot;, &quot;Syndrome Johnny&quot;, &quot;Trouble with Treaties&quot; (with Tom Condit), &quot;The Origin of the Species&quot;, &quot;Collision Orbit&quot;, &quot;The Fittest&quot;, &quot;These Truths&quot;, &quot;Contagion&quot;, &quot;Brain Wipe&quot; and her Nebula Award-winning &quot;The Missing Man&quot;.

==Short stories and novelettes==
* &quot;Defense Mechanism&quot; (1949). This tale of hidden telepathic abilities was Katherine MacLean&#x27;s first story to see print when it was published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (October, 1949).
* &quot;And Be Merry&quot; (1950). Originally in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (February, 1950), this story was first anthologized in Groff Conklin&#x27;s &quot;Omnibus of Science Fiction&quot; (Crown, 1952) and has also been published under the title &quot;The Pyramid in the Desert.&quot; In January 2006, MacLean reflected on the science behind the story:
::&quot;And Be Merry&quot; (Eat Drink and Be Merry for Tomorrow We Die) A lab biologist, female, takes advantage of her husband going off on an archeology trip, to use the privacy to experiment on herself for rejuvenation by a severe and dangerous method. Succeeding, she contemplates immortality, finding that safety from accidental death has become so valuable to her that she becomes a coward, cowering from all possible risk, seeing shelter in a hospital, and is only rescued from mindless panic by her husband finding her, realizing the source of her terror and rescuing her from immortality by claiming she has a slow growing tumor in an unreachable part of the body.

::Finding she has no chance of evading eventual death, she immediately loses her obsession with safety, becomes interested in biochemistry again, and invents a new theory. (New at the time.) Mutation from background radiation does not just strike the sperm and egg making chromosome changes in the embryo and mutated progeny, it also strikes the chromosomes in each cell of any living creature, damages and mutates them also, and produces cancer. This cannot be prevented. She called it &quot;somatic mutation&quot; and used the new concept of body deterioration by slow radiation damage (age) to underpin her rediscovered recklessness, and be happy.

::Even now most biotechs have not fully accepted the implication that every cell in the body can generate an entire copy of the person. But perhaps a copy will be changed and mutated for the worse by exposure to ambient radiation and other mutagens. Perhaps a cell needs to generate a placenta around it to develop into an entire body. Something like that is holding up the biochemists from successfully making copies of individuals from body or blood cells. Not for long! I wrote three more stories with novel genetic ideas before 1953. Some have not been followed up by scientists yet.

* &quot;Incommunicado&quot; (1950). In this novelette about communication and computers, written by MacLean in 1947, she demonstrated an ability to foresee the future evolution of personal computers. Passages in this story anticipate such latter-day digital configurations as Google Book Search, Google Video Search, PDA devices, podcasting and portable music players. At a space station operated by a computer, the station&#x27;s workers begin to unconsciously develop a musical rapport with their computer in a feedback loop. When published in the June 1950 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, cover artist Miller contributed one of the more striking &quot;Astounding&quot; covers of the 1950s, blending an emotional musical performance with cyber technology. The story was reprinted a decade later in Groff Conklin&#x27;s anthology, &quot;Six Great Short Science Fiction Novels&quot; (Dell, 1960), followed by MacLean&#x27;s collection, &quot;The Diploids&quot; (Avon, 1962). In January, 2006, MacLean recalled this incident, trying to gate-crash a convention of electronic engineers a few years after &quot;Incommunicado&quot; was published in 1950:
::In the 1930s and 1940s, scientists and boys planning to be scientists read &quot;Astounding&quot; (&quot;Analog&quot;) with close attention to the hottest most promising ideas and took them up as soon as they could get funded lab space. They did not openly express their gratitude to science fiction, because the funding depended on keeping claim to have originated the ideas they had put so much work into testing and verifying...

::&quot;I hastily looked around for a door to a lecture hall where I could sneak some listening time and get a line on current research, and be out of sight before the desk was reoccupied by the guardian of the gate...

::Too late, a man built like a fullback in a business suit was bearing down on me. &quot;I see you don&#x27;t have your badge. May I have your name? I&#x27;ll look it up in the registry...&quot;

::&quot;Katherine MacLean, I came in because I am interested in--&quot;

::He interrupted. &quot;Katherine MacLean! Are you that Katherine MacLean?&quot; He gripped my hand and hung on. Who was that Katherine Maclean? Was I being mistaken for someone else?

::&quot;Are you the Katherine MacLean who wrote &#x27;Incommunicado&#x27;?&quot;

::Speechless with relief, I nodded. I would not be arrested or thrown out if they would accept me as a science fiction writer. He kept his grip on my hand and turned around and bellowed to his group of chatting friends, &quot;Guess who I&#x27;ve got here. The little woman who wrote &#x27;Incommunicado&#x27;!&quot;

::...I had not been aware that my playing with communication ideas would attract the attention of prestigious Bell Telephone researchers. I had left radio and wavelength theory to my Dad as one of his hobbies and learned early that I could get a nasty shock from playing with his wiring. I could not account for their enthusiasm. I went back to the typewriter and lost myself in the story again.

::The point is, that scientists not only read &quot;Astounding-Analog&quot;, they were fans of the writers and understood all the Ideas, even the obscure Ideas that were merely hinted at.

* &quot;Contagion&quot; (1950). Originally published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; (October 1950), reprinted in &quot;Women of Wonder&quot; (1975).

* &quot;Feedback&quot; (1951). A sociological setback occurs when conformity becomes a closed circle, prompting even more conformity; a teacher who speaks in favor of individuality is regarded as subversive. Originally in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (July, 1951).
* &quot;Syndrome Johnny&quot; (1951). Published before it was even certain that DNA carried genetic information, this story is about a series of engineered retroviral plagues, initially propagated by blood transfusion, that are genetically re-engineering the human race. First published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; (July, 1951).
* &quot;Pictures Don&#x27;t Lie&#x27;&quot; (1951). Radio contact with extraterrestrial ship arriving on Earth. Originally in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; (August, 1951), it was adapted to radio, television and comic books. The adaptation on the UK series &quot;Out of This World&quot; was telecast August 11, 1962. The EC Comics version of this story was &quot;Chewed Out!&quot;, illustrated by Joe Orlando for &quot;Weird Science&quot; 12 (March–April 1952). In expanding the basic premise and adding comedic elements, scripter Al Feldstein established the setting as Blytheville, Arkansas. On several occasions MacLean noted that she ranked EC&#x27;s interpretation as superior to her own story.
* &quot;The Man Who Staked the Stars&quot; (1952, as Charles Dye). A business mobster under investigation is slowly turned against himself by an internal doppelgänger. Originally in &quot;Planet Stories&quot; (July, 1952). This story is available online free in Project Gutenberg.
* &quot;The Snowball Effect&quot; (1952). A sociology professor, challenged to prove his theories of the dynamic growth of organizations, rewrites the rules of a smalltown sewing circle to have &quot;more growth drive than the Roman Empire.&quot; He is far more successful than he ever anticipated. Originally in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; (September, 1952), and adapted for the X Minus One radio series in 1956.
* &quot;Games&quot; (1953). A boy becomes the characters in his make-believe games. Originally in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; (March, 1953). Available online
* &quot;The Diploids&quot; (1953). In this novella, a young lawyer suspects he may be an alien because of certain physical and biochemical abnormalities but discovers that he is a commercial human embryonic cell line, sold for research and illegally grown to maturity. Originally in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; (April, 1953). Also titled &quot;Six Fingers.&quot;
* &quot;Cosmic Checkmate&quot; (1958). This collaboration by MacLean and Charles V. De Vet, published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (March, 1958), was nominated for a 1959 Hugo. It was expanded as &quot;Second Game&quot; in 1962 and again in 1981. Two gamers play a multi-level game to determine whether Earth&#x27;s civilization wins.
* &quot;Unhuman Sacrifice&quot; (1958). Published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (November, 1958), reprinted in Damon Knight&#x27;s anthology &quot;A Century of Science Fiction&quot; (1962). The attempts of a missionary to spread the word on an alien planet are frustrated by the aliens&#x27; life cycle.

* &quot;Interbalance&quot; (1960). Published in &quot;Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; (October 1960).

* &quot;The Kidnapping of Baroness 5&quot; (1995) Originally published in &quot;Analog&quot;; republished in the anthologies &quot;Women of Other Worlds&quot; (edited by Helen Merrick &amp; Tess Williams) and &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Liberation&quot; (edited by Connie Willis and Sheila Williams). In a post-apocalyptic world, a geneticist struggles to help preserve and lengthen the lives of the genetically damaged descendants of the survivors of a genetic experiment to extend the human lifespan that went horribly wrong. Instead, with each generation, lifespan gets shorter, and as less and less knowledge is passed down to each succeeding generation, society has regressed to a feudal state. She fits into society by casting herself as a sort of &quot;good witch&quot; cum healer, passing off her medical expertise and her efforts to correct the damage to the human aging process as magic.

==Novels==
* &quot;The Man in the Bird Cage&quot; (1971)
* &quot;Missing Man&quot; (1975). In a balkanized New York City, an engineer working for the city&#x27;s disaster planning section has his inside knowledge exploited to cause disasters. The novel is a fix-up of MacLean&#x27;s three Rescue Squad stories, including the 1971 Nebula Award-winning novella of the same name. 
* &quot;Dark Wing&quot; (1979) with husband Carl West. In a world where medical knowledge has been outlawed, a young man discovers a medical kit, remnant of times past, which he uses to help those around him and to fight his way towards a better understanding of science and medicine.

<doc id="17355" wikidata="Q105480" url="?curid=17355" title="Kenneth Kaunda">
<text>Kenneth Kaunda (28 April 1924 – 17 June 2021), also known as KK, was a Zambian politician who served as the first president of Zambia from 1964 to 1991. He was at the forefront of the struggle for independence from British rule. Dissatisfied with Harry Nkumbula&#x27;s leadership of the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress, he broke away and founded the Zambian African National Congress, later becoming the head of the socialist United National Independence Party (UNIP).

Kaunda was the first president of independent Zambia. In 1973, following tribal and inter-party violence, all political parties except UNIP were banned through an amendment of the constitution after the signing of the Choma Declaration. At the same time, Kaunda oversaw the acquisition of majority stakes in key foreign-owned companies. The 1973 oil crisis and a slump in export revenues put Zambia in a state of economic crisis. Western pressure forced Kaunda to change the rules that had kept him in power. Multi-party elections took place in 1991, in which Frederick Chiluba, the leader of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy, ousted Kaunda.

He was briefly stripped of Zambian citizenship in 1998, but the decision was overturned two years later in 2000.

==Early life==
Kenneth Kaunda was born on 28 April 1924 at Lubwa Mission in Chinsali, then part of Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, and was the youngest of eight children. His father, the Reverend David Kaunda, was an ordained Church of Scotland missionary and teacher, who had been born in Nyasaland (now Malawi) and had moved to Chinsali, to work at Lubwa Mission. His mother was also a teacher and was the first African woman to teach in colonial Northern Rhodesia. They were both teachers among the Bemba ethnic group which is located in northern Zambia. His father died when Kenneth was a child. This is where Kenneth Kaunda received his education until the early 1940s. He later on followed in his parents&#x27; footsteps and became a teacher; first in Northern Rhodesia but then in the middle of the 1940s he moved to Tanganyika Territory (now part of Tanzania). He also worked in Southern Rhodesia. He attended Munali Training Centre in Lusaka between 1941 and 1943. Early in his career, he read the writings of Mahatma Gandhi that he said: &quot;went straight to my heart.&quot;

Kaunda was a teacher at the Upper Primary School and Boarding Master at Lubwa and then Headmaster at Lubwa from 1943 to 1945. For a time, he worked at the Salisbury and Bindura Mine. In early 1948, he became a teacher in Mufulira for the United Missions to the Copperbelt (UMCB). He was then assistant at an African Welfare Centre and Boarding Master of a Mine School in Mufulira. In this period, he was leading a Pathfinder Scout Group and was Choirmaster at a Church of Central Africa congregation. He was also Vice-Secretary of the Nchanga Branch of Congress.

==Independence struggle and presidency==

In 1949 Kaunda entered politics and became the founding member of the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress. On 11 November 1953 he moved to Lusaka to take up the post of Secretary General of the Africa National Congress (ANC), under the presidency of Harry Nkumbula. The combined efforts of Kaunda and Nkumbula failed to mobilise native African peoples against the European-dominated Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1955 Kaunda and Nkumbula were imprisoned for two months with hard labour for distributing subversive literature. The two leaders drifted apart as Nkumbula became increasingly influenced by white liberals and failing to defend indigenous Africans, Kaunda led a dissident group to Nkumbula that eventually broke with the ANC and founded his own party, the Zambian African National Congress (ZANC) in October 1958. ZANC was banned in March 1959 and in Kaunda was sentenced to nine months&#x27; imprisonment, which he spent first in Lusaka, then in Salisbury.

While Kaunda was in prison, Mainza Chona and other nationalists broke away from the ANC and, in October 1959, Chona became the first president of the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the successor to ZANC. However, Chona did not see himself as the party&#x27;s main founder. When Kaunda was released from prison in January 1960 he was elected president of UNIP. In 1960 he visited Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta and afterwards, in July 1961, Kaunda organised a civil disobedience campaign in Northern Province, the so-called Cha-cha-cha campaign, which consisted largely of arson and obstructing significant roads. Kaunda subsequently ran as a UNIP candidate during the 1962 elections. This resulted in a UNIP–ANC Coalition government, with Kaunda as Minister of Local Government and Social Welfare. In January 1964, UNIP won the next major elections, defeating their ANC rivals and securing Kaunda&#x27;s position as prime minister. On 24 October 1964 he became the first president of an independent Zambia, appointing Reuben Kamanga as his vice-president.

===Educational policies===

At the time of its independence, Zambia&#x27;s modernisation process was far from complete. The nation&#x27;s educational system was one of the most poorly developed in all of Britain&#x27;s former colonies, and it had just a hundred university graduates and no more than 6,000 indigenous inhabitants with two years or more of secondary education. Because of this, Zambia had to invest heavily in education at all levels. Kaunda instituted a policy where all children, irrespective of their parents&#x27; ability to pay, were given free exercise books, pens, and pencils. The parents&#x27; main responsibility was to buy uniforms, pay a token &quot;school fee&quot; and ensure that the children attended school. This approach meant that the best pupils were promoted to achieve their best results, all the way from primary school to university level. Not every child could go to secondary school, for example, but those who did were well educated.

The University of Zambia was opened in Lusaka in 1966, after Zambians all over the country had been encouraged to donate whatever they could afford towards its construction. Kaunda was appointed Chancellor and officiated at the first graduation ceremony in 1969. The main campus was situated on the Great East Road, while the medical campus was located at Ridgeway near the University Teaching Hospital. In 1979 another campus was established at the Zambia Institute of Technology in Kitwe. In 1988 the Kitwe campus was upgraded and renamed the Copperbelt University, offering business studies, industrial studies and environmental studies.
Other tertiary-level institutions established during Kaunda&#x27;s era were vocationally focused and fell under the aegis of the Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training. They include the Evelyn Hone College and the Natural Resources Development College (both in Lusaka), the Northern Technical College at Ndola, the Livingstone Trades Training Institute in Livingstone, and teacher-training colleges.

===Economic policies===

Kaunda&#x27;s newly independent government inherited a country with one of the most vibrant economies in sub-Saharan Africa, largely on account of its rich mineral deposits, albeit one that was largely under the control of foreign and multinational interests.
For example, the British South Africa Company (BSAC, founded by Cecil Rhodes) still retained commercial assets and mineral rights that it had acquired from a concession signed with the Litunga of Bulozi in 1890. Only by threatening to expropriate it on the eve of independence did Kaunda manage to get favourable concessions from the BSAC.

His ineptness at economic management blighted his country&#x27;s development after independence. Despite having some of the finest farming land in Africa, Kaunda adopted the same socialist agricultural policies as Tanzania, with disastrous results.

Deciding on a planned economy, Zambia instituted a programme of national development, under the direction of the National Commission for Development Planning, which instituted a &quot;Transitional Development Plan&quot; and the &quot;First National Development Plan&quot;. The two operations brought major investment in the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors. In April 1968, Kaunda initiated the Mulungushi Reforms, which sought to bring Zambia&#x27;s foreign-owned corporations under national control under the Industrial Development Corporation. Over the subsequent years, a number of mining corporations were nationalised, although the country&#x27;s banks, such as Barclays and Standard Chartered, remained foreign-owned. The Zambian economy suffered a setback from 1973, when rising oil prices and falling copper prices combined to reduce the state&#x27;s income from the nationalised mines. The country fell into debt with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Third National Development Plan had to be abandoned as crisis management replaced long-term planning. His weak attempts at economic reforms in the 1980s hastened Zambia&#x27;s decline. A number of negotiations with the IMF followed, and by 1990 Kaunda was forced into partial privatisation of the state-owned corporations. The country&#x27;s economic woes ultimately contributed to his fall from power.

===One-party state and &quot;African socialism&quot;===
In 1964, shortly before independence, violence broke out between supporters of the Lumpa Church, led by Alice Lenshina. Kaunda temporarily banned the church and ordered Lumpa&#x27;s arrest.
From 1964 onwards, Kaunda&#x27;s government developed authoritarian characteristics. Becoming increasingly intolerant of opposition, Kaunda banned all parties except UNIP following violence during the 1968 elections. However, in early 1972, he faced a new threat in the form of Simon Kapwepwe&#x27;s decision to leave UNIP and found a rival party, the United Progressive Party, which Kaunda immediately attempted to suppress. Next, he appointed the Chona Commission, which was set up under the chairmanship of Mainza Chona in February 1972. Chona&#x27;s task was to make recommendations for a new Zambian constitution which would effectively reduce the nation to a one-party state. The commission&#x27;s terms of reference did not permit it to discuss the possible faults of Kaunda&#x27;s decision, but instead to concentrate on the practical details of the move to a one-party state. Finally, Kaunda neutralised Nkumbula by getting him to join UNIP and accept the Choma Declaration on 27 June 1973. The new constitution was formally promulgated on 25 August of that year. At the first elections under the new system held that December, Kaunda was the sole candidate.

With all opposition having been eliminated, Kaunda allowed the creation of a personality cult. He developed a left nationalist-socialist ideology, called Zambian Humanism. This was based on a combination of mid-20th-century ideas of central planning/state control and what he considered basic African values: mutual aid, trust, and loyalty to the community. Similar forms of African socialism were introduced inter alia in Ghana by Kwame Nkrumah (&quot;Consciencism&quot;) and Tanzania by Julius Nyerere (&quot;Ujamaa&quot;). To elaborate on his ideology, Kaunda published several books: &quot;Humanism in Zambia and a Guide to its Implementation, Parts 1, 2 and 3&quot;. Other publications on Zambian Humanism are: &quot;Fundamentals of Zambian Humanism&quot;, by Timothy Kandeke; &quot;Zambian Humanism, religion and social morality&quot;, by Rev. Fr. Cleve Dillion-Malone, S.J., and &quot;Zambian Humanism: some major spiritual and economic challenges&quot;, by Justin B. Zulu. &quot;Kaunda on Violence&quot; (US title, &quot;The Riddle of Violence&quot;) was published in 1980.

As president of UNIP, and under the country&#x27;s one-party state system, Kaunda was the only candidate for president of the republic in the general elections of 1978, 1983, and 1988, each time with official results showing over 80 per cent of voters approving his candidacy. Parliamentary elections were also controlled by Kaunda. In the 1978 UNIP elections, Kaunda amended the party&#x27;s constitution to bring in rules that invalidated the challengers&#x27; nominations: Kapwepwe was told he could not stand because only people who had been members for five years could be nominated to the presidency (he had only rejoined UNIP three years before); Nkumbula and a third contender, businessman Robert Chiluwe, were outmanoeuvred by introducing a new rule that said each candidate needed the signatures of 200 delegates from &quot;each&quot; province to back their candidacy.

===Foreign policy===

During his early presidency Kaunda was an outspoken supporter of the anti-apartheid movement and opposed white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia. Kaunda supported the succession of Biafra when he recognized it as an independent nation on May 20, 1968. Although his nationalisation of the copper mining industry in the late 1960s and the volatility of international copper prices contributed to increased economic problems, matters were aggravated by his logistical support for the black nationalist movements in Ian Smith&#x27;s Rhodesia, South West Africa, Angola, and Mozambique. Kaunda&#x27;s administration later attempted to serve the role of a mediator between the entrenched white minority and colonial governments and the various guerrilla movements which were aimed at overthrowing these respective administrations. Beginning in the early 1970s, he began permitting the most prominent guerrilla organisations, such as the Rhodesian ZANU and the African National Congress, to use Zambia as a base for their operations. Former ANC president Oliver Tambo even spent a significant proportion of his 30-year exile living and working in Zambia. Joshua Nkomo, leader of ZAPU, also erected military encampments there, as did SWAPO and its military wing, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia.In the first twenty years of Kaunda&#x27;s presidency, he and his advisors sought numerous times to acquire modern weapons from the United States. In a letter written to US president Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967, Kaunda inquired if the United States would provide him with long-range missile systems. This request for modern weapons even included missiles with nuclear warheads. All of his requests for modern weapons were refused by the United States. In 1980, Kaunda purchased sixteen MiG-21 jets from the Soviet Union, which ultimately provoked a reaction from the United States. Kaunda responded to the United States, stating that after numerous failed attempts to purchase weapons, buying from the Soviets was justified in his duty to protect his citizens and Zambian national security. His attempted purchase of modern American weapons may have been a political tactic to use fear to establish his one-party rule over Zambia.

From April 1975, when he visited US president Gerald Ford at the White House in Washington, D.C., and delivered a powerful speech calling for the United States to play a more active and constructive role in southern Africa. Until approximately 1984, Kaunda was arguably the key African leader involved in international diplomacy regarding the conflicts in Angola, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and Namibia. He hosted Henry Kissinger&#x27;s 1976 trip to Zambia, got along very well with Jimmy Carter, and worked closely with President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Chester Crocker. While there were disagreements between Kaunda and US leaders (such as when Zambia purchased Soviet MiG fighters or when he accused two American diplomats of being spies), Kaunda generally enjoyed a positive relationship with the United States during these years.

On 26 August 1975, Kaunda acted as mediator along with the Prime Minister of South Africa, B. J. Vorster, at the Victoria Falls Conference to discuss possibilities for an internal settlement in Southern Rhodesia with Ian Smith and the black nationalists. After the Lancaster House Agreement, Kaunda attempted to seek similar majority rule in South West Africa. He met with P. W. Botha in Botswana in 1982 to debate this proposal, but apparently failed to make a serious impression.

Meanwhile, the anti-white minority insurgency conflicts of southern Africa continued to place a huge economic burden on Zambia as white minority governments were the country&#x27;s main trading partners. In response, Kaunda negotiated the TAZARA Railway (Tanzam) linking Kapiri Mposhi in the Zambian Copperbelt with Tanzania&#x27;s port of Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean. Completed in 1975, this was the only route for bulk trade which did not have to transit white-dominated territories. This precarious situation lasted more than 20 years, until the abolition of apartheid in South Africa.

For much of the Cold War, Kaunda was a strong supporter of the Non-Aligned Movement. He hosted a NAM summit in Lusaka in 1970 and served as the movement&#x27;s chairman from 1970 to 1973. He maintained a close friendship with Yugoslavia&#x27;s long-time leader Josip Broz Tito; he was remembered by many Yugoslav officials for weeping openly over Tito&#x27;s casket in 1980. He also visited and welcomed Romania&#x27;s president, Nicolae Ceaușescu, in the 1970s. In 1986, the University of Belgrade, Yugoslavia, awarded him an honorary doctorate.

Kaunda had frequent but cordial differences with US president Ronald Reagan whom he met 1983 and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher mainly over what he saw as a blind eye being turned towards South African apartheid. He always maintained warm relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China who had provided assistance on many projects in Zambia, including the Tazara Railway.

Prior to the first Gulf War, Kaunda cultivated a friendship with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, whom he claimed to have attempted to dissuade from invading Kuwait. A street in Lusaka was named in Saddam&#x27;s honour, although the name was later changed when both leaders had left power.

In August 1989, Farzad Bazoft was detained in Iraq for alleged espionage. He was accompanied by a British nurse, Daphne Parish, who was also arrested. Bazoft was later tried, convicted, and executed, but Kaunda managed to negotiate for his female companion&#x27;s release.

Kaunda served as chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) from 1970 to 1971 and again from 1987 to 1988.

==Fall from power==
Matters quickly came to a head in 1990. In July, amid three days of rioting in the capital, Kaunda announced a referendum on whether to legalise other parties would be held that October. However, he argued for maintaining UNIP&#x27;s monopoly, claiming that a multiparty system would lead to chaos. The announcement almost came too late; hours later, a disgruntled officer went on the radio to announce Kaunda had been overthrown. The coup attempt was broken three to four hours later, but it was clear Kaunda and the UNIP were reeling. Kaunda tried to mollify the opposition by moving the referendum to August 1991; the opposition claimed the original date did not allow enough time for voter registration.

While expressing willingness to have the Zambian people vote on a multiparty system, Kaunda maintained that only a one-party state could prevent tribalism and violence from engulfing the country. By September, however, opposition demands forced Kaunda to reverse course. He cancelled the referendum, and instead recommended constitutional amendments that would dismantle UNIP&#x27;s monopoly on power. He also announced a snap general election for the following year, two years before it was due. He signed the necessary amendments into law in December.

At these elections, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), helmed by trade union leader Frederick Chiluba, swept UNIP from power in a landslide. In the presidential election, Kaunda was roundly defeated, taking only 24 per cent of the vote to Chiluba&#x27;s 75 per cent. UNIP was cut down to only 25 seats in the National Assembly. One of the issues in the campaign was a plan by Kaunda to turn over one-quarter of the nation&#x27;s land to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an Indian guru who promised that he would use it for a network of utopian agricultural enclaves that proponents said would create &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot;. Kaunda was forced in a television interview to deny practising Transcendental Meditation. When Kaunda handed power to Chiluba on 2 November 1991, he became the second mainland African head of state to allow free multiparty elections and to relinquish power peacefully after he had lost. The first, Mathieu Kérékou of Benin, had done so in March of that year.

==Post-presidency==
After leaving office, Kaunda clashed frequently with Chiluba&#x27;s government and the MMD. Chiluba later attempted to deport Kaunda on the grounds that he was a Malawian. The MMD-dominated government under the leadership of Chiluba had the constitution amended, barring citizens with foreign parentage from standing for the presidency, to prevent Kaunda from contesting the next elections in 1996, in which he planned to participate. After the 1997 coup attempt, on Boxing Day in 1997 he was arrested by paramilitary policemen. However, many officials in the region appealed against this; on New Year&#x27;s Eve of the same year, he was placed under house arrest until his court date. In 1999 Kaunda was declared stateless by the Ndola High Court in a judgment delivered by Justice Chalendo Sakala. Kaunda however successfully challenged this decision in the Supreme Court of Zambia, which declared him to be a Zambian citizen in the &quot;Lewanika and Others vs. Chiluba&quot; ruling.

On 4 June 1998, Kaunda announced that he was resigning as United National Independence Party leader and retiring from politics. After retiring in 2000, he was involved in various charitable organisations. His most notable contribution was his zeal in the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS. One of Kaunda&#x27;s children was claimed by the pandemic in the 1980s. From 2002 to 2004, he was an &quot;African President-in-Residence&quot; at the African Presidential Archives and Research Center at Boston University.

In September 2019, Kaunda said that it was regrettable that the late president Robert Mugabe was maligned and subjected to mudslinging by some sections of the world, who were against his crusade of bringing social justice and equity to Zimbabwe.

== Personal life and death ==
Kaunda married Betty Banda in 1946, with whom he had eight children. She died on 19 September 2013 aged 87, while visiting one of their daughters in Harare, Zimbabwe.

He also wrote music about the independence he hoped to achieve, although only one song has been known to many Zambians (&quot;Tiyende pamodzi ndi mtima umo&quot; literally meaning &quot;Let&#x27;s walk together with one heart&quot;).

On 14 June 2021, Kaunda was admitted to Maina Soko Military Hospital in Lusaka to be treated for an undisclosed medical condition. The Zambian government said medics were doing everything they could to make him recover, though it was not clear what his health condition was. On 15 June 2021, it was revealed that he was being treated for pneumonia, which according to his doctor, had been a recurring problem in his health. On 17 June 2021 it was confirmed that he died at the age of 97 after a short illness at Maina Soko Military Hospital. He was survived by 30 grandchildren and eleven great-grandchildren.

Kaunda attributed his longevity to a strict lacto-vegetarian diet and commented that &quot;I don&#x27;t take meat, no eggs, no chicken, I only eat vegetables like an elephant&quot;. He also avoided alcohol and gave up drinking tea in 1953.

President Edgar Lungu announced on his Facebook page that Zambia will observe 21 days of national mourning. On 21 June, Vice-President Inonge Wina announced that Kaunda&#x27;s remains would be taken on a funeral procession around the country&#x27;s provinces, with church services in each provincial capital, prior to a state funeral at National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka on 2 July and interment at the Presidential Burial Site on 7 July.

Several other nations also announced periods of state mourning. Zimbabwe declared fourteen days of mourning; South Africa declared ten days of mourning; Botswana, Malawi, Namibia and Tanzania all declared seven days of mourning; Mozambique declared six days of mourning; South Sudan declared three days of mourning; Cuba declared one day of mourning. President of Singapore Halimah Yacob offered her condolences to the politicians and people of Zambia for Kaunda&#x27;s death.

<text>K2, at above sea level, is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest at . It lies in the Karakoram range, partially in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and partially in the China-administered Trans-Karakoram Tract in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.

K2 became known as the &quot;Savage Mountain&quot; after George Bell—a climber on the 1953 American expedition—said, &quot;It&#x27;s a savage mountain that tries to kill you.&quot; Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 has long been the deadliest: prior to 2021, approximately one person had died on the mountain for every four who reached the summit. After an increase in successful attempts, , an estimated 800 people have summited K2, with 96 deaths during attempted climbs.

Also occasionally known as Mount Godwin-Austen, other nicknames for K2 are &quot;The King of Mountains&quot; and &quot;The Mountaineers&#x27; Mountain&quot;, as well as &quot;The Mountain of Mountains&quot; after prominent Italian climber Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same. Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb. This is due in part to its more northern location, where inclement weather is more common. The summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni on a 1954 Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio.

Most ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year. In January 2021 K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter by a team of Nepalese climbers led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.

K2&#x27;s eastern face remains un-climbed.

== Name ==

The name &quot;K2&quot; is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India. Thomas Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram from Mount Haramukh, some to the south, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labeling them &quot;K1&quot; and &quot;K2&quot;, where the &quot;K&quot; stands for &quot;Karakoram&quot;.

The policy of the Great Trigonometrical Survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possible and K1 was found to be known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name-- possibly due to its remoteness. The mountain is not visible from Askole, one of the highest settlements on the way to the mountain, nor from the nearest habitation to the north. K2 is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured. The name &quot;Chogori&quot;, derived from two Balti words, &quot;chhogo&quot; ཆོ་གྷའོ་ (&quot;big&quot;) and &quot;ri&quot; རི (&quot;mountain&quot;) (چھوغوری) has been suggested as a local name, but evidence for its widespread use is scant. It may have been a compound name invented by Western explorers or simply a bemused reply to the question &quot;What&#x27;s that called?&quot; It does, however, form the basis for the name &quot;Qogir&quot; () by which Chinese authorities officially refer to the peak. Other local names have been suggested including &quot;Lamba Pahar&quot; (&quot;Tall Mountain&quot; in Urdu) and &quot;Dapsang&quot;, but these are not widely used.

With the mountain lacking a local name, the name &quot;Mount Godwin-Austen&quot; was suggested in honour of Henry Godwin-Austen, an early explorer of the area. While the name was rejected by the Royal Geographical Society, it was used on several maps and continues to be used occasionally.

The surveyor&#x27;s mark, K2, therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known. It is now also used in the Balti language, rendered as &quot;Kechu&quot; or &quot;Ketu&quot; (, ). The Italian climber Fosco Maraini argued in his account of the ascent of Gasherbrum IV that while the name of K2 owes its origin to chance, its clipped, impersonal nature is highly appropriate for such a remote and challenging mountain. He concluded that it was:

André Weil named K3 surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain K2.

==Geographical setting==
K2 lies in the northwestern Karakoram Range. It is located in the Baltistan region of Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan, and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang, China. The Tarim sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the Lesser Himalayas on the south. Melt waters from glaciers, such as those south and east of K2, feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh-water supply.

K2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain&#x27;s independent stature. It is a part of the same extended area of uplift (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas) as Mount Everest, and it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower than , at the Kora La on the Nepal/China border in the Mustang Lo. Many other peaks far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense. It is, however, the most prominent peak within the Karakoram range.

K2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height. It stands over above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over of vertical relief in less than .

A 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain on Earth. A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.

==Height==
K2&#x27;s height given on maps and encyclopedias is . In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named &quot;K2 60 Years Later&quot;, was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation. The height of K2 measured during this expedition was .

==Geology==
The mountains of K2 and Broad Peak, and the area westward to the lower reaches of Sarpo Laggo glacier, consist of metamorphic rocks, known as the &quot;K2 Gneiss&quot; and part of the Karakoram Metamorphic Complex. The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite-rich paragneiss. On the south and southeast face of K2, the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar orthogneiss, which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes. In places, the paragneisses include clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing psammites, garnet (grossular)-diopside marbles, and biotite-graphite phyllites. Near the memorial to the climbers who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists, called the &quot;Gilkey-Puchoz sequence&quot;, are interbanded within the orthogneisses. On the west face of Broad Peak and the south spur of K2, lamprophyre dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss. The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.

40Ar/39Ar ages of 115 to 120 million years ago obtained from and geochemical analyses of the K2 Gneiss demonstrate that it is an older, metamorphosed, pre-collisional Cretaceous granite. The granitic precursor (protolith) to the K2 Gneiss originated as the result of the production of large bodies of magma by a northward-dipping subduction zone along what was the continental margin of Asia at that time and their intrusion as batholiths into its lower continental crust. During the initial collision of the Asia and Indian plates, this granitic batholith was buried to depths of about or more, highly metamorphosed, highly deformed, and partially remelted during the Eocene Period to form gneiss. Later, the K2 Gneiss was then intruded by leucogranite dikes and finally exhumed and uplifted along major breakback thrust faults during post-Miocene time. The K2 Gneiss was exposed as the entire K2-Broad Peak-Gasherbrum range experienced rapid uplift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace.

==Climbing history==
===Early attempts===
The mountain was first surveyed by a British team in 1856. Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain &quot;K2&quot; for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II, and Gasherbrum I, respectively. In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached &quot;Concordia&quot; on the Baltoro Glacier.

The first serious attempt to climb K2 was undertaken in 1902 by Oscar Eckenstein, Aleister Crowley, Jules Jacot-Guillarmod, Heinrich Pfannl, Victor Wessely, and Guy Knowles via the Northeast Ridge. In the early 1900s, modern transportation did not exist in the region: it took &quot;fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain&quot;.
After five serious and costly attempts, the team reached —although considering the difficulty of the challenge, and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics, Crowley&#x27;s statement that &quot;neither man nor beast was injured&quot; highlights the relative skill of the ascent. The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions—of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather.

The next expedition to K2, in 1909, led by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, reached an elevation of around on the South East Spur, now known as the &quot;Abruzzi Spur&quot; (or Abruzzi Ridge). This would eventually become part of the standard route, but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty. After trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the West Ridge or the North East Ridge, the Duke declared that K2 would never be climbed, and the team switched its attention to Chogolisa, where the Duke came within of the summit before being driven back by a storm.
The next attempt on K2 was not made until 1938, when the First American Karakoram expedition, led by Charles Houston, made a reconnaissance of the mountain. They concluded that the Abruzzi Spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather.

The following year, the 1939 American expedition led by Fritz Wiessner came within of the summit but ended in disaster when Dudley Wolfe, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar, and Pintso disappeared high on the mountain.

Charles Houston returned to K2 to lead the 1953 American expedition. The attempt failed after a storm pinned down the team for 10 days at , during which time climber Art Gilkey became critically ill. A desperate retreat followed, during which Pete Schoening saved almost the entire team during a mass fall (known simply as The Belay), and Gilkey was killed, either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burdening his companions. Despite the retreat and tragic end, the expedition has been given iconic status in mountaineering history. The Gilkey Memorial was built in his memory at the mountain&#x27;s foot.

===Success and repeats===

The 1954 Italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 via the Abruzzi Spur on 31 July 1954. The expedition was led by Ardito Desio, and the two climbers who reached the summit were Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. The team included a Pakistani member, Colonel Muhammad Ata-ullah, who had been a part of the 1953 American expedition. Also on the expedition were Walter Bonatti and Pakistani Hunza porter Amir Mehdi, who both proved vital to the expedition&#x27;s success in that they carried oxygen tanks to for Lacedelli and Compagnoni. The ascent is controversial because Lacedelli and Compagnoni established their camp at a higher elevation than originally agreed with Mehdi and Bonatti. It being too dark to ascend or descend, Mehdi and Bonatti were forced to overnight without shelter above , leaving the oxygen tanks behind as requested when they descended. Bonatti and Mehdi survived, but Mehdi was hospitalised for months and had to have his toes amputated because of frostbite. Efforts in the 1950s to suppress these facts to protect Lacedelli and Compagnoni&#x27;s reputations as Italian national heroes were later brought to light. It was also revealed that the moving of the camp was deliberate, apparently because Compagnoni feared being outshone by the younger Bonatti. Bonatti was given the blame for Mehdi&#x27;s hospitalisation.

On 9 August 1977, 23 years after the Italian expedition, Ichiro Yoshizawa led the second successful ascent, with Ashraf Aman as the first native Pakistani climber. The Japanese expedition took the Abruzzi Spur and used more than 1,500 porters.

The third ascent of K2 was in 1978, via a new route, the long and corniced Northeast Ridge. The top of the route traversed left across the East Face to avoid a vertical headwall and joined the uppermost part of the Abruzzi route. This ascent was made by an American team, led by James Whittaker; the summit party was Louis Reichardt, Jim Wickwire, John Roskelley, and Rick Ridgeway. Wickwire endured an overnight bivouac about below the summit, one of the highest bivouacs in history. This ascent was emotional for the American team, as they saw themselves as completing a task that had been begun by the 1938 team forty years earlier.

Another notable Japanese ascent was that of the difficult North Ridge on the Chinese side of the peak in 1982. A team from the led by Isao Shinkai and put three members, Naoe Sakashita, Hiroshi Yoshino, and Yukihiro Yanagisawa, on the summit on 14 August. However Yanagisawa fell and died on the descent. Four other members of the team achieved the summit the next day.

The first climber to reach the summit of K2 twice was Czech climber Josef Rakoncaj. Rakoncaj was a member of the 1983 Italian expedition led by Francesco Santon, which made the second successful ascent of the North Ridge (31 July 1983). Three years later, on 5 July 1986, he reached the summit via the Abruzzi Spur (double with Broad Peak West Face solo) as a member of Agostino da Polenza&#x27;s international expedition.

The first woman to summit K2 was Polish climber Wanda Rutkiewicz on 23 June 1986. Liliane and Maurice Barrard, who had summited later that day, fell during the descent; Liliane Barrard&#x27;s body was found on 19 July 1986 at the foot of the south face. On July 28, 2024, Japanese climber Naoko Watanabe became the first woman to summit K2 three times.

In 1986, two Polish expeditions summited via two new routes, the Magic Line and the Polish Line (Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski). Piotrowski fell to his death as the two were descending.

Thirteen climbers from several expeditions died in the 1986 K2 disaster. Another six mountaineers died in the 1995 K2 disaster, while eleven climbers died in the 2008 K2 disaster.

===Recent records, attempts and notable events===
;2004
:In 2004, the Spanish climber Carlos Soria Fontán became the oldest person ever to summit K2, at the age of 65.
;2008
: On 1 August 2008, a group of climbers went missing after a large piece of ice fell during an avalanche, taking out the fixed ropes on part of the route; four climbers were rescued, but 11, including Meherban Karim from Pakistan and Ger McDonnell, the first Irish person to reach the summit, were confirmed dead.
;2009
: Despite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.
;2010
: On 6 August 2010, Fredrik Ericsson, who intended to ski from the summit, joined Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner on the way to the summit of K2. Ericsson fell and was killed. Kaltenbrunner aborted her summit attempt.
:Despite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.
;2011
: On 23 August 2011, a team of four climbers reached the summit of K2 from the North side. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to complete all 14 eight-thousanders without supplemental oxygen. Kazakhs Maxut Zhumayev and Vassiliy Pivtsov completed their eight-thousanders quest. The fourth team member was Dariusz Załuski from Poland.
;2012
: The year started with a Russian team aiming for a first winter ascent. This expedition ended with the death of Vitaly Gorelik due to frostbite and pneumonia. The Russian team cancelled the ascent. In the summer season, K2 saw a record crowd standing on its summit—28 climbers in a single day—bringing the total for the year to 30.
;2014
: On 26 July 2014, the first team of Pakistani climbers scaled K2. There were six Pakistani and three Italian climbers in the expedition, called K2 60 Years Later, according to BBC. Previously, K2 had only been summited by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions. Another team, consisting of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2.
:On 27 July 2014, Garrett Madison led a team of three American climbers and six Sherpas to summit K2. On this day, Alan Arnette became the oldest American to summit the mountain at the age of 58. On 31 July 2014, Boyan Petrov completed the first Bulgarian ascent, just 8 days after climbing Broad Peak.
;2017
: On 28 July 2017, Vanessa O&#x27;Brien led an international team of 12 with Mingma Gyalje Sherpa of Dreamers Destination to the summit of K2 and became the first British and American woman to summit K2, and the eldest woman to summit K2 at the age of 52 years old. She paid tribute to Julie Tullis and Alison Hargreaves, two British women who summited K2, in 1986 and 1995 respectively, but died during their descents. Other notable summits included John Snorri Sigurjónsson and Dawa Gyalje Sherpa who joined his sister (Dawa Yangzum Sherpa), becoming the second set of siblings to summit K2. Both Mingma Gyalje Sherpa and Fazal Ali recorded their second K2 summits.
;2018
:2018 became the record year for highest number of summits in a season, at 62.
:On 22 July 2018, Garrett Madison became the first American climber to reach the summit of K2 more than once when he led an international team of eight climbers, nine Nepali Sherpas, four Pakistani high-altitude porters, and two other Madison Mountaineering guides to the summit.
:On 22 July 2018, Polish mountaineer and mountain runner Andrzej Bargiel became the first person to ski from summit to base camp.
;2019
:On 25 July 2019, Anja Blacha became the first German woman to summit K2. She climbed without the use of supplemental oxygen.
;2022
:On 22 July 2022, 145 summits on K2 were recorded in a single day, making it a record for the highest number of summits in a single day ever on K2. The 2022 season also saw the highest number of summits in a season at 200, taking over the previous record of 62 summits in 2018.
:On 28 July 2022, Adriana Brownlee became the youngest woman to climb K2 when she summited at age 21.
;2023
:2023 was also a busy season like 2022, with an estimated 112 summits on the only viable weather window of July 27. Norwegian mountaineer Kristin Harila and her guide, Nepali mountaineer Tenjen Sherpa successfully completed their summit of K2 on the same day, and set a record for the fastest climb of all 14 eight-thousanders in 92 days.

===Winter expeditions===
* 1987/1988 — Polish-Canadian-British expedition led by Andrzej Zawada from the Pakistani side, consisting of 13 Poles, 7 Canadians and 4 Brits. 2 March Krzysztof Wielicki and Leszek Cichy established camp III at above sea, followed by Roger Mear and Jean-Francois Gagnon few days later. Hurricane winds and frostbite forced the team to retreat.
* 2002/2003 — Netia K2 Polish Winter Expedition. The team of fourteen climbers was led by Krzysztof Wielicki, and included four members from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Georgia. They intended to climb North Ridge. Marcin Kaczkan, Piotr Morawski and Denis Urubko established camp IV at above sea level. The final ascent started by Kaczkan and Urubko failed due to the destruction of the tent by harsh weather in camp IV and Kaczkan&#x27;s cerebral edema.
* 2011/2012 — Russian expedition. Nine Russian climbers attempted K2&#x27;s Abruzzi Spur route. They managed to reach above sea level (Vitaly Gorelik, Valery Shamalo, and Nicholas Totmyanin) but had to retreat due to hurricane-force winds as well as frostbite on both of Gorelik&#x27;s hands. After their descent to base camp and an unsuccessful call for Gorelik&#x27;s evacuation (helicopter could not reach them through the worsening weather), the climber died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest. Following the incident, the expedition was called off.
* 2017/2018 — Polish National Winter Expedition led by Krzysztof Wielicki, consisting of 13 climbers, started in the end of December 2017. The team initially attempted to summit via the south-southeastern spur (Cesen route), switching to the Abruzzi Spur after an injury on the previous route. Via the Cesen/Basque route they reached up to , while on the Abruzzi Spur route they reached up to . However, Denis Urubko reported that during his solo attempt he probably reached up to . 
* 2021 — Ten climbers made the first winter summit on 16 January 2021. The group summited together, and consisted of Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, Nirmal Purja, Gelje Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Dawa Temba Sherpa, Pem Chhiri Sherpa, Kilu Pemba Sherpa, Dawa Tenjing Sherpa, and Sona Sherpa. The summiting group consisted entirely of indigenous climbers from Nepal. Nirmal Purja was the only one who reached the summit without the use of supplemental oxygen. The summit temperature was . On the same day, Spanish climber Sergi Mingote died on the descent from Camp III; he fell somewhere between Camp I and Advanced Base Camp. Four other climbers would die during the 2020–21 winter season: Atanas Skatov, Ali Sadpara, John Snorri, and Juan Pablo Mohr Prieto.

==Climbing routes and difficulties==

K2 features several routes, each with distinct characteristics; however, they all share common challenges. The first is the extreme altitude, which results in a significant reduction in available oxygen. At the summit of K2, only one-third of the oxygen present at sea level is available to climbers. The second challenge is the mountain’s tendency to experience extreme storms lasting several days, which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak. The third is the steep, exposed, and demanding nature of all routes on the mountain, which makes retreat particularly difficult, especially during storms. Despite numerous attempts, the first successful winter ascent occurred only in 2021. All major climbing routes are located on the Pakistani side. The base camp is also located on the Pakistani side.

===Abruzzi Spur===

The standard route of ascent, used by 75% of all climbers, is the Abruzzi Spur, located on the Pakistani side, first attempted by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in 1909. This is the peak&#x27;s southeast ridge, rising above the Godwin-Austen Glacier. The spur proper begins at an altitude of , where Advanced Base Camp is usually placed. The route follows an alternating series of rock ribs, snow/ice fields, and some technical rock climbing on two famous features, &quot;House&#x27;s Chimney&quot; and the &quot;Black Pyramid.&quot; Above the Black Pyramid, the route continues along dangerously exposed and difficult-to-navigate slopes leading to the easily visible &quot;Shoulder&quot; and then on to the summit. The last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the &quot;Bottleneck&quot;, which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit. It was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers reached the summit in 2002 and 2003.

Between 1 and 2 August 2008, 11 climbers from several expeditions died during a series of accidents, including several icefalls in the Bottleneck.

===North Ridge===

Almost opposite the Abruzzi Spur is the North Ridge, which ascends the Chinese side of the peak. It is rarely climbed, partly due to very difficult access, involving crossing the Shaksgam River, which is a hazardous undertaking. In contrast to the crowds of climbers and trekkers at the Abruzzi basecamp, usually at most two teams are encamped below the North Ridge. This route, more technically difficult than the Abruzzi, ascends a long, steep, primarily rock ridge to high on the mountain—Camp IV, the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; at —and then crosses a dangerously slide-prone hanging glacier by a leftward climbing traverse, to reach a snow couloir which accesses the summit.

Besides the original Japanese ascent, a notable ascent of the North Ridge was the one in 1990 by Greg Child, Greg Mortimer, and Steve Swenson, which was done alpine style above Camp 2, though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a Japanese team.

===Other routes===
Because 75% of people who climb K2 use the Abruzzi Spur, these listed routes are rarely climbed. No one has climbed the East Face of the mountain due to the instability of the snow and ice formations on that side. In addition to the East Face, the North Face has not yet been climbed either. In 2007, Denis Urubko and Serguey Samoilov intended to climb the K2&#x27;s North Face but they were stymied by increasingly deteriorating conditions. After finding their intended route menaced by growing avalanche danger, they traversed onto the normal North Ridge route and summited on 2 October 2007, making the latest summer season ascent of the peak in history.

;Northeast Ridge: Long and marked with the presence of multiple ice cornices, this ridge finishes on the uppermost part of Abruzzi route. First crossed by a Polish expedition led by Janusz Kurczab in 1976. The team was not able to summit due to poor weather. First climbed by Louis Reichardt and James Wickwire on 6 September 1978.

; West Ridge: First climbed in 1981 by a Japanese team. This route starts on the distant Negrotto Glacier and goes through unpredictable bands of rock and snowfields.

; Southwest Pillar or &quot;Magic Line&quot;: Very technical, and the second most demanding. First climbed in 1986 by the Polish-Slovak trio Piasecki-Wróż-Božik. Since then Jordi Corominas from Spain has been the only successful climber on this route (he summited in 2004), despite many other attempts.

; South Face or &quot;Polish Line&quot; or &quot;Central Rib&quot;: Extremely exposed, demanding, and dangerous. In July 1986, Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski summited on this route. Piotrowski was killed while descending on the Abruzzi Spur. The route starts off the first part of the Southwest Pillar and then deviates into a totally exposed, snow-covered cliff area, then through a gully known as &quot;the Hockey Stick&quot;, and then up to yet another exposed cliff face, continuing through yet another extremely exposed section all the way up to the point where the route joins with the Abruzzi Spur about before the summit. Reinhold Messner called it a suicidal route and so far, no one has repeated Kukuczka and Piotrowski&#x27;s achievement. &quot;The route is so avalanche-prone, that no one else has ever considered a new attempt.&quot;

; Northwest Face: First ascent via this route was in 1990 by a Japanese team; this route is located on the Chinese side of the mountain. This route is known for its chaotic rock and snowfields all the way up to the summit.

; Northwest Ridge: First climbed in 1991 by a French team: Pierre Beghin and Christophe Profit. Finishes on North Ridge. The second attempt in 1995 by an American team, they reached 8100 metres the 2 August before turning back in deteriorating weather.

; South-southeast spur or &quot;Cesen route&quot; or &quot;Basque route&quot;: It runs the pillar between the Abruzzi Spur and the Polish Route. It connects with the Abruzzi Spur on the Shoulder, above the Black Pyramid and below the Bottleneck; since it avoids the Black Pyramid, it is considered safer. In 1986, Tomo Česen ascended to via this route. The first summit via this route was by a Basque team in 1994.

; West Face: Technical difficulty at high altitude, first climbed by a Russian team in 2007. This route is almost entirely made up of rock crevasses and snow-covered couloirs. In 2024, Japanese climbers Kazuya Hiraide and Kenro Nakajima were lost in attempting a new line on this route.

===Use of supplemental oxygen===
For most of its climbing history, K2 was not usually climbed with supplemental oxygen. Small, lightweight teams were the norm. However, the 2004 season saw a great increase in the use of oxygen: 28 of 47 summiteers used oxygen in that year.

Acclimatisation is essential when climbing without oxygen to avoid some degree of altitude sickness.
K2&#x27;s summit is well above the altitude at which high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) can occur. In mountaineering, when ascending above an altitude of , the climber enters what is known as the &quot;death zone&quot;.

<text>The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is a large reptile of the monitor lizard family Varanidae that is endemic to the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Dasami, and Gili Motang. It is the largest extant species of lizard, with the males growing to a maximum length of and weighing up to .

As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, and dominate the ecosystems in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. Komodo dragons&#x27; group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo dragons mainly consists of Javan rusa (&quot;Rusa timorensis&quot;), though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion. Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.

Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September; as many as 20 eggs are deposited at a time in an abandoned megapode nest or in a self-dug nesting hole. The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and dwell in trees to avoid predators, such as cannibalistic adults, which young Komodo dragons also try to repel by rolling in feces. They take 8 to 9 years to mature and are estimated to live up to 30 years.

Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910. Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has been reduced by human encroachment and is likely to contract further from the effects of climate change; hence, they are listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List. They are protected under Indonesian law, and Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to aid protection efforts.

==Taxonomy==
Komodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910, when rumors of a &quot;land crocodile&quot; reached Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek of the Dutch colonial administration. Widespread notoriety came after 1912, when Peter Ouwens, the director of the Zoological Museum of Bogor, Java, published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant, as well as two other specimens from a collector.

The first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were exhibited in the Reptile House at London Zoo when it opened in 1927. Joan Beauchamp Procter made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated their behaviour at a scientific meeting of the Zoological Society of London in 1928.

The Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to Komodo Island by W. Douglas Burden in 1926. After returning with 12 preserved specimens and two live ones, this expedition provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie &quot;King Kong&quot;. It was also Burden who coined the common name &quot;Komodo dragon&quot;. Three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the American Museum of Natural History.

The Dutch island administration, realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild, soon outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study. Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II, not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon&#x27;s feeding behavior, reproduction, and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969. During their stay, Walter Auffenberg and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons.

Research from the Auffenberg expedition proved enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in captivity. Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo dragon, with biologists such as Claudio Ciofi continuing to study the creatures.

===Etymology===

The Komodo dragon is also sometimes known as the Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor in scientific literature, although these names are uncommon. To the natives of Komodo Island, it is referred to as &quot;ora&quot;, &quot;buaya darat&quot; (&#x27;land crocodile&#x27;), or &quot;biawak raksasa&quot; (&#x27;giant monitor&#x27;).

===Evolutionary history===
Genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows the Komodo dragon to be the closest relative (sister taxon) of the Australian lace monitor (&quot;V. varius&quot;), with their common ancestor diverging from a lineage that gave rise to the crocodile monitor (&quot;Varanus salvadorii&quot;) of New Guinea. A 2021 study showed that during the late Miocene, the ancestors of Komodo dragons had hybridized with the common ancestor of Australian sand monitors (including &quot;V. spenceri&quot;, &quot;V. gouldii&quot;, &quot;V. rosenbergi&quot; and &quot;V. panoptes&quot;).

Fossils from across Queensland demonstrate that the Komodo dragon was once present in Australia, with fossils spanning from the Early Pliocene (~3.8 million years ago) to the Middle Pleistocene, with the youngest confirmed records of the species in Australia dating to at latest 330,000 years ago. In Australia, it coexisted with the even larger monitor species &quot;Varanus priscus&quot; also known as megalania, the largest terrestrial lizard ever. The oldest records of the Komodo dragon on Flores date to around 1.4 million years ago, during the Early Pleistocene. Additionally, Pleistocene fossils of &quot;Varanus&quot; found in Java and Timor may belong to the Komodo dragon.

==Description==
In the wild, adult Komodo dragons usually weigh around , although captive specimens often weigh more. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, an average adult male will weigh and measure , while an average female will weigh and measure . The largest verified specimen in captivity was long and weighed , including its undigested food. The largest wild specimen had a length , a snout-vent length (SVL) and a mass of excluding stomach contents. The heaviest reached a mass of . The study noted that weights greater than were possible but only after the animal had consumed a large meal.
The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as well as about 60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can measure up to in length. Its saliva is frequently blood-tinged because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding. It also has a long, yellow, deeply forked tongue. Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain-mail. The only areas lacking osteoderms on the head of the adult Komodo dragon are around the eyes, nostrils, mouth margins, and parietal eye, a light-sensing organ on the top of the head. Where lizards typically have one or two varying patterns or shapes of osteoderms, komodos have four: rosette, platy, dendritic, and vermiform. This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin a poor source of leather. Additionally, these osteoderms become more extensive and variable in shape as the Komodo dragon ages, ossifying more extensively as the lizard grows. These osteoderms are absent in hatchlings and juveniles, indicating that the natural armor develops as a product of age and competition between adults for protection in intraspecific combat over food and mates.

==Morphology==
===Dentition===
Komodo dragons have ziphodont teeth, which are defined as teeth that are laterally flattened, recurved, and with serrated tooth crowns where the serrations have a dentine core and a very thin enamel outer layer. This is the same type of dentition observed in many extinct theropod dinosaurs. The teeth of the insectivorous juveniles in contrast are barely recurved, with fewer and less well-developed serrations that lack dentine cores.

A 2024 study published in &quot;Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution&quot; found that Komodo dragons have orange, iron-enriched coatings on their tooth serrations and tips, as an adaptation for maintaining the sharp cutting edges. This feature is also observed to a lesser degree in a few other Australasian to Asian monitor species, though notably absent in a few other species from that range.

Teeth are quickly replaced every 40 days, while maintaining up to 5 replacement teeth for each tooth position at any given time. This high rate of replacement and large number of replacement teeth is similar to that of the crocodile monitor. Many other monitor species as well as Chinese crocodile lizards and beaded lizards only have 1-2 replacement teeth behind each tooth position.

===Senses===

As with other varanids, Komodo dragons have only a single ear bone, the stapes, for transferring vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. This arrangement means they are likely restricted to sounds in the 400 to 2,000 hertz range, compared to humans who hear between 20 and 20,000 hertz. They were formerly thought to be deaf when a study reported no agitation in wild Komodo dragons in response to whispers, raised voices, or shouts. This was disputed when London Zoo employee Joan Procter trained a captive specimen to come out to feed at the sound of her voice, even when she could not be seen.

The Komodo dragon can see objects as far away as , but because its retinas only contain cones, it is thought to have poor night vision. It can distinguish colours, but has poor visual discrimination of stationary objects.

As with many other reptiles, the Komodo dragon primarily relies on its tongue to detect, taste, and smell stimuli, with the vomeronasal sense using the Jacobson&#x27;s organ, rather than using the nostrils. With the help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks, a Komodo dragon may be able to detect carrion from away. It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat. Its scales, some of which are reinforced with bone, have sensory plaques connected to nerves to facilitate its sense of touch. The scales around the ears, lips, chin, and soles of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques.
==Behaviour and ecology==

The Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places and typically lives in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low elevations. As an ectotherm, it is most active in the day, although it exhibits some nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary, coming together only to breed and eat. They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to , diving up to , and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws. To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support. As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great size makes climbing impractical.

For shelter, the Komodo dragon digs holes that can measure from wide with its powerful forelimbs and claws. Because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows, it is able to conserve body heat throughout the night and minimise its basking period the morning after. The Komodo dragon stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day and hunts in the afternoon. These special resting places, usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes, are marked with droppings and are cleared of vegetation. They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer.

===Diet===

Komodo dragons are apex predators. They are carnivores; although they have been considered as eating mostly carrion, they will frequently ambush live prey with a stealthy approach. When suitable prey arrives near a dragon&#x27;s ambush site, it will suddenly charge at the animal at high speeds and go for the underside or the throat.

Komodo dragons do not deliberately allow the prey to escape with fatal injuries but try to kill prey outright using a combination of lacerating damage and blood loss. They have been recorded as killing wild pigs within seconds, and observations of Komodo dragons tracking prey for long distances are likely misinterpreted cases of prey escaping an attack before succumbing to infection. Most prey attacked by a Komodo dragon reputedly suffer from said sepsis and will later be eaten by the same or other lizards.

Komodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the carcass down with their forelegs. For smaller prey up to the size of a goat, their loosely articulated jaws, flexible skulls, and expandable stomachs allow them to swallow prey whole. The undigested vegetable contents of a prey animal&#x27;s stomach and intestines are typically avoided. Copious amounts of red saliva the Komodo dragons produce help to lubricate the food, but swallowing is still a long process (15–20 minutes to swallow a goat). A Komodo dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ramming the carcass against a tree to force it down its throat, sometimes ramming so forcefully that the tree is knocked down. A small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs allows it to breathe while swallowing.

After eating up to 80% of its body weight in one meal, it drags itself to a sunny location to speed digestion, as the food could rot and poison the dragon if left undigested in its stomach for too long. Because of their slow metabolism, large dragons can survive on as few as 12 meals a year. After digestion, the Komodo dragon regurgitates a mass of horns, hair, and teeth known as the gastric pellet, which is covered in malodorous mucus. After regurgitating the gastric pellet, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus.
The eating habits of Komodo dragons follow a hierarchy, with the larger animals generally eating before the smaller ones. The largest male typically asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their submission by use of body language and rumbling hisses. Dragons of equal size may resort to &quot;wrestling&quot;. Losers usually retreat, though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victors.

The Komodo dragon&#x27;s diet varies depending on stage of growth. Young Komodo dragons will eat insects, birds and bird&#x27;s eggs and small reptiles, while larger Komodo dragons (typically over ) prefer large ungulate prey, such as Javan rusa deer, wild pigs and water buffalo. Occasionally, they attack and bite humans. Sometimes they consume human corpses, digging up bodies from shallow graves. This habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of Komodo to move their graves from sandy to clay ground, and pile rocks on top of them, to deter the lizards. Dwarf species of &quot;Stegodon&quot; (a proboscidean related to living elephants) are suggested to have been a primary prey item of the Komodo dragon during the Pleistocene, prior to the introduction of their modern ungulate prey, which were only introduced to the islands in the Holocene, around 10-7,000 years ago.

The Komodo dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via buccal pumping (a process also used for respiration), lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat.

===Saliva===
Although previous studies proposed that Komodo dragon saliva contains a variety of highly septic bacteria that would help to bring down prey, research in 2013 suggested that the bacteria in the mouths of Komodo dragons are ordinary and similar to those found in other carnivores. Komodo dragons have good mouth hygiene. To quote Bryan Fry: &quot;After they are done feeding, they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip-licking and rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth ... Unlike people have been led to believe, they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their meals on their teeth, cultivating bacteria.&quot; They do have a slashing bite, which normally includes a dose of their neurotoxin venom and anticoagulant saliva. Komodo dragons do not wait for prey to die and track it at a distance, as vipers do; observations of them hunting deer, boar and in some cases buffalo reveal that they kill prey in less than half an hour.

The observation of prey dying of sepsis would then be explained by the natural instinct of water buffalos, which are not native to the islands where the Komodo dragon lives, to run into water after escaping an attack. The warm, faeces-filled water would then cause the infections. The study used samples from 16 captive dragons (10 adults and six neonates) from three US zoos.

===Antibacterial immune factor===
Researchers have isolated a powerful antibacterial peptide, VK25, from the blood plasma of Komodo dragons. Based on their analysis of this peptide, they have synthesized a short peptide dubbed DRGN-1 and tested it against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Preliminary results of these tests show that DRGN-1 is effective in killing drug-resistant bacterial strains and even some fungi. It has the added observed benefit of significantly promoting wound healing in both uninfected and mixed biofilm infected wounds.

===Disputed claims of venom===

In late 2005, researchers at the University of Melbourne speculated that the perentie (&quot;Varanus giganteus&quot;), other species of monitors, and agamids may be somewhat venomous. The team believes that the immediate effects of bites from these lizards were caused by mild envenomation. Bites on human digits by a lace monitor (&quot;V. varius&quot;), a Komodo dragon, and a spotted tree monitor (&quot;V. timorensis&quot;) all produced similar effects: rapid swelling, localised disruption of blood clotting, and shooting pain up to the elbow, with some symptoms lasting for several hours.

In 2009, the same researchers published further evidence demonstrating that Komodo dragons possess a venomous bite. MRI scans of a preserved skull showed the presence of two glands in the lower jaw. The researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminally ill dragon in the Singapore Zoological Gardens, and found it secreted several different toxic proteins. The known functions of these proteins include inhibition of blood clotting, lowering of blood pressure, muscle paralysis, and the induction of hypothermia, leading to shock and loss of consciousness in envenomated prey. As a result of the discovery, the previous theory that bacteria were responsible for the deaths of Komodo victims was disputed.

Other scientists have stated that this allegation of venom glands &quot;has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution.&quot; According to these scientists &quot;reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey.&quot; These researchers concluded, &quot;Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems.&quot; Evolutionary biologist Schwenk says that even if the lizards have venom-like proteins in their mouths they may be using them for a different function, and he doubts venom is necessary to explain the effect of a Komodo dragon bite, arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary factors. As of 2023, no clear unambiguous evidence of Komodo dragon bites being venomous has been presented.

===Reproduction===

Mating occurs between May and August, with the eggs laid in September. During this period, males fight over females and territory by grappling with one another upon their hind legs, with the loser eventually being pinned to the ground. These males may vomit or defecate when preparing for the fight. The winner of the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain information about her receptivity. Females are and resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of courtship. Therefore, the male must fully restrain the female during coitus to avoid being hurt. Other courtship displays include males rubbing their chins on the female, hard scratches to the back, and licking. Copulation occurs when the male inserts one of his hemipenes into the female&#x27;s cloaca. Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form &quot;pair bonds&quot;, a rare behavior for lizards.

Female Komodos lay their eggs from August to September and may use several types of locality; in one study, 60% laid their eggs in the nests of orange-footed scrubfowl (a moundbuilder or megapode), 20% on ground level and 20% in hilly areas. The females make many camouflage nests/holes to prevent other dragons from eating the eggs. Nests typically house one female, however a study found evidence of two females occasionally occupying the same den. Clutches contain an average of 20 eggs, which have an incubation period of 7–8 months. Hatching is an exhausting effort for the neonates, which break out of their eggshells with an egg tooth that falls off before long. After cutting themselves out, the hatchlings may lie in their eggshells for hours before starting to dig out of the nest. They are born quite defenseless and are vulnerable to predation. Sixteen youngsters from a single nest were on average 46.5 cm long and weighed 105.1 grams.

Young Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees, where they are relatively safe from predators, including cannibalistic adults, as juvenile dragons make up 10% of their diets. The habit of cannibalism may be advantageous in sustaining the large size of adults, as medium-sized prey on the islands is rare. When the young approach a kill, they roll around in faecal matter and rest in the intestines of eviscerated animals to deter these hungry adults. Komodo dragons take approximately 8 to 9 years to mature, and may live for up to 30 years.

====Parthenogenesis====
A Komodo dragon at London Zoo named Sungai laid a clutch of eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for more than two years. Scientists initially assumed she had been able to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male, an adaptation known as superfecundation. On 20 December 2006, it was reported that Flora, a captive Komodo dragon living in the Chester Zoo in England, was the second known Komodo dragon to have laid unfertilised eggs: she laid 11 eggs, and seven of them hatched, all of them male. Scientists at Liverpool University in England performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being moved to an incubator, and verified Flora had never been in physical contact with a male dragon. After Flora&#x27;s eggs&#x27; condition had been discovered, testing showed Sungai&#x27;s eggs were also produced without outside fertilization. On 31 January 2008, the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, became the first zoo in the Americas to document parthenogenesis in Komodo dragons. The zoo has two adult female Komodo dragons, one of which laid about 17 eggs on 19–20 May 2007. Only two eggs were incubated and hatched due to space issues; the first hatched on 31 January 2008, while the second hatched on 1 February. Both hatchlings were males.

Komodo dragons have the ZW chromosomal sex-determination system, as opposed to the mammalian XY system. Male progeny prove Flora&#x27;s unfertilized eggs were haploid (n) and doubled their chromosomes later to become diploid (2n) (by being fertilized by a polar body, or by chromosome duplication without cell division), rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the meiosis reduction-divisions in her ovaries failing. When a female Komodo dragon (with ZW sex chromosomes) reproduces in this manner, she provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes, including only one of her two sex chromosomes. This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg, which develops parthenogenetically. Eggs receiving a Z chromosome become ZZ (male); those receiving a W chromosome become WW and fail to develop, meaning that only males are produced by parthenogenesis in this species.It has been hypothesised that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated ecological niche (such as an island) and by parthenogenesis produce male offspring, thereby establishing a sexually reproducing population (via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and female young). Despite the advantages of such an adaptation, zoos are cautioned that parthenogenesis may be detrimental to genetic diversity.

===Encounters with humans===
Attacks on humans are rare, but Komodo dragons have been responsible for several human fatalities, both in the wild and in captivity. According to data from Komodo National Park spanning a 38-year period between 1974 and 2012, there were 24 reported attacks on humans, five of them fatal. Most of the victims were local villagers living around the national park.

==Conservation==

The Komodo dragon is classified by the IUCN as Endangered and is listed on the IUCN Red List. The species&#x27; sensitivity to natural and human-made threats has long been recognized by conservationists, zoological societies, and the Indonesian government. Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on islands including Komodo, Rinca, and Padar. Later, the Wae Wuul and Wolo Tado Reserves were opened on Flores to aid Komodo dragon conservation.

Komodo dragons generally avoid encounters with humans. Juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about . Older animals will also retreat from humans from a shorter distance away. If cornered, they may react aggressively by gaping their mouth, hissing, and swinging their tail. If they are disturbed further, they may attack and bite. Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans, most of these reports are either not reputable or have subsequently been interpreted as defensive bites. Only very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by atypical individuals who lost their fear of humans.

Volcanic activity, earthquakes, loss of habitat, fire, tourism, loss of prey due to poaching, and illegal poaching of the dragons themselves have all contributed to the vulnerable status of the Komodo dragon. A major future threat to the species is climate change via both aridification and sea level rise, which can affect the low-lying habitats and valleys that the Komodo dragon depends on, as Komodo dragons do not range into the higher-altitude regions of the islands they inhabit. Based on projections, climate change will lead to a decline in suitable habitat of 8.4%, 30.2%, or 71% by 2050 depending on the climate change scenario. Without effective conservation actions, populations on Flores are extirpated in all scenarios, while in the more extreme scenarios, only the populations on Komodo and Rinca persist in highly reduced numbers. Rapid climate change mitigation is crucial for conserving the species in the wild. Other scientists have disputed the conclusions about the effects of climate change on Komodo dragon populations.

Under Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), commercial international trade of Komodo dragon skins or specimens is prohibited. Despite this, there are occasional reports of illegal attempts to trade in live Komodo dragons. The most recent attempt was in March 2019, when Indonesian police in the East Java city of Surabaya reported that a criminal network had been caught trying to smuggle 41 young Komodo dragons out of Indonesia. The plan was said to include shipping the animals to several other countries in Southeast Asia through Singapore. It was hoped that the animals could be sold for up to 500 million rupiah (around US$35,000) each. It was believed that the Komodo dragons had been smuggled out of East Nusa Tenggara province through the port at Ende in central Flores.

In 2013, the total population of Komodo dragons in the wild was assessed as 3,222 individuals, declining to 3,092 in 2014 and 3,014 in 2015. Populations remained relatively stable on the bigger islands (Komodo and Rinca), but decreased on smaller islands, such as Nusa Kode and Gili Motang, likely due to diminishing prey availability. On Padar, a former population of Komodo dragons has recently become extirpated, of which the last individuals were seen in 1975. It is widely assumed that the Komodo dragon died out on Padar following a major decline of populations of large ungulate prey, for which poaching was most likely responsible.

===In captivity===

Komodo dragons have long been sought-after zoo attractions, where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily reproduce in captivity. A pair of Komodo dragons was displayed at the Bronx Zoo in New York in September 1926, but they only lasted a couple of months, dying in October and November 1926. The first Komodo dragons were displayed at London Zoo in 1927. A Komodo dragon was exhibited in 1934 in the United States at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., but it lived for only two years. More attempts to exhibit Komodo dragons were made, but the lifespan of the animals in captivity at the time proved very short, averaging five years in the National Zoological Park. Studies were done by Walter Auffenberg, which were documented in his book &quot;The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor&quot;, eventually allowing for more successful management and breeding of the dragons in captivity. Surabaya Zoo in Indonesia has been breeding Komodo dragons since 1990 and had 134 dragons in 2022, the largest collection outside its natural habitat. As of May 2009, there were 35 North American, 13 European, one Singaporean, two African, and two Australian institutions which housed captive Komodo dragons. In 2016, four Komodo dragons were transferred from Bronx zoo to Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in India.

A variety of behaviors have been observed from captive specimens. Most individuals become relatively tame within a short time, and are capable of recognising individual humans and discriminating between familiar and unfamiliar keepers. Komodo dragons have also been observed to engage in play with a variety of objects, including shovels, cans, plastic rings, and shoes. This behavior does not seem to be &quot;food-motivated predatory behavior&quot;.

Even seemingly docile dragons may become unpredictably aggressive, especially when the animal&#x27;s territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar. In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously injured Phil Bronstein, the then-husband of actress Sharon Stone, when he entered its enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot, as the keeper had told him to take off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same colour as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon. Although he survived, Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically.
