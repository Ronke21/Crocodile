<doc id="16793" wikidata="Q647500" url="?curid=16793" title="Korean cuisine">
<text>Korean cuisine is the set of foods and culinary styles which are associated with Korean culture. This cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine reflects a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.

Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and (at least in South Korea) meats. Dairy is largely absent from the traditional Korean diet. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes () that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, (pepper flakes), (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. Many regional dishes have become national. Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Foods are regulated by Korean cultural etiquette.

Kimjang, which means making kimchi, is listed on UNESCO Intangible Heritage List.

==History==

===Prehistoric===
In the Jeulmun pottery period (approximately 8000 to 1500 BCE), hunter-gatherer societies engaged in fishing and hunting, and incipient agriculture in the later stages. Since the beginning of the Mumun pottery period (1500 BCE), agricultural traditions began to develop with new migrant groups from the Liao River basin of Manchuria. During the Mumun period, people grew millet, barley, wheat, legumes and rice, and continued to hunt and fish. Archaeological remains point to development of fermented beans during this period, and cultural contact with nomadic cultures to the north facilitated domestication of animals.

===Three Kingdoms period===
The Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE – 668 CE) was one of rapid cultural evolution. The kingdom of Goguryeo (37 BCE – 668 CE) was located in the northern part of the peninsula along much of modern-day Manchuria. The second kingdom, Baekje (18 BCE – 660 CE), was in the southwestern portion of the peninsula, and the third, Silla (57 BCE – 935 CE), was located at the southeastern portion of the peninsula. Each region had its own distinct set of cultural practices and foods. For example, Baekje was known for cold foods and fermented foods like &quot;kimchi&quot;. The spread of Buddhism and Confucianism through cultural exchanges with China during the fourth century CE began to change the distinct cultures of Korea.

Attributed with the earliest kimchi, the Goguryeo people were skilled at fermenting and widely consumed fermented food.

===Goryeo period===

During the latter Goryeo period, the Mongols invaded Goryeo in the 13th century. Some traditional foods found today in Korea have their origins during this period. The dumpling dish, &quot;mandu&quot;, grilled meat dishes, noodle dishes, and the use of seasonings such as black pepper, all have their roots in this period.

===Joseon period===
Agricultural innovations were significant and widespread during this period, such as the invention of the rain gauge during the 15th century. During 1429, the government began publishing books on agriculture and farming techniques, which included &quot;Nongsa jikseol&quot; (literally &quot;Straight Talk on Farming&quot;), an agricultural book compiled under King Sejong.

A series of invasions in the earlier half of the Joseon caused a dynamic shift in the culture during the second half of the period. Groups of &quot;silhak&quot; (&quot;practical learning&quot;) scholars began to emphasize the importance of looking outside the country for innovation and technology to help improve the agricultural systems. Crops traded by Europeans from the New World began to appear, acquired through trade with China, Japan, Europe, and the Philippines; these crops included maize, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, peanuts, and squash. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were particularly favored as they grew in soils and on terrains that were previously unused.

Government further developed agriculture through technology and lower taxation. Complex irrigation systems built by government allowed peasant farmers to produce larger crop volumes and produce crops not only for sustenance but also as cash crops. Reduced taxation of the peasantry also furthered the expanded commerce through increasing periodic markets, usually held every five days. One thousand such markets existed in the 19th century, and were communal centers for economic trade and entertainment.

The end of the Joseon period was marked by consistent encouragement to trade with the Western world, China and Japan. In the 1860s, trade agreements pushed by the Japanese government led the Joseon dynasty to open its trade ports with the west, and to numerous treaties with the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries.

The opening of Korea to the Western world brought further exchange of culture and food. Western missionaries introduced new ingredients and dishes to Korea. Joseon elites were introduced to these new foods by way of foreigners who attended the royal court as advisers or physicians. This period also saw the introduction of various seasonings imported from Japan via western traders and alcoholic drinks from China.

===Colonial period to modern period===


Japan occupied the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Many of its agricultural systems were taken over by the Japanese to support Japan&#x27;s food supply. Land changes resulting from the Japanese occupation included combining small farms into large-scale farms, which led to larger yields. Rice production increased during this period to support the Japanese Empire&#x27;s war efforts. Many Koreans, in turn, increased the production of other grains for their own consumption.

Meals during the Japanese occupation were quite varied. Koreans usually ate two meals a day during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes, satiety, rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy only a single bowl of white rice &quot;each year&quot;, while the remainder of the year was filled with cheaper grains, such as millet and barley. For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as white bread and commercially produced staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during World War II.

The country remained in a state of turmoil through the Korean War (1950–1953) and the Cold War, which separated the country into North Korea and South Korea. Both of these periods continued the limited food provisions for Koreans, and the stew called &quot;budae jjigae&quot;, which makes use of inexpensive meats such as sausage and Spam, originated during this period.

At this point, the history of North and South Korea sharply diverged. In the 1960s under President Park Chung Hee, industrialization began to give South Korea the economic and cultural power it holds in the global economy today. Agriculture was increased through use of commercial fertilizers and modern farming equipment. In the 1970s, food shortages began to lessen. Consumption of instant and processed foods increased, as did the overall quality of foods. Livestock and dairy production was increased during the 1970s through the increase of commercial dairies and mechanized farms. The consumption of pork and beef increased vastly in the 1970s. Per-capita consumption of meat was 3.6 kg in 1961 and 11 kg by 1979. The result of this increased meat consumption brought about the rise of &quot;bulgogi&quot; restaurants, which gave the middle class of South Korea the ability to enjoy meat regularly. Meat eating continued to rise, reaching 40 kg in 1997, with fish consumption at 49.5 kg in 1998. Rice consumption continually decreased through these years, from 128 kg consumed per person in 1985 to 106 kg in 1995 and 83 kg in 2003. The decrease in rice consumption has been accompanied by an increase in the consumption of bread and noodles. In 2009, the South Korean government launched a $77-million culinary diplomacy program called &quot;Korean Cuisine to the World&quot; to promote its cuisine and subsequently pivoted into the markets in the United States and Muslim countries.

==Food==

===Grains===
Grains have been one of the most important staples of the Korean diet. Early myths of the foundations of various kingdoms in Korea center on grains. One foundation myth relates to Jumong, who received barley seeds from two doves sent by his mother after establishing the kingdom of Goguryeo. Yet another myth speaks of the three founding deities of Jeju Island, who were to be wed to the three princesses of Tamna; the deities brought seeds of five grains which were the first seeds planted, which in turn became the first instance of farming.

During the pre-modern era, grains such as barley and millet were the main staples. They were supplemented by wheat, sorghum, and buckwheat. Rice is not an indigenous crop to Korea and millet was likely the preferred grain before rice was cultivated. Rice became the grain of choice during the Three Kingdoms period, particularly in the Silla and Baekje Kingdoms in the southern regions of the peninsula. Rice was such an important commodity in Silla that it was used to pay taxes. The Sino-Korean word for &quot;tax&quot; is a compound character that uses the character for the rice plant. The preference for rice escalated into the Joseon period, when new methods of cultivation and new varieties emerged that would help increase production.

As rice was prohibitively expensive when it first came to Korea, the grain was likely mixed with other grains to &quot;stretch&quot; the rice; this is still done in dishes such as &quot;boribap&quot; (rice with barley) and &quot;kongbap&quot; (rice with beans). White rice, which is rice with the bran removed, has been the preferred form of rice since its introduction into the cuisine. The most traditional method of cooking the rice has been to cook it in an iron pot called a &quot;sot&quot; () or &quot;musoe sot&quot; (). This method of rice cookery dates back to at least the Goryeo period, and these pots have even been found in tombs from the Silla period. The &quot;sot&quot; is still used today, much in the same manner as it was in the past centuries.

Rice is used to make a number of items, outside of the traditional bowl of plain white rice. It is commonly ground into a flour and used to make rice cakes called &quot;tteok&quot; in over two hundred varieties. It is also cooked down into a congee (&quot;juk&quot;) or gruel (&quot;mieum&quot;) and mixed with other grains, meat, or seafood. Koreans also produce a number of rice wines, both in filtered and unfiltered versions. Grains have also been used for centuries to make misu and misu-garu, drinks made from grain powder that are sometimes used as meal supplements.

===Fruits===
Encompassing a wide range of temperate climates, the Korean peninsula supports the growth of many cultivated and wild fruit species. Asian pears of numerous varieties, apples, melons and berries and more are typical of summer and fall produce.

===Legumes===

Legumes have been significant crops in Korean history and cuisine, according to the earliest preserved legumes found in archaeological sites in Korea. The excavation at Okbang site, Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province indicates soybeans were cultivated as a food crop &quot;circa&quot; 1000–900 BCE. They are still made into dubu (tofu), while soybean sprouts are sauteed as a vegetable (&quot;kongnamul&quot;) and whole soybeans are seasoned and served as a side dish. They are also made into soy milk, which is used as the base for the noodle dish called &quot;kongguksu&quot;. A byproduct of soy milk production is &quot;biji&quot; or &quot;kong-biji&quot;, which is used to thicken stews and porridges. Soybeans may also be one of the beans in &quot;kongbap&quot;, boiled together with several types of beans and other grains, and they are also the primary ingredient in the production of fermented condiments collectively referred to as &quot;jang&quot;, such as soybean pastes, &quot;doenjang&quot; and &quot;cheonggukjang&quot;, a soy sauce called &quot;ganjang&quot;, chili pepper paste or &quot;gochujang&quot; and others.

Nokdu (Mung bean) is commonly used in Korean cuisine. &quot;Sukju namuls (Mung bean sprouts)&quot; are often served as a side dish, blanched and sautéed with sesame oil, garlic, and salt. Ground Nokdu is used to make a porridge called &quot;nokdujuk&quot;, which is eaten as a nutritional supplement and digestive aid, especially for ill patients. A popular snack, &quot;bindaetteok&quot; (mung bean pancake), is made with ground nokdu and fresh sukju namul. Starch extracted from ground nokdu is used to make transparent dangmyeon ( cellophane noodles). The dangmyeons are the main ingredients for &quot;japchae&quot; (a salad-like dish) and &quot;sundae&quot; (a blood sausage), and are a subsidiary ingredient for soups and stews. The starch can be also used to make jelly-like foods, such as &quot;nokdumuk&quot; and &quot;hwangpomuk&quot;. The &quot;muk&quot; have a bland flavor, so are served seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil and crumbled seaweed or other seasonings such as &quot;tangpyeongchae&quot;.

Cultivation of azuki beans dates back to ancient times according to an excavation from Odong-ri, Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province, which is assumed to be that of Mumun period (approximately 1500–300 BCE). Azuki beans are generally eaten as &quot;patbap&quot;, which is a bowl of rice mixed with the beans, or as a filling and covering for &quot;tteok&quot; (rice cake) and breads. A porridge made with azuki beans, called &quot;patjuk&quot;, is commonly eaten during the winter season. On Dongjinal, a Korean traditional holiday which falls on December 22, Korean people eat &quot;donji patjuk&quot;, which contains &quot;saealsim&quot; (), a ball made from glutinous rice flour. In old Korean tradition, &quot;patjuk&quot; is believed to have the power to drive evil spirits away.

===Condiments and seasoning===
Condiments are divided into fermented and nonfermented variants. Fermented condiments include &quot;ganjang&quot;, &quot;doenjang&quot;, &quot;gochujang&quot; and vinegars. Nonfermented condiments or spices include red pepper, black pepper, cordifolia, mustard, chinensis, garlic, onion, ginger, leek, and scallion (spring onion).

===Gochujang===
Gochujang can be found in many writings. Some of the writings are the &#x27;, &quot;The Three States&quot;, the &quot;Nonggawolryeongga&quot;, the &quot;Gijaejapgi&quot;, and the &#x27;. The &quot;Hyangyak-jipseongbang&quot;, which dates back to around 1433 during the Chosun dynasty, is one of the oldest writings mentioning gochujang.

Gochujang is a fermented bean paste that has red pepper powder, soybean powder and rice flour added to it to create a spicy paste. It typically can be added to most dishes. Gochujang can be used as a seasoning and sometimes as a dipping sauce.

Many variations come from &quot;jang&quot;, fermented bean paste. Some variations can include doenjang (soybean and brine), kanjang (soybeans, water, and salt), chogochujang (gochujang and vinegar), and jeotgal (mixture of other jangs and seafoods).

Vegetables such as cucumbers, carrots, and cabbage use gochujang as a dip. Gochujang is a common seasoning for foods such as Korean barbecue including pork and beef. One popular snack food that is very commonly eaten with gochujang is bibimbap. Bibimbap includes rice, spinach, radish, bean sprouts. Sometimes beef is added to bibimbap. Another popular dish including gochujang is tteokbokki.

Gochujang was believed to revitalize people who were sick with colds or exhaustion during the Gio period. There have been some studies that show that red peppers fight obesity and diabetes. Gochujang is also added to many foods so that there can be additional nutritional value with each meal.

===Meat===
In antiquity, most meat in Korea was likely obtained through hunting and fishing. Ancient records indicate rearing of livestock began on a small scale during the Three Kingdoms period. Meat was consumed roasted or in soups or stews during this period. Those who lived closer to the oceans were able to complement their diet with more fish, while those who lived in the interior had a diet containing more meat.

====Beef====

Beef is the most prized of all, with cattle holding an important cultural role in the Korean home. Beef is prepared in numerous ways today, including roasting, grilling (&quot;gui&quot;) or boiling in soups. Beef can also be dried into &quot;yukpo&quot;, a type of &quot;po&quot;, as with seafood, called &quot;eopo&quot;.

The cattle were valuable draught animals, often seen as equal to human servants, or in some cases, members of the family. Cattle were also given their own holiday during the first &#x27;cow&#x27; day of the lunar New Year. The importance of cattle does not suggest Koreans ate an abundance of beef, however, as the cattle were valued as beasts of burden and slaughtering one would create dire issues in farming the land. Pork and seafood were consumed more regularly for this reason. The Buddhist ruling class of the Goryeo period forbade the consumption of beef. The Mongols dispensed with the ban of beef during the 13th century, and they promoted the production of beef cattle. This increased production continued into the Joseon period, when the government encouraged both increased quantities and quality of beef. Only in the latter part of the 20th century has beef become regular table fare.

====Chicken====
Chicken has played an important role as a protein in Korean history, evidenced by a number of myths. One myth tells of the birth of Kim Alji, founder of the Kim family of Gyeongju being announced by the cry of a white chicken. As the birth of a clan&#x27;s founder is always announced by an animal with preternatural qualities, this myth speaks to the importance of chicken in Korean culture. Chicken is often served roasted or braised with vegetables or in soups. All parts of the chicken are used in Korean cuisine, including the gizzard, liver, and feet. Young chickens are braised with ginseng and other ingredients in medicinal soups eaten during the summer months to combat heat called &quot;samgyetang&quot;. The feet of the chicken, called &quot;dakbal&quot; (), are often roasted and covered with hot and spicy &quot;gochujang&quot;-based sauce and served as an &quot;anju&quot;, or side dish, to accompany alcoholic beverages, especially &quot;soju&quot;.

====Pork====

Pork has also been another important land-based protein for Korea. Records indicate pork has been a part of the Korean diet back to antiquity, similar to beef.

A number of foods have been avoided while eating pork, including Chinese bellflower (&quot;doraji&quot;, 도라지) and lotus root (&quot;yeonn ppuri&quot;, 연뿌리), as the combinations have been thought to cause diarrhea. All parts of the pig are used in Korean cuisine, including the head, intestines, liver, kidney and other internal organs. Koreans utilize these parts in a variety of cooking methods including steaming, stewing, boiling and smoking. Koreans especially like to eat grilled pork belly, which is called &quot;samgyeopsal&quot;.

====Fish and seafood====
Fish and shellfish have been a major part of Korean cuisine because of the oceans bordering the peninsula. Evidence from the 12th century illustrates commoners consumed a diet mostly of fish and shellfish, such as shrimp, clams, oysters, abalone, and loach, while sheep and hogs were reserved for the upper class.

Both fresh and saltwater fish are popular, and are served raw, grilled, broiled, dried or served in soups and stews. Common grilled fish include mackerel, hairtail, croaker and Pacific herring. Smaller fish, shrimp, squid, mollusks and countless other seafood can be salted and fermented as &quot;jeotgal&quot;. Fish can also be grilled either whole or in fillets as banchan. Fish is often dried naturally to prolong storing periods and enable shipping over long distances. Fish commonly dried include yellow corvina, anchovies (&quot;myeolchi&quot;) and croaker. Dried anchovies, along with kelp, form the basis of common soup stocks.

Shellfish is widely eaten in all different types of preparation. They can be used to prepare broth, eaten raw with &quot;chogochujang&quot;, which is a mixture of &quot;gochujang&quot; and vinegar, or used as a popular ingredient in countless dishes. Raw oysters and other seafood can be used in making kimchi to improve and vary the flavor. Salted baby shrimp are used as a seasoning agent, known as &quot;saeujeot&quot;, for the preparation of some types of kimchi. Large shrimp are often grilled as &quot;daeha gui&quot; () or dried, mixed with vegetables and served with rice. Mollusks eaten in Korean cuisine include octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.

===Vegetables===
Korean cuisine uses a wide variety of vegetables, which are often served uncooked, either in salads or pickles, as well as cooked in various stews, stir-fried dishes, and other hot dishes. Commonly used vegetables include Korean radish, napa cabbage, cucumber, potato, sweet potato, spinach, bean sprouts, scallions, garlic, chili peppers, seaweed, zucchini, mushrooms, lotus root. Several types of wild greens, known collectively as &quot;chwinamul&quot; (such as &quot;Aster scaber&quot;), are a popular dish, and other wild vegetables such as bracken fern shoots (&quot;gosari&quot;) or Korean bellflower root (&quot;doraji&quot;) are also harvested and eaten in season. Traditional medicinal herbs in Korean cuisine, such as ginseng, lingzhi mushroom, wolfberry, &quot;Codonopsis pilosula&quot;, and &quot;Angelica sinensis&quot;, are often used as ingredients in cooking, as in &quot;samgyetang&quot;.

===Medicinal foods===
Medicinal food (&quot;boyangshik&quot;) is a wide variety of specialty foods prepared and eaten for their purported medicinal purposes, especially during the hottest 30-day period in the lunar calendar, called &quot;sambok&quot;. Hot foods consumed are believed to restore &quot;ki&quot;, as well as sexual and physical stamina lost in the summer heat. Commonly eaten &quot;boyangshik&quot; include ginseng, chicken, black goat, abalone, eel, carp, beef bone soups, pig kidneys.

==== Samgyetang ====
&quot;Samgyetang&quot; is a chicken ginseng soup traditionally consumed during Boknal () days: the hottest days of summer. It is a Korean custom to eat hot food in hot weather called Iyeolchiyeol (), which means &quot;controlling heat with heat&quot;. Consequently, Samgyetang is Koreans&#x27; favorite energizing food and it is common to have it on sambok () days — Chobok (), Jungbok () and Malbok () — which are believed to be the hottest days in Korea.

==Dishes==

Korean foods can be largely categorized into groups of &quot;main staple foods&quot; (), &quot;subsidiary dishes&quot; (), and &quot;dessert&quot; (). The main dishes are made from grains such as &quot;bap&quot; (a bowl of rice), &quot;juk&quot; (porridge), and &quot;guksu&quot; (noodles).

Many Korean &quot;banchan&quot; rely on fermentation for flavor and preservation, resulting in a tangy, salty, and spicy taste. Certain regions are especially associated with some dishes (for example, the city of Jeonju with &quot;bibimbap&quot;) either as a place of origin or for a famous regional variety. Restaurants will often use these famous names on their signs or menus (e.g. &quot;Suwon galbi&quot;).

===Soups and stews===
Soups are a common part of any Korean meal. Unlike other cultures, in Korean culture, soup is served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal, as an accompaniment to rice along with other banchan. Soups known as &quot;guk&quot; are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Soups can be made into more formal soups known as &quot;tang&quot;, often served as the main dish of the meal. &quot;Jjigae&quot; are a thicker, heavier seasoned soups or stews.

Some popular types of soups are:
* &quot;Malgeunguk&quot; (), are flavoured with &quot;ganjang&quot;. Small amounts of long boiled meat may be added to the soup, or seafood both fresh and dried may be added, or vegetables may be the main component for the clear soup.
* &quot;Doenjang-guk&quot; are seasoned with &quot;doenjang&quot;. Common ingredients for &quot;tojang guk&quot; include seafood such as clams, dried anchovies, and shrimp. For a spicier soup, &quot;gochujang&quot; is added.
* &quot;Tteok-guk&quot; is a rice cake soup commonly made with sliced rice cakes and beef broth. White rice cake was called Baekbyeong (백병-白餠) or Geomo (거모-擧摸). Tteok-guk is made with thinly sliced garae-tteok, are long, cylindrical shaped rice cakes made with rice flour. Tteok-guk is boiled in chicken broth, but was originally boiled in pheasant meat soup. It says, &quot;hunting pheasant is not easy, and since they breed chickens, they use chicken instead of pheasant, and if there&#x27;s not chicken they even used beef&quot;(). In North Korea, there is a variation of this recipe called joraengi tteokguk where rice cakes are made in the shape of balls. it is eaten on New Year&#x27;s Day because Koreans believe that if you eat a bowl of tteok-guk on the first of the lunar year, you get one year older. There is the belief that rice cakes in oval shape bring fortune since they resemble old Korean coins known as yeopjeon ().
* &quot;Gomguk&quot; or &quot;gomtang&quot; (), and they are made from boiling beef bones or cartilage. Originating as a peasant dish, all parts of beef are used, including tail, leg and rib bones with or without meat attached; these are boiled in water to extract fat, marrow, and gelatin to create a rich soup. Some versions of this soup may also use the beef head and intestines. The only seasoning generally used in the soup is salt.
* &quot;Naengguk&quot;, which are cold soups generally eaten during the summer months to cool the diner. A light hand is usually used in the seasoning of these soups usually using &quot;ganjang&quot; and sesame oil.
*Shin-son-ro (or koo-ja tang), the name of it came from its special cook pot with chimney for burning charcoal. The meaning is a hearth or furnace or a pot for fire or incense burning that always contains nineteen fillings. The nineteen fillings were including beef, fish, eggs, carrot, mushrooms, and onion.

Stews are referred to as &quot;jjigae&quot;, and are often a shared side dish. &quot;Jjigae&quot; is often both cooked and served in the glazed earthenware pot (&quot;ttukbaegi&quot;) in which it is cooked. The most common version of this stew is &quot;doenjang jjigae&quot;, which is a stew of soybean paste, with many variations; common ingredients include vegetables, saltwater or freshwater fish, and tofu. The stew often changes with the seasons and which ingredients are available. Other common varieties of &quot;jjigae&quot; contain kimchi (&quot;kimchi jjigae&quot;) or tofu (&quot;sundubu jjigae&quot;).

* &quot;Miyeok-guk&quot;. This soup is made of dried seaweed according to 조선요리제법, it says it is usually made by frying 미역 with beef pouring water and making the soup. Adding mussel can make it taste better. Also in coastal areas they use fish instead of beef too. It is usually consumed on Koreans birthday, specifically on samchil day (삼칠일: a resting period after giving birth to the newborn); baek-il (백일: the 100th day after a baby is born); doljanchi (돌잔치: the baby&#x27;s first birthday). The Korean tradition of mothers eating seaweed after birth originated in Goguryeo. The Korean word for seaweed, &quot;miyeok&quot;, originated in Goguryeo.

===Kimchi===
Kimchi refers to often fermented vegetable dishes, usually made with napa cabbage, Korean radish, or sometimes cucumber. There are 4 types of raw materials which are major ones: spices, seasonings, and other additional materials. Red and black pepper, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, onion, and mustard are the example of spices. There are endless varieties with regional variations, and it is served as a side dish or cooked into soups and rice dishes. In the late 15th century, it depicted Korean&#x27;s custom that Korean ancestors buried kimchi jars in the ground for storage for the entire winter season, as fermented foods can keep for several years. These were stored in traditional Korean mud pots known as jangdokdae, although with the advent of refrigerators, special kimchi freezers and commercially produced kimchi, this practice has become less common. Kimchi is a vegetable-based food which includes low calorie, low fat, and no cholesterol. Also, it is a rich source of various vitamins and minerals. It contains vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin K and minerals which are calcium, iron, phosphorus, and selenium. The same lactobacilli bacteria found in yogurt and other fermented dairy products are also found in kimchi. In 2021, Koreans collectively consumed 1,965,000 tons of Kimchi, with average Korean consuming 88.3 grams of Kimchi daily.

===Noodles===
Noodles or noodle dishes in Korean cuisine are collectively referred to as &quot;guksu&quot; in native Korean or &quot;myeon&quot; in hanja. While noodles were eaten in Korea from ancient times, productions of wheat was less than other crops, so wheat noodles did not become a daily food until 1945. Wheat noodles (&quot;milguksu&quot;) were specialty foods for birthdays, weddings or auspicious occasions because the long and continued shape were thought to be associated with the bliss for longevity and long-lasting marriage.

In Korean traditional noodle dishes are &quot;onmyeon&quot; or &quot;guksu jangguk&quot; (noodles with a hot clear broth), &quot;naengmyeon&quot; (cold buckwheat noodles), &quot;bibim guksu&quot; (cold noodle dish mixed with vegetables), &quot;kalguksu&quot; (knife-cut noodles), &quot;kongguksu&quot; (noodles with a cold soybean broth), &quot;japchae&quot; (cellophane noodles made from sweet potato with various vegetables) and others. In royal court, &quot;baekmyeon&quot; (literally &quot;white noodles&quot;) consisting of buckwheat noodles and pheasant broth, was regarded as the top quality noodle dish. &quot;Naengmyeon&quot; with a cold soup mixed with &quot;dongchimi&quot; (watery radish kimchi) and beef brisket broth was eaten in court during summer.

* &quot;Jajangmyeon&quot;, a staple Koreanized Chinese noodle dish, is extremely popular in Korea as fast, take-out food. It is made with a black bean sauce usually fried with diced pork or seafood and a variety of vegetables, including zucchini and potatoes. It is popularly ordered and delivered, like Chinese take-out food in other parts of the world.
* &quot;Ramyeon&quot; refers to Korean instant noodles similar to ramen.
* &quot;Japchae&quot; is a dish made by inserting in boiling water roasted vegetables, mushrooms and meat, each of them roasted. This is one of the most popular dishes in Korean tradition enjoyed on special occasion like weddings, holidays and birthday. There are two types of Japchae, one that includes glass noodles and another without noodles. According to the Korean cookbook Diminbang 음식디미방 (around 1670), there&#x27;s only the recipe without glass noodles. The original recipe without glass noodles is made by boiling vegetables such as cucumbers, pine mushrooms, bean sprouts, bellflowers green onion, then they are sprinkled with ginger, pepper, sesame oil, and flour. The sauce is made by boiling minced pink meat and soybean paste that is lightly filtered with sesame oil and flour. To match the name more than 20 ingredients were used. In Gyongon Yoram [규곤요람閨壼要覽 (1896)] is also recorded japchae seasoned with mustard sauce without glass noodles. However, since the 1930s, appears the japchae recipe with glass noodles alongside the original recipe. Also, during the Joseon dynasty [조선요리법朝鮮料理法] the recipe of japchae, with and without glass noodles, was added to the cookbook. Also, there is also a variant of japchae with meat, or one with abalone or other seafood in 1930s.It is a local food that shows the traditional recipe. In the Jinju region, Jamung-sam, Yokimun, is a local dish with soy sauce and sesame oil, and the seafood, such as octopus, skates, and mixed several vegetables stained in oil. Because it uses various ingredients, it has high calorie, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, and sufficient nutritional. It is the first item to choose when you want a feast table.

===Banchan===
Banchan is a term referring collectively to side dishes in Korean cuisine. Soups and stews are not considered banchan. 

&quot;Gui&quot; are grilled dishes, which most commonly have meat or fish as their primary ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked at the center of the table over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various &quot;banchan&quot; and individual rice bowls. The cooked meat is then cut into small pieces and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, thinly sliced garlic, &quot;ssamjang&quot; (a mixture of &quot;gochujang&quot; and &quot;dwenjang&quot;), and other seasonings. The suffix &quot;gui&quot; is often omitted in the names of meat-based &quot;gui&quot; such as &quot;galbi&quot;, the name of which was originally &quot;galbi gui&quot;.

&quot;Jjim&quot; and &quot;seon&quot; (steamed dishes) are generic terms referring to steamed or boiled dishes in Korean cuisine. However, the former is made with meat or seafood-based ingredients marinated in &quot;gochujang&quot; or &quot;ganjang&quot; while &quot;seon&quot; is made with vegetable stuffed with fillings.

&quot;Hoe&quot; (raw dishes): although the term originally referred to any kind of raw dish, it is generally used to refer to &quot;saengseonhweh&quot; (생선회, raw fish dishes). It is dipped in &quot;gochujang&quot;, or soy sauce with wasabi, and served with lettuce or perilla leaves.

&quot;Jeon&quot; (or &quot;buchimgae&quot;) is a Korean savory pancake made from various ingredients. Chopped kimchi or seafood is mixed into a wheat flour-based batter, and then pan fried. This dish is typically dipped in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, and red pepper powder. It can be served as an appetizer, side dish (&quot;banchan&quot;) or accompanied by alcohol (&quot;anju&quot;).

There are some sweet varieties called Hwajeon () which means flower pancakes.

Cooking oils such as soy and corn are used today, though technology required for producing these oils was not available during the Joseon dynasty.
&quot;Namul&quot; may refer to either &quot;saengchae&quot; (생채, literally &quot;fresh vegetables&quot;) or &quot;sukchae&quot; (숙채, literally &quot;heated vegetables&quot;), although the term generally indicates the latter. &quot;Saengchae&quot; is mostly seasoned with vinegar, chili pepper powder and salt to give a tangy and refreshing taste. On the other hand, &quot;sukchae&quot; () is blanched and seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil, chopped garlic, or sometimes chili pepper powder.

===&quot;Anju&quot; (side dishes accompanying alcoholic beverages)===

Anju is a general term for a Korean side dish consumed with alcohol. It matches well with Korean traditional alcohol such as Soju or Makgeolli and helps people to enjoy their drinking more. Some examples of &quot;anju&quot; include steamed squid with &quot;gochujang&quot;, assorted fruit, &quot;dubu kimchi&quot; (tofu with kimchi), peanuts, &quot;odeng&quot;/&quot;ohmuk&quot;, &quot;sora&quot; () (a kind of shellfish popular in street food tents), and &quot;nakji&quot; (small octopus) and Jokbal (pig&#x27;s leg served with salted shrimp sauce). Samgyupsal (pork belly) is also considered as Anju with Soju. Most Korean foods can be considered as &#x27;anju&#x27;, as the food consumed alongside the alcohol depends on the diner&#x27;s taste and preferences.

== Holiday food ==

=== &quot;Songpyeon&quot; ===

&quot;Songpyeon&quot; is a Korean dish made of rice powder mostly eaten during Chuseok to express gratitude towards ancestors. Songpyeon recordings appear from the 17th century. It is said in 『Yorok 要 錄』, &quot;Make rice cakes with white rice flour, steam them with pine and pine needles and wash them off with water.&quot; At the beginning of Songpyeon, rice cakes were made simply with white rice powder, pine needles were steamed and then washed in water. It is said that &quot;red beans, pine nuts, walnuts, ginger and cinnamon&quot; were added in the &quot;Buyin Pilji 婦人 必 知&quot;. In 『Korean Rice Cakes, Hangwa, Eumcheongryu』, &quot;In mountainous regions such as Gangwon-do and Chungcheong-do, potato songpyeon, acorn songpyeon and songgisongpyeon have been prepared and eaten. In the coastal areas of Hamgyeong-do, Pyeongan-do and Gyeonggi-do, shellfish songpyeon as produced and eaten, and in the southern regions of Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do, songpyeon with moss leaves was produced and eaten.

=== &quot;Ogok-bap&quot; ===

&quot;Ogok-bap&quot; means five rice dish, which consists of rice mixed with glutinous rice, cornstarch, red bean, perilla, and soybean. By consuming grains with the energy of blue, red, yellow, white, and black, we pray for good health as well as a good year for our body with the energy of the five elements, and to chase away bad luck and happiness and well-being.

==Beverages==

===Non-alcoholic beverages===

All Korean traditional nonalcoholic beverages are referred to as &quot;eumcheong&quot; or &quot;eumcheongnyu&quot; (음청류 ) which literally means &quot;clear beverages&quot;. According to historical documents regarding Korean cuisine, 193 items of &quot;eumcheongnyu&quot; are recorded. &quot;Eumcheongnyu&quot; can be divided into the following categories: &quot;tea&quot;, &quot;hwachae&quot; (fruit punch), &quot;sikhye&quot; (sweet rice drink), &quot;sujeonggwa&quot; (persimmon punch), &quot;tang&quot; (탕, boiled water), &quot;jang&quot; (장, fermented grain juice with a sour taste), &quot;suksu&quot; (숙수, beverage made of herbs), &quot;galsu&quot; (갈수, drink made of fruit extract, and Oriental medicine), honeyed water, juice and milk by their ingredient materials and preparation methods. Among the varieties, tea, &quot;hwachae&quot;, &quot;sikhye&quot;, and &quot;sujeonggwa&quot; are still widely favored and consumed; however, the others almost disappeared by the end of the 20th century.

In Korean cuisine, tea, or &quot;cha&quot;, refers to various types of herbal tea that can be served hot or cold. Not necessarily related to the leaves, leaf buds, and internodes of the &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; plant, they are made from diverse substances, including fruits (e.g. &quot;yuja-cha&quot;), flowers (e.g. &quot;gukhwa-cha&quot;), leaves, roots, and grains (e.g. &quot;bori-cha&quot;, &quot;hyeonmi-cha&quot;) or herbs and substances used in traditional Korean medicine, such as ginseng (e.g. &quot;insam-cha&quot;) and ginger (e.g. &quot;saenggang-cha&quot;).

===Alcoholic beverages===

While &quot;soju&quot; is the best known liquor, there are well over 100 different alcoholic beverages, such as beers, rice and fruit wines, and liquors produced in South Korea as well as a sweet rice drink. The top-selling domestic beers (&quot;maekju&quot; in Korean) are lagers, which differ from Western beers in that they are brewed from rice, rather than barley. Consequently, Korean beers are lighter, sweeter and have less head than their Western counterparts. The South Korean beer market is dominated by the two major breweries: Hite and OB. Taedonggang is a North Korean beer produced at a brewery based in Pyongyang since 2002. Microbrewery beers and bars are growing in popularity after 2002.

&quot;Soju&quot; is a clear spirit which was originally made from grain, especially rice, and is now also made from sweet potatoes or barley. &quot;Soju&quot; made from grain is considered superior (as is also the case with grain vs. potato vodka). &quot;Soju&quot; is around 22% ABV, and is a favorite beverage of hard-up college students, hard-drinking businessmen, and blue-collar workers.

&quot;Yakju&quot; is a refined pure liquor fermented from rice, with the best known being &quot;cheongju&quot;. &quot;Takju&quot; is a thick unrefined liquor made with grains, with the best known being &quot;makgeolli&quot;, a white, milky rice wine traditionally drunk by farmers.

In addition to the rice wine, various fruit wines and herbal wines exist in Korean cuisine. Acacia, &quot;maesil&quot; plum, Chinese quince, cherry, pine cone, and pomegranate are most popular. &quot;Majuang wine&quot; (a blended wine of Korean grapes with French or American wines) and ginseng-based wines are also available.

==Sweets==

Traditional rice cakes, &quot;tteok&quot; and Korean confectionery &quot;hangwa&quot; are eaten as treats during holidays and festivals. &quot;Tteok&quot; refers to all kinds of rice cakes made from either pounded rice (메떡, &quot;metteok&quot;), pounded glutinous rice (찰떡, &quot;chaltteok&quot;), or glutinous rice left whole, without pounding. It is served either filled or covered with sweetened mung bean paste, red bean paste, mashed red beans, raisins, a sweetened filling made with sesame seeds, sweet pumpkin, beans, jujubes, pine nuts or honey). &quot;Tteok&quot; is usually served as dessert or as a snack. Among varieties, &quot;songpyeon&quot; is a chewy stuffed &quot;tteok&quot; served at &quot;Chuseok&quot;. Honey or another soft sweet material such as sweetened sesame or black beans are used as fillings. Pine needles can be used for imparting flavor during the steaming process. &quot;Yaksik&quot; is a sweet rice cake made with glutinous rice, chestnuts, pine nuts, jujubes, and other ingredients, while &quot;chapssaltteok&quot; is a &quot;tteok&quot; filled with sweet bean paste.

On the other hand, &quot;hangwa&quot; is a general term referring to all types of Korean traditional confectionery. The ingredients of &quot;hahngwa&quot; mainly consist of grain flour, honey, &quot;yeot&quot;, and sugar, or of fruit and edible roots. &quot;Hangwa&quot; is largely divided into &quot;yumilgwa&quot; (fried confectionery), &quot;suksilgwa&quot;, &quot;jeonggwa&quot;, &quot;gwapyeon&quot;, &quot;dasik&quot; (tea food) and &quot;yeot&quot;. &quot;Yumilgwa&quot; is made by stir frying or frying pieces of dough, such as &quot;maejakgwa&quot; and &quot;yakgwa&quot;. &quot;Maejakgwa&quot; is a ring-shaped confection made of wheat flour, vegetable oil, cinnamon, ginger juice, &quot;jocheong&quot;, and pine nuts, while &quot;yakgwa&quot;, literally &quot;medicinal confectionery&quot;, is a flower-shaped biscuit made of honey, sesame oil and wheat flour.

&quot;Suksilgwa&quot; is made by boiling fruits, ginger, or nuts in water, and then forming the mix into the original fruit&#x27;s shape, or other shapes. &quot;Gwapyeon&quot; is a jelly-like confection made by boiling sour fruits, starch, and sugar. &quot;Dasik&quot;, literally &quot;eatery for tea&quot;, is made by kneading rice flour, honey, and various types of flour from nuts, herbs, sesame, or jujubes. &quot;Jeonggwa&quot;, or &quot;jeongwa&quot;, is made by boiling fruits, plant roots and seeds in honey, mullyeot (&quot;물엿&quot;, liquid candy) or sugar. It is similar to marmalade or jam/jelly. &quot;Yeot&quot; is a Korean traditional candy in liquid or solid form made from steamed rice, glutinous rice, glutinous kaoliang, corn, sweet potatoes or mixed grains. The steamed ingredients are lightly fermented and boiled in a large pot called &quot;sot&quot; () for a long time.

&quot;Yugwa&quot; and Yakgwa. They are traditional desserts enjoyed during Chuseok, marriage or the sixtieth birthday.

==Regional and variant cuisines==
Korean regional cuisines () are characterized by local specialties and distinctive styles within Korean cuisine. The divisions reflected historical boundaries of the provinces where these food and culinary traditions were preserved until modern times.

Although Korea has been divided into two nation-states since 1948 (North Korea and South Korea), it was once divided into eight provinces (&quot;paldo&quot;) according to the Joseon administrative districts. The northern region consisted of Hamgyeong Province, Pyeongan Province and Hwanghae Province. The central region comprised Gyeonggi Province, Chungcheong Province, and Gangwon Province. Gyeongsang Province and Jeolla Province Province made up the southern region.

Until the late 19th century, transportation networks were not well developed, and each provincial region preserved its own characteristic tastes and cooking methods. Geographic differences are also reflected by the local specialty foodstuffs depending on the climate and types of agriculture, as well as the natural foods available. With the modern development of transportation and the introduction of foreign foods, Korean regional cuisines have tended to overlap and integrate. However, many unique traditional dishes in Korean regional cuisine have been handed down through the generations.

===Buddhist cuisine===
Korean temple cuisine originated in Buddhist temples of Korea. Since Buddhism was introduced into Korea, Buddhist traditions have strongly influenced Korean cuisine, as well. During the Silla period (57 BCE – 935 CE), &quot;chalbap&quot; (찰밥, a bowl of cooked glutinous rice) &quot;yakgwa&quot; (a fried dessert) and &quot;yumilgwa&quot; (a fried and puffed rice snack) were served for Buddhist altars and have been developed into types of &quot;hangwa&quot;, Korean traditional confectionery. During the Goryeo period, &quot;sangchu ssam&quot; (wraps made with lettuce), &quot;yaksik&quot;, and &quot;yakgwa&quot; were developed, and since spread to China and other countries. Since the Joseon dynasty, Buddhist cuisine has been established in Korea according to regions and temples.

On the other hand, royal court cuisine is closely related to Korean temple cuisine. In the past, when the royal court maids, &quot;sanggung&quot;, who were assigned to &quot;Suragan&quot; (; the name of the royal kitchen), where they prepared the king&#x27;s meals, became old, they had to leave the royal palace. Therefore, many of them entered Buddhist temples to become nuns. As a result, culinary techniques and recipes of the royal cuisine were integrated into Buddhist cuisine.

===Vegetarian cuisine===

Vegetarian cookery in Korea may be linked to the Buddhist traditions that influenced Korean culture from the Goryeo dynasty onwards. There are hundreds of vegetarian restaurants in Korea, although historically they have been local restaurants that are unknown to tourists. Most have buffets, with cold food, and vegetarian kimchi and tofu being the main features. &quot;Bibimbap&quot; is a common vegan dish. Menus change with seasons. Wine with the alcohol removed and fine teas are also served. The Korean tea ceremony is suitable for all vegetarians and vegans, and began with Buddhist influences. All food is eaten with a combination of stainless steel oval chopsticks and a long-handled shallow spoon called together &quot;sujeo&quot;.

===Ceremonial food===

Food is an important part of traditions of Korean family ceremonies, which are mainly based on the Confucian culture. Gwan Hon Sang Je (), the four family ceremonies (coming-of-age ceremony, wedding, funeral, and ancestral rite) have been considered especially important and elaborately developed, continuing to influence Korean life to these days. Ceremonial food in Korea has developed with variation across different regions and cultures.

For example, ancestral rites called &quot;jesa&quot; are mainly held on the anniversary of an ancestor&#x27;s death. Ritual food includes rice, rice cakes, meat and fish, alcohol, and fruit. 

===Street food===


In South Korea, inexpensive food may be purchased from &quot;pojangmacha&quot;, street carts during the day, where customers may eat standing beside the cart or have their food wrapped up to take home. At night, &quot;pojangmacha&quot; () become small tents that sell food, drinks, and alcoholic beverages.

Seasonal street foods include &quot;hotteok&quot; and &quot;bungeoppang&quot;, which are enjoyed in autumn and winter. &quot;Gyeran-ppang&quot; and &quot;hoppang&quot; are also enjoyed in winter. 

Other common street foods include &quot;gimbap&quot; (), &quot;tteokbokki&quot; (), &quot;sundae&quot;, &quot;twigim&quot;, and &quot;eomuk&quot;. &quot;Dak-kkochi&quot; (), or skewered chicken grilled in various sauces, is also popular. &quot;Beondegi&quot; () and &quot;dalgona/ppopgi&quot; () are two examples of original street foods many people have enjoyed since childhood. 

==Etiquette==

===Dining===
Dining etiquette in Korea can be traced back to the Confucian philosophies of the Joseon period. Guidebooks, such as &quot;Sasojeol&quot; (士小節, &quot;Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families&quot;), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (), comment on the dining etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as &quot;when you see a fat cow, goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it&quot;, &quot;when you are having a meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or diarrhea,&quot; &quot;when eating a meal, neither eat so slowly as to appear to be eating against your will nor so fast as if to be taking someone else&#x27;s food. Do not throw chopsticks on the table. Spoons should not touch plates, making a clashing sound&quot;, among many other recommendations which emphasized proper table etiquette.

Other than the etiquette mentioned above, blowing one&#x27;s nose when having a meal is considered an inappropriate act as well.

The eldest male at the table was always served first, and was commonly served in the men&#x27;s quarters by the women of the house. Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.

In Korea, unlike in other East Asian cuisines such as Chinese and Japanese, the rice or soup bowl is not lifted from the table when eating from it. This is due to the fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as sujeo. The use of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. There are rules which reflect the decorum of sharing communal side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table. Diners should also cover their mouths when using a toothpick after the meal.

The table setup is important as well, and individual place settings, moving from the diner&#x27;s left should be as follows: rice bowl, spoon, then chopsticks. Hot foods are set to the right side of the table, with the cold foods to the left. Soup must remain on the right side of the diner along with stews. Vegetables remain on the left along with the rice, and kimchi is set to the back while sauces remain in the front.

===Drinking===
The manner of drinking alcoholic drinks while dining is significant in Korean dining etiquette. Each diner is expected to face away from the eldest male and cover his mouth when drinking alcohol.
According to Hyang Eum Ju Rye (), the drinking etiquette established in Choseon dynasty, it is impolite for a king and his vassal, a father and his son, or a teacher and his student to drink face to face. Also, a guest should not refuse the first drink offered by host, and in the most formal situations, the diner should politely twice refuse a drink offered by the eldest male or a host. When the host offers for the third time, then finally the guest can receive it. If the guest refuses three times, drink is not to be offered any more.

==Royal court cuisine==

Collectively known as &quot;gungjung eumsik&quot; during the pre-modern era, the foods of the royal palace were reflective of the opulent nature of the past rulers of the Korean peninsula. This nature is evidenced in examples as far back as the Silla kingdom, where a man-made lake (Anapji Lake, located in Gyeongju), was created with multiple pavilions and halls for the sole purpose of opulent banquets, and a spring fed channel, Poseokjeong, was created for the singular purpose of setting wine cups afloat while they wrote poems.

Reflecting the regionalism of the kingdoms and bordering countries of the peninsula, the cuisine borrowed portions from each of these areas to exist as a showcase. The royalty would have the finest regional specialties and delicacies sent to them at the palace. Although there are records of banquets predating the Joseon period, the majority of these records mostly reflect the vast variety of foods, but do not mention the specific foods presented. The meals cooked for the royal family did not reflect the seasons, as the commoner&#x27;s meals would have. Instead, their meals varied significantly day-to-day. Each of the eight provinces was represented each month in the royal palace by ingredients presented by their governors, which gave the cooks a wide assortment of ingredients to use for royal meals.
Food was considered significant in the Joseon period. Official positions were created within the Six Ministries (&quot;Yukjo&quot;, 육조) that were charged with all matters related to procurement and consumption of food and drink for the royal court. The Board of Personnel (&quot;Ijo&quot;, 이조) contained positions specific for attaining rice for the royal family. The Board of Rights (&quot;Yejo&quot;) were responsible for foods prepared for ancestor rites, attaining wines and other beverages, and medicinal foods. There were also hundreds of slaves and women who worked in the palace that had tasks such as making tofu, liquor, tea, and &quot;tteok&quot; (rice cakes). The women were the cooks to the royal palace and were of commoner or low-born families. These women would be split into specific skill sets or &quot;bureau&quot; such as the bureau of special foods (&quot;Saenggwa-bang&quot;, 생과방) or the bureau of cooking foods (&quot;Soju-bang&quot;, 소주방). These female cooks may have been assisted by male cooks from outside the palace during larger banquets when necessary.

Five meals were generally served in the royal palace each day during the Joseon period, and records suggest this pattern had existed from antiquity. Three of these meals would be full meals, while the afternoon and after dinner meals would be lighter. The first meal, &quot;mieumsang&quot; (), was served at sunrise and was served only on days when the king and queen were not taking herbal medicines. The meal consisted of rice porridge (&quot;juk&quot;, 죽) made with ingredients such as abalone (&quot;jeonbokjuk&quot;), white rice (&quot;huinjuk&quot;), mushrooms (&quot;beoseotjuk&quot;), pine nuts (&quot;jatjuk&quot;), and sesame (&quot;kkaejuk&quot;). The side dishes could consist of &quot;kimchi&quot;, &quot;nabak kimchi&quot;, oysters, soy sauce, and other items. The porridge was thought to give vitality to the king and queen throughout the day.

The &quot;sura&quot; () were the main meals of the day. Breakfast was served at ten in the morning, and the evening meals were served between six and seven at night. The set of three tables (&quot;surasang&quot;, 수라상), were usually set with two types of rice, two types of soup, two types of stew (&quot;jjigae&quot;), one dish of &quot;jjim&quot; (meat stew), one dish of &quot;jeongol&quot; (a casserole of meat and vegetables), three types of &quot;kimchi&quot;, three types of &quot;jang&quot; () and twelve side dishes, called 12 cheop (12첩). The meals were set in the &quot;suragan&quot; (), a room specifically used for taking meals, with the king seated to the east and the queen to the west. Each had their own set of tables and were attended by three palace servant women known as &quot;sura sanggung&quot; (). These women would remove bowl covers and offer the foods to the king and queen after ensuring the dishes were not poisoned.

Banquets () were held on special occasions in the Korean Royal Palace. These included birthdays of the royal family members, marriages, and national festivals, including Daeborum, Dano, Chuseok, and Dongji. Banquet food was served on individual tables which varied according to the rank of the person. Usually banquet food consisted of ten different types of dishes. Main dishes were prepared based on the seasonal foods. Main dishes of the banquet included &quot;sinseollo&quot;, &quot;jeon&quot;, &quot;hwayang jeok&quot;, &quot;honghapcho&quot;, &quot;nengmyun&quot; and &quot;mulgimchi&quot;. A typical banquet ingredient was &quot;chogyetang&quot; (chicken broth with vinegar), which was prepared with five different chickens, five abalones, ten sea cucumbers, twenty eggs, half a bellflower root, mushrooms, two cups of black pepper, two peeled pine nuts, starch, soy sauce and vinegar. &quot;Yaksik&quot; was a favorite banquet dessert.

== Health effects ==
Traditional Korean diet or Hansik is often associated with spiritual and physical health. While the diet of modern Korean people has become increasingly westernized and consists of numerous non-traditional foods, many believe in the healing power of Hansik. Vegetables and fermented foods are part of a healthy diet around the world, and Hansik includes many vegetable dishes and fermented foods. Three dishes, soup, Kimchi and multigrain rice make up the basic meal pattern of Hansik called three Cheopbansang. Fermented soybean paste Doenjang used in soups and fermented red chili paste Gochujang used in kimchi add health benefits to these foods.

Certain foods are typically consumed to combat the heat of the summer or the cold months, regain strength during and after an illness, or for general health. Cool noodle Naengmyeon originally from the northern part of the Korean peninsula is now enjoyed in South Korea as well as many parts of the world especially during the hot summer months. Likewise, ginseng chicken soup Samgyetang is often eaten during summer to reduce heat exhaustion and regain stamina.

Following a traditional Korean diet may lower the risk of some health issues including obesity and metabolic syndrome with a decrease in body mass index (BMI), body fat percent, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Fermented foods like kimchi and doenjang contain probiotics which may boost immunity and reduce the incidence or severity of allergic conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. It may also lower the risk of cardiovascular and chronic metabolic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.

Probiotics typically found in kimchi include species of genera &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, &quot;Leuconostoc&quot;, and &quot;Weissella&quot;, and they have been linked to anti-inflammatory effects and health benefits such as improved gut health. Napa cabbage is prepared with much salt and approximately 20% of sodium intake comes from kimchi. An increased risk of gastric cancer among subjects with frequent or high consumption of kimchi was found in some case-control studies. As with other salted foods, moderate consumption may maximize health benefits of kimchi.

<doc id="16794" wikidata="Q79726" url="?curid=16794" title="Kilobyte">
<text>The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. A &quot;kilobyte&quot; may refer to either 1000 or 1024 bytes.

* The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix &quot;kilo&quot; as a multiplication factor of 1000 (103); therefore, one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The internationally recommended unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB.
* However, in some areas of information technology, particularly in reference to random-access memory capacity, &quot;kilobyte&quot; instead typically refers to 1024 (210) bytes. This arises from the prevalence of sizes that are powers of two in modern digital memory architectures, coupled with the coincidence that 210 differs from 103 by less than 2.5%. 

The term kibibyte always refers to 1024 bytes, avoiding the ambiguity issues of the &quot;kilobyte&quot;.
==Definitions and usage==
===Decimal (1000 bytes)===
In the International System of Units (SI) the metric prefix &quot;kilo&quot; means 1,000 (103); therefore, one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol is kB.

This is the definition standardised by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This definition, and the related definitions of the prefixes mega (), giga (), etc., are most commonly used for data transfer rates in computer networks, internal bus, hard drive and flash media transfer speeds, and for the capacities of most storage media, particularly hard disk drives, flash-based storage, and DVDs. It is also consistent with the other uses of the metric prefixes in computing, such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance.

The international standard IEC 80000-13 uses the term &quot;byte&quot; to mean eight bits (1 B = 8 bit). Therefore, 1 kB = 8000 bit. One thousand kilobytes (1000 kB) is equal to one megabyte (1 MB), where 1 MB is one million bytes.

===Binary (1024 bytes)===
The term &#x27;kilobyte&#x27; has traditionally been used to refer to 1024 bytes (210 B). The usage of the metric prefix &quot;kilo&quot; for binary multiples arose as a convenience, because 1024 is approximately 1000.

The binary interpretation of metric prefixes is still prominently used by the Microsoft Windows operating system. Binary interpretation is also used for random-access memory capacity, such as main memory and CPU cache size, due to the prevalent binary addressing of memory.

The binary meaning of the kilobyte for 1024 bytes typically uses the symbol KB, with an uppercase letter &quot;K&quot;. The &quot;B&quot; is sometimes omitted in informal use. For example, a processor with 65,536 bytes of cache memory might be said to have &quot;64 K&quot; of cache. In this convention, one thousand and twenty-four kilobytes (1024 KB) is equal to one megabyte (1 MB), where 1 MB is 10242 bytes.

In December 1998, the IEC addressed such multiple usages and definitions by creating prefixes such as kibi, mebi, gibi, etc., to unambiguously denote powers of 1024. Thus the kibibyte, symbol KiB, represents 210 bytes = 1024 bytes. These prefixes are now part of IEC 80000-13. The IEC further specified that the kilobyte should only be used to refer to 1000 bytes. The International System of Units restricts the use of the SI prefixes strictly to powers of 10.

==Use of term==
* The Shugart SA-400 5-inch floppy disk (1976) held 109,375 bytes unformatted, and was advertised as &quot;110 Kbyte&quot;, using the 1000 convention. Likewise, the 8-inch DEC RX01 floppy (1975) held 256,256 bytes formatted, and was advertised as &quot;256k&quot;. On the other hand, the Tandon 5-inch DD floppy format (1978) held 368,640 (which is 360×1024) bytes, but was advertised as &quot;360 KB&quot;, following the 1024 convention.
* Early home computer systems would often advertise using the 1024 convention, hence the naming of the Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and the Amstrad CPC 464.
* On modern systems, all versions of Microsoft Windows including the newest () Windows 10 divide by 1024 and represent a 65,536-byte file as &quot;64 KB&quot;. Conversely, Mac OS X Snow Leopard and newer represent this as 66 kB, rounding to the nearest 1000 bytes. File sizes are reported with decimal prefixes.
* the binary interpretation was still used in marketing and billing by some telecommunication companies, such as Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Orange and Telstra.

== Data examples ==
 &quot;This is an example of a text which is exactly a kilobyte (kB) large. In this case, this text is 10^3 bytes long, but if you were to add 24 extra characters to this string, it would be 2^10 bytes long, which is used in some fields such as information technology. Each character in this string (which includes the quotation marks at the end, by the way) is exactly one byte long, which is 8 bits. The bit is the fundamental unit of information, which represents a single yes or no. So, one could measure the amount of information in a single letter with 5 bits (because 2^5 is 32, there are 26 letters in the English language), but because we also use other characters, like numbers, capital/lowercase letters, symbols (like {}$#*&amp;%!`~), spaces, and more. In a computer&#x27;s memory, these may be represented with some binary string, such as 01010100 (which represents the letter T), usually this is distinguished from one million ten thousand one hundred by appending &#x27;0b&#x27; to the front, like 0b01010100.&quot;
* The Lord&#x27;s Prayer, in Latin, is 296 bytes.
* The short story &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe, hosted on Project Gutenberg as an uncompressed plain text file, is 12,843 bytes: this is 12.8 kilobytes (divided by 1,000) or 12.5 kibibytes (divided by 1,024).

* The novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, by Oscar Wilde, hosted on Project Gutenberg as an uncompressed plain text file, is 428,952 bytes; this is 428.95 kilobytes (divided by 1,000) and 418.90 kibibytes (divided by 1,024). &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is 994,639 bytes, and &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is 1,191,763 bytes.

<text>Karl Andree (20 October 1808 – 10 August 1875) was a German geographer, publicist and consul.

==Biography==
Andree was born in Braunschweig. He was educated at Jena, Göttingen, and Berlin in historical science. After having been implicated in a students&#x27; political agitation he became a journalist, and in 1851 founded the newspaper &quot;Bremer Handelsblatt&quot;. From 1855, however, he devoted himself entirely to geography and ethnography, working successively at Leipzig and at Dresden. During the American Civil War, he advocated the cause of the secessionists. In 1862 he founded the important geographical periodical &quot;Globus&quot;. He died at Wildungen. His son Richard Andree followed in his father&#x27;s career.

==Works==
His most famous works include &quot;North America in geographical and historical outline&quot; (&quot;Nordamerika in geographischen und geschichtlichen Umrissen&quot;) (Brunswick, 1854) or &quot;Buenos Aires and the Argentinian Republic&quot; (&quot;Buenos Ayres und die argentinische Republik&quot;) (Leipzig, 1856). In &quot;Geographic Migrations&quot; (&quot;Geographische Wanderungen&quot;) (Dresden, 1859), he put emphasis on ethnological moments and argued that ethnology should be considered a main foundational point of political science. He understood the term &quot;ethnology&quot; (German: &quot;Völkerkunde&quot;) to be defined as concerning racial anthropology and not as comparative cultural anthropology.

<doc id="16796" wikidata="Q427" url="?curid=16796" title="Kuiper belt">
<text>The Kuiper belt ( ) is a circumstellar disc in the outer Solar System, extending from the orbit of Neptune at 30 astronomical units (AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is far larger—20 times as wide and 20–200 times as massive. Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from when the Solar System formed. While many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed &quot;ices&quot;), such as methane, ammonia, and water. The Kuiper belt is home to most of the objects that astronomers generally accept as dwarf planets: Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake. Some of the Solar System&#x27;s moons, such as Neptune&#x27;s Triton and Saturn&#x27;s Phoebe, may have originated in the region.

The Kuiper belt is named in honor of the Dutch astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who conjectured the existence of the belt in 1951. There were researchers before and after him who also speculated on its existence, such as Kenneth Edgeworth in the 1930s. The astronomer Julio Angel Fernandez published a paper in 1980 suggesting the existence of a comet belt beyond Neptune which could serve as a source for short-period comets.

In 1992, minor planet (15760) Albion was discovered, the first Kuiper belt object (KBO) since Pluto (in 1930) and Charon (in 1978). Since its discovery, the number of known KBOs has increased to thousands, and more than 100,000 KBOs over in diameter are thought to exist. The Kuiper belt was initially thought to be the main repository for periodic comets, those with orbits lasting less than 200 years. Studies since the mid-1990s have shown that the belt is dynamically stable and that comets&#x27; true place of origin is the scattered disc, a dynamically active zone created by the outward motion of Neptune 4.5 billion years ago; scattered disc objects such as Eris have extremely eccentric orbits that take them as far as 100 AU from the Sun.

The Kuiper belt is distinct from the hypothesized Oort cloud, which is believed to be a thousand times more distant and mostly spherical. The objects within the Kuiper belt, together with the members of the scattered disc and any potential Hills cloud or Oort cloud objects, are collectively referred to as trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Pluto is the largest and most massive member of the Kuiper belt and the largest and the second-most-massive known TNO, surpassed only by Eris in the scattered disc. Originally considered a planet, Pluto&#x27;s status as part of the Kuiper belt caused it to be reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. It is compositionally similar to many other objects of the Kuiper belt, and its orbital period is characteristic of a class of KBOs, known as &quot;plutinos,&quot; that share the same 2:3 resonance with Neptune.

The Kuiper belt and Neptune may be treated as a marker of the extent of the Solar System, alternatives being the heliopause and the distance at which the Sun&#x27;s gravitational influence is matched by that of other stars (estimated to be between and ).

== History ==
After the discovery of Pluto in 1930, many speculated that it might not be alone. The region now called the Kuiper belt was hypothesized in various forms for decades. It was only in 1992 that the first direct evidence for its existence was found. The number and variety of prior speculations on the nature of the Kuiper belt have led to continued uncertainty as to who deserves credit for first proposing it.

=== Hypotheses ===
The first astronomer to suggest the existence of a trans-Neptunian population was Frederick C. Leonard. Soon after Pluto&#x27;s discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Leonard pondered whether it was &quot;likely that in Pluto there has come to light the &quot;first&quot; of a &quot;series&quot; of ultra-Neptunian bodies, the remaining members of which still await discovery but which are destined eventually to be detected&quot;. That same year, astronomer Armin O. Leuschner suggested that Pluto &quot;may be one of many long-period planetary objects yet to be discovered.&quot;

In 1943, in the &quot;Journal of the British Astronomical Association&quot;, Kenneth Edgeworth hypothesized that, in the region beyond Neptune, the material within the primordial solar nebula was too widely spaced to condense into planets, and so rather condensed into a myriad smaller bodies. From this he concluded that &quot;the outer region of the solar system, beyond the orbits of the planets, is occupied by a very large number of comparatively small bodies&quot; and that, from time to time, one of their number &quot;wanders from its own sphere and appears as an occasional visitor to the inner solar system&quot;, becoming a comet.

In 1951, in a paper in &quot;Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium&quot;, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System&#x27;s evolution and concluded that the disc consisted of &quot;remnants of original clusterings which have lost many members that became stray asteroids, much as has occurred with open galactic clusters dissolving into stars.&quot; In another paper, based upon a lecture Kuiper gave in 1950, also called &quot;On the Origin of the Solar System&quot;, Kuiper wrote about the &quot;outermost region of the solar nebula, from 38 to 50 astr. units (i.e., just outside proto-Neptune)&quot; where &quot;condensation products (ices of H20, NH3, CH4, etc.) must have formed, and the flakes must have slowly collected and formed larger aggregates, estimated to range up to 1 km. or more in size.&quot; He continued to write that &quot;these condensations appear to account for the comets, in size, number and composition.&quot; According to Kuiper &quot;the planet Pluto, which sweeps through the whole zone from 30 to 50 astr. units, is held responsible for having started the scattering of the comets throughout the solar system.&quot; It is said that Kuiper was operating on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto was the size of Earth and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System; there would not be a Kuiper belt today if this were correct.

The hypothesis took many other forms in the following decades. In 1962, physicist Al G.W. Cameron postulated the existence of &quot;a tremendous mass of small material on the outskirts of the solar system&quot;. In 1964, Fred Whipple, who popularised the famous &quot;dirty snowball&quot; hypothesis for cometary structure, thought that a &quot;comet belt&quot; might be massive enough to cause the purported discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus that had sparked the search for Planet X, or, at the very least, massive enough to affect the orbits of known comets. Observation ruled out this hypothesis.

In 1977, Charles Kowal discovered 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with an orbit between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, was discovered in a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known to exist in the region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs&#x27; orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron&#x27;s discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.

Further evidence for the existence of the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. A proposal for such an area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, possibly a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.There is another comet population, known as short-period or periodic comets, consisting of those comets that, like Halley&#x27;s Comet, have orbital periods of less than 200 years. By the 1970s, the rate at which short-period comets were being discovered was becoming increasingly inconsistent with their having emerged solely from the Oort cloud. For an Oort cloud object to become a short-period comet, it would first have to be captured by the giant planets. In a paper published in &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; in 1980, Uruguayan astronomer Julio Fernández stated that for every short-period comet to be sent into the inner Solar System from the Oort cloud, 600 would have to be ejected into interstellar space. He speculated that a comet belt from between 35 and 50 AU would be required to account for the observed number of comets. Following up on Fernández&#x27;s work, in 1988 the Canadian team of Martin Duncan, Tom Quinn and Scott Tremaine ran a number of computer simulations to determine if all observed comets could have arrived from the Oort cloud. They found that the Oort cloud could not account for all short-period comets, particularly as short-period comets are clustered near the plane of the Solar System, whereas Oort-cloud comets tend to arrive from any point in the sky. With a &quot;belt&quot;, as Fernández described it, added to the formulations, the simulations matched observations. Reportedly because the words &quot;Kuiper&quot; and &quot;comet belt&quot; appeared in the opening sentence of Fernández&#x27;s paper, Tremaine named this hypothetical region the &quot;Kuiper belt&quot;.

=== Discovery ===

In 1987, astronomer David Jewitt, then at MIT, became increasingly puzzled by &quot;the apparent emptiness of the outer Solar System&quot;. He encouraged then-graduate student Jane Luu to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object beyond Pluto&#x27;s orbit, because, as he told her, &quot;If we don&#x27;t, nobody will.&quot; Using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Jewitt and Luu conducted their search in much the same way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had, with a blink comparator. Initially, examination of each pair of plates took about eight hours, but the process was sped up with the arrival of electronic charge-coupled devices or CCDs, which, though their field of view was narrower, were not only more efficient at collecting light (they retained 90% of the light that hit them, rather than the 10% achieved by photographs) but allowed the blinking process to be done virtually, on a computer screen. Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical detectors. In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Luu later joined him to work at the University of Hawaii&#x27;s 2.24 m telescope at Mauna Kea. Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly. Finally, after five years of searching, Jewitt and Luu announced on 30 August 1992 the &quot;Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object 1992 QB1&quot;. This object would later be named 15760 Albion. Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, (181708) 1993 FW. By 2018, over 2000 Kuiper belts objects had been discovered.

Over one thousand bodies were found in a belt in the twenty years (1992–2012), after finding (named in 2018, 15760 Albion), showing a vast belt of bodies in addition to Pluto and Albion. Even in the 2010s the full extent and nature of Kuiper belt bodies was largely unknown. Finally, the unmanned spacecraft New Horizons conducted the first KBO flybys, providing much closer observations of the Plutonian system (2015) and then Arrokoth (2019).

Studies conducted since the trans-Neptunian region was first charted have shown that the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.

=== Name ===
Astronomers sometimes use the alternative name Edgeworth–Kuiper belt to credit Edgeworth, and KBOs are occasionally referred to as EKOs. Brian G. Marsden claims that neither deserves true credit: &quot;Neither Edgeworth nor Kuiper wrote about anything remotely like what we are now seeing, but Fred Whipple did&quot;. David Jewitt comments: &quot;If anything ... Fernández most nearly deserves the credit for predicting the Kuiper Belt.&quot;

KBOs are sometimes called &quot;kuiperoids&quot;, a name suggested by Clyde Tombaugh. The term &quot;trans-Neptunian object&quot; (TNO) is recommended for objects in the belt by several scientific groups because the term is less controversial than all others—it is not an exact synonym though, as TNOs include all objects orbiting the Sun past the orbit of Neptune, not just those in the Kuiper belt.

== Structure ==
At its fullest extent (but excluding the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30–55 AU. The main body of the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.

The presence of Neptune has a profound effect on the Kuiper belt&#x27;s structure due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune&#x27;s gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects that happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.

=== Classical belt ===

Between the 2:3 and 1:2 resonances with Neptune, at approximately 42–48 AU, the gravitational interactions with Neptune occur over an extended timescale, and objects can exist with their orbits essentially unaltered. This region is known as the classical Kuiper belt, and its members comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date. Because the first modern KBO discovered (Albion, but long called (15760) 1992 QB1), is considered the prototype of this group, classical KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos (&quot;Q-B-1-os&quot;). The guidelines established by the IAU demand that classical KBOs be given names of mythological beings associated with creation.

The classical Kuiper belt appears to be a composite of two separate populations. The first, known as the &quot;dynamically cold&quot; population, has orbits much like the planets; nearly circular, with an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.1, and with relatively low inclinations up to about 10° (they lie close to the plane of the Solar System rather than at an angle). The cold population also contains a concentration of objects, referred to as the kernel, with semi-major axes at 44–44.5 AU. The second, the &quot;dynamically hot&quot; population, has orbits much more inclined to the ecliptic, by up to 30°. The two populations have been named this way not because of any major difference in temperature, but from analogy to particles in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they become heated up. Not only are the two populations in different orbits, the cold population also differs in color and albedo, being redder and brighter, has a larger fraction of binary objects, has a different size distribution, and lacks very large objects. The mass of the dynamically cold population is roughly 30 times less than the mass of the hot. The difference in colors may be a reflection of different compositions, which suggests they formed in different regions. The hot population is proposed to have formed near Neptune&#x27;s original orbit and to have been scattered out during the migration of the giant planets. The cold population, on the other hand, has been proposed to have formed more or less in its current position because the loose binaries would be unlikely to survive encounters with Neptune. Although the Nice model appears to be able to at least partially explain a compositional difference, it has also been suggested the color difference may reflect differences in surface evolution.

=== Resonances ===


When an object&#x27;s orbital period is an exact ratio of Neptune&#x27;s (a situation called a mean-motion resonance), then it can become locked in a synchronised motion with Neptune and avoid being perturbed away if their relative alignments are appropriate. If, for instance, an object orbits the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits, and if it reaches perihelion with Neptune a quarter of an orbit away from it, then whenever it returns to perihelion, Neptune will always be in about the same relative position as it began, because it will have completed orbits in the same time. This is known as the 2:3 (or 3:2) resonance, and it corresponds to a characteristic semi-major axis of about 39.4 AU. This 2:3 resonance is populated by about 200 known objects, including Pluto together with its moons. In recognition of this, the members of this family are known as plutinos. Many plutinos, including Pluto, have orbits that cross that of Neptune, although their resonance means they can never collide. Plutinos have high orbital eccentricities, suggesting that they are not native to their current positions but were instead thrown haphazardly into their orbits by the migrating Neptune. IAU guidelines dictate that all plutinos must, like Pluto, be named for underworld deities. The 1:2 resonance (whose objects complete half an orbit for each of Neptune&#x27;s) corresponds to semi-major axes of ~47.7 AU, and is sparsely populated. Its residents are sometimes referred to as twotinos. Other resonances also exist at 3:4, 3:5, 4:7, and 2:5. Neptune has a number of trojan objects, which occupy its Lagrangian points, gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing it in its orbit. Neptune trojans are in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune and often have very stable orbits.

Additionally, there is a relative absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently be explained by the present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.

=== Kuiper cliff ===
The 1:2 resonance at 47.8 AU appears to be an edge beyond which few objects are known. It is not clear whether it is actually the outer edge of the classical belt or just the beginning of a broad gap. Objects have been detected at the 2:5 resonance at roughly 55 AU, well outside the classical belt; predictions of a large number of bodies in classical orbits between these resonances have not been verified through observation.

Based on estimations of the primordial mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, as well as bodies as large as Pluto &quot;(see )&quot;, earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested that the number of large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50 AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the &quot;Kuiper cliff&quot;, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. Bernstein, Trilling, et al. (2003) found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100 km or more in radius beyond 50 AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible. An analysis of the TNO data available prior to September 2023 shows that the distribution of objects at the outer rim of the classical Kuiper belt resembles that of the outer main asteroid belt with a gap at about 72 AU, far from any mean-motion resonances with Neptune; the outer main asteroid belt exhibits a gap induced by the 5:6 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter at 5.875 AU.

== Origin ==
The precise origins of the Kuiper belt and its complex structure are still unclear, and astronomers are awaiting the completion of several wide-field survey telescopes such as Pan-STARRS and the future LSST, which should reveal many currently unknown KBOs. These surveys will provide data that will help determine answers to these questions. Pan-STARRS 1 finished its primary science mission in 2014, and the full data from the Pan-STARRS 1 surveys were published in 2019, helping reveal many more KBOs.

The Kuiper belt is thought to consist of planetesimals, fragments from the original protoplanetary disc around the Sun that failed to fully coalesce into planets and instead formed into smaller bodies, the largest less than in diameter. Studies of the crater counts on Pluto and Charon revealed a scarcity of small craters suggesting that such objects formed directly as sizeable objects in the range of tens of kilometers in diameter rather than being accreted from much smaller, roughly kilometer scale bodies. Hypothetical mechanisms for the formation of these larger bodies include the gravitational collapse of clouds of pebbles concentrated between eddies in a turbulent protoplanetary disk or in streaming instabilities. These collapsing clouds may fragment, forming binaries.

Modern computer simulations show the Kuiper belt to have been strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System&#x27;s history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted to the point where Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc.

While Neptune&#x27;s orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune&#x27;s 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune&#x27;s orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.

The original version of the currently most popular model, the &quot;Nice model&quot;, reproduces many characteristics of the Kuiper belt such as the &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;hot&quot; populations, resonant objects, and a scattered disc, but it still fails to account for some of the characteristics of their distributions. The model predicts a higher average eccentricity in classical KBO orbits than is observed (0.10–0.13 versus 0.07) and its predicted inclination distribution contains too few high inclination objects. In addition, the frequency of binary objects in the cold belt, many of which are far apart and loosely bound, also poses a problem for the model. These are predicted to have been separated during encounters with Neptune, leading some to propose that the cold disc formed at its current location, representing the only truly local population of small bodies in the solar system.

A recent modification of the Nice model has the Solar System begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, in a chain of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after the formation of the Solar System the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the Solar System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.

As in the original Nice model, objects are captured into resonances with Neptune during its outward migration. Some remain in the resonances, others evolve onto higher-inclination, lower-eccentricity orbits, and are released onto stable orbits forming the dynamically hot classical belt. The hot belt&#x27;s inclination distribution can be reproduced if Neptune migrated from 24 AU to 30 AU on a 30 Myr timescale. When Neptune migrates to 28 AU, it has a gravitational encounter with the extra ice giant. Objects captured from the cold belt into the 1:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune are left behind as a local concentration at 44 AU when this encounter causes Neptune&#x27;s semi-major axis to jump outward. The objects deposited in the cold belt include some loosely bound &#x27;blue&#x27; binaries originating from closer than the cold belt&#x27;s current location. If Neptune&#x27;s eccentricity remains small during this encounter, the chaotic evolution of orbits of the original Nice model is avoided and a primordial cold belt is preserved. In the later phases of Neptune&#x27;s migration, a slow sweeping of mean-motion resonances removes the higher-eccentricity objects from the cold belt, truncating its eccentricity distribution.

== Composition ==
Being distant from the Sun and major planets, Kuiper belt objects are thought to be relatively unaffected by the processes that have shaped and altered other Solar System objects; thus, determining their composition would provide substantial information on the makeup of the earliest Solar System. Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is spectroscopy. When an object&#x27;s light is broken into its component colors, an image akin to a rainbow is formed. This image is called a spectrum. Different substances absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called absorption lines) appear where the substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every element or compound has its own unique spectroscopic signature, and by reading an object&#x27;s full spectral &quot;fingerprint&quot;, astronomers can determine its composition.

Analysis indicates that Kuiper belt objects are composed of a mixture of rock and a variety of ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for only a small number of objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.

Initially, detailed analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed a broad range of colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed of a wide range of compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu&#x27;s spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.

Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due to their faintness, there have been a number of successes in determining their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.

The largest KBOs, such as Pluto and Quaoar, have surfaces rich in volatile compounds such as methane, nitrogen and carbon monoxide; the presence of these molecules is likely due to their moderate vapor pressure in the 30–50 K temperature range of the Kuiper belt. This allows them to occasionally boil off their surfaces and then fall again as snow, whereas compounds with higher boiling points would remain solid. The relative abundances of these three compounds in the largest KBOs is directly related to their surface gravity and ambient temperature, which determines which they can retain. Water ice has been detected in several KBOs, including members of the Haumea family such as , mid-sized objects such as 38628 Huya and 20000 Varuna, and also on some small objects. The presence of crystalline ice on large and mid-sized objects, including 50000 Quaoar where ammonia hydrate has also been detected, may indicate past tectonic activity aided by melting point lowering due to the presence of ammonia.

== Mass and size distribution ==

Despite its vast extent, the collective mass of the Kuiper belt is relatively low. The total mass of the dynamically hot population is estimated to be 1% the mass of the Earth. The dynamically cold population is estimated to be much smaller with only 0.03% the mass of the Earth. While the dynamically hot population is thought to be the remnant of a much larger population that formed closer to the Sun and was scattered outward during the migration of the giant planets, in contrast, the dynamically cold population is thought to have formed at its current location. The most recent estimate (2018) puts the total mass of the Kuiper belt at Earth masses based on the influence that it exerts on the motion of planets.

The small total mass of the dynamically cold population presents some problems for models of the Solar System&#x27;s formation because a sizable mass is required for accretion of KBOs larger than in diameter. If the cold classical Kuiper belt had always had its current low density, these large objects simply could not have formed by the collision and mergers of smaller planetesimals. Moreover, the eccentricity and inclination of current orbits make the encounters quite &quot;violent&quot; resulting in destruction rather than accretion. The removal of a large fraction of the mass of the dynamically cold population is thought to be unlikely. Neptune&#x27;s current influence is too weak to explain such a massive &quot;vacuuming&quot;, and the extent of mass loss by collisional grinding is limited by the presence of loosely bound binaries in the cold disk, which are likely to be disrupted in collisions. Instead of forming from the collisions of smaller planetesimals, the larger object may have formed directly from the collapse of clouds of pebbles.
The size distributions of the Kuiper belt objects follow a number of power laws. A power law describes the relationship between &quot;N&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) (the number of objects of diameter greater than &quot;D&quot;) and &quot;D&quot;, and is referred to as brightness slope. The number of objects is inversely proportional to some power of the diameter &quot;D&quot;:
:formula_1 which yields (assuming &quot;q&quot; is not 1):formula_2
(The constant may be non-zero only if the power law doesn&#x27;t apply at high values of &quot;D&quot;.)

Early estimates that were based on measurements of the apparent magnitude distribution found a value of q = 4 ± 0.5, which implied that there are 8 (=23) times more objects in the 100–200 km range than in the 200–400 km range. 
Recent research has revealed that the size distributions of the hot classical and cold classical objects have differing slopes. The slope for the hot objects is q = 5.3 at large diameters and q = 2.0 at small diameters with the change in slope at 110 km. The slope for the cold objects is q = 8.2 at large diameters and q = 2.9 at small diameters with a change in slope at 140 km. The size distributions of the scattering objects, the plutinos, and the Neptune trojans have slopes similar to the other dynamically hot populations, but may instead have a divot, a sharp decrease in the number of objects below a specific size. This divot is hypothesized to be due to either the collisional evolution of the population, or to be due to the population having formed with no objects below this size, with the smaller objects being fragments of the original objects.

The smallest known Kuiper belt objects with radii below 1 km have only been detected by stellar occultations, as they are far too dim (magnitude 35) to be seen directly by telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope. The first reports of these occultations were from Schlichting et al. in December 2009, who announced the discovery of a small, sub-kilometre-radius Kuiper belt object in archival &quot;Hubble&quot; photometry from March 2007. With an estimated radius of or a diameter of , the object was detected by &quot;Hubble&quot; star tracking system when it briefly occulted a star for 0.3 seconds. In a subsequent study published in December 2012, Schlichting et al. performed a more thorough analysis of archival &quot;Hubble&quot; photometry and reported another occultation event by a sub-kilometre-sized Kuiper belt object, estimated to be in radius or in diameter. From the occultation events detected in 2009 and 2012, Schlichting et al. determined the Kuiper belt object size distribution slope to be q = 3.6 ± 0.2 or q = 3.8 ± 0.2, with the assumptions of a single power law and a uniform ecliptic latitude distribution. Their result implies a strong deficit of sub-kilometer-sized Kuiper belt objects compared to extrapolations from the population of larger Kuiper belt objects with diameters above 90 km.

Observations made by NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter showed &quot;higher than model-predicted dust fluxes&quot; as far as 55 au, not explained by any existing model.

== Scattered objects ==

The scattered disc is a sparsely populated region, overlapping with the Kuiper belt but extending to beyond 100 AU. Scattered disc objects (SDOs) have very elliptical orbits, often also very inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of Solar System formation show both KBOs and SDOs first forming in a primordial belt, with later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, sending the objects outward, some into stable orbits (the KBOs) and some into unstable orbits, the scattered disc. Due to its unstable nature, the scattered disc is suspected to be the point of origin of many of the Solar System&#x27;s short-period comets. Their dynamic orbits occasionally force them into the inner Solar System, first becoming centaurs, and then short-period comets.

According to the Minor Planet Center, which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, a KBO is any object that orbits exclusively within the defined Kuiper belt region regardless of origin or composition. Objects found outside the belt are classed as scattered objects. In some scientific circles the term &quot;Kuiper belt object&quot; has become synonymous with any icy minor planet native to the outer Solar System assumed to have been part of that initial class, even if its orbit during the bulk of Solar System history has been beyond the Kuiper belt (e.g. in the scattered-disc region). They often describe scattered disc objects as &quot;scattered Kuiper belt objects&quot;. Eris, which is known to be more massive than Pluto, is often referred to as a KBO, but is technically an SDO. A consensus among astronomers as to the precise definition of the Kuiper belt has yet to be reached, and this issue remains unresolved.

The centaurs, which are not normally considered part of the Kuiper belt, are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward. The Minor Planet Center groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.

=== Triton ===

During its period of migration, Neptune is thought to have captured a large KBO, Triton, which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (that is, it orbits opposite to Neptune&#x27;s rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object&#x27;s gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton&#x27;s capture. Triton is only 14% larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.

== Largest KBOs ==

Since 2000, a number of KBOs with diameters of between 500 and , more than half that of Pluto (diameter 2370 km), have been discovered. Quaoar, a classical KBO discovered in 2002, is over 1,200 km across. and , both announced on 29 July 2005, are larger still. Other objects, such as 28978 Ixion (discovered in 2001) and 20000 Varuna (discovered in 2000), measure roughly across.

=== Pluto ===
The discovery of these large KBOs in orbits similar to Pluto&#x27;s led many to conclude that, aside from its relative size, Pluto was not particularly different from other members of the Kuiper belt. Not only are these objects similar to Pluto in size, but many also have natural satellites, and are of similar composition (methane and carbon monoxide have been found both on Pluto and on the largest KBOs). Thus, just as Ceres was considered a planet before the discovery of its fellow asteroids, some began to suggest that Pluto might also be reclassified.

The issue was brought to a head by the discovery of Eris, an object in the scattered disc far beyond the Kuiper belt, that is now known to be 27% more massive than Pluto. (Eris was originally thought to be larger than Pluto by volume, but the &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission found this not to be the case.) In response, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) was forced to define what a planet is for the first time, and in so doing included in their definition that a planet must have &quot;cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit&quot;. As Pluto shares its orbit with many other sizable objects, it was deemed not to have cleared its orbit and was thus reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet, making it a member of the Kuiper belt.

It is not clear how many KBOs are large enough to be dwarf planets. Consideration of the surprisingly low densities of many dwarf-planet candidates suggests that not many are. , Pluto, Haumea, , and Makemake are accepted by most astronomers; some have proposed other bodies, such as , , , and .

=== Satellites ===
The six largest TNOs (Eris, Pluto, Gonggong, Makemake, Haumea and Quaoar) are all known to have satellites, and two of them have more than one. A higher percentage of the larger KBOs have satellites than the smaller objects in the Kuiper belt, suggesting that a different formation mechanism was responsible. There are also a high number of binaries (two objects close enough in mass to be orbiting &quot;each other&quot;) in the Kuiper belt. The most notable example is the Pluto–Charon binary, but it is estimated that around 11% of KBOs exist in binaries.

== Exploration ==
On 19 January 2006, the first spacecraft to explore the Kuiper belt, &quot;New Horizons&quot;, was launched, which flew by Pluto on 14 July 2015. Beyond the Pluto flyby, the mission&#x27;s goal was to locate and investigate other, farther objects in the Kuiper belt.


On 15 October 2014, it was revealed that &quot;Hubble&quot; had uncovered three potential targets, provisionally designated PT1 (&quot;potential target 1&quot;), PT2 and PT3 by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team. The objects&#x27; diameters were estimated to be in the 30–55 km range; too small to be seen by ground telescopes, at distances from the Sun of 43–44 AU, which would put the encounters in the 2018–2019 period. The initial estimated probabilities that these objects were reachable within &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ fuel budget were 100%, 7%, and 97%, respectively. All were members of the &quot;cold&quot; (low-inclination, low-eccentricity) classical Kuiper belt, and thus very different from Pluto. PT1 (given the temporary designation &quot;1110113Y&quot; on the HST web site), the most favorably situated object, was magnitude 26.8, 30–45 km in diameter, and was encountered in January 2019. Once sufficient orbital information was provided, the Minor Planet Center gave official designations to the three target KBOs: (PT1), (PT2), and (PT3). By the fall of 2014, a possible fourth target, , had been eliminated by follow-up observations. PT2 was out of the running before the Pluto flyby.

On 26 August 2015, the first target, (nicknamed &quot;Ultima Thule&quot; and later named 486958 Arrokoth), was chosen. Course adjustment took place in late October and early November 2015, leading to a flyby in January 2019. On 1 July 2016, NASA approved additional funding for &quot;New Horizons&quot; to visit the object.

On 2 December 2015, &quot;New Horizons&quot; detected what was then called (later named &quot;15810 Arawn&quot;) from away.

On 1 January 2019, &quot;New Horizons&quot; successfully flew by Arrokoth, returning data showing Arrokoth to be a contact binary 32 km long by 16 km wide. The Ralph instrument aboard &quot;New Horizons&quot; confirmed Arrokoth&#x27;s red color. Data from the fly-by will continue to be downloaded over the next 20 months.

No follow-up missions for &quot;New Horizons&quot; are planned, though at least two concepts for missions that would return to orbit or land on Pluto have been studied. Beyond Pluto, there exist many large KBOs that cannot be visited with &quot;New Horizons&quot;, such as the dwarf planets Makemake and Haumea. New missions would be tasked to explore and study these objects in detail. Thales Alenia Space has studied the logistics of an orbiter mission to Haumea, a high priority scientific target due to its status as the parent body of a collisional family that includes several other TNOs, as well as Haumea&#x27;s ring and two moons. The lead author, Joel Poncy, has advocated for new technology that would allow spacecraft to reach and orbit KBOs in 10–20 years or less. &quot;New Horizons&quot; Principal Investigator Alan Stern has informally suggested missions that would flyby the planets Uranus or Neptune before visiting new KBO targets, thus furthering the exploration of the Kuiper belt while also visiting these ice giant planets for the first time since the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flybys in the 1980s.

===Design studies and concept missions===
Quaoar has been considered as a flyby target for a probe tasked with exploring the interstellar medium, as it currently lies near the heliospheric nose; Pontus Brandt at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and his colleagues have studied a probe that would flyby Quaoar in the 2030s before continuing to the interstellar medium through the heliospheric nose. Among their interests in Quaoar include its likely disappearing methane atmosphere and cryovolcanism. The mission studied by Brandt and his colleagues would launch using SLS and achieve 30 km/s using a Jupiter flyby. Alternatively, for an orbiter mission, a study published in 2012 concluded that Ixion and Huya are among the most feasible targets. For instance, the authors calculated that an orbiter mission could reach Ixion after 17 years cruise time if launched in 2039.

== Extrasolar Kuiper belts ==

By 2006, astronomers had resolved dust discs thought to be Kuiper belt-like structures around nine stars other than the Sun. They appear to fall into two categories: wide belts, with radii of over 50 AU, and narrow belts (tentatively like that of the Solar System) with radii of between 20 and 30 AU and relatively sharp boundaries. Beyond this, 15–20% of solar-type stars have an observed infrared excess that is suggestive of massive Kuiper-belt-like structures. Most known debris discs around other stars are fairly young, but the two images on the right, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in January 2006, are old enough (roughly 300 million years) to have settled into stable configurations. The left image is a &quot;top view&quot; of a wide belt, and the right image is an &quot;edge view&quot; of a narrow belt. Computer simulations of dust in the Kuiper belt suggest that when it was younger, it may have resembled the narrow rings seen around younger stars.

<text>Kraftwerk (, ) are a German electronic band formed in Düsseldorf in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. Widely considered innovators and pioneers of electronic music, Kraftwerk were among the first successful acts to popularize the genre. The group began as part of West Germany&#x27;s experimental krautrock scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, drum machines, and vocoders. Wolfgang Flür joined the band in 1973 and Karl Bartos in 1975, expanding the band to a quartet.

On commercially successful albums such as &quot;Autobahn&quot; (1974), &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; (1977), &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; (1978), and &quot;Computer World&quot; (1981), Kraftwerk developed a self-described &quot;robot pop&quot; style that combined electronic music with pop melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylized image including matching suits. Following the release of &quot;Electric Café&quot; (1986), Flür left the group in 1987, followed by Bartos in 1990. The band released &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot;, their latest album of new material, in 2003. Founding member Schneider left in 2008. The band, with new members, has continued to tour under the leadership of Hütter.

The band&#x27;s work has influenced a diverse range of artists and many genres of modern music, including synth-pop, hip hop, post-punk, techno, house music, ambient, and club music. In 2014, the Recording Academy honoured Kraftwerk with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They later won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album with their live album &quot;3-D The Catalogue&quot; (2017) at the 2018 ceremony. In 2021, Kraftwerk was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in the early influence category. As of 2024, the band continues to tour, with the members&#x27; live performances celebrating Kraftwerk&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1970–1973) ===
Florian Schneider (flutes, synthesizers, violin) and Ralf Hütter (organ, synthesizers) met as students at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in Düsseldorf in the late 1960s, participating in the German experimental music and art scene of the time, which &quot;Melody Maker&quot; jokingly dubbed &quot;krautrock&quot;.

They joined a quintet known as Organisation, which released one album, &quot;Tone Float&quot; in 1970, issued on RCA Records in the UK, and split shortly thereafter. Schneider became interested in synthesizers, deciding to acquire one in 1970. While visiting an exhibition in their hometown about visual artists Gilbert and George, they see &quot;two men wearing suits and ties, claiming to bring art into everyday life. The same year, Hütter and Schneider started bringing everyday life into art and form Kraftwerk&quot;.

Early Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970 to 1974 fluctuated, as Hütter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians during the preparations for and the recording of three albums and sporadic live appearances, including guitarist Michael Rother and drummer Klaus Dinger, who left to form Neu!. The only constant figure in these line-ups was Schneider, whose main instrument at the time was the flute; at times he also played the violin and guitar, all processed through a varied array of electronic devices. Hütter, who left the band for eight months to focus on completing his university studies, played synthesizer and keyboards (including Farfisa organ and electric piano).

The band released two free-form experimental rock albums, &quot;Kraftwerk&quot; (1970) and &quot;Kraftwerk 2&quot; (1972). The albums were mostly exploratory musical improvisations played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, organ, flute, and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Both albums are purely instrumental. Live performances from 1972 to 1973 were mostly made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. Occasionally, they performed with bass players as well. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. Later in 1973, Wolfgang Flür joined the group for rehearsals, and the unit performed as a trio on the television show &quot;Aspekte&quot; for German television network ZDF.

With &quot;Ralf und Florian&quot;, released in 1973, Kraftwerk began to rely more heavily on synthesizers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk&#x27;s first use of the vocoder in the song &quot;Ananas Symphonie&quot; (Pineapple Symphony,) which became one of its musical signatures. According to English music journalist Simon Reynolds, Kraftwerk were influenced by what he called the &quot;adrenalized insurgency&quot; of Detroit artists of the late &#x27;60s MC5 and the Stooges.

The input, expertise, and influence of producer and engineer Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank was highly significant in the early years of Kraftwerk. Plank also worked with many of the other leading German electronic acts of that time, including members of Can, Neu!, Cluster, and Harmonia. As a result of his work with Kraftwerk, Plank&#x27;s studio near Cologne became one of the most sought-after studios in the late 1970s. Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums.

=== International breakthrough: &quot;Autobahn&quot; and &quot;Radioactivity&quot; (1974–1976) ===

The release of &quot;Autobahn&quot; in 1974 saw Kraftwerk moving away from the sound of its first three albums. Hütter and Schneider had invested in newer technology such as the Minimoog and the EMS Synthi AKS, helping give Kraftwerk a newer, &quot;disciplined&quot; sound. &quot;Autobahn&quot; was also the last album that Conny Plank engineered. After the commercial success of &quot;Autobahn&quot; in the US, where it peaked at number 5 in the Billboard Top LPs &amp; Tapes, Hütter and Schneider invested in updating their studio, thus lessening their reliance on outside producers. At this time the painter and graphic artist Emil Schult became a regular collaborator, designing artwork, cowriting lyrics, and accompanying the group on tour.

The year 1975 saw a turning point in Kraftwerk&#x27;s live shows. With financial support from Phonogram Inc., in the US, they were able to undertake a tour to promote the &quot;Autobahn&quot; album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up in the form of a quartet. Hütter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the Minimoog and ARP Odyssey, with Schneider&#x27;s use of flute diminishing. The two men started singing live for the first time, and Schneider processing his voice with a vocoder live. Wolfgang Flür and new recruit Karl Bartos performed on home-made electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan vibraphone on stage. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.

After the 1975 &quot;Autobahn&quot; tour, Kraftwerk began work on a follow-up album, &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; (German title: &quot;Radio-Aktivität&quot;). After further investment in new equipment, the Kling Klang Studio became a fully working recording studio. The group used the central theme in radio communication, which had become enhanced on their last tour of the United States. With Emil Schult working on artwork and lyrics, Kraftwerk began to compose music for the new record. Even though &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; was less commercially successful than &quot;Autobahn&quot; in the UK and United States, the album served to open up the European market for Kraftwerk, earning them a gold disc in France. Kraftwerk made videos and performed several European live dates to promote the album. With the release of &quot;Autobahn&quot; and &quot;Radio-Activity&quot;, Kraftwerk left behind avant-garde experimentation and moved towards the electronic pop tunes for which they are best known.

In 1976, Kraftwerk toured in support of the &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; album. David Bowie was among the fans of the record and invited the band to support him on his &quot;Station to Station&quot; tour, an offer the group declined. Despite some innovations in touring, Kraftwerk took a break from live performances after the &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; tour of 1976.

=== &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;, &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; and &quot;Computer World&quot; (1977–1982) ===

After having finished the Radio-Activity tour Kraftwerk began recording &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; (German: &quot;Trans-Europa-Express&quot;) at the Kling Klang Studio. &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; was mixed at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. It was around this time that Hütter and Schneider met David Bowie at the Kling Klang Studio. A collaboration was mentioned in an interview (Brian Eno) with Hütter, but it never materialised. The release of &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; in March 1977 was marked with an extravagant train journey used as a press conference by EMI France. The album won a disco award in New York later that year.

In May 1978 Kraftwerk released &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; (German: &quot;Die Mensch-Maschine&quot;), recorded at the Kling Klang Studio. Due to the complexity of the recording, the album was mixed at Studio Rudas in Düsseldorf. The band hired sound engineer Leanard Jackson from Detroit to work with Joschko Rudas on the final mix. &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; was the first Kraftwerk album where Karl Bartos was cocredited as a songwriter. The cover, produced in black, white and red, was inspired by Russian artist El Lissitzky and the Suprematism movement. Gunther Frohling photographed the group for the cover, a now-iconic image which featured the quartet dressed in red shirts and black ties. After it was released Kraftwerk did not release another album or tour for three years.

In May 1981 Kraftwerk released &quot;Computer World&quot; (German: &quot;Computerwelt&quot;) on EMI Records. It was recorded at Kling Klang Studio between 1978 and 1981. Much of this time was spent modifying the studio to make it portable so the band could take it on tour. Some of the electronic vocals on &quot;Computer World&quot; were generated using a Texas Instruments language translator. &quot;Computer Love&quot; was released as a single backed with the &quot;Man-Machine&quot; track &quot;The Model&quot;. Radio DJs were more interested in the B-side so the single was repackaged by EMI and re-released with &quot;The Model&quot; as the A-side. The single reached number one in the UK, making &quot;The Model&quot; Kraftwerk&#x27;s most successful song in that country.As a result, the &quot;Man-Machine&quot; album also became a success in the UK, peaking at number 9 in the album chart in February 1982. The band&#x27;s live set focused increasingly on song-based material, with greater use of vocals and the use of sequencing equipment for both percussion and music. In contrast to their cool and controlled image, the group used sequencers interactively, which allowed for live improvisation. Ironically, Kraftwerk did not own a computer at the time of recording &quot;Computer World&quot;.

Kraftwerk returned to live performance with the &quot;Computer World&quot; tour of 1981, where the band effectively packed up its entire Kling Klang studio and took it along on the road. They also made greater use of live visuals including back-projected slides and films synchronized with the music as the technology developed, the use of hand-held miniaturized instruments during the set, and the use of replica mannequins of themselves to perform on stage during the song &quot;The Robots&quot;.

=== &quot;Electric Café&quot; (1982–1989) ===

In 1982 Kraftwerk began to work on a new album that initially had the working title &quot;Technicolor&quot; but due to trademark issues was changed to &quot;Electric Café&quot; for its original release in 1986 (for a remastered re-release in 2009, it was retitled again after its original working title, &quot;Techno Pop&quot;). One of the songs from these recording sessions was &quot;Tour de France&quot;, which EMI released as a single in 1983. This song was a reflection of the band&#x27;s new-found obsession for cycling. After the physically demanding &quot;Computer World&quot; tour, Ralf Hütter had been looking for forms of exercise that fitted in with the image of Kraftwerk; subsequently he encouraged the group to become vegetarians and take up cycling. &quot;Tour de France&quot; included sounds that followed this theme including bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist. At the time of the single&#x27;s release Ralf Hütter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based on cycling. The other members of the band were not convinced, and the theme was left to the single alone. &quot;Tour de France&quot; was released in German and French. The vocals of the song were recorded on the Kling Klang Studio stairs to create the right atmosphere. &quot;Tour de France&quot; was featured in the 1984 film &quot;Breakin&#x27;&quot;, showing the influence that Kraftwerk had on West Coast Hip Hop.
In May or June 1982, during the recording of &quot;Tour de France&quot;, Ralf Hütter was involved in a serious cycling accident. He suffered head injuries and remained in a coma for several days. During 1983 Wolfgang Flür was beginning to spend less time in the studio. Since the band began using sequencers his role as a drummer was becoming less frequent. He preferred to spend his time travelling with his girlfriend. Flür was also experiencing artistic difficulties with the band. Though he toured the world with Kraftwerk as a drummer in 1981, his playing does not appear on that year&#x27;s &quot;Computer World&quot; or on the 1986 album &quot;Electric Café&quot;. In 1987 he appeared last time with the band in &quot;The Telephone Call&quot; music video. As he declined to perform with the band in their Italian concerts in 1990 he was replaced on-stage by Fritz Hilpert.

=== &quot;The Mix&quot; (1990–1999) ===

After years of withdrawal from live performance Kraftwerk began to tour Europe more frequently. In February 1990 the band played a few secret shows in Italy. Karl Bartos left the band shortly afterwards. The next proper tour was in 1991, for the album &quot;The Mix&quot;. Hütter and Schneider wished to continue the synth-pop quartet style of presentation, and recruited Fernando Abrantes as a replacement for Bartos. Abrantes left the band shortly after though. In late 1991, long-time Kling Klang Studio sound engineer Henning Schmitz was brought in to finish the remainder of the tour and to complete a new version of the quartet that remained active until 2008.

In 1997 Kraftwerk made a famous appearance at the dance festival Tribal Gathering held in England. In 1998, the group toured the US and Japan for the first time since 1981, along with shows in Brazil and Argentina. Three new songs were performed during this period and a further two tested in soundchecks, which remain unreleased. Following this trek, the group decided to take another break.

In July 1999 the single &quot;Tour de France&quot; was reissued in Europe by EMI after it had been out of print for several years. It was released for the first time on CD in addition to a repressing of the 12-inch vinyl single. Both versions feature slightly altered artwork that removed the faces of Flür and Bartos from the four-man cycling paceline depicted on the original cover. In 1999 ex-member Flür published his autobiography in Germany, &quot;Ich war ein Roboter&quot;. Later English-language editions of the book were titled &quot;Kraftwerk: I Was a Robot&quot;.

In 1999, Kraftwerk were commissioned to create an a cappella jingle for the Hannover Expo 2000 world&#x27;s fair in Germany. The jingle was subsequently developed into the single &quot;Expo 2000&quot;, which was released in December 1999, and remixed and re-released as &quot;Expo Remix&quot; in November 2000.

=== &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot; and touring the world (2000–2009) ===
In August 2003 the band released &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot;, its first album of new material since 1986&#x27;s &quot;Electric Café&quot;. In January and February 2003, before the release of the album, the band started the extensive &quot;Minimum-Maximum&quot; world tour, using four customised Sony VAIO laptop computers, effectively leaving the entire Kling Klang studio at home in Germany. The group also obtained a new set of transparent video panels to replace its four large projection screens. This greatly streamlined the running of all of the group&#x27;s sequencing, sound-generating, and visual-display software. From this point, the band&#x27;s equipment increasingly reduced manual playing, replacing it with interactive control of sequencing equipment. Hütter retained the most manual performance, still playing musical lines by hand on a controller keyboard and singing live vocals and having a repeating ostinato. Schneider&#x27;s live vocoding had been replaced by software-controlled speech-synthesis techniques. In November, the group made a surprising appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in Edinburgh, Scotland, performing &quot;Aerodynamik&quot;. The same year a promotional box set entitled &quot;12345678&quot; (subtitled &quot;The Catalogue&quot;) was issued, with plans for a proper commercial release to follow. The box featured remastered editions of the group&#x27;s eight core studio albums, from &quot;Autobahn&quot; to &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot;. This long-awaited box-set was eventually released in a different set of remasters in November 2009.

In June 2005 the band&#x27;s first-ever official live album, &quot;Minimum-Maximum&quot;, which was compiled from the shows during the band&#x27;s tour of spring 2004, received praise from &quot;NME&quot;. The album contained reworked tracks from existing studio albums. This included a track titled &quot;Planet of Visions&quot; that was a reworking of &quot;Expo 2000&quot;. In support of this release, Kraftwerk made another quick sweep around the Balkans with dates in Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Turkey, and Greece. In December, the &quot;Minimum-Maximum&quot; DVD was released. During 2006, the band performed at festivals in Norway, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium, and Germany.

In April 2008 the group played three shows in US cities Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Denver, and were a coheadliner at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. This was their second appearance at the festival since 2004. Further shows were performed in Ireland, Poland, Ukraine, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore later that year. The touring quartet consisted of Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, and video technician Stefan Pfaffe, who became an official member in 2008. Original member Florian Schneider was absent from the lineup. Hütter stated that he was working on other projects. On 21 November, Kraftwerk officially confirmed Florian Schneider&#x27;s departure from the band; &quot;The Independent&quot; commented: &quot;There is something brilliantly Kraftwerkian about the news that Florian Schneider, a founder member of the German electronic pioneers, is leaving the band to pursue a solo career. Many successful bands break up after just a few years. It has apparently taken Schneider and his musical partner, Ralf Hütter, four decades to discover musical differences.&quot; Kraftwerk&#x27;s headline set at Global Gathering in Melbourne, Australia, on 22 November was cancelled moments before it was scheduled to begin, due to Fritz Hilpert experiencing a medical emergency.

In 2009, Kraftwerk performed concerts with special 3D background graphics in Wolfsburg, Germany; Manchester, UK; and Randers, Denmark. Members of the audience were able to watch this multimedia part of the show with 3D glasses, which were given out. During the Manchester concert (part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival) four members of the GB cycling squad (Jason Kenny, Ed Clancy, Jamie Staff and Geraint Thomas) rode around the Velodrome while the band performed &quot;Tour de France&quot;. The group also played several festival dates, the last being at the Bestival 2009 in September, on the Isle of Wight. 2009 also saw the release of &quot;The Catalogue&quot; box set in November. It is a 12-inch album-sized box set containing all eight remastered CDs in cardboard slipcases, as well as LP-sized booklets of photographs and artwork for each individual album.

=== &quot;The Catalogue&quot; and continued touring (2010–2017) ===
Although not officially confirmed, Ralf Hütter suggested that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums—&quot;Kraftwerk&quot;, &quot;Kraftwerk 2&quot; and &quot;Ralf and Florian&quot;—could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: &quot;We&#x27;ve just never really taken a look at those albums. They&#x27;ve always been available, but as really bad bootlegs. Now we have more artwork. Emil has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that we worked with, and drawings that Florian and I did. We took a lot of Polaroids in those days.&quot; Kraftwerk also released an iOS app called Kraftwerk Kling Klang Machine. The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.

Kraftwerk played at Ultra Music Festival in Miami on 23 March 2012. Initiated by Klaus Biesenbach, the Museum of Modern Art of New York organized an exhibit titled &quot;Kraftwerk – Retrospective 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8&quot; where the band performed their studio discography from &quot;Autobahn&quot; to &quot;Tour de France&quot; over the course of eight days to sell-out crowds. The exhibit later toured to the Tate Gallery as well as to K20 in Düsseldorf. Kraftwerk performed at the No Nukes 2012 Festival in Tokyo, Japan. Kraftwerk were also going to play at the Ultra Music Festival in Warsaw, but the event was cancelled; instead, Kraftwerk performed at Way Out West in Gothenburg. A limited edition version of the &quot;Catalogue&quot; box set was released during the retrospective, restricted to 2000 sets. Each box was individually numbered and inverted the colour scheme of the standard box. In December, Kraftwerk stated on their website that they would be playing their &quot;Catalogue&quot; in Düsseldorf and at London&#x27;s Tate Modern. Kraftwerk tickets were priced at £60 in London, but fans compared that to the $20 ticket price for tickets at New York&#x27;s MoMA in 2012, which caused consternation. Even so, the demand for the tickets at The Tate was so high that it shut down the website.

In March 2013, the band was not allowed to perform at a music festival in China due to unspecified &quot;political reasons&quot;. In an interview in June after performing the eight albums of &quot;The Catalogue&quot; in Sydney, Ralf Hütter stated: &quot;Now we have finished one to eight, now we can concentrate on number nine.&quot; In July, they performed at the 47th Montreux Jazz Festival. The band also played a 3-D concert on 12 July at Scotland&#x27;s biggest festival – T in the Park – in Balado, Kinross, as well as 20 July at Latitude Festival in Suffolk, and 21 July at the Longitude Festival in Dublin.

In October 2013 the band played four concerts, over two nights, in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The venue, Evoluon (the former technology museum of Philips Electronics, now a conference center) was handpicked by Ralf Hütter, for its retro-futuristic UFO-like architecture. Bespoke visuals of the building, with the saucer section descending from space, were displayed during the rendition of &quot;Spacelab.&quot;

In 2014, Kraftwerk brought their four-night, 3D &quot;Catalogue&quot; tour to the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and at NYC&#x27;s United Palace Theatre. They also played at the Cirkus in Stockholm, Sweden and at the music festival Summer Sonic in Tokyo, Japan. In November 2014 the 3D &quot;Catalogue&quot; live set was played in Paris, France, at the brand new Fondation Louis-Vuitton from 6 to 14 November. and then in the iconic Paradiso concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where they played before in 1976. In 2015, Ralf Hütter, being told that the Tour de France would be starting that year in the nearby Dutch city of Utrecht, decided that Kraftwerk would perform during the &quot;Grand Départ&quot;. Eventually the band played three concerts 3 and 4 July in TivoliVredenburg performing &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot; and visited the start of the Tour in-between.

At the request of race director Christian Prudhomme, Kraftwerk performed at the Tour de France on 1 July 2017, this time in Kraftwerk&#x27;s hometown Düsseldorf. French electronic band Air opened the concert, invited by Kraftwerk. Concertgoers were offered 3D glasses to perceive stereoscopic effects on the video screen.

=== &quot;3-D The Catalogue&quot; and Schneider&#x27;s death (2017–present) ===
In April 2017, Kraftwerk announced &quot;3-D The Catalogue&quot;, a live album and video documenting performances of all eight albums in &quot;The Catalogue&quot; that was released 26 May 2017. It is available in multiple formats, the most extensive of which being a 4-disc Blu-ray set with a 236-page hardback book. The album was nominated for the Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronic Album and Best Surround Sound Album at the ceremony that took place on 28 January 2018, winning the former, which became the band&#x27;s first Grammy win.

On 20 July 2018, at a concert in Stuttgart, German astronaut Alexander Gerst performed &quot;Spacelab&quot; with the band while aboard the International Space Station, joining via a live video link. Gerst played melodies using a tablet as his instrument alongside Hütter as a duet, and delivered a short message to the audience.

On 20 July 2019, Kraftwerk headlined the Saturday night lineup on the Lovell Stage at Bluedot Festival, a music and science festival held annually at Jodrell Bank Observatory, Cheshire, UK. The 2019 festival celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.

On 21 April 2020, Florian Schneider died at age 73 after a brief battle with cancer. On 3 July 2020, the German-language versions of &quot;Trans Europe Express&quot;, &quot;The Man Machine&quot;, &quot;Computer World&quot;, &quot;Techno Pop&quot; and &quot;The Mix&quot;, alongside &quot;3-D The Catalogue&quot;, were released worldwide on streaming services for the first time.

On 21 December 2020, Parlophone/WEA released &quot;Remixes&quot;, a digital compilation album. It includes remixed tracks taken from singles released 1991, 1999, 2000, 2004 and 2007, plus the previously unreleased &quot;Non Stop&quot;, a version of &quot;Musique Non-Stop&quot; used as a jingle by MTV Europe beginning in 1993. The cover re-uses the cover from &quot;Expo Remix&quot;. The compilation was released on CD and vinyl in 2022.

On 30 October 2021, Kraftwerk were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. In November 2021, the band announced plans for a 2022 North American tour. With the members&#x27; live performances celebrating Kraftwerk&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, the &quot;Remixes&quot; compilation album came out on compact disc and vinyl for the first time in addition.

From 27 May to 10 July 2022, the formation undertook a successful North American tour, performing in 24 cities.

Since 2023, they have begun visualising their music on the façades of castles and other historic buildings in a special way.

In May 2024, they performed nine nights at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, presenting one of their eight albums each night and another concert as the ninth gig.

On 27 July 2024, at the Fuji Rock Festival in Naeba, Kraftwerk played a cover version of another artist&#x27;s work for the first time: &quot;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&quot; by Ryuichi Sakamoto, who died in 2023. Hütter had been friends with Sakamoto since 1981. After performing &quot;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&quot;, Kraftwerk played &quot;Radioactivity&quot;, for which Sakamoto wrote the Japanese lyrics in 2012.

On 4 December 2024, Kraftwerk announced their Multimedia Tour to coincide with the 50th Anniversary of their first album, enlisting professional skateboarder Tony Hawk in doing so.

== Music and artistry ==
=== Style ===
Kraftwerk have been recognized as pioneers of electronic music as well as subgenres such as electropop, art pop, house music, synth-pop and electronic rock. In its early incarnation, the band pursued an avant-garde, experimental rock style inspired by the compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen. Hütter has also listed the Beach Boys as a major influence. The group was also inspired by the funk music of James Brown and, later, punk rock. They were initially connected to the German krautrock scene. In the mid-1970s, they transitioned to an electronic sound which they described as &quot;robot pop&quot;. Kraftwerk&#x27;s lyrics dealt with post-war European urban life and technology—traveling by car on the &quot;Autobahn&quot;, traveling by train, using home computers, and the like. They were influenced by the modernist Bauhaus aesthetic, seeing art as inseparable from everyday function. Usually, the lyrics are very minimal but reveal both an innocent celebration of, and a knowing caution about, the modern world, as well as playing an integral role in the rhythmic structure of the songs. Many of Kraftwerk&#x27;s songs express the paradoxical nature of modern urban life: a strong sense of alienation existing side by side with a celebration of the joys of modern technology.

Starting with the release of &quot;Autobahn&quot;, Kraftwerk began to release a series of concept albums (&quot;Radio-Activity&quot;, &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;, &quot;The Man-Machine&quot;, &quot;Computer World&quot;, &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot;). All of Kraftwerk&#x27;s albums from &quot;Trans Europe Express&quot; onwards, except &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot;, have been released in separate versions: one with German vocals for sale in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and one with English vocals for the rest of the world, with occasional variations in other languages when conceptually appropriate. Live performance has always played an important part in Kraftwerk&#x27;s activities. Also, despite its live shows generally being based around formal songs and compositions, live improvisation often plays a noticeable role in its performances. This trait can be traced back to the group&#x27;s roots in the first experimental Krautrock scene of the late 1960s, but, significantly, it has continued to be a part of its playing even as it makes ever greater use of digital and computer-controlled sequencing in its performances. Some of the band&#x27;s familiar compositions have been observed to have developed from live improvisations at its concerts or sound-checks.

=== Technological innovations ===
Throughout their career, Kraftwerk have pushed the limits of music technology with some notable innovations, such as home-made instruments and custom-built devices. The group has always perceived their Kling Klang Studio as a complex music instrument, as well as a sound laboratory; Florian Schneider in particular developed a fascination with music technology, with the result that the technical aspects of sound generation and recording gradually became his main fields of activity within the band. Alexei Monroe called Kraftwerk the &quot;first successful artists to incorporate representations of industrial sounds into non-academic electronic music&quot;.
Kraftwerk used a custom-built vocoder on their albums &quot;Ralf und Florian&quot; and &quot;Autobahn&quot;; the device was constructed by engineers P. Leunig and K. Obermayer of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Braunschweig. Hütter and Schneider received a patent for an electronic drum kit with sensor pads, filed in July 1975 and issued in June 1977. It must be hit with metal sticks, which are connected to the device to complete a circuit that triggers analog synthetic percussion sounds. The band first performed in public with this device in 1973, on the television program &quot;Aspekte&quot; (on the all-German channel Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen), where it was played by Wolfgang Flür. They created drum machines for &quot;Autobahn&quot; and &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;.

On the &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; tour in 1976 Kraftwerk tested out an experimental light-beam-activated drum cage allowing Flür to trigger electronic percussion through arm and hand movements. Unfortunately, the device did not work as planned, and it was quickly abandoned. The same year Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider commissioned Bonn-based &quot;Synthesizerstudio Bonn, Matten &amp; Wiechers&quot; to design and build the Synthanorma Sequenzer with Intervallomat, a 4×8 / 2×16 / 1×32 step-sequencer system with some features that commercial products couldn&#x27;t provide at that time. The music sequencer was used by the band for the first time to control the electronic sources creating the rhythmic sound of the album &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;.

Since 2002, Kraftwerk&#x27;s live performances have been conducted with the use of virtual technology (i.e. software replicating and replacing original analogue or digital equipment). According to Fritz Hilpert, &quot;the mobility of music technology and the reliability of the notebooks and software have greatly simplified the realization of complex touring setups: we generate all sounds on the laptops in real time and manipulate them with controller maps. It takes almost no time to get our compact stage system set up for performance. [...] This way, we can bring our Kling-Klang Studio with us on stage. The physical light weight of our equipment also translates into an enormous ease of use when working with software synthesizers and sound processors. Every tool imaginable is within immediate reach or just a few mouse clicks away on the Internet.&quot;

=== Reclusiveness and eccentricity ===
The band is also known for being notoriously reclusive, providing rare and enigmatic interviews, using life-size mannequins and robots while conducting official photo shoots, refusing to answer fanmail and barring visitors from the Kling Klang Studio, the precise location of which they used to keep secret.

Another notable example of this eccentric behavior was reported to Johnny Marr of the Smiths by Karl Bartos, who explained that anyone trying to contact the band for collaboration would be told the studio telephone did not have a ringer since, while recording, the band did not like to hear any kind of noise pollution. Instead, callers were instructed to phone the studio precisely at a certain time, whereupon the phone would be answered by Ralf Hütter, despite never hearing the phone ring.

Chris Martin of Coldplay recalled in a 2007 article in &quot;Q&quot; magazine the process of requesting permission to use the melody from the track &quot;Computer Love&quot; on &quot;Talk&quot; from the album &quot;X&amp;Y&quot;. He sent a letter through the lawyers of the respective parties and several weeks later received an envelope containing a handwritten reply that simply said &quot;yes&quot;.

== Influence and legacy ==
According to music journalist Neil McCormick, Kraftwerk might be &quot;the most influential group in pop history&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; wrote: The Beatles and Kraftwerk&#x27; may not have the ring of &#x27;the Beatles and the Stones&#x27;, but nonetheless, these are the two most important bands in music history&quot;. AllMusic wrote that their music &quot;resonates in virtually every new development to impact the contemporary pop scene of the late 20th century&quot;.

Kraftwerk&#x27;s musical style and image can be heard and seen in 1980s synth-pop groups such as Gary Numan, Ultravox, John Foxx, Visage, Simple Minds, The Human League, Soft Cell, and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Depeche Mode&#x27;s composer Martin Gore said: &quot;For anyone of our generation involved in electronic music, Kraftwerk were the godfathers&quot;. Daniel Miller, founder of Mute Records, purchased the vocoder used by Kraftwerk in their early albums, comparing it to owning &quot;the guitar Jimi Hendrix used on &#x27;Purple Haze. Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys, founding members of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), have stated that Kraftwerk was a major reference on their early work; OMD covered &quot;Neon Lights&quot; on the 1991 album, &quot;Sugar Tax&quot;. 

Kraftwerk influenced other forms of music such as hip hop, house, and drum and bass, and they are also regarded as one of the pioneers of the electro genre. Karl Hyde of Underworld has referenced Kraftwerk as a prominent influence. Most notably, &quot;Trans Europe Express&quot; and &quot;Numbers&quot; were interpolated into &quot;Planet Rock&quot; by Afrika Bambaataa &amp; the Soul Sonic Force, one of the earliest hip-hop/electro hits. Kraftwerk helped ignite the New York electro-movement. Techno was created by three musicians from Detroit, often referred to as the &#x27;Belleville three&#x27; (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson &amp; Derrick May), who fused the repetitive melodies of Kraftwerk with funk rhythms. The Belleville three were heavily influenced by Kraftwerk and their sounds because Kraftwerk&#x27;s sounds appealed to the middle-class black people residing in Detroit at this time.

The electronic band Ladytron were inspired by Kraftwerk&#x27;s song &quot;The Model&quot; when they composed their debut single &quot;He Took Her to a Movie&quot;. Aphex Twin noted Kraftwerk as one of his biggest influences and cited &quot;Computer World&quot; as a very influential album towards his music and sound. Björk has cited the band as one of her main musical influences. Electronic musician Kompressor has cited Kraftwerk as an influence. The band was also mentioned in the song &quot;Rappers We Crush&quot; by Kompressor and MC Frontalot (&quot;I hurry away, get in my Chrysler. Oh, the dismay!/Someone&#x27;s replaced all of my Backstreet Boys with Kraftwerk tapes!&quot;). Dr. Alex Paterson of the Orb listed &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; as one of his 13 favourite albums of all time. According to &quot;NME&quot;, Kraftwerk&#x27;s pioneering &quot;robot pop&quot; also spawned groups like The Prodigy and Daft Punk.

Kraftwerk inspired many acts from other styles and genres, along with having their work been repeatedly sampled. David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;V-2 Schneider&quot;, from the 1977&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; album, was a tribute to Florian Schneider. Post-punk bands Joy Division and New Order were heavily influenced by the band. Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis was a fan, and showed his colleagues records that would influence their music. New Order also sampled &quot;Uranium&quot; in its biggest hit &quot;Blue Monday&quot;. Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a cover of &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; on their 1987 album &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, which was lauded by Ralf Hütter: &quot;In general, we consider cover versions as an appreciation of our work. The version of &#x27;Hall of Mirrors&#x27; by Siouxsie and the Banshees is extraordinary, just like the arrangements of Alexander Bălănescu for his Balanescu Quartet release [of &quot;Possessed&quot;, 1992]. We also like the album &quot;El Baile Alemán&quot; of Señor Coconut a lot.&quot; Members of Blondie have admitted on several occasions that Kraftwerk were an important reference for their sound by the time they were working on their third album &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;. The worldwide hit &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; turned radically from an initial reggae-flavoured style to its distinctive electronic sound in order to imitate the technological approach of Kraftwerk&#x27;s albums and adapt it to a disco concept. Simple Minds and U2 each recorded cover versions of &quot;Neon Lights&quot;; Simple Minds&#x27; version was included on their 2001 all-covers album &quot;Neon Lights&quot;, and U2 included &quot;Neon Lights&quot; as the B-side of their 2004 single &quot;Vertigo&quot;. LCD Soundsystem&#x27;s &quot;Get Innocuous!&quot; is built on a sample of &quot;The Robots&quot;. Rammstein covered Kraftwerk&#x27;s song &quot;Das Modell&quot;, releasing it as a non-album single in 1997. John Frusciante cited the group&#x27;s ability to experiment of as an inspiration when working in a recording studio.

In 1989, a sped up version of Kraftwerk&#x27;s song &quot;Electric Café&quot; began appearing as the theme song for a series of sketches on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; called &quot;Sprockets&quot;, a German television spoof by Mike Myers. The 1998 comedy &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; features a fictional band called Autobahn, a parody of Kraftwerk and their 1974 record &quot;Autobahn&quot;.

In January 2018, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the 30-minute documentary &quot;Kraftwerk: Computer Love&quot;, which examined &quot;how Kraftwerk&#x27;s classic album &quot;Computer World&quot; has changed people&#x27;s lives.&quot;

In October 2019, Kraftwerk were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for 2020. On 12 May 2021, Kraftwerk were announced as an official inductee into the Hall, for the class of 2021.

<doc id="16800" wikidata="Q62623" url="?curid=16800" title="Kalmar Union">
<text>The Kalmar Union was a personal union in Scandinavia, agreed at Kalmar in Sweden as designed by Queen Margaret of Denmark. From 1397 to 1523, it joined under a single monarch the three kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden (then including much of present-day Finland), and Norway, together with Norway&#x27;s overseas colonies (then including Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland).

The union was not quite continuous; there were several short interruptions. Legally, the countries remained separate sovereign states, but their domestic and foreign policies were directed by a common monarch. Gustav Vasa&#x27;s election as King of Sweden on 6 June 1523, and his triumphant entry into Stockholm 11 days later, marked Sweden&#x27;s final secession from the Kalmar Union. The Danish king formally renounced his claim to Sweden in 1524 at the Treaty of Malmö.

== History ==

=== Inception ===
The union was the work of Scandinavian aristocracy who sought to counter the influence of the Hanseatic League, a northern German trade league centered around the Baltic and North Seas. Denmark in particular was in a power struggle with the League and had recently suffered a humiliating defeat in the Danish-Hanseatic War (1361-1370) that allowed the League to become even more powerful. On the personal level, the union was achieved by Queen Margaret I of Denmark (1353–1412). She was a daughter of King Valdemar IV of Denmark and had married King Haakon VI of Norway and Sweden, who was the son of King Magnus IV of Sweden, Norway and Scania. Margaret succeeded in having her and Haakon&#x27;s son Olaf recognized as heir to the throne of Denmark. In 1376, Olaf inherited the crown of Denmark from his maternal grandfather as King Olaf II, with his mother as guardian; when Haakon VI died in 1380, Olaf also inherited the crown of Norway.

Margaret became regent of Denmark and Norway when Olaf died in 1387, leaving her without an heir. She adopted her great-nephew Eric of Pomerania the same year. In 1388, Swedish nobles called upon her help against King Albert. After Margaret defeated Albert in 1389, her heir Eric was proclaimed King of Norway. Eric was subsequently elected King of Denmark and Sweden in 1396 under the banner of the House of Griffin. His coronation was held in Kalmar on 17 June 1397.

One main impetus for the union&#x27;s formation was to block German expansion northward into the Baltic region. The main reason for its failure to survive was the perpetual struggle between the monarch, who wanted a strong unified state, and the Swedish and Danish nobility, which did not.

The Union lost territory when Orkney and Shetland were pledged by Christian I, in his capacity as King of Norway, as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland in 1468. The money was never paid, so in 1472 the Kingdom of Scotland annexed the islands.

=== Internal conflict ===
Diverging interests (especially the Swedish nobility&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the dominant role played by Denmark and Holstein) gave rise to a conflict that hampered the union in several intervals starting in the 1430s. The Engelbrekt rebellion, which started in 1434, led to the overthrow of King Erik (in Denmark and Sweden in 1439, as well as Norway in 1442). The aristocracy sided with the rebels.

King Erik&#x27;s foreign policy, in particular his conflict with the Hanseatic League, necessitated greater taxation and complicated exports of iron, which in turn may have precipitated the rebellion. Discontent with the nature of Erik&#x27;s regime has also been cited as a motivating factor for the rebellion. Erik also lacked a standing army and had limited tax revenues.

The death of Christopher of Bavaria (who had no heirs) in 1448 ended a period in which the three Scandinavian kingdoms were uninterruptedly united for a lengthy period. Karl Knutsson Bonde ruled as king of Sweden (1448–1457, 1464–1465, and 1467–1470) and Norway (1449-1450). Christian of Oldenburg was king of Denmark (1448–1481), Norway (1450–1481) and Sweden (1457–1464). Karl and Christian fought over control of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, leading Christian to seize Sweden from him from 1457 to 1464 before a rebellion led Karl to become king of Sweden again. When Karl died in 1470, Christian tried to become king of Sweden again, but was defeated by Sten Sture the Elder in the 1471 battle of Brunkeberg outside Stockholm.

After Karl&#x27;s death, Sweden was mostly ruled by a series of &quot;protectors of the realm&quot; (&quot;riksföreståndare&quot;), with the Danish kings attempting to assert control. First of these protectors was Sten Sture, who kept Sweden under his control until 1497, when the Swedish nobility deposed him. A peasant rebellion led Sture to become regent of Sweden again in 1501. After his death, Sweden was ruled by Svante Nilsson (1504–1512) and then Svante&#x27;s son Sten Sture the Younger (1512–1520). Sten Sture the Younger was killed in the 1520 Battle of Bogesund when the Danish king Christian II invaded Sweden with a large army. Subsequently, Christian II was crowned King of Sweden, and supporters of Sten Sture were executed en masse in the Stockholm Bloodbath.

==== Swedish War of Liberation ====
After the Stockholm Bloodbath, Gustav Vasa (whose father, Erik Johansson, was executed) travelled to Dalarna, where he organized a rebellion against Christian II. Vasa made an alliance with Lübeck and successfully conquered most of Sweden. He was elected King of Sweden in 1523, effectively ending the Kalmar Union. After the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, the Treaty of Stettin (1570) saw Frederick II renounce all claims to Sweden.

===End and aftermath===
One of the union&#x27;s last structures remained until 1536/1537, when the Danish Privy Council, in the aftermath of the Count&#x27;s Feud, unilaterally declared Norway a Danish province. This did not happen. Instead, Norway became a hereditary kingdom in a real union with Denmark. Norway remained part of the realm of Denmark–Norway under the Oldenburg dynasty for nearly three centuries, until it was transferred to Sweden in 1814. The ensuing union between Sweden and Norway lasted until 1905, when prince Carl of Denmark, a grandson of both the incumbent king of Denmark and the late king of Sweden, was elected king of Norway.

According to historian Sverre Bagge, the Kalmar Union was unstable for several reasons:

* The power of national aristocracies.
* The varied effects of the Kalmar Union&#x27;s foreign policy on the three kingdoms. For example, attempted expansions into Northern Germany may have served Danish interests, but was costly to Swedes who had to pay higher taxes and were unable to export iron to the Hanseatic League.
* Geography complicated control of the union in the event of rebellion.
* The large territorial size of the union complicated control.
* Denmark was not strong enough to force Norway and Sweden to stay within the union.

<text>Krav Maga ( ; , ; ) is an Israeli self-defence system. Developed for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), it uses techniques derived from aikido, boxing, judo, karate and wrestling. It is known for its focus on real-world situations.

Krav Maga was originally developed by Hungarian-born Israeli martial artist Imi Lichtenfeld. Having grown up in Bratislava during a time of anti-Semitic unrest, Lichtenfeld used his training as a boxer and wrestler to defend Jewish neighborhoods against attackers in the mid-to-late 1930s, becoming an experienced street fighter. After his immigration to Mandatory Palestine in the late 1940s, he began to provide lessons on combat training to Jewish paramilitary groups that would later form the IDF during the 1948 Palestine war. As an instructor, he compiled his knowledge and experience into the combat system that would later become known as Krav Maga. This system would continue to be taught long after he left the IDF.

From the outset, the original concept of Krav Maga was to take the most effective and practical techniques of other fighting styles (originally European boxing, wrestling, and street fighting) and make them rapidly teachable to conscripted soldiers. It has a philosophy emphasizing aggression and simultaneous defensive and offensive manoeuvres. It has been used by Israeli special forces and regular infantry units alike. Closely related variations have been developed and adopted by Israeli law enforcement and intelligence organizations, and there are several organizations teaching variations of Krav Maga internationally. There are two forms of Krav Maga, with one type adapted for Israeli security forces and the other type adapted for civilian use.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;krav maga&quot; in Hebrew is literally translated as &#x27;contact combat&#x27; – the three letter root of the first word is &quot;q-r-b&quot; (), and the noun derived from this root means either &quot;combat&quot; or &quot;battle&quot;, while the second word is a participle form derived from the verb root &quot;n-g-‘&quot; (), that literally means either &quot;contact&quot; or &quot;touch&quot;.

==Basic principles==

Like most martial arts, Krav Maga encourages students to avoid physical confrontation. If this is impossible or unsafe, it promotes finishing a fight as quickly and aggressively as possible. Attacks are aimed at the most vulnerable parts of the body, and training is not limited to techniques that avoid severe injury; some even permanently injure or cause death to the opponent.

Students learn to defend against all variety of attacks and are taught to counter in the quickest and most efficient way.

Ideas in Krav Maga include:

* Simultaneous defense and attack.
* Developing physical aggression (not to be confused with emotional aggression or anger), with the view that physical aggression is the most important component in a fight.
* Continuing to strike the opponent until they are completely incapacitated.
* Attacking pre-emptively or counterattacking as soon as possible.
* Using any objects at hand that could be used to hit an opponent.
* Targeting attacks to the body&#x27;s most vulnerable points, such as: the eyes, neck or throat, face, solar plexus, groin, ribs, knee, foot, fingers, liver, etc.
* Using simple and easily repeatable strikes.
* Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat in order to look for escape routes, further attackers, or objects that could be used to strike an opponent.
* Developing muscle memory for quicker fighting reaction.
* Recognizing the importance of and expanding on instinctive response under stress.

Training can also cover the study and development of situational awareness to develop an understanding of one&#x27;s surroundings, learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs. It may also cover physical and verbal methods to avoid violence whenever possible. It also teaches mental toughness, using controlled scenarios to strengthen mental fortitude in order for students to control the impulse and not do something rash, but instead attack only when necessary and as a last resort.

==Techniques==

Some of the key focuses of techniques in Krav Maga are—as described above—effectiveness and instinctive response under stress. To that end, Krav Maga is an eclectic system that has not sought to replace existing effective techniques, taking what is useful from available systems, for example:

* Strikes – as per karate and boxing
* Takedowns and throws – as per judo, aikido and wrestling
* Ground work – as per judo and wrestling
* Escapes from chokes and holds – as per judo, aikido and wrestling
* Empty-hand weapon defenses – as per aikido

Since the early 21st century, a number of Krav Maga schools have introduced technical influences from other arts as well. These include Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Arnis/Kali/Escrima and Silat. This reflects Krav Maga&#x27;s attitude, across a multitude of lineages, as an ever-evolving style, which continues to borrow ideas and methos from other martial arts.

==History==
Imre &quot;Imi&quot; Lichtenfeld (also known as Imi S&#x27;de-Or) was born in 1910 in Budapest, Austro-Hungary to a Jewish family and grew up in Pozsony, today&#x27;s Bratislava (Slovakia). Lichtenfeld became active in a wide range of sports, including gymnastics, wrestling, and boxing. In 1928, Lichtenfeld won the Slovak Youth Wrestling Championship, and in 1929 the adult championship (light and middle weight divisions). That same year, he also won the national boxing championship and an international gymnastics championship. During the ensuing decade, Lichtenfeld&#x27;s athletic activities focused mainly on wrestling, both as a contestant and a trainer. 

In the mid-1930s, anti-Semitic riots began to threaten the Jews of Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. Lichtenfeld became the leader of a group of Jewish boxers and wrestlers who took to the streets to defend Jewish neighborhoods against the growing numbers of anti-Semitic Nazis. Lichtenfeld quickly discovered, however, that actual fighting was very different from competition fighting, and although boxing and wrestling were good sports, they were not always practical for the aggressive and brutal nature of street combat. It was then that he started to re-evaluate his ideas about fighting and started developing the skills and techniques that would eventually become Krav Maga. Having become a thorn in the side of the equally anti-Semitic local authorities, in 1940 Lichtenfeld left his home with his family and friends on the last refugee ship to escape Europe. 

After making his way to Mandatory Palestine, Lichtenfeld joined the Haganah paramilitary organization. In 1944 Lichtenfeld began training fighters in his areas of expertise: physical fitness, swimming, wrestling, use of the knife, and defense against knife attacks. During this period, Lichtenfeld trained several elite units of the Haganah, including the Palmach (striking force of the Haganah and forerunner of the special units of the Israel Defense Forces) and the Palyam, as well as groups of police officers. 

In 1948, when the State of Israel was founded and the IDF was formed, Lichtenfeld became Chief Instructor for Physical Fitness and Krav Maga at the IDF School of Combat Fitness. He served in the IDF for about 20 years, during which time he developed and refined his unique method for self-defense and hand-to-hand combat. Self-defense was not a new concept, since nearly all martial arts had developed some form of defensive techniques in their quest for tournament or sport dominance. However, self-defense was based strictly upon the scientific and dynamic principles of the human body. In 1965 judo training was added as part of the Krav Maga training. Until 1968 there were no grades in Krav Maga. Then a trainee&#x27;s grades were determined largely by his knowledge in judo.

In 1968, Eli Avikzar, one of Lichtenfeld&#x27;s principal students and first black belt, began learning aikido. In 1971 Eli left for France, where he received a black belt in aikido. Upon his return, Avikzar started working as an instructor alongside Imi to integrate more traditional martial arts into Krav Maga. Then in 1974 Imre retired and gave Eli Avikzar control over the Krav Maga training center in Netanya. Shortly after, in 1976, Avikzar joined the permanent force of IDF, as head of the Krav Maga section. The role of Krav Maga in the army advanced greatly after Eli&#x27;s appointment. More courses were given, and every P.E. instructor was obliged to learn Krav Maga. Avikzar continued to develop Krav Maga within the IDF until his retirement in 1987. Up to this date, Eli had trained 80,000 male soldiers and 12,000 female soldiers.

Further pursuing excellence as a student of martial arts, Eli went to Germany in 1977 and received a black belt in aikido from the European Federation. In 1978 the Krav Maga association was established, and in 1989, as an active member of the judo association, Eli Avikzar helped to contribute to the general development of professional and rank committees within the larger Krav Maga community by founding the Israeli Krav Magen Association (KAMI). KAMI is a parallel discipline to the original Krav Maga. Eli retired as the Chief Krav Maga instructor in 1987 and Boaz Aviram became the third person to hold the position, being the last head instructor to have studied directly with both Lichtenfeld and Avikzar.

==Israel Defense Forces==
The IDF offers a five-week Krav Maga instructor course. It has held an annual Krav Maga competition since May 2013.

==Civilian use==
Upon Imi Lichtenfeld&#x27;s retirement from the IDF, he decided to open a school and teach Krav Maga to civilians.
The first Krav Maga course took place at the Wingate Institute, Netanya, Israel, in 1971, under his direct supervision.

===Grading system===
Most of the Krav Maga organizations in Israel use Imi Lichtenfeld&#x27;s colored belt grading system which is based upon the Judo ranking system. It starts with white belt, and then yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and black belts. Black belt students can move up the ranks from 1st to 9th Dan. The time and requirements for advancing have some differences between the organizations.

Other organizations that teach Krav Maga in and outside of Israel use similar grading systems.

A patch system was developed by Eyal Yanilov in the late 1980s. The grades are divided into three main categories: Practitioner, Graduate and Expert. Each of the categories, which are often abbreviated to their initials, has five ranks. Grades P1 through to P5 are the student levels and make up the majority of the Krav Maga community. After P5 are G1–G5, and in order to achieve Graduate level the student has to demonstrate a proficiency in all of the P level techniques before advancing.


Although there are some subtle differences, the various organizations teach the same core techniques and principles. Some other organizations have less formal grading ranks without belts or patches but do have levels by which students can monitor their progress.

===Sparring===
In some organizations, sparring is slow and light until the student reaches G2 level. This takes approximately four to six years because rising one level in the Practitioner and Graduate categories takes at minimum half a year of consistent training. It is, however, more common to observe regular trainees grading only once a year from P3 and up.

Once in G2, students also practice simulated &quot;real&quot; fighting with protective gear.

<doc id="16802" wikidata="Q1315973" url="?curid=16802" title="The Katzenjammer Kids">
<text>The Katzenjammer Kids is an American comic strip created by Rudolph Dirks in 1897 and later drawn by Harold Knerr for 35 years (1914 to 1949). It debuted on December 12, 1897, in the &quot;American Humorist&quot;, the Sunday supplement of William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot;. The comic strip was turned into a stage play in 1903. It inspired several animated cartoons and was one of 20 strips included in the Comic Strip Classics series of U.S. commemorative postage stamps.

After a series of legal battles between 1912 and 1914, Dirks left the Hearst organization and began a new strip, first titled Hans and Fritz and then The Captain and the Kids. It featured the same characters seen in &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, which was continued by Knerr. The two separate versions of the strip competed with each other until 1979, when &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; ended its six-decade run. &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; published its last original strip in 2006, but is still distributed in reprints by King Features Syndicate, making it the oldest comic strip still in syndication and the longest-running ever.

==History==
===Creation and early years===

&quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; was inspired by &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;, a children&#x27;s story of the 1860s by German author Wilhelm Busch.

&quot;Katzenjammer&quot; translates literally as &quot;the wailing of cats&quot; - i.e. &quot;caterwaul&quot;. However, it is also used to mean &quot;contrition after a failed endeavor&quot; or &quot;hangover&quot; in German (and, in the latter sense, in English too). Whereas Max &amp; Moritz were grotesquely but comically put to death after seven destructive pranks, the Katzenjammer Kids and the other characters still thrive.

===Dirks and Knerr===
&quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; was so popular that it became two competing comic strips and the subject of a lawsuit. This happened because Dirks, in 1912, wanted to take a break after drawing the strip for 15 years, but the Hearst newspaper syndicate would not allow it. Dirks left anyway, and the strip was taken over by Harold Knerr. Dirks&#x27; last strip appeared March 16, 1913. Various ghost artists then apparently did the strip for a few months. Dirks sued, and after a long legal battle, the Hearst papers were allowed to continue &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, with Knerr as writer and artist. He took over permanently in the summer of 1914, but Dirks was allowed to create an almost identical strip of his own for the rival Pulitzer newspapers, although he had to use a different name for the strip.

===&quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot;===

Initially named &quot;Hans und Fritz&quot; after the two naughty protagonist brothers, Dirks&#x27; new feature debuted on June 7, 1914. It was called &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; from 1918 on. &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; was very similar to &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; in terms of content and characters, but Dirks had a looser and more verbal style than Knerr, who on the other hand often produced stronger, more direct gags and drawings. &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; soon proved equal in popularity to &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;. It was later distributed by the United Feature Syndicate, while Hearst&#x27;s King Features distributed &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;.

===1950s to the present===
&quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; expanded as a daily strip during the 1930s, but it had only a short run. However, the Sunday strip remained popular for decades. From 1946, Dirks&#x27; son, John Dirks, gradually began doing more of the work on &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot;. They introduced new characters and plots during the 1950s, including a 1958 science fiction storyline about a brilliant inventor and alien invasions. Even as John Dirks took over most of the work, Rudolph Dirks signed the strip until his death in 1968. John Dirks&#x27; drawing shifted slightly towards a more square-formed line, though it maintained the original style until &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; ended its run in 1979.

Knerr continued drawing &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; until his death in 1949; the strip was then written and drawn by C.H. &quot;Doc&quot; Winner (1949–1956), with Joe Musial taking over in 1956. Musial was replaced on &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; by Mike Senich (1976–1981), Angelo DeCesare (1981–1986), and Hy Eisman (1986–2006). Now syndicated in reprint form, the strip is distributed internationally to some 50 newspapers and magazines. Eisman reused a lot of old gags and stories in later years.

== Characters and story ==
&quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; (three brothers in the first strip but soon reduced to two) featured Hans and Fritz, twins who rebelled against authority, particularly in the form of their mother, Mama; der Captain, a sailor who acted as a surrogate father; and der Inspector, a long-bearded school official. Other characters included John Silver, a pirate sea captain; the Herring Brothers, John Silver&#x27;s three-man crew; and King Bongo, a primitive-living but sophisticated-acting Black jungle monarch who ruled a tropical island.

As originally created, Mama&#x27;s husband was Papa Katzenjammer, her brother was the bungling sailor Heinie, and der Captain–introduced in 1902—was Heinie&#x27;s boss. After a short while, Papa was dropped from the strip without explanation, with der Captain taking over his function. By the 1940s, der Captain and Mama were often presented as a de facto couple.

The immediate Katzenjammer family usually spoke stereotypical German-accented English. When first introduced, der Captain and der Inspector did not, but within months adopted the accent as well. During World Wars I and II, when the United States was at war with Germany, the Katzenjammer family were temporarily presented as Dutch.

The defining theme of the strip was Hans and Fritz pranking der Captain, der Inspector, Mama, or all three, for which the boys were often spanked, but sometimes shifted the blame to others. Other stories involved der Captain taking the Katzenjammers on treasure hunts or cargo voyages, sometimes aided by or competing with John Silver. Still other stories involved King Bongo enlisting the Katzenjammers to run errands or go on missions related to his kingdom; in both strips, by the mid-1930s, the family lived on Bongo&#x27;s island—usually called Squee-Jee—and were readily at hand.

Knerr&#x27;s version of &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; introduced several major new characters in the 1930s. Miss Twiddle, a pompous tutor, and her brainy niece Lena came to stay permanently with the Katzenjammers in early 1936. Later in the year, Twiddle&#x27;s ex-pupil, &quot;boy prodigy&quot; Rollo Rhubarb joined them. The ever-smug Rollo is always trying to outwit Hans and Fritz, but his cunning plans often backfire.

&quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; also introduced some new characters. Ginga Dun is a snooty Indian trader who can outsmart almost anyone and only talks in verse. Captain Bloodshot is a pint-sized pirate rival of John Silver.

Notable features of the later strips, at both syndicates, included a more constructive relationship between the Captain and the boys, who sometimes bickered like friendly rivals rather than pranking each other outright. The King and his people, also in both strips, were now Polynesian rather than African.

== In other media ==


=== &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; ===
====Live-action films====
The &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot; characters initially appeared outside comics in two live-action silent films. The first film, titled &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids in School&quot; released in 1898, was made for the Biograph Company by William George Bitzer. The second film, titled &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids in Love&quot;, was released in 1900.
====Theatrical animated shorts====
Between December 1916 and August 1918, a total of 37 &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot; silent cartoon shorts were produced by William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s own cartoon studio International Film Service, which adapted Hearst&#x27;s well-known comic strips. The series was retired in 1918 at the height of the characters&#x27; popularity – partly because of the growing tension against titles with German associations after World War I. The comic strip was briefly renamed &quot;The Shenanigan Kids&quot; around this time, and in 1920 another five cartoons were produced under this title. All &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot;/&quot;Shenanigan Kids&quot; cartoons from International Film Services were directed (and most likely also animated) by Gregory La Cava. The series was transferred and continued by Bray Productions in 1920.

====Television====
The Katzenjammer Kids also appeared (along with other King Features comic-strip stars) in Hal Seeger&#x27;s TV special &quot;Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter&quot; (1972).

=== &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; ===
====Theatrical animated shorts====
In 1938, &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; became the subject of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s first self-produced series of theatrical short subject cartoons, directed by William Hanna, Bob Allen and Friz Freleng. Unlike the strip, which focused most of all on the gruesomely amusing antics of Hans and Fritz, the MGM cartoons often centered on the Captain. The series was overall unsuccessful, ending after one year and a total of 15 cartoons. Following that cancellation, Freleng returned to Warner Bros., where he had earlier been an animation director. The Captain was voiced by Billy Bletcher, Mama was voiced by Martha Wentworth, and John Silver was voiced by Mel Blanc.

====Television====
&quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; version of the strip was also animated for television as a back-up segment on Filmation&#x27;s &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Funnies&quot; in 1971, and in the spin-off series &quot;Fabulous Funnies&quot; from 1978 to 1979.

* &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; are still very popular in Denmark and Norway (where they are known as &quot;Knoll og Tott&quot;); in both countries, an annual comic book has been published almost every Christmas since 1911 (the only exceptions reportedly being 1913 and 1944). For the most part, Harold Knerr&#x27;s version of the comic is used in these annual comic books. In Sweden, the annual Katzenjammer Kids comic book was also a tradition for many years, from 1928 to 1977.
* Art Clokey, the creator of Gumby, has claimed that &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; inspired the creation of Gumby&#x27;s nemeses, The Block-heads.
* &quot;Playboy&quot; frequently featured in its late 1970s-early 1980s &quot;Playboy Funnies&quot; pages a spoof of &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, called &quot;The Krautzenbummer Kids&quot;, with adult-style gags.
* French dark cabaret band Katzenjammer Kabarett is named in a homage to the strip, as is the Norwegian symphonic pop/swing group &quot;Katzenjammer&quot;.
* Deputy Barney Fife makes a reference to the Katzenjammer Kids in the third season of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, in the episode titled &quot;Andy and the New Mayor&quot;. It is also referenced in season 1 episode &quot;The Inspector&quot;, and in season 3, &quot;Andy&#x27;s Rich Girfriend&quot;.
* In the film, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;, Lt. Archie Hicox is interviewed by Gen. Ed Fenech. Reading his briefing notes, Gen. Fenech states, &quot;It says here that you speak German fluently&quot;. To this, Lt. Hicox reassures the general by saying, &quot;Like a Katzenjammer Kid&quot;.
* In the documentary film, &quot;Poto and Cabengo&quot;, narrator Jean-Pierre Gorin makes references to The Katzenjammer Kids.
* In an episode of &quot;American Dad!&quot; titled &quot;Black Mystery Month&quot;, Steve Smith reads a Katzenjammer Kids comic in an old newspaper.
* In a season 5 episode of &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, Joel Maisel tells Suzie Meyerson that she&#x27;s not cute even though she dresses like a &quot;Katzenjammer Kid&quot;.

=== &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; ===
* &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; has been published as an annual comic book in Norway since 1987. When no more reproducible material was available in 2001, Per Sanderhage, the editor of the Danish comic strip agency PIB, negotiated a deal where &quot;Ferd&#x27;nand&quot; cartoonist Henrik Rehr would redraw 32 pages loosely based on old magazine clippings for the annual. This arrangement continues to this day.

<text>In organic chemistry, a ketone is an organic compound with the structure , where R and R&#x27; can be a variety of carbon-containing substituents. Ketones contain a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond C=O). The simplest ketone is acetone (where R and R&#x27; are methyl), with the formula . Many ketones are of great importance in biology and industry. Examples include many sugars (ketoses), many steroids (e.g., testosterone), and the solvent acetone.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The word &quot;ketone&quot; is derived from &quot;Aketon&quot;, an old German word for &quot;acetone&quot;.

According to the rules of IUPAC nomenclature, ketone names are derived by changing the suffix &quot;-ane&quot; of the parent alkane to &quot;-anone&quot;. Typically, the position of the carbonyl group is denoted by a number, but traditional nonsystematic names are still generally used for the most important ketones, for example acetone and benzophenone. These nonsystematic names are considered retained IUPAC names, although some introductory chemistry textbooks use systematic names such as &quot;2-propanone&quot; or &quot;propan-2-one&quot; for the simplest ketone () instead of &quot;acetone&quot;.

The derived names of ketones are obtained by writing separately the names of the two alkyl groups attached to the carbonyl group, followed by &quot;ketone&quot; as a separate word. Traditionally the names of the alkyl groups were written in order of increasing complexity, for example methyl ethyl ketone. However, according to the rules of IUPAC nomenclature, the alkyl groups are written alphabetically, for example ethyl methyl ketone. When the two alkyl groups are the same, the prefix &quot;di-&quot; is added before the name of alkyl group. The positions of other groups are indicated by Greek letters, the α-carbon being the atom adjacent to carbonyl group.

Although used infrequently, &quot;oxo&quot; is the IUPAC nomenclature for the oxo group (=O) and used as prefix when the ketone does not have the highest priority. Other prefixes, however, are also used. For some common chemicals (mainly in biochemistry), &quot;keto&quot; refer to the ketone functional group.

==Structure and bonding==
The ketone carbon is often described as sp2 hybridized, a description that includes both their electronic and molecular structure. Ketones are trigonal planar around the ketonic carbon, with C–C–O and C–C–C bond angles of approximately 120°. Ketones differ from aldehydes in that the carbonyl group (C=O) is bonded to two carbons within a carbon skeleton. In aldehydes, the carbonyl is bonded to one carbon and one hydrogen and are located at the ends of carbon chains. Ketones are also distinct from other carbonyl-containing functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, esters and amides.

The carbonyl group is polar because the electronegativity of the oxygen is greater than that for carbon. Thus, ketones are nucleophilic at oxygen and electrophilic at carbon. Because the carbonyl group interacts with water by hydrogen bonding, ketones are typically more soluble in water than the related methylene compounds. Ketones are hydrogen-bond acceptors. Ketones are not usually hydrogen-bond donors and cannot hydrogen-bond to themselves. Because of their inability to serve both as hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, ketones tend not to &quot;self-associate&quot; and are more volatile than alcohols and carboxylic acids of comparable molecular weights. These factors relate to the pervasiveness of ketones in perfumery and as solvents.

===Classes of ketones===
Ketones are classified on the basis of their substituents. One broad classification subdivides ketones into symmetrical and unsymmetrical derivatives, depending on the equivalency of the two organic substituents attached to the carbonyl center. Acetone and benzophenone () are symmetrical ketones. Acetophenone is an unsymmetrical ketone.

====Diketones====

Many kinds of diketones are known, some with unusual properties. The simplest is diacetyl , once used as butter-flavoring in popcorn. Acetylacetone (pentane-2,4-dione) is virtually a misnomer (inappropriate name) because this species exists mainly as the monoenol . Its enolate is a common ligand in coordination chemistry.

====Unsaturated ketones====
Ketones containing alkene and alkyne units are often called unsaturated ketones. A widely used member of this class of compounds is methyl vinyl ketone, , a α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

====Cyclic ketones====
Many ketones are cyclic. The simplest class have the formula , where &quot;n&quot; varies from 2 for cyclopropanone () to the tens. Larger derivatives exist. Cyclohexanone (), a symmetrical cyclic ketone, is an important intermediate in the production of nylon. Isophorone, derived from acetone, is an unsaturated, asymmetrical ketone that is the precursor to other polymers. Muscone, 3-methylpentadecanone, is an animal pheromone. Another cyclic ketone is cyclobutanone, having the formula .

==Characterization==
An aldehyde differs from a ketone in that it has a hydrogen atom attached to its carbonyl group, making aldehydes easier to oxidize. Ketones do not have a hydrogen atom bonded to the carbonyl group, and are therefore more resistant to oxidation. They are oxidized only by powerful oxidizing agents which have the ability to cleave carbon–carbon bonds.

===Spectroscopy===
Ketones (and aldehydes) absorb strongly in the infra-red spectrum near 1750 cm−1, which is assigned to νC=O (&quot;carbonyl stretching frequency&quot;). The energy of the peak is lower for aryl and unsaturated ketones.

Whereas 1H NMR spectroscopy is generally not useful for establishing the presence of a ketone, 13C NMR spectra exhibit signals somewhat downfield of 200 ppm depending on structure. Such signals are typically weak due to the absence of nuclear Overhauser effects. Since aldehydes resonate at similar chemical shifts, multiple resonance experiments are employed to definitively distinguish aldehydes and ketones.

===Qualitative organic tests===

Ketones give positive results in Brady&#x27;s test, the reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to give the corresponding hydrazone. Ketones may be distinguished from aldehydes by giving a negative result with Tollens&#x27; reagent or with Fehling&#x27;s solution. Methyl ketones give positive results for the iodoform test. Ketones also give positive results when treated with &quot;m&quot;-dinitrobenzene in presence of dilute sodium hydroxide to give violet coloration.

==Synthesis==
Many methods exist for the preparation of ketones in industrial scale and academic laboratories. Ketones are also produced in various ways by organisms; see the section on biochemistry below.

In industry, the most important method probably involves oxidation of hydrocarbons, often with air. For example, a billion kilograms of cyclohexanone are produced annually by aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane. Acetone is prepared by air-oxidation of cumene.

For specialized or small scale organic synthetic applications, ketones are often prepared by oxidation of secondary alcohols:
Typical strong oxidants (source of &quot;O&quot; in the above reaction) include potassium permanganate or a Cr(VI) compound. Milder conditions make use of the Dess–Martin periodinane or the Moffatt–Swern methods.

Many other methods have been developed, examples include:
* By geminal halide hydrolysis.
* By hydration of alkynes. Such processes occur via enols and require the presence of an acid and mercury(II) sulfate (). Subsequent enol–keto tautomerization gives a ketone. This reaction always produces a ketone, even with a terminal alkyne, the only exception being the hydration of acetylene, which produces acetaldehyde.
* From Weinreb amides using stoichiometric organometallic reagents.
* Aryl ketones can be prepared in the Friedel–Crafts acylation, the related Houben–Hoesch reaction, and the Fries rearrangement.
* Ozonolysis, and related dihydroxylation/oxidative sequences, cleave alkenes to give aldehydes or ketones, depending on alkene substitution pattern.
* From peroxides (Kornblum–DeLaMare rearrangement).
* Cyclization of dicarboxylic acids (Ruzicka cyclization)
* Hydrolysis of salts of secondary nitro compounds ( Nef reaction)
* Alkylation of thioester with organozinc compounds (Fukuyama coupling).
* Alkylation of acid chloride with organocadmium compounds or organocopper compounds.
* The Dakin–West reaction provides an efficient method for preparation of certain methyl ketones from carboxylic acids.
* Ketones can be prepared by the reaction of Grignard reagents with nitriles, followed by hydrolysis.
* By decarboxylation of carboxylic anhydride.
* Ketones can be prepared from haloketones in reductive dehalogenation of halo ketones.
* In ketonic decarboxylation symmetrical ketones are prepared from carboxylic acids.
* Hydrolysis of unsaturated secondary amides, β-Keto acid esters, or β-diketones (the acetoacetic ester synthesis). 
* Acid-catalysed rearrangement of 1,2-diols, or Criegee oxidation of the same.

==Reactions==
===Keto-enol tautomerization===
Ketones that have at least one alpha-hydrogen, undergo keto-enol tautomerization; the tautomer is an enol. Tautomerization is catalyzed by both acids and bases. Usually, the keto form is more stable than the enol. This equilibrium allows ketones to be prepared via the hydration of alkynes.

===Acid/base properties of ketones===
 bonds adjacent to the carbonyl in ketones are more acidic p&quot;K&quot;a ≈ 20) than the bonds in alkane (p&quot;K&quot;a ≈ 50). This difference reflects resonance stabilization of the enolate ion that is formed upon deprotonation. The relative acidity of the α-hydrogen is important in the enolization reactions of ketones and other carbonyl compounds. The acidity of the α-hydrogen also allows ketones and other carbonyl compounds to react as nucleophiles at that position, with either stoichiometric and catalytic base. Using very strong bases like lithium diisopropylamide (LDA, p&quot;K&quot;a of conjugate acid ~36) under non-equilibrating conditions (–78 °C, 1.1 equiv LDA in THF, ketone added to base), the less-substituted &quot;kinetic&quot; &quot;enolate&quot; is generated selectively, while conditions that allow for equilibration (higher temperature, base added to ketone, using weak or insoluble bases, e.g.,  in , or NaH) provides the more-substituted &quot;thermodynamic enolate&quot;.

Ketones are also weak bases, undergoing protonation on the carbonyl oxygen in the presence of Brønsted acids. Ketonium ions (i.e., protonated ketones) are strong acids, with p&quot;K&quot;a values estimated to be somewhere between –5 and –7. Although acids encountered in organic chemistry are seldom strong enough to fully protonate ketones, the formation of equilibrium concentrations of protonated ketones is nevertheless an important step in the mechanisms of many common organic reactions, like the formation of an acetal, for example. Acids as weak as pyridinium cation (as found in pyridinium tosylate) with a p&quot;K&quot;a of 5.2 are able to serve as catalysts in this context, despite the highly unfavorable equilibrium constant for protonation (&quot;K&quot;eq &lt; 10−10).

===Nucleophilic additions===
An important set of reactions follow from the susceptibility of the carbonyl carbon toward nucleophilic addition and the tendency for the enolates to add to electrophiles.
Nucleophilic additions include in approximate order of their generality:
* With water (hydration) gives geminal diols, which are usually not formed in appreciable (or observable) amounts
* With an acetylide to give the α-hydroxyalkyne
* With ammonia or a primary amine gives an imine
* With secondary amine gives an enamine
* With Grignard and organolithium reagents to give, after aqueous workup, a tertiary alcohol
* With an alcohols or alkoxides to gives the hemiketal or its conjugate base. With a diol to the ketal. This reaction is employed to protect ketones.
* With sodium amide resulting in C–C bond cleavage with formation of the amide RCONH2 and the alkane or arene R&#x27;H, a reaction called the Haller–Bauer reaction.

===Oxidation===

Ketones are cleaved by strong oxidizing agents and at elevated temperatures. Their oxidation involves carbon–carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic acids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone. 

===Other reactions===
* Electrophilic addition, reaction with an electrophile gives a resonance stabilized cation
* With phosphonium ylides in the Wittig reaction to give the alkenes
* With thiols to give the thioacetal
* With hydrazine or 1-disubstituted derivatives of hydrazine to give hydrazones.
* With a metal hydride gives a metal alkoxide salt, hydrolysis of which gives the alcohol, an example of ketone reduction
* With halogens to form an α-haloketone, a reaction that proceeds via an enol (see Haloform reaction)
* With heavy water to give an α-deuterated ketone
* Fragmentation in photochemical Norrish reaction
* Reaction of 1,4-aminodiketones to oxazoles by dehydration in the Robinson–Gabriel synthesis
* In the case of aryl–alkyl ketones, with sulfur and an amine give amides in the Willgerodt reaction
* With hydroxylamine to produce oximes
* With reducing agents to form secondary alcohols
* With peroxy acids to form esters in the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation

==Biochemistry==

Ketones do not appear in standard amino acids, nucleic acids, nor lipids. The formation of organic compounds in photosynthesis occurs via the ketone ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Many sugars are ketones, known collectively as ketoses. The best known ketose is fructose; it mostly exists as a cyclic hemiketal, which masks the ketone functional group. Fatty acid synthesis proceeds via ketones. Acetoacetate is an intermediate in the Krebs cycle which releases energy from sugars and carbohydrates.

In medicine, acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate are collectively called ketone bodies, generated from carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids in most vertebrates, including humans. Ketone bodies are elevated in the blood (ketosis) after fasting, including a night of sleep; in both blood and urine in starvation; in hypoglycemia, due to causes other than hyperinsulinism; in various inborn errors of metabolism, and intentionally induced via a ketogenic diet, and in ketoacidosis (usually due to diabetes mellitus). Although ketoacidosis is characteristic of decompensated or untreated type 1 diabetes, ketosis or even ketoacidosis can occur in type 2 diabetes in some circumstances as well.

==Applications==
Ketones are produced on massive scales in industry as solvents, polymer precursors, and pharmaceuticals. In terms of scale, the most important ketones are acetone, methylethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone. They are also common in biochemistry, but less so than in organic chemistry in general. The combustion of hydrocarbons is an uncontrolled oxidation process that gives ketones as well as many other types of compounds.

==Toxicity==
Although it is difficult to generalize on the toxicity of such a broad class of compounds, simple ketones are, in general, not highly toxic. This characteristic is one reason for their popularity as solvents. Exceptions to this rule are the unsaturated ketones such as methyl vinyl ketone with of 7 mg/kg (oral).

<text>In organic chemistry, a ketene is an organic compound of the form , where R and R&#x27; are two arbitrary monovalent chemical groups (or two separate substitution sites in the same molecule). The name may also refer to the specific compound ethenone , the simplest ketene.

Although they are highly useful, most ketenes are unstable. When used as reagents in a chemical procedure, they are typically generated when needed, and consumed as soon as (or while) they are produced.

==History==
Ketenes were first studied as a class by Hermann Staudinger before 1905.

Ketenes were systematically investigated by Hermann Staudinger in 1905 in the form of diphenylketene (conversion of formula_1-chlorodiphenyl acetyl chloride with zinc). Staudinger was inspired by the first examples of reactive organic intermediates and stable radicals discovered by Moses Gomberg in 1900 (compounds with triphenylmethyl group).

==Properties==
Ketenes are highly electrophilic at the carbon atom bonded with the heteroatom, due to its &quot;sp&quot; character. Ketene can be formed with different heteroatom bonded to the &quot;sp&quot; carbon atom, such as O, S or Se, respectively named ketene, thioketene and selenoketene.

Ethenone, the simplest ketene, has different experimental lengths for each of the double bonds; the C=O bond is 1.160Å and the C=C bond is 1.314Å. The angle between the two H atoms is 121.5°, similar to the theoretically ideal angle formed in alkenes between &quot;sp2 &quot;carbon atom and H substituents.

Ketenes are unstable and cannot be stored. In the absence of nucleophiles with which to react, ethenone dimerises to give β-lactone, a cyclic ester. If the ketene is disubstituted, the dimerisation product is a substituted cyclobutadione. For monosubstituted ketenes, the dimerisation could afford either the ester or the diketone product.

==Synthesis==
Ketene is produced on a commercial scale by thermal dehydration of acetic acid. Substituted ketenes can be prepared from acyl chlorides by an elimination reaction in which HCl is lost:
In this reaction, a base, usually triethylamine, removes the acidic proton alpha to the carbonyl group, inducing the formation of the carbon-carbon double bond and the loss of a chloride ion:

Ketenes can also be formed from α-diazoketones by the Wolff rearrangement, and from vinylene carbonate by phosphorus(V) sulfide and irradiation.

Another way to generate ketenes is through flash vacuum thermolysis (FVT) with 2-pyridylamines. Plüg and Wentrup developed a method in 1997 that improved on FVT reactions to produce ketenes with a stable FVT that is moisture insensitive, using mild conditions (480 °C). The N-pyridylamines are prepared via a condensation with R-malonates with N-amino(pyridene) and DCC as the solvent.

A more robust method for preparing ketenes is the carbonylation of metal-carbenes, and &quot;in situ&quot; reaction of the thus produced highly reactive ketenes with suitable reagents such as imines, amines, or alcohols. This method is an efficient one‐pot tandem protocol of the carbonylation of α‐diazocarbonyl compounds and a variety of &quot;N&quot;‐tosylhydrazones catalysed by Co(II)–porphyrin metalloradicals leading to the formation of ketenes, which subsequently react with a variety of nucleophiles and imines to form esters, amides and β‐lactams. This system has a broad substrate scope and can be applied to various combinations of carbene precursors, nucleophiles and imines.

Ethenone can be produced through pyrolysis of acetone vapours over a hot filament in an apparatus that was eventually developed into the &quot;ketene lamp&quot; or &quot;Hurd lamp&quot; (named for Charles D. Hurd).

==Reactions and applications==
Due to their cumulated double bonds, ketenes are very reactive.

=== Formation of carboxylic acid esters ===
By reaction with alcohols, carboxylic acid esters are formed:

=== Formation of carboxylic anhydrides ===
Ketenes react with a carboxylic acids to form carboxylic acid anhydrides:

=== Formation of amides ===
Ketenes react with ammonia and amines to give the corresponding amides:

=== Hydrolysis ===
By reaction with water, carboxylic acids are formed from ketenes

=== Formation of enol esters ===
Enol esters are formed from ketenes with enolisable carbonyl compounds. The following example shows the reaction of ethenone with acetone to form a propen-2-yl acetate:

=== Dimerisation ===
At room temperature, ketene quickly dimerizes to diketene, but the ketene can be recovered by heating:

=== [2+2]-cycloaddition ===
Ketenes can react with alkenes, carbonyl compounds, carbodiimides and imines in a [2+2] cycloaddition. The example shows the synthesis of a β-lactam by the reaction of a ketene with an imine (see Staudinger synthesis):

===Applications===
Ketenes are generally very reactive, and participate in various ketene cycloadditions. One important process is the dimerization to give propiolactones. A specific example is the dimerization of the ketene of stearic acid to afford alkyl ketene dimers, which are widely used in the paper industry. AKD&#x27;s react with the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose via esterification reaction.

They will also undergo [2+2] cycloaddition reactions with electron-rich alkynes to form cyclobutenones, or carbonyl groups to form beta-lactones. With imines, beta-lactams are formed. This is the Staudinger synthesis, a facile route to this important class of compounds. With acetone, ketene reacts to give isopropenyl acetate.

A variety of hydroxylic compounds can add as nucleophiles, forming either enol or ester products. As examples, a water molecule easily adds to ketene to give 1,1-dihydroxyethene and acetic anhydride is produced by the reaction of acetic acid with ketene. Reactions between diols () and bis-ketenes () yield polyesters with a repeat unit of ().

Ethyl acetoacetate, an important starting material in organic synthesis, can be prepared using a diketene in reaction with ethanol. They directly form ethyl acetoacetate, and the yield is high when carried out under controlled circumstances; this method is therefore used industrially.

<doc id="16806" wikidata="Q11687242" url="?curid=16806" title="Kistvaen">
<text>A kistvaen or cistvaen is a tomb or burial chamber formed from flat stone slabs in a box-like shape. If set completely underground, it may be covered by a &quot;tumulus&quot;. The word is derived from the Welsh &quot;cist&quot; (chest) and &quot;maen&quot; (stone). The term originated in relation to Celtic structures, typically pre-Christian, but in antiquarian scholarship of the 19th and early 20th centuries it was sometimes applied to similar structures outside the Celtic world.

One of the most numerous kinds of kistvaen are the Dartmoor kistvaens. These often take the form of small rectangular pits about 3 ft. (0.9 m) long by 2 feet (0.6 m) wide. The kistvaens were usually covered with a mound of earth and surrounded by a circle of small stones. When a body was placed in the kistvaen, it was usually lain in a contracted position. Sometimes however the body was cremated with the ashes placed in a cinerary urn.

==Kistvaens and Celtic saints==
Kistvaens are also found associated with holy sites or burial places of early Celtic saints, who are often semi-legendary. Saints associated with kistvaens include Callwen daughter of Brychan, Geraint, Begnet, and Melangell. Foundation remains of stone slab- or gable-shrines, or the &quot;cella memoriae&quot; of Mediterranean origin, may sometimes have been misunderstood in an earlier era of scholarship as a kistvaen, and the subject is complicated by this &quot;woolly nomenclature.&quot;

<doc id="16807" wikidata="Q130779" url="?curid=16807" title="Kim Stanley Robinson">
<text>Kim Stanley Robinson (born March 23, 1952) is an American science fiction writer best known for his &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy. Many of his novels and stories have ecological, cultural, and political themes and feature scientists as heroes. Robinson has won numerous awards, including the Hugo Award for Best Novel, the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the World Fantasy Award. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; has called Robinson&#x27;s work &quot;the gold standard of realistic, and highly literary, science-fiction writing.&quot; According to an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Robinson is &quot;generally acknowledged as one of the greatest living science-fiction writers.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Robinson was born in Waukegan, Illinois. He moved to Southern California as a child.

In 1974, he earned a B.A. in literature from the University of California, San Diego. In 1975, he earned an M.A. in English from Boston University. In 1978 Robinson moved to Davis, California, to take a break from his graduate studies at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego). During this time, he worked as a bookseller for Orpheus Books. He also taught freshman composition and other courses at University of California, Davis.

In 1982, Robinson earned a PhD in English from UC San Diego. His original PhD advisor was literary critic and Marxist scholar Fredric Jameson, who had pointed Robinson toward works by Philip K. Dick. Jameson described Dick to his student as &quot;the greatest living American writer&quot;. Jameson moved to UC Santa Cruz and Robinson finished his doctoral thesis under Donald Wesling. The dissertation was entitled &quot;The Novels of Philip K. Dick&quot;.

==Career==
In 2009, Robinson was an instructor at the Clarion Workshop. In 2010, he was the guest of honor at the 68th World Science Fiction Convention, held in Melbourne. In April 2011, Robinson presented at the second annual Rethinking Capitalism conference, held at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Among other points made, his talk addressed the cyclical nature of capitalism.

Robinson was appointed as a Muir Environmental Fellow in 2011 by John Muir College at UC San Diego.

==Major themes==
===Nature and culture===
Sheldon Brown described Robinson&#x27;s novels as ways to explore how nature and culture continuously reformulate one another; &quot;Three Californias Trilogy&quot; as California in the future; Washington DC undergoing the impact of climate change in the &quot;Science in the Capital&quot; series; or Mars as a stand-in for Earth in the &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy to think about re-engineering on a global scale, both social and natural conditions.

===Ecological sustainability===
Virtually all of Robinson&#x27;s novels have an ecological component; sustainability is one of his primary themes (a strong contender for the primary theme would be the nature of a plausible utopia). The &quot;Orange County&quot; trilogy is about the way in which the technological intersects with the natural, highlighting the importance of keeping the two in balance. In the &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy, one of the principal divisions among the population of Mars is based on dissenting views on terraforming. Colonists debate whether or not the barren Martian landscape has a similar ecological or spiritual value when compared with a living ecosphere like Earth&#x27;s. &quot;Forty Signs of Rain&quot; has an entirely ecological thrust, taking global warming as its principal subject.

===Economic and social justice===
Robinson&#x27;s work often explores alternatives to modern capitalism. In the &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy, it is argued that capitalism is an outgrowth of feudalism, which could be replaced in the future by a more democratic economic system. Worker ownership and cooperatives figure prominently in &quot;Green Mars&quot; and &quot;Blue Mars&quot; as replacements for traditional corporations. The &quot;Orange County&quot; trilogy explores similar arrangements; &quot;Pacific Edge&quot; includes the idea of attacking the legal framework behind corporate domination to promote social egalitarianism. Tim Kreider writes in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; that Robinson may be our greatest political novelist and describes how Robinson uses the &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy as a template for a credible utopia. His works have made reference to real-world examples of economic organization that have been cited as examples of alternatives to conventional capitalist structures, such as the Mondragon Corporation and the Kerala model.

Robinson&#x27;s writing also reflects an interest in economic models that reject the growth-oriented basis of capitalism: Robert Markley has identified the work of Murray Bookchin as an influence on his thinking, as well as steady-state economics.

Robinson&#x27;s work often portrays characters struggling to preserve and enhance the world around them in an environment characterized by individualism and entrepreneurialism, often facing the political and economic authoritarianism of corporate power acting in this environment. Robinson has been described as anti-capitalist, and his work often portrays a form of frontier capitalism that promotes egalitarian ideals that closely resemble socialist systems, but faced with a capitalism that is maintained by entrenched hegemonic corporations. In particular, his Martian Constitution draws upon social democratic ideals explicitly emphasizing a community-participation element in political and economic life.

Robinson&#x27;s works often portray the worlds of tomorrow in a manner similar to the mythologized American Western frontier, showing a sentimental affection for the freedom and wildness of the frontier. This aesthetic includes a preoccupation with competing models of political and economic organization.

The environmental, economic, and social themes in Robinson&#x27;s stand in marked contrast to the right-libertarian science fiction prevalent in much of the genre (Robert A. Heinlein, Poul Anderson, Larry Niven, and Jerry Pournelle being prominent examples). He has been described as &quot;one of America&#x27;s best-selling […] left-wing novelists&quot; and his work has been called &quot;probably the most successful attempt to reach a mass audience with an anti-capitalist utopian vision since Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s 1974 novel, &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;&quot;.

===Scientists as heroes===
Robinson&#x27;s work often features scientists as heroes. They are portrayed in a mundane way compared to most work featuring scientists: rather than being adventurers or action heroes, Robinson&#x27;s scientists become critically important because of research discoveries, networking and collaboration with other scientists, political lobbying, or becoming public figures. Robinson captures the joy of scientists as they work at something they care about. Robert Markley has argued that Robinson &quot;views science as the model for a utopian politics... Even in Robinson&#x27;s novels that don&#x27;t seem to be sci-fi, like &quot;Shaman&quot;, the inductive method, the collective search for greater knowledge about the world that can be put to use for the good for all, is front and center&quot;. The &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot; rely heavily on the idea that scientists must take responsibility for ensuring public understanding and responsible use of their discoveries. Robinson&#x27;s scientists often emerge as the best people to direct public policy on important environmental and technological questions, of which politicians are often ignorant.

===Climate change and global warming===

Related to Robinson&#x27;s focus on the environment are his themes of the imminent catastrophe of global warming and the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the present day. His 2012 novel &quot;2312&quot; explores the detrimental, long-term effects of climate change, which include food shortages, global instability, mass extinction, and sea level rise that has drowned many major coastal cities. The novel condemns the people of the period it calls &quot;the Dithering&quot;, from 2005 to 2060, for failing to address climate change and thereby causing mass suffering and death in the future. Robinson and his work accuse global capitalism for the failure to address climate change. In his 2017 novel &quot;New York 2140&quot; Robinson explores the themes of climate change and global warming, setting the novel in the year 2140 when the New York City he imagines is beset by a sea level rise that submerges half of the city. Climate change is also the focus of his &quot;Science in the Capital&quot; series and his 2020 novel &quot;The Ministry for the Future&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Asteroid 72432 Kimrobinson, discovered by astronomer Donald P. Pray in 2001, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on April 22, 2016 ().

In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Robinson a &quot;Hero of the Environment&quot; for his optimistic focus on the future.

==Personal life==
Robinson and his wife have two sons. Robinson has lived in Washington, D.C., California, and during some of the 1980s, in Switzerland. At times, Robinson was a stay-at-home dad. He later moved to Davis, California, in a cohousing community.

Robinson has described himself as an avid backpacker, with the Sierra Nevada mountains serving as his home range and a big influence on how he sees the world.

Politically, Robinson identifies as a democratic socialist, and in a February 2019 interview mentioned he is a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America. He has also remarked that libertarianism has never &quot;[made] any sense to me, nor sounds attractive as a principle.&quot;

<doc id="16808" wikidata="Q45792" url="?curid=16808" title="King Arthur">
<text>King Arthur (, , , ), according to legends, was a king of Britain. He is a folk hero and a central figure in the medieval literary tradition known as the Matter of Britain.

In Welsh sources, Arthur is portrayed as a leader of the post-Roman Britons in battles against the Anglo-Saxons in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. He first appears in two early medieval historical sources, the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; and the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, but these date to 300 years after he is supposed to have lived, and most historians who study the period do not consider him a historical figure. His name also occurs in early Welsh poetic sources such as &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;. The character developed through Welsh mythology, appearing either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn.

The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s fanciful and imaginative 12th-century &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;). Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire. Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, including Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon, the magician Merlin, Arthur&#x27;s wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur&#x27;s conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. The themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend vary widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed, until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend continues to have prominence, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.

== Historicity ==
King Arthur was traditionally accepted as a historic person. He was originally thought to have been an ancient British war commander, and, at least from the early 12th century, a king. There was, however, much discussion regarding his various deeds, and contemporary scholars and clerics generally refuted the popular medieval belief in his extreme longevity and future return. From the eighteenth century onwards, there has been academic debate about the historicity of Arthur. 

One school of thought, citing entries in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (&quot;History of the Britons&quot;) and &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; (&quot;Welsh Annals&quot;), saw Arthur as a genuine historical figure, a Romano-British leader who fought against the invading Anglo-Saxons some time in the late 5th to early 6th century.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, a 9th-century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius, contains the first datable mention of King Arthur, listing twelve battles that Arthur fought. These culminate in the Battle of Badon, where he is said to have single-handedly killed 960 men. Recent studies question the reliability of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;.

Archaeological evidence in the Low Countries and what was to become England shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill, attributed to Arthur by Nennius. The monks of Glastonbury are also said to have discovered the grave of Arthur in 1180.

The other text that seems to support the case for Arthur&#x27;s historical existence is the 10th-century &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The &quot;Annales&quot; date this battle to 516–518, and also mention the Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537–539. These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the &quot;Historia&quot;″s account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Badon.

Problems have been identified, however, with using this source to support the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;″s account. The latest research shows that the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales. Additionally, the complex textual history of the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early. They were more likely added at some point in the 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;.

This lack of convincing early evidence is the reason many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, &quot;at this stage of the enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [but ...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him&quot;. These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, &quot;The Age of Arthur&quot; (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.

Partly in reaction to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris&#x27;s &quot;Age of Arthur&quot; prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that &quot;no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian&#x27;s time&quot;. Gildas&#x27;s 6th-century polemic &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; (&quot;On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain&quot;), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is not mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede&#x27;s early-8th-century &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. The historian David Dumville wrote: &quot;I think we can dispose of him [Arthur] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a &#x27;no smoke without fire&#x27; school of thought ... The fact of the matter is that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books.&quot;

Some scholars argue that Arthur was originally a fictional hero of folklore—or even a half-forgotten Celtic deity—who became credited with real deeds in the distant past. They cite parallels with figures such as the Kentish Hengist and Horsa, who may be totemic horse-gods that later became historicised. Bede ascribed to these legendary figures a historical role in the 5th-century Anglo-Saxon conquest of eastern Britain. It is not even certain that Arthur was considered a king in the early texts. Neither the &quot;Historia&quot; nor the &quot;Annales&quot; calls him &quot;&quot;rex&quot;: the former calls him instead &quot;dux bellorum&quot; (leader of wars) and &quot;miles&quot;&quot; (soldier).
Details of Arthur&#x27;s story are mainly composed of Welsh mythology, English folklore and literary invention, and most modern historians writing about the period do not think that he was a historical figure. Because historical documents for the post-Roman period are scarce, a definitive answer to the question of Arthur&#x27;s historical existence is unlikely. Sites and places have been identified as &quot;Arthurian&quot; since the 12th century, but archaeology can confidently reveal names only through inscriptions found in secure contexts. The so-called &quot;Arthur stone&quot;, discovered in 1998 among the ruins at Tintagel Castle in Cornwall in securely dated 6th-century contexts, created a brief stir but proved irrelevant. Other inscriptional evidence for Arthur, including the Glastonbury cross, is tainted with the suggestion of forgery.

Andrew Breeze argues that Arthur was a historical character who fought other Britons in the area of the future border between England and Scotland, and claims to have identified the locations of his battles as well as the place and date of his death (in the context of the extreme weather events of 535–536), but his conclusions are disputed. Other scholars have questioned his findings, which they consider are based on coincidental resemblances between place-names. Nicholas Higham comments that it is difficult to justify identifying Arthur as the leader in northern battles listed in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; while rejecting the implication in the same work that they were fought against Anglo-Saxons, and that there is no textual justification for separating Badon from the other battles.

Several historical figures have been proposed as the basis for Arthur, ranging from Lucius Artorius Castus, a Roman officer who served in Britain in the 2nd or 3rd century, to sub-Roman British rulers such as Riotamus, Ambrosius Aurelianus, and the Welsh kings Owain Ddantgwyn, Enniaun Girt, and Athrwys ap Meurig. However, no convincing evidence for these identifications has emerged.

== Name ==

The origin of the Welsh name &quot;Arthur&quot; remains a matter of debate. The most widely accepted etymology derives it from the Roman &quot;nomen gentile&quot; (family name) Artorius. Artorius itself is of obscure and contested etymology. Linguist Stephan Zimmer suggests Artorius possibly had a Celtic origin, being a Latinization of a hypothetical name &quot;*Artorījos&quot;, in turn derived from an older patronym&quot; *Arto-rīg-ios&quot;, meaning &quot;son of the bear/warrior-king&quot;. This patronym is unattested, but the root, &quot;*arto-rīg&quot;, &quot;bear/warrior-king&quot;, is the source of the Old Irish personal name &quot;Artrí&quot;. Some scholars have suggested it is relevant to this debate that the legendary King Arthur&#x27;s name only appears as &quot;Arthur&quot; or &quot;Arturus&quot; in early Latin Arthurian texts, never as &quot;Artōrius&quot; (though Classical Latin Artōrius became Arturius in some Vulgar Latin dialects). Others believe the origin of the name &quot;Arthur&quot;, as &quot;Artōrius&quot; would regularly become &quot;Art(h)ur&quot; when borrowed into Welsh.

Another commonly proposed derivation of &quot;Arthur&quot; from Welsh &quot;arth&quot; &quot;bear&quot; + &quot;(g)wr&quot; &quot;man&quot; (earlier &quot;*Arto-uiros&quot; in Brittonic) is not accepted by modern scholars for phonological and orthographic reasons. Notably, a Brittonic compound name &quot;*Arto-uiros&quot; should produce Old Welsh &quot;*Artgur&quot; (where &quot;u&quot; represents the short vowel /u/) and Middle/Modern Welsh &quot;*Arthwr&quot;, rather than &quot;Arthur&quot; (where &quot;u&quot; is a long vowel /ʉː/). In Welsh poetry the name is always spelled &quot;Arthur&quot; and is exclusively rhymed with words ending in &quot;-ur&quot;—never words ending in &quot;-wr&quot;—which confirms that the second element cannot be &quot;[g]wr&quot; &quot;man&quot;.

An alternative theory, which has gained only limited acceptance among professional scholars, derives the name Arthur from Arcturus, the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, near Ursa Major or the Great Bear. Classical Latin &quot;Arcturus&quot; would also have become &quot;Art(h)ur&quot; when borrowed into Welsh, and its brightness and position in the sky led people to regard it as the &quot;guardian of the bear&quot; (which is the meaning of the name in Ancient Greek) and the &quot;leader&quot; of the other stars in Boötes.

Many other theories exist, for example that the name has Messapian or Etruscan origins.

== Legends concerning the return of Arthur ==
That Arthur never died but is awaiting his return in some remote spot, often sleeping, is a central motif connected to the Arthurian legends. Before the twelfth century there are, as in the &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot;, references to the absence of a grave for Arthur suggesting that he was considered immortal and not dead, but in this poem there is no indication that he was expected to return. From the early twelfth century onwards several sources report a popular belief in the return of King Arthur, although most often critically and mockingly presented. His future return is first mentioned by William of Malmesbury in 1125: &quot;But Arthur&#x27;s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return.&quot; The &quot;Miracles of St. Mary of Laon&quot; (&quot;De miraculis sanctae Mariae Laudunensis&quot;), written by a French cleric and chronicler named Hériman of Tournai about 1145, but referring to events occurring in 1113, mentions the Breton and Cornish belief that Arthur still lived.

In 1191 the alleged tomb of Arthur was identified in an orchestrated discovery at Glastonbury Abbey. Whereas numerous scholars have argued that this could have been due to the Abbey wanting to stand out with an illustrious tomb, or to a desire of the Plantagenet regime to put an end to a legendary rival figure who inspired tenacious Celtic opposition to their rule, it may also have been motivated by how the Arthurian expectations were highly problematic to contemporary Christianity. The longing of the return of a mighty immortal figure returning before the end of time to re-establish his perfect rule, not only ran against basic Catholic tenets but could even threaten the quintessential focus on the longing for the return of Jesus. This was further aggravated by how the stories about Arthur sometimes invoked more emotions than biblical tales. Decades of elite critique of the popular conviction among otherwise pious Catholic Celts in Britain and Brittany had done nothing to suppress these beliefs, whereas the orchestration of Arthur&#x27;s physical remains effectively eliminated the possibility of his return without overtly criticizing anyone&#x27;s beliefs. After the 1191 discovery of his alleged tomb, Arthur became more of a figure of folk legends, found sleeping in various remote caves all over Britain and some other places, and at times, roaming the night as a spectre, like in the Wild Hunt.

== Medieval literary traditions ==
The familiar literary persona of Arthur began with Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudo-historical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), written in the 1130s. The textual sources for Arthur are usually divided into those written before Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; (known as pre-Galfridian texts, from the Latin form of Geoffrey, &quot;Galfridus&quot;) and those written afterwards, which could not avoid his influence (Galfridian, or post-Galfridian, texts).

=== Pre-Galfridian traditions ===
The earliest literary references to Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There have been few attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, rather than in a single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey led by Caitlin Green has identified three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.

One of the most famous Welsh poetic references to Arthur comes in the collection of heroic death-songs known as &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; (&quot;The Gododdin&quot;), attributed to the 6th-century poet Aneirin. One stanza from the oldest surviving manuscript praises the bravery of a warrior who slew 300 enemies, but says that despite this, &quot;he was no Arthur,&quot; i.e., his feats cannot compare to Arthur. &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; is known only from a 13th-century manuscript, so it is impossible to determine whether this passage is original or a later interpolation, but John Koch&#x27;s view that the passage dates from a 7th-century or earlier version is regarded as unproven; 9th- or 10th-century dates are often proposed for it. Several poems attributed to Taliesin, a poet said to have lived in the 6th century, also refer to Arthur, although these all probably date from between the 8th and 12th centuries. They include &quot;Kadeir Teyrnon&quot; (&quot;The Chair of the Prince&quot;), which refers to &quot;Arthur the Blessed&quot;; &quot;Preiddeu Annwn&quot; (&quot;The Spoils of Annwn&quot;), which recounts an expedition of Arthur to the Otherworld; and &quot;Marwnat vthyr pen[dragon]&quot; (&quot;The Elegy of Uther Pen[dragon]&quot;), which refers to Arthur&#x27;s valour and is suggestive of a father-son relationship for Arthur and Uther that pre-dates Geoffrey of Monmouth.

Other early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the &quot;Black Book of Carmarthen&quot;, &quot;Pa gur yv y porthaur?&quot; (&quot;What man is the gatekeeper?&quot;). This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere).

In addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;. In particular, Arthur features in a number of well-known &quot;vitae&quot; (&quot;Lives&quot;) of post-Roman saints, none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources (the earliest probably dates from the 11th century). According to the &quot;Life of Saint Gildas&quot;, written in the early 12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan, Arthur is said to have killed Gildas&#x27;s brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury. In the &quot;Life of Saint Cadoc&quot;, written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan, the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur&#x27;s soldiers, and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as &quot;wergeld&quot; for his men. Cadoc delivers them as demanded, but when Arthur takes possession of the animals, they turn into bundles of ferns. Similar incidents are described in the medieval biographies of Carannog, Padarn, and Eufflam, probably written around the 12th century. A less legendary account of Arthur appears in the &quot;Legenda Sancti Goeznovii&quot;, which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century (although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century and the text is now dated to the late 12th to early 13th century). Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;De Gestis Regum Anglorum&quot; and Herman&#x27;s &quot;De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudunensis&quot;, which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return, a theme that is often revisited in post-Galfridian folklore.

=== Geoffrey of Monmouth ===
Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, completed , contains the first narrative account of Arthur&#x27;s life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;. According to Geoffrey&#x27;s tale, Arthur was a descendant of Constantine the Great. He incorporates Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur&#x27;s conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin&#x27;s magic, sleeps with Gorlois&#x27;s wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther&#x27;s death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur&#x27;s victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again.

How much of this narrative was Geoffrey&#x27;s own invention is open to debate. He seems to have made use of the list of Arthur&#x27;s twelve battles against the Saxons found in the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, along with the battle of Camlann from the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; and the idea that Arthur was still alive. Arthur&#x27;s status as the king of all Britain seems to be borrowed from pre-Galfridian tradition, being found in &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, the Welsh Triads, and the saints&#x27; lives. Finally, Geoffrey borrowed many of the names for Arthur&#x27;s possessions, close family, and companions from the pre-Galfridian Welsh tradition, including Kaius (Cei), Beduerus (Bedwyr), Guenhuuara (Gwenhwyfar), Uther (Uthyr) and perhaps also Caliburnus (Caledfwlch), the latter becoming Excalibur in subsequent Arthurian tales. However, while names, key events, and titles may have been borrowed, Brynley Roberts has argued that &quot;the Arthurian section is Geoffrey&#x27;s literary creation and it owes nothing to prior narrative.&quot; Geoffrey makes the Welsh Medraut into the villainous Modredus, but there is no trace of such a negative character for this figure in Welsh sources until the 16th century. There have been relatively few modern attempts to challenge the notion that the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; is primarily Geoffrey&#x27;s own work, with scholarly opinion often echoing William of Newburgh&#x27;s late-12th-century comment that Geoffrey &quot;made up&quot; his narrative, perhaps through an &quot;inordinate love of lying&quot;. Geoffrey Ashe is one dissenter from this view, believing that Geoffrey&#x27;s narrative is partially derived from a lost source telling of the deeds of a 5th-century British king named Riotamus, this figure being the original Arthur, although historians and Celticists have been reluctant to follow Ashe in his conclusions.

Whatever his sources may have been, the immense popularity of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; cannot be denied. Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey&#x27;s Latin work are known to have survived, as well as translations into other languages. For example, 60 manuscripts are extant containing the &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, Welsh-language versions of the &quot;Historia&quot;, the earliest of which were created in the 13th century. The old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th-century Lewis Morris, has long since been discounted in academic circles. As a result of this popularity, Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend. While it was not the only creative force behind Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed (e.g., Merlin and the final fate of Arthur), and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers&#x27; tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted.

=== Romance traditions ===
The Welsh prose tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; (latter half of the 12th century), included in the modern &quot;Mabinogion&quot; collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur&#x27;s men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur&#x27;s court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; sometimes substituted for &quot;The Island of Britain&quot; in the formula &quot;Three XXX of the Island of Britain&quot;. While it is not clear from the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; and the Triads were written he had become &quot;Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon&quot;, &quot;Chief of the Lords of this Island&quot;, the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.

During the ongoing conquest of Wales by Edward I, he attempted to make King Arthur a fundamentally English character and hero. The completion of the conquest was one of the factors that shifted storytellers away from the Welsh roots of the original tales.

The popularity of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; and its other derivative works (such as Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;) gave rise to a significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France. It was not, however, the only Arthurian influence on the developing &quot;Matter of Britain&quot;. There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey&#x27;s work became widely known (see for example, the Modena Archivolt), and &quot;Celtic&quot; names and stories not found in Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; appear in the Arthurian romances. From the perspective of Arthur, perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself: much of this 12th-century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere, Percival, Galahad, Gawain, Ywain, and Tristan and Iseult. Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre-Galfridian material and Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; itself, in the romances he is rapidly sidelined. His character also alters significantly. In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior, who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns, whereas in the continental romances he becomes the &quot;roi fainéant&quot;, the &quot;do-nothing king&quot;, whose &quot;inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society&quot;. Arthur&#x27;s role in these works is frequently that of a wise, dignified, even-tempered, somewhat bland, and occasionally feeble monarch. So, he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot&#x27;s affair with Guinevere in the &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, whilst in &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap. Nonetheless, as Norris J. Lacy has observed, whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances, &quot;his prestige is never—or almost never—compromised by his personal weaknesses ... his authority and glory remain intact.&quot;

Arthur and his retinue appear in some of the &quot;Lais&quot; of Marie de France, but it was the work of another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, that had the greatest influence with regard to the development of Arthur&#x27;s character and legend. Chrétien wrote five Arthurian romances between and 1190. &quot;Erec and Enide&quot; and &quot;Cligès&quot; are tales of courtly love with Arthur&#x27;s court as their backdrop, demonstrating the shift away from the heroic world of the Welsh and Galfridian Arthur, while &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, features Yvain and Gawain in a supernatural adventure, with Arthur very much on the sidelines and weakened. However, the most significant for the development of the Arthurian legend are &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;, which introduces Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with Arthur&#x27;s queen Guinevere, extending and popularising the recurring theme of Arthur as a cuckold, and &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, which introduces the Holy Grail and the Fisher King and which again sees Arthur having a much reduced role. Chrétien was thus &quot;instrumental both in the elaboration of the Arthurian legend and in the establishment of the ideal form for the diffusion of that legend&quot;, and much of what came after him in terms of the portrayal of Arthur and his world built upon the foundations he had laid. &quot;Perceval&quot;, although unfinished, was particularly popular: four separate continuations of the poem appeared over the next half century, with the notion of the Grail and its quest being developed by other writers such as Robert de Boron, a fact that helped accelerate the decline of Arthur in continental romance. Similarly, Lancelot and his cuckolding of Arthur with Guinevere became one of the classic motifs of the Arthurian legend, although the Lancelot of the prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; () and later texts was a combination of Chrétien&#x27;s character and that of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven&#x27;s &quot;Lanzelet&quot;. Chrétien&#x27;s work even appears to feed back into Welsh Arthurian literature, with the result that the romance Arthur began to replace the heroic, active Arthur in Welsh literary tradition. Particularly significant in this development were the three Welsh Arthurian romances, which are closely similar to those of Chrétien, albeit with some significant differences: &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot; is related to Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Yvain&quot;; &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;, to &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;; and &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;, to &quot;Perceval&quot;.

Up to , continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the &quot;Estoire del Saint Grail&quot;, the &quot;Estoire de Merlin&quot;, the &quot;Lancelot propre&quot; (or Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot; and the &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause, and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Lancelot&quot;, as Arthur&#x27;s primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (), of which the &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot; is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot&#x27;s affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the &quot;Estoire de Merlin&quot; and the &quot;Mort Artu&quot;. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon&#x27;s &quot;Voeux du Paon&quot; in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.

The development of the medieval Arthurian cycle and the character of the &quot;Arthur of romance&quot; culminated in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Thomas Malory&#x27;s retelling of the entire legend in a single work in English in the late 15th century. Malory based his book—originally titled &quot;The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table&quot;—on the various previous romance versions, in particular the Vulgate Cycle, and appears to have aimed at creating a comprehensive and authoritative collection of Arthurian stories. Perhaps as a result of this, and the fact that &quot;Le Morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot; was one of the earliest printed books in England, published by William Caxton in 1485, most later Arthurian works are derivative of Malory&#x27;s.

== Decline, revival, and the modern legend ==

=== Post-medieval literature ===
The end of the Middle Ages brought with it a waning of interest in King Arthur. Although Malory&#x27;s English version of the great French romances was popular, there were increasing attacks upon the truthfulness of the historical framework of the Arthurian romances – established since Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s time – and thus the legitimacy of the whole Matter of Britain. So, for example, the 16th-century humanist scholar Polydore Vergil famously rejected the claim that Arthur was the ruler of a post-Roman empire, found throughout the post-Galfridian medieval &quot;chronicle tradition&quot;, to the horror of Welsh and English antiquarians. Social changes associated with the end of the medieval period and the Renaissance also conspired to rob the character of Arthur and his associated legend of some of their power to enthrall audiences, with the result that 1634 saw the last printing of Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; for nearly 200 years. King Arthur and the Arthurian legend were not entirely abandoned, but until the early 19th century the material was taken less seriously and was often used simply as a vehicle for allegories of 17th- and 18th-century politics. Thus Richard Blackmore&#x27;s epics &quot;Prince Arthur&quot; (1695) and &quot;King Arthur&quot; (1697) feature Arthur as an allegory for the struggles of William III against James II. Similarly, the most popular Arthurian tale throughout this period seems to have been that of Tom Thumb, which was told first through chapbooks and later through the political plays of Henry Fielding; although the action is clearly set in Arthurian Britain, the treatment is humorous and Arthur appears as a primarily comedic version of his romance character. John Dryden&#x27;s masque &quot;King Arthur&quot; is still performed, largely thanks to Henry Purcell&#x27;s music, though seldom unabridged.

=== Tennyson and the revival ===
In the early 19th century, medievalism, Romanticism, and the Gothic Revival reawakened interest in Arthur and the medieval romances. A new code of ethics for 19th-century gentlemen was shaped around the chivalric ideals embodied in the &quot;Arthur of romance&quot;. This renewed interest first made itself felt in 1816, when Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; was reprinted for the first time since 1634. Initially, the medieval Arthurian legends were of particular interest to poets, inspiring, for example, William Wordsworth to write &quot;The Egyptian Maid&quot; (1835), an allegory of the Holy Grail. Pre-eminent among these was Alfred Tennyson, whose first Arthurian poem &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; was published in 1832. Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these works, following in the medieval romance tradition. Tennyson&#x27;s Arthurian work reached its peak of popularity with &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, however, which reworked the entire narrative of Arthur&#x27;s life for the Victorian era. It was first published in 1859 and sold 10,000 copies within the first week. In the &quot;Idylls&quot;, Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood who ultimately failed, through human weakness, to establish a perfect kingdom on earth. Tennyson&#x27;s works prompted a large number of imitators, generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself, and brought Malory&#x27;s tales to a wider audience. Indeed, the first modernisation of Malory&#x27;s great compilation of Arthur&#x27;s tales was published in 1862, shortly after &quot;Idylls&quot; appeared, and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended.

This interest in the &quot;Arthur of romance&quot; and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th, and influenced poets such as William Morris and Pre-Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne-Jones. Even the humorous tale of Tom Thumb, which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur&#x27;s legend in the 18th century, was rewritten after the publication of &quot;Idylls&quot;. While Tom maintained his small stature and remained a figure of comic relief, his story now included more elements from the medieval Arthurian romances and Arthur is treated more seriously and historically in these new versions. The revived Arthurian romance also proved influential in the United States, with such books as Sidney Lanier&#x27;s &quot;The Boy&#x27;s King Arthur&quot; (1880) reaching wide audiences and providing inspiration for Mark Twain&#x27;s satire &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1889). Although the &#x27;Arthur of romance&#x27; was sometimes central to these new Arthurian works (as he was in Burne-Jones&#x27;s &quot;The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon&quot;, 1881–1898), on other occasions he reverted to his medieval status and is either marginalised or even missing entirely, with Wagner&#x27;s Arthurian opera Parsifal providing a notable instance of the latter. Furthermore, the revival of interest in Arthur and the Arthurian tales did not continue unabated. By the end of the 19th century, it was confined mainly to Pre-Raphaelite imitators, and it could not avoid being affected by World War I, which damaged the reputation of chivalry and thus interest in its medieval manifestations and Arthur as chivalric role model. The romance tradition did, however, remain sufficiently powerful to persuade Thomas Hardy, Laurence Binyon and John Masefield to compose Arthurian plays, and T. S. Eliot alludes to the Arthur myth (but not Arthur) in his poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, which mentions the Fisher King.

=== Modern legend ===

In the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; (1958), Mary Stewart&#x27;s &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; (1970) and its four sequels, Thomas Berger&#x27;s tragicomic &quot;Arthur Rex&quot; and Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; (1982), in addition to comic strips such as &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (from 1937 onward). Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Mary Stewart&#x27;s first three Arthurian novels present the wizard Merlin as the central character, rather than Arthur, and &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; is narrated by Merlin in the first person, whereas Bradley&#x27;s tale takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials. American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. In John Cowper Powys&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1951), set in Wales in 499, just prior to the Saxon invasion, Arthur, the Emperor of Britain, is only a minor character, whereas Myrddin (Merlin) and Nineue, Tennyson&#x27;s Vivien, are major figures. Myrddin&#x27;s disappearance at the end of the novel is, &quot;in the tradition of magical hibernation when the king or mage leaves his people for some island or cave to return either at a more propitious or more dangerous time&quot;, (see King Arthur&#x27;s messianic return). Powys&#x27;s earlier novel, &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; (1932) is concerned with both the Holy Grail and the legend that Arthur is buried at Glastonbury.

The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White&#x27;s novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960) and Walt Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963); &quot;Camelot&quot;, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and in critically respected films like Robert Bresson&#x27;s &quot;Lancelot du Lac&quot; (1974), Éric Rohmer&#x27;s &quot;Perceval le Gallois&quot; (1978) and John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975).

Retellings and reimaginings of the romance tradition are not the only important aspect of the modern legend of King Arthur. Attempts to portray Arthur as a genuine historical figure of , stripping away the &quot;romance&quot;, have also emerged. As Taylor and Brewer have noted, this return to the medieval &quot;chronicle tradition&quot; of Geoffrey of Monmouth and the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; is a recent trend which became dominant in Arthurian literature in the years following the outbreak of the Second World War, when Arthur&#x27;s legendary resistance to Germanic enemies struck a chord in Britain. Clemence Dane&#x27;s series of radio plays, &quot;The Saviours&quot; (1942), used a historical Arthur to embody the spirit of heroic resistance against desperate odds, and Robert Sherriff&#x27;s play &quot;The Long Sunset&quot; (1955) saw Arthur rallying Romano-British resistance against the Germanic invaders. This trend towards placing Arthur in a historical setting is also apparent in historical and fantasy novels published during this period. 

Arthur has also been used as a model for modern-day behaviour. In the 1930s, the Order of the Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table was formed in Britain to promote Christian ideals and Arthurian notions of medieval chivalry. In the United States, hundreds of thousands of boys and girls joined Arthurian youth groups, such as the Knights of King Arthur, in which Arthur and his legends were promoted as wholesome exemplars. However, Arthur&#x27;s diffusion within modern culture goes beyond such Arthurian endeavours, with Arthurian names being regularly attached to objects, buildings, and places. As Norris J. Lacy has observed, &quot;The popular notion of Arthur appears to be limited, not surprisingly, to a few motifs and names, but there can be no doubt of the extent to which a legend born many centuries ago is profoundly embedded in modern culture at every level.&quot;

<text>Konrad Ernst Otto Zuse (; ; 22 June 1910 – 18 December 1995) was a German civil engineer, pioneering computer scientist, inventor and businessman. His greatest achievement was the world&#x27;s first programmable computer; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941. Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse is regarded by some as the inventor and father of the modern computer.

Zuse was noted for the S2 computing machine, considered the first process control computer. In 1941, he founded one of the earliest computer businesses, producing the Z4, which became the world&#x27;s first commercial computer. From 1943 to 1945 he designed Plankalkül, the first high-level programming language. In 1969, Zuse suggested the concept of a computation-based universe in his book (&quot;Calculating Space&quot;).

Much of his early work was financed by his family and commerce, but after 1939 he was given resources by the government of Nazi Germany. Due to World War II, Zuse&#x27;s work went largely unnoticed in the United Kingdom and United States. Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was IBM&#x27;s option on his patents in 1946. The Z4 also served as the inspiration for the construction of the ERMETH, the first Swiss computer and one of the first in Europe.

==Early life and education==
Konrad Zuse was born in Berlin on 22 June 1910. In 1912, his family moved to East Prussian Braunsberg (now Braniewo in Poland), where his father was a postal clerk. Zuse attended the Collegium Hosianum in Braunsberg, and in 1923, the family moved to Hoyerswerda, where he passed his Abitur in 1928, qualifying him to enter university.

He enrolled at Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technische Universität Berlin) and explored both engineering and architecture, but found them boring. Zuse then pursued civil engineering, graduating in 1935.

==Career== 
After graduation, Zuse worked for the Ford Motor Company, using his artistic skills in the design of advertisements. He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, leading him to theorize and plan a way of doing them by machine.

Beginning in 1935, he experimented in the construction of computers in his parents&#x27; flat on 38, moving with them into their new flat on 10, the street leading up the Kreuzberg, Berlin. Working in his parents&#x27; apartment in 1936, he produced his first attempt, the Z1, a floating-point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from a perforated 35 mm film. 
In 1937, Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a von Neumann architecture. In 1938, he finished the Z1 which contained some 30,000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision. On 30 January 1944, the Z1 and its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents&#x27; flat and many neighbouring buildings by a British air raid in World War II.

Zuse completed his work entirely independently of other leading computer scientists and mathematicians of his day. Between 1936 and 1945, he was in near-total intellectual isolation.

===1939–1945===
In 1939, Zuse was called to military service, where he was given the resources to ultimately build the Z2. In September 1940 Zuse presented the Z2, covering several rooms in the parental flat, to experts of the (DVL; German Research Institute for Aviation). The Z2 was a revised version of the Z1 using telephone relays.

In 1940, the German government began funding him and his company through the (AVA, Aerodynamic Research Institute, forerunner of the DLR), which used his work for the production of glide bombs. Zuse built the S1 and S2 computing machines, which were special purpose devices which computed aerodynamic corrections to the wings of radio-controlled flying bombs. The S2 featured an integrated analog-to-digital converter under program control, making it the first process-controlled computer.

In 1941 Zuse started a company, (Zuse Apparatus Construction), to manufacture his machines, renting a workshop on the opposite side in 7 and stretching through the block to 29 (renamed and renumbered as Mehringdamm 84 in 1947).

In 1941, he improved on the basic Z2 machine, and built the Z3. On 12 May 1941 Zuse presented the Z3, built in his workshop, to the public. The Z3 was a binary 22-bit floating-point calculator featuring programmability with loops but without conditional jumps, with memory and a calculation unit based on telephone relays. The telephone relays used in his machines were largely collected from discarded stock. Despite the absence of conditional jumps, the Z3 was a Turing complete computer. However, Turing-completeness was never considered by Zuse (who was unaware of Turing&#x27;s work and had practical applications in mind) and only demonstrated in 1998 (see History of computing hardware).

The Z3, the first fully operational electromechanical computer, was partially financed by German government-supported DVL, which wanted their extensive calculations automated. A request by his co-worker Helmut Schreyer—who had helped Zuse build the Z3 prototype in 1938—for government funding for an electronic successor to the Z3 was denied as &quot;strategically unimportant&quot;.
In 1937, Schreyer had advised Zuse to use vacuum tubes as switching elements; Zuse at this time considered it a &quot;crazy idea&quot; ( in his own words). Zuse&#x27;s workshop on 7 (along with the Z3) was destroyed in an Allied Air raid in late 1943 and the parental flat with Z1 and Z2 on 30 January the following year, whereas the successor Z4, which Zuse had begun constructing in 1942 in new premises in the on 6, remained intact.

On 3 February 1945, aerial bombing caused devastating destruction in the Luisenstadt, the area around , including neighbouring houses. This event effectively brought Zuse&#x27;s research and development to a complete halt. The partially finished, telephone relay-based Z4 computer was then packed and moved from Berlin on 14 February, arriving in Göttingen approximately two weeks later.

These machines contributed to the Henschel Werke Hs 293 and Hs 294 guided missiles developed by the German military between 1941 and 1945, which were the precursors to the modern cruise missile. The circuit design of the S1 was the predecessor of Zuse&#x27;s Z11. Zuse believed that these machines had been captured by occupying Soviet troops in 1945.

While working on his Z4 computer, Zuse realised that programming in machine code was too complicated. He started working on a PhD thesis, containing groundbreaking research years ahead of its time, mainly the first high-level programming language, (&quot;Plan Calculus&quot;) and, as an elaborate example program, the first real computer chess engine.

===1945–1995===
After the 1945 Luisenstadt bombing, he fled from Berlin to the rural Allgäu. In the extreme deprivation of post-war Germany Zuse was unable to build computers.

Zuse founded one of the earliest computer companies: the . Capital was raised in 1946 through ETH Zurich and an IBM option on Zuse&#x27;s patents.

In 1947, according to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse in Göttingen. The encounter had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, ).
It was not until 1949 that Zuse was able to resume work on the Z4. He would show the computer to the mathematician Eduard Stiefel of the ETH Zurich. The two men settled a deal to lend the Z4 to the ETH.
In November 1949, Zuse founded another company, Zuse KG, in Haunetal-Neukirchen; in 1957, the company&#x27;s head office moved to Bad Hersfeld. The Z4 was finished and delivered to the ETH Zurich in July 1950, where it proved very reliable. At that time, it was the only working digital computer in Central Europe, and the second computer in the world to be sold or loaned, beaten only by the BINAC, which never worked properly after it was delivered. Other computers, all numbered with a leading Z, up to Z43, were built by Zuse and his company. Notable are the Z11, which was sold to the optics industry and to universities, and the Z22, the first computer with a memory based on magnetic storage.

Unable to do any hardware development, he continued working on , eventually publishing some brief excerpts of his thesis in 1948 and 1959; the work in its entirety, however, remained unpublished until 1972. The PhD thesis was submitted at University of Augsburg, but it was rejected because Zuse forgot to pay the DM 400 university enrollment fee. The rejection did not bother him. 

 slightly influenced the design of ALGOL 58 but was itself implemented only in 1975 in a dissertation by Joachim Hohmann. Heinz Rutishauser, one of the inventors of ALGOL, wrote: &quot;The very first attempt to devise an algorithmic language was undertaken in 1948 by K. Zuse. His notation was quite general, but the proposal never attained the consideration it deserved.&quot; Further implementations followed in 1998 and then in 2000 by a team from the Free University of Berlin. Donald Knuth suggested a thought experiment: What might have happened had the bombing not taken place, and had the PhD thesis accordingly been published as planned?
In 1956, Zuse began to work on a high precision, large format plotter. It was demonstrated at the 1961 Hanover Fair, and became well known also outside of the technical world thanks to Frieder Nake&#x27;s pioneering computer art work. Other plotters designed by Zuse include the ZUSE Z90 and ZUSE Z9004.
In 1967, Zuse suggested that the universe itself is running on a cellular automaton or similar computational structure (digital physics); in 1969, he published the book (translated into English as &quot;Calculating Space&quot;).

Between 1989 and 1995, Zuse conceptualized and created a purely mechanical, extensible, modular tower automaton he named &quot;helix tower&quot; (). The structure is based on a gear drive that employs rotary motion (e.g. provided by a crank) to assemble modular components from a storage space, elevating a tube-shaped tower; the process is reversible, and inverting the input direction will deconstruct the tower and store the components. In 2009, the restored Zuse&#x27;s original 1:30 functional model that can be extended to a height of 2.7 m. Zuse intended the full construction to reach a height of 120 m, and envisioned it for use with wind power generators and radio transmission installations.

Between 1987 and 1989, Zuse recreated the Z1, suffering a heart attack midway through the project. It cost 800,000 DM (approximately $500,000) and required four individuals (including Zuse) to assemble it. Funding for this retrocomputing project was provided by Siemens and a consortium of five companies.

==Personal life==

Konrad Zuse married Gisela Brandes in January 1945, employing a carriage, himself dressed in tailcoat and top hat and with Gisela in a wedding veil, for Zuse attached importance to a &quot;noble ceremony&quot;. Their son Horst, the first of five children, was born in November 1945.

While Zuse never became a member of the Nazi Party, he is not known to have expressed any doubts or qualms about working for the Nazi war effort. Much later, he suggested that in modern times, the best scientists and engineers usually have to choose between either doing their work for more or less questionable business and military interests in a Faustian bargain, or not pursuing their line of work at all.

After Zuse retired, he focused on his hobby of painting. He signed his paintings as &quot;Kuno [von und zu] See&quot;.

Zuse was an atheist.

Zuse died on 18 December 1995 in Hünfeld, Hesse (near Fulda) from heart failure.

==Awards and honours==

Zuse received several awards for his work:
* &quot;Werner von Siemens Ring&quot; in 1964 (together with Fritz Leonhardt and Walter Schottky)
* &quot;Harry H. Goode Memorial Award&quot; in 1965 (together with George Stibitz)
* Wilhelm Exner Medal in 1969.
* &quot;Bundesverdienstkreuz&quot; in 1972 – &quot;Great Cross of Merit&quot;
* &quot;Computer History Museum Fellow Award&quot; in 1999 &quot;for his invention of the first program-controlled, electromechanical, digital computer and the first high-level programming language, Plankalkül.&quot;

The Zuse Institute Berlin is named in his honour.

The Konrad Zuse Medal of the Gesellschaft für Informatik, and the Konrad Zuse Medal of the Zentralverband des Deutschen Baugewerbes (Central Association of German Construction), are both named after Zuse.

A replica of the Z3, as well as the original Z4, is in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. The in Berlin has an exhibition devoted to Zuse, displaying twelve of his machines, including a replica of the Z1 and several of Zuse&#x27;s paintings.

The 100th anniversary of his birth was celebrated by exhibitions, lectures and workshops.

<text>Kenesaw Mountain Landis (; November 20, 1866 – November 25, 1944) was an American jurist who served as a United States federal judge from 1905 to 1922 and the first commissioner of baseball from 1920 until his death. He is remembered for his resolution of the Black Sox Scandal, in which he expelled eight members of the Chicago White Sox from organized baseball for conspiring to lose the 1919 World Series and repeatedly refused their reinstatement requests. His iron rule over baseball in the near quarter-century of his commissionership is generally credited with restoring public confidence in the game.

Landis was born in Millville, Ohio. Raised in Indiana, he became a lawyer, and then personal secretary to Walter Q. Gresham, the new United States secretary of state, in 1893. He returned to private practice after Gresham died in office.

President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Landis to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in 1905. Landis received national attention in 1907 when he fined Standard Oil of Indiana more than $29 million (approximately $800 million in 2021) for violating federal laws forbidding rebates on railroad freight tariffs. While Landis&#x27;s action was reversed on appeal, he was seen as a judge determined to rein in big business. During and after World War I, Landis presided over several high-profile trials of draft resisters and others whom he saw as opposing the war effort. He imposed heavy sentences on those who were convicted, although some of the convictions were reversed on appeal, and other sentences were commuted.

In 1920, Landis was a leading candidate when American League and National League team owners, embarrassed by the Black Sox scandal and other instances of players throwing games, sought someone to rule over baseball. Landis was given full power to act in the sport&#x27;s best interest, and used that power extensively over the next quarter century. Landis was widely praised for cleaning up the game, although some of his decisions in the Black Sox matter remain controversial: supporters of &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; Jackson and Buck Weaver contend that he was overly harsh. Others blame Landis for, in their view, delaying the racial integration of baseball. Landis was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by a special vote shortly after he died in 1944.

== Early life and pre-judicial career (1866–1905) ==

=== Boyhood and early career (1866–1893) ===

Kenesaw Mountain Landis was born in Millville, Ohio, on November 20, 1866, the sixth child and fourth son of Abraham Hoch Landis, a physician, and Mary Kumler Landis. The Landises descended from Swiss Mennonites. Abraham Landis had been wounded fighting in the U.S. Army at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia, and when the new baby&#x27;s parents proved unable to agree on a name, Mary Landis proposed that they call him Kenesaw Mountain. (At the time, both spellings of &quot;Kenesaw&quot; were used, but later &quot;Kennesaw Mountain&quot; became the accepted spelling of the battle site.)

Abraham Landis worked in Millville as a country physician. When Kenesaw was eight, the elder Landis moved his family to Delphi, Indiana, and subsequently to Logansport, Indiana, where he purchased and ran several local farms—his war injury had caused him to scale back his medical practice. Two of Kenesaw&#x27;s four brothers, Charles Beary Landis and Frederick Landis, became members of Congress.

As &quot;Kenny&quot;, as he was sometimes known, grew, he did an increasing share of the farm work, later stating, &quot;I did my share—and it was a substantial share—in taking care of the 13 acres ... I do not remember that I particularly liked to get up at 3:30 in the morning.&quot; Kenesaw began his off-farm career at age ten as a news delivery boy. He left school at 15 after an unsuccessful attempt to master algebra. He worked at the local general store and then as errand boy with the Vandalia Railroad. Landis applied for a job as a brakeman, but was laughingly dismissed as too small. He then worked for the Logansport &quot;Journal&quot;, and taught himself shorthand reporting, becoming in 1883 official court reporter for the Cass County Circuit Court. Landis later wrote, &quot;I may not have been much of a judge, nor baseball official, but I do pride myself on having been a real shorthand reporter.&quot; He served in that capacity until 1886. In his spare time, he became a prize-winning bicycle racer and played on and managed a baseball team. Offered a professional contract as a ballplayer, he turned it down, stating that he preferred to play for the love of the game.

In 1886, Landis first ventured into Republican Party politics, supporting a friend, Charles F. Griffin, for Indiana secretary of state. Griffin won, and Landis was rewarded with a civil service job in the Indiana Department of State. While employed there, he applied to be an attorney. At that time, in Indiana, an applicant needed only to prove that he was 21 and of good moral character, and Landis was admitted. Landis opened a practice in Marion, Indiana, but attracted few clients in his year of work there. Realizing that an uneducated lawyer was unlikely to build a lucrative practice, Landis enrolled at Cincinnati&#x27;s YMCA Law School (now part of Northern Kentucky University) in 1889. Landis transferred to Union Law School (part of Northwestern University) the following year, and in 1891, he took his law degree from Union and was admitted to the Illinois Bar. He began a practice in Chicago, served as an assistant instructor at Union and with fellow attorney Clarence Darrow helped found the nonpartisan Chicago Civic Centre Club, devoted to municipal reform. Landis practiced with college friend Frank O. Lowden; the future commissioner and his law partner went into debt to impress potential clients, buying a law library secondhand.

=== Washington years and aftermath (1893–1905) ===

In March 1893, President Grover Cleveland appointed federal judge Walter Q. Gresham as his secretary of state, and Gresham hired Landis as his personal secretary. Gresham had a long career as a political appointee in the latter part of the 19th century; though he lost his only two bids for elective office, he served in three Cabinet positions and was twice a dark horse candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Although Gresham was a Republican, he had supported Cleveland (a Democrat) in the 1892 election because of his intense dislike for the Republican nominee, President Benjamin Harrison. Kenesaw Landis had appeared before Judge Gresham in court. According to Landis biographer J. G. Taylor Spink, Gresham thought Landis &quot;had something on the ball&quot; and believed that Landis&#x27;s shorthand skills would be of use.

In Washington, Landis worked hard to protect Gresham&#x27;s interests in the State Department, making friends with many members of the press. He was less popular among many of the Department&#x27;s senior career officials, who saw him as brash. When word leaked concerning President Cleveland&#x27;s Hawaiian policy, the President was convinced Landis was the source of the information and demanded his dismissal. Gresham defended Landis, stating that Cleveland would have to fire both of them, and the President relented, later finding out that he was mistaken in accusing Landis. President Cleveland grew to like Landis, and when Gresham died in 1895, offered Landis the post of United States ambassador to Venezuela. Landis declined the diplomatic post, preferring to return to Chicago to begin a law practice and to marry Winifred Reed, daughter of the Ottawa, Illinois, postmaster. The two married July 25, 1895; they had two surviving children, a boy, Reed, and a girl, Susanne—a third child, Winifred, died almost immediately after being born.

Landis built a corporate law practice in Chicago; with the practice doing well, he deeply involved himself in Republican Party politics. He built a close association with his friend Lowden and served as his campaign manager for governor of Illinois in 1904. Lowden was defeated, but would later serve two terms in the office and be a major contender for the 1920 Republican presidential nomination. A seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was vacant; President Theodore Roosevelt offered it to Lowden, who declined it and recommended Landis. Other recommendations from Illinois politicians followed, and Roosevelt nominated Landis for the seat. According to Spink, President Roosevelt wanted &quot;a tough judge and a man sympathetic with his viewpoint in that important court&quot;; Lowden and Landis were, like Roosevelt, on the progressive left of the Republican Party. On March 18, 1905, Roosevelt transmitted the nomination to the Senate, which confirmed Landis the same afternoon, without any committee hearing; he received his commission the same day.

== Judge (1905–1922) ==

Landis&#x27;s courtroom, room 627 in the Chicago Federal Building, was ornate and featured two murals: one of King John conceding Magna Carta, the other of Moses about to smash the tablets of the Ten Commandments. The mahogany and marble chamber was, according to Landis biographer David Pietrusza, &quot;just the spot for Landis&#x27;s sense of the theatrical. In it he would hold court for nearly the next decade and a half.&quot; According to Spink, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t long before Chicago writers discovered they had a &#x27;character&#x27; on the bench.&quot; A. L. Sloan of the Chicago &quot;Herald-American&quot;, a friend of Landis, recalled:
The Judge was always headline news. He was a great showman, theatrical in appearance, with his sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and people always crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something going on. There were few dull moments.
If Judge Landis was suspicious of an attorney&#x27;s line of questioning, he would wrinkle his nose, and once told a witness, &quot;Now let&#x27;s stop fooling around and tell exactly what did happen, without reciting your life&#x27;s history.&quot; When an elderly defendant told him that he would not be able to live to complete a five-year sentence, Landis scowled at him and asked, &quot;Well, you can try, can&#x27;t you?&quot; When a young man stood before him for sentencing after admitting to stealing jewels from a parcel, the defendant&#x27;s wife stood near him, infant daughter in her arms, and Landis mused what to do about the situation. After a dramatic pause, Landis ordered the young man to take his wife and daughter and go home with them, expressing his unwillingness to have the girl be the daughter of a convict. According to sportswriter Ed Fitzgerald in &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine, &quot;[w]omen wept unashamed and the entire courtroom burst into spontaneous, prolonged applause.&quot;

Landis had been a lawyer with a corporate practice; upon his elevation to the bench, corporate litigants expected him to favor them. According to a 1907 magazine article about Landis, &quot;Corporations smiled pleasantly at the thought of a corporation lawyer being on the bench. They smile no more.&quot; In an early case, Landis fined the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company the maximum $4,000 for illegally importing workers, even though his wife&#x27;s brother-in-law served on the corporate board. In another decision, Landis struck down a challenge to the Interstate Commerce Commission&#x27;s (ICC) jurisdiction over rebating, a practice banned by the Elkins Act of 1903 in which railroads and favored customers agreed that the customers would pay less than the posted tariff, which by law was to be the same for all shippers. Landis&#x27;s decision allowed the ICC to take action against railroads which gave rebates.

=== Standard Oil (1905–1909) ===

By the first decade of the 20th century, a number of business entities had formed trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–1909) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day ExxonMobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.

In March 1906, Commissioner of Corporations James Rudolph Garfield submitted a report to President Roosevelt, alleging large-scale rebating in Standard Oil shipments. Federal prosecutors in several states and territories sought indictments against components of the Standard Oil Trust. On June 28, 1906, Standard Oil of Indiana was indicted on 6,428 counts of violation of the Elkins Act for accepting rebates on shipments on the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad. The case was assigned to Landis.

Trial on the 1,903 counts that survived pretrial motions began on March 4, 1907. The fact that rebates had been given was not contested; what was at issue was whether Standard Oil knew the railroad&#x27;s posted rates, and if it had a duty to enquire if it did not. Landis charged the jury that it &quot;was the duty of the defendant diligently in good faith to get from the Chicago &amp; Alton ... the lawful rate&quot;. The jury found Standard Oil guilty on all 1,903 counts.

The maximum fine that Landis could impose was $29,240,000. To aid the judge in determining the sentence, Landis issued a subpoena for Rockefeller to testify as to Standard Oil&#x27;s assets. The tycoon had often evaded subpoenas, not having testified in court since 1888. Deputy United States Marshals visited Rockefeller&#x27;s several homes, as well as the estates of his friends, in the hope of finding him. After several days, Rockefeller was found at his lawyer&#x27;s estate in northwestern Massachusetts and was served with the subpoena. The tycoon duly came to Landis&#x27;s Chicago courtroom, making his way through a mob anxious to see the proceedings. Rockefeller&#x27;s actual testimony, proffered after the judge made him wait through several cases and witnesses, proved to be anticlimactic, as he professed almost no knowledge of Standard Oil&#x27;s corporate structure or assets.

On August 3, 1907, Landis pronounced sentence. He fined Standard Oil the maximum penalty, $29,240,000, the largest fine imposed on a corporation to that date. The corporation quickly appealed; in the meantime, Landis was lionized as a hero. According to Pietrusza, &quot;much of the nation could hardly believe a federal judge had finally cracked down on a trust—and cracked down &quot;hard&quot; &quot;. President Roosevelt, when he heard the sentence, reportedly stated, &quot;That&#x27;s bully.&quot; Rockefeller was playing golf in Cleveland when he was brought a telegram containing the news. Rockefeller calmly informed his golfing partners of the amount, and proceeded to shoot a personal record score, later stating, &quot;Judge Landis will be dead a long time before this fine is paid.&quot; He proved correct; the verdict and sentence were reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on July 22, 1908. In January 1909, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, and in a new trial before another judge (Landis recused himself), Standard Oil was acquitted.

=== Federal League and Baby Iraene cases (1909–1917) ===

A lifelong baseball fan, Landis often slipped away from the courthouse for a White Sox or Cubs game. In 1914, the two existing major leagues were challenged by a new league, the Federal League. In 1915, the upstart league brought suit against the existing leagues and owners under the Sherman Act and the case was assigned to Landis. Baseball owners feared that the reserve clause, which forced players to sign new contracts only with their former team, and the 10-day clause, which allowed teams (but not players) to terminate player contracts on ten days notice, would be struck down by Landis.

Landis held hearings in late January 1915, and newspapers expected a quick decision, certainly before spring training began in March. During the hearings, Landis admonished the parties, &quot;Both sides must understand that any blows at the thing called baseball would be regarded by this court as a blow to a national institution&quot;. When the National League&#x27;s chief counsel, future senator George Wharton Pepper referred to the activities of baseball players on the field as &quot;labor&quot;, Landis interrupted him: &quot;As a result of 30 years of observation, I am shocked because you call playing baseball &#x27;labor.&#x27; &quot; Landis reserved judgment, and the parties waited for his ruling. Spring training passed, as did the entire regular season and the World Series. In December 1915, still with no word from Landis, the parties reached a settlement, and the Federal League disbanded. Landis made no public statement as to the reasons for his failure to rule, though he told close friends that he had been certain the parties would reach a settlement sooner or later. Most observers thought that Landis waited because he did not want to rule against the two established leagues and their contracts.

In 1916, Landis presided over the &quot;Ryan Baby&quot; or &quot;Baby Iraene&quot; case. The recent widow of a prominent Chicago banker, Anna Dollie Ledgerwood Matters, had brought a baby girl home from a visit to Canada and claimed that the child was her late husband&#x27;s posthumous heir. Matters had left an estate of $250,000. However, a shop girl from Ontario, Margaret Ryan, claimed the baby was hers, and brought a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in Landis&#x27;s court. Ryan stated that she had given birth to the girl in an Ottawa hospital, but had been told her baby had died. In the era before blood and DNA testing, Landis relied on witness testimony and awarded the child to Ryan. The case brought comparisons between Landis and King Solomon, who had judged a similar case. Landis was reversed by the Supreme Court, which held he had no jurisdiction in the matter. A Canadian court later awarded the child to Ryan.

Although Landis was an autocrat in the courtroom, he was less so at home. In a 1916 interview, he stated,
Every member of this family does exactly what he or she wants to do. Each one is his or her supreme court. Everything for the common good of the family is decided according to the wishes of the whole family. Each one knows what is right and each one can do whatever he thinks is best. It is purely democratic.
=== Wartime cases (1917–1919) ===

In early 1917, Landis considered leaving the bench and returning to private practice—though he greatly enjoyed being a judge, the salary of $7,500 was considerably lower than what he could make as an attorney. The entry of the United States into World War I in April ended Landis&#x27;s determination to resign; a firm supporter of the war effort, he felt he could best serve the country by remaining on the bench. Despite this decision and his age, fifty, Landis wrote to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, asking him to take him into the service and send him to France, where the war was raging. Baker urged Landis to make speeches in support of the war instead, which he did. The judge&#x27;s son, Reed, had already served briefly in the Illinois National Guard; during the war he became a pilot, and eventually an ace.

Landis&#x27;s disdain for draft dodgers and other opponents of the war was evident in July 1917, when he presided over the trials of some 120 men, mostly foreign-born Socialists, who had resisted the draft and rioted in Rockford, Illinois. According to Pietrusza, Landis &quot;was frequently brutal in his remarks&quot; to the defendants, interrogating them on their beliefs and actions. Landis tried the case in Rockford, and found all guilty, sentencing all but three to a year and a day in jail, the maximum sentence. The prisoners were ordered to register for the draft after serving their sentences—except 37, whom he ordered deported.

On September 5, 1917, federal officers raided the national headquarters, in Chicago, of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, sometimes &quot;Wobblies&quot;), as well as 48 of the union&#x27;s halls across the nation. The union had opposed the war and urged members and others to refuse conscription into the armed forces. On September 28, 166 IWW leaders, including union head Big Bill Haywood were indicted in the Northern District of Illinois; their cases were assigned to Landis. Some 40 of the indicted men could not be found; a few others had charges dismissed against them. Ultimately, Landis presided over a trial against 113 defendants, the largest federal criminal trial to that point.

The trial began on April 1, 1918. Landis quickly dismissed charges against a dozen defendants. Jury selection occupied a month. Communist journalist John Reed attended the trial, and wrote of his impressions of Landis:
Small on the huge bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an emaciated face in which two burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead ... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench to come down and perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners&#x27; seats ... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.
Haywood biographer Melvyn Dubofsky wrote that Landis &quot;exercised judicial objectivity and restraint for five long months&quot;. Baseball historian Harold Seymour stated that &quot;[o]n the whole, Landis conducted the trial with restraint, despite his reputation as a foe of all radical groups.&quot; Landis dismissed charges against an elderly defendant who was in obvious pain as he testified, and allowed the release of a number of prisoners on bail or on their own recognizances.

On August 17, 1918, following the closing argument for the prosecution (the defendants waived argument), Landis instructed the jury. The lead defense counsel objected to the wording of the jury charge several times, but Haywood believed it to have been fair. After 65 minutes, the jury returned with guilty verdicts for all of the remaining accused, much to their shock; they had believed that Landis&#x27;s charge pointed towards their acquittal. When the defendants returned to court on August 29, Landis listened with patience to the defendants&#x27; final pleas. For the sentencing, according to Richard Cahan in his history of Chicago&#x27;s district court, &quot;mild-mannered Landis returned a changed man&quot;. Although two defendants received only ten days in jail, all others received at least a year and a day, and Haywood and fourteen others received twenty years. A number of defendants, including Haywood, obtained bail during the appeal; even before Haywood&#x27;s appeals were exhausted, he jumped bail and took ship for the Soviet Union. The labor leader hung a portrait of Landis in his Moscow apartment, and when Haywood died in 1928, he was interred near John Reed (who had died of illness in Moscow after the Bolshevik Revolution) in the Kremlin Wall—they remain the only Americans so honored. President Calvin Coolidge commuted the sentences of the remaining incarcerated defendants in 1923, much to the disgust of Landis, who issued an angry statement. After leaving his judgeship, Landis referred to the defendants in the Haywood case as &quot;scum&quot;, &quot;filth&quot;, and &quot;slimy rats&quot;.

Landis hoped that the Kaiser, Wilhelm II would be captured and tried in his court; he wanted to indict the Kaiser for the murder of a Chicagoan who lost his life on the in 1915. The State Department notified Landis that extradition treaties did not permit the rendition of the Kaiser, who fled into exile in the Netherlands as the war concluded. Nevertheless, in a speech, Landis demanded that Kaiser Wilhelm, his six sons, and 5,000 German military leaders &quot;be lined up against a wall and shot down in justice to the world and to Germany&quot;.

Even with the armistice in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and had also been raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal &quot;to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language&quot; about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved for a change of venue away from Landis&#x27;s courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that &quot;[i]f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I would like to hear it so I could use it myself.&quot; Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion &quot;perjurious&quot;, and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, &quot;the country was then at war&quot;. At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal, but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, the charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.

=== Building trades award, controversy, and resignation (1920–1922) ===
The postwar period saw considerable deflation; the shortage of labor and materials during the war had led to much higher wages and prices, and in the postwar economic readjustment, wages were cut heavily. In Chicago, employers in the building trades attempted a 20% wage cut; when this was rejected by the unions, a lockout followed. Both sides agreed to submit the matter to a neutral arbitrator, and settled on Landis, who agreed to take the case in June 1921. By this time, Landis was Commissioner of Baseball, and still a federal judge. In September, Landis issued his report, cutting wages by an average of 12.5%. To improve productivity, he also struck restrictions on machinery which saved labor, established a standardized overtime rate, and resolved jurisdictional conflicts between unions. The labor organizations were not completely satisfied, but Landis&#x27;s reforms were adopted in many places across the country and were credited with reviving the building industry.

Criticism of Landis having both the judicial and baseball positions began almost as soon as his baseball appointment was announced in November 1920. On February 2, 1921, lame duck Congressman Benjamin F. Welty (Democrat-Ohio) offered a resolution calling for Landis&#x27;s impeachment. On February 11, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer opined that there was no legal impediment to Landis holding both jobs. On February 14, the House Judiciary Committee voted 24–1 to investigate Landis. Reed Landis later stated, &quot;[n]one of the other congressmen wanted Father impeached but they did want him to come down and defend himself because they knew what a show it would be.&quot;

Although Welty&#x27;s departure from office on March 4, 1921, began a lull in criticism of Landis, in April, the judge made a controversial decision in the case of Francis J. Carey, a 19-year-old bank teller, who had pleaded guilty to embezzling $96,500. Carey, the sole support of his widowed mother and unmarried sisters, gained Landis&#x27;s sympathy. He accused the bank of underpaying Carey, and sent the youth home with his mother. Two members of the Senate objected to Landis&#x27;s actions, and the &quot;New York Post&quot; compared Carey with &quot;Les Misérables&#x27;s&quot; Jean Valjean, noting &quot;[b]etween a loaf of bread [Valjean was incarcerated for stealing one] and $96,500 there is a difference.&quot; A bill barring outside employment by federal judges had been introduced by Landis&#x27;s foes, but had expired with the end of the congressional session in March; his opponents tried again in July, and the bill failed in the Senate on a tie vote. On September 1, 1921, the American Bar Association, a trade group of lawyers, passed a resolution of censure against Landis.

By the end of 1921, the controversy was dying down, and Landis felt that he could resign without looking pressured. On February 18, 1922, he announced his resignation as judge effective March 1, stating, &quot;There are not enough hours in the day for all these activities&quot;. In his final case, he fined two theatre owners for evading the federal amusement tax. One owner had refused to make restitution before sentencing; he was fined $5,000. The owner who had tried to make his shortfall good was fined one cent.

==== Black Sox scandal ====

By 1919, the influence of gamblers on baseball had been a problem for several years. Historian Paul Gardner wrote,
Baseball had for some time been living uneasily in the knowledge that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.


The 1919 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds was much anticipated, as the nation attempted to return to normalcy in the postwar period. Baseball had seen a surge of popularity during the 1919 season, which set several attendance records. The powerful White Sox, with their superstar batter &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; Jackson and star pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Claude &quot;Lefty&quot; Williams, were believed likely to defeat the less-well-regarded Reds. To the surprise of many, the Reds defeated the White Sox, five games to three (from 1919 to 1921, the World Series was a best-of-nine affair).

Rumors that the series was fixed began to circulate after gambling odds against the Reds winning dropped sharply before the series began, and gained more credibility after the White Sox lost four of the first five games. Cincinnati lost the next two games, and speculation began that the Reds were losing on purpose to extend the series and increase gate revenues. However, Cincinnati won Game Eight, 10–5, to end the series, as Williams lost his third game (Cicotte lost the other two). After the series, according to Gene Carney, who wrote a book about the scandal, &quot;there was more than the usual complaining from those who had bet big on the Sox and lost&quot;.

The issue of the 1919 Series came to the public eye again in September 1920, when, after allegations that a game between the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies on August 31 had been fixed, a grand jury was empaneled in state court in Chicago to investigate baseball gambling. Additional news came from Philadelphia, where gambler Billy Maharg stated that he had worked with former boxer Abe Attell and New York gambler Arnold Rothstein to get the White Sox to throw the 1919 Series. Cicotte and Jackson were called before the grand jury, where they gave statements incriminating themselves and six teammates: Williams, first baseman Chick Gandil, shortstop Swede Risberg, third baseman Buck Weaver, center fielder Happy Felsch and reserve infielder Fred McMullin. Williams and Felsch were also called before the grand jury and incriminated themselves and their teammates. Through late September, the 1920 American League season had been one of the most exciting on record, with the White Sox, Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees dueling for the league lead. By September 28, the Yankees were close to elimination, but the White Sox and Indians were within percentage points of each other. On that day, however, the eight players, seven of whom were still on the White Sox, were indicted. They were immediately suspended by White Sox owner Charles Comiskey. The Indians were able to pull ahead and win the pennant, taking the American League championship by two games over Chicago.

==== Search for a commissioner ====

Baseball had been governed by a three-man National Commission, consisting of American League President Ban Johnson, National League President John Heydler and Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann. In January 1920, Herrmann left office at the request of other club owners, leaving the Commission effectively deadlocked between Johnson and Heydler. A number of club owners, disliking one or both league presidents, preferred a single commissioner to rule over the game, but were willing to see the National Commission continue if Herrmann was replaced by someone who would provide strong leadership. Landis&#x27;s name was mentioned in the press for this role, and the influential baseball newspaper &quot;The Sporting News&quot; sought his appointment.

Another proposal, known as the &quot;Lasker Plan&quot; after Albert Lasker, a shareholder in the Chicago Cubs who had proposed it, was for a three-man commission to govern the game, drawn from outside baseball. On September 30, 1920, with the Black Sox scandal exposed, National League President Heydler began to advocate for the Lasker Plan, and by the following day, four major league teams had supported him. Among the names discussed in the press for membership on the new commission were Landis, former secretary of the treasury William Gibbs McAdoo, former president William Howard Taft, and General John J. Pershing.

The start of the 1920 World Series on October 5 distracted the public from baseball&#x27;s woes for a time, but discussions continued behind the scenes. By mid-October, 11 of the 16 team owners (all eight from the National League and the owners of the American League Yankees, White Sox and Boston Red Sox) were demanding the end of the National Commission and the appointment of a three-man commission whose members would have no financial interest in baseball. Heydler stated his views on baseball&#x27;s requirements:
We want a man as chairman who will rule with an iron hand ... Baseball has lacked a hand like that for years. It needs it now worse than ever. Therefore, it is our object to appoint a big man to lead the new commission.
On November 8, the owners of the eight National League and three American League teams which supported the Lasker Plan met and unanimously selected Landis as head of the proposed commission. The American League clubs that supported the plan threatened to move to the National League, away from Johnson, who opposed it. Johnson had hoped that the minor leagues would support his position; when they did not, he and the &quot;Loyal Five&quot; teams agreed to the Lasker Plan. In the discussions among the owners that followed, they decided that Landis would be the only commissioner–no associate members would be elected. On November 12, the team owners came to Landis&#x27;s courtroom to approach him. Landis was trying a bribery case; when he heard noise in the back of the courtroom from the owners, he gaveled them to silence. He made them wait 45 minutes while he completed his docket, then met with them in his chambers.

The judge heard out the owners; after expressing initial reluctance, he took the job for seven years at a salary of $50,000, on condition he could remain on the federal bench. During Landis&#x27;s time serving as both judge and commissioner, he allowed a $7,500 reduction in his commissioner salary, to reflect his pay as judge. The appointment of Landis was met with acclaim in the press. A tentative agreement was signed by the parties a month later—an agreement which itemized Landis&#x27;s powers over baseball, and which was drafted by the judge. The owners were still reeling from the perception that baseball was crooked, and accepted the agreement virtually without dissent. Under the terms of the contract, Landis could not be dismissed by the team owners, have his pay reduced, or even be criticized by them in public. He also had nearly unlimited authority over every person employed in the major or minor leagues, from owners to batboys, including the ability to ban people from the leagues for life. The owners waived any recourse to the courts to contest Landis&#x27;s will. Humorist Will Rogers stated, &quot;[D]on&#x27;t kid yourself that that old judicial bird isn&#x27;t going to make those baseball birds walk the chalkline&quot;. Player and manager Leo Durocher later stated, &quot;The legend has been spread that the owners hired the Judge off the federal bench. Don&#x27;t you believe it. They got him right out of Dickens.&quot;

=== Establishing control ===

==== Banning the Black Sox ====

On January 30, 1921, Landis, speaking at an Illinois church, warned:
Now that I am in baseball, just watch the game I play. If I catch any crook in baseball, the rest of his life is going to be a pretty hot one. I&#x27;ll go to any means and to anything possible to see that he gets a real penalty for his offense.
The criminal case against the Black Sox defendants suffered unexpected setbacks, with evidence vanishing, including some of the incriminating statements made to the grand jury. The prosecution was forced to dismiss the original indictments, and bring new charges against seven of the ballplayers (McMullin was not charged again). Frustrated by the delays, Landis placed all eight on an &quot;ineligible list&quot;, banning them from major and minor league baseball. Comiskey supported Landis by giving the seven who remained under contract to the White Sox their unconditional release. Public sentiment was heavily against the ballplayers, and when Jackson, Williams, Felsch, and Weaver played in a semi-pro game, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; mocked the 3,000 attendees, &quot;Just Like Nuts Go to See a Murderer&quot;.

The criminal trial of the Black Sox indictees began in early July 1921. Despite what Robert C. Cottrell, in his book on the scandal, terms &quot;the mysterious loss of evidence&quot;, the prosecution was determined to pursue the case, demanding five-year prison terms for the ballplayers for defrauding the public by throwing the series. On August 2, 1921, the jury returned not guilty verdicts against all defendants, leading to happy pandemonium in the courtroom, joined by the courtroom bailiffs, with even the trial judge, Hugo Friend, looking visibly pleased. The players and jury retired to an Italian restaurant and partied well into the night.

The jubilation proved short-lived. On August 3, Landis issued a statement:
Regardless of the verdict of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that undertakes or promises to throw a ball game; no player that sits in a conference with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don&#x27;t know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless of the verdict of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, both inside and outside the game.
According to ESPN columnist Rob Neyer, &quot;with that single decision, Landis might have done more for the sport than anyone else, ever. Certainly, Landis never did anything more important.&quot; According to Carney, &quot;The public amputation of the eight Sox was seen as the only acceptable cure.&quot; Over the years of Landis&#x27;s commissionership, a number of the players applied for reinstatement to the game, notably Jackson and Weaver. Jackson, raised in rural South Carolina and with limited education, was said to have been drawn unwillingly into the conspiracy, while Weaver, though admitting his presence at the meetings, stated that he took no money. Both men stated that their play on the field, and their batting percentages during the series (.375 for Jackson, .324 for Weaver) indicated that they did not help to throw the series. None was ever reinstated, with Landis telling a group of Weaver supporters that his presence at the meetings with the gamblers was sufficient to bar him. Even today, long after the deaths of all three men, efforts are periodically made to reinstate Jackson (which would make him eligible for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame) and Weaver (deemed by some the least culpable of the eight). In the 1990s, a petition drive to reinstate Jackson drew 60,000 signatures. He has been treated sympathetically in movies such as &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, and Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Feller expressed their support for Jackson&#x27;s induction into the Hall. Landis&#x27;s expulsion of the eight men remains in force.

==== Cracking down on gambling ====

Landis felt that the Black Sox scandal had been initiated by people involved in horse racing, and stated that &quot;by God, as long as I have anything to do with this game, they&#x27;ll never get another hold on it.&quot; In 1921, his first season as commissioner, New York Giants owner Charles Stoneham and manager John McGraw purchased Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba. Landis gave Stoneham and McGraw an ultimatum—they could not be involved in both baseball and horse racing. They quickly put the track back on the market.

Even before the Black Sox scandal had been resolved, Landis acted to clean up other gambling cases. Eugene Paulette, a first baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies, had been with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1919, and had met with gamblers. It is uncertain if any games were fixed, but Paulette had written a letter naming two other Cardinals who might be open to throwing games. The letter had fallen into the hands of Phillies president William F. Baker, who had taken no action until Landis&#x27;s appointment, then turned the letter over to him. Paulette met with Landis once, denying any wrongdoing, then refused further meetings. Landis placed him on the ineligible list in March 1921. In November 1921, Landis banned former St. Louis Browns player Joe Gedeon, who had been released by the Browns after admitting to sitting in on meetings with gamblers who were trying to raise the money to bribe the Black Sox. When a minor league official asked if he was eligible, Landis settled the matter by placing Gedeon on the ineligible list.

Two other player gambling affairs marked Landis&#x27;s early years as commissioner. In 1922, Giants pitcher Phil Douglas, embittered at McGraw for disciplining him for heavy drinking, wrote a letter to Cardinals outfielder Leslie Mann, suggesting that he would take a bribe to ensure the Giants did not win the pennant. Although Mann had been a friend, the outfielder neither smoked nor drank and had long been associated with the YMCA movement; according to baseball historian Lee Allen, Douglas might as well have sent the letter to Landis himself. Mann immediately turned over the letter to his manager, Branch Rickey, who ordered Mann to contact Landis at once. The Giants placed Douglas on the ineligible list, an action backed by Landis after meeting with the pitcher. On September 27, 1924, Giants outfielder Jimmy O&#x27;Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 if Sand didn&#x27;t &quot;bear down too hard against us today&quot;. Sand was initially inclined to let the matter pass, but recalling the fate of Weaver and other Black Sox players, told Art Fletcher, his manager. Fletcher met with Heydler, who contacted Landis. O&#x27;Connell did not deny the bribe attempt, and was placed on the ineligible list.

In total, Landis banned eighteen players from the game. Landis biographer Pietrusza details the effect of Landis&#x27;s stand against gambling:
Before 1920 if one player approached another player to throw a contest, there was a very good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver ... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis&#x27; unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, &quot;the scandals stopped&quot;.
==== Ruth-Meusel barnstorming incident ====

At the time of Landis&#x27;s appointment as commissioner, it was common for professional baseball players to supplement their pay by participating in postseason &quot;barnstorming&quot; tours, playing on teams which would visit smaller cities and towns to play games for which admission would be charged. Since 1911, however, players on the two World Series teams had been barred from barnstorming. The rule had been leniently enforced—in 1916, several members of the champion Red Sox, including pitcher George Herman &quot;Babe&quot; Ruth, had barnstormed and had been fined a token $100 each by the National Commission.

Ruth, who after the 1919 season had been sold to the Yankees, and who by then had mostly abandoned his pitching role for the outfield, was the focus of considerable fan interest as he broke batting records in 1920 and 1921, some by huge margins. Ruth&#x27;s major league record 29 home runs with the Red Sox in 1919 fell to his own efforts in 1920, when he hit 54. He then proceeded to hit 59 in 1921, leading the Yankees to their first pennant. Eight major league teams failed to hit as many home runs in 1921 as Ruth hit by himself. The Yankees lost the 1921 World Series to the Giants (Ruth was injured and missed several games) and after the series, the outfielder proposed to capitalize on fan interest by leading a team of barnstormers, including Yankees teammate Bob Meusel, in violation of the rule. According to Cottrell,
[T]he two men clashed who helped the national pastime overcome the Black Sox scandal, one through his seemingly iron will, the other thanks to his magical bat. Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis and Babe Ruth battled over the right of a ballplayer from a pennant-winning squad to barnstorm in the off-season. Also involved was the commissioner&#x27;s continued determination to display, as he had through his banishment of the Black Sox, that he had established the boundaries for organized baseball. These boundaries, Landis intended to demonstrate, applied even to the sport&#x27;s most popular and greatest star. Significant too, only Babe Ruth now contended with Commissioner Landis for the title of baseball&#x27;s most important figure.
Ruth had asked Yankees general manager Ed Barrow for permission to barnstorm. Barrow had no objection but warned Ruth he must obtain Landis&#x27;s consent. Landis biographer Spink, who was at the time the editor of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, stated, &quot;I can say that Ruth knew exactly what he was doing when he defied Landis in October, 1921. He was willing to back his own popularity and well-known drawing powers against the Judge.&quot; Ruth, to the commissioner&#x27;s irritation, did not contact Landis until October 15, one day before the first exhibition. When the two spoke by telephone, Landis ordered Ruth to attend a meeting with him; Ruth refused, stating that he had to leave for Buffalo for the first game. Landis angrily refused consent for Ruth to barnstorm, and after slamming down the receiver, is recorded as saying, &quot;Who the hell does that big ape think he is? That blankety-blank! If he goes on that trip it will be one of the sorriest things he has ever done.&quot; By one account, Yankees co-owner Colonel Tillinghast Huston attempted to dissuade Ruth as he departed, only to be told by the ballplayer, &quot;Aw, tell the old guy to jump in a lake.&quot;

The tour also featured fellow Yankees Meusel and Bill Piercy (who had been called up late in the season and was ineligible for the World Series) as well as Tom Sheehan, who had been sent to the minor leagues before the end of the season. Two other Yankees, Carl Mays and Wally Schang, had been scheduled to join the tour, but given Landis&#x27;s position, according to Spink, &quot;wisely decided to pass it up&quot;. Spink describes the tour as &quot;a fiasco.&quot; On Landis&#x27;s orders, it was barred from all major and minor league ballparks. In addition, it was plagued by poor weather, and was called off in late October. In early December, Landis suspended Ruth, Piercy, and Meusel until May 20, 1922. Yankees management was relieved; they had feared Landis would suspend Ruth for the season or even longer. Both the Yankees and Ruth repeatedly asked Landis for the players&#x27; early reinstatement, which was refused, and when Landis visited the Yankees during spring training in New Orleans, he lectured Ruth for two hours on obeying authority. &quot;He sure can talk&quot;, noted Ruth.

When Ruth returned on May 20, he batted 0-for-4, and was booed by the crowd at the Polo Grounds. According to Pietrusza, &quot;Always a politician, there was one boss Landis did fear: public opinion. He had no guarantee at the start of the Ruth controversy that the public and press would back him as he assumed unprecedented powers over baseball. Now, he knew they would.&quot;

=== Policies as commissioner ===

==== Major-minor league relations; development of the farm system ====

At the start of Landis&#x27;s commissionership, the minor league teams were for the most part autonomous of the major leagues; in fact the minor leagues independently chose to accept Landis&#x27;s rule. To ensure players did not become mired in the minor leagues without a chance to earn their way out, major league teams were able to draft players who played two consecutive years with the same minor league team. Several minor leagues were not subject to the draft; Landis fought for the inclusion of these leagues, feeling that the non-draft leagues could prevent players from advancing as they became more skilled. By 1924, he had succeeded, as the International League, the final holdout, accepted the draft.

By the mid-1920s, major league clubs were beginning to develop &quot;farm systems&quot;, that is, minor league teams owned or controlled by them, at which they could develop young prospects without the risk of the players being acquired by major league rivals. The pioneer in this development was Branch Rickey, who then ran the St. Louis Cardinals. As the 1921 National Agreement among the major and minor leagues which implemented Landis&#x27;s hiring lifted a ban on major league teams owning minor league ones, Landis was limited in his avenues of attack on Rickey&#x27;s schemes. Developing talent at little cost thanks to Rickey, the Cardinals dominated the National League, winning nine league titles in the years from 1926 to 1946.

Soon after Landis&#x27;s appointment, he surprised the major league owners by requiring that they disclose their minor league interests. Landis fought against the practice of &quot;covering up&quot;, using transfers between two teams controlled by the same major league team to make players ineligible for the draft. His first formal act as commissioner was to declare infielder Phil Todt a free agent, dissolving his contract with the St. Louis Browns (at the time run by Rickey, who soon thereafter moved across town to run the Cardinals); in 1928, he ruled future Hall of Famer Chuck Klein a free agent as he held the Cardinals had tried to cover Klein up by having him play in a league where they owned two affiliates. The following year, he freed Detroit Tigers prospect and future Hall of Famer Rick Ferrell, who attracted a significant signing bonus from the Browns. In 1936, Landis found that teenage pitching prospect Bob Feller&#x27;s signing by minor league club Fargo-Moorhead had been a charade; the young pitcher was for all intents and purposes property of the Cleveland Indians. However, Feller indicated that he wanted to play for Cleveland and Landis issued a ruling which required the Indians to pay damages to minor league clubs, but allowed them to retain Feller, who went on to a Hall of Fame career with the Indians.

Landis&#x27;s attempts to crack down on &quot;covering up&quot; provoked the only time he was ever sued by one of his owners. After the 1930 season, minor leaguer Fred Bennett, convinced he was being covered up by the Browns, petitioned Landis for his release. Landis ruled that the Browns could either keep Bennett on their roster for the entire 1931 season, trade him, or release him. Instead, Browns owner Phil Ball brought suit against Landis in his old court in Chicago. Federal judge Walter C. Lindley ruled for Landis, noting that the agreements and rules were intended to &quot;endow the Commissioner with all the attributes of a benevolent but absolute despot and all the disciplinary powers of the proverbial &quot;pater familias&quot;&quot;. Ball intended to appeal, but after a meeting between team owners and Landis in which the commissioner reminded owners of their agreement not to sue, decided to drop the case.

Landis had hoped that the large Cardinals farm system would become economically unfeasible; when it proved successful for the Cardinals, he had tolerated it for several years and was in a poor position to abolish it. In 1938, however, finding that the Cardinals effectively controlled multiple teams in the same league (a practice disliked by Landis), he freed 70 players from their farm system. As few of the players were likely prospects for the major leagues, Landis&#x27;s actions generated headlines, but had little effect on the Cardinals organization, and the development of the modern farm system, whereby each major league club has several minor league teams which it uses to develop talent, proceeded apace. Rob Neyer describes Landis&#x27;s effort as &quot;a noble effort in a good cause, but it was also doomed to fail.&quot;

==== Baseball color line ====
One of the most controversial aspects of Landis&#x27;s commissionership is the question of race. From 1884, black ballplayers were informally banned from organized baseball. No black ballplayer played in organized baseball during Landis&#x27;s commissionership; Rickey (then running the Brooklyn Dodgers) broke the color line by signing Jackie Robinson to play for the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, after Landis&#x27;s death. Robinson became the first African-American in the major leagues since the 19th century, playing with the Dodgers beginning in 1947.

According to contemporary newspaper columns, at the time of his appointment as commissioner, Landis was considered a liberal on race questions; two Chicago African-American newspapers defended him against the 1921 efforts to impeach him from his judgeship. However, a number of baseball authors have ascribed racism to Landis, who they say actively perpetuated baseball&#x27;s color line. James Bankes, in &quot;The Pittsburgh Crawfords&quot;, tracing the history of that Negro league team, states that Landis, whom the author suggests was a Southerner (Landis was born in Ohio and raised in Indiana), made &quot;little effort to disguise his racial prejudice during 25 years in office&quot; and &quot;remained a steadfast foe of integration&quot;. Negro league historian John Holway incorrectly termed Landis &quot;the hard-bitten Carolinian Kennesaw Mountain Landis&quot;. In a 2000 article in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine, writer Bruce Watson states that Landis &quot;upheld baseball&#x27;s unwritten ban on black players and did nothing to push owners toward integration&quot;. A number of authors say that Landis banned major league play against black teams for fear the white teams would lose, though they ascribe various dates for this action, and the Dodgers are known to have played black teams in and around their Havana spring training base as late as 1942.

Landis&#x27;s documented actions on race are inconsistent. In 1938, Yankee Jake Powell was interviewed by a radio station, and when asked what he did in the offseason, made comments that were interpreted as meaning he worked as a police officer and beat up African Americans. Landis suspended Powell for ten days. In June 1942, the Negro league Kansas City Monarchs played several games against the white &quot;Dizzy Dean All-Stars&quot; at major league ballparks, attracting large crowds. After three games, all won by the Monarchs, Landis ordered a fourth canceled, on the ground that the games were outdrawing major league contests. On one occasion, Landis intervened in Negro league affairs, though he had no jurisdiction to do so. The Crawfords lost a game to a white semi-pro team when their star catcher Josh Gibson dropped a pop fly, and Gibson was accused of throwing the game at the behest of gamblers. Landis summoned the black catcher to his office, interviewed him, and announced that Gibson was cleared of wrongdoing.

In July 1942, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher charged that there was a &quot;grapevine understanding&quot; keeping blacks out of baseball. He was summoned to Landis&#x27;s Chicago office, and after emerging from a meeting with the commissioner, alleged that he had been misquoted. Landis then addressed the press, and stated,
Negroes are not barred from organized baseball by the commissioner and never have been in the 21 years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.
In his 1961 memoir, &quot;Veeck as in Wreck&quot;, longtime baseball executive and owner Bill Veeck told of his plan, in 1942, to buy the Phillies and stock the team with Negro league stars. Veeck wrote that he told Landis, who reacted with shock, and soon moved to block the purchase. In his book, Veeck placed some of the blame on National League president Ford C. Frick, but later reserved blame exclusively for Landis, whom he accused of racism, stating in a subsequent interview, &quot;[a]fter all, a man who is named Kenesaw Mountain was not born and raised in the state of Maine.&quot; However, when Veeck was asked for proof of his allegations against Landis, he stated, &quot;I have no proof of that. I can only surmise.&quot; According to baseball historian David Jordan, &quot;Veeck, nothing if not a storyteller, seems to have added these embellishments, sticking in some guys in black hats, simply to juice up his tale.&quot;

In November 1943, Landis agreed after some persuasion that black sportswriter Sam Lacy should make a case for integration of organized baseball before the owners&#x27; annual meeting. Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor and advocate of civil rights, was a controversial figure for his affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson out, but at Landis&#x27;s suggestion, did not ask him any questions or begin any discussion with him.

Neyer noted that &quot;Landis has been blamed for delaying the integration of the major leagues, but the truth is that the owners didn&#x27;t want black players in the majors any more than Landis did. And it&#x27;s not likely that, even if Landis hadn&#x27;t died in 1944, he could have prevented Branch Rickey from bringing Jackie Robinson to the National League in 1947.&quot; The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America after Landis&#x27;s death in 1944 renamed its Most Valuable Player Awards after Landis, but removed his name in 2020 with a vote of 89 percent of voting members in favor. The president of the association said Landis had &quot;notably failed to integrate the game during his tenure&quot;.

C.C. Johnson Spink, son of Landis biographer J.G. Taylor Spink and his successor as editor of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, noted in the introduction to the reissue of his father&#x27;s biography of Landis,
K.M. Landis was quite human and not infallible. If, for example, he did drag his feet at erasing baseball&#x27;s color line, he was grievously wrong, but then so were many others of his post-Civil War generation.
==== World Series and All-Star Game; other innovations ====

Landis took full jurisdiction over the World Series, as a contest between representatives of the two major leagues. Landis was blamed when the umpires called a game on account of darkness with the score tied during the 1922 World Series, even though there was still light. Landis decided that such decisions in future would be made by himself, moved forward the starting time of World Series games in future years, and announced that proceeds from the tied game would be donated to charity. In the 1932 World Series, Landis ordered that tickets for Game One at Yankee Stadium only be sold as part of strips, forcing fans to purchase tickets for all Yankee home games during that Series. Bad weather and the poor economy resulted in a half-filled stadium, and Landis allowed individual game sales for Game Two. During the 1933 World Series, he instituted a rule that only he could throw a player out of a World Series game, a rule which followed the ejection of Washington Senator Heinie Manush by umpire Charley Moran. The following year, with the visiting Cardinals ahead of the Detroit Tigers, 9–0 in Game Seven, he removed Cardinal Joe Medwick from the game for his own safety when Medwick, the left fielder, was pelted with fruit by Tiger fans after Medwick had been involved in a fight with one of the Tigers. Spink notes that Landis would most likely not have done so were the game within reach of the Tigers. In the 1938 World Series, umpire Moran was hit by a wild throw and suffered facial injuries. He was able to continue, but the incident caused Landis to order that World Series games and All-Star Games be played with six umpires.

The All-Star Game began in 1933; Landis had been a strong supporter of the proposal for such a contest, and after the first game remarked, &quot;That&#x27;s a grand show, and it should be continued.&quot; He never missed an All-Star Game in his lifetime; his final public appearance was at the 1944 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh.

In 1928, National League ball clubs proposed an innovation whereby each team&#x27;s pitcher, usually the weakest hitter in the lineup, would not bat, but be replaced for the purposes of batting and base-running by a tenth player. There were expectations that at the interleague meetings that year, the National League teams would vote for it, and the American League teams against it, leaving Landis to cast the deciding vote. The proposal was withdrawn, and Landis did not disclose how he would have voted on this early version of the &quot;designated hitter&quot; rule.

Landis disliked the innovation of &quot;night baseball&quot;, played in the evening with the aid of artificial light, and sought to discourage it. Despite this, he attended the first successful minor league night game, in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1930. When major league night baseball began in the late 1930s, Landis got the owners to restrict the number of such games. During World War II, many restrictions on night baseball were reduced, with the Washington Senators permitted to play all their home games (except those on Sundays and holidays) at night.

=== World War II, death, and legacy ===

With the entry of the United States into World War II in late 1941, Landis wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, inquiring as to the wartime status of baseball. The President urged Landis to keep baseball open, foreseeing that even those fully engaged in war work would benefit from such inexpensive diversions. Many major leaguers enlisted or were drafted; even so Landis repeatedly stated, &quot;We&#x27;ll play as long as we can put nine men on the field.&quot; Although many of the teams practiced at their normal spring training sites in 1942, beginning the following year they were required to train near their home cities or in the Northeast. Landis was as virulently opposed to the Axis Powers as he had been towards the Kaiser, writing that peace would not be possible until &quot;about fifteen thousand little Hitler, Himmlers and Hirohitos&quot; were killed.

Landis retained a firm hold on baseball despite his advancing years and, in 1943, banned Phillies owner William D. Cox from baseball for betting on his own team. In 1927, Landis&#x27;s stance regarding gambling had been codified in the rules of baseball: &quot;Any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor had a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.&quot; Cox was required to sell his stake in the Phillies.

In early October 1944, Landis checked into St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Chicago, where his wife Winifred had been hospitalized, with a severe cold. While in the hospital, he had a heart attack, causing him to miss the World Series for the first time in his commissionership. He remained fully alert, and as usual signed the World Series share checks to players. His contract was due to expire in January 1946; on November 17, 1944, baseball&#x27;s owners voted him another seven-year term. However, he died on November 25. His longtime assistant, Leslie O&#x27;Connor, wept as he read the announcement for the press. Landis is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.

Two weeks after his death, Landis was voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by a special committee vote. American League president Will Harridge said of Landis, &quot;He was a wonderful man. His great qualities and downright simplicity impressed themselves deeply on all who knew him.&quot; Pietrusza suggests that the legend on Landis&#x27;s Hall of Fame plaque is his true legacy: &quot;His integrity and leadership established baseball in the esteem, respect, and affection of the American people.&quot; Pietrusza notes that Landis was hired by the baseball owners to clean up the sport, and &quot;no one could deny Kenesaw Mountain Landis had accomplished what he had been hired to do&quot;. According to his first biographer, Spink:
[Landis] may have been arbitrary, self-willed and even unfair, but he &#x27;called &#x27;em as he saw &#x27;em&#x27; and he turned over to his successor and the future a game cleansed of the nasty spots which followed World War I. Kenesaw Mountain Landis put the fear of God into weak characters who might otherwise have been inclined to violate their trust. And for that, I, as a lifelong lover of baseball, am eternally grateful.

<text>In geometry, a Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron is any of four regular star polyhedra.

They may be obtained by stellating the regular convex dodecahedron and icosahedron, and differ from these in having regular pentagrammic faces or vertex figures. They can all be seen as three-dimensional analogues of the pentagram in one way or another.

== Characteristics ==

=== Sizes ===
The great icosahedron edge length is formula_1 times the original icosahedron edge length.
The small stellated dodecahedron, great dodecahedron, and great stellated dodecahedron edge lengths are respectively formula_2 formula_3 and formula_4 times the original dodecahedron edge length.

=== Non-convexity ===
These figures have pentagrams (star pentagons) as faces or vertex figures. The small and great stellated dodecahedron have nonconvex regular pentagram faces. The great dodecahedron and great icosahedron have convex polygonal faces, but pentagrammic vertex figures.

In all cases, two faces can intersect along a line that is not an edge of either face, so that part of each face passes through the interior of the figure. Such lines of intersection are not part of the polyhedral structure and are sometimes called false edges. Likewise where three such lines intersect at a point that is not a corner of any face, these points are false vertices. The images below show spheres at the true vertices, and blue rods along the true edges.

For example, the small stellated dodecahedron has 12 pentagram faces with the central pentagonal part hidden inside the solid. The visible parts of each face comprise five isosceles triangles which touch at five points around the pentagon. We could treat these triangles as 60 separate faces to obtain a new, irregular polyhedron which looks outwardly identical. Each edge would now be divided into three shorter edges (of two different kinds), and the 20 false vertices would become true ones, so that we have a total of 32 vertices (again of two kinds). The hidden inner pentagons are no longer part of the polyhedral surface, and can disappear. Now Euler&#x27;s formula holds: 60 − 90 + 32 = 2. However, this polyhedron is no longer the one described by the Schläfli symbol {5/2, 5}, and so can not be a Kepler–Poinsot solid even though it still looks like one from outside.

=== Euler characteristic χ ===
A Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron covers its circumscribed sphere more than once, with the centers of faces acting as winding points in the figures which have pentagrammic faces, and the vertices in the others. Because of this, they are not necessarily topologically equivalent to the sphere as Platonic solids are, and in particular the Euler relation

:formula_5

does not always hold. Schläfli held that all polyhedra must have χ = 2, and he rejected the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron as proper polyhedra. This view was never widely held.

A modified form of Euler&#x27;s formula, using density (&quot;D&quot;) of the vertex figures (formula_6) and faces (formula_7) was given by Arthur Cayley, and holds both for convex polyhedra (where the correction factors are all 1), and the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra:
:formula_8

=== Duality and Petrie polygons ===

The Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra exist in dual pairs. Duals have the same Petrie polygon, or more precisely, Petrie polygons with the same two dimensional projection.

The following images show the two dual compounds with the same edge radius. They also show that the Petrie polygons are skew.
Two relationships described in the article below are also easily seen in the images: That the violet edges are the same, and that the green faces lie in the same planes.

=== Summary ===

== Relationships among the regular polyhedra ==

===Conway&#x27;s operational terminology===

John Conway defines the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra as &quot;greatenings&quot; and &quot;stellations&quot; of the convex solids.&lt;br&gt;
In his naming convention the small stellated dodecahedron is just the &quot;stellated dodecahedron&quot;.

&quot;Stellation&quot; changes pentagonal faces into pentagrams. (In this sense stellation is a unique operation, and not to be confused with the more general stellation described below.)

&quot;Greatening&quot; maintains the type of faces, shifting and resizing them into parallel planes.

===Stellations and facetings===

The great icosahedron is one of the stellations of the icosahedron. (See The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra)&lt;br&gt;
The three others are all the stellations of the dodecahedron.

The great stellated dodecahedron is a faceting of the dodecahedron.&lt;br&gt;
The three others are facetings of the icosahedron.

If the intersections are treated as new edges and vertices, the figures obtained will not be regular, but they can still be considered stellations.

(See also List of Wenninger polyhedron models)

===Shared vertices and edges===

The great stellated dodecahedron shares its vertices with the dodecahedron. The other three Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra share theirs with the icosahedron.


==The stellated dodecahedra==

===Hull and core===

The small and great stellated dodecahedron
can be seen as a regular and a great dodecahedron with their edges and faces extended until they intersect.&lt;br&gt;
The pentagon faces of these cores are the invisible parts of the star polyhedra&#x27;s pentagram faces.&lt;br&gt;
For the small stellated dodecahedron the hull is formula_9 times bigger than the core, and for the great it is formula_10 times bigger.
&lt;br&gt;


===Augmentations===

Traditionally the two star polyhedra have been defined as &quot;augmentations&quot; (or &quot;cumulations&quot;),
Kepler calls the small stellation an &quot;augmented dodecahedron&quot; (then nicknaming it &quot;hedgehog&quot;).

These naïve definitions are still used.
E.g. MathWorld states that the two star polyhedra can be constructed by adding pyramids to the faces of the Platonic solids.



==Symmetry==

All Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra have full icosahedral symmetry, just like their convex hulls.

The great icosahedron and its dual resemble the icosahedron and its dual in that they have faces and vertices on the 3-fold (yellow) and 5-fold (red) symmetry axes.&lt;br&gt;
In the great dodecahedron and its dual all faces and vertices are on 5-fold symmetry axes (so there are no yellow elements in these images).

The following table shows the solids in pairs of duals. In the top row they are shown with pyritohedral symmetry, in the bottom row with icosahedral symmetry (to which the mentioned colors refer).

The table below shows orthographic projections from the 5-fold (red), 3-fold (yellow) and 2-fold (blue) symmetry axes.

== History ==

Most, if not all, of the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra were known of in some form or other before Kepler. A small stellated dodecahedron appears in a marble tarsia (inlay panel) on the floor of St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Venice, Italy. It dates from the 15th century and is sometimes attributed to Paolo Uccello.

In his &quot;Perspectiva corporum regularium&quot; (&quot;Perspectives of the regular solids&quot;), a book of woodcuts published in 1568, Wenzel Jamnitzer depicts the great stellated dodecahedron and a great dodecahedron (both shown below). There is also a truncated version of the small stellated dodecahedron. It is clear from the general arrangement of the book that he regarded only the five Platonic solids as regular.

The small and great stellated dodecahedra, sometimes called the Kepler polyhedra, were first recognized as regular by Johannes Kepler around 1619. He obtained them by stellating the regular convex dodecahedron, for the first time treating it as a surface rather than a solid. He noticed that by extending the edges or faces of the convex dodecahedron until they met again, he could obtain star pentagons. Further, he recognized that these star pentagons are also regular. In this way he constructed the two stellated dodecahedra. Each has the central convex region of each face &quot;hidden&quot; within the interior, with only the triangular arms visible. Kepler&#x27;s final step was to recognize that these polyhedra fit the definition of regularity, even though they were not convex, as the traditional Platonic solids were.

In 1809, Louis Poinsot rediscovered Kepler&#x27;s figures, by assembling star pentagons around each vertex. He also assembled convex polygons around star vertices to discover two more regular stars, the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron. Some people call these two the Poinsot polyhedra. Poinsot did not know if he had discovered all the regular star polyhedra.

Three years later, Augustin Cauchy proved the list complete by stellating the Platonic solids, and almost half a century after that, in 1858, Bertrand provided a more elegant proof by faceting them.

The following year, Arthur Cayley gave the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra the names by which they are generally known today.

A hundred years later, John Conway developed a systematic terminology for stellations in up to four dimensions. Within this scheme the small stellated dodecahedron is just the &quot;stellated dodecahedron&quot;.

== Regular star polyhedra in art and culture ==

Regular star polyhedra first appear in Renaissance art. A small stellated dodecahedron is depicted in a marble tarsia on the floor of St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Venice, Italy, dating from ca. 1430 and sometimes attributed to Paulo Uccello.

In the 20th century, artist M. C. Escher&#x27;s interest in geometric forms often led to works based on or including regular solids; &quot;Gravitation&quot; is based on a small stellated dodecahedron.

A dissection of the great dodecahedron was used for the 1980s puzzle Alexander&#x27;s Star.

Norwegian artist Vebjørn Sand&#x27;s sculpture &quot;The Kepler Star&quot; is displayed near Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The star spans 14 meters, and consists of an icosahedron and a dodecahedron inside a great stellated dodecahedron.

<text> (), also spelled as Cracow or Krakow, is the second-largest and one of the oldest cities in Poland. Situated on the Vistula River in Lesser Poland Voivodeship, the city has a population of 804,237 (2023), with approximately 8 million additional people living within a radius. Kraków was the official capital of Poland until 1596, and has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish academic, cultural, and artistic life. Cited as one of Europe&#x27;s most beautiful cities, its Old Town was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978, one of the world&#x27;s first sites granted the status.

The city began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill and was a busy trading centre of Central Europe in 985. In 1038, it became the seat of Polish monarchs from the Piast dynasty, and subsequently served as the centre of administration under Jagiellonian kings and of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until the late 16th century, when Sigismund III transferred his royal court to Warsaw. With the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918, Kraków reaffirmed its role as the nucleus of a national spirit. After the invasion of Poland, at the start of World War II, the newly defined became the seat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s General Government. The Jewish population was forced into the Kraków Ghetto, a walled zone from where they were sent to Nazi extermination camps such as the nearby Auschwitz, and Nazi concentration camps like Płaszów. However, the city was spared from destruction. In 1978, Karol Wojtyła, archbishop of Kraków, was elevated to the papacy as Pope John Paul, the first non-Italian pope in 455 years.

The Old Town and historic centre of Kraków, along with the nearby Wieliczka Salt Mine, are Poland&#x27;s first World Heritage Sites. Its extensive cultural and architectural legacy across the epochs of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque architecture includes Wawel Cathedral and Wawel Royal Castle on the banks of the Vistula, St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica, Saints Peter and Paul Church, and the largest medieval market square in Europe, . Kraków is home to Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest universities in the world and often considered Poland&#x27;s most reputable academic institution of higher learning. The city also hosts a number of institutions of national significance, including the National Museum, Kraków Opera, Juliusz Słowacki Theatre, National Stary Theatre, and the Jagiellonian Library.

Kraków is classified as a global city with the ranking of &quot;high sufficiency&quot; by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is served by John Paul II International Airport, the country&#x27;s second busiest airport and the most important international airport for the inhabitants of south-eastern Poland. In 2000, Kraków was named European Capital of Culture. In 2013, Kraków was officially approved as a UNESCO City of Literature. The city hosted World Youth Day in 2016, and the European Games in 2023.

== Etymology ==
The name of Kraków is traditionally derived from Krakus (Krak, Grakch), the legendary founder of Kraków and a ruler of the early Medieval tribe of Vistulans. In Polish, is an archaic possessive form of &quot;Krak&quot; and essentially means &quot;Krak&#x27;s (town)&quot;. The true origin of the name is highly disputed among historians, with many theories in existence and no unanimous consensus. The first recorded mention of Prince Krakus (then written as &quot;Grakch&quot;) dates back to 1190, although the town existed as early as the seventh century, when it was inhabited by the tribe of Vistulans. It is possible that the name of the city is derived from the word , meaning &#x27;crow&#x27; or &#x27;raven&#x27;.

The city&#x27;s full official name is , which can be translated as &quot;Royal Capital City of Kraków&quot;. In English, a person born or living in Kraków is a Cracovian ( or ). Until the 1990s the English version of the name was often written as Cracow, but now the most widespread modern English version is Krakow.

== History ==

=== Origins and middle ages ===
Kraków&#x27;s early history begins with evidence of a Stone Age settlement on the present site of the Wawel Hill. A legend attributes Kraków&#x27;s founding to the mythical ruler Krakus, who built it above a cave occupied by a dragon, Smok Wawelski. The first written record of the city&#x27;s name dates back to 965, when Kraków was described as a notable commercial centre controlled first by Moravia (876–879), but captured by a Bohemian duke Boleslaus I in 955. The first acclaimed ruler of Poland, Mieszko I, took Kraków from the Bohemians and incorporated it into the holdings of the Piast dynasty towards the end of his reign.

In 1038, Kraków became the seat of the Polish government. By the end of the tenth century, the city was a leading centre of trade. Brick buildings were constructed, including the Royal Wawel Castle with St. Felix and Adaukt Rotunda, Romanesque churches such as St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, a cathedral, and a basilica. The city was sacked and burned during the Mongol invasion of 1241. It was rebuilt practically identically, based on new location act and incorporated in 1257 by the high duke Bolesław V the Chaste who following the example of Wrocław, introduced city rights modelled on the Magdeburg law allowing for tax benefits and new trade privileges for the citizens. In 1259, the city was again ravaged by the Mongols. A third attack in 1287 was repelled thanks in part to the newly built fortifications. In 1315 a large alliance of Poland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden was formed in Kraków.
In 1335, King Casimir III the Great () declared the two western suburbs to be a new city named after him, Kazimierz (). The defensive walls were erected around the central section of Kazimierz in 1362, and a plot was set aside for the Augustinian order next to Skałka. The city rose to prominence in 1364, when Casimir founded the University of Kraków, the second oldest university in central Europe after the Charles University in Prague.

The city continued to grow under the Jagiellonian dynasty. As the capital of the Kingdom of Poland and a member of the Hanseatic League, the city attracted many craftsmen from abroad, businesses, and guilds as science and the arts began to flourish. The royal chancery and the university ensured a first flourishing of Polish literary culture in the city.

=== Early modern period ===
The 15th and 16th centuries were known as Poland&#x27;s or Golden Age. Many works of Polish Renaissance art and architecture were created, including ancient synagogues in Kraków&#x27;s Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz, such as the Old Synagogue. During the reign of Casimir IV, various artists came to work and live in Kraków, and Johann Haller established a printing press in the city after Kasper Straube had printed the Calendarium Cracoviense, the first work printed in Poland, in 1473.

In 1520, the most famous church bell in Poland, named after Sigismund I of Poland, was cast by Hans Behem. At that time, Hans Dürer, a younger brother of artist and thinker Albrecht Dürer, was Sigismund&#x27;s court painter. Hans von Kulmbach made altarpieces for several churches. In 1553, the Kazimierz district council gave the Jewish Qahal (council of a Jewish self-governing community) a licence for the right to build their own interior walls across the western section of the already existing defensive walls. The walls were expanded again in 1608 due to the growth of the community and influx of Jews from Bohemia. In 1572, King Sigismund II, the last of the Jagiellons, died childless. The Polish throne passed to Henry III of France and then to other foreign-based rulers in rapid succession, causing a decline in the city&#x27;s importance. Furthermore, in 1596, Sigismund III of the House of Vasa moved the administrative capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from Kraków to Warsaw. The city was destabilised by pillaging in the 1650s during the Swedish invasion, especially during the 1655 siege. Later in 1707, the city underwent an outbreak of bubonic plague that left 20,000 of the city&#x27;s residents dead.

=== 19th century ===
Already weakened during the 18th century, by the mid-1790s the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had twice been partitioned by its neighbors: Russia, the Habsburg empire and Prussia. In 1791, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II changed the status of Kazimierz as a separate city and made it into a district of Kraków. The richer Jewish families began to move out. However, because of the injunction against travel on the Sabbath, most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues. In 1794, Tadeusz Kościuszko initiated an unsuccessful insurrection in the town&#x27;s Main Square which, in spite of his victorious Battle of Racławice against a numerically superior Russian army, resulted in the third and final partition of Poland. As a result, Kraków fell under Habsburg rule.

In 1802, German became the town&#x27;s official language. Of the members appointed by the Habsburgs to the municipal council only half were Polish. From 1796 to 1809, the population of the city rose from 22,000 to 26,000 with an increasing percentage of nobles and officials. In 1809, Napoleon Bonaparte captured former Polish territories from Austria and made the town part of the Duchy of Warsaw. During the time of the Duchy of Warsaw, requirements to upkeep the Polish army followed by tours of Austrian, Polish and Russian troops, plus Russian occupation and a flood in the year 1813 all added up to the adverse development of the city with a high debt burden on public finances and many workshops and trading houses needing to close their activities.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the 1815 Congress of Vienna restored the pre-war boundaries but also created the partially independent and neutral Free City of Kraków. In addition to the historic city of Kraków itself, the Free City included the towns of Chrzanow, Trzebinia and Nowa Gora and 224 villages. Outside the city, mining and metallurgy started developing. The population of Kraków itself grew in this time from 23,000 to 43,000; that of the overall republic from 88,000 to 103,000. The population of the city had an increasing number of Catholic clergy, officials and intelligentsia with which the rich townspeople sympathised. They were opposed to the conservative landed aristocracy who also were drawn more and more to the city real estates even though their income still mainly came from their agricultural possessions in the Republic, the Kingdom of Poland and Galicia. The percentage of the Jewish population in the city also increased in this time from 20.8% to 30.4%. However, nationalist sentiment and other political issues led to instability; this culminated in the Kraków uprising of 1846, which was crushed by the Austrian authorities. The Free City was therefore annexed into the Austrian Empire as the Grand Duchy of Kraków (, ), which was legally separate from but administratively part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (more simply Austrian Galicia).

During the era of the free city, a free trade zone led to positive economic development. But because of the unstable political situation and insecurity about the future, not much of the accumulated wealth was invested. Through the increase of taxes, customs and regulations, prices soared and the city fell into a recession. From 1844 to 1850 the population was diminished by over 4,000 inhabitants.

In 1866, Austria granted a degree of autonomy to Galicia after its own defeat in the Austro-Prussian War. Kraków, being politically freer than the Polish cities under Prussian (later German) and Russian rule, became a Polish national symbol and a centre of culture and art, known frequently as the &quot;Polish Athens&quot; (). Many leading Polish artists of the period resided in Kraków, among them the seminal painter Jan Matejko, laid to rest at Rakowicki Cemetery, and the founder of modern Polish drama, Stanisław Wyspiański. Fin de siècle Kraków evolved into a modern metropolis; running water and electric streetcars were introduced in 1901, and between 1910 and 1915, Kraków and its surrounding suburban communities were gradually combined into a single administrative unit called Greater Kraków ().

At the outbreak of World War I on 3 August 1914, Józef Piłsudski formed a small cadre military unit, the First Cadre Company—the predecessor of the Polish Legions—which set out from Kraków to fight for the liberation of Poland. The city was briefly besieged by Russian troops in November 1914. Austrian rule in Kraków ended in 1918 when the Polish Liquidation Committee assumed power.

=== 20th century to the present ===

Following the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918, Kraków resumed its role as a major Polish academic and cultural centre, with the establishment of new universities such as the AGH University of Science and Technology and the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, as well as several new and essential vocational schools. The city became an important cultural centre for Polish Jews, including both Zionist and Bundist groups. Kraków was also an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life, with all its manifestations of religious observance—from Orthodox to Hasidic and Reform Judaism—flourishing side by side.

Following the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, the city of Kraków became part of the General Government, a separate administrative region of the Third Reich. On 26 October 1939, the Nazi régime set up , one of four districts within the General Government. On the same day, the city of Kraków became the capital of the administration. The General Government was ruled by Governor-General Hans Frank, who was based in the city&#x27;s Wawel Castle. The Nazis envisioned turning Kraków into a completely Germanised city; after removal of all Jews and Poles, renaming of locations and streets into the German language, and sponsorship of propaganda portraying the city as historically German. On 28 November 1939, Frank set up (&#x27;Jewish Councils&#x27;) to be run by Jewish citizens for the purpose of carrying out orders for the Nazis. These orders included the registration of all Jewish people living in each area, the collection of taxes, and the formation of forced-labour groups. The Polish Home Army maintained a parallel underground administrative system.

At the outbreak of World War II, some 56,000 Jews resided in Kraków—almost one-quarter of a total population of about 250,000; by November 1939, the Jewish population of the city had grown to approximately 70,000. According to German statistics from 1940, over 200,000 Jews lived within the entire Kraków District, comprising more than 5 percent of the district&#x27;s total population. However, these statistics probably underestimate the situation. In November 1939, during an operation known as (&#x27;special operation Kraków&#x27;), the Germans arrested more than 180 university professors and academics, and sent them to the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps, though the survivors were later released on the request of prominent Italians.

Before the formation of ghettos, which began in the Kraków District in December 1939, Jews were encouraged to flee the city. For those who remained, the German authorities decided in March 1941 to allocate a then-suburban neighborhood, Podgórze District, to become Kraków&#x27;s ghetto, where many Jews subsequently died of illness or starvation. Initially, most ghettos were open and Jews were allowed to enter and exit freely, but as security became tighter the ghettos were generally closed. From autumn 1941, the SS developed the policy of extermination through labour, which further worsened the already bleak conditions for Jews. The inhabitants of the Kraków Ghetto were later murdered or sent to German extermination camps, including Bełżec and Auschwitz, and to Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp. The largest deportations within the Distrikt occurred from June to September 1942. More specifically, mass deportation from Kraków&#x27;s ghetto occurred in the first week of June 1942, and the ghetto was finally liquidated in March 1943.

The film director Roman Polanski survived the Kraków Ghetto. Oskar Schindler selected employees from the ghetto to work in his enamelware factory , saving them from the camps. Similarly, many men capable of physical labor were saved from deportation to extermination camps and instead sent to labor camps across the General Government. By September 1943, the last of the Jews from the Kraków Ghetto had been deported. Although looted by occupational authorities, Kraków remained relatively undamaged at the end of World War II, with most of the city&#x27;s historical and architectural legacy spared. Soviet forces under the command of Marshal Ivan Konev entered the city on 18 January 1945, and began arresting Poles loyal to the Polish government-in-exile or those who had served in the Home Army.

After the war, under the Polish People&#x27;s Republic (officially declared in 1952), the intellectual and academic community of Kraków came under complete political control. The universities were soon deprived of their printing rights and autonomy. The Stalinist government of Poland ordered the construction of the country&#x27;s largest steel mill in the newly created suburb of Nowa Huta. The creation of the giant Lenin Steelworks (now Sendzimir Steelworks owned by Mittal) sealed Kraków&#x27;s transformation from a university city into an industrial centre.

In an effort that spanned two decades, Karol Wojtyła, the cardinal archbishop of Kraków from 1964 to 1978, successfully lobbied for permission to build the first churches in the newly industrialized suburbs. In 1978, the Catholic Church elevated Wojtyła to the papacy as John Paul II, the first non-Italian pope in over 450 years. In the same year, UNESCO, following the application of local authorities, placed Kraków Old Town on the first list of World Heritage Sites.

== Geography ==
Kraków lies in the southern part of Poland, on the Vistula River, approximately above sea level. The city is located on the border between different physiographic regions: the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland in the north-western parts of the city, the Małopolska Upland in the north-east, the Sandomierz Basin (east) and the Western Beskidian Foothills of the Carpathians (south).

There are five nature reserves in Kraków, with a combined area of ca. . Due to their ecological value, these areas are legally protected. The western part of the city, along its northern and north-western side, borders an area of international significance known as the Jurassic Bielany-Tyniec refuge. The main motives for the protection of this area include plant and animal wildlife and the area&#x27;s geomorphological features and landscape. Another part of the city is located within the ecological &#x27;corridor&#x27; of the Vistula River valley. This corridor is also assessed as being of international significance as part of the Pan-European ecological network.

=== Climate ===
Kraków has a humid continental climate, denoted by Köppen classification as &quot;Dfb&quot;, somewhat boardering on an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;); with climate change winters are rapidly becoming milder, and hot summers days above 30C are increasingly common, but with winter temperatures on average still below freezing, it is perhaps best defined as having a semicontinental climate. In older reference periods it was classified as a warm summer continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). By classification of Wincenty Okołowicz, it has a warm temperate climate in the centre of continental Europe with the &quot;fusion&quot; of different features.

Due to its geographic location, the city may be under marine influence, sometimes Arctic influence, but without direct influence, giving the city variable meteorological conditions over short spaces of time. The city lies in proximity to the Tatra Mountains and there are often occurrences of a foehn wind called halny, causing temperatures to rise rapidly. In relation to Warsaw, temperatures are very similar for most of the year, except that in the colder months southern Poland has a larger daily temperature range, more moderate winds, generally more rainy days and with greater chances of clear skies on average, especially in winter. The higher sun angle also allows for a longer growing season. In addition, for older data there was less sun than the capital of the country, about 30 minutes daily per year, but both have small differences in relative humidity and the direction of the winds is northeast.

The climate table below presents weather data with averages from 1991 to 2020, sunshine ranges from 1971 to 2000, and valid extremes from 1951 to the present day:

== Cityscape ==


Kraków provides a showcase setting for many historic forms of architecture developed over the ten centuries, especially Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque styles. Renowned artisans and skilled craftsmen from present-day Italy and Germany were brought and sponsored by kings or nobles who contributed to architectural wealth and diversity. The Brick Gothic manner as well as countless structural elements such as the Renaissance attics with decorative pinnacles became recognisable features of historical buildings in Kraków. Built from its earliest nucleus outward, the city&#x27;s monuments can be seen in historical order by walking from the city centre out, towards its newer districts.

Kraków&#x27;s historic centre, which includes the Old Town (&quot;Stare Miasto&quot;), the Main Market Square (&quot;Rynek Główny&quot;), the Cloth Hall (&quot;Sukiennice&quot;), the Barbican (&quot;Barbakan&quot;), St. Florian&#x27;s Gate, Kazimierz and the Wawel Castle, was included as the first of its kind on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1978. The central core surrounded by Planty Park remains the most prominent example of an old town in the country, with the medieval street layout still in existence. Kraków was the royal capital of Poland for many centuries, until Sigismund III Vasa relocated the court to Warsaw in 1596. The district is bisected by the Royal Road, the coronation route traversed by the Kings of Poland. Several important monuments were lost in the course of history, notably the Ratusz town hall. However, the Gothic Town Hall Tower measuring in height remains standing.

In addition to the old town, the city&#x27;s district of Kazimierz is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, as well as the historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major, permanent bridge (&quot;Pons Regalis&quot;) across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Kraków to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.

By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially registered synagogues and prayer houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like Podgórze. This, in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz and the development of new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings, however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.

As the city of Kraków began to expand further under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the new architectural styles also developed. Key buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries in Kraków include the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, the directorate of the Polish State Railways as well as the original complex of Kraków Główny railway station and the city&#x27;s Academy of Economics. It was also at around that time that Kraków&#x27;s first radial boulevards began to appear, with the city undergoing a large-scale program aimed at transforming the ancient Polish capital into a sophisticated regional centre of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. New representative government buildings and multi-story tenement houses were built at around that time. Much of the urban-planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in Vienna. Some major projects of the era include the development of the Jagiellonian University&#x27;s new premises and the building of the Collegium Novum just west of the Old Town. The imperial style planning of the city&#x27;s further development continued until the return of Poland&#x27;s independence, following the First World War. Early modernist style in Kraków is represented by such masterpieces as the Palace of Art by Franciszek Mączyński and the &#x27;House under the Globe&#x27;. Secession style architecture, which had arrived in Kraków from Vienna, became popular towards the end of the Partitions.

With Poland&#x27;s regained independence came the major change in the fortunes of Kraków—now the second most important city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style. Important buildings constructed in the style of Polish modernism include the Feniks &#x27;LOT&#x27; building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the Main Square and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepański Square. The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.

After the Second World War, new Communist government adopted Stalinist monumentalism. The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland, as in other countries of the Eastern Bloc, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists.&lt;ref name=&quot;inyourpocket/sightseeing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.

Since the style of the Renaissance was generally regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also used for augmenting Poland&#x27;s Socialist national format. However, in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists. From 1953, critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent, and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of Stalinism. The soc-realist centre of Nowa Huta is considered to be a meritorious monument of the times. This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass-construction of large Panel System apartment blocks, most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not encroach upon the beauty of the old or new towns. Some examples of the new style (e.g., Hotel Cracovia) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the latter half of the 20th century in Kraków.

After the Revolutions of 1989 and the birth of the Third Republic in the latter half of the 20th century, a number of new architectural projects were completed, including the construction of large business parks and commercial facilities such as the Galeria Krakowska, or infrastructure investments like the Kraków Fast Tram. A good example of this would be the Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology designed by Arata Isozaki, the 2007-built &quot;Pawilon Wyspiański 2000&quot;, which is used as a multi-purpose information and exhibition space, or the Małopolski Garden of Arts (&quot;Małopolski Ogród Sztuki&quot;), a multi-purpose exhibition and theatre complex located in the historic Old Town.
=== Parks and gardens ===

There are about 40 parks in Kraków, including dozens of gardens and forests. Several, like the Planty Park, Botanical Garden, Zoological Garden, Royal Garden, Park Krakowski, Jordan Park and Błonia Park are located in the centre of the city; with others, such as Zakrzówek, Wanda Green Ravine Park, Wolski forest, Strzelecki Park and Lotników Park in the surrounding districts. Parks cover about of the city.

The best-known park in Kraków is the Planty Park. Established between 1822 and 1830 in place of the old city walls, it forms a green belt around the Old Town and consists of a chain of smaller gardens designed in various styles and adorned with monuments. The park has an area of and a length of , forming a scenic walkway popular with Cracovians.

Jordan Park, founded in 1889 by Henryk Jordan, was the first public park of its kind in Europe. Built on the banks of the Rudawa, the park was equipped with running and exercise tracks, playgrounds, a swimming pool, amphitheatre, pavilions, and a pond for boat rowing and water bicycles. It is located in the grounds of one of the city&#x27;s larger parks, Błonia Park. The less prominent Park Krakowski, founded in 1885 by Stanisław Rehman, was a popular destination point for Cracovians at the end of the 19th century, but has since been greatly reduced in size because of rapid real estate development.

=== Environment ===
There are five nature reserves in Kraków with a total area of . Smaller green zones constitute parts of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland Jurassic Landscape Parks&#x27; Board, which deals with the protection areas of the Polish Jura. Under its jurisdiction are: the Bielany-Tyniec Landscape Park (Park Bielańsko-Tyniecki), Tenczynek Landscape Park (Park Tencziński) and Kraków Valleys Landscape Park (Park Krajobrazowy Dolinki Krakowskie), with their watersheds. The natural reserves of the Polish Jura Chain are part of the CORINE biotopes programme due to their unique flora, fauna, geomorphology and landscape. The western part of Kraków constitutes the so-called Obszar Krakowski ecological network, including the ecological corridor of the Vistula. The southern slopes of limestone hills provide conditions for the development of thermophilous vegetation, grasslands and shrubs.

The city is spaced along an extended latitudinal transect of the Vistula River Valley with a network of tributaries including its right tributary Wilga, and left: Rudawa, Białucha, Dłubnia and Sanka. The rivers and their valleys along with bodies of water are some of the most interesting natural wonders of Kraków.

Kraków and its environment, surrounded by mountains, suffer from Europe&#x27;s dirtiest air pollution because of smog, caused by burning coal for heating, especially in winter.

== Governance ==
The Kraków City Council has 43 elected members, one of whom is the mayor, or President of Kraków, elected every four years. The election of the City Council and of the local head of government, which takes place at the same time, is based on legislation introduced on 20 June 2002. The President of Kraków, re-elected for his fourth term in 2014, is Jacek Majchrowski. Several members of the Polish national Parliament (Sejm) are elected from the Kraków constituency. The city&#x27;s official symbols include a coat of arms, a flag, a seal, and a banner.
Responsibilities of Kraków&#x27;s president include drafting and implementing resolutions, enacting city bylaws, managing the city budget, employing city administrators, and preparing against floods and natural disasters. The president fulfills his duties with the help of the City Council, city managers and city inspectors. In the 1990s, the city government was reorganised to better differentiate between its political agenda and administrative functions. As a result, the Office of Public Information was created to handle inquiries and foster communication between city departments and citizens at large.

In 2000, the city government introduced a new long-term program called &quot;Safer City&quot; in cooperation with the Police, Traffic, Social Services, Fire, Public Safety, and the Youth Departments. Subsequently, the number of criminal offences dropped by 3 percent between 2000 and 2001, and the rate of detection increased by 1.4 percent to a total of 30.2 percent in the same period. The city is receiving help in carrying out the program from all educational institutions and the local media, including TV, radio and the press.

=== Districts ===

Kraków is divided into 18 administrative districts (&quot;dzielnica&quot;) or boroughs, each with a degree of autonomy within its own municipal government. Prior to March 1991, the city had been divided into four quarters which still give a sense of identity to Kraków: the towns of Podgórze, Nowa Huta and Krowodrza, which were amalgamated into the city as it expanded; and the ancient town centre of Kraków itself.

The oldest neighborhoods of Kraków were incorporated into the city before the late 18th century. These include the Old Town (&quot;Stare Miasto&quot;), once contained within the city defensive walls and now encircled by the Planty park; the Wawel District, which is the site of the Royal Castle and the cathedral; Stradom and Kazimierz with its historic Jewish quarter, the latter originally divided into Christian and Jewish quarters; and the ancient town of Kleparz.

Major districts added in the 19th and 20th centuries include Podgórze—until 1915, a separate town on the southern bank of the Vistula—and Nowa Huta, to the east of the city centre, which was built after World War II.

Among the most notable historic districts of the city are: Wawel Hill, home to Wawel Castle and Wawel Cathedral, where many historic Polish kings are buried; the medieval Old Town, with its Main Market Square; dozens of old churches and museums; the 14th-century buildings of the Jagiellonian University; and Kazimierz, the historical centre of Kraków&#x27;s Jewish social and religious life.

The Old Town district of Kraków is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art. Its rich variety of heritage architecture includes Romanesque (e.g. St. Andrew&#x27;s Church), Renaissance (e.g. Kraków Cloth Hall), Baroque (e.g. Saints Peter and Paul Church) and Gothic buildings. Kraków&#x27;s palaces, churches, theatres and mansions display a great variety of color, architectural details, stained glass, paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.

In the Market Square stands the Gothic St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica (&quot;Kościół Mariacki&quot;). Rebuilt in the 14th century, it features the famous wooden altar (Altarpiece of Veit Stoss), the largest Gothic altarpiece in the world, carved by Veit Stoss. A trumpet call (&quot;hejnał mariacki&quot;) is sounded every hour from the church&#x27;s main tower. The melody, which used to announce the opening and closing of city gates, ends unexpectedly in midstream. According to legend, the tune was played during the 13th-century Tatar invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack. Whilst playing, he was shot by an archer of the invading Tatar forces and the bugle call broke off at the moment he died. The story is recounted in Eric P. Kelly 1928 book &quot;The Trumpeter of Krakow&quot;, which won a Newbery Award.

The current divisions were introduced by the Kraków City Hall on 19 April 1995. The districts were each assigned a Roman numeral as well as a name: Stare Miasto (I), Grzegórzki (II), Prądnik Czerwony (III), Prądnik Biały (IV), Krowodrza (V), Bronowice (VI), Zwierzyniec (VII), Dębniki (VIII), Łagiewniki-Borek Fałęcki (IX), Swoszowice (X), Podgórze Duchackie (XI), Bieżanów-Prokocim (XII), Podgórze (XIII), Czyżyny (XIV), Mistrzejowice (XV), Bieńczyce (XVI), Wzgórza Krzesławickie (XVII), and Nowa Huta (XVIII).

== Economy ==
Kraków is one of Poland&#x27;s most important economic centres and the economic hub of the Lesser Poland (Małopolska) region. Since the fall of communism, the private sector has been growing steadily. There are about 50 large multinational companies in the city, including Google, Uber, IBM, Shell, UBS, HSBC, Motorola, Aptiv, MAN, General Electric, ABB, Aon, Akamai, Cisco, Hitachi, Altria, Capgemini, and Sabre Holdings, along with other British, German and Scandinavian-based firms. The city is also the global headquarters for Comarch, an enterprise software house. Kraków is the second most-visited city in Poland (after Warsaw). According to the World Investment Report 2011 by the UN Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Kraków is also the most emergent city location for investment in global BPO projects (Business Process Outsourcing) in the world.
In 2011, the city budget, which is presented by the Mayor of Kraków on 15 November annually, has a projected revenue of 3,500,000,000 złoty. The primary sources of revenue were as follows: 14% from the municipal taxation on real estate properties and the use of amenities, 30% in transfers from the national budget, and 34% in state subsidies. Projected expenditures, totaling 3,520,000,000 złoty, included 21% in city development costs and 79% in city maintenance costs. Of the maintenance costs, as much as 39% were spent on education and childcare. The City of Kraków&#x27;s development costs included; 41% toward construction of roads, transport, and communication (combined), and 25% for the city&#x27;s infrastructure and environment. The city has a high bond credit rating, and some 60% of the population is under the age of 45.

Unity Tower was completed in 2020 after almost 30 years, creating a new business and residential centre. It is the second-tallest building in the city after K1.

=== Knowledge and innovation community ===
Kraków is one of the co-location centres of Knowledge and Innovation Community (Sustainable Energy) of The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).

InnoEnergy is an integrated alliance of reputable organisations from the education, research and industry sectors. It was created based on long standing links of cooperation as well as the principles of excellence. The partners have jointly developed a strategy to tackle the weaknesses of the European innovation landscape in the field of sustainable energy.

== Transport ==

Public transport is based on a fairly dense network of tram and bus routes operated by a municipal company, supplemented by a number of private minibus operators. There is no rapid transit system in Kraków, but metro line is planned. First works are expected to commence in 2028. Local trains connect some of the suburbs. The bulk of the city&#x27;s historic area has been turned into a pedestrian zone with rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages; however, the trams run within a three-block radius. The historic means of transportation in the city can be examined at the Museum of Municipal Engineering in the Kazimierz district, with many old trams, cars and buses.

Railway connections are available to most Polish cities, e.g. Katowice, Częstochowa, Szczecin, Gdynia and Warsaw. International destinations include Bratislava, Budapest, Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Hamburg, Lviv, Kyiv, and Odesa (June–September). The main railway station is located just outside the Old Town District and is well-served by public transport.

Kraków&#x27;s airport, officially named Kraków John Paul II International Airport , is located west of the city. Direct trains cover the route between Kraków Główny train station and the airport in 20 minutes. Kraków Airport served around 5,800,000 passengers in 2017. Also, the Katowice International Airport is located or about 75 minutes from Kraków.

In Autumn 2016 Poland&#x27;s oldest Bicycle-sharing system was modernized and now offers 1,500 bikes at 169 stations under the name of Wavelo &quot;(pl)&quot;, which is owned by BikeU of the French multinational company Egis.

== Demographics ==
Kraków had a recorded population of 774,839 in 2019, which increased to 804,237 in 2023. Selected demographic indicators are presented in a table (below), compiled on the basis of only the population living in Kraków permanently. The larger metropolitan area of the city encompasses a territory in which (in 2010) 1,393,893 inhabitants live.

Already in the Middle Ages, the population of Kraków consisting of numerous ethnic groups, began to grow rapidly. It doubled between 1100 and 1300 from 5,000 to 10,000, and in 1400 counted 14,000 inhabitants. By 1550, the population of metropolitan Kraków was 18,000; although it decreased to 15,000 in the next fifty years due to calamity. By the early 17th century the Kraków population had reached 28,000 inhabitants.

In the historical 1931 census preceding World War II, 78.1% of Cracovians declared Polish as their primary language, with Yiddish or Hebrew at 20.9%, Ukrainian 0.4%, German 0.3%, and Russian 0.1%. The ravages of history have greatly reduced the percentage of ethnic minorities living in Kraków.

In the last two decades, Kraków has seen a large growth of immigrant population. In the 2002 census, only 0.25% of respondents living in the city declared a non-Polish nationality primarily Ukrainian and Russian. As of 2019, it was estimated that foreigners accounted for as much as 10% of the city&#x27;s population, with Ukrainians being the most numerous group (between 11,000 and 50,000).
;Population growth in Kraków since 1791
=== Religion ===

The metropolitan city of Kraków is known as the city of churches. The abundance of historic landmark temples along with the plenitude of monasteries and convents earned the city a countrywide reputation as the &quot;Northern Rome&quot; in the past. The churches of Kraków comprise over 120 places of worship (2007) of which over 65 were built in the 20th century. More are still being added. In addition to Roman Catholicism, other denominations present include Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Mariavite Church, Polish Catholic Church, Polish Orthodox Church, Protestantism and Latter-Day Saints. As of 2017, weekly Mass attendance in the Archdiocese of Kraków was 49.9 percent, above the national Polish average of 38.3 percent.

Kraków contains also an outstanding collection of monuments of Jewish sacred architecture unmatched anywhere in Poland. Kraków was an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life before the outbreak of World War II, with all its manifestations of religious observance from Orthodox to Hasidic and Reform flourishing side by side. There were at least 90 synagogues in Kraków active before the Nazi German invasion of Poland, serving its burgeoning Jewish community of 60,000–80,000 (out of the city&#x27;s total population of 237,000), established since the early 12th century.

Most synagogues of Kraków were ruined during World War II by the Nazis who despoiled them of all ceremonial objects, and used them as storehouses for ammunition, firefighting equipment, as general storage facilities and stables. The post-Holocaust Jewish population of the city had dwindled to about 5,900 before the end of the 1940s. Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah (emigration to Israel) without visas or exit permits upon the conclusion of World War II. In recent time, thanks to efforts of the local Jewish and Polish organisations including foreign financial aid from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, many synagogues underwent major restorations and serve religious and tourist purposes.

<text>The kora (Manding languages: &quot;kɔra&quot;) is a stringed instrument used extensively in West Africa. A kora typically has 21 strings, which are played by plucking with the fingers. It has features of the lute and harp.

==Description==
The kora is built from a gourd, cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator with a long hardwood neck. The skin is supported by two handles that run underneath it. It has 21 strings, each of which plays a different note. These strings are supported by a notched, double free-standing bridge. The kora doesn&#x27;t fit into any one category of musical instrument, but rather several, and must be classified as a &quot;double-bridge-harp-lute.&quot; The strings run in two divided ranks, characteristic of a double harp. They do not end in a soundboard but are instead held in notches on a bridge, classifying it as a bridge harp. The strings originate from a string arm or neck and cross a bridge directly supported by a resonating chamber, also making it a lute.

The sound of a kora resembles that of a harp, though when played in the traditional style it bears resemblance to a guitar played using the flamenco or Delta blues technique of plucking polyrhythmic patterns with both hands (using the remaining fingers to secure the instrument by holding the hand posts on either side of the strings). Ostinato riffs (&quot;kumbengo&quot;) and improvised solo runs (&quot;birimintingo&quot;) are played at the same time by skilled players.

Kora players have traditionally come from jali families (also from the Mandinka tribes) who are traditional historians, genealogists and storytellers who pass their skills on to their descendants. Though played in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Senegal, the instrument was first discovered in the Gambia. While those from neighbouring Guinea were known to carry the lute, Senegalese Griots were known as carriers of a hand drum known as the &#x27;sabar&#x27;. Most West African musicians prefer the term &quot;jali&quot; to &quot;griot,&quot; which is the French word. &quot;Jali&quot; means something similar to a &quot;bard&quot; or oral historian.

Traditional koras feature strings, eleven played by the left hand and ten by the right. Modern koras made in the Casamance region of southern Senegal sometimes feature additional bass strings, adding up to four strings to the traditional 21. Strings were traditionally made from thin strips of hide, such as cow or antelope skin. Today, most strings are made from harp strings or nylon fishing line, sometimes plaited together to create thicker strings.

A vital accessory in the past was the nyenmyemo, a leaf-shaped plate of tin or brass with wire loops threaded around the edge. Clamped to the bridge, or the top end of the neck it produced sympathetic sounds, serving as an amplifier since the sound carried well into the open air. In today&#x27;s environment, players usually prefer or need an electronic pickup.

By moving the konso (a system of leather tuning rings) up and down the neck, a kora player can retune the instrument into one of four seven-note scales. These scales are close in tuning to western major, minor and Lydian modes.

==History==

===Possible Antecedents===
In the 1300s, the traveller Ibn Battuta mentioned that the women who accompanied Dugha to perform were carrying bows that they plucked. He did not mention the number of strings, but this clearly shows the existence of harp instruments in 14th century Mali and could be the earliest written reference to the kora. The kora is designed like a bow with a gourd, similarly to Ibn Battuta&#x27;s description, but Battuta did not go into enough detail about the instruments for them to be identifiable. 

===Legendary Origin===
Mandinka oral tradition preserves several legends of the origin of the kora, but all of them claim that the instrument originated in Kaabu. In the stories, the famous Jali Mady Wouling Cissoko purchased the instrument from a djinn or spirit. and was the first person to play the kora, the first song played was kelefaba.

===Modern history===
The earliest European reference to the kora in Western literature is in &quot;Travels in Interior Districts of Africa&quot; (1799) by the Scotsman 
Mungo Park. 

The kora is mentioned in the Senegalese national anthem &quot;Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons.&quot;

In the late 20th century, a 25-string model of the kora was developed, though it has been adopted by only a few players, primarily in the region of Casamance, in southern Senegal. Some kora players such as Seckou Keita have double necked koras, allowing them to switch from one tuning to another within seconds, giving them increased flexibility.

The French Benedictine monks of the Keur Moussa Abbey in Senegal (who possibly were the first to introduce guitar machine heads instead of leather rings in the late seventies) conceived a method based on scores to teach the instrument. Brother Dominique Catta, choirmaster of the Keur Moussa Abbey, was the first Western composer who wrote for the kora (solo pieces as well as duets with Western instruments).

An electric instrument modeled on the kora (but made primarily of metal) called the gravikord was invented in the late 20th century by instrument builder and musician Robert Grawi. It has 24 strings and is tuned and played differently than the kora. Another instrument, the gravi-kora, a 21-stringed electro-acoustic instrument, was later developed by Robert Grawi especially for kora players who wanted a modern instrument. Its playing and tuning are the same as the traditional kora. The gravi-kora has been adopted by kora players such as Daniel Berkman, Jacques Burtin, and Foday Musa Suso, who featured it in recordings with jazz innovator Herbie Hancock, with his band &quot;Mandingo&quot;, and on Suso&#x27;s &quot;New World Power&quot; album.

==Tuning==
Nowadays, koras are increasingly made with guitar machine heads instead of the traditional konso (leather rings). The advantage is that they are much easier to tune. The disadvantage is that this design limits the tuning range of the instrument because string lengths are more fixed and lighter strings are needed to lift it much more than a tone. Learning to tune a traditional kora is arguably as difficult as learning to play it, and many tourists who are entranced by the sound while in West Africa buy koras and then find themselves unable to keep it in tune once they are home, relegating it to the status of ornament. Koras can be converted to replace the leather rings with machine heads. Wooden pegs and harp pegs are also used, but both can still cause tuning problems in damper climates unless made with great skill.

== Scores ==

As part of the oral tradition of West Africa, music for the kora was not written until the 20th century. Ethnomusicologists were the only ones to record some traditional airs in the normal grand staff method, using the G clef and the F clef.

Today, kora scores are written on a single G clef, following the Keur Moussa notation system. This notation system was created for the kora in the late 1970s by Brother Dominique Catta, a monk of the Keur Moussa Monastery (Senegal). The seven low notes that should be written on the F clef are replaced by Arabic or Roman numerals and written on the G clef.

While jali still compose in the traditional way (without writing scores), some Western musicians began to write partitures for the kora and adopted the Keur Moussa notation system at the beginning of the 1980s. More than 200 scores have already been written for kora solo or kora and Western instruments. Two notable Western composers for the kora are Brother Dominique Catta and Jacques Burtin (France), who wrote most of these scores, though composers like Carole Ouellet (Canada), Brother Grégoire Philippe (Monastère de Keur Moussa) and Sister Claire Marie Ledoux (France) have also contributed with their own original works.

Derek Gripper (Cape Town, South Africa) has transcribed a number of West African kora compositions by Toumani Diabaté and others for performance on western-style classical guitar, and has performed some of these transcriptions on two recordings and in concert from 2012 through 2017.

<text>Dame Kathleen Mary Kenyon, (5 January 1906 – 24 August 1978) was a British archaeologist of Neolithic culture in the Fertile Crescent. She led excavations of Tell es-Sultan, the site of ancient Jericho, from 1952 to 1958, and has been called one of the most influential archaeologists of the 20th century. She was Principal of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 1962 to 1973, having undertaken her own studies at Somerville College, Oxford.

==Biography==
Kathleen Kenyon was born in London, England, in 1906. She was the eldest daughter of Sir Frederic Kenyon, biblical scholar and later director of the British Museum. Her grandfather was lawyer and Fellow of All Souls College, John Robert Kenyon, and her great-great-grandfather was the politician and lawyer Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon. She grew up in Bloomsbury, in a house attached to the British Museum, with her mother, Amy Kenyon, and sister Nora Kenyon. Known for being hard-headed and stubborn, Kathleen grew up as a tomboy, fishing, climbing trees and playing a variety of sports.

Determined that she and her sister should be well educated, Kathleen&#x27;s father encouraged wide reading and independent study. In later years Kenyon would remark that her father&#x27;s position at the British Museum was particularly helpful for her education. Kathleen was an excellent student, winning awards at school and particularly excelling in history. She studied first at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, where she was head girl, before winning an Exhibition to read history at Somerville College, Oxford. While at Oxford, Kenyon won a Blue in hockey and became the first female president of the Oxford University Archaeological Society. She graduated in 1928 with a third class degree and began a career in archaeology the following year.

Although working on several important sites across Europe, it was her excavations in Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the 1950s that established her as one of the foremost archaeologists in the field. In 1962, Kenyon was made Principal of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. She retired in 1973 to Erbistock and was appointed a DBE. Kenyon never married. From 1974, Kenyon was the honorary vice president of the Chester Archaeological Society.

==Archaeological career==
A career in archaeology was first suggested to Kathleen by Margery Fry, librarian at Somerville College. After graduation Kenyon&#x27;s first field experience was as a photographer for the pioneering excavations at Great Zimbabwe in 1929, led by Gertrude Caton Thompson. 

Returning to England, Kenyon joined the archaeologist couple Tessa Wheeler and her husband Mortimer Wheeler on their excavation of the Romano-British settlement of Verulamium (St Albans), 20 miles North of London. Working there each summer between 1930 and 1935, Kenyon learned from Mortimer Wheeler the discipline of meticulously controlled and recorded stratigraphic excavation. Wheeler entrusted her with the direction of the excavation of the Roman theatre.

In the years 1931 to 1934, Kenyon worked simultaneously at Samaria, then under the administration of the British Mandate for Palestine, with John and Grace Crowfoot. There she cut a stratigraphic trench across the summit of the mound and down the Northern and Southern slopes, exposing the Iron II to the Roman period stratigraphic sequence of the site. In addition to providing crucial dating material for the Iron Age stratigraphy of Palestine, she obtained key stratified data for the study of late Hellenistic and early Roman eastern &quot;terra sigilata&quot; wares. In 1957, Kenyon introduced categories A, B, C, to classify eastern &quot;sigillata&quot; but without determining the exact place of manufacture. In 1934, Kenyon was closely associated with the Wheelers in the foundation of the Institute of Archaeology of University College London. 

In the years leading up to the Second World War work in the Middle East became increasingly difficult, so, from 1936 to 1939, she carried out important excavations at the Jewry Wall in Leicester. The excavations were published in February 1937 in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; with pioneering reconstruction drawings by the artist Alan Sorrell whom she had happened to notice sketching her dig. Kenyon initially thought the overall Jewry Wall site was that of the town forum. Although she modified her views when she uncovered the remains of the baths, she continued to believe that the area had originally been laid out as the forum, with the Jewry Wall the west wall of the basilica, but argued that in a second phase of building the site had been converted to public baths. In a series of excavations undertaken between 1961 and 1972, the true remains of the forum were identified further east. The Jewry Wall was then identified as the wall of the &quot;palaestra&quot; (gymnasium) of the baths complex.

===Digging Jericho===

During the Second World War, Kenyon served as Divisional Commander of the British Red Cross in Hammersmith, London, and later as acting director and secretary of the Institute of Archaeology of the University of London.

After the war, she excavated in Southwark, at The Wrekin, Shropshire, and elsewhere in Britain, as well as at Sabratha, a Roman city in Libya. As a member of the Council of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (BSAJ), Kenyon was involved in the efforts to reopen the School after the hiatus of the Second World War. In January 1951 she travelled to Transjordan and undertook excavations in the West Bank at Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) on behalf of the BSAJ. The initial findings were first viewed by the public in the Dome of Discovery at the Festival of Britain 1951 with a reconstruction drawing by Alan Sorrell. Her work at Jericho, from 1952 until 1958, made her world-famous and established a lasting legacy in the archaeological methodology of the Levant. Ground-breaking discoveries concerning the Neolithic cultures of the Levant were made in this ancient settlement. Her excavation of the Early Bronze Age walled city and the external cemeteries of the end of the Early Bronze Age, together with her analysis of the stratified pottery of these periods established her as the leading authority on that period. Kenyon focused her attention on the absence of certain Cypriot pottery at City IV, arguing for an older destruction date than that of her predecessors. Jericho was recognised as the oldest continuously occupied settlement in history because of her discoveries. At the same time she also completed the publication of the excavations at Samaria. Her volume, &quot;Samaria Sebaste III: The Objects&quot;, appeared in 1957. Having completed her excavations at Tell es-Sultan in 1958, Kenyon excavated in Jerusalem from 1961 to 1967, concentrating on the &#x27;City of David&#x27; to the immediate south of the Temple Mount.

Although Kenyon had no doubt the sites she excavated were linked to the Old Testament narrative, she nevertheless drew attention to inconsistencies, concluding that Solomon&#x27;s &quot;stables&quot; at Megiddo were totally impractical for holding horses (1978:72), and that Jericho fell long before Joshua&#x27;s arrival (1978:35). Consequently, Kenyon&#x27;s work has been cited to support the minimalist school of Biblical archaeology.

===Legacy===

Kenyon&#x27;s legacy in the field of excavation technique and ceramic methodology is attested to by Larry G. Herr, one of the directors of the Madaba Plains Project. He attributes to her directly the first of the key events (after the advances made by William Foxwell Albright at Tell Beit Mirsim in the 1920s) that brought about our modern understanding of pottery in the southern Levant:

Herr detects Kenyon&#x27;s powerful indirect influence in the second event that promoted advance within ceramic methodology, namely:

Herr summarises the somewhat mixed nature of Kenyon&#x27;s legacy: for all the positive advances, there were also shortcomings:

From 1948 to 1962, she lectured in Levantine archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. Kenyon&#x27;s teaching complemented her excavations at Jericho and Jerusalem. In 1962, she was appointed Principal of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==Awards and commemoration==
In the 1973 New Year Honours, following her retirement from Oxford, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) &quot;for services to archaeology&quot;; she had received the CBE in the 1954 New Year Honours. She was an elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) and of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). She was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Independence by the King of Jordan in 1977.

The British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, amalgamated within the Council for British Research in the Levant (CBRL) in 1998, was officially renamed the Kenyon Institute on 10 July 2003 in honour of Kathleen Kenyon.

At St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, the Kenyon Building was constructed between 1964 and 1965 to provide student accommodation; designed by modern architect David Roberts, the building has already been given a heritage listing. In 2025, the University of Leicester announced that their first academic building to be named after a woman would be the Dame Kathleen Kenyon Building, housing its Schools of Archaeology and Ancient History and Museum Studies.

The Kathleen Kenyon Archaeology Collection, a collection of Kenyon&#x27;s books and papers purchased from her estate in 1984, is housed at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.

The finds from her excavations are held in a number of collections, including the British Museum, the British Institute for Libyan and Northern African Studies and the UCL Institute of Archaeology, while the bulk of archive material is located at the Manchester Museum.

<doc id="16821" wikidata="Q114112" url="?curid=16821" title="Callicrates">
<text>Callicrates or Kallikrates (; ) was an ancient Greek architect active in the middle of the fifth century BC. He and Ictinus were architects of the Parthenon (Plutarch, &quot;Pericles&quot;, 13). An inscription identifies him as the architect of &quot;the Temple of Nike&quot; on the Acropolis of Athens (IG I3 35). The temple in question is either the amphiprostyle Temple of Athena Nike now visible on the site or a small-scale predecessor (naiskos) whose remains were found in the later temple&#x27;s foundations. 

An inscription identifies Callicrates as one of the architects of the Classical circuit wall of the Acropolis (IG I3 45), and Plutarch further states (loc. cit.) that he was contracted to build the middle of three defensive walls linking Athens and Piraeus.

A crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honor.

<doc id="16822" wikidata="Q55502" url="?curid=16822" title="Kingdom of Jerusalem">
<text>The Kingdom of Jerusalem, also known as the Crusader Kingdom, was one of the Crusader states established in the Levant immediately after the First Crusade. It lasted for almost two hundred years, from the accession of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1099 until the fall of Acre in 1291. Its history is divided into two periods with a brief interruption in its existence, beginning with its collapse after the siege of Jerusalem in 1187 and its restoration after the Third Crusade in 1192.

The original Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted from 1099 to 1187 before being almost entirely overrun by the Ayyubid Sultanate under Saladin. Following the Third Crusade, it was re-established in Acre in 1192. The re-established state is commonly known as the &quot;Second Kingdom of Jerusalem&quot; or, alternatively, as the &quot;Kingdom of Acre&quot; after its new capital city. Acre remained the capital for the rest of its existence, even during the two decades that followed the Crusaders&#x27; establishment of partial control over Jerusalem during the Sixth Crusade, through the diplomacy of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen vis-à-vis the Ayyubids.

The vast majority of the Crusaders who established and settled the Kingdom of Jerusalem were from the Kingdom of France, as were the knights and soldiers who made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of its existence; its rulers and elite were therefore predominantly French. French Crusaders also brought their language to the Levant, thus establishing Old French as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Crusader states, in which Latin served as the official language. While the majority of the population in the countryside comprised Christians and Muslims from local Levantine ethnicities, many Europeans (primarily French and Italian) also arrived to settle in villages across the region.

== Geographic boundaries ==

At first the kingdom was little more than a loose collection of towns and cities captured during the First Crusade, but at its height in the mid-12th century, the kingdom encompassed roughly the territory of modern-day Israel, Palestine, and the southern parts of Lebanon. From the Mediterranean Sea, the kingdom extended in a thin strip of land from Beirut in the north to the Sinai Desert in the south; into modern Jordan and Syria in the east, and towards Fatimid Egypt in the west. Three other Crusader states founded during and after the First Crusade were located further north: the County of Edessa (1097–1144), the Principality of Antioch (1098–1268), and the County of Tripoli (1109–1289). While all three were independent, they were closely tied to Jerusalem. Beyond these to the north and west lay the states of Armenian Cilicia and the Byzantine Empire, with which Jerusalem had a close relationship in the twelfth century. Further east, various Muslim emirates were located which were ultimately allied with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. The kingdom was ruled by King Aimery of Lusignan (1197–1205), the King of Cyprus, another crusader state founded during the Third Crusade. Dynastic ties also strengthened with Tripoli, Antioch, and Armenia. The kingdom was soon increasingly dominated by the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (reigned 1220–1250) had ambitions in the Crusader state, claiming the kingdom by marriage, but his presence sparked a civil war (1228–1243) among the kingdom&#x27;s nobility. The kingdom became little more than a pawn in the politics and warfare of the Ayyubid and Mamluk dynasties in Egypt, as well as the Khwarezmian and Mongol invaders. As a relatively minor kingdom, it received little financial or military support from Europe; despite numerous small expeditions, Europeans generally proved unwilling to undertake an expensive journey to the east for an apparently losing cause. The Mamluk sultans Baibars (reigned 1260–1277) and al-Ashraf Khalil (reigned 1290–1293) eventually reconquered all the remaining crusader strongholds, culminating in the destruction of Acre in 1291.

== People ==
The kingdom was ethnically, religiously, and linguistically diverse, although the Crusaders established themselves and their descendants as an elite Catholic minority. They imported many customs and institutions from their homelands in Europe, and there were close familial and political connections with the West throughout the kingdom&#x27;s existence. The kingdom also inherited &quot;oriental&quot; qualities, influenced by pre-existing customs and populations. The majority of the kingdom&#x27;s inhabitants were native Christians, especially Greek and Syriac Orthodox, as well as Sunni and Shi&#x27;a Muslims. The native Christians and Muslims, who were a marginalized lower class, tended to speak Greek and Arabic, while the crusaders, who came mainly from France, spoke French. There were also a small number of Jews and Samaritans.

According to Benjamin of Tudela, who travelled through the kingdom around 1170, there were 1,000 Samaritans in Nablus, 200 in Caesarea and 300 in Ascalon. This sets a lower bound for the Samaritan population at 1,500, since the contemporary &quot;Tolidah&quot;, a Samaritan chronicle, also mentions communities in Gaza and Acre. Benjamin of Tudela estimated the total Jewish population of 14 cities in the kingdom to be 1,200, making the Samaritan population of the time larger than the Jewish, perhaps for the only time in history.

== History ==
=== First Crusade and the foundation of the kingdom ===

The First Crusade was preached at the Council of Clermont in 1095 by Pope Urban II, with the goal of assisting the Byzantine Empire against the invasions of the &quot;Turks and Arabs&quot; and &quot;to destroy this vile race from the lands of our friends.&quot; However, the main objective quickly became the control of the Holy Land. The Byzantines were frequently at war with the Seljuks and other Turkish dynasties for control of Anatolia and Syria. The Sunni Seljuks had formerly ruled the Seljuk Empire, but this empire had collapsed into several smaller states after the death of Malik-Shah I in 1092. Malik-Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian Sultanate of Rum by Kilij Arslan I, and in Syria by his brother Tutush I, who died in 1095. Tutush&#x27;s sons Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan and Duqaq inherited Aleppo and Damascus respectively, further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other, as well as Kerbogha, the atabeg of Mosul. This disunity among the Anatolian and Syrian emirs allowed the Crusaders to overcome any military opposition they faced on the way to Jerusalem.

Egypt and much of Palestine were controlled by the Arab Shi&#x27;ite Fatimid Caliphate, which had extended further into Syria before the arrival of the Seljuks. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuks caused great disruption for the local Christians and for Western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of caliph al-Musta&#x27;li but actually controlled by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuks in 1073; they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids, a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuks, just before the arrival of the crusaders.
The Crusaders arrived at Jerusalem in June 1099; a few of the neighbouring towns (Ramla, Lydda, Bethlehem, and others) were taken first, and Jerusalem itself was captured on July 15. On 22 July, a council was held in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to establish a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse and Godfrey of Bouillon were recognized as the leaders of the crusade and the siege of Jerusalem. Raymond was the wealthier and more powerful of the two, but at first he refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety and probably hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway. The more popular Godfrey did not hesitate like Raymond, and accepted the position as leader. Most modern historians chronicle that he took the title &quot;Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri&quot; (&quot;advocate&quot; or &quot;defender&quot; of the Holy Sepulchre). Others report that Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term &quot;princeps&quot;, or simply retained his title of &quot;dux&quot; from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey had become a legendary hero, he refused to wear &quot;a crown of gold&quot; where Christ had worn &quot;a crown of thorns&quot;. Raymond was incensed and took his army to forage away from the city. The new kingdom, and Godfrey&#x27;s reputation, was secured with the defeat of the Fatimid Egyptian army under al-Afdal Shahanshah at the Battle of Ascalon one month after the conquest, on August 12, but Raymond and Godfrey&#x27;s continued antagonism prevented the crusaders from taking control of Ascalon itself.

There was still some uncertainty about what to do with the new kingdom. The papal legate Daimbert of Pisa convinced Godfrey to hand over Jerusalem to him as Latin patriarch, with the intention to set up a theocratic state directly under papal control. According to William of Tyre, Godfrey may have supported Daimbert&#x27;s efforts, and he agreed to take possession of if Daimbert were permitted to rule Jerusalem. Godfrey did indeed increase the boundaries of the kingdom, by capturing Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias, and other cities, and reducing many others to tributary status. He set the foundations for the system of vassalage in the kingdom, establishing the Principality of Galilee and the County of Jaffa, but his reign was short, and he died of an illness in 1100. His brother Baldwin of Boulogne successfully outmanoeuvred Daimbert and claimed Jerusalem for himself as &quot;King of the Latins of Jerusalem&quot;. Daimbert compromised by crowning Baldwin I in Bethlehem rather than Jerusalem, but the path for a monarchy had been laid. Within this framework, a Catholic church hierarchy was established, overtop of the local Eastern Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox authorities, who retained their own hierarchies (the Catholics considered them schismatics and thus illegitimate, and vice versa). Under the Latin patriarch, there were four suffragan archdioceses and numerous dioceses.

=== Expansion ===
During Baldwin I&#x27;s reign, the kingdom expanded even further. The number of European inhabitants increased, as the minor crusade of 1101 brought reinforcements to the kingdom. Baldwin repopulated Jerusalem with Franks and native Christians, after his expedition across the Jordan in 1115. With help from the Italian city-states and other adventurers, notably King Sigurd I of Norway, Baldwin captured the port cities of Acre (1104), Beirut (1110), and Sidon (1111), while exerting his suzerainty over the other crusader states to the north – Edessa (which he had founded in 1097 during the crusade), Antioch, and Tripoli, which he helped capture in 1109. He successfully defended against Muslim invasions, from the Fatimids at the numerous battles at Ramla and elsewhere in the southwest of the kingdom, and from Damascus and Mosul at the Battle of al-Sannabra in the northeast in 1113. As Thomas Madden says, Baldwin was , who 

Baldwin brought with him an Armenian wife, traditionally named Arda (although never named such by contemporaries), whom he had married to gain political support from the Armenian population in Edessa, and whom he quickly set aside when he no longer needed Armenian support in Jerusalem. He bigamously married Adelaide del Vasto, regent of Sicily, in 1113, but was convinced to divorce her as well in 1117; Adelaide&#x27;s son from her first marriage, Roger II of Sicily, never forgave Jerusalem, and for decades withheld much-needed Sicilian naval support.

Baldwin died without heirs in 1118, during a campaign against Egypt, and the kingdom was offered to his brother Eustace III of Boulogne, who had accompanied Baldwin and Godfrey on the crusade. Eustace was uninterested, and instead the crown passed to Baldwin&#x27;s relative, probably a cousin, Baldwin of Le Bourg, who had previously succeeded him in Edessa. Baldwin II was an able ruler, and he too successfully defended against Fatimid and Seljuk invasions. Although Antioch was severely weakened after the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119, and Baldwin himself was held captive by the emir of Aleppo from 1123 to 1124, Baldwin led the crusader states to victory at the Battle of Azaz in 1125. His reign saw the establishment of the first military orders, the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar; the earliest surviving written laws of the kingdom, compiled at the Council of Nablus in 1120; and the first commercial treaty with the Republic of Venice, the , in 1124. The increase of naval and military support from Venice led to the capture of Tyre that year. The influence of Jerusalem was further extended over Edessa and Antioch, where Baldwin II acted as regent when their own leaders were killed in battle, although there were regency governments in Jerusalem as well during Baldwin&#x27;s captivity. Baldwin was married to the Armenian noblewoman Morphia of Melitene, and had four daughters: Hodierna and Alice, who married into the families of the Count of Tripoli and Prince of Antioch; Ioveta, who became an influential abbess; and the eldest, Melisende, who was his heir and succeeded him upon his death in 1131, with her husband Fulk V of Anjou as king-consort. Their son, the future Baldwin III, was named co-heir by his grandfather.

=== Edessa, Damascus, and the Second Crusade ===
Fulk was an experienced crusader and had brought military support to the kingdom during a pilgrimage in 1120. He brought Jerusalem into the sphere of the Angevin Empire, as the father of Geoffrey V of Anjou and grandfather of the future Henry II of England. Not everyone appreciated the imposition of a foreigner as king. In 1132 Antioch, Tripoli, and Edessa all asserted their independence and conspired to prevent Fulk from exercising the suzerainty of Jerusalem over them. He defeated Tripoli in battle, and settled the regency in Antioch by arranging a marriage between the countess, Melisende&#x27;s niece Constance, and his own relative Raymond of Poitiers. Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, the native crusader nobles opposed Fulk&#x27;s preference for his Angevin retinue. In 1134 Hugh II of Jaffa revolted against Fulk, allying with the Muslim garrison at Ascalon, for which he was convicted of treason . The Latin patriarch intervened to settle the dispute, but an assassination attempt was then made on Hugh, for which Fulk was blamed. This scandal allowed Melisende and her supporters to gain control of the government, just as her father had intended. Accordingly, Fulk 

Fulk was then faced with a new and more dangerous enemy: the atabeg Zengi of Mosul, who had taken control of Aleppo and had set his sights on Damascus as well; the union of these three states would have been a serious blow to the growing power of Jerusalem. A brief intervention in 1137–1138 by the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus, who wished to assert imperial suzerainty over all the crusader states, did nothing to stop the threat of Zengi; in 1139 Damascus and Jerusalem recognized the severity of the threat to both states, and an alliance was concluded which halted Zengi&#x27;s advance. Fulk used this time to construct numerous castles, including Ibelin and Kerak. After the death of both Fulk and Emperor John in separate hunting accidents in 1143, Zengi invaded and conquered Edessa in 1144. Queen Melisende, now regent for her elder son Baldwin III, appointed a new constable, Manasses of Hierges, to head the army after Fulk&#x27;s death, but Edessa could not be recaptured, despite Zengi&#x27;s own assassination in 1146. The fall of Edessa shocked Europe, and a Second Crusade arrived in 1148.

After meeting in Acre in June, the crusading kings Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany agreed with Melisende, Baldwin III and the major nobles of the kingdom to attack Damascus. Zengi&#x27;s territory had been divided amongst his sons after his death, and Damascus no longer felt threatened, so an alliance had been made with Zengi&#x27;s son Nur ad-Din, the emir of Aleppo. Perhaps remembering attacks launched on Jerusalem from Damascus in previous decades, Damascus seemed to be the best target for the crusade, rather than Aleppo or another city to the north which would have allowed for the recapture of Edessa. The subsequent Siege of Damascus was a complete failure; when the city seemed to be on the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls, and was driven back. The Crusaders retreated within three days. There were rumours of treachery and bribery, and Conrad III felt betrayed by the nobility of Jerusalem. Whatever the reason for the failure, the French and German armies returned home, and a few years later Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din&#x27;s control.

=== Civil war ===
The failure of the Second Crusade had dire long-term consequences for the kingdom. The West was hesitant to send large-scale expeditions; for the next few decades, only small armies came, headed by minor European nobles who desired to make a pilgrimage. The Muslim states of Syria were meanwhile gradually united by Nur ad-Din, who defeated the Principality of Antioch at the Battle of Inab in 1149 and gained control of Damascus in 1154. Nur ad-Din was extremely pious and during his rule the concept of jihad came to be interpreted as a kind of counter-crusade against the kingdom, which was an impediment to Muslim unity, both political and spiritual.
In Jerusalem, the Crusaders were distracted by a conflict between Melisende and Baldwin III. Melisende continued to rule as regent long after Baldwin came of age. She was supported by, among others, Manasses of Hierges, who essentially governed for her as constable; her son Amalric, whom she set up as Count of Jaffa; Philip of Milly; and the Ibelin family. Baldwin asserted his independence by mediating disputes in Antioch and Tripoli, and gained the support of the Ibelin brothers when they began to oppose Manasses&#x27; growing power, thanks to his marriage to their widowed mother Helvis of Ramla. In 1153 Baldwin had himself crowned as sole ruler, and a compromise was reached by which the kingdom was divided in two, with Baldwin taking Acre and Tyre in the north and Melisende remaining in control of Jerusalem and the cities of the south. Baldwin was able to replace Manasses with one of his own supporters, Humphrey II of Toron. Baldwin and Melisende knew that this situation was untenable. Baldwin soon invaded his mother&#x27;s possessions, defeated Manasses, and besieged his mother in the Tower of David in Jerusalem. Melisende surrendered and retired to Nablus, but Baldwin appointed her his regent and chief advisor, and she retained some of her influence, especially in appointing ecclesiastical officials. In 1153, Baldwin launched an offensive against Ascalon, the fortress in the south from which Fatimid Egyptian armies had continually raided Jerusalem since the foundation of the kingdom. The fortress was captured and was added to the County of Jaffa, still in the possession of his brother Amalric.

=== Byzantine alliance and invasion of Egypt ===

With the capture of Ascalon the southern border of the kingdom was now secure, and Egypt, formerly a major threat to the kingdom but now destabilized under the reign of several underaged caliphs, was reduced to a tributary state. Nur ad-Din remained a threat in the east, and Baldwin had to contend with the advances of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, who claimed suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch. In order to bolster the defences of the kingdom against the growing strength of the Muslims, Baldwin III made the first direct alliance with the Byzantine Empire, by marrying Theodora Comnena, a niece of emperor Manuel; Manuel married Baldwin&#x27;s cousin Maria. As William of Tyre put it, it was hoped that Manuel would be able &quot;to relieve from his own abundance the distress under which our realm was suffering and to change our poverty into superabundance&quot;.

The relationship between Byzantium and Jerusalem has divided historians, with some historians supporting the Byzantine interpretation that Amalric recognised Manuel as his overlord, while other scholars such as Andrew Jotischky see the relationship as one of Byzantine protection of Orthodox Christians in Jerusalem.

When Baldwin died childless in 1162, a year after his mother Melisende, the kingdom passed to his brother Amalric, who renewed the alliance negotiated by Baldwin. In 1163 the chaotic situation in Egypt led to a refusal to pay tribute to Jerusalem, and requests were sent to Nur ad-Din for assistance; in response, Amalric invaded, but was turned back when the Egyptians flooded the Nile at Bilbeis. The Egyptian vizier Shawar again requested help from Nur ad-Din, who sent his general Shirkuh, but Shawar quickly turned against him and allied with Amalric. Amalric and Shirkuh both besieged Bilbeis in 1164, but both withdrew due to Nur ad-Din&#x27;s campaigns against Antioch, where Bohemond III of Antioch and Raymond III of Tripoli were defeated at the Battle of Harim. It seemed likely that Antioch itself would fall to Nur ad-Din, but he withdrew when Emperor Manuel sent a large Byzantine force to the area. Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt in 1166, and Shawar again allied with Amalric, who was defeated at the Battle of al-Babein. Despite the defeat, both sides withdrew, but Shawar remained in control with a crusader garrison in Cairo. Amalric cemented his alliance with Manuel by marrying Manuel&#x27;s niece Maria Komnene in 1167, and an embassy led by William of Tyre was sent to Constantinople to negotiate a military expedition, but in 1168 Amalric pillaged Bilbeis without waiting for the naval support promised by Manuel. Amalric accomplished nothing else, but his actions prompted Shawar to switch sides again and seek help from Shirkuh. Shawar was promptly assassinated, and when Shirkuh died in 1169, he was succeeded by his nephew Yusuf, better known as Saladin. That year, Manuel sent a large Byzantine fleet of some 300 ships to assist Amalric, and the town of Damietta was placed under siege. However, the Byzantine fleet sailed with enough provisions for only three months. By the time the Crusaders were ready, supplies were already running out and the fleet retired. Each side sought to blame the other for the failure, but both knew that they could not take Egypt without the other&#x27;s assistance: the alliance was maintained, and plans for another campaign in Egypt were made, which ultimately were to come to nought.

In the end, Nur ad-Din was victorious and Saladin established himself as Sultan of Egypt. Saladin soon began to assert his independence from Nur ad-Din, and with the death of both Amalric and Nur ad-Din in 1174, he was well-placed to begin exerting control over Nur ad-Din&#x27;s Syrian possessions as well. Upon the death of the pro-western Emperor Manuel in 1180, the Kingdom of Jerusalem lost its most powerful ally.

The subsequent events have often been interpreted as a struggle between two opposing factions, the &quot;court party&quot;, made up of Baldwin&#x27;s mother, Amalric&#x27;s first wife Agnes of Courtenay, her immediate family, and recent arrivals from Europe who were inexperienced in the affairs of the kingdom and who were in favour of war with Saladin; and the &quot;noble party&quot;, led by Raymond of Tripoli and the lesser nobility of the kingdom, who favoured peaceful co-existence with the Muslims. This is the interpretation offered by William of Tyre, who was firmly placed in the &quot;noble&quot; camp, and his view was taken up by subsequent historians; in the 20th century, Marshall W. Baldwin, Steven Runciman, and Hans E. Mayer favoured this interpretation. Peter W. Edbury, on the other hand, argues that William, as well as the thirteenth-century authors who continued William&#x27;s chronicle in French and were allied to Raymond&#x27;s supporters in the Ibelin family, cannot be considered impartial. Although the events were clearly a dynastic struggle, 

Miles of Plancy was briefly &quot;bailli&quot; or regent during Baldwin IV&#x27;s minority. Miles was assassinated in October 1174, and Count Raymond III of Tripoli, Amalric&#x27;s first cousin, became regent. It is highly probable that Raymond or his supporters engineered the assassination. Baldwin reached his majority in 1176, and despite his illness he no longer had any legal need for a regent. Since Raymond was his nearest relative in the male line with a strong claim to the throne, there was concern about the extent of his ambitions, although he had no direct heirs of his own. To balance this, the king turned from time to time to his uncle, Joscelin III of Edessa, who was appointed seneschal in 1176; Joscelin was more closely related to Baldwin than Raymond was, but had no claim to the throne himself.

As a leper, Baldwin had no children and could not be expected to rule much longer, so the focus of his succession passed to his sister Sibylla and his younger half-sister Isabella. Baldwin and his advisors recognised that it was essential for Sibylla to be married to a Western nobleman in order to access support from European states in a military crisis; while Raymond was still regent, a marriage was arranged for Sibylla and William of Montferrat, a cousin of Louis VII of France and of Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor. It was hoped that by allying with a relative of the Western emperor, Frederick would come to the kingdom&#x27;s aid. Jerusalem looked again towards the Byzantine Empire for help, and Emperor Manuel was looking for a way to restore his empire&#x27;s prestige after his defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176; this mission was undertaken by Raynald of Châtillon. After William of Montferrat arrived in 1176, he fell ill and died in June 1177, leaving Sibylla widowed and pregnant with the future Baldwin V. Raynald was then named regent.
Soon afterwards, Philip of Flanders arrived in Jerusalem on pilgrimage; he was Baldwin IV&#x27;s cousin, and the king offered him the regency and command of the army, both of which Philip refused, although he objected to the appointment of Raynald as regent. Philip then attempted to intervene in the negotiations for Sibylla&#x27;s second husband, and suggested one of his own retinue, but the native barons refused his suggestion. In addition, Philip seemed to think he could carve out a territory of his own in Egypt, but he refused to participate in the planned Byzantine-Jerusalem expedition. The expedition was delayed and finally cancelled, and Philip took his army away to the north.

Most of the army of Jerusalem marched north with Philip, Raymond III, and Bohemond III to attack Hama, and Saladin took the opportunity to invade the kingdom. Baldwin proved to be an effective and energetic king as well as a brilliant military commander: he defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard in September 1177 despite being greatly outnumbered and having to rely on a levee-en-masse. Although Baldwin&#x27;s presence despite his illness was inspirational, direct military decisions were actually made by Raynald.

Hugh III of Burgundy was expected to come to Jerusalem and marry Sibylla, but Hugh was unable to leave France due to the political unrest there in 1179–1180 following the death of Louis VII. Meanwhile, Baldwin IV&#x27;s stepmother Maria, mother of Isabella and stepmother of Sibylla, married Balian of Ibelin. At Easter in 1180, Raymond and his cousin Bohemond III of Antioch attempted to force Sibylla to marry Balian&#x27;s brother Baldwin of Ibelin. Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin&#x27;s nearest male relatives in the paternal line, and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement. Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived, Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla to be married to a Poitevin newcomer, Guy of Lusignan, whose older brother Amalric of Lusignan was already an established figure at court. Internationally, the Lusignans were useful as vassals of Baldwin and Sibylla&#x27;s cousin Henry II of England. Baldwin betrothed eight-year-old Isabella to Humphrey IV of Toron, stepson of the powerful Raynald of Châtillon, thereby removing her from the influence of the Ibelin family and that of her mother.

The dispute between the two factions in the kingdom affected the election of a new Patriarch in 1180. When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180, the two most obvious choices for his successor were William of Tyre and Heraclius of Caesarea. They were fairly evenly matched in background and education, but politically they were allied with opposite parties, as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay&#x27;s supporters. The canons of the Holy Sepulchre asked the king for advice, and Heraclius was chosen through Agnes&#x27; influence. There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers, but this information comes from the partisan 13th-century continuations of William of Tyre&#x27;s history, and there is no other evidence to substantiate such a claim.

At the end of 1181, Raynald of Châtillon raided south into Arabia, in the direction of Medina, although he did not make it that far. It was probably around this time that Raynald also attacked a Muslim caravan. The kingdom had a truce with Saladin at the time, and Raynald&#x27;s actions have been seen as an independent act of brigandage; it is possible that he was trying to prevent Saladin from moving his forces north to take control of Aleppo, which would have strengthened Saladin&#x27;s position. In response, Saladin attacked the kingdom in 1182, but was defeated at Belvoir Castle. King Baldwin, although quite ill, was still able to command the army in person. Saladin attempted to besiege Beirut from land and sea, and Baldwin raided Damascene territory, but neither side did significant damage. In December 1182, Raynald launched a naval expedition on the Red Sea, which made it as far south as Rabigh. The expedition was defeated and two of Raynald&#x27;s men were actually taken to Mecca to be executed in public. Like his earlier raids, Raynald&#x27;s expedition is usually seen as selfish and ultimately fatal for Jerusalem, but according to Bernard Hamilton, it was actually a shrewd strategy, meant to damage Saladin&#x27;s prestige and reputation.

In 1183 a general tax was levied throughout the kingdom, which was unprecedented in Jerusalem and almost all of medieval Europe to that point. The tax helped pay for larger armies for the next few years. More troops were certainly needed, since Saladin was finally able to gain control of Aleppo, and with peace in his northern territories, he could focus on Jerusalem in the south. King Baldwin was so incapacitated by his leprosy that it was necessary to appoint a regent, and Guy of Lusignan was chosen, as he was Baldwin&#x27;s legal heir and the king was not expected to live. The inexperienced Guy led the Frankish army against Saladin&#x27;s incursions into the kingdom, but neither side made any real gains, and Guy was criticized by his opponents for not striking against Saladin when he had the chance.

In October 1183, Isabella married Humphrey of Toron at Kerak during a siege by Saladin, who perhaps hoped to take some valuable prisoners. As King Baldwin, although now blind and crippled, had recovered enough to resume his reign and his command of the army, Guy was removed from the regency and his five-year-old stepson, King Baldwin&#x27;s nephew and namesake Baldwin, was crowned as co-king in November. King Baldwin himself then went to relieve the castle, carried on a litter, and attended by his mother. He was reconciled with Raymond of Tripoli and appointed him military commander. The siege was lifted in December and Saladin retreated to Damascus. Saladin attempted another siege in 1184, but Baldwin repelled that attack as well, and Saladin raided Nablus and other towns on the way home.

In October 1184, Guy of Lusignan led an attack on the Bedouin nomads from his base in Ascalon. Unlike Raynald&#x27;s attacks on caravans, which may have had some military purpose, Guy attacked a group that was usually loyal to Jerusalem and provided intelligence about the movements of Saladin&#x27;s troops. At the same time, King Baldwin contracted his final illness and Raymond of Tripoli, rather than Guy, was appointed as his regent. His nephew Baldwin was paraded in public, wearing his crown as Baldwin V. Baldwin IV finally succumbed to his leprosy in May 1185.

Meanwhile, the succession crisis had prompted a mission to the West to seek assistance. In 1184, Patriarch Heraclius travelled throughout the courts of Europe, but no help was forthcoming. Heraclius offered the , but not the crown itself, to both Philip II of France and Henry II of England; the latter, as a grandson of Fulk, was a first cousin of the royal family of Jerusalem, and had promised to go on crusade after the murder of Thomas Becket. Both kings preferred to remain at home to defend their own territories, rather than act as regent for a child in Jerusalem. The few European knights who did travel to Jerusalem did not even see any combat, since the truce with Saladin had been re-established. William V of Montferrat was one of the few who came to his grandson Baldwin V&#x27;s aid.
Baldwin V&#x27;s rule, with Raymond of Tripoli as regent and his great-uncle Joscelin of Edessa as his guardian, was short. He was a sickly child and died in the summer of 1186. Raymond and his supporters went to Nablus, presumably in an attempt to prevent Sibylla from claiming the throne, but Sibylla and her supporters went to Jerusalem, where it was decided that the kingdom should pass to her, on the condition that her marriage to Guy be annulled. She agreed but only if she could choose her own husband and king, and after being crowned, she immediately crowned Guy with her own hands. Raymond had refused to attend the coronation, and in Nablus he suggested that Isabella and Humphrey should be crowned instead, but Humphrey refused to agree to this plan which would have certainly started a civil war. Humphrey went to Jerusalem and swore allegiance to Guy and Sibylla, as did most of Raymond&#x27;s other supporters. Raymond himself refused to do so and left for Tripoli; Baldwin of Ibelin also refused, gave up his fiefs, and left for Antioch.

=== Loss of Jerusalem and the Third Crusade ===

Raymond of Tripoli allied with Saladin against Guy and allowed a Muslim garrison to occupy his fief in Tiberias, probably hoping that Saladin would help him overthrow Guy. Saladin, meanwhile, had pacified his Mesopotamian territories, and was now eager to attack the crusader kingdom; he did not intend to renew the truce when it expired in 1187. Before the truce expired, Raynald of Chatillon, the lord of Oultrejourdain and of Kerak and one of Guy&#x27;s chief supporters, recognized that Saladin was massing his troops, and attacked Muslim caravans in an attempt to disrupt this. Guy was on the verge of attacking Raymond, but realized that the kingdom would need to be united in the face of the threat from Saladin, and Balian of Ibelin effected a reconciliation between the two during Easter in 1187. Saladin attacked Kerak again in April, and in May, a Muslim raiding party ran into the much smaller embassy on its way to negotiate with Raymond, and defeated it at the Battle of Cresson near Nazareth. Raymond and Guy finally agreed to attack Saladin at Tiberias, but could not agree on a plan; Raymond thought a pitched battle should be avoided, but Guy probably remembered the criticism he faced for avoiding battle in 1183, and it was decided to march out against Saladin directly. On 4 July 1187, the army of the kingdom was utterly destroyed at the Battle of Hattin. Raymond of Tripoli, Balian of Ibelin, and Reginald of Sidon escaped, but Raynald was executed by Saladin and Guy was imprisoned in Damascus.

Over the next few months, Saladin easily overran the entire kingdom. Only the port of Tyre remained in Frankish hands, defended by Conrad of Montferrat, who had coincidentally arrived just in time from Constantinople. The fall of Jerusalem essentially ended the first Kingdom of Jerusalem. Much of the population, swollen with refugees fleeing Saladin&#x27;s conquest of the surrounding territory, was allowed to flee to Tyre, Tripoli, or Egypt (whence they were sent back to Europe), but those who could not pay for their freedom were sold into slavery, and those who could were often robbed by Christians and Muslims alike on their way into exile. The capture of the city led to the Third Crusade, launched in 1189 and led by Richard the Lionheart, Philip Augustus and Frederick Barbarossa, though the last drowned en route.

Guy of Lusignan, who had been refused entry to Tyre by Conrad, began to besiege Acre in 1189. During the lengthy siege, which lasted until 1191, Patriarch Heraclius, Queen Sibylla and her daughters, and many others died of disease. With the death of Sibylla in 1190, Guy now had no legal claim to the kingship, and the succession passed to Sibylla&#x27;s half-sister Isabella. Isabella&#x27;s mother Maria and the Ibelins (now closely allied to Conrad) argued that Isabella and Humphrey&#x27;s marriage was illegal, as she had been underage at the time; underlying this was the fact that Humphrey had betrayed his wife&#x27;s cause in 1186. The marriage was annulled amid some controversy. Conrad, who was now the nearest kinsman to Baldwin V in the male line, and had already proved himself a capable military leader, then married Isabella, but Guy refused to concede the crown.

When Richard arrived in 1191, he and Philip took different sides in the succession dispute. Richard backed Guy, his vassal from Poitou, while Philip supported Conrad, a cousin of his late father Louis VII. After much ill feeling and ill health, Philip returned home in 1191, soon after the fall of Acre. Richard defeated Saladin at the Battle of Arsuf in 1191 and the Battle of Jaffa in 1192, recovering most of the coast, but could not recover Jerusalem or any of the inland territory of the kingdom. It has been suggested that this may have actually been a strategic decision by Richard rather than a failure as such, as he may have recognized that Jerusalem, in particular, was in fact a strategic liability as long as the Crusaders were obligated to defend it, as it was isolated from the sea where Western reinforcements could arrive. Conrad was unanimously elected king in April 1192, but was murdered by the Hashshashin only days later. Eight days after that, the pregnant Isabella was married to Count Henry II of Champagne, nephew of Richard and Philip, but politically allied to Richard. As compensation, Richard sold Guy the island of Cyprus, which Richard had captured on the way to Acre, although Guy continued to claim the throne of Jerusalem until his death in 1194.

The crusade came to an end peacefully, with the Treaty of Ramla negotiated in 1192; Saladin allowed pilgrimages to be made to Jerusalem, allowing the crusaders to fulfil their vows, after which they all returned home. The native crusader barons set about rebuilding their kingdom from Acre and the other coastal cities.

=== The Kingdom of Acre ===
For the next hundred years, the Kingdom of Jerusalem remained a tiny kingdom hugging the Syrian coastline. Its capital was moved to Acre and controlled most of the coastline of present-day Israel and southern and central Lebanon, including the strongholds and towns of Jaffa, Arsuf, Caesarea, Tyre, Sidon, and Beirut. At best, it included only a few other significant cities, such as Ascalon and some interior fortresses, as well as suzerainty over Tripoli and Antioch. The new king, Henry of Champagne, died accidentally in 1197, and Isabella married for a fourth time, to Aimery of Lusignan, Guy&#x27;s brother. Aimery had already inherited Cyprus from Guy, and had been crowned king by Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s son, Emperor Henry VI. Henry led a crusade in 1197 but died along the way. Nevertheless, his troops recaptured Beirut and Sidon for the kingdom before returning home in 1198. A five-year truce was then concluded with the Ayyubids in Syria in 1198.

The Ayyubid empire had fallen into civil war after the death of Saladin in 1193. His sons claimed various parts of his empire: az-Zahir took control of Aleppo, al-Aziz Uthman held Cairo, while his eldest son, al-Afdal, retained Damascus. Saladin&#x27;s brother Al-Adil Sayf ad-Din (often called &quot;Saphadin&quot; by the Crusaders) acquired al-Jazira (northern Mesopotamia), and al-Adil&#x27;s son al-Mu&#x27;azzam took possession of Karak and Transjordan. In 1196, al-Afdal was driven out of Damascus by al Adil in alliance with Uthman. When Uthman died in 1198, al Afdal returned to power as regent in Egypt for Uthman&#x27;s infant son. Allied with az-Zahir, he then attacked his uncle in Damascus. The alliance fell apart, and al-Adil then defeated al Afdal in Egypt and annexed the country. In 1200 Al-Adil proclaimed himself Sultan of Egypt and Syria, entrusting Damascus to al-Mu&#x27;azzam and al-Jazira to another son, al-Kamil. Following a second unsuccessful siege of Damascus by the two brothers, Al Afdal accepted a fief consisting of Samosata and a number of other towns. Az-Zahir of Aleppo submitted to his uncle in 1202, thus re-uniting the Ayyubid territories.

Meanwhile, schemes were hatched to reconquer Jerusalem through Egypt. A Fourth Crusade was planned after the failure of the Third, but it resulted in the sack of Constantinople in 1204, and most of the crusaders involved never arrived in the kingdom. Aimery, however, not knowing of the diversion to Constantinople, raided Egypt in advance of the expected invasion. Both Isabella and Aimery died in 1205 and again an underage girl, Isabella and Conrad&#x27;s daughter Maria of Montferrat, became queen of Jerusalem. Isabella&#x27;s half-brother John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut governed as regent until 1210 when Maria married an experienced French knight, John of Brienne. Maria died in childbirth in 1212, and John of Brienne continued to rule as regent for their daughter Isabella II.

=== Fifth and Sixth Crusades and Frederick II ===

The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 called for a new, better-organized crusade against Egypt. In late 1217 King Andrew II of Hungary and Duke Leopold VI of Austria arrived in Acre and, along with John of Brienne, raided territory further inland, including Mount Tabor, but without success. After the departure of the Hungarians, the remaining Crusaders set about refortifying Caesarea and the Templar fortress of Château Pèlerin throughout the winter of 1217 and spring of 1218.

In the spring of 1218 the Fifth Crusade began in earnest when German crusader fleets landed at Acre. Along with King John, who was elected leader of the crusade, the fleets sailed to Egypt and besieged Damietta at the mouth of the Nile in May. The siege progressed slowly, and the Egyptian sultan al-Adil died in August 1218, supposedly of shock after the Crusaders managed to capture one of Damietta&#x27;s towers. He was succeeded by his son al-Kamil. In the autumn of 1218 reinforcements arrived from Europe, including the papal legate Pelagius of Albano. In the winter the crusaders were affected by floods and disease, and the siege dragged on throughout 1219, when Francis of Assisi arrived to attempt to negotiate a truce. Neither side could agree to terms, despite the Ayyubid offer of a thirty-year truce and the restoration of Jerusalem and most of the rest of the former kingdom. The Crusaders finally managed to starve out the city and captured it in November. Al-Kamil retreated to the nearby fortress of al-Mansurah, but the crusaders remained in Damietta throughout 1219 and 1220, awaiting the arrival of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, while King John returned to Acre briefly to defend against al-Mu&#x27;azzam, who was raiding the kingdom from Damascus in John&#x27;s absence. Still expecting the emperor&#x27;s imminent arrival, in July 1221, the Crusaders set off towards Cairo, but they were stopped by the rising Nile, which al-Kamil allowed to flood by breaking the dams along its course. The sultan easily defeated the trapped Crusader army and regained Damietta. Emperor Frederick had, in fact, never left Europe at all.

After the failure of the crusade, John travelled throughout Europe seeking assistance, but found support only from Frederick, who then married John and Maria&#x27;s daughter Isabella II in 1225. The next year, Isabella died giving birth to their son Conrad IV, who succeeded his mother to the throne although he never appeared in the East. Frederick had reneged on his promise to lead the Fifth Crusade, but was now eager to cement his claim to the throne through Conrad. There were also plans to join with al-Kamil in attacking al-Mu&#x27;azzam in Damascus, an alliance which had been discussed with Egyptian envoys in Italy. But after continually delaying his departure for the Holy Land, including suffering an outbreak of disease in his fleet, he was excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX in 1227. The crusaders, led not by Frederick but by his representatives Richard Filangieri, Henry IV, Duke of Limburg, and Hermann of Salza, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, arrived in the east late in 1227, and while waiting for the emperor they set about refortifying Sidon, where they built the sea castle, and Montfort, which later became the headquarters of the Teutonic Knights. The Ayyubids of Damascus did not dare attack, as al-Mu&#x27;azzam had suddenly died not long before. Frederick finally arrived on the Sixth Crusade in September 1228, and claimed the regency of the kingdom in the name of his infant son.

Frederick immediately came into conflict with the native nobles of Outremer, some of whom resented his attempts to impose Imperial authority over both Cyprus and Jerusalem. The Cypriot nobles were already quarrelling amongst themselves about the regency for Henry I of Cyprus, who was still a child. The High Court of Cyprus had elected John of Ibelin as regent, but Henry&#x27;s mother Alice of Champagne wished to appoint one of her supporters; Alice and her party, members or supporters of the Lusignan dynasty, sided with Frederick, whose father had crowned Aimery of Lusignan king in 1197. At Limassol, Frederick demanded that John give up not only the regency of Cyprus, but also John&#x27;s own lordship of Beirut on the mainland. John argued that Frederick had no legal authority to make such demands and refused to give up either title. Frederick then imprisoned John&#x27;s sons as hostages to guarantee John&#x27;s support for his crusade.

John did accompany Frederick to the mainland, but Frederick was not well-received there; one of his few supporters was Balian, Lord of Sidon, who had welcomed the crusaders the year before and now acted as an ambassador to the Ayyubids. The death of al-Mu&#x27;azzam negated the proposed alliance with al-Kamil, who along with his brother al-Ashraf had taken possession of Damascus (as well as Jerusalem) from their nephew, al-Mu&#x27;azzam&#x27;s son an-Nasir Dawud. However, al-Kamil presumably did not know of the small size of Frederick&#x27;s army, nor the divisions within it caused by his excommunication, and wished to avoid defending his territories against another crusade. Frederick&#x27;s presence alone was sufficient to regain Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and a number of surrounding castles without a fight: these were recovered in February 1229, in return for a ten-year truce with the Ayyubids and freedom of worship for Jerusalem&#x27;s Muslim inhabitants. The terms of the treaty were unacceptable to the Patriarch of Jerusalem Gerald of Lausanne, who placed the city under interdict. In March, Frederick crowned himself in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but because of his excommunication and the interdict Jerusalem was never truly reincorporated into the kingdom, which continued to be ruled from Acre.

Meanwhile, in Italy, the Pope used Frederick&#x27;s excommunication as an excuse to invade his Italian territories; the papal armies were led by Frederick&#x27;s former father-in-law John of Brienne. Frederick was forced to return home in 1229, leaving the Holy Land by the citizens of Acre.

=== War of the Lombards and the Barons&#x27; Crusade ===
Nevertheless, Frederick sent an Imperial army in 1231, under Richard Filangieri, who occupied Beirut and Tyre, but was unable to gain control of Acre. John&#x27;s supporters formed a commune in Acre, of which John himself was elected mayor in 1232. With the help of the Genoese merchants, the commune recaptured Beirut. John also attacked Tyre, but was defeated by Filangieri at the Battle of Casal Imbert in May 1232.

In Cyprus, King Henry I came of age in 1232 and John&#x27;s regency was no longer necessary. Both John and Filangieri raced back to Cyprus to assert their authority, and the imperial forces were defeated at the Battle of Agridi on June 15. Henry became the undisputed king of Cyprus, but continued to support the Ibelins over the Lusignans and the imperial party. On the mainland, Filangieri had the support of Bohemund IV of Antioch, the Teutonic Knights, the Knights Hospitaller, and the Pisan merchants. John was supported by his nobles on Cyprus, and by his continental holdings in Beirut, Caesarea, and Arsuf, as well as by the Knights Templar and the Genoese. Neither side could make any headway, and in 1234 Gregory IX excommunicated John and his supporters. This was partly revoked in 1235, but still no peace could be made. John died in 1236 and the war was taken up by his son Balian of Beirut and his nephew Philip of Montfort.

Meanwhile, the treaty with the Ayyubids was set to expire in 1239. Plans for a new crusade to be led by Frederick came to nothing, and Frederick himself was excommunicated by Gregory IX again in 1239. However, other European nobles took up the cause, including Theobald IV, Count of Champagne and King of Navarre, Peter of Dreux, and Amaury de Montfort, who arrived in Acre in September 1239. Theobald was elected leader of the crusade at a council in Acre, attended by most of the important nobles of the kingdom, including Walter of Brienne, John of Arsuf, and Balian of Sidon. The arrival of the crusade was a brief respite from the Lombard War; Filangieri remained in Tyre and did not participate. The council decided to refortify Ascalon in the south and attack Damascus in the north.

The crusaders may have been aware of the new divisions among the Ayyubids; al-Kamil had occupied Damascus in 1238 but had died soon afterwards, and his territory was inherited by his family. His sons al-Adil abu Bakr and as-Salih Ayyub inherited Egypt and Damascus. Ayyub marched on Cairo in an attempt to drive out al-Adil, but during his absence al-Kamil&#x27;s brother as-Salih Isma&#x27;il took over Damascus, and Ayyub was taken prisoner by an-Nasir Dawud. The Crusaders, meanwhile, marched to Ascalon. Along the way, Walter of Brienne captured livestock intended to resupply Damascus, as the Ayyubids had probably learned of the Crusaders&#x27; plans to attack it. The victory was short-lived, however, as the Crusaders were then defeated by the Egyptian army at Gaza in November 1239. Henry II, Count of Bar was killed and Amaury of Montfort captured. The Crusaders returned to Acre, possibly because the native barons of the kingdom were suspicious of Filangieri in Tyre. Dawud took advantage of the Ayyubid victory to recapture Jerusalem in December, the ten-year truce having expired.

Although Ayyub was Dawud&#x27;s prisoner, the two now allied against al-Adil in Egypt, which Ayyub seized in 1240. In Damascus, Isma&#x27;il recognized the threat of Dawud and Ayyub against his own possessions, and turned to the Crusaders for assistance. Theobald concluded a treaty with Isma&#x27;il, in return for territorial concessions that restored Jerusalem to Christian control, as well as much of the rest of the former kingdom, even more territory than Frederick had recovered in 1229. Theobald, however, was frustrated by the Lombard War, and returned home in September 1240. Almost immediately after Theobald&#x27;s departure, Richard of Cornwall arrived. He completed the rebuilding of Ascalon, and also made peace with Ayyub in Egypt. Ayyub confirmed Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s concessions in 1241, and prisoners taken at Gaza were exchanged by both sides. Richard returned to Europe in 1241.

Although the kingdom had essentially been restored, the Lombard War continued to occupy the kingdom&#x27;s nobility. As the Templars and Hospitallers supported opposite sides, they also attacked each other, and the Templars broke the treaty with the Ayyubids by attacking Nablus in 1241. Conrad proclaimed that he had come of age in 1242, eliminating both Frederick&#x27;s claim to the regency and the need for an imperial guardian to govern in his place, although he had not yet turned 15, the age of majority according to the customs of Jerusalem. Through Conrad, Frederick tried to send an imperial regent, but the anti-imperial faction in Acre argued that Jerusalem&#x27;s laws allowed them to appoint their own regent. In June the &quot;Haute Cour&quot; granted the regency to Alice of Champagne, who, as the daughter of Isabella I, was Conrad&#x27;s great-aunt and his closest relative living in the kingdom. Alice ordered Filangieri to be arrested, and along with the Ibelins and Venetians, besieged Tyre, which fell in July 1243. The Lombard War was over, but the king was still absent, as Conrad never came to the East. Alice was prevented from exercising any real power as regent by Philip of Montfort, who took control of Tyre, and Balian of Beirut, who continued to hold Acre.

=== Crusade of Louis IX ===
The Ayyubids were still divided between Ayyub in Egypt, Isma&#x27;il in Damascus, and Dawud in Kerak. Isma&#x27;il, Dawud, and al-Mansur Ibrahim of Homs went to war with Ayyub, who hired the Khwarazmians to fight for him. The Khwarazmians were nomadic Turks from central Asia, who had recently been displaced by the Mongols further to the east and were now residing in Mesopotamia. With Ayyub&#x27;s support, they sacked Jerusalem in the summer of 1244, leaving it in ruins and useless to both Christians and Muslims. In October, the Khwarazmians, along with the Egyptian army under the command of Baibars, were met by the Frankish army, led by Philip of Montfort, Walter of Brienne, and the masters of the Templars, Hospitallers, and Teutonic Knights, along with al-Mansur and Dawud. On October 17 the Egyptian-Khwarazmian army destroyed the Frankish-Syrian coalition, and Walter of Brienne was taken captive and later executed. By 1247, Ayyub had reoccupied most of the territory that had been conceded in 1239, and had also gained control of Damascus.

A new crusade was discussed at the Council of Lyon in 1245 by Pope Innocent IV. The council deposed Frederick II, so no help could be expected from the empire, but King Louis IX of France had already vowed to go on crusade. Louis arrived in Cyprus in 1248, where he gathered an army of his own men, including his brothers Robert of Artois, Charles of Anjou, and Alphonse of Poitiers, and those of Cyprus and Jerusalem, led by the Ibelin family John of Jaffa, Guy of Ibelin, and Balian of Beirut. Once again the target was Egypt. Damietta was captured without resistance when the Crusaders landed in June 1249, but the crusade halted there until November, by which time the Egyptian sultan Ayyub had died and had been succeeded by his son Turanshah. In February, the Crusaders were defeated at the Battle of al-Mansurah, where Robert of Artois was killed. The crusaders were unable to cross the Nile, and, suffering from disease and lack of supplies, retreated towards Damietta in April. They were defeated along the way at the Battle of Fariskur, with Louis being taken captive by Turanshah. During Louis&#x27; captivity, Turanshah was overthrown by his Mamluk soldiers, led by the general Aybak, who then released Louis in May in return for Damietta and a large ransom. For the next four years Louis resided in Acre, and helped refortify that city along with Caesarea, Jaffa, and Sidon. He also made truces with the Ayyubids in Syria, and sent embassies to negotiate with the Mongols, who were beginning to threaten the Muslim world, before returning home in 1254. He left behind a large garrison of French soldiers in Acre, under the command of Geoffrey of Sergines.

In the midst of these events, Alice of Champagne had died in 1246 and had been replaced as regent by her son King Henry I of Cyprus, for whom John of Jaffa served as &quot;bailli&quot; in Acre. During Louis IX&#x27;s stay in Acre, Henry I died in 1253, and was succeeded in Cyprus by his infant son Hugh II. Hugh was technically regent of Jerusalem as well, both for Conrad and for Conrad&#x27;s son Conradin after Conrad died in 1254. Both Cyprus and Jerusalem were governed by Hugh&#x27;s mother Plaisance of Antioch, but John remained &quot;bailli&quot; for Hugh in Acre. John made peace with Damascus and attempted to regain Ascalon; the Egyptians, now ruled by the Mamluk sultanate, besieged Jaffa in 1256 in response. John defeated them, and afterwards gave up the bailliage to his cousin John of Arsuf.

=== War of Saint Sabas ===
In 1256 the commercial rivalry between the Venetian and Genoese merchant colonies broke out into open warfare. In Acre, the two colonies disputed possession of the monastery of Saint Sabas. The Genoese, assisted by the Pisan merchants, attacked the Venetian quarter and burned their ships, but the Venetians drove them out. The Venetians were then expelled from Tyre by Philip of Monfort. John of Arsuf, John of Jaffa, John II of Beirut, the Templars, and the Teutonic Knights supported the Venetians, who also convinced the Pisans to join them, while the Hospitallers supported the Genoese. In 1257 the Venetians conquered the monastery and destroyed its fortifications, although they were unable to expel the Genoese completely. They blockaded the Genoese quarter, but the Genoese were supplied by the Hospitallers, whose complex was nearby, and by Philip of Montfort who sent food from Tyre. In August 1257, John of Arsuf tried to end the war by granting commercial rights in Acre to the Republic of Ancona, an Italian ally of Genoa, but aside from Philip of Montfort and the Hospitallers, the rest of the nobles continued to support Venice. In June 1258, Philip and the Hospitallers marched on Acre while a Genoese fleet attacked the city by sea. The naval battle was won by Venice, and the Genoese were forced to abandon their quarter and flee to Tyre with Philip. The war also spread to Tripoli and Antioch, where the Embriaco family, descended from Genoese crusaders, was pitted against Bohemond VI of Antioch, who supported the Venetians. In 1261 the Patriarch, Jacques Pantaleon, organised a council to re-establish order in the kingdom, though the Genoese did not return to Acre.

=== Mongols ===
It was during this period that the Mongols arrived in the Near East. Their presence further east had already displaced the Khwarazmians, and emissaries had been sent by various popes as well as Louis IX to ally or negotiate with them, but they were uninterested in alliances. They sacked Baghdad in 1258, and Aleppo and Damascus in 1260, destroying both the Abbasid caliphate and the last vestiges of the Ayyubid dynasty. Hethum I of Armenia and Bohemond VI of Antioch had already submitted to the Mongols as vassals. Some of the Mongols were Nestorian Christians, including Kitbuqa, one of the generals at the sieges of Baghdad and Damascus, but despite this, the nobles of Acre refused to submit. As the kingdom was by now a relatively unimportant state, the Mongols paid little attention to it, but there were a few skirmishes in 1260: the forces of Julian of Sidon killed the nephew of Kitbuqa, who responded by sacking Sidon, and John II of Beirut was also captured by the Mongols during another raid. The apparently inevitable Mongol conquest was stalled when Hulagu, the Mongol commander in Syria, returned home after the death of his brother Möngke Khan, leaving Kitbuqa with a small garrison. The Mamluks of Egypt then sought, and were granted, permission to advance through Frankish territory, and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260. Kitbuqa was killed and all of Syria fell under Mamluk control. On the way back to Egypt, the Mamluk sultan Qutuz was assassinated by the general Baibars, who was far less favourable than his predecessor to alliances with the Franks.

=== Fall of Acre ===

John of Arsuf had died in 1258 and was replaced as &quot;bailli&quot; by Geoffrey of Sergines, Louis IX&#x27;s lieutenant in Acre. Plaisance died in 1261, but as her son Hugh II was still underage, Cyprus passed to his cousin Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan, whose mother Isabella of Cyprus, Alice of Champagne and Hugh I of Cyprus&#x27; daughter and Hugh II&#x27;s aunt, took over the regency in Acre. She appointed, as &quot;bailli&quot;, her husband Henry of Antioch (who was also Plaisance&#x27;s uncle), but died in 1264. The regency in Acre was then claimed by Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan and his cousin Hugh of Brienne, and Hugh II died in 1267 before he reached the age of majority. Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan won the dispute and succeeded Hugh II on Cyprus as Hugh III. When Conradin was executed in Sicily in 1268, there was no other Hohenstaufen heir to succeed him, and Hugh III inherited the Kingdom of Jerusalem as well in 1269. This was disputed by another branch of the Lusignan family: Maria of Antioch, daughter of Bohemond IV of Antioch and Melisende of Lusignan (herself a daughter of Isabella I and Amalric II), claimed the throne as the oldest living relative of Isabella I, but for the moment her claim was ignored. By this time, the Mamluks under Baibars were taking advantage of the kingdom&#x27;s constant disputes, and began conquering the remaining crusader cities along the coast. In 1265, Baibars took Caesarea, Haifa and Arsuf, and Safad and Toron in 1266. In 1268 he captured Jaffa and Beaufort, and then besieged and destroyed Antioch.
Hugh III and Baibars made a one-year truce after these conquests; Baibars knew that Louis IX was planning another crusade from Europe, and assumed that the target would once again be Egypt. But instead the crusade was diverted to Tunis, where Louis died. Baibars was free to continue his campaigns: in 1270 he had the Assassins kill Philip of Montfort, and in 1271 he captured the Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights strongholds of Krak des Chevaliers and Montfort Castle. He also besieged Tripoli, but abandoned it in May when Prince Edward of England arrived, the only part of Louis IX&#x27;s crusade to arrive in the east. Edward could do nothing except arrange a ten-year truce with Baibars, who nevertheless attempted to have him assassinated as well. Edward left in 1272, and despite the Second Council of Lyon&#x27;s plans for another crusade in 1274, no further large-scale expedition ever arrived. Hugh III&#x27;s authority on the mainland began to break down; he was an unpopular king, and Beirut, the only territory left outside of Acre and Tyre, started to act independently. Its heiress, Isabella of Ibelin (widow of Hugh II), actually placed it under Baibars&#x27; protection. Finding the mainland ungovernable, Hugh III left for Cyprus, leaving Balian of Arsuf as &quot;bailli&quot;. Then in 1277, Maria of Antioch sold her claim to the kingdom to Charles of Anjou, who sent Roger of San Severino to represent him. The Venetians and Templars supported the claim, and Balian was powerless to oppose him. Baibars died in 1277 and was succeeded by Qalawun. In 1281 the ten-year truce expired and was renewed by Roger. Roger returned to Europe after the Sicilian Vespers in 1282, and was replaced by Odo Poilechien. Hugh III attempted to re-assert his authority on the mainland by landing at Beirut in 1283, but this was ineffective and he died in Tyre in 1284. He was succeeded briefly by his son John II, who died soon after in 1285, and was succeeded by his brother, Hugh III&#x27;s other son Henry II. That year Qalawun captured the Hospitaller fortress of Marqab. Charles of Anjou also died in 1285, and the military orders and the commune of Acre accepted Henry II as king; Odo Poilechen refused to recognize him, but was allowed to hand Acre over to the Templars rather than Henry directly, and the Templars then handed it to the king. War broke out between the Venetians and Genoese again in 1287, and Tripoli fell to Qalawun in 1289. Although it was only a matter of time before Acre also fell, the end of the crusader kingdom was actually instigated in 1290 by newly arrived Crusaders, who rioted in Acre and attacked the city&#x27;s Muslim merchants. Qalawun died before he could retaliate, but his son al-Ashraf Khalil arrived to besiege Acre in April 1291. Acre was defended by Henry II&#x27;s brother Amalric of Tyre, the Hospitallers, Templars, and Teutonic Knights, the Venetians and Pisans, the French garrison led by Jean I de Grailly, and the English garrison led by Otton de Grandson, but they were vastly outnumbered. Henry II himself arrived in May during the siege, but the city fell on May 18. Henry, Amalric, Otton, and Jean escaped, as did a young Templar named Roger de Flor, but most of the other defenders did not, including the master of the Templars Guillaume de Beaujeu. Tyre fell without a fight the next day, Sidon fell in June, and Beirut in July.

The Crusaders moved their headquarters north to cities such as Tortosa, but lost that too, and were forced to relocate their headquarters offshore to Cyprus. Some naval raids and attempts to retake territory were made over the next ten years, but with the loss of the island of Arwad in 1302–1303, the Kingdom of Jerusalem ceased to exist on the mainland. The kings of Cyprus for many decades hatched plans to regain the Holy Land, but without success. For the next seven centuries, up to today, a veritable multitude of European monarchs have used the title of King of Jerusalem.

== Life in the early kingdom ==
 The Latin population of the kingdom was always small; although a steady stream of settlers and new crusaders continually arrived, most of the original crusaders who fought in the First Crusade simply went home. According to William of Tyre, in the kingdom in 1100 during Godfrey&#x27;s siege of Arsuf. From the very beginning, the Latins were little more than a colonial frontier exercising rule over the native Jewish, Samaritan, Muslim, Greek Orthodox, and Syriac populations.

As new generations grew up in the kingdom, they began to think of themselves as natives. Although they never gave up their core identity as Western Europeans or Franks, their clothing, diet, and commercialism integrated much oriental, particularly Byzantine, influence. As the chronicler Fulcher of Chartres wrote around 1124,

For we who were Occidentals now have been made Orientals. He who was a Roman or Frank has in this land been made into a Galilaean, or an inhabitant of Palestine. He who was of Rheims or Chartres has now become a citizen of Tyre or Antioch. We have already forgotten the places of our birth; already they have become unknown to many of us, or, at least, are unmentioned.

The crusaders and their descendants often learned to speak Greek, Arabic, and other eastern languages, and intermarried with the native Christians (whether Greek, Syriac, or Armenian) and sometimes with converted Muslims. Nonetheless, the Frankish principalities remained a distinctive Occidental colony in the heart of Islam.

Fulcher, a participant in the First Crusade and chaplain of Baldwin I, continued his chronicle up to 1127. Fulcher&#x27;s chronicle was very popular and was used as a source by other historians in the West, such as Orderic Vitalis and William of Malmesbury. Almost as soon as Jerusalem had been captured, and continuing throughout the 12th century, many pilgrims arrived and left accounts of the new kingdom; among them are the English Sæwulf, the Kievan Abbot Daniel, the Frank Fretellus, the Byzantine Johannes Phocas, and the Germans John of Würzburg and Theoderich. Aside from these, thereafter there is no eyewitness to events in Jerusalem until William of Tyre, archbishop of Tyre and chancellor of Jerusalem, who began writing around 1167 and died around 1184, although he includes much information about the First Crusade and the intervening years from the death of Fulcher to his own time, drawn mainly from the writings of Albert of Aix and Fulcher himself. From the Muslim perspective, a chief source of information is Usamah ibn Munqidh, a soldier and frequent ambassador from Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt, whose memoirs, &quot;Kitab al i&#x27;tibar&quot;, include lively accounts of crusader society in the east. Further information can be gathered from travellers such as Benjamin of Tudela and Ibn Jubayr.

=== Crusader society ===
The Kingdom at first was virtually bereft of a loyal subject population and had few knights to implement the laws and orders of the realm. With the arrival of Italian trading firms, the creation of the military orders, and immigration by European knights, artisans, and farmers, the affairs of the Kingdom improved and a feudal society developed, similar to but distinct from the society the crusaders knew in Europe. The nature of this society has long been a subject of debate among crusade historians.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, French scholars, such as E. G. Rey, Gaston Dodu, and René Grousset believed that the Crusaders, Muslims and Christians lived in a totally integrated society. Ronnie Ellenblum claims this view was influenced by French imperialism and colonialism; if medieval French crusaders could integrate themselves into local society, then certainly modern French colonies in the Levant could thrive. In the mid-20th century, scholars such as Joshua Prawer, R. C. Smail, Meron Benvenisti, and Claude Cahen argued instead that the Crusaders lived totally segregated from the native inhabitants, who were thoroughly Arabicized and/or Islamicized and were a constant threat to the foreign crusaders. Prawer argued further that the kingdom was an early attempt at colonization, in which the Crusaders were a small ruling class, who were dependent on the native population for survival but made no attempt to integrate with them. For this reason, the rural European society to which the Crusaders were accustomed was replaced by a more secure urban society in the pre-existing cities of the Levant.

According to Ellenblum&#x27;s interpretation, the inhabitants of the Kingdom (Latin Christians living alongside native Greek and Syriac Christians, Shia and Sunni Arabs, Sufis, Bedouin, Druze, Jews, and Samaritans) all had major differences between each other as well as with the crusaders. Relations between eastern Christians and the Latin Crusaders were , not simply friendly or hostile. He argues that Eastern Christians probably felt closer ties to their fellow Christian crusaders than Muslim Arabs.

Although the Crusaders came upon an ancient urban society, Ellenblum argues that they never completely abandoned their rural European lifestyle, nor was European society completely rural to begin with. Crusader settlement in the Levant resembled the types of colonization and settlement that were already being practised in Europe, a mixture of urban and rural civilization centred around fortresses. The Crusaders were neither totally integrated with the native population, nor segregated in the cities away from the rural natives; rather they settled in both urban and rural areas; specifically, in areas traditionally inhabited by Eastern Christians. Areas that were traditionally Muslim had very little crusader settlement, just as they already had very few native Christian inhabitants.

Into this mixed society the crusaders adapted existing institutions and introduced their familiar customs from Europe. As in Europe the nobles had vassals and were themselves vassals to the king. Agricultural production was regulated by the &quot;iqta&quot;, a Muslim system of land ownership and payments roughly (though far from exactly) equivalent to the feudal system of Europe, and this system was not heavily disrupted by the Crusaders.

As Hans Mayer says, , so information on their role in society is difficult to find. The Crusaders Although Muslims, as well as Jews and Eastern Christians, had virtually no rights in the countryside, where they were essentially the property of the crusader lord who owned the land, tolerance for other faiths was, in general, no higher or lower than that found elsewhere in the Middle East. Greeks, Syriacs, and Jews continued to live as they had before, subject to their own laws and courts, with their former Muslim overlords simply replaced by the Crusaders; Muslims now joined them at the lowest level of society. The &quot;ra&#x27;is&quot;, the leader of a Muslim or Syriac community, was a kind of vassal to whatever noble owned his land, but as the crusader nobles were absentee landlords the &quot;ra&#x27;is&quot; and their communities had a high degree of autonomy.

Arab-Andalusian geographer and traveller Ibn Jubayr, who was hostile to the Franks, described the Muslims living under the Christian crusaders&#x27; Kingdom of Jerusalem in the late 12th-century:

In the cities, Muslims and Eastern Christians were free, although no Muslims were permitted to live in Jerusalem itself. They were second-class citizens and played no part in politics or law, and owed no military service to the crown, although in some cities they may have been the majority of the population. Likewise, citizens of the Italian city-states owed nothing as they lived in autonomous quarters in the port cities.

21st century positions on the question of cultural integration or cultural apartheid remain divergent. Interactions between the Franks and the native Muslims and Christians, though muddled, exhibited a practical coexistence. Though likely overstated, the accounts of Usamah Ibn-Munqidh of Shaizar&#x27;s travels through Antioch and Jerusalem described a level of aristocratic exchange elevated above ethnic prejudice. Contact between Muslims and Christians came on the administrative or personal level (on the basis of taxes or translation), not communal or cultural, representative of a hierarchical lord over subject relationship. Evidence of inter-cultural integration remains scarce, but evidence of inter-cultural cooperation and complex social interaction proves more common. Key use of the word dragoman, literally translator, with Syriac administrators and Arabic headsmen represented the direct need for negotiation of interests on both sides. Comments on households with Arabic-speaking Christians and a few Arabized Jews and Muslims represent a less dichotomous relationship than the mid-20th-century historians depicted. Rather, the commonality of Frankish Christians having non-Frankish priests, doctors, and other roles within households and inter-cultural communities presents the lack of standardized discrimination. Jerusalemite William of Tyre complained about a trend to hire Jewish or Muslim medical practitioners over their Latin and Frankish counterparts. Evidence even indicates alterations to Frankish cultural and social customs regarding hygiene (notorious amongst Arabs for their lack of washing and knowledge of bathhouse culture), going so far as to ensure water supplies for domestic use in addition to irrigation.

=== Population ===
It is impossible to give an accurate estimate of the population of the kingdom. Josiah Russell calculates that all of Syria had about 2.3 million people at the time of the crusades, with perhaps eleven thousand villages; most of these, of course, were outside of crusader rule even at the greatest extent of all four crusader states. It has been estimated by scholars such as Joshua Prawer and Meron Benvenisti that there were at most 120,000 Franks and 100,000 Muslims living in the cities, with another 250,000 Muslim and Eastern Christian peasants in the countryside. The Crusaders accounted for 15–25% of the total population. Benjamin Z. Kedar estimates that there were between 300,000 and 360,000 non-Franks in the Kingdom, 250,000 of whom were villagers in the countryside, and As Ronnie Ellenblum points out, there simply is not enough existing evidence to accurately count the population and any estimate is inherently unreliable. Contemporary chronicler William of Tyre recorded the census of 1183, which was intended to determine the number of men available to defend against an invasion, and to determine the amount of tax money that could be obtained from the inhabitants, Muslim or Christian. If the population was actually counted, William did not record the number. In the 13th century, John of Ibelin drew up a list of fiefs and the number of knights owed by each, but this gives no indication of the non-noble, non-Latin population.

The Mamluks, led by Baibars, eventually made good their pledge to cleanse the entire Middle East of the Franks. With the fall of Antioch (1268), Tripoli (1289), and Acre (1291), those Christians unable to leave the cities were massacred or enslaved and the last traces of Christian rule in the Levant disappeared.

=== Slavery ===
An unknown number of Muslim slaves lived in the Kingdom. There was a very large slave market in Acre that functioned throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Italian merchants were sometimes accused of selling Southeastern European Christians as slaves along with Muslim slaves. Slavery was less common than ransom, especially for prisoners of war; the large numbers of prisoners taken during raids and battles every year ensured that ransom money flowed freely between the Christian and Muslim states. Escape for prisoners and slaves was probably not difficult, as the inhabitants of the countryside were majority Muslim, and fugitive slaves were always a problem. The only legal means of manumission was conversion to (Catholic) Christianity. No Christian, whether Western or Eastern, was permitted by law to be sold into slavery.

The assizes of Jerusalem provided a legal framework for slavery in the Kingdom. The document stipulated that could be traded. &quot;Villeins&quot; were rural semi-free laborers akin to serfs. There were also multiple ways to become chattel slaves. People could be slaves by birth, enslaved by being captured in a raid, or as a penalty for debt or for helping a runaway slave.

The nomadic Bedouin tribes were considered to be the property of the king and under his protection. They could be sold or alienated just like any other property, and later in the 12th century, they were often under the protection of a lesser noble or one of the military orders.

=== Economy ===

The urban composition of the area, combined with the presence of the Italian merchants, led to the development of an economy that was much more commercial than it was agricultural. Palestine had always been a crossroads for trade; now, this trade extended to Europe as well. European goods, such as the woolen textiles of northern Europe, made their way to the Middle East and Asia, while Asian goods were transported back to Europe. Jerusalem was especially involved in the silk, cotton and spice trade; other items that first appeared in Europe through trade with crusader Jerusalem included oranges and sugar, the latter of which chronicler William of Tyre called In the countryside, wheat, barley, legumes, olives, grapes, and dates were grown. The Italian city-states made enormous profits from this trade, thanks to commercial treaties like the , and it influenced their Renaissance in later centuries.

Colonies of Genoa and Venice in Palestine also took on agricultural ventures in their concessions. They especially cultivated Sugar for export to Europe. Sugar cane had been introduced in Palestine by the Arabs. To work on the sugar fields, Italian colonists utilized slaves or serfs of Arab or Syrian origin, or local serfs. Sugar manufacturing began in Tyre. In the 13th century, sugar production continued to increase in Palestine, and merchants could export it duty-free through the port of Acre until its conquest in 1291. The sugar exploitation system pioneered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem is seen as a precursor to the sugar plantations in the Americas.

Jerusalem collected money through tribute payments, first from the coastal cities which had not yet been captured, and later from other neighbouring states such as Damascus and Egypt, which the Crusaders could not conquer directly. After Baldwin I extended his rule over Oultrejordain, Jerusalem gained revenue from the taxation of Muslim caravans passing from Syria to Egypt or Arabia. The money economy of Jerusalem meant that their manpower problem could be partially solved by paying for mercenaries, an uncommon occurrence in medieval Europe. Mercenaries could be fellow European crusaders, or, perhaps more often, Muslim soldiers, including the famous Turcopoles.

=== Education ===

Jerusalem was the centre of education in the kingdom. There was a school in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where the basic skills of reading and writing Latin were taught; The relative wealth of the merchant class meant that their children could be educated there along with the children of nobles – it is likely that William of Tyre was a classmate of future king Baldwin III. Higher education had to be undertaken at one of the universities in Europe; the development of a university was impossible in the culture of crusader Jerusalem, where warfare was far more important than philosophy or theology. Nonetheless, the nobility and general Frankish population were noted for their high literacy: lawyers and clerks were in abundance, and the study of law, history, and other academic subjects was a beloved pastime of the royal family and the nobility. Jerusalem had an extensive library not only of ancient and medieval Latin works but of Arabic literature, much of which was apparently captured from Usamah ibn Munqidh and his entourage after a shipwreck in 1154. The Holy Sepulchre contained the kingdom&#x27;s scriptorium and the city had a chancery where royal charters and other documents were produced. Aside from Latin, the standard written language of medieval Europe, the populace of crusader Jerusalem communicated in vernacular forms of French and Italian; Greek, Armenian, and even Arabic were used by Frankish settlers.

=== Art and architecture ===
In Jerusalem itself, the greatest architectural endeavour was the expansion of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in western Gothic style. This expansion consolidated all the separate shrines on the site into one building, and was completed by 1149. Outside of Jerusalem, castles and fortresses were the major focus of construction: Kerak and Montreal in Oultrejordain and Ibelin near Jaffa are among the numerous examples of crusader castles.

Crusader art was a mix of Western, Byzantine, and Islamic styles. The major cities featured baths, interior plumbing, and other advanced hygienic tools which were lacking in most other cities and towns throughout the world. The foremost examples of crusader art are perhaps the Melisende Psalter, an illuminated manuscript commissioned between 1135 and 1143 and now located in the British Library, and the sculpted Nazareth Capitals. Paintings and mosaics were popular forms of art in the kingdom, but many of these were destroyed by the Mamluks in the 13th century; only the most durable fortresses survived the reconquest.

=== Government and legal system ===
Immediately after the First Crusade, land was distributed to loyal vassals of Godfrey, forming numerous feudal lordships within the kingdom. This was continued by Godfrey&#x27;s successors. The number and importance of the lordships varied throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and many cities were part of the royal domain. The king was assisted by a number of officers of state. The king and the royal court were normally located in Jerusalem, but due to the prohibition on Muslim inhabitants, the capital was small and underpopulated. The king just as often held court at Acre, Nablus, Tyre, or wherever else he happened to be. In Jerusalem, the royal family lived firstly on the Temple Mount, before the foundation of the Knights Templar, and later in the palace complex surrounding the Tower of David; there was another palace complex in Acre.

Because the nobles tended to live in Jerusalem rather than on estates in the countryside, they had a larger influence on the king than they would have had in Europe. The nobles, along with the bishops, formed the , which was responsible for confirming the election of a new king (or a regent if necessary), collecting taxes, minting coins, allotting money to the king, and raising armies. The was the only judicial body for the nobles of the kingdom, hearing criminal cases such as murder, rape, and treason, and simpler feudal disputes such as the recovery of slaves, sales and purchases of fiefs, and default of service. Punishments included forfeiture of land and exile, or in extreme cases death. The first laws of the kingdom were, according to tradition, established during Godfrey of Bouillon&#x27;s short reign, but were more probably established by Baldwin II at the Council of Nablus in 1120. Benjamin Z. Kedar argued that the canons of the Council of Nablus were in force in the 12th century but had fallen out of use by the thirteenth. Marwan Nader questions this and suggests that the canons may not have applied to the whole kingdom at all times. The most extensive collection of laws, together known as the Assizes of Jerusalem, were written in the mid-13th century, although many of them are purported to be twelfth-century in origin.

There were other, lesser courts for non-nobles and non-Latins; the provided justice for non-noble Latins, dealing with minor criminal offences such as assault and theft, and provided rules for disputes between non-Latins, who had fewer legal rights. Special courts such as the (for commercial disputes in the markets) and the (an admiralty court) existed in the coastal cities. The extent to which native Islamic and Eastern Christian courts continued to function is unknown, but the &quot;ra&#x27;is&quot; probably exercised some legal authority on a local level. The judged non-criminal matters among the native Christians (the &quot;Syriacs&quot;). For criminal matters, non-Latins were to be tried in the (or even the if the crime was sufficiently severe).

The Italian communes were granted almost complete autonomy from the very early days of the Kingdom, thanks to their military and naval support in the years following the First Crusade. This autonomy included the right to administer their own justice, although the kinds of cases that fell under their jurisdiction varied at different times.

The king was recognised as head of the Haute Cour, although he was legally only .

== Legacy ==
After the loss of all territory in the Levant in 1291, there were late attempts at further crusades, nominally proposing to recapture Jerusalem, but with the rise of the Ottoman Empire
their character was more and more that of a desperate defensive war rarely reaching beyond the Balkans (Alexandrian Crusade, Smyrniote crusades).
Henry IV of England made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1393–4, and he later vowed to lead a crusade to recapture the city, but he did not undertake such a campaign before his death in 1413.
The Levant remained under Ottoman control from 1517 until the Partition of the Ottoman Empire in 1918.

With the Fall of Ruad in 1302, the Kingdom of Jerusalem lost its final outpost on the Levantine coast, its possession closest to the Holy Land now being Cyprus.
Henry II of Jerusalem retained the title of king of Jerusalem until his death in 1324, and the title continued to be claimed by his successors, the kings of Cyprus.
The title of &quot;king of Jerusalem&quot; was also continuously used by the Angevin kings of Naples, whose founder, Charles of Anjou, had in 1277 bought a claim to the throne from Mary of Antioch. Thereafter, this claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem was treated as a tributary of the crown of Naples, which often changed hands by testament or conquest rather than direct inheritance. As Naples was a papal fief, the Popes often endorsed the title of King of Jerusalem as well as of Naples, and the history of these claims is that of the Neapolitan Kingdom.
In 1441, control of the Kingdom of Naples was lost to Alfonso V of Aragon and the title thus was claimed by the kings of Spain, and after the War of the Spanish Succession both by the House of Bourbon and the House of Habsburg.
The title is still in use by the Spanish Crown, currently held by Felipe VI of Spain. It was also claimed by Otto von Habsburg as Habsburg pretender until 1958, and by the kings of Italy until 1946.

<text>Korfball ( ) is a ball sport, with similarities to netball and basketball. The objective is to throw a ball into a netless basket that is mounted on a pole. Each team is composed of four female players and four male players. The sport was created in the Netherlands in 1902 by schoolteacher Nico Broekhuysen, and has since spread globally.

== History ==

In 1901, Dutch schoolteacher Nico Broekhuysen travelled to the Swedish town of Nääs to take an educational course on teaching gymnastics to children. While there, he was introduced to &quot;ringboll&quot;. The objective of this Swedish game was to score points by throwing a ball through a ring attached to a pole that was in height. The field below was divided into three zones, and each player was confined to his or her assigned zone. Men and women played together. Upon Broekhuysen&#x27;s return to Amsterdam, he began to teach his students a modified version of &quot;ringboll&quot;. Broekhuysen replaced the ring with a basket to make it easier to see whether the ball had gone through it and scored a point. With his young students in mind, he also simplified the rules.

The name &quot;korfball&quot; derives from , a Dutch word meaning &#x27;basket&#x27;. 

Korfball was featured as a demonstration sport in the Summer Olympics of 1920 and 1928. It has been included in the World Games since 1985. 

The International Korfball Federation (IKF) was founded in 1933 in Antwerp, Belgium. IKF World Korfball Championships have been held every four years since 1978. The most successful nations at these competitions have been the Netherlands, Belgium, and Taiwan. The IKF announced in March 2022 that due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Korfball Federation would not be invited to any international competition until further notice, effectively banning Russian athletes from such events. Furthermore, the Russian Korfball Federation would not be eligible to bid to host any IKF event, nor were any IKF events planned to be held in Russia.

As of 2022, korfball is played in 69 countries and on every populated continent. In the Netherlands, there are approximately 500 clubs and more than 90,000 players. 

The oldest korfball club that is still in existence, and has never merged with another, is HKC ALO in The Hague, having been founded on 1 February 1906.

== Rules and regulations ==

=== Equipment ===

Korfball is played inside in winter and outdoors in spring, summer and autumn.

The size of the indoor court is , as are most outdoor courts. The court is divided into halves called &quot;zones&quot;. In each zone is a tall post with a basket at the top. This is positioned two-thirds of the distance between the center line and the back of the zone.

The ball is very similar to the one used in association football, with a circumference of 68.0-70.5 cm (or diameter of 21.75-22.45 cm), a weight of 445-475 grams, and a bounce height of 1.10-1.30 meters when dropped from a height of 1.80 meters.

=== Team ===
A korfball team consists of eight players: four female and four male.

=== Match ===
An international korfball match typically consists of two halves or four periods, with the length varying depending on the competition. When the match consists of halves, the duration is typically 25 minutes, with periods typically between 7 and 10 minutes, with a one-minute break between the first and second periods and between the third and fourth periods. At half time the break is five or ten minutes.

Four players of each team are in one zone and the other four are in the other zone. Within each zone, a player may only defend a member of the opposite team of the same gender.

At the beginning of the match, one team chooses a particular half of the court. That half will be that team&#x27;s defending zone, with &quot;their&quot; basket in it. Players score by throwing the ball through the opposing team&#x27;s basket. After two goals, the teams change zones: defenders become attackers and attackers become defenders. In between those zone-changes, attackers cannot set foot on their defending zone or vice versa. At half time the teams swap halves of the court.

The rules prevent physical strength dominating the game. Blocking, tackling, and holding are not allowed, nor is kicking the ball.

Once a player has the ball, that player cannot dribble or walk with it; however, the player can move one foot as long as the foot on which the player landed when catching the ball stays in the same spot. Therefore, tactical and efficient teamwork is required, because players need each other in order to keep the ball moving.

A player may not attempt to score when defended, which occurs when the defender is in between the opponent and the basket, is facing his/her opponent, or is within arm&#x27;s length and attempting to block the ball. This rule encourages fast movement while also limiting the impact of players&#x27; height compared to their opponents.

==International tournaments==

=== World Games===

The national teams competition organized by the International World Games Association has been played roughly every four years since 1981.

=== IKF World Korfball Championship===

=== Continental championships ===
IKF promotes four continental championships: European Korfball Championship, All-Africa Korfball Championship, Pan-American Korfball Championship and Asia-Oceania Korfball Championship.

=== International club competitions ===

The IKF used to organize the Europa Cup competition for national champions (clubs) every year. The Europa Cup was organized for the first time in 1967, and was won by Ons Eibernest from the Netherlands. The winner of the last edition was Fortuna/Delta Logistiek, which won the 2020 edition.

PKC from Papendrecht, the Netherlands, have won the championship the most times, a record 12 wins in total.

Until now, the winning team was either from the Netherlands or Belgium, with respectively 45 and 6 Europa Cups. The only club from the United Kingdom to reach the final was Mitcham Korfball Club from London. Mitcham lost the final against Catbavrienden from Belgium in 1998.

On 25 January 2022 IKF announced the introduction of the IKF Europe Korfball Champions League meant as a replacement for the IKF Europa Cup and IKF Europa Shield competitions. The first edition of the competition was the 2022/2023 edition.

==Beach korfball==
For beach korfball, the rules of the game differ slightly from those of regular korfball. Each team has 4 starting players and up to 4 substitutes. The field of play is 20 metres by 10 metres, and goals are to be placed 4 metres from the end line. Matches consist of two halves of 6 minutes with a 1-minute rest.

Each team has 4 players in the field, two men and two women. Players can be substituted at any time. 
Furthermore, if a goal is scored from a 2-point zone, a two-point goal is awarded. Free shots can both be executed at the standard Free Shot line, or at the spot where the fault was made by the opponent.

The current Beach Korfball World Champion is Poland, who won the World Beach Korfball Championship in Nador, Morocco in 2022. 13 teams were represented with Portugal taking silver and Belgium bronze.
