<doc id="18629" wikidata="Q178780" url="?curid=18629" title="Liqueur">
<text>A liqueur ( , ; ) is an alcoholic drink composed of spirits (often rectified spirit) and additional flavorings such as sugar, fruits, herbs, and spices. Often served with or after dessert, they are typically heavily sweetened and un-aged, beyond a resting period during production, when necessary, for their flavors to mingle.

Liqueurs are historical descendants of herbal medicines. They were made in France as early as the 13th century, often prepared by monks (for example, Chartreuse). Today they are produced all over the world, commonly served neat, over ice, with coffee, in cocktails, and used in cooking.

== Etymology ==
The French word &quot;liqueur&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;liquifacere&quot;, which means &quot;to dissolve&quot;.

In some parts of the United States and Canada, liqueurs may be referred to as cordials, or schnapps. This can cause confusion as in the United Kingdom a cordial would refer to a non-alcoholic concentrated fruit syrup, typically diluted to taste and consumed as a non-carbonated soft drink. Schnapps, on the other hand, can refer to any distilled beverage in Germany and aquavit in Scandinavian countries.

== Legal definitions ==
In the United States, where spirits are often called &quot;liquor&quot;, there is often confusion discerning between liqueurs and liquors, due to the many different types of flavored spirits that are available today (e.g., flavored vodka). Liqueurs generally contain a lower alcohol content (15–30% ABV) than spirits and have a sweetener mixed, while some can have an ABV as high as 55%.

=== Canada ===
Under the Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870), liqueurs are produced from mixing alcohol with plant materials. These materials include juices or extracts from fruits, flowers, leaves or other plant materials. The extracts are obtained by soaking, filtering or softening the plant substances. A sweetening agent should be added in an amount that is at least 2.5 percent of the finished liqueur. The alcohol percentage shall be at least 23%. It may also contain natural or artificial flavoring and color.

=== European Union ===
The European Union directive on spirit drinks provides guidelines applicable to all liqueurs. As such, a liqueur must
* contain a minimum of 15% alcohol by volume,
* in most cases, contain sweetening equivalent to at least 100 grams of inverted sugar per liter,
* be created using neutral grain alcohol and/or distillate(s) of agricultural origin, 
* be flavored with natural, or nature-identical, flavorings, and
* be labeled with the alcohol content and a list of any food colorings.

=== United States ===
The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates liqueurs similarly to Canada. Liqueurs (and also cordials) are defined as products created by mixing or redistilling distilled spirits with fruit, plant products, natural flavors, extracts, or sweeteners. These additives must be added in an amount not less than 2.5% by weight of the final product.

== Preparation ==
Some liqueurs are prepared by infusing certain woods, fruits, or flowers in either water or alcohol and adding sugar or other items. Others are distilled from aromatic or flavoring agents.

Anise and Rakı liqueurs have the property of turning from transparent to cloudy when added to water: the oil of anise remains in solution in the presence of a high concentration of alcohol, but coalesces when the alcohol concentration is reduced; this is known as the ouzo effect.

== Use ==
=== Cocktails ===
Liqueurs are sometimes mixed into cocktails to provide flavor.

Adding liqueurs to a cocktail can change the flavour and appearance of the cocktail. Whilst some liqueurs are coloured and designed to make the cocktail pop in colour, others are clear to prevent the liqueur from taking over the colour of the base spirit or garnish.

=== Layered drinks ===
Layered drinks are made by floating different-colored liqueurs in separate layers. Each liqueur is poured slowly into a glass over the back of a spoon or down a glass rod, so that the liquids of different densities remain unmixed, creating a striped effect.

<doc id="18630" wikidata="Q180627" url="?curid=18630" title="Lilith">
<text>Lilith (; ), also spelled Lilit, Lilitu, or Lilis, is a feminine figure in Mesopotamian and Jewish mythology, theorized to be the first wife of Adam and a primordial she-demon. Lilith is cited as having been &quot;banished&quot; from the Garden of Eden for not complying with and obeying Adam.

The original Hebrew word from which the name Lilith is taken is in the Biblical Hebrew, in the Book of Isaiah, though Lilith herself is not mentioned in any biblical text. In late antiquity in Mandaean and Jewish sources from 500 AD onward, Lilith appears in historiolas (incantations incorporating a short mythic story) in various concepts and localities that give partial descriptions of her. She is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Eruvin 100b, Niddah 24b, Shabbat 151b, Bava Batra 73a), in the &quot;Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan&quot; as Adam&#x27;s first wife, and in the &quot;Zohar&quot; § Leviticus 19a as &quot;a hot fiery female who first cohabited with man&quot;. Many rabbinic authorities, including Maimonides and Menachem Meiri, reject the existence of Lilith.

The name Lilith stems from , , and ). The Akkadian word &quot;lilû&quot; is related to the Hebrew word appearing in Isaiah 34:14, which is thought to be a night bird by some modern scholars such as Judit M. Blair. In Mesopotamian religion, found in the cuneiform texts of Sumer, Assyria, and Babylonia, &quot;lilîtu&quot; is a spirit or demon. Many have also connected her to the Mesopotamian demon Lamashtu, who shares similar traits and a similar position in mythology to Lilith.

Lilith continues to serve as source material in today&#x27;s literature, popular culture, Western culture, occultism, fantasy, horror, and erotica.

== History ==
In some Jewish folklore, such as the &quot;Alphabet of Sirach&quot; (), Lilith appears as Adam&#x27;s first wife, who was created at the same time and from the same clay as Adam. The legend of Lilith developed extensively during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadah, the Zohar, and Jewish mysticism. For example, in the 13th-century writings of Isaac ben Jacob ha-Cohen, Lilith left Adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the Garden of Eden after she had coupled with the archangel Samael.

Interpretations of Lilith found in later Jewish materials are plentiful, but little information has survived relating to the Sumerian, Assyrian and Babylonian views of this class of demons. Recent scholarship has disputed the relevance of two sources previously used to connect the Jewish to an Akkadian – the Gilgamesh appendix and the Arslan Tash amulets (see below for discussion of these two problematic sources).

In contrast, some scholars, such as Lowell K. Handy, hold the view that though Lilith derives from Mesopotamian demonology, evidence of the Hebrew Lilith being present in the sources frequently cited – the Sumerian Gilgamesh fragment and the Sumerian incantation from Arshlan-Tash being two – is scant, if present at all.

In Hebrew-language texts, the term or (translated as &quot;night creatures&quot;, &quot;night monster&quot;, &quot;night hag&quot;, or &quot;screech owl&quot;) first occurs in a list of animals in Isaiah 34. The Isaiah 34:14 Lilith reference does not appear in most common Bible translations such as KJV and NIV. Commentators and interpreters often envision the figure of Lilith as a dangerous demon of the night, who is sexually wanton, and who steals babies in the darkness. Currently there is no scholarly consensus, with some adhering to the animalistic interpretation, where as others claim 34:14 is referencing a literal demon or a category of demons falling under the specification of &quot;lilith&quot;. Historically, certain prominent Jewish rabbis in Talmudic texts feared the likes of liliths, some to such an extent that they recommended men not sleep in a home alone, as any who do would be &quot;seized by Lilith.&quot; Jewish incantation bowls and amulets from Mesopotamia from the first to the eighth centuries identify Lilith as a female demon and provide the first visual depictions of her. The said amulets were often symbolic divorce papers, warding off a given lilith that was thought to be haunting one&#x27;s house or family.

== Etymology ==

In the Akkadian language of Assyria and Babylonia, the terms and mean spirits. Some uses of are listed in the Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (CAD, 1956, L.190), in Wolfram von Soden&#x27;s &quot;Akkadisches Handwörterbuch&quot; (AHw, p. 553), and &quot;Reallexikon der Assyriologie&quot; (RLA, p. 47).

The Sumerian female demons have no etymological relation to Akkadian , &quot;evening&quot;.

Archibald Sayce (1882) considered that the Hebrew and the earlier Akkadian names are derived from Proto-Semitic. Charles Fossey (1902) has this literally translating to &quot;female night being/demon&quot;, although cuneiform inscriptions from Mesopotamia exist where &quot;Līlīt&quot; and &quot;Līlītu&quot; refers to disease-bearing wind spirits.

== Mesopotamian mythology ==
=== The spirit in the tree in the Gilgamesh cycle ===
Samuel Noah Kramer (1932, published 1938) translated as &quot;Lilith&quot; in Tablet XII of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; dated . Tablet XII is not part of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh,&quot; but is a later Assyrian Akkadian translation of the latter part of the Sumerian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. The is associated with a serpent and a zu bird. In &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot;, a huluppu tree grows in Inanna&#x27;s garden in Uruk, whose wood she plans to use to build a new throne. After ten years of growth, she comes to harvest it and finds a serpent living at its base, a Zu bird raising young in its crown, and that a made a house in its trunk. Gilgamesh is said to have killed the snake, and then the zu bird flew away to the mountains with its young, while the fearfully destroys its house and runs for the forest. Identification of the as Lilith is stated in the &quot;Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible&quot; (1999). According to a new source from late antiquity, Lilith appears in a Mandaean magic story where she is considered to represent the branches of a tree with other demonic figures that form other parts of the tree, though this may also include multiple &quot;Liliths&quot;.

Suggested translations for the Tablet XII spirit in the tree include as &quot;sacred place&quot;, as &quot;spirit&quot;, and as &quot;water spirit&quot;, but also simply &quot;owl&quot;, given that the is building a home in the trunk of the tree.

A connection between the Gilgamesh and the Jewish Lilith was rejected on textual grounds by Sergio Ribichini (1978).

=== The bird-footed woman in the Burney Relief ===
Kramer&#x27;s translation of the Gilgamesh fragment was used by Henri Frankfort (1937) and Emil Kraeling (1937) to support identification of a woman with wings and bird-feet in the disputed Burney Relief as related to Lilith. Frankfort and Kraeling identified the figure in the relief with Lilith. Today, the identification of the Burney Relief with Lilith is questioned. Modern research has the figure as one of the main goddesses of the Mesopotamian pantheons, most probably Ereshkigal. But the figure is more generally identified as the goddess of love and war: Thorkild Jacobsen identified the figure as Inanna in an analysis based on the existence of symbols and attributes commonly recognized to the goddess and on textual evidence.

=== The Arslan Tash amulets ===

The Arslan Tash amulets are limestone plaques discovered in 1933 at Arslan Tash, the authenticity of which is disputed. William F. Albright, Theodor H. Gaster, and others, accepted the amulets as a pre-Jewish source which shows that the name Lilith already existed in the 7th century BC but Torczyner (1947) identified the amulets as a later Jewish source.

===Lamashtu===

Many have alternatively drawn connections between Lilith and the Mesopotamian demon Lamashtu, due to their similar position and traits in both mythologies.

== In the Hebrew Bible ==
The word (or ) only appears once in the Hebrew Bible, in a prophecy regarding the fate of Edom. Most other nouns in the list appear more than once and thus are better documented, with the exception of another &quot;hapax legomenon&quot;: the word &quot;qippoz&quot;. The reading of scholars and translators is often guided by a decision about the complete list of eight creatures as a whole. Quoting from Isaiah 34 (NAB):
=== Hebrew text ===
In the Masoretic Text:


In the Dead Sea Scrolls, among the 19 fragments of Isaiah found at Qumran, the Great Isaiah Scroll (1Q1Isa) in 34:14 renders the creature as plural (or ).

Eberhard Schrader (1875) and Moritz Abraham Levy (1855) suggest that Lilith was a demon of the night, known also by the Jewish exiles in Babylon. Schrader&#x27;s and Levy&#x27;s view is therefore partly dependent on a later dating of Deutero-Isaiah to the 6th century BC and the presence of Jews in Baghdad in the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which would coincide with the possible references to the in Babylonian demonology. However, this view is challenged by Judit M. Blair, who argues that the context indicates unclean animals.

=== Greek version ===
The Septuagint translates both the reference to Lilith and the word for jackals or &quot;wild beasts of the island&quot; within the same verse into Greek as , apparently assuming them to refer to the same creatures and omitting &quot;wildcats/wild beasts of the desert.&quot; Under this reading, instead of the wildcats or desert beasts meeting with the jackals or island beasts, the goat or &quot;satyr&quot; crying &quot;to his fellow&quot; and lilith or &quot;screech owl&quot; resting &quot;there&quot;, it is the goat or &quot;satyr&quot;, translated as &quot;demons&quot;, and the jackals or island beasts &quot;&quot; meeting with each other and crying &quot;one to the other&quot; and the latter resting there.

=== Latin Bible ===
The early 5th-century Vulgate translated the same word as .

The translation is, &quot;And demons shall meet with monsters, and one hairy one shall cry out to another; there the lamia has lain down and found rest for herself&quot;.

=== English versions ===
Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible (1395) preserves the Latin rendering :

The Bishops&#x27; Bible of Matthew Parker (1568) from the Latin:

Douay–Rheims Bible (1582/1610) also preserves the Latin rendering :

The Geneva Bible of William Whittingham (1587) from the Hebrew:

Then the King James Version (1611):

The &quot;screech owl&quot; translation of the King James Version is, together with the &quot;owl&quot; (, probably a water bird) in 34:11 and the &quot;great owl&quot; (, translated in other versions as a snake) of 34:15, an attempt to render the passage by choosing suitable animals for difficult to translate Hebrew words.

Later translations include:
* night-owl (Young, 1898)
* night spectre (Rotherham, Emphasized Bible, 1902)
* night monster (ASV, 1901; JPS 1917, Good News Translation, 1992; NASB, 1995)
* vampires (Moffatt Translation, 1922; Knox Bible, 1950)
* night hag (Revised Standard Version, 1947)
* Lilith (Jerusalem Bible, 1966)

* nightjar (New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, 1984)
* night bird (English Standard Version, 2001)
* night-bird (NASB, 2020)
* nocturnal animals (New English Translation (NET Bible))

== Jewish tradition ==
Major sources in Jewish tradition regarding Lilith in chronological order include:
* c. 40–10 BC Dead Sea Scrolls – Songs for a Sage (4Q510–511)
* c. 200 Mishnah – not mentioned 
* c. 500 Gemara of the Talmud
* c. 700-1000 The Alphabet of Ben-Sira
* c. 900 Midrash Abkir
* c. 1260 Treatise on the Left Emanation, Spain
* c. 1280 Zohar, Spain.

=== Dead Sea Scrolls ===
The Dead Sea Scrolls contain one indisputable reference to Lilith in &quot;Songs of the Sage&quot; (4Q510–511) fragment 1:

And I, the Instructor, proclaim His glorious splendour so as to frighten and to te[rrify] all the spirits of the destroying angels, spirits of the bastards, demons, Lilith, howlers, and [desert dwellers] ... and those which fall upon men without warning to lead them astray from a spirit of understanding and to make their heart and their ... desolate during the present dominion of wickedness and predetermined time of humiliations for the sons of lig[ht], by the guilt of the ages of [those] smitten by iniquity – not for eternal destruction, [bu]t for an era of humiliation for transgression.

As with the Massoretic text of Isaiah 34:14, and therefore unlike the plural &quot;liliyyot&quot; (or &quot;liliyyoth&quot;) in the Isaiah scroll 34:14, &quot;lilit&quot; in 4Q510 is singular, this liturgical text both cautions against the presence of supernatural malevolence and assumes familiarity with Lilith; distinct from the biblical text, however, this passage does not function under any socio-political agenda, but instead serves in the same capacity as An Exorcism (4Q560) and Songs to Disperse Demons (11Q11). The text is thus, to a community &quot;deeply involved in the realm of demonology&quot;, an exorcism hymn.

Joseph M. Baumgarten (1991) identified the unnamed woman of &quot;The Seductress&quot; (4Q184) as related to the female demon. However, John J. Collins regards this identification as &quot;intriguing&quot; but that it is &quot;safe to say&quot; that (4Q184) is based on the strange woman of Proverbs 2, 5, 7, 9:


=== Early Rabbinic literature ===
Lilith does not occur in the Mishnah. The Jerusalem Talmud contains one mention in the 1523 Bomberg edition (Shabbat 6:9), which is not supported by any manuscript. The word &quot;lilit&quot; appears five times in the Babylonian Talmud:
* &quot;Rav Judah citing Samuel ruled: If an abortion has the likeness of &quot;lilit&quot;, its mother is unclean by reason of the birth, [for] it is a child except that it has wings.&quot; (b. Niddah 24b)
* &quot;[Expounding upon the curses of womanhood] In a baraita it was taught: She grows her hair like &quot;lilit&quot;, sits when urinating like an animal, and serves as a bolster for her husband.&quot; (b. Eruvin 100b)
* &quot;For a pricking sensation: he should bring an Arrow of Lilith and upturn it, and pour water on it and drink it. Alternatively he can take water of which a dog has drunk at night, but he must take care that it has not been exposed.&quot; (b. Gittin 69b). 
* &quot;Rabbah said: I saw Hormin the son of Lilith running on the parapet of the wall of Mahoza, and a rider, galloping below on horseback, could not overtake him. Once, they saddled for him two mules which stood on two bridges of the Rognag; and he jumped from one to the other, backward and forward, holding in his hands two cups of wine, pouring alternately from one to the other, and not a drop fell to the ground. This was a day of &#x27;They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths&#x27;, until word reached the house of the king and they killed him.&quot; (b. Bava Batra 73a-b).
* &quot;R. Hanina said: One may not sleep in a house alone, and whoever sleeps in a house alone is seized by &quot;lilit&quot;.&quot; (b. Shabbat 151b)

The above statement by Hanina may be related to the belief that nocturnal emissions engendered the birth of demons:
* &quot;R. Jeremiah b. Eleazar further stated: In all those years [130 years after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden] during which Adam was under the ban he begot ghosts and male demons and female demons [or night demons], for it is said in Scripture: And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years and begot a son in own likeness, after his own image, from which it follows that until that time he did not beget after his own image ... When he saw that through him death was ordained as punishment he spent a hundred and thirty years in fasting, severed connection with his wife for a hundred and thirty years, and wore clothes of fig on his body for a hundred and thirty years. – That statement [of R. Jeremiah] was made in reference to the semen which he emitted accidentally.&quot; (b. Eruvin 18b)

The Midrash Rabbah collection contains two references to Lilith. The first one is present in Genesis Rabbah 22:7 and 18:4: according to Rabbi Yehuda beRabbi, God proceeded to create a second Eve for Adam, after Lilith had to return to dust. However, to be exact the said passages do not employ the Hebrew word itself and instead speak of &quot;the first Eve&quot; (, analogical to Adam ha-Rishon &quot;the first Adam&quot;). Although in the medieval Hebrew literature and folklore, especially that reflected on the protective amulets of various kinds, &quot;The First Eve&quot; was identified with Lilith, one should remain careful in transposing this equation to the Late Antiquity.

The second mention of Lilith, this time explicit, is present in Numbers Rabbah 16:25. The midrash develops the story of Moses&#x27;s plea after God expresses anger at the bad report of the spies. Moses responds to a threat by God that He will destroy the Israelite people. Moses pleads before God, that God should not be like Lilith who kills her own children. Moses said:

=== Incantation bowls ===

An individual Lilith, along with Bagdana &quot;king of the lilits&quot;, is one of the demons to feature prominently in protective spells in the eighty surviving Jewish occult incantation bowls from Sassanid Empire Babylon (4th–6th century AD) with influence from Iranian culture.[47] These bowls were buried upside down below the structure of the house or on the land of the house, in order to trap the demon or demoness. Almost every house was found to have such protective bowls against demons and demonesses.

The centre of the inside of the bowl depicts Lilith, or the male form, Lilit. Surrounding the image is writing in spiral form; the writing often begins at the centre and works its way to the edge. The writing is most commonly scripture or references to the Talmud. The incantation bowls which have been analysed, are inscribed in the following languages, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Syriac, Mandaic, Middle Persian, and Arabic. Some bowls are written in a false script which has no meaning.

The correctly worded incantation bowl was capable of warding off Lilith or Lilit from the household. Lilith had the power to transform into a woman&#x27;s physical features, seduce her husband, and conceive a child. However, Lilith would become hateful toward the children born of the husband and wife and would seek to kill them. Similarly, Lilit would transform into the physical features of the husband, seduce the wife, she would give birth to a child. It would become evident that the child was not fathered by the husband, and the child would be looked down on. Lilit would seek revenge on the family by killing the children born to the husband and wife.

Key features of the depiction of Lilith or Lilit include the following. The figure is often depicted with arms and legs chained, indicating the control of the family over the demon(ess). The demon(ess) is depicted in a frontal position with the whole face showing. The eyes are very large, as well as the hands (if depicted). The demon(ess) is entirely static.

One bowl contains the following inscription commissioned from a Jewish occultist to protect a woman called Rashnoi and her husband from Lilith:

=== Alphabet of Ben Sira ===

The pseudepigraphical 8th–10th centuries &quot;Alphabet of Ben Sira&quot; is considered to be the oldest form of the story of Lilith as Adam&#x27;s first wife. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known. Scholars tend to date the Alphabet between the 8th and 10th centuries AD. The work has been characterized by some scholars as satirical, but Ginzberg concluded it was meant seriously.

In the text, an amulet is inscribed with the names of three angels (Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof) and placed around the neck of newborn boys in order to protect them from the lilin until their circumcision. The amulets used against Lilith that were thought to derive from this tradition are, in fact, dated as being much older. The concept of Eve having a predecessor is not exclusive to the Alphabet, and is not a new concept, as it can be found in Genesis Rabbah. However, the idea that Lilith was the predecessor may be exclusive to the Alphabet.

The idea in the text that Adam had a wife prior to Eve may have developed from an interpretation of the Book of Genesis and its dual creation accounts; while Genesis 2:22 describes God&#x27;s creation of Eve from Adam&#x27;s rib, an earlier passage, 1:27, already indicates that a woman had been made: &quot;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.&quot; The Alphabet text places Lilith&#x27;s creation after God&#x27;s words in Genesis 2:18 that &quot;it is not good for man to be alone&quot;; in this text God forms Lilith out of the clay from which he made Adam but she and Adam bicker. Lilith claims that since she and Adam were created in the same way they were equal and she refuses to submit to him:

After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, &quot;It is not good for man to be alone.&quot; He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, &quot;I will not lie below,&quot; and he said, &quot;I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.&quot; Lilith responded, &quot;We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.&quot; But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.

Adam stood in prayer before his Creator: &quot;Sovereign of the universe!&quot; he said, &quot;the woman you gave me has run away.&quot; At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof, to bring her back.

Said the Holy One to Adam, &quot;If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.&quot; The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God&#x27;s word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, &quot;We shall drown you in the sea.&quot;

&quot;Leave me!&#x27; she said. &quot;I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.&quot;

When the angels heard Lilith&#x27;s words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: &quot;Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.&quot; She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels&#x27; names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.

The background and purpose of &quot;The Alphabet of Ben-Sira&quot; is unclear. It is a collection of stories about heroes of the Bible and Talmud, it may have been a collection of folk-tales, a refutation of Christian, Karaite, or other separatist movements; its content seems so offensive to contemporary Jews that it was even suggested that it could be an anti-Jewish satire, although, in any case, the text was accepted by the Jewish mystics of medieval Germany.

&quot;The Alphabet of Ben-Sira&quot; is the earliest surviving source of the story, and the conception that Lilith was Adam&#x27;s first wife became only widely known with the 17th century &quot;Lexicon Talmudicum&quot; of German scholar Johannes Buxtorf.

In this folk tradition that arose in the early Middle Ages, Lilith, a dominant female demon, became identified with Asmodeus, King of Demons, as his queen. Asmodeus was already well known by this time because of the legends about him in the Talmud. Thus, the merging of Lilith and Asmodeus was inevitable. The second myth of Lilith grew to include legends about another world and by some accounts this other world existed side by side with this one, &quot;Yenne Velt&quot; is Yiddish for this described &quot;Other World&quot;. In this case Asmodeus and Lilith were believed to procreate demonic offspring endlessly and spread chaos at every turn.

Two primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates. These two aspects of the Lilith legend seemed to have evolved separately; there is hardly a tale where she encompasses both roles. But the aspect of the witch-like role that Lilith plays broadens her archetype of the destructive side of witchcraft. Such stories are commonly found among Jewish folklore.

==== The influence of the rabbinic traditions ====
Although the image of Lilith of the &quot;Alphabet of Ben Sira&quot; is unprecedented, some elements in her portrayal can be traced back to the talmudic and midrashic traditions that arose around Eve.

First and foremost, the very introduction of Lilith to the creation story rests on the rabbinic myth, prompted by the two separate creation accounts in Genesis 1:1–2:25, that there were two original women. A way of resolving the apparent discrepancy between these two accounts was to assume that there must have been some other first woman, apart from the one later identified with Eve. The Rabbis, noting Adam&#x27;s exclamation, &quot;this time (&quot;zot hapa‘am&quot;) [this is] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh&quot; (Genesis 2:23), took it as an intimation that there must already have been a &quot;first time&quot;. According to Genesis rabbah 18:4, Adam was disgusted upon seeing the first woman full of &quot;discharge and blood&quot;, and God had to provide him with another one. The subsequent creation is performed with adequate precautions: Adam is made to sleep, so as not to witness the process itself (Sanhedrin 39a), and Eve is adorned with fine jewellery (Genesis rabbah 18:1) and brought to Adam by the angels Gabriel and Michael (ibid. 18:3). However, nowhere do the rabbis specify what happened to the first woman, leaving the matter open for further speculation. This is the gap into which the later tradition of Lilith could fit.

Second, this new woman is still met with harsh rabbinic allegations. Again playing on the Hebrew phrase , Adam, according to the same midrash, declares: &quot;it is she [&quot;zot&quot;] who is destined to strike the bell [&quot;zog&quot;] and to speak [in strife] against me, as you read, &#x27;a golden bell [&quot;pa‘amon&quot;] and a pomegranate&#x27; [Exodus 28:34] ... it is she who will trouble me [&quot;mefa‘amtani&quot;] all night&quot; (Genesis Rabbah 18:4). The first woman also becomes the object of accusations ascribed to Rabbi Joshua of Siknin, according to whom Eve, despite the divine efforts, turned out to be &quot;swelled-headed, coquette, eavesdropper, gossip, prone to jealousy, light-fingered and gadabout&quot; (Genesis Rabbah 18:2). A similar set of charges appears in Genesis Rabbah 17:8, according to which Eve&#x27;s creation from Adam&#x27;s rib rather than from the earth makes her inferior to Adam and never satisfied with anything.

Third, and despite the terseness of the biblical text in this regard, the erotic iniquities attributed to Eve constitute a separate category of her shortcomings. Told in Genesis 3:16 that &quot;your desire shall be for your husband&quot;, she is accused by the Rabbis of having an overdeveloped sexual drive (Genesis Rabbah 20:7) and constantly enticing Adam (Genesis Rabbah 23:5). However, in terms of textual popularity and dissemination, the motif of Eve copulating with the primeval serpent takes priority over her other sexual transgressions. Despite the rather unsettling picturesqueness of this account, it is conveyed in numerous places: Genesis Rabbah 18:6, and BT Sotah 9b, Shabbat 145b–146a and 156a, Yevamot 103b and Avodah Zarah 22b.

=== Kabbalah ===

Kabbalistic mysticism attempted to establish a more exact relationship between Lilith and God. With her major characteristics having been well developed by the end of the Talmudic period, after six centuries had elapsed between the Aramaic incantation texts that mention Lilith and the early Spanish Kabbalistic writings in the 13th century, she reappears, and her life history becomes known in greater mythological detail. Her creation is described in many alternative versions.

One mentions her creation as being before Adam&#x27;s, on the fifth day, because the &quot;living creatures&quot; with whose swarms God filled the waters included Lilith. A similar version, related to the earlier Talmudic passages, recounts how Lilith was fashioned with the same substance as Adam was, shortly before. A third alternative version states that God originally created Adam and Lilith in a manner that the female creature was contained in the male. Lilith&#x27;s soul was lodged in the depths of the Great Abyss. When God called her, she joined Adam. After Adam&#x27;s body was created a thousand souls from the Left (evil) side attempted to attach themselves to him. However, God drove them off. Adam was left lying as a body without a soul. Then a cloud descended and God commanded the earth to produce a living soul. This God breathed into Adam, who began to spring to life and his female was attached to his side. God separated the female from Adam&#x27;s side. The female side was Lilith, whereupon she flew to the Cities of the Sea and attacked humankind.

Yet another version claims that Lilith emerged as a divine entity that was born spontaneously, either out of the Great Supernal Abyss or out of the power of an aspect of God (the Gevurah of Din). This aspect of God was negative and punitive, as well as one of his ten attributes (Sefirot), at its lowest manifestation has an affinity with the realm of evil and it is out of this that Lilith merged with Samael.

An alternative story links Lilith with the creation of luminaries. The &quot;first light&quot;, which is the light of Mercy (one of the Sefirot), appeared on the first day of creation when God said &quot;Let there be light&quot;. This light became hidden and the Holiness became surrounded by a husk of evil. &quot;A husk (klippa) was created around the brain&quot; and this husk spread and brought out another husk, which was Lilith.

==== Midrash ABKIR ====
The first medieval source to depict Adam and Lilith in full was the Midrash A.B.K.I.R. (c. 10th century), which was followed by the Zohar and other Kabbalistic writings. Adam is said to be perfect until he recognises either his sin or Cain&#x27;s fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world. He then separates from holy Eve, sleeps alone, and fasts for 130 years. During this time &quot;Pizna&quot;, either an alternate name for Lilith or a daughter of hers, desires his beauty and seduces him against his will. She gives birth to multitudes of djinns and demons, the first of them being named Agrimas. However, they are defeated by Methuselah, who slays thousands of them with a holy sword and forces Agrimas to give him the names of the rest, after which he casts them away to the sea and the mountains.

==== Treatise on the Left Emanation ====

The mystical writing of two brothers Jacob and Isaac Hacohen, &quot;Treatise on the Left Emanation&quot;, which predates the Zohar by a few decades, states that Samael and Lilith are in the shape of an androgynous being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the Throne of Glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to Adam and Eve, who were likewise born as a hermaphrodite. The two twin androgynous couples resembled each other and both &quot;were like the image of Above&quot;; that is, that they are reproduced in a visible form of an androgynous deity.

19. In answer to your question concerning Lilith, I shall explain to you the essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces.

Another version that was also current among Kabbalistic circles in the Middle Ages establishes Lilith as the first of Samael&#x27;s four wives: Lilith, Naamah, Eisheth, and Agrat bat Mahlat. Each of them are mothers of demons and have their own hosts and unclean spirits in no number. The marriage of archangel Samael and Lilith was arranged by Tanin&#x27;iver (&quot;Blind Dragon&quot;), who is the counterpart of &quot;the dragon that is in the sea&quot;. Blind Dragon acts as an intermediary between Lilith and Samael:

Blind Dragon rides Lilith the Sinful – may she be extirpated quickly in our days, Amen! – And this Blind Dragon brings about the union between Samael and Lilith. And just as &quot;the Dragon that is in the sea&quot; (Isa. 27:1) has no eyes, likewise Blind Dragon that is above, in the likeness of a spiritual form, is without eyes, that is to say, without colors... (Patai 81:458) Samael is called the Slant Serpent, and Lilith is called the Tortuous Serpent.

The marriage of Samael and Lilith is known as the &quot;Angel Satan&quot; or the &quot;Other God&quot;, but it was not allowed to last. To prevent Lilith and Samael&#x27;s demonic children &quot;Lilin&quot; from filling the world, God castrated Samael. In many 17th century Kabbalistic books, this seems to be a reinterpretation of an old Talmudic myth where God castrated the male Leviathan and slew the female Leviathan in order to prevent them from mating and thereby destroying the Earth with their offspring. With Lilith being unable to fornicate with Samael anymore, she sought to couple with men who experience nocturnal emissions. A 15th or 16th century Kabbalah text states that God has &quot;cooled&quot; the female Leviathan, meaning that he has made Lilith infertile and she is a mere fornication.

The &quot;Treatise on the Left Emanation&quot; also says that there are two Liliths, the lesser being married to the great demon Asmodeus.

The Matron Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were born at the same hour in the image of Adam and Eve, intertwined in each other. Asmodeus the great king of the demons has as a mate the Lesser (younger) Lilith, daughter of the king whose name is Qafsefoni. The name of his mate is Mehetabel daughter of Matred, and their daughter is Lilith.

Another passage charges Lilith as being a tempting serpent of Eve.
And the Serpent, the Woman of Harlotry, incited and seduced Eve through the husks of Light which in itself is holiness. And the Serpent seduced Holy Eve, and enough said for him who understands. And all this ruination came about because Adam the first man coupled with Eve while she was in her menstrual impurity – this is the filth and the impure seed of the Serpent who mounted Eve before Adam mounted her. Behold, here it is before you: because of the sins of Adam the first man all the things mentioned came into being. For Evil Lilith, when she saw the greatness of his corruption, became strong in her husks, and came to Adam against his will, and became hot from him and bore him many demons and spirits and Lilin. (Patai81:455f)
==== Zohar ====
References to Lilith in the Zohar include the following:

She roams at night, and goes all about the world and makes sport with men and causes them to emit seed. In every place where a man sleeps alone in a house, she visits him and grabs him and attaches herself to him and has her desire from him, and bears from him. And she also afflicts him with sickness, and he knows it not, and all this takes place when the moon is on the wane.

This passage may be related to the mention of Lilith in Talmud Shabbath 151b (see above), and also to Talmud Eruvin 18b where nocturnal emissions are connected with the begettal of demons.

According to Rapahel Patai, older sources state clearly that after Lilith&#x27;s Red Sea sojourn (mentioned also in Louis Ginzberg&#x27;s &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;), she returned to Adam and begat children from him by forcing herself upon him. Before doing so, she attaches herself to Cain and bears him numerous spirits and demons. In the Zohar, however, Lilith is said to have succeeded in begetting offspring from Adam even during their short-lived sexual experience. Lilith leaves Adam in Eden, as she is not a suitable helpmate for him. Gershom Scholem proposes that the author of the Zohar, Rabbi Moses de Leon, was aware of both the folk tradition of Lilith and another conflicting version, possibly older.

The Zohar adds further that two female spirits instead of one, Lilith and Naamah, desired Adam and seduced him. The issue of these unions were demons and spirits called &quot;the plagues of humankind&quot;, and the usual added explanation was that it was through Adam&#x27;s own sin that Lilith overcame him against his will.

=== 17th-century Hebrew magical amulets ===
A copy of Jean de Pauly&#x27;s translation of the Zohar in the Ritman Library contains an inserted late 17th century printed Hebrew sheet for use in magical amulets where the prophet Elijah confronts Lilith.

The sheet contains two texts within borders, which are amulets, one for a male (&#x27;lazakhar&#x27;), the other one for a female (&#x27;lanekevah&#x27;). The invocations mention Adam, Eve and Lilith, &#x27;Chavah Rishonah&#x27; (the first Eve, who is identical with Lilith), also devils or angels: Sanoy, Sansinoy, Smangeluf, Shmari&#x27;el (the guardian) and Hasdi&#x27;el (the merciful). A few lines in Yiddish are followed by the dialogue between the prophet Elijah and Lilith when he met her with her host of demons to kill the mother and take her new-born child (&#x27;to drink her blood, suck her bones and eat her flesh&#x27;). She tells Elijah that she will lose her power if someone uses her secret names, which she reveals at the end: &quot;lilith, abitu, abizu, hakash, avers hikpodu, ayalu, matrota ...&quot;

In other amulets, probably informed by &quot;The Alphabet of Ben-Sira&quot;, she is Adam&#x27;s first wife. (Yalqut Reubeni, Zohar 1:34b, 3:19)

Charles Richardson&#x27;s dictionary portion of the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot; appends to his etymological discussion of &quot;lullaby&quot; &quot;a [manuscript] note written in a copy of Skinner&quot; [i.e. Stephen Skinner&#x27;s 1671 &quot;Etymologicon Linguæ Anglicanæ&quot;], which asserts that the word &quot;lullaby&quot; originates from , a Hebrew incantation meaning &quot;Lilith begone&quot; recited by Jewish mothers over an infant&#x27;s cradle. Richardson did not endorse the theory and modern lexicographers consider it a false etymology.

=== Alsatian Krasmesser (16th to 20th century) ===
Not so much an amulet as a ritual object for protection, the &quot;Krasmesser&quot; (or &quot;Kreismesser&quot;, circle knife) played a role in Jewish birth rituals in the area of Alsace, Switzerland and Southern Germany between the 16th and 20th century. The Krasmesser would be used by a midwife or by the husband to draw a magic circle around the pregnant or birthing woman to protect her from Lilith and the evil eye, which were considered to represent the greatest danger for children and pregnant women.

Rabbi Naphtali Hirsch ben Elieser Treves described this custom as early as 1560, and later references to a knife or sword by the birthing bed by both Paul Christian Kirchner and Johann Christian Georg Bodenschatz indicate its continuance. A publication about birth customs by the Jewish Museum of Switzerland also includes oral accounts from 20th century Baden-Württemberg which likewise mention circling movements with a knife in order to protect a woman in childbirth.

== Greco-Roman mythology ==

In the Latin Vulgate Book of Isaiah 34:14, Lilith is translated &quot;lamia&quot;.

According to Augustine Calmet, Lilith has connections with early views on vampires and sorcery:

According to Siegmund Hurwitz the Talmudic Lilith is connected with the Greek Lamia, who, according to Hurwitz, likewise governed a class of child stealing lamia-demons. Lamia bore the title &quot;child killer&quot; and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith. She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body from the waist up and a serpentine body from the waist down. One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess Hecate, another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia&#x27;s children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them. Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men&#x27;s blood. Her gift was the &quot;mark of a Sibyl&quot;, a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was &quot;cursed&quot; to never be able to shut her eyes so that she would forever obsess over her dead children. Taking pity on Lamia, Zeus gave her the ability to remove and replace her eyes from their sockets.

== In Mandaeism ==
In Mandaean scriptures such as the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; and &quot;Qulasta&quot;, liliths () are mentioned as inhabitants of the World of Darkness.

== Arabic culture ==
The occult writer Ahmad al-Buni (d. 1225), in his &quot;Sun of the Great Knowledge&quot; (), mentions a demon called &quot;the mother of children&quot; (ام الصبيان), a term also used &quot;in one place&quot;.
Folkloric traditions recorded around 1953 tell about a jinn called &quot;Qarinah&quot;, who was rejected by Adam and mated with Iblis instead. She gave birth to a host of demons and became known as their mother. To take revenge on Adam, she pursues human children. As such, she would kill a pregnant mother&#x27;s baby in the womb, causes impotence to men or attacks little children with illnesses. According to occult practises, she would be subject to the demon-king &quot;Murrah al-Abyad&quot;, which appears to be another name for Iblis used in magical writings. Stories about Qarinah and Lilith merged in early Islam.

== In Western media ==
=== In German media ===

Lilith&#x27;s earliest appearance in the literature of the Romantic period (1789–1832) was in Goethe&#x27;s 1808 work &quot;&quot;.

After Mephistopheles offers this warning to Faust, he then, quite ironically, encourages Faust to dance with &quot;the Pretty Witch&quot;. Lilith and Faust engage in a short dialogue, where Lilith recounts the days spent in Eden.

=== In English media ===

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which developed around 1848, were greatly influenced by Goethe&#x27;s work on the theme of Lilith. In 1863, Dante Gabriel Rossetti of the Brotherhood began painting what would later be his first rendition of &quot;Lady Lilith&quot;, a painting he expected to be his &quot;best picture hitherto&quot;. Symbols appearing in the painting allude to the &quot;femme fatale&quot; reputation of the Romantic Lilith: poppies (death and cold) and white roses (sterile passion). Accompanying his &quot;Lady Lilith&quot; painting from 1866, Rossetti wrote a sonnet entitled &quot;Lilith&quot;, which was first published in Swinburne&#x27;s pamphlet-review (1868), &quot;Notes on the Royal Academy Exhibition&quot;.

The poem and the picture appeared together alongside Rossetti&#x27;s painting &quot;Sibylla Palmifera&quot; and the sonnet &quot;Soul&#x27;s Beauty&quot;. In 1881, the &quot;Lilith&quot; sonnet was renamed &quot;Body&#x27;s Beauty&quot; in order to contrast it and &quot;Soul&#x27;s Beauty&quot;. The two were placed sequentially in &quot;The House of Life&quot; collection (sonnets number 77 and 78).

Rossetti wrote in 1870:
This is in accordance with Jewish folk tradition, which associates Lilith both with long hair (a symbol of dangerous feminine seductive power in Jewish culture), and with possessing women by entering them through mirrors.

The Victorian poet Robert Browning re-envisioned Lilith in his poem &quot;Adam, Lilith, and Eve&quot;. First published in 1883, the poem uses the traditional myths surrounding the triad of Adam, Eve, and Lilith. Browning depicts Lilith and Eve as being friendly and complicitous with each other, as they sit together on either side of Adam. Under the threat of death, Eve admits that she never loved Adam, while Lilith confesses that she always loved him:

Browning focused on Lilith&#x27;s emotional attributes, rather than that of her ancient demon predecessors.

Scottish author George MacDonald also wrote a fantasy novel entitled &quot;Lilith&quot;, first published in 1895. MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology are present in the author&#x27;s depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing at herself in a mirror. MacDonald&#x27;s Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.

Australian poet and scholar Christopher John Brennan (1870–1932), included a section titled &quot;Lilith&quot; in his major work &quot;Poems: 1913&quot; (Sydney: G. B. Philip and Son, 1914). The &quot;Lilith&quot; section contains thirteen poems exploring the Lilith myth and is central to the meaning of the collection as a whole.

C. L. Moore&#x27;s 1940 story &quot;Fruit of Knowledge&quot; is written from Lilith&#x27;s point of view. It is a re-telling of the Fall of Man as a love triangle between Lilith, Adam and Eve – with Eve&#x27;s eating the forbidden fruit being in this version the result of misguided manipulations by the jealous Lilith, who had hoped to get her rival discredited and destroyed by God and thus regain Adam&#x27;s love.

British poet John Siddique&#x27;s 2011 collection &quot;Full Blood&quot; has a suite of 11 poems called &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, which features Lilith as the divine feminine aspect of God. A number of the poems feature Lilith directly, including the piece &quot;Unwritten&quot; which deals with the spiritual problem of the feminine being removed by the scribes from &quot;The Bible.&quot;

Lilith is also mentioned in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, by C. S. Lewis. The character Mr. Beaver ascribes the ancestry of the main antagonist, Jadis the White Witch, to Lilith.

&quot;Lilith&quot; is a poem by Vladimir Nabokov, written in 1928. Many have connected it to Lolita, but Nabokov adamantly denies this: &quot;Intelligent readers will abstain from examining this impersonal fantasy for any links with my later fiction.&quot;

===In American media===
&quot;Lilith: A Dramatic Poem&quot; is a four-act medieval fantasy verse drama written in blank verse by American poet and playwright George Sterling, first published in 1919. Influential critic H. L. Mencken said of Sterling: &quot;I think his dramatic poem &quot;Lilith&quot; was the greatest thing he ever wrote.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; declared &quot;Lilith&quot; &quot;the finest thing in poetic drama yet done in America and one of the finest poetic dramas yet written in English.&quot; Author Theodore Dreiser said: &quot;It rings richer in thought than any American dramatic poem with which I am familiar.&quot; Poet Clark Ashton Smith wrote: &quot;&quot;Lilith&quot; is certainly the best dramatic poem in English since the days of Swinburne and Browning. ... The lyrics interspersed throughout the drama are as beautiful as any by the Elizabethans.&quot;

In the role playing game series &quot;Vampire the Masquerade&quot;, Lilith plays a major part in the mythology within the games.

&quot;Lilith&quot; is a 1961 novel by J. R. Salamanca that tells the story of a man, Vincent, who is seduced by a schizophrenic woman named Lilith. It explores themes of love, obsession, and blurred lines between fantasy and reality. A feature film of the same name written by Robert Rossen and starring Jean Seberg and Warren Beatty was released in 1964.

In the 2019 adult animated series &quot;Hazbin Hotel&quot;, Lilith is depicted as the wife of Lucifer and the queen of Hell. Charlie, the protagonist of the series, is Lilith&#x27;s daughter. According to &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;Hazbin Hotel&quot; subverts traditional narratives of Lucifer and Lilith by presenting their betrayal of God as heroic and noble.

In the Diablo series of video games, Lilith is depicted as the daughter of Mephisto and the creator of the games world alongside her lover, the angel Inarius. Lilith serves as the main antagonist in Diablo IV.

==In Western esotericism==
The depiction of Lilith in Romanticism continues to be popular among Wiccans and in other modern occultism. A few magical orders dedicated to the undercurrent of Lilith, featuring initiations specifically related to the arcana of the &quot;first mother&quot;, exist. Two organisations that use initiations and magic associated with Lilith are the Ordo Antichristianus Illuminati and the Order of Phosphorus. Lilith appears as a succubus in Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;De Arte Magica.&quot; Lilith was also one of the middle names of Crowley&#x27;s first child, Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith Crowley (1904–1906), and Lilith is sometimes identified with Babalon in Thelemic writings. Many early occult writers who contributed to modern day Wicca expressed special reverence for Lilith. Charles Leland associated Aradia with Lilith: Aradia, says Leland, is Herodias, who was regarded in stregheria folklore as being associated with Diana as chief of the witches. Leland further notes that Herodias is a name that comes from west Asia, where it denoted an early form of Lilith.

Gerald Gardner asserted that there was continuous historical worship of Lilith to present day, and that her name is sometimes given to the goddess being personified in the coven by the priestess. This idea was further attested by Doreen Valiente, who cited her as a presiding goddess of the Craft: &quot;the personification of erotic dreams, the suppressed desire for delights&quot;. In some contemporary concepts, &quot;Lilith&quot; is viewed as the embodiment of the Goddess, a designation that is thought to be shared with what these faiths believe to be her counterparts: Inanna, Ishtar, Asherah, Anath, Anahita and Isis. According to one view, Lilith was originally a Sumerian, Babylonian, or Hebrew mother goddess of childbirth, children, women, and sexuality.

Raymond Buckland holds that Lilith is a dark moon goddess on par with the Hindu Kali.

Many theistic Satanists consider Lilith a goddess. She is considered a goddess of independence by those Satanists and is often worshipped by women, but women are not the only people who worship her. Lilith is popular among theistic Satanists because of her association with Satan. Some Satanists believe that she is married to Satan and thus think of her as a mother figure. Others base their reverence for her on her history as a succubus and praise her as a sex goddess. A different approach to a Satanic Lilith holds that she was once a fertility and agricultural goddess.

The Western mystery tradition associates Lilith with the qlippoth of Kabbalah. Dion Fortune writes, &quot;The Virgin Mary is reflected in Lilith&quot;, and that Lilith is the source of &quot;lustful dreams&quot;.

<text>In physics, specifically in electromagnetism, the Lorentz force law is the combination of electric and magnetic force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. The Lorentz force, on the other hand, is a physical effect that occurs in the vicinity of electrically neutral, current-carrying conductors causing moving electrical charges to experience a magnetic force.

The Lorentz force law states that a particle of charge moving with a velocity in an electric field and a magnetic field experiences a force (in SI units) of
formula_1
It says that the electromagnetic force on a charge is a combination of (1) a force in the direction of the electric field (proportional to the magnitude of the field and the quantity of charge), and (2) a force at right angles to both the magnetic field and the velocity of the charge (proportional to the magnitude of the field, the charge, and the velocity).

Variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire (sometimes called Laplace force), the electromotive force in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field (an aspect of Faraday&#x27;s law of induction), and the force on a moving charged particle.

Historians suggest that the law is implicit in a paper by James Clerk Maxwell, published in 1865. Hendrik Lorentz arrived at a complete derivation in 1895, identifying the contribution of the electric force a few years after Oliver Heaviside correctly identified the contribution of the magnetic force.

== Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B ==

In many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force law is used as the &quot;definition&quot; of the electric and magnetic fields and . To be specific, the Lorentz force is understood to be the following empirical statement:

This is valid, even for particles approaching the speed of light (that is, magnitude of , ). So the two vector fields and are thereby defined throughout space and time, and these are called the &quot;electric field&quot; and &quot;magnetic field&quot;. The fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force.

== Physical interpretation of the Lorentz force ==

Coulomb&#x27;s law is only valid for point charges at rest. In fact, the electromagnetic force between two point charges depends not only on the distance but also on the relative velocity. For small relative velocities and very small accelerations, instead of the Coulomb force, the Weber force can be applied. The sum of the Weber forces of all charge carriers in a closed DC loop on a single test charge produces – regardless of the shape of the current loop – the Lorentz force.

The interpretation of magnetism by means of a modified Coulomb law was first proposed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. In 1835, Gauss assumed that each segment of a DC loop contains an equal number of negative and positive point charges that move at different speeds. If Coulomb&#x27;s law were completely correct, no force should act between any two short segments of such current loops. However, around 1825, André-Marie Ampère demonstrated experimentally that this is not the case. Ampère also formulated a force law. Based on this law, Gauss concluded that the electromagnetic force between two point charges depends not only on the distance but also on the relative velocity.

The Weber force is a central force and complies with Newton&#x27;s third law. This demonstrates not only the conservation of momentum but also that the conservation of energy and the conservation of angular momentum apply. Weber electrodynamics is only a quasistatic approximation, i.e. it should not be used for higher velocities and accelerations. However, the Weber force illustrates that the Lorentz force can be traced back to central forces between numerous point-like charge carriers.

== Equation ==

=== Charged particle ===

The force acting on a particle of electric charge with instantaneous velocity , due to an external electric field and magnetic field , is given by (SI definition of quantities):

where is the vector cross product (all boldface quantities are vectors). In terms of Cartesian components, we have:
formula_2

In general, the electric and magnetic fields are functions of the position and time. Therefore, explicitly, the Lorentz force can be written as:
formula_3
in which is the position vector of the charged particle, is time, and the overdot is a time derivative.

A positively charged particle will be accelerated in the &quot;same&quot; linear orientation as the field, but will curve perpendicularly to both the instantaneous velocity vector and the field according to the right-hand rule (in detail, if the fingers of the right hand are extended to point in the direction of and are then curled to point in the direction of , then the extended thumb will point in the direction of ).

The term is called the electric force, while the term is called the magnetic force. According to some definitions, the term &quot;Lorentz force&quot; refers specifically to the formula for the magnetic force, with the &quot;total&quot; electromagnetic force (including the electric force) given some other (nonstandard) name. This article will &quot;not&quot; follow this nomenclature: in what follows, the term &quot;Lorentz force&quot; will refer to the expression for the total force.

The magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the Laplace force.

The Lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle, that is, it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. Associated with it is the power which is the rate at which energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. That power is
formula_4
Notice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.

=== Continuous charge distribution ===

For a continuous charge distribution in motion, the Lorentz force equation becomes:
formula_5
where formula_6 is the force on a small piece of the charge distribution with charge formula_7. If both sides of this equation are divided by the volume of this small piece of the charge distribution formula_8, the result is:
formula_9
where formula_10 is the &quot;force density&quot; (force per unit volume) and formula_11 is the charge density (charge per unit volume). Next, the current density corresponding to the motion of the charge continuum is
formula_12
so the continuous analogue to the equation is

The total force is the volume integral over the charge distribution:
formula_13

By eliminating formula_11 and formula_15, using Maxwell&#x27;s equations, and manipulating using the theorems of vector calculus, this form of the equation can be used to derive the Maxwell stress tensor formula_16, in turn this can be combined with the Poynting vector formula_17 to obtain the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor used in general relativity.

In terms of formula_16 and formula_17, another way to write the Lorentz force (per unit volume) is
formula_20
where formula_21 is the speed of light and ∇· (nabla followed by a middle dot) denotes the divergence of a tensor field. Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the energy flux (flow of &quot;energy&quot; per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism for more details.

The density of power associated with the Lorentz force in a material medium is
formula_22

If we separate the total charge and total current into their free and bound parts, we get that the density of the Lorentz force is
formula_23

where: formula_24 is the density of free charge; formula_25 is the polarization density; formula_26 is the density of free current; and formula_27 is the magnetization density. In this way, the Lorentz force can explain the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field. The density of the associated power is
formula_28

=== Formulation in the Gaussian system ===
The above-mentioned formulae use the conventions for the definition of the electric and magnetic field used with the SI, which is the most common. However, other conventions with the same physics (i.e. forces on e.g. an electron) are possible and used. In the conventions used with the older CGS-Gaussian units, which are somewhat more common among some theoretical physicists as well as condensed matter experimentalists, one has instead
formula_29
where is the speed of light. Although this equation looks slightly different, it is equivalent, since one has the following relations:
formula_30
where is the vacuum permittivity and the vacuum permeability. In practice, the subscripts &quot;G&quot; and &quot;SI&quot; are omitted, and the used convention (and unit) must be determined from context.

== History ==

Early attempts to quantitatively describe the electromagnetic force were made in the mid-18th century. It was proposed that the force on magnetic poles, by Johann Tobias Mayer and others in 1760, and electrically charged objects, by Henry Cavendish in 1762, obeyed an inverse-square law. However, in both cases the experimental proof was neither complete nor conclusive. It was not until 1784 when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, using a torsion balance, was able to definitively show through experiment that this was true. Soon after the discovery in 1820 by Hans Christian Ørsted that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, André-Marie Ampère that same year was able to devise through experimentation the formula for the angular dependence of the force between two current elements. In all these descriptions, the force was always described in terms of the properties of the matter involved and the distances between two masses or charges rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields.

The modern concept of electric and magnetic fields first arose in the theories of Michael Faraday, particularly his idea of lines of force, later to be given full mathematical description by Lord Kelvin and James Clerk Maxwell. From a modern perspective it is possible to identify in Maxwell&#x27;s 1865 formulation of his field equations a form of the Lorentz force equation in relation to electric currents, although in the time of Maxwell it was not evident how his equations related to the forces on moving charged objects. J. J. Thomson was the first to attempt to derive from Maxwell&#x27;s field equations the electromagnetic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the object&#x27;s properties and external fields. Interested in determining the electromagnetic behavior of the charged particles in cathode rays, Thomson published a paper in 1881 wherein he gave the force on the particles due to an external magnetic field as
formula_31
Thomson derived the correct basic form of the formula, but, because of some miscalculations and an incomplete description of the displacement current, included an incorrect scale-factor of a half in front of the formula. Oliver Heaviside invented the modern vector notation and applied it to Maxwell&#x27;s field equations; he also (in 1885 and 1889) had fixed the mistakes of Thomson&#x27;s derivation and arrived at the correct form of the magnetic force on a moving charged object. Finally, in 1895, Hendrik Lorentz derived the modern form of the formula for the electromagnetic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the magnetic fields. Lorentz began by abandoning the Maxwellian descriptions of the ether and conduction. Instead, Lorentz made a distinction between matter and the luminiferous aether and sought to apply the Maxwell equations at a microscopic scale. Using Heaviside&#x27;s version of the Maxwell equations for a stationary ether and applying Lagrangian mechanics (see below), Lorentz arrived at the correct and complete form of the force law that now bears his name.

== Trajectories of particles due to the Lorentz force ==
In many cases of practical interest, the motion in a magnetic field of an electrically charged particle (such as an electron or ion in a plasma) can be treated as the superposition of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the guiding center and a relatively slow drift of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.

== Significance of the Lorentz force ==

While the modern Maxwell&#x27;s equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge in the presence of electromagnetic fields. The Lorentz force law describes the effect of and upon a point charge, but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture. Charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces, notably gravity and nuclear forces. Thus, Maxwell&#x27;s equations do not stand separate from other physical laws, but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities. The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect; the generation of and by currents and charges is another.

In real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle and as a matter of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the and fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the Boltzmann equation or the Fokker–Planck equation or the Navier–Stokes equations. For example, see magnetohydrodynamics, fluid dynamics, electrohydrodynamics, superconductivity, stellar evolution. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, Green–Kubo relations and Green&#x27;s function (many-body theory).

== Force on a current-carrying wire ==

When a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the Laplace force). By combining the Lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current, the following equation results, in the case of a straight stationary wire in a homogeneous field:
formula_32
where is a vector whose magnitude is the length of the wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of the conventional current .

If the wire is not straight, the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each infinitesimal segment of wire formula_33, then adding up all these forces by integration. This results in the same formal expression, but should now be understood as the vector connecting the end points of the curved wire with direction from starting to end point of conventional current. Usually, there will also be a net torque.

If, in addition, the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, the net force on a stationary rigid wire carrying a steady current is given by integration along the wire,
formula_34

One application of this is Ampère&#x27;s force law, which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other&#x27;s magnetic field.

== EMF ==

The magnetic force () component of the Lorentz force is responsible for &quot;motional&quot; electromotive force (or &quot;motional EMF&quot;), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term &quot;motional EMF&quot; is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF is due to the &quot;motion&quot; of the wire.

In other electrical generators, the magnets move, while the conductors do not. In this case, the EMF is due to the electric force () term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an &quot;induced&quot; EMF, as described by the Maxwell–Faraday equation (one of the four modern Maxwell&#x27;s equations).

Both of these EMFs, despite their apparently distinct origins, are described by the same equation, namely, the EMF is the rate of change of magnetic flux through the wire. (This is Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, see below.) Einstein&#x27;s special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects. In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the solenoidal vector field portion of the -field can change in whole or in part to a -field or &quot;vice versa&quot;.

== Lorentz force and Faraday&#x27;s law of induction ==
Given a loop of wire in a magnetic field, Faraday&#x27;s law of induction states the induced electromotive force (EMF) in the wire is:
formula_35
where
formula_36
is the magnetic flux through the loop, is the magnetic field, is a surface bounded by the closed contour , at time , is an infinitesimal vector area element of (magnitude is the area of an infinitesimal patch of surface, direction is orthogonal to that surface patch).

The &quot;sign&quot; of the EMF is determined by Lenz&#x27;s law. Note that this is valid for not only a &quot;stationary&quot; wirebut also for a &quot;moving&quot; wire.

From Faraday&#x27;s law of induction (that is valid for a moving wire, for instance in a motor) and the Maxwell Equations, the Lorentz Force can be deduced. The reverse is also true, the Lorentz force and the Maxwell Equations can be used to derive the Faraday Law.

Let be the moving wire, moving together without rotation and with constant velocity and be the internal surface of the wire. The EMF around the closed path is given by:
formula_37
where formula_38 is the electric field and is an infinitesimal vector element of the contour .

NB: Both and have a sign ambiguity; to get the correct sign, the right-hand rule is used, as explained in the article Kelvin–Stokes theorem.

The above result can be compared with the version of Faraday&#x27;s law of induction that appears in the modern Maxwell&#x27;s equations, called here the &quot;Maxwell–Faraday equation&quot;:
formula_39

The Maxwell–Faraday equation also can be written in an &quot;integral form&quot; using the Kelvin–Stokes theorem.

So we have, the Maxwell–Faraday equation:
formula_40
and the Faraday law,
formula_41

The two are equivalent if the wire is not moving. Using the Leibniz integral rule and that , results in,
formula_42
and using the Maxwell Faraday equation,
formula_43
since this is valid for any wire position it implies that
formula_44

Faraday&#x27;s law of induction holds whether the loop of wire is rigid and stationary, or in motion or in process of deformation, and it holds whether the magnetic field is constant in time or changing. However, there are cases where Faraday&#x27;s law is either inadequate or difficult to use, and application of the underlying Lorentz force law is necessary. See inapplicability of Faraday&#x27;s law.

If the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, the magnetic flux linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the -field varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different B-field, will change. Alternatively, if the loop changes orientation with respect to the B-field, the differential element will change because of the different angle between and , also changing . As a third example, if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform, time-independent -field, and another portion of the circuit is held stationary, the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuit&#x27;s component parts with time (surface time-dependent). In all three cases, Faraday&#x27;s law of induction then predicts the EMF generated by the change in .

Note that the Maxwell Faraday&#x27;s equation implies that the Electric Field is non conservative when the Magnetic Field varies in time, and is not expressible as the gradient of a scalar field, and not subject to the gradient theorem since its curl is not zero.

== Lorentz force in terms of potentials ==
The and fields can be replaced by the magnetic vector potential and (scalar) electrostatic potential by
formula_45
where is the gradient, is the divergence, and is the curl.

The force becomes
formula_46

Using an identity for the triple product this can be rewritten as
formula_47

(Notice that the coordinates and the velocity components should be treated as independent variables, so the del operator acts only on not on thus, there is no need of using Feynman&#x27;s subscript notation in the equation above.) Using the chain rule, the total derivative of formula_48 is:
formula_49
so that the above expression becomes:
formula_50

With , we can put the equation into the convenient Euler–Lagrange form

where formula_51 and formula_52

== Lorentz force and analytical mechanics ==
The Lagrangian for a charged particle of mass and charge in an electromagnetic field equivalently describes the dynamics of the particle in terms of its &quot;energy&quot;, rather than the force exerted on it. The classical expression is given by:
formula_53
where and are the potential fields as above. The quantity formula_54 can be thought as a velocity-dependent potential function. Using Lagrange&#x27;s equations, the equation for the Lorentz force given above can be obtained again.

&lt;/math&gt;. For a &quot;ϕ&quot; field, the particle&#x27;s potential energy is formula_55.

The total potential energy is then:
formula_56
and the kinetic energy is:
formula_57
hence the Lagrangian:
formula_58

Lagrange&#x27;s equations are
formula_59
(same for and ). So calculating the partial derivatives:
formula_60
formula_61
equating and simplifying:
formula_62
formula_63
and similarly for the and directions. Hence the force equation is:
formula_64

The potential energy depends on the velocity of the particle, so the force is velocity dependent, so it is not conservative.

The relativistic Lagrangian is
formula_65

The action is the relativistic arclength of the path of the particle in spacetime, minus the potential energy contribution, plus an extra contribution which quantum mechanically is an extra phase a charged particle gets when it is moving along a vector potential.

{\mathrm{d}t} =\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{r}} = q {\partial \mathbf{A} \over \partial \mathbf{r}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}} - q {\partial \phi \over \partial \mathbf{r} }&lt;/math&gt;
formula_66
are the same as Hamilton&#x27;s equations of motion:
formula_67
formula_68
both are equivalent to the noncanonical form:
formula_69
This formula is the Lorentz force, representing the rate at which the EM field adds relativistic momentum to the particle.

== Relativistic form of the Lorentz force ==

=== Covariant form of the Lorentz force ===

==== Field tensor ====

Using the metric signature , the Lorentz force for a charge can be written in covariant form:

where is the four-momentum, defined as
formula_70
 the proper time of the particle, the contravariant electromagnetic tensor
formula_71
and is the covariant 4-velocity of the particle, defined as:
formula_72
in which
formula_73
is the Lorentz factor.

The fields are transformed to a frame moving with constant relative velocity by:
formula_74
where is the Lorentz transformation tensor.

==== Translation to vector notation ====

The component (-component) of the force is
formula_75

Substituting the components of the covariant electromagnetic tensor &quot;F&quot; yields
formula_76

Using the components of covariant four-velocity yields
formula_77

The calculation for (force components in the and directions) yields similar results, so collecting the three equations into one:
formula_78
and since differentials in coordinate time and proper time are related by the Lorentz factor,
formula_79
so we arrive at
formula_80

This is precisely the Lorentz force law, however, it is important to note that is the relativistic expression,
formula_81

=== Lorentz force in spacetime algebra (STA) ===

The electric and magnetic fields are dependent on the velocity of an observer, so the relativistic form of the Lorentz force law can best be exhibited starting from a coordinate-independent expression for the electromagnetic and magnetic fields formula_82, and an arbitrary time-direction, formula_83. This can be settled through spacetime algebra (or the geometric algebra of spacetime), a type of Clifford algebra defined on a pseudo-Euclidean space, as
formula_84
and
formula_85
formula_86 is a spacetime bivector (an oriented plane segment, just like a vector is an oriented line segment), which has six degrees of freedom corresponding to boosts (rotations in spacetime planes) and rotations (rotations in space-space planes). The dot product with the vector formula_83 pulls a vector (in the space algebra) from the translational part, while the wedge-product creates a trivector (in the space algebra) who is dual to a vector which is the usual magnetic field vector. The relativistic velocity is given by the (time-like) changes in a time-position vector where
formula_88
(which shows our choice for the metric) and the velocity is
formula_89

The proper form of the Lorentz force law (&#x27;invariant&#x27; is an inadequate term because no transformation has been defined) is simply
Note that the order is important because between a bivector and a vector the dot product is anti-symmetric. Upon a spacetime split like one can obtain the velocity, and fields as above yielding the usual expression.

=== Lorentz force in general relativity ===
In the general theory of relativity the equation of motion for a particle with mass formula_90 and charge formula_91, moving in a space with metric tensor formula_92 and electromagnetic field formula_93, is given as
formula_94
where formula_95 (formula_96 is taken along the trajectory), and 

The equation can also be written as
formula_97
where formula_98 is the Christoffel symbol (of the torsion-free metric connection in general relativity), or as
formula_99
where formula_100 is the covariant differential in general relativity (metric, torsion-free).

<text>Lorenzo di Piero de&#x27; Medici (), known as Lorenzo the Magnificent (; 1 January 1449 – 8 April 1492), was an Italian statesman, the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Florentine Republic, and the most powerful patron of Renaissance culture in Italy. Lorenzo held the balance of power within the Italic League, an alliance of states that stabilized political conditions on the Italian Peninsula for decades, and his life coincided with the mature phase of the Italian Renaissance and the golden age of Florence. As a patron, he is best known for his sponsorship of artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. On the foreign policy front, Lorenzo manifested a clear plan to stem the territorial ambitions of Pope Sixtus IV, in the name of the balance of the Italic League of 1454. For these reasons, Lorenzo was the subject of the Pazzi conspiracy (1478), in which his brother Giuliano was assassinated. The Peace of Lodi of 1454 that he supported among the various Italian states collapsed with his death. He is buried in the Medici Chapel in Florence.

==Youth==
Lorenzo&#x27;s grandfather, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, was the first member of the Medici family to lead the Republic of Florence and run the Medici Bank simultaneously. As one of the wealthiest men in Europe, the elder Cosimo spent a very large portion of his fortune on government and philanthropy, for example as a patron of the arts and financier of public works. Lorenzo&#x27;s father, Piero di Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, was equally at the centre of Florentine civic life, chiefly as an art patron and collector, while Lorenzo&#x27;s uncle, Giovanni di Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, took care of the family&#x27;s business interests. Lorenzo&#x27;s mother, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, was a writer of sonnets and a friend to poets and philosophers of the Medici Academy. She became her son&#x27;s advisor after the deaths of his father and uncle.

Lorenzo, considered the most promising of the five children of Piero and Lucrezia, was tutored by a diplomat and bishop, Gentile de&#x27; Becchi, and the humanist philosopher Marsilio Ficino, and he was trained in Greek by pivotal Renaissance scholar John Argyropoulos. With his brother Giuliano, he participated in jousting, hawking, hunting, and horse breeding for the Palio, a horse race in Siena. In 1469, aged 20, he won first prize in a jousting tournament sponsored by the Medici. The joust was the subject of a poem written by Luigi Pulci. Niccolò Machiavelli also wrote of the occasion, perhaps sarcastically, that he won &quot;not by way of favour, but by his own valour and skill in arms&quot;. He carried a banner painted by Verrocchio, and his horse was named Morello di Vento.

Piero sent Lorenzo on many important diplomatic missions when he was still a youth, including trips to Rome to meet the pope and other important religious and political figures.

Lorenzo was described as rather plain of appearance and of average height, having a broad frame and short legs, dark hair and eyes, a squashed nose, short-sighted eyes and a harsh voice. Giuliano, on the other hand, was regarded as handsome and a &quot;golden boy&quot;, and was used as a model by Botticelli in his painting of &quot;Mars and Venus&quot;. Even Lorenzo&#x27;s close friend Niccolo Valori described him as homely, saying, &quot;nature had been a stepmother to him in regards to his personal appearance, although she had acted as a loving mother in all things concocted with the mind. His complexion was dark, and although his face was not handsome it was so full of dignity as to compel respect.&quot;

==Politics==

Lorenzo, groomed for power, assumed a leading role in the state upon the death of his father in 1469, when he was 20. Already drained by his grandfather&#x27;s building projects and constantly stressed by mismanagement, wars, and political expenses, the assets of the Medici Bank were reduced seriously during the course of Lorenzo&#x27;s lifetime.

Lorenzo, like his grandfather, father, and son, ruled Florence indirectly through surrogates in the city councils by means of payoffs and strategic marriages until 1490. Rival Florentine families inevitably harboured resentments over the Medicis&#x27; dominance, and enemies of the Medici remained a factor in Florentine life long after Lorenzo&#x27;s passing. The most notable of the rival families was the Pazzi, who nearly brought Lorenzo&#x27;s reign to an end.

On Sunday, 26 April 1478, in an incident known as the Pazzi conspiracy, a group headed by Girolamo Riario, Francesco de&#x27; Pazzi, and Francesco Salviati (the archbishop of Pisa), attacked Lorenzo and his brother and co-ruler Giuliano in the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in an attempt to seize control of the Florentine government. Salviati acted with the blessing of his patron Pope Sixtus IV. Giuliano was killed, brutally stabbed to death, but Lorenzo escaped with only a minor wound to the neck, having been defended by the poet Poliziano and the banker Francesco Nori, the latter of whom was killed in the attack. News of the conspiracy spread throughout Florence, and it was brutally put down by the populace through such measures as the lynching of the archbishop of Pisa and members of the Pazzi family who were involved in the conspiracy.

In the aftermath of the Pazzi conspiracy and the punishment of supporters of Pope Sixtus IV, the Medici and Florence earned the wrath of the Holy See, which seized all the Medici assets that Sixtus could find, excommunicated Lorenzo and the entire government of Florence, and ultimately put the entire Florentine city-state under interdict. When these moves had little effect, Sixtus formed a military alliance with King Ferdinand I of Naples, whose son, Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, led an invasion of the Florentine Republic, still ruled by Lorenzo.

Lorenzo rallied the citizens. However, with little support from the traditional Medici allies in Bologna and Milan, the war dragged on, and only diplomacy by Lorenzo, who personally traveled to Naples and became a prisoner of the king for several months, ultimately resolved the crisis. That success enabled Lorenzo to secure constitutional changes within the government of the Florentine Republic that further enhanced his own power.

Thereafter, Lorenzo, like his grandfather Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, pursued a policy of maintaining peace, balancing power between the northern Italian states and keeping major European states such as France and the Holy Roman Empire out of Italy. Lorenzo maintained good relations with Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire, as the Florentine maritime trade with the Ottomans was a major source of wealth for the Medici.

Efforts to acquire revenue from the mining of alum in Tuscany unfortunately marred Lorenzo&#x27;s reputation. Alum had been discovered by local citizens of Volterra, who turned to Florence to get backing to exploit this important natural resource. A key commodity in the glassmaking, tanning and textile industries, alum was available from only a few sources under the control of the Ottomans and monopolized by Genoa before the discovery of alum sources in Italy at Tolfa. First the Roman Curia in 1462, and then Lorenzo and the Medici Bank less than a year later, got involved in backing the mining operation, with the pope taking a two-ducat commission for each cantar quintal of alum retrieved and ensuring a monopoly against the Turkish-derived goods by prohibiting trade in alum with infidels. When they realized the value of the alum mine, the people of Volterra wanted its revenues for their municipal funds rather than having it enter the pockets of their Florentine backers. Thus began an insurrection and secession from Florence, which involved putting to death several opposing citizens. Lorenzo sent mercenaries to suppress the revolt by force, and the mercenaries ultimately sacked the city. Lorenzo hurried to Volterra to make amends, but the incident would remain a dark stain on his record.

==Patronage==

Lorenzo&#x27;s court included artists such as Piero and Antonio del Pollaiuolo, Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Michelangelo Buonarroti, who were instrumental in achieving the 15th-century Renaissance. Although Lorenzo did not commission many works himself, he helped these artists to secure commissions from other patrons. Michelangelo lived with Lorenzo and his family for three years, dining at the family table and participating in discussions led by Marsilio Ficino.

Lorenzo was an artist and wrote poetry in his native Tuscan. In his poetry, he celebrates life while acknowledging with melancholy the fragility and instability of the human condition, particularly in his later works. Love, feasts and light dominate his verse.

Cosimo had started the collection of books that became the Medici Library (also called the Laurentian Library), and Lorenzo expanded it. Lorenzo&#x27;s agents retrieved from the East large numbers of classical works, and he employed a large workshop to copy his books and disseminate their content across Europe. He supported the development of humanism through his circle of scholarly friends, including the philosophers Marsilio Ficino, Poliziano and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. They studied Greek philosophers and attempted to merge the ideas of Plato with Christianity.

Apart from a personal interest, Lorenzo also used the Florentine milieu of fine arts for his diplomatic efforts. An example includes the commission of Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Pietro Perugino and Cosimo Rosselli from Rome to paint murals in the Sistine Chapel, a move that has been interpreted as sealing the alliance between Lorenzo and Pope Sixtus IV.

In 1471, Lorenzo calculated that his family had spent some 663,000 florins (about US$460 million today) on charity, buildings and taxes since 1434. He wrote, I do not regret this for though many would consider it better to have a part of that sum in their purse, I consider it to have been a great honour to our state, and I think the money was well-expended and I am well-pleased.

From 1479 Lorenzo became a permanent member of the committee supervising the rebuild of the &quot;signoria&quot; in Florence. He created a court of artists in his sculpture garden at San Marco which allowed him to exert &#x27;enormous influence on the selection of artists on public projects&#x27;.

==Marriage and children==

Lorenzo married Clarice Orsini on 7 February 1469. The marriage in person took place in Florence on 4 June 1469. She was a daughter of Giacomo Orsini, Lord of Monterotondo and Bracciano by his wife and cousin Maddalena Orsini.

Clarice and Lorenzo had 10 children, all except Contessina Antonia born in Florence:
* Lucrezia Maria Romola de&#x27; Medici (1470–1553), who married Jacopo Salviati on 10 September 1486 and had 10 children of her own, including Cardinal Giovanni Salviati, Cardinal Bernardo Salviati, Maria Salviati (mother of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany), and Francesca Salviati (mother of Pope Leo XI)
* Male twins who died after birth (March 1471)
* Piero di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (1472–1503), called &quot;the Unfortunate&quot;, was ruler of Florence after his father&#x27;s death; grandfather of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, queen of France
* Maria Maddalena Romola de&#x27; Medici (1473–1528) married Franceschetto Cybo (illegitimate son of Pope Innocent VIII) on 25 February 1487 and had seven children
* Contessina Beatrice de&#x27; Medici, died shortly after her birth on 23 September 1474
* Giovanni di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (1475–1521), ascended to the papacy as Leo X in 1513
* Luisa de&#x27; Medici (1477–1488), also called &quot;Luigia&quot;, was betrothed to Giovanni de&#x27; Medici il Popolano, but died young
* Contessina Antonia Romola de&#x27; Medici (1478–1515), born in Pistoia, married Piero Ridolfi (1467–1525) in 1494 and had five children, including Cardinal Niccolò Ridolfi
* Giuliano di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (1479–1516) was created Duke of Nemours in 1515 by Francis I of France

Lorenzo adopted his nephew Giulio di Giuliano de&#x27; Medici (1478–1534), the illegitimate son of his slain brother Giuliano. In 1523, after serving four years as ruler of Florence, Giulio ascended to the papacy as Pope Clement VII.

==Later years, death, and legacy==
During Lorenzo&#x27;s tenure, several branches of the family bank collapsed because of bad loans, and in later years he got into financial difficulties and resorted to misappropriating trust and state funds.

Toward the end of Lorenzo&#x27;s life, Florence came under the influence of Girolamo Savonarola, who believed Christians had strayed too far into Greco-Roman culture. Lorenzo played a role in bringing Savonarola to Florence.

Lorenzo died during the late night of 8 April 1492, at the longtime family villa of Careggi. Savonarola visited Lorenzo on his deathbed. The rumour that Savonarola damned Lorenzo on his deathbed has been refuted in Roberto Ridolfi&#x27;s book &quot;Vita di Girolamo Savonarola&quot;. Letters written by witnesses to Lorenzo&#x27;s death report that he died peacefully after listening to the Gospel of the day. Many signs and portents were claimed to have taken place at the moment of his death, including the dome of Florence Cathedral being struck by lightning, ghosts appearing, and the lions kept at Via Leone fighting one another.

The Signoria and councils of Florence issued a decree:

Lorenzo was buried with his brother Giuliano in the Basilica di San Lorenzo in the red porphyry sarcophagus designed for Piero and Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, not, as might be expected, in the New Sacristy, designed by Michelangelo. The latter holds the two monumental tombs of Lorenzo and Giuliano&#x27;s less known namesakes: Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, and Giuliano, Duke of Nemours. According to Williamson and others, the statues of the lesser Lorenzo and Giuliano were carved by Michelangelo to incorporate the essence of the famous men. In 1559, the bodies of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (&quot;the Magnificent&quot;) and his brother Giuliano were interred in the New Sacristy in an unmarked tomb beneath Michelangelo&#x27;s statue of the Madonna.

Medical researchers have suggested that Lorenzo may have suffered from acromegaly, a rare disorder that results from excessive secretion of growth hormone, based on interpretation of his reported symptoms, and later analysis of his skeleton and death mask.

Lorenzo&#x27;s heir was his eldest son, Piero di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, known as &quot;Piero the Unfortunate&quot;. In 1494, he squandered his father&#x27;s patrimony and brought down the Medici dynasty in Florence. His second son, Giovanni, who became Pope Leo X, retook the city in 1512 with the aid of a Spanish army. In 1531, Lorenzo&#x27;s nephew Giulio di Giuliano – whom Lorenzo had raised as his own son and who in 1523 became Pope Clement VII – formalized Medici rule of Florence by installing Alessandro de&#x27; Medici the city&#x27;s first hereditary duke.

<text>In mathematics and other fields, a lemma (: lemmas or lemmata) is a generally minor, proven proposition which is used to prove a larger statement. For that reason, it is also known as a &quot;helping theorem&quot; or an &quot;auxiliary theorem&quot;. In many cases, a lemma derives its importance from the theorem it aims to prove; however, a lemma can also turn out to be more important than originally thought.

==Etymology==
From the Ancient Greek λῆμμα, (perfect passive εἴλημμαι) something received or taken. Thus something taken for granted in an argument. 

==Comparison with theorem==
There is no formal distinction between a lemma and a theorem, only one of intention (see Theorem terminology). However, a lemma can be considered a minor result whose sole purpose is to help prove a more substantial theorem – a step in the direction of proof.

==Well-known lemmas==
Some powerful results in mathematics are known as lemmas, first named for their originally minor purpose. These include, among others:
* Bézout&#x27;s lemma
* Burnside&#x27;s lemma
* Dehn&#x27;s lemma
* Euclid&#x27;s lemma
* Farkas&#x27; lemma
* Fatou&#x27;s lemma
* Gauss&#x27;s lemma (any of several named after Carl Friedrich Gauss)
* Greendlinger&#x27;s lemma
* Itô&#x27;s lemma
* Jordan&#x27;s lemma
* Lovász local lemma
* Nakayama&#x27;s lemma
* Poincaré&#x27;s lemma
* Riesz&#x27;s lemma
* Schur&#x27;s lemma
* Schwarz&#x27;s lemma
* Sperner&#x27;s lemma
* Urysohn&#x27;s lemma
* Vitali covering lemma
* Yoneda&#x27;s lemma
* Zorn&#x27;s lemma
While these results originally seemed too simple or too technical to warrant independent interest, they have eventually turned out to be central to the theories in which they occur.

<doc id="18639" wikidata="Q191103" url="?curid=18639" title="Lucrezia Borgia">
<text>Lucrezia Borgia (18 April 1480 – 24 June 1519) was an Italian noblewoman of the House of Borgia who was the illegitimate daughter of Pope Alexander VI and Vannozza dei Cattanei. She was a former governor of Spoleto.

Her family arranged several marriages for her that advanced their own political position, including Giovanni Sforza, Lord of Pesaro and Gradara, Count of Cotignola; Alfonso of Aragon, Duke of Bisceglie and Prince of Salerno; and Alfonso I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara. Alfonso of Aragon was an illegitimate son of the King of Naples, and tradition has it that Lucrezia&#x27;s brother, Cesare Borgia, may have had him murdered, after his political value waned.

Notorious tales about her family cast Lucrezia as a &quot;femme fatale&quot;, a controversial role in which she has been latter portrayed in many artworks, novels, and films.

==Early life==

Lucrezia Borgia was born on 18 April 1480 at Subiaco, near Rome. Her mother was Vannozza dei Cattanei, one of the mistresses of Lucrezia&#x27;s father, Cardinal Rodrigo de Borgia (later Pope Alexander VI). 

During her early life, Lucrezia Borgia&#x27;s education was entrusted to Adriana Orsini de Milan, a close confidant of her father. Her education would primarily take place in the Palazzo Pizzo de Merlo, a building adjacent to her father&#x27;s residence. Unlike most educated women of her time, for whom convents were the primary source for knowledge, her education came from within the sphere of intellectuals in the court and close relatives, and it included a solid grounding in the Humanities, which the Catholic Church was reviving, at the time. She was a thoroughly accomplished princess, fluent in Spanish, Catalan, Italian, and French, which prepared her for advantageous marriage to any European monarch or prince, and literate in both Latin and Greek. She would also become proficient in the lute, poetry, and oration. The biggest testament to her intelligence is her ability in administration, as later on in life, she took care of Vatican City correspondence and governance of Ferrara.

==List of marriages==

===First marriage: Giovanni Sforza (Lord of Pesaro and Gradara)===

On 26 February 1491, a matrimonial arrangement was drawn up between Lucrezia and the Lord of Val D&#x27;Ayora, in the Kingdom of Valencia, Don Cherubino Joan de Centelles (d. 1522). The arrangement was annulled, less than two months later, in favor of a new contract engaging Lucrezia to Don Gaspare Aversa, Count of Procida (1476-1534). When Rodrigo became Pope Alexander VI, he sought to be allied with powerful, princely families and founding dynasties of Italy. He, therefore, called off Lucrezia&#x27;s previous engagements and arranged for her to marry Giovanni Sforza, a member of the House of Sforza who was Lord of Pesaro and titled Count of Catignola. Giovanni was an illegitimate son of Costanzo I Sforza and, therefore, a Sforza of the second rank. He married Lucrezia on 12 June 1493 in Rome.

Before long, the Borgia family no longer needed the Sforzas, and the presence of Giovanni Sforza, in the papal court, was superfluous. The Pope needed new, more advantageous political alliances, so he might have covertly ordered the execution of Giovanni: the generally accepted version is that Lucrezia was informed of this by her brother, Cesare, and she warned her husband, who fled Rome.

Alexander asked Giovanni&#x27;s uncle, Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, to persuade Giovanni to agree to an annulment of the marriage. Giovanni refused and accused Lucrezia of paternal incest. The pope asserted that his daughter&#x27;s marriage had not been consummated and was, thus, invalid. Giovanni was offered her dowry, in return for his cooperation. The Sforza family threatened to withdraw their protection, should he refuse. Giovanni finally signed confessions of impotence and documents of annulment, before witnesses.

===Purported affair with Pedro Calderon===
There has been speculation that during the prolonged process of the annulment, Lucrezia consummated a relationship with someone, perhaps Alexander&#x27;s chamberlain Pedro Calderon (sometimes called Perotto). In any case, families hostile to the Borgias would later accuse her of being pregnant, at the time her marriage was annulled for non-consummation. She is known to have retired to the cloistered Convent of Saint Sixtus in Vecchio where she was given sanctuary by the Mother Superior in June 1497, to await the outcome of the annulment proceedings, which were finalized in December of the same year. 

The bodies of Pedro Calderon and a maid, Pantasilea, were found in the Tiber in February 1498. In March 1498, the Ferrarese ambassador claimed that Lucrezia had given birth, but this was denied by other sources. A child was born, however, in the Borgia household, the year before Lucrezia&#x27;s marriage to Alfonso of Aragon. He was named Giovanni but is known to historians as the &quot;&quot;Infans Romanus.”&quot;

In 1501, two papal bulls were issued, concerning the child, Giovanni Borgia. In the first, he was recognized as Cesare&#x27;s child from an affair, before his marriage. The second contradictory bull recognized him as the son of Pope Alexander VI. Lucrezia&#x27;s name is not mentioned in either, and rumours that she was his mother have never been proven. The second bull was kept secret, for many years, and Giovanni was assumed to be Cesare&#x27;s son. This is supported by the fact that in 1502, he became Duke of Camerino, one of Cesare&#x27;s recent conquests, hence the natural inheritance of the Duke of Romagna&#x27;s oldest son. Giovanni went to stay with Lucrezia in Ferrara, after Alexander&#x27;s death, where he was accepted as her half-brother.

===Second marriage: Alfonso d&#x27;Aragon (Duke of Bisceglie and Prince of Salerno)===

Following her annulment from Sforza, Lucrezia was married to the Neapolitan Alfonso of Aragon, the half-brother of Sancha of Aragon, who was the wife of Lucrezia&#x27;s brother Gioffre Borgia. The marriage was a short one.

They were married in 1498, making Lucrezia the Duchess consort of Bisceglie and Princess consort of Salerno. Lucrezia, not her husband, was appointed governor of Spoleto, in 1499; Alfonso fled Rome, shortly afterwards, but he returned at Lucrezia&#x27;s request, only to be murdered in 1500.

It was widely rumoured that Lucrezia&#x27;s brother, Cesare, was responsible for Alfonso&#x27;s death, as he had recently allied himself (through marriage) with France, against Naples. Lucrezia and Alfonso had one child, Rodrigo of Aragon, who was born in 1499 and predeceased his mother, in August 1512, at the age of 12.

===Third marriage: Alfonso d&#x27;Este (Duke of Ferrara)===

After the death of Lucrezia&#x27;s second husband, her father, Pope Alexander VI, arranged a third marriage. Then, she married Alfonso I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, in early 1502 in Ferrara. She had eight children, during this marriage, and was considered a respectable and accomplished Renaissance duchess, effectively rising above her previous reputation and surviving the fall of the Borgias, following her father&#x27;s death.

Neither partner was faithful: beginning in 1503, Lucrezia enjoyed a long relationship with her brother-in-law, Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua. Francesco&#x27;s wife was the cultured intellectual Isabella d&#x27;Este, the sister of Alfonso, to whom Lucrezia had made overtures of friendship, to no avail. The affair between Francesco and Lucrezia was passionate, more sexual than sentimental, as can be attested in the fevered love letters the pair wrote one another. It has been claimed that the affair ended, when Francesco contracted syphilis and had to end sexual relations with Lucrezia. This last assertion is troublesome, as Francesco had contracted syphilis before 1500, as it was known that he passed the disease onto his eldest son, Federico Gonzaga, who was born in 1500. Francesco did not meet Lucrezia until 1502.

Lucrezia also had a love affair with the poet Pietro Bembo, during her third marriage. Their love letters were deemed &quot;the prettiest love letters in the world&quot; by the Romantic poet Lord Byron, when he saw them in the Ambrosian Library of Milan on 15 October 1816. On the same occasion, Byron claimed to have stolen a lock of Lucrezia&#x27;s hair – &quot;the prettiest and fairest imaginable&quot; – that was also held there on display.

Lucrezia met the famed French soldier, the Chevalier Bayard, while the latter was co-commanding the French allied garrison of Ferrara, in 1510. According to his biographer, the Chevalier became a great admirer of Lucrezia&#x27;s, considering her a &quot;pearl on this Earth&quot;.

After a long history of complicated pregnancies and miscarriages, on 14 June 1519, Lucrezia gave birth to her tenth child, which she named Isabella Maria, in honor of Alfonso&#x27;s sister, Isabella d&#x27;Este. The child was sickly, and fearing she would die unbaptised, Alfonso ordered her to be baptized, immediately, with Eleonora Pico della Mirandola and Count Alexandro Serafino as godparents.

Lucrezia had become very weak, during the pregnancy, and fell seriously ill, after the birth. After seeming to recover for two days, she worsened, again, and died on 24 June of the same year. She was buried in the convent of Corpus Domini.

==Appearance==

She is described as having heavy blonde hair that fell past her knees, a beautiful complexion, hazel eyes that changed colour, a full, high bosom, and a natural grace that made her appear to &quot;walk on air&quot;. These physical attributes were highly appreciated, in Italy due to its parallel descriptions of the Roman goddess of arts, Minerva. Another description said, &quot;her mouth is rather large, the teeth brilliantly white, her neck is slender and fair, and the bust is admirably proportioned.&quot;

One painting, &quot;Portrait of a Youth&quot; by Dosso Dossi at the National Gallery of Victoria, was identified as a portrait of Lucrezia in November 2008. This painting may be the only surviving formal portrait of Lucrezia Borgia; however, doubts have been cast on that attribution. Several other paintings, such as Veneto&#x27;s fanciful portrait, have also been said to depict her, but none have been accepted by scholars, at present.

According to Mandell Creighton in his &quot;History of the Papacy&quot;:

==Black legend== 

Several rumours have persisted, throughout the years, primarily speculating as to the nature of the extravagant parties thrown by the Borgia family. One example is the Banquet of Chestnuts. Many of these allegations concern accusations of Lucrezia&#x27;s involvement in incest, poisoning, and murder. For example, it was rumoured that Lucrezia was in possession of a hollow ring that she used to poison drinks. However, no historical basis for these accusations exists, beyond the attacks of her enemies.

A modern 20th-century British painting by Frank Cadogan Cowper that hangs in the Tate Britain art gallery in London portrays Lucrezia taking the place of her father, Pope Alexander VI, at an official Vatican meeting. This apparently documents an event, although the moment depicted (a Franciscan friar kissing Lucrezia&#x27;s feet) was invented by the artist.

==Children==
Lucrezia was mother to seven or eight known children:
# A miscarriage / stillborn daughter (16 February 1499);
# Rodrigo of Aragon (1 November 1499 – August 1512), son by Alfonso of Aragon;
# A stillborn daughter (1502), first child by d&#x27;Este;
# Alessandro d&#x27;Este (1505–1505);
# Ercole II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara (5 April 1508 – 3 October 1559);
# Ippolito II d&#x27;Este (25 August 1509 – 1 December 1572). Archbishop of Milan and later Cardinal;
# Alessandro d&#x27;Este (1514–1516);
# Leonora d&#x27;Este (3 July 1515 – 15 July 1575), a nun and composer;
# Francesco d&#x27;Este, Marquess of Massalombarda (1 November 1516 – 2 February 1578);
# Isabella Maria d&#x27;Este (born and died on 14 June 1519). Complications at birth caused the death of Lucrezia ten days later.

Giovanni Borgia, &quot;infans Romanus&quot; (&quot;Child of Rome,” c. 1498–1548) had his paternity acknowledged by Alexander and Cesare, in two Papal bulls, but it was rumoured that he was the child of Lucrezia and Pedro Calderon. The child (identified, in later life, as Lucrezia&#x27;s half-brother) was most likely the result of a liaison between Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI, Lucrezia&#x27;s father) and an unknown mistress and was not Lucrezia&#x27;s child.

The Italian historian Maria Bellonci claims that Lucrezia gave birth to three children who did not survive infancy, one by Alfonso of Aragon and two by Alfonso d&#x27;Este. She is also thought to have had at least four miscarriages.

* In the pilot episode of the SyFy series &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;, a jeweled comb, purported to have been created for her by an alchemist, is used by an Iowa lawyer to hypnotize several individuals into causing acts of violence.
* In the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot;, Lucrezia is in an incestuous relationship with her brother Cesare. She is taken hostage by the main character, Ezio Auditore, and reappears later, a changed woman.
* She is played by Holliday Grainger in the 2011–2013 Showtime/Bravo TV series &quot;The Borgias&quot;, which explores a theme of incest with Cesare, despite lack of historical evidence for such events. Her character is portrayed not as a ruthless murderer, but initially as a compassionate and sweet young girl who suffers from her family&#x27;s ambitions, both struggling against and eventually aiding them.
* In the Canal+ television series &quot;Borgia&quot;, Lucrezia is portrayed by German actress Isolda Dychauk.
* In Season 1, Episode 7 of the television series &quot; The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot;, Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman travel back in time to rescue Lucrezia&#x27;s then-husband from being poisoned by her cooking.
* She is mentioned in Season 1, episode 1 of &quot;My Three Sons&quot;.
* In the 1983 BBC television series &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, the title character makes an offhand comment about Lucrezia throwing a &quot;wine and anthrax party&quot;, presumably referring to the rumours that persist around the Borgia families&#x27; extravagant parties.
* Martha Howe-Douglas played Lucrezia Borgia in an episode of &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; which features a parody of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; theme.

===Music===
* English rock band The Sisters of Mercy reference Lucrezia as “Lucretia” in their 1988 single Lucretia My Reflection, released as the third and final single from their second studio album, &quot;Floodland.&quot;

* The Megadeth song Lucretia, which appears on their 1990 album &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, is inspired by Lucrezia Borgia.

* The Hatsune Miku &amp; KAITO song &quot;Cantarella&quot; by Whiteflame is based on Lucrezia Borgia and her brother Cesare Borgia.

<doc id="18640" wikidata="Q1637831" url="?curid=18640" title="List of Mac models grouped by CPU type">
<text>This list of Mac models grouped by CPU type contains all central processing units (CPUs) used by Apple Inc. for their Mac computers. It is grouped by processor family, processor model, and then chronologically by Mac models.

== Motorola 68k ==
=== Motorola 68000 ===

The Motorola 68000 was the first Apple Macintosh processor. It has 32-bit CPU registers, a 24-bit address bus, and a 16-bit data path; Motorola referred to it as a &quot;16-/32-bit microprocessor.&quot;

=== Motorola 68020 ===

The Motorola 68020 was the first 32-bit Mac processor, first used on the Macintosh II. The 68020 has many improvements over the 68000, including an instruction cache, and was the first Mac processor to support a paged memory management unit, the Motorola 68851.

The Macintosh LC configured the 68020 to use a 16-bit system bus with ASICs that limited RAM to 10 MB (as opposed to the 32-bit limit of 4 GB).

=== Motorola 68030 ===

The Motorola 68030 was the first Mac processor with an integrated paged memory management unit, allowing for virtual memory. Another improvement over the 68020 was the addition of a data cache.

=== Motorola 68040 ===

The Motorola 68040 has improved per-clock performance compared to the 68030, as well as larger instruction and data caches, and was the first Mac processor with an integrated floating-point unit.

The MC68LC040 version was less expensive because it omitted the floating-point unit.

== PowerPC ==
=== PowerPC 601 ===

The PowerPC 601 was the first Mac processor to support the 32-bit PowerPC instruction set architecture.

=== PowerPC 603 ===


=== PowerPC 604 ===

The PowerPC 604e was the first Mac processor available in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) configuration.

=== PowerPC G3 ===

=== PowerPC G4 ===
The PowerPC 7400 was the first Mac processor to include an AltiVec vector processing unit.

The PowerPC 7455 was the first Mac processor over 1 GHz.

=== PowerPC G5 ===
The PowerPC 970 (&quot;G5&quot;) was the first 64-bit Mac processor.

The PowerPC 970MP was the first dual-core Mac processor and the first to be found in a quad-core configuration. It was also the first Mac processor with partitioning and virtualization capabilities.

Apple only used three variants of the G5, and soon moved entirely onto Intel architecture.

== Intel x86 ==
Sources: and 

=== Overview ===

=== P6 ===
Yonah was the first Mac processor to support the IA-32 instruction set architecture, in addition to the MMX, SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 extension instruction sets.

The Core Solo was a Core Duo with one of the two cores disabled.

=== Core ===
Woodcrest added support for the SSSE3 instruction set.

Merom was the first Mac processor to support the x86-64 instruction set, as well as the first 64-bit processor to appear in a Mac notebook.

Clovertown was the first quad-core Mac processor and the first to be found in an 8-core configuration.

=== Penryn ===

Penryn added support for a subset for SSE4 (SSE4.1).

=== Nehalem ===
Bloomfield and Gainestown introduced a number of notable features for the first time in any Mac processors:

*Integrated memory controllers (with on-die DMI or QPI).
*Simultaneous multithreading (branded as Hyper-threading).
*Full support for the SSE4 instruction set (SSE4.2).
*Support for Intel Turbo Boost.
*Four cores on a single die rather than a multi-chip module of two dual-core dies.

=== Westmere ===
Arrandale introduced Intel HD Graphics, an on-die integrated GPU.

=== Sandy Bridge ===

Sandy Bridge added support for Intel Quick Sync Video, a dedicated on-die video encoding and decoding core. It was also the first quad-core processor to appear in a Mac notebook.

=== Ivy Bridge ===

=== Haswell ===
The Crystal Well variant used in some MacBook Pros contains an on-package L4 cache shared between the CPU and integrated graphics.

=== Broadwell ===

=== Skylake ===

=== Kaby Lake ===

=== Coffee Lake ===

Coffee Lake was the first 6-core processor to appear in a Mac notebook.

=== Cascade Lake ===

=== Comet Lake ===

=== Ice Lake ===

Ice Lake (Sunny Cove) is a 10th generation chip.

=== M1 ===
The M1 is a system on a chip fabricated by TSMC on the 5 nm process and contains 16 billion transistors. Its CPU cores are the first to be used in a Mac processor designed by Apple and the first to use the ARM instruction set architecture. It has 8 CPU cores (4 performance and 4 efficiency), up to 8 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine, as well as LPDDR4X memory with a bandwidth of 68 GB/s. The M1 Pro and M1 Max SoCs are fabricated by TSMC on the 5 nm process and contain 33.7 and 57 billion transistors respectively. Both have 10 CPU cores (8 performance and 2 efficiency) and a 16-core Neural Engine.

<text>Jonathan Smeeton is a British lighting and production designer who was active in the UK from the late 1960s, and then in the US from late 1970s up to his retirement in 2018.

Smeeton started out in the UK underground scene in the late 1960s. By 1971, he had become involved with Hawkwind, using the alias Liquid Len and the Lensmen (a reference to the &quot;Lensman&quot; space opera books), and remained with them for seven years developing his craft.

He was name-checked in the Genesis song &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot; from &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; (1973), later going on to work for the band&#x27;s singer Peter Gabriel:
He&#x27;s name-checked a second time in the same song : 
&quot;And Liquid Len, with his smashed bottle men is lobbing Bob the Nob across the gob&quot;

He retired from the business in April 2018, his last official show being for Diana Ross and the LA Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl in June 2018. In 2018, he received the Parnelli Visionary Award.

<text>Ian Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 – 28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy Kilmister or simply Lemmy, was a British musician. He was the founder, lead singer, bassist and primary songwriter of the rock band Motörhead, of which he was the only continuous member, and a member of Hawkwind from 1971 to 1975.

A foundational force in the genre following the advent of the new wave of British heavy metal, Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature friendly mutton chops, his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice. It was once declared &quot;one of the most recognisable voices in rock&quot;. He was also noted for his unique posture when singing, which was once described as &quot;looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face&quot;. He was also known for his bass playing style, using his Rickenbacker bass to create an &quot;overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble&quot;. A notable aspect of his bass sound was his guitar-like riffing, often playing power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall.

Lemmy was born in Stoke-on-Trent and grew up between there, the nearby towns of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Madeley, and later the Welsh village of Benllech, Anglesey. At a later point, Lemmy remembers living briefly at Gwrych Castle, Abergele. He was influenced by rock and roll and the early works of the Beatles, which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s, such as The Rockin&#x27; Vickers. He worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and The Nice before joining the space rock band Hawkwind in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit &quot;Silver Machine&quot;. In 1975, he was fired from Hawkwind after an arrest for drug possession. That same year, he founded Motörhead. The band&#x27;s success peaked around 1980 and 1981, including the hit single &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; and the chart-topping live album &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot;.

Lemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Motörhead until his death on 28 December 2015 in Los Angeles, where he had lived since 1990. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer two days before his death. Alongside his music career, he had minor roles and cameos in film and television. He was known for his hard-living, road-driven lifestyle, which included chain-smoking and daily consumption of large amounts of alcohol and amphetamine.

== Early life ==
Lemmy was born Ian Fraser Kilmister in the Burslem area of Stoke-on-Trent on 24 December 1945. When he was three months old, his father, an ex-Royal Air Force chaplain and concert pianist, separated from his mother. He moved with his mother and grandmother to nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme, then to Madeley. When Ian was 10, his mother married former rugby player George L. Willis, who already had two older children from a previous marriage, Patricia and Tony, whom Ian disliked. They later moved to a farm in the Welsh village of Benllech, with Lemmy commenting that &quot;funnily enough, being the only English kid among 700 Welsh ones didn&#x27;t make for the happiest time, but it was interesting from an anthropological point of view&quot;. He attended Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones, a comprehensive school in Amlwch, where he was nicknamed &quot;Lemmy.&quot; It was later suggested by some that the name originated from the phrase &quot;lemmy [lend me] a quid &#x27;til Friday&quot; because of his alleged habit of borrowing money from people to play slot machines, although Lemmy himself said that he did not know the origin of the name. He soon started to show an interest in rock and roll, girls, motorbikes and horses.

At school, Lemmy noticed a pupil who had brought a guitar to school and had been &quot;surrounded by chicks.&quot; His mother had a guitar, which he then took to school, and was himself surrounded by girls even though he could not play. By the time he left school, he had moved with his family to Conwy. He went on to work several odd jobs, including one at the local Hotpoint electric appliance factory, while also playing guitar for local bands such as the Sundowners and spending time at a horse-riding school. He saw the Beatles perform at the Cavern Club in Liverpool when he was 16, and then learned to play along on guitar to their first album &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. He also admired the sarcastic attitude of the group, particularly that of John Lennon, and later said of the group, &quot;Brian Epstein cleaned them up for mass consumption, but they were anything but sissies. They were from Liverpool ... a hard, sea-farin&#x27; town, all these dockers and sailors around all the time who would beat the piss out of you if you so much as winked at them. ... The Rolling Stones were the mummy&#x27;s boys—they were all college students from the outskirts of London. ... The Stones made great records, but they were always shit on stage, whereas the Beatles were the gear.&quot;

== Career ==

=== 1960–1970: Early years ===

In Stockport, Lemmy joined local bands the Rainmakers and then the Motown Sect who played northern clubs for three years. In 1965, he joined The Rockin&#x27; Vickers who signed a deal with CBS, released three singles and toured Europe, reportedly being the first British band to visit the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Rockin&#x27; Vickers moved to Manchester, where they shared a flat together.

Leaving the Rockin&#x27; Vickers, Lemmy moved to London in 1967. He shared a flat with Noel Redding, bassist of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and with Neville Chesters, their road manager. He got a job as a roadie for the band. In 1968, he joined the psychedelic rock band Sam Gopal under the name Ian Willis and recorded the album &quot;Escalator&quot; which was released in 1969. After meeting Simon King at a shopping centre in Chelsea in 1969, he joined the band Opal Butterfly, but the group soon disbanded, having failed to raise enough interest with their singles.

=== 1971–1975: Hawkwind ===
: &quot;See also Hawkwind (1970–75: United Artists era)&quot;

In August 1971, Lemmy joined the space rock band Hawkwind, who were based in Ladbroke Grove, London, as a bassist and vocalist. He had no previous experience as a bass guitarist, and was cajoled into joining immediately before a benefit gig in Notting Hill by bandmate Michael &quot;Dik Mik&quot; Davies, to have two members who enjoyed amphetamine. Lemmy states that he originally auditioned for Hawkwind as a guitarist, but on the morning of the Notting Hill gig, they decided not to get another guitarist. By chance, the bass player did not show up and left his equipment in the van. He often said, &quot;Their bass player was pretty much saying &#x27;please steal my gig!&#x27; So I stole his gig.&quot; Lemmy quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using double stops and chords rather than the single note lines preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a distinctive part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on the double live album &quot;Space Ritual&quot;. He also provided the lead vocals on several songs, including the band&#x27;s biggest UK chart single, &quot;Silver Machine&quot;, which reached #3 in 1972.

In May 1975, during a North American tour, Lemmy was arrested at the Canadian border in Windsor, Ontario, on drug possession charges. The border police mistook the amphetamine he was carrying for cocaine and he was kept overnight in jail before being released without charge. The band and management were concerned that his arrest might stop the band from crossing back into the United States, even though he had been released without charge. They were also tired of what they saw as his erratic behaviour, so they decided to fire him.

He once said of Hawkwind: &quot;I did like being in Hawkwind, and I believe I&#x27;d still be playing with them today if I hadn&#x27;t been kicked out. It was fun onstage, not so much offstage. They didn&#x27;t want to mesh with me. Musically, I loved the drummer, the guitar player. It was a great band.” 

=== 1975–2015: Motörhead ===
After Hawkwind, Lemmy formed a new band called &quot;Bastard&quot; with guitarist Larry Wallis (former member of the Pink Fairies, Steve Peregrin Took&#x27;s band Shagrat and UFO) and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy and Took were friends, and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy&#x27;s son Paul. When his manager informed him that a band by the name of &quot;Bastard&quot; would never get a slot on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, Lemmy changed the band&#x27;s name to &quot;Motörhead&quot; – the title of the last song he had written for Hawkwind.

Soon after, Wallis and Fox were replaced with guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke and drummer Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor and with this line-up, the band began to achieve success. Lemmy&#x27;s guttural vocals were unique in rock at that time, and were copied during the time when punk rock became popular. The band&#x27;s sound appealed to Lemmy&#x27;s original fans and, eventually, to fans of punk. Lemmy asserted that he generally felt more kinship with punks than with metalheads; he also played with the Damned for a handful of gigs when they had no regular bassist. Motörhead&#x27;s success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with several UK chart hits, including the single &quot;Ace of Spades,&quot; which remained a crowd favourite throughout the band&#x27;s career, and the UK #1 live album &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot;. Motörhead became one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Their – and Lemmy&#x27;s – final live performance was in Berlin, Germany, on 11 December 2015 during the band&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Tour.
== Personal life ==
At the age of 17, Lemmy met a holidaying girl named Cathy. He followed her to Stockport, where she gave birth to his son Sean, who was put up for adoption. In the 2010 documentary film &quot;Lemmy&quot;, he mentioned having a son whose mother had only recently reconnected with him and &quot;hadn&#x27;t got the heart to tell him who his father was.&quot; Later, during his time with The Rockin&#x27; Vickers, he slept with a woman in Manchester named Tracy; she had a son, Paul Inder, whom Lemmy met six years later. As an adult, Inder became a guitarist and occasionally joined Lemmy on stage.

Lemmy lived in Los Angeles from 1990 until his death in 2015, his last residence being a two-room apartment two blocks away from his favourite hangout, the Rainbow Bar and Grill.

In the 2005 Channel 4 documentary &quot;Motörhead: Live Fast, Die Old&quot;, it was claimed that Lemmy had slept with over 2,000 women. He later quipped, &quot;I said more than 1,000; the magazine made 2,000 of it.&quot; &quot;Maxim&quot; had Lemmy at No. 8 on its top ten &quot;Living Sex Legends&quot; list, as they claimed that he had slept with around 1,200 women. He is featured in the book &quot;Sex Tips from Rock Stars&quot; (2010) by Paul Miles.

Dave Grohl, on his Probot website, describes musicians with whom he has worked. In his entry for Lemmy, he wrote:

Lemmy was well known for his heavy drinking. The documentary &quot;Motörhead: Live Fast Die Old&quot; stated that he drank a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x27;s every day and had done so since he was 30 years old. In 2013, he stopped drinking Jack Daniel&#x27;s for health reasons. During his time with Hawkwind, he developed an addiction to amphetamine and LSD, particularly the former. Before joining Hawkwind, he recalled Dik Mik, a former Hawkwind sound technician, visiting his home in the middle of the night and taking amphetamines with him. They became interested in how long &quot;you could make the human body jump about without stopping&quot;, which they did for a few months until Mik ran out of money and wanted to return to Hawkwind, taking Lemmy with him.

In November 2005, he was invited to the National Assembly for Wales as a guest speaker by Conservative member William Graham. He was asked to express his views on the detrimental effects of drugs and called for the legalisation of heroin. He stated that legalisation would eradicate the drug dealer from society and generate money from its taxation, however hard this would be to accept.

Lemmy collected German military regalia; he had an Iron Cross emblazoned on his bass, which led to accusations of Nazi sympathies. He stated that he collected Nazi memorabilia because he liked the way it looked, and he considered himself an anarchist. He spoke against racism many times. Lemmy said he was against religion, government, and established authority. In 2011, he identified as agnostic, saying: &quot;I can find out when I die. I can wait. I&#x27;m not in a hurry.&quot; Jeff Hanneman, the founder of the thrash metal band Slayer, befriended Lemmy due to their shared fondness for collecting Nazi memorabilia. According to Keith Emerson&#x27;s autobiography, Lemmy gave him two of his Hitler Youth knives during his time as a roadie for the Nice. Emerson used these knives many times as keyholders when playing the Hammond organ during concerts with The Nice and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer before destroying them. Lemmy defended his collection by saying that if his then-girlfriend (who was black) had no problem with it, nobody else should.

== Illness and death ==
In December 2000, Lemmy&#x27;s tour was cancelled when he was hospitalised in Italy with the flu, exhaustion, and a lung infection. He was hospitalised with extreme dehydration and exhaustion in Germany in July 2005. As he grew older, he consumed less alcohol and drugs because he suffered from diabetes and hypertension. In June 2013, it was reported that he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted. His tour was cancelled in July 2013 due to a severe haematoma. He referred to his continuing drug use as &quot;dogged insolence in the face of mounting opposition to the contrary&quot;. Towards the end of his life, he had to use a walking stick. He had started smoking at the age of 11. In August 2015, he said he had cut down his smoking habit from two packs a day to one pack a week. He was hospitalised with a lung infection in September 2015, after having breathing problems when performing onstage.

On 28 December 2015, four days after his 70th birthday, Lemmy died at his Los Angeles apartment from prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure. Motörhead announced his death on their official Facebook page later that day. According to the band, his cancer had only been diagnosed two days prior to his death.

Lemmy&#x27;s manager, Todd Singerman, later revealed:

Lemmy&#x27;s doctor had given him between two and six months to live. Mikael Maglieri, owner of his nearby hangout Rainbow Bar and Grill, subsequently had a video game machine that Lemmy was fond of playing taken from the establishment and put in Lemmy&#x27;s apartment so he could continue playing it from his bedside. Although his manager had planned to keep the news private until his eventual death, Lemmy strongly encouraged him to make the diagnosis public in early 2016, but he died before a press release could be drafted.

===Funeral===
Lemmy&#x27;s memorial service took place at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, on 9 January 2016. The service was streamed live over YouTube with more than 230,000 people logging on to watch, while others gathered at the Rainbow. His body was cremated following the funeral. His remains were placed in a 3D-printed urn shaped like his trademark cavalry hat and emblazoned with the slogan &quot;Born to lose, lived to win&quot;. The piece was on display during his funeral and was later interred at Forest Lawn.

In March 2021, it was revealed that some of Lemmy&#x27;s ashes were, by his own request, put into bullets and sent to his closest friends, including Whitfield Crane, Rob Halford, Michael Monroe, Doro Pesch and Riki Rachtman. In August 2023, it was reported that some of Lemmy&#x27;s ashes were also scattered into the mud at Wacken Open Air music festival. In April 2024, it was reported James Hetfield got an Ace of Spades tattoo with some of Lemmy’s ashes in it. 

===Tributes===

In various media, additional tributes appeared from fellow rock stars such as Rob Halford, Dave Grohl, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Metallica, Scott Ian of Anthrax, and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.

In 2005, the UK magazine &quot;Classic Rock&quot; presented Lemmy with its first &quot;Living Legend&quot; award. In a 2013 interview with the magazine, Lemmy said he had never expected to make it to 30, but he spoke very pointedly about the future, indicating neither he nor the band was obsessing about the end:

In February 2016, the Hollywood Vampires performed at the Grammy Award ceremony as a tribute to Lemmy. On 11 June, Download Festival paid tribute to Lemmy by renaming the main stage the &quot;Lemmy Stage&quot;, and in the slot where Motorhead were due to play, there was a video tribute to Lemmy in which they played his music and his peers talked about him. On 17 November, Metallica released a tribute song titled &quot;Murder One&quot;, named after Lemmy&#x27;s frequently used amp. The song, from their album &quot;Hardwired... to Self-Destruct&quot;, depicts Lemmy&#x27;s rise to fame. On 18 January 2017, Lemmy was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for being the creator of thrash metal. In 2017, the extinct crocodile relative &quot;Lemmysuchus&quot; was named after Lemmy. On 14 November 2016, asteroid 243002 was officially named 243002 Lemmy, complementing asteroid 250840 Motorhead, named after the band in 2014.

In 2018, Hawkwind recorded a new acoustic version of Lemmy&#x27;s &quot;The Watcher&quot; (originally recorded on &quot;Doremi Fasil Latido&quot;, 1972) on the album &quot;The Road to Utopia&quot; with production, arrangement and additional orchestrations by Mike Batt and a guest appearance from Eric Clapton.

== Collaborations ==
Lemmy worked with several musicians, apart from his Motörhead bandmates, over the course of his career. He wrote the song &quot;R.A.M.O.N.E.S&quot; for the Ramones, which he played in his live sets as a tribute to the band. He also produced a Ramones EP and an album for Warfare entitled &quot;Metal Anarchy&quot; in which Würzel guested on guitar, He was brought in as a songwriter for Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s 1991 &quot;No More Tears&quot; album, providing lyrics for the tracks &quot;Hellraiser,&quot; (which Motörhead later recorded themselves and released as a single), &quot;Desire,&quot; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Change the World&quot; and the single &quot;Mama I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot;. Lemmy noted in several magazine and television interviews that he made more money from the royalties of that one song than he had in his entire time with Motörhead. After being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2000, for which he was hospitalised briefly, Lemmy again appeared with Motörhead at WrestleMania X-Seven playing WWE wrestler Triple H to the ring. Lemmy published his autobiography, &quot;White Line Fever&quot;, in November 2002. In 2005, Motörhead won their first Grammy in the Best Metal Performance category with their cover of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Whiplash&quot;. In the same year he began recording an unreleased solo album titled &quot;Lemmy &amp; Friends&quot;, which was intended to include a collaboration with Janet Jackson.

In 2014, he established his own recording label, Motorhead Music, to promote and develop new talent. Acts he signed to the label and helped develop include Barb Wire Dolls, Budderside, Others, and Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons.

==Film and television==

===Cameo appearances===
Lemmy made appearances in film and television, including 1990 science fiction film &quot;Hardware&quot; and the 1987 comedy &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;, for which Motörhead also recorded the soundtracks including the title song. He appeared as himself in the 1986 &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; episode &quot;More Bad News&quot;, along with fellow heavy metal musicians Ozzy Osbourne, the Scorpions and Def Leppard. In 1984, Motörhead were the musical guests on the TV show &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, in the episode &quot;Bambi&quot;. He appears in the 1994 comedy &quot;Airheads&quot; (in which he is credited as &quot;Lemmy von Motörhead&quot;). Lemmy has a cameo in Ron Jeremy&#x27;s 1994 pornographic film &quot;John Wayne Bobbitt Uncut&quot; as the discoverer of Bobbitt&#x27;s severed penis. The appendage is thrown from the window of a moving car and lands at Lemmy&#x27;s feet who exclaims: &quot;Looks like a dick! Fucking hell! Ah well, it&#x27;s not mine at least.&quot; The film&#x27;s soundtrack also features the Motörhead song &quot;Under the Knife&quot;.

He has also appeared in several movies from Troma Entertainment, including the narrator in 1996&#x27;s &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot; and as himself in both &quot;Terror Firmer&quot; and &quot;Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV&quot;. His last role was portraying the President of the United States in &quot;Return to Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot;. He has a cameo role in the film &quot;Down and Out with the Dolls&quot; (Kurt Voss, 2001). He appears as a lodger who lives in a closet. He appeared on &quot;Down and Dirty with Jim Norton&quot; as the series DJ, and also wrote the theme music. He appeared in a 2001 advertisement for Kit Kat, playing violin as part of a string quartet in a genteel tearoom. In 2015, Lemmy appeared as a central figure in the Björn Tagemose-directed silent film &quot;Gutterdämmerung&quot; opposite Grace Jones, Henry Rollins, Iggy Pop, Tom Araya of Slayer and Eagles of Death Metal&#x27;s Jesse Hughes.

===&quot;Lemmy&quot; film===
The 2010 rockumentary film &quot;Lemmy&quot; was directed and produced by Greg Olliver and Wes Orshoski. It consists of a combination of 16 mm film and HD video footage, produced over three years. It features interviews with friends, peers, and admirers such as Dave Grohl, Slash, Ozzy Osbourne, James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo of Metallica, David Ellefson of Megadeth, Scott Ian of Anthrax, Alice Cooper, Peter Hook of Joy Division/New Order, Dee Snider, Nikki Sixx, Mick Jones of the Clash, Ice-T, Kat Von D, Henry Rollins, Lars Frederiksen of Rancid, Jim Heath of The Reverend Horton Heat, Slim Jim Phantom of the Stray Cats, Mike Inez, Joan Jett, pro skateboarder Geoff Rowley, pro wrestler Triple H, &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke, Jarvis Cocker, Marky Ramone, former Hawkwind bandmates Dave Brock and Stacia, and Steve Vai.

===In video games===
He was the main character in the 16-bit video game &quot;Motörhead&quot;, released for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in 1992. Lemmy also appeared as an unlockable character in the 2009 game &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;. He also provided his voice for the 2009 video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, voicing the Kill Master, a character designed and based on his surname and likeness. Lemmy was also the inspiration for the Mario character Lemmy Koopa, who made his first appearance in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. In the &quot;Victor Vran&quot; &quot;Downloadable content&quot; &quot;Motorhead Through The Ages&quot;, there is a new &quot;Lemmy&#x27;s Outfit&quot; armour. The other Motörhead bandmates&#x27; armour is also available. As an easter egg, a holographic woman in the final level of 2020&#x27;s &quot;DOOM Eternal&quot; proclaims, &quot;Lemmy is God!&quot;. The appearance of the character King Novik from the same video game is also loosely based on facial features of Lemmy. &quot;Deep Rock Galactic&quot; features one of Lemmy&#x27;s hats as a cosmetic called &quot;The Ace of Spades&quot; with the description &quot;In honor of a motoring head.&quot;

==Equipment==

Lemmy positioned his microphone in an uncommonly high position, angled so that he appeared to be looking up at the sky rather than at the audience. He said that it was for &quot;personal comfort, that&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s also one way of avoiding seeing the audience. In the days when we only had ten people and a dog, it was a way of avoiding seeing that we only &quot;had&quot; ten people and a dog.&quot; Inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Lemmy recorded his vocals in the studio in total privacy, meaning he would sing in an enclosed recording booth where no one can see him, not even the producer. 

As a member of Hawkwind, Lemmy first used a Rickenbacker belonging to Dave Anderson. When Anderson failed to show up for a charity gig, Lemmy took his place. Following the departure of Anderson, Kilmister bought a Hopf Studio bass off Hawkwind synth player Del Detmar. He used Rickenbacker basses for most of his career. In September 1996, a Rickenbacker belonging to him was a featured part of the &quot;Bang Your Head&quot; exhibition at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, US. From 1996 onward, Lemmy&#x27;s main bass was a Rickenbacker 4001LK, from a limited edition run of 50 instruments, featuring hand carved body wings, featuring oak leaves, three HB1 humbucker pick-ups and all gold plated hardware. Lemmy had commented that at last Rickenbacker had made decent pick-ups. When asked about the appeal of the Rickenbacker instruments, Lemmy said &quot;The shape. I&#x27;m all for the image — always. If you get one that looks good, you can always mess with the pickups if it sounds bad.&quot;

With Hawkwind Lemmy used a Selmer amplifier. With Motorhead, he got a Marshall Amplification 1992 JMP Super Bass Mark 2 bass stack from 1976, with a 4x15&quot; and a 4x12&quot; cabinet. In 2008, Marshall issued a model dedicated to Lemmy, the 1992LEM, which was available with the same cabinets Lemmy used.

==Musical style==

Lemmy described his style as &quot;I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don&#x27;t play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It&#x27;s not like having a bass player; it&#x27;s like having a deep guitarist.

Lemmy&#x27;s unconventional playing style changed the dynamics of the group&#x27;s rhythm section. Hawkwind drummer Simon King explained that &quot;A lot of the time I play with [guitarist] Dave - he&#x27;ll get into a kind of rhythmic thing and I&#x27;ll follow him so you get this kind of percussion and rhythmic guitar thing going, so Lemmy can loon forward a bit because he&#x27;s very much a front man and gives off a lot of energy, so he can get out front and play a sort of lead on bass which sometimes is very effective&quot;, and Motörhead drummer Taylor echoed the sentiment with &quot;Onstage he&#x27;s difficult to follow cos he&#x27;s not really a bass player. There&#x27;s no solid bass lines to follow. A lot of the time I play more with Eddie [Clarke] than with Lemmy, but he&#x27;s out on his own because he is what he is.&quot;

<doc id="18643" wikidata="Q127900" url="?curid=18643" title="Lactose">
<text>Lactose, or milk sugar, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose and has the molecular formula C12H22O11. Lactose makes up around 2–8% of milk (by mass). The name comes from (gen. ), the Latin word for milk, plus the suffix &quot;-ose&quot; used to name sugars. The compound is a white, water-soluble, non-hygroscopic solid with a mildly sweet taste. It is used in the food industry.

==Structure and reactions==
Lactose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, which form a β-1→4 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is β--galactopyranosyl-(1→4)--glucose. The glucose can be in either the α-pyranose form or the β-pyranose form, whereas the galactose can have only the β-pyranose form: hence α-lactose and β-lactose refer to the anomeric form of the glucopyranose ring alone. Detection reactions for lactose are the Wöhlk- and Fearon&#x27;s test. They can be used to detect the different lactose content of dairy products such as whole milk, lactose free milk, yogurt, buttermilk, coffee creamer, sour cream, kefir, etc.

Lactose is hydrolysed to glucose and galactose, isomerised in alkaline solution to lactulose, and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol, lactitol. Lactulose is a commercial product, used for treatment of constipation.

==Occurrence and isolation==
Lactose comprises about 2–8% of milk by weight. Several million tons are produced annually as a by-product of the dairy industry.

Whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained, for example in the production of cheese. Whey is made up of 6.5% solids, of which 4.8% is lactose, which is purified by crystallisation. Industrially, lactose is produced from whey permeate – whey filtrated for all major proteins. The protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sports nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 60–65% solids and crystallized while cooling. Lactose can also be isolated by dilution of whey with ethanol.

==Metabolism==
Infant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk, which is rich in lactose. The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme lactase (β-D-galactosidase) to digest it. This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits, the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed. Since lactose occurs mostly in milk, in most mammals, the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to weaning; the removal of lactose from the diet removes the metabolic pressure to continue to produce lactase for its digestion.

Many people with ancestry in Europe, West Asia, South Asia, the Sahel belt in West Africa, East Africa and a few other parts of Central Africa maintain lactase production into adulthood due to selection for genes that continue lactase production. In many of these areas, milk from mammals such as cattle, goats, and sheep is used as a large source of food. It was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved. The genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups. By descent, more than 70% of western Europeans can digest lactose as adults, compared with less than 30% of people from areas of Africa, eastern and south-eastern Asia and Oceania. In people who are lactose intolerant, lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas-producing gut flora, which can lead to diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

==Biological properties==
The sweetness of lactose is 0.2 to 0.4, relative to 1.0 for sucrose. For comparison, the sweetness of glucose is 0.6 to 0.7, of fructose is 1.3, of galactose is 0.5 to 0.7, of maltose is 0.4 to 0.5, of sorbose is 0.4, and of xylose is 0.6 to 0.7.

When lactose is completely digested in the small intestine, its caloric value is 4 kcal/g, or the same as that of other carbohydrates. However, lactose is not always fully digested in the small intestine. Depending on ingested dose, combination with meals (either solid or liquid), and lactase activity in the intestines, the caloric value of lactose ranges from 2 to 4 kcal/g. Undigested lactose acts as dietary fiber. It also has positive effects on absorption of minerals, such as calcium and magnesium.

The glycemic index of lactose is 46 to 65. For comparison, the glycemic index of glucose is 100 to 138, of sucrose is 68 to 92, of maltose is 105, and of fructose is 19 to 27.

Lactose has relatively low cariogenicity among sugars. This is because it is not a substrate for dental plaque formation and it is not rapidly fermented by oral bacteria. The buffering capacity of milk also reduces the cariogenicity of lactose.

==Applications==
Its mild flavor and easy handling properties have led to its use as a carrier and stabiliser of aromas and pharmaceutical products. Lactose is not commonly added directly to food, because its low solubility can lead to a gritty mouthfeel. Infant formula is a notable exception, where lactose is added to match the composition of human milk. However, lactose-reduced formulas are increasing in popularity.

One of the undesirable properties of lactose utilization is its low solubility, which can result in crystallization, giving a gritty and sandy mouthfeel in the final product. Usually, in supersaturated solution, sugars tend to crystallize, also forming big agglomerates, depending on the process condition 

Lactose is not fermented by most yeast during brewing, which may be used to advantage. For example, lactose may be used to sweeten stout beer; the resulting beer is usually called a milk stout or a cream stout.

Yeast belonging to the genus &quot;Kluyveromyces&quot; have a unique industrial application, as they are capable of fermenting lactose for ethanol production. Surplus lactose from the whey by-product of dairy operations is a potential source of alternative energy.

Another significant lactose use is in the pharmaceutical industry. Lactose is added to tablet and capsule drug products as an ingredient because of its physical and functional properties (examples are atorvastatin, levocetirizine or thiamazole among many others). For similar reasons, it can be used to dilute illicit drugs such as cocaine or heroin.

==History==
The first crude isolation of lactose, by Italian physician Fabrizio Bartoletti (1576–1630), was published in 1633. In 1700, the Venetian pharmacist Lodovico Testi (1640–1707) published a booklet of testimonials to the power of milk sugar (&#x27;) to relieve, among other ailments, the symptoms of arthritis. In 1715, Testi&#x27;s procedure for making milk sugar was published by Antonio Vallisneri. Lactose was identified as a sugar in 1780 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele.

In 1812, Heinrich Vogel (1778–1867) recognized that glucose was a product of hydrolyzing lactose. In 1856, Louis Pasteur crystallized the other component of lactose, galactose. By 1894, Emil Fischer had established the configurations of the component sugars.

Lactose was named by the French chemist Jean Baptiste André Dumas (1800–1884) in 1843. In 1856, Pasteur named galactose &quot;lactose&quot;. In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot renamed it &quot;galactose&quot;, and transferred the name &quot;lactose&quot; to what is now called lactose. It has a formula of C12H22O11 and the hydrate formula C12H22O11·H2O, making it an isomer of sucrose.

<doc id="18644" wikidata="Q711849" url="?curid=18644" title="Median lethal dose">
<text>In toxicology, the median lethal dose, LD50 (abbreviation for &quot;lethal dose, 50%&quot;), LC50 (lethal concentration, 50%) or LCt50 is a toxic unit that measures the lethal dose of a given substance. The value of LD50 for a substance is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD50 figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance&#x27;s acute toxicity. A lower LD50 is indicative of higher toxicity.

The term LD50 is generally attributed to John William Trevan. The test was created by J. W. Trevan in 1927. The term semilethal dose is occasionally used in the same sense, in particular with translations of foreign language text, but can also refer to a sublethal dose. LD50 is usually determined by tests on animals such as laboratory mice. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved alternative methods to LD50 for testing the cosmetic drug Botox without animal tests.

== Conventions ==
The LD50 is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as milligrams of substance per kilogram of body mass, sometimes also stated as nanograms (suitable for botulinum), micrograms, or grams (suitable for paracetamol) per kilogram. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass). For substances in the environment, such as poisonous vapors or substances in water that are toxic to fish, the concentration in the environment (per cubic metre or per litre) is used, giving a value of LC50. But in this case, the exposure time is important (see below).

The choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD50 is not the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD50. Measures such as &quot;LD1&quot; and &quot;LD99&quot; (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.

Lethal dosage often varies depending on the method of administration; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when intravenously administered. For this reason, LD50 figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., &quot;LD50 i.v.&quot;

The related quantities LD50/30 or LD50/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly within radiation health physics, for ionizing radiation, as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.

A comparable measurement is LCt50, which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m3. ICt50 is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of chemical warfare agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10 L/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration. The concept of Ct was first proposed by Fritz Haber and is sometimes referred to as Haber&#x27;s law, which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100 mg/m3 is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10 mg/m3 (1 × 100 = 100, as does 10 × 10 = 100).

Some chemicals, such as hydrogen cyanide, are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber&#x27;s law. In these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as LC50 and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The material safety data sheets for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber&#x27;s law.

For disease-causing organisms, there is also a measure known as the median infective dose and dosage. The median infective dose (ID50) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral). Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD50s to some test animal. In biological warfare infective dosage is the number of infective doses per cubic metre of air times the number of minutes of exposure (e.g., ICt50 is 100 medium doses - min/m3).

As a measure of toxicity, LD50 is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.

There can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans (&quot;cf.&quot; paracetamol toxicity), and vice versa. For example, chocolate, comparatively harmless to humans, is known to be toxic to many animals. When used to test venom from venomous creatures, such as snakes, LD50 results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many venomous snakes are specialized predators on mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and mongooses may be exceptionally resistant. While most mammals have a very similar physiology, LD50 results may or may not have equal bearing upon every mammal species, such as humans, etc.

== Examples ==
Note: Comparing substances (especially drugs) to each other by LD50 can be misleading in many cases due (in part) to differences in effective dose (ED50). Therefore, it is more useful to compare such substances by therapeutic index, which is simply the ratio of LD50 to ED50.

The following examples are listed in reference to LD50 values, in descending order, and accompanied by LC50 values, {bracketed}, when appropriate.

== Poison scale ==
The LD50 values have a very wide range. The botulinum toxin as the most toxic substance known has an LD50 value of 1 ng/kg, while the most non-toxic substance water has an LD50 value of more than 90 g/kg; a difference of about 1 in 100 billion, or 11 orders of magnitude. As with all measured values that differ by many orders of magnitude, a logarithmic view is advisable. Well-known examples are the indication of the earthquake strength using the Richter scale, the pH value, as a measure for the acidic or basic character of an aqueous solution or of loudness in decibels.
In this case, the negative decimal logarithm of the LD50 values, which is standardized in kg per kg body weight, is considered .

The dimensionless value found can be entered in a toxin scale. Water as the baseline substance is neatly 1 in the negative logarithmic toxin scale.

== Procedures ==
A number of procedures have been defined to derive the LD50. The earliest was the 1927 &quot;conventional&quot; procedure by Trevan, which requires 40 or more animals. The fixed-dose procedure, proposed in 1984, estimates a level of toxicity by feeding at defined doses and looking for signs of toxicity (without requiring death). The up-and-down procedure, proposed in 1985, yields an LD50 value while dosing only one animal at a time.

<doc id="18645" wikidata="Q379764" url="?curid=18645" title="Lactase">
<text>Lactase () is an enzyme produced by many organisms and is essential to the complete digestion of whole milk. It breaks down the sugar lactose into its component parts, galactose and glucose. Lactase is found in the brush border of the small intestine of humans and other mammals. People deficient in lactase or lacking functional lactase may experience the symptoms of lactose intolerance after consuming milk products. Microbial β-galactosidase (often loosely referred to as lactase) can be purchased as a food supplement and is added to milk to produce &quot;lactose-free&quot; milk products.
== Uses ==
=== Food use ===
Lactase is an enzyme that some people are unable to produce in their small intestine. Technology to produce lactose-free milk, ice cream, and yogurt was developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service in 1985. This technology is used to add lactase to milk, thereby hydrolyzing the lactose naturally found in milk, leaving it slightly sweet but digestible by everyone. Without lactase, lactose-intolerant people pass the lactose undigested to the colon where bacteria break it down, creating carbon dioxide which leads to bloating and flatulence.

=== Medical use ===
Lactase supplements can be used to treat lactose intolerance.

=== Industrial use ===
Lactase produced commercially can be extracted both from yeasts such as &quot;Kluyveromyces fragilis&quot; and &quot;Kluyveromyces lactis&quot; and from molds, such as &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;. Its primary commercial use in supplements is to break down lactose in milk to make it suitable for people with lactose intolerance. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not independently evaluated these products.

Lactase (or a similar form of β-galactosidase) is also used to screen for blue white colonies in the multiple cloning sites of various plasmid vectors in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; or other bacteria.

== Mechanism ==
The temperature optimum for human lactase is about 37 °C and the pH optimum is 6.

In metabolism, the β-glycosidic bond in -lactose is hydrolyzed to form -galactose and -glucose, which can be absorbed through the intestinal walls and into the bloodstream. The overall reaction that lactase catalyzes is as follows:

: C12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 + heat.
:lactose + H2O → β--galactose + -glucose

The catalytic mechanism of -lactose hydrolysis retains the substrate anomeric configuration in the products.&lt;ref name = &quot;doi10.1021/bi011727i&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While the details of the mechanism are uncertain, the stereochemical retention is achieved off a double displacement reaction. Studies of &quot;E. coli&quot; lactase have proposed that hydrolysis is initiated when a glutamate nucleophile on the enzyme attacks from the axial side of the galactosyl carbon in the β-glycosidic bond. The removal of the -glucose leaving group may be facilitated by Mg-dependent acid catalysis. The enzyme is liberated from the α-galactosyl moiety upon equatorial nucleophilic attack by water, which produces -galactose.

Substrate modification studies have demonstrated that the 3′-OH and 2′-OH moieties on the galactopyranose ring are essential for enzymatic recognition and hydrolysis. The 3′-hydroxy group is involved in initial binding to the substrate while the 2′- group is not necessary for recognition but needed in subsequent steps. This is demonstrated by the fact that a 2-deoxy analog is an effective competitive inhibitor (Ki = 10mM). Elimination of specific hydroxyl groups on the glucopyranose moiety does not eliminate catalysis.

Lactase also catalyzes the conversion of phlorizin to phloretin and glucose.

Lactase (Lactaid commercially) is used as a medication for lactose intolerance. Since it is an enzyme, its function can be inhibited by the acidity of the stomach. However, it is packaged in an acid-proof tablet, allowing the enzyme to pass through the stomach intact and remain in the small intestine. In the small intestine it can act on ingested lactose molecules, allowing the body to absorb the digested sugar which would otherwise cause cramping and diarrhea. Since the enzyme is not absorbed, it is excreted during the next bowel movement.

== Structure and biosynthesis ==
Preprolactase, the primary translation product, has a single polypeptide primary structure consisting of 1927 amino acids. It can be divided into five domains: (i) a 19-amino-acid cleaved signal sequence; (ii) a large prosequence domain that is not present in mature lactase; (iii) the mature lactase segment; (iv) a membrane-spanning hydrophobic anchor; and (v) a short hydrophilic carboxyl terminus. The signal sequence is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the resulting 215-kDa pro-LPH is sent to the Golgi apparatus, where it is heavily glycosylated and proteolytically processed to its mature form. The prodomain has been shown to act as an intramolecular chaperone in the ER, preventing trypsin cleavage and allowing LPH to adopt the necessary 3-D structure to be transported to the Golgi apparatus.

Mature human lactase consists of a single 160-kDa polypeptide chain that localizes to the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. It is oriented with the N-terminus outside the cell and the C-terminus in the cytosol. LPH contains two catalytic glutamic acid sites. In the human enzyme, the lactase activity has been connected to Glu-1749, while Glu-1273 is the site of phlorizin hydrolase function.

== Genetic expression and regulation ==
In humans, lactase is encoded by a single genetic locus on chromosome 2. It is expressed exclusively by mammalian small intestine enterocytes and in very low levels in the colon during fetal development. Humans are born with high levels of lactase expression. In most of the world&#x27;s population, lactase transcription is down-regulated after weaning, resulting in diminished lactase expression in the small intestine, which causes the common symptoms of adult-type hypolactasia, or lactose intolerance. The &quot;LCT&quot; gene provides the instructions for making lactase. Lactose intolerance in infants (congenital lactase deficiency) is caused by mutations in the &quot;LCT&quot; gene. Mutations are believed to interfere with the function of lactase, causing affected infants to have a severely impaired ability to digest lactose in breast milk or formula.

Some population segments exhibit lactase persistence resulting from a mutation that is postulated to have occurred 5,000–10,000 years ago, coinciding with the rise of cattle domestication. This mutation has allowed almost half of the world&#x27;s population to metabolize lactose without symptoms. Studies have linked the occurrence of lactase persistence to two different single-nucleotide polymorphisms about 14 and 22 kilobases upstream of the 5&#x27;-end of the LPH gene. Both mutations, C→T at position -13910 and G→ A at position -22018, have been independently linked to lactase persistence.

The lactase promoter is 150 base pairs long and is located upstream of the site of transcription initiation. The sequence is highly conserved in mammals, suggesting that critical cis-transcriptional regulators are located nearby. Cdx-2, HNF-1α, and GATA have been identified as transcription factors. Studies of hypolactasia onset have demonstrated that despite polymorphisms, little difference exists in lactase expression in infants, showing that the mutations become increasingly relevant during development. Developmentally regulated DNA-binding proteins may down-regulate transcription or destabilize mRNA transcripts, causing decreased LPH expression after weaning.

<doc id="18646" wikidata="Q261" url="?curid=18646" title="Linkin Park">
<text>Linkin Park is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for the band&#x27;s first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon until Bennington&#x27;s suicide in July 2017, which caused the band to enter an indefinite hiatus. In September 2024, Linkin Park&#x27;s reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.

Categorized mainly as alternative rock and nu metal, Linkin Park&#x27;s earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements. Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album&#x27;s singles&#x27; heavy airplay on MTV led to the singles &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot;, and &quot;In the End&quot; all charting highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the number two spot on the nation&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their second album, &quot;Meteora&quot; (2003), continued the band&#x27;s success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.

The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot; (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Living Things&quot; (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, while their seventh album, &quot;One More Light&quot; (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. The band&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;From Zero&quot;, was released in November 2024.

Linkin Park is among both the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared &quot;the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now&quot; by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;.

==History==

===1996–2000: Foundation and early years===
Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave &quot;Phoenix&quot; Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda&#x27;s makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled &quot;Xero&quot;, released in November 1997. That same month, the band performed their first show, opening for SX-10 and System of a Down at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood. Delson introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&amp;R for Zomba Music, whom he had interned for in college. Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention of record labels. Blue himself was impressed with Xero after watching them play a live show in 1998 but believed the band needed a different vocalist. Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band&#x27;s vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.

After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield&#x27;s replacement, Xero recruited Chester Bennington, a vocalist from Arizona who was recommended by Jeff Blue in March 1999. Bennington, formerly of alternative rock band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. Additionally, the band recruited bassist Kyle Christner on a temporary basis. In May 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online &quot;street team&quot;. In October 1999, Christner was replaced by Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, whom along with Delson, provided bass tracks for the band&#x27;s recordings.

The band still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company as a developing artist in 1999. However, the label advised the band to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid. The band considered the names &quot;Plear&quot; and &quot;Platinum Lotus Foundation&quot; before deciding on &quot;Linkin Park&quot;, a play on and homage to Santa Monica&#x27;s Lincoln Park, now called Christine Emerson Reed Park. They initially wanted to use the name &quot;Lincoln Park&quot;; however, they changed it to &quot;Linkin&quot; to acquire the internet domain &quot;linkinpark.com&quot;.

Bennington and Shinoda both reported that Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park&#x27;s initial recordings. The label&#x27;s A&amp;R was not pleased with the band&#x27;s hip-hop and rock-style approach. An A&amp;R representative suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and exclusively focus on making a rock record. Bennington supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park&#x27;s vision for the album. Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band released their breakthrough album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, that same year.

===2000–2002: &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and &quot;Reanimation&quot;===
Linkin Park released &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; on October 24, 2000. The album, which represented half a decade&#x27;s worth of the band&#x27;s work, was edited by Don Gilmore. &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was a massive commercial success; it sold more than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001. Singles such as &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;One Step Closer&quot; established themselves as staples among alternative rock radio play lists during the year, and &quot;In the End&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;, the band&#x27;s highest to date. Additionally, other singles from the album were featured in films such as &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;, &quot;Little Nicky&quot;, and &quot;Valentine&quot;. &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song &quot;Crawling&quot; and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. MTV awarded the band their Best Rock Video award for &quot;In the End&quot;.

During this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band worked with Jessica Sklar to found their official fan club and street team, &quot;Linkin Park Underground&quot;, in November 2001. Linkin Park also formed their own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other artists such as Cypress Hill, Adema, and Snoop Dogg. Within a year, Linkin Park had performed at over 320 concerts. The experiences and performances of the precocious band were documented in their first DVD, &quot;Frat Party at the Pankake Festival&quot;, which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix, the band began work on a remix album, dubbed &quot;Reanimation&quot;, which would include works from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and non-album tracks. &quot;Reanimation&quot; debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others. &quot;Reanimation&quot; claimed the second spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and sold nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week. &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is also in the RIAA&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Albums&quot;.

===2002–2004: &quot;Meteora&quot;===

Following the success of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and &quot;Reanimation&quot;, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst their saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus&#x27;s studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing their new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks. &quot;Meteora&quot; features a mixture of the band&#x27;s nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park&#x27;s second album debuted on March 25, 2003, and instantly earned worldwide recognition, peaking at No. 1 on the Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart.

&quot;Meteora&quot; sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best-selling album on the Billboard charts at the time. The album&#x27;s singles, including &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, and &quot;Numb&quot;, received significant radio attention. By October 2003, &quot;Meteora&quot; sold nearly three million copies. The album&#x27;s success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit. Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones. The band released an album and DVD, titled &quot;Live in Texas&quot;, which featured some audio and video tracks from the band&#x27;s performances in Texas during the tour. In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world tour titled the &quot;Meteora World Tour&quot;. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., and Story of the Year.

&quot;Meteora&quot; earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV awards for Best Rock Video for &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; and the Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;. Linkin Park also received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year (&quot;Numb&quot;) awards. Although &quot;Meteora&quot; was not nearly as successful as &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, it was the third best selling album in the United States during 2003. The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts. At the same time, the band&#x27;s relationship with Warner Bros. Records was deteriorating rapidly on account of several trust and financial issues. After months of feuding, the band finally negotiated a deal in December 2005.

===2004–2006: Side projects===

Following &quot;Meteora&quot;&#x27;s success, the band worked on many side projects. Bennington appeared on DJ Lethal&#x27;s &quot;State of the Art&quot; and other work with Dead by Sunrise, while Shinoda did work with Depeche Mode, creating the remix song &quot;Enjoy the Silence 04&quot;. In 2004, the band began to work with Jay-Z to produce another remix album, titled &quot;Collision Course&quot;. The album, which featured intermixed lyrics and background tracks from both artists&#x27; previous albums, debuted in November 2004. Shinoda also formed Fort Minor as a side project. With the aid of Jay-Z, Fort Minor released their debut album, &quot;The Rising Tied&quot;, to critical acclaim.

Linkin Park also participated in numerous charitable events, which included raising money to benefit victims of Hurricane Charley in 2004 and later Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The band donated $75,000 to the Special Operations Warrior Foundation in March 2004. They also helped relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims by staging several charity concerts and setting up an additional fund called Music for Relief. The band participated at Live 8, a series of charitable benefit concerts set up to raise global awareness. Alongside Jay-Z, the band performed on Live 8&#x27;s stage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a global audience. The band would later be reunited with Jay-Z at the Grammy Award Ceremony 2006, during which they performed &quot;Numb/Encore&quot;, en route to winning a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. They were joined on stage by Paul McCartney who added verses from the song &quot;Yesterday&quot;. They would later go on to play at the 2006 Summer Sonic music festival, which was hosted by Metallica in Japan.

===2006–2008: &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;===
Linkin Park returned to the recording studios in 2006 to work on new material. To produce the album, the band chose producer Rick Rubin. Despite initially stating the album would debut sometime in 2006, it was delayed until 2007. The band had recorded thirty to fifty songs in August 2006, when Shinoda stated the album was halfway completed. Bennington later added that the new album would stray away from their previous nu metal sound. Warner Bros. Records officially announced that the band&#x27;s third studio album, titled &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;, would be released on May 15, 2007, in the United States. After spending fourteen months working on the album, the band members opted to further refine their album by removing five of the original seventeen tracks. The album&#x27;s title, a reference to the Doomsday Clock, foreshadowed the band&#x27;s new lyrical themes. &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; sold over 623,000 copies in its first week, making it one of the most successful debut week albums in recent years. The album also took the top spot on the Billboard Charts.
The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;What I&#x27;ve Done&quot;, was released on April 2, and premiered on MTV and Fuse within the same week. The single peaked at no. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is also used in soundtrack for the 2007 action film, &quot;Transformers&quot;. Mike Shinoda was also featured on the Styles of Beyond song &quot;Second to None&quot;, which was also included in the film. Later in the year, the band won the &quot;Favorite Alternative Artist&quot; in the American Music Awards. The band also saw success with the rest of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Bleed It Out&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Day&quot;, &quot;Given Up&quot;, and &quot;Leave Out All the Rest&quot;, which were released throughout 2007 and early 2008. The band also collaborated with Busta Rhymes on his single &quot;We Made It&quot;, which was released on April 29.
Linkin Park embarked on a large world tour titled &quot;Minutes to Midnight World Tour&quot;. The band promoted the album&#x27;s release by forming their fourth Projekt Revolution tour in the United States which included many musical acts like My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, HIM, Placebo, and many others. They also played numerous shows in Europe, Asia, and Australia which included a performance at Live Earth Japan on July 7, 2007. and headlining Download Festival in Donington Park, England and Edgefest in Downsview Park, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Bennington stated that Linkin Park plans to release a follow-up album to &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;. However, he stated the band will first embark on a United States tour to gather inspiration for the album. Linkin Park embarked on another Projekt Revolution tour in 2008. The United States Projekt Revolution tour featured Chris Cornell, the Bravery, Ashes Divide, Street Drum Corps and many others. Mike Shinoda announced a live CD/DVD titled &quot;Road to Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes&quot;, which is a live video recording from the Projekt Revolution gig at the Milton Keynes Bowl on June 29, 2008, which was officially released on November 24, 2008.

===2008–2011: &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot;===

In May 2009, Linkin Park announced they were working on a fourth studio album, which was planned to be released in 2010. Shinoda told IGN that the new album would be &#x27;genre-busting,&#x27; while building off of elements in &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;. He also mentioned that the album would be more experimental and &quot;hopefully more cutting-edge&quot;. Bennington also addressed the media to confirm that Rick Rubin would return to produce the new album. The band later revealed the album would be called &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot;. While working on the new album, Linkin Park worked with successful film composer Hans Zimmer to produce the score for &quot;&quot;. The band released a single for the movie, titled &quot;New Divide&quot;. Joe Hahn created a music video for the song, which featured clips from the film. On June 22, Linkin Park played a short set in Westwood Village after the premier of the movie. After completing work for &quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&quot;, the band returned to the studio to finalize their album.

On April 26, the band released an app for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, a game called &quot;8-Bit Rebellion!&quot; It featured the band as playable characters, and a new song called &quot;Blackbirds&quot; which was unlockable by beating the game. The song was also later released as an iTunes bonus track on &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot;.

&quot;A Thousand Suns&quot; was released on September 14. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Catalyst&quot;, was released on August 2. The band promoted their new album by launching a concert tour, which started in October 2010. Other singles from the album include, &quot;Waiting for the End&quot;, &quot;Burning in the Skies&quot;, and &quot;Iridescent&quot;. Furthermore, a documentary about the album&#x27;s production, titled &quot;Meeting of A Thousand Suns&quot;, was available. On August 31, 2010, it was announced that the band would perform &quot;The Catalyst&quot; live for the first time at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010. The venue of the debut live performance of the single was Griffith Observatory, a location used in Hollywood movies.

Linkin Park reached No.9 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Social 50, a chart of the most active artists on the world&#x27;s leading social networking sites. In other &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End charts, the band reached No.92 in the &quot;Top Artists&quot; chart, as well as &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot; reaching No.53 in the Year-End chart of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums and &quot;The Catalyst&quot; reaching No.40 in the Year-End Rock Songs chart.

In July 2011, Bennington told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Linkin Park aims to produce a new album every eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. He later revealed in another interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying &quot;We just kind of began. We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time ... we like the direction that we&#x27;re going in&quot;. On March 28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band is filming a music video for &quot;Burn It Down&quot;, directed by Joe Hahn. Shinoda spoke to &quot;Co.Create&quot; about the album&#x27;s art, saying that it will &quot;blow them [the fans] away ... the average person is not going to be able to look at it and go, I understand that that&#x27;s completely new, like not just the image but the way they made the image is totally new. So there&#x27;s going to be that&quot;.

In April 2012, the band announced that &quot;Living Things&quot; would be the title of their fifth album and called it a &quot;return to form&quot;. Shinoda stated that they chose the title &quot;Living Things&quot; because the album is more about people, personal interactions, and it is far more personal than their previous albums. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Burn It Down&quot;, was released on April 16. The band promoted the album on the 2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus. Other singles from the album include &quot;Lost in the Echo&quot;, &quot;Powerless&quot;, and Castle of Glass&quot;. The band performed &quot;Burn It Down&quot; at 2012 Billboard Music Awards.

The song would later be included on a remix album, entitled &quot;Recharged&quot;, which was released on October 29, 2013. Similar to &quot;Reanimation&quot;, the album features remixes of ten of the songs from &quot;Living Things&quot;, with contributions from other artists, such as Pusha T, Datsik, KillSonik, Bun B, Money Mark, and Rick Rubin.

The album was produced by Shinoda and Delson, who wanted to explore musical elements from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and the band&#x27;s earlier material. Shinoda commented the album is a &quot;90s style of rock record&quot;. He elaborated, &quot;It&#x27;s a rock record. It&#x27;s loud and it&#x27;s rock, but not in the sense of what you&#x27;ve heard before, which is more like &#x27;90s hardcore-punk-thrash.&#x27; The album includes musical contributions from rapper Rakim, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Daron Malakian of System of a Down. The songs &quot;Until It&#x27;s Gone&quot;, &quot;Wastelands&quot;, &quot;Rebellion&quot; (featuring Daron Malakian), and &quot;Final Masquerade&quot; were released as singles from the album. &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; was released on June 13, 2014, in most countries, and later released in the United States on June 17.

Linkin Park performed at Download Festival on June 14, 2014, where they played their debut album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, in its entirety.

The band won the &#x27;Best Rock Band&#x27; and &#x27;Best Live Act&#x27; titles of 2014 on Loudwire&#x27;s Music Awards. &quot;Revolver&quot; ranked &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; as the fourth best album of 2014. In an interview with AltWire on May 4, Shinoda reflected on &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; and commented on Linkin Park&#x27;s future, stating; &quot;I&#x27;m really happy with the reaction from &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, and I think we&#x27;re ready to move somewhere new on the next album, which will be coming [in 2016]&quot;.

Linkin Park collaborated with Steve Aoki on the song &quot;Darker Than Blood&quot; for Aoki&#x27;s album &quot;Neon Future II&quot;, which was released in May 2015.

===2015–2017: &quot;One More Light&quot; and Bennington&#x27;s death===

Linkin Park began working on new material for a seventh studio album in November 2015. Chester Bennington commented on the album&#x27;s direction by stating, &quot;We&#x27;ve got a lot of great material that I hope challenges our fanbase as well as inspires them as much as it has us.&quot; In February 2017, Linkin Park released promotional videos on their social network accounts, which featured Shinoda and Bennington preparing new material for the album. Mike Shinoda stated the band was following a new process when producing the album. Brad Delson elaborated: &quot;We&#x27;ve made so many records and we clearly know how to make a record and we definitely didn&#x27;t take the easy way out this time.&quot;
The first single from the new album was revealed to be titled &quot;Heavy&quot;; it features pop singer Kiiara, marking the first time the band featured a female vocalist on an original song for a studio album. The lyrics for the song were cowritten by Linkin Park with Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter. The single was released on February 16. As they have done in the past, Linkin Park had cryptic messages online in relation to the new album. The album cover was revealed through digital puzzles across social media; the cover features six kids playing in the ocean. The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;One More Light&quot;, was released on May 19, 2017. The promotional singles, &quot;Battle Symphony&quot;, &quot;Good Goodbye&quot; (featuring Pusha T and Stormzy), and &quot;Invisible&quot; were also released prior to the album&#x27;s release.

Bennington died on July 20, 2017; his death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Shinoda confirmed Bennington&#x27;s death on Twitter, writing, &quot;Shocked and heartbroken, but it&#x27;s true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one&quot;. The band had released a music video for their single &quot;Talking to Myself&quot; earlier that day. One day after Bennington&#x27;s death, the band canceled the North American leg of their One More Light World Tour. On the morning of July 24, Linkin Park released an official statement on their website as a tribute to Bennington. On July 28, Shinoda announced that donations made to the band&#x27;s Music for Relief charity would be redirected to the One More Light Fund, which had been set up in Bennington&#x27;s memory. On August 4, when the band was initially scheduled to play on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell&#x27;s twelve-year-old daughter Toni appeared with OneRepublic to perform &quot;Hallelujah&quot; as a tribute to Bennington (who was the godfather to her younger brother, Christopher) and her father. Bennington had previously performed the song at the funeral for Cornell, who had also died from a suicide by hanging two months earlier.
On August 22, Linkin Park announced plans to hold a tribute concert in Los Angeles to honor Bennington. The band thanked fans for their support, stating, &quot;The five of us are so grateful for all of your support as we heal and build the future of Linkin Park&quot;. The title track of &quot;One More Light&quot; was released as a single on October 3.

In November 2017, Linkin Park announced that a live album compiled from their final tour with Bennington, titled &quot;One More Light Live&quot;, would be released on December 15. On November 19, Linkin Park received an American Music Award for Favorite Alternative Artist and dedicated the award to Bennington.

===2017–2023: Hiatus and reissues===
Linkin Park went on hiatus following Bennington&#x27;s death.

On January 28, 2018, Shinoda replied to a tweet from a fan inquiring about his future with Linkin Park, writing, &quot;I have every intention on continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same. We have a lot of rebuilding to do, and questions to answer, so it&#x27;ll take time.&quot; On March 29, however, Shinoda stated that he was uncertain of Linkin Park&#x27;s future when being interviewed by &quot;Vulture&quot;. On April 17, Linkin Park was nominated for three awards at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards but did not win any of them. The band was presented with The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on May 18. On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though what form that takes has yet to be decided. Shinoda stated &quot;I know the other guys, they love to be onstage, they love to be in a studio, and so to not do that would be like, I don&#x27;t know, almost like unhealthy.&quot; When asked about the band&#x27;s future minus Bennington, Shinoda stated, &quot;It&#x27;s not my goal to look for a new singer. If it does happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing Chester.&quot;

Shinoda, Farrell and Hahn began working on new music together, without any public announcement, by 2019, and were later rejoined by Delson, although Bourdon chose not to participate. The band met Dead Sara vocalist Emily Armstrong in 2019, and began working on music with her shortly after, along with various other musicians, including drummer Colin Brittain. On April 28, 2020, bassist Dave Farrell revealed the band was working on new music. On August 13, the band released &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t&quot;, a track that was originally recorded in 1999, and it was included on a 20th anniversary edition of their debut album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, released on October 9. On January 8, 2021, Linkin Park released a remix of &quot;One Step Closer&quot; by American electronic duo 100 gecs. The band revealed it was the first of many new remixes inspired by &quot;Reanimation&quot; to come. On October 29, when asked about the band playing live shows again, Shinoda stated, &quot;Now is not the time [for the band&#x27;s return]. We don&#x27;t have the focus on it. We don&#x27;t have the math worked out. And I don&#x27;t mean that by financially math, I mean that like emotional and creative math.&quot; In April 2022, Shinoda reiterated that the band was not working on a new album, new music, or touring.

In February 2023, the band started an interactive game on their website teasing the 20th anniversary of &quot;Meteora&quot;. On February 6, they revealed a previously unreleased demo, &quot;Lost&quot;, that was formally released on February 10, as the lead single from the reissue of the album, released on April 7. The second single, &quot;Fighting Myself&quot; was released on March 24.

===2023–present: Reformation and &quot;From Zero&quot;===
Unbeknownst to the public, in 2023, the band approached Armstrong and Brittain to reform as Linkin Park to record and release new music and perform the band&#x27;s back catalogue. A previously unreleased song from the &quot;One More Light&quot; sessions, &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, was released on February 23, 2024. This was followed up by the band&#x27;s first greatest hits album, &quot;Papercuts&quot;, which was released on April 12. The collection also includes &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, as well as the first official release of the song &quot;Qwerty&quot;, which first appeared on &quot;LP Underground 6.0&quot; in 2006. On April 30, 2024, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Linkin Park&#x27;s booking agency WME had taken offers for both a potential reunion tour and headlining festival dates to take place in 2025, with the lineup featuring Shinoda, Delson, Farrell, and a female vocalist in place of Bennington.

At a livestreamed event on September 5, Linkin Park announced the band&#x27;s comeback, including Armstrong and Brittain&#x27;s entry into the band. In addition, the band performed and released &quot;The Emptiness Machine&quot;, the lead single of the group&#x27;s eighth album &quot;From Zero&quot;, which was released on November 15, 2024. The band&#x27;s decision to add Armstrong was met with some criticism due to her connections with the Church of Scientology and perceived support of convicted rapist Danny Masterson. The Mars Volta frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who had first directed the aforementioned accusations towards Armstrong back in 2023, stated that Linkin Park was &quot;not doing their due diligence before hiring her&quot;; one of Bennington&#x27;s sons said that Linkin Park &quot;betrayed the trust&quot; of the fanbase with the change. Armstrong responded to the criticism via an Instagram story, stating that she had not been in contact with Masterson since attending his 2020 court appearance and that she condemned his crimes; however, she did not clarify her status with Scientology. Though, BBC noted that the lyrical content she wrote for Dead Sara suggests Armstrong&#x27;s rejection of their teachings.

Linkin Park embarked on a nine-date arena tour across four continents on September 11 at the Kia Forum in Inglewood. After Alex Feder performed in his place at the comeback event, Delson announced his decision to withdraw from touring to concentrate on the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; aspects of the band. The tour is scheduled to conclude in São Paulo, Brazil, on November 16, 2024. According to Shinoda, Linkin Park will be &quot;touring heavily&quot; in 2025. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Heavy Is the Crown&quot;, was released on September 24, 2024, and was used as the main theme for Riot Games&#x27; 2024 &quot;League of Legends&quot; World Championship. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Over Each Other&quot;, was released on October 24, 2024. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Two Faced&quot;, was released on November 13, 2024.

==Philanthropy==
On January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled &quot;Not Alone&quot; as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called &quot;Download to Donate for Haiti&quot; in support of the Haiti Earthquake crisis. On February 10, 2010, Linkin Park released the official music video for the song on their homepage. The single itself was released on October 21, 2011.

On January 11, 2011, an updated version of &quot;Download to Donate for Haiti&quot; was launched, called &quot;Download to Donate for Haiti V2.0&quot;, with more songs to download. For the updated compilation, the band released Keaton Hashimoto&#x27;s remix of &quot;The Catalyst&quot; from the &quot;Linkin Park featuring YOU&quot; contest.

Shinoda designed two T-shirts, in which the proceeds would go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters. Music for Relief released &quot;Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan&quot;, another compilation of songs, in which the proceeds would go to Save the Children. The band released the song titled as &quot;Issho Ni&quot;, meaning &quot;we&#x27;re in this together&quot;, on March 22, 2011, via &quot;Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan&quot;.

In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the &quot;Music for Relief: Concert for the Philippines&quot; in Los Angeles, and raised donations for victims. The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February 15. Other artists during the show included the Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, and the Filharmonic.

==Musical style and influences==
Linkin Park combines elements of metal, industrial, punk, pop, electronic and hip hop. More specifically, the band has been categorized as alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, alternative metal, electronic rock, pop rock, hard rock, and industrial rock. Despite being considered nu metal, the band never considered themselves as such.

Both &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and &quot;Meteora&quot; combine alternative metal, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, and alternative rock sounds with elements of hip hop and electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as &quot;a to an already overdone musical style,&quot; whereas &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described their song &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; as &quot;risky, beautiful art&quot;.

In &quot;Minutes to Midnight,&quot; the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and styles, a process &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; compares to a stage in U2&#x27;s work. Only two songs on the album&#x27;s tracklist feature rap vocals and the majority of the album can be considered as alternative rock.

The vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda played as a major part within Linkin Park&#x27;s music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the rapping vocalist. On Linkin Park&#x27;s third album, &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;, Shinoda sings lead vocals on &quot;In Between&quot;, &quot;Hands Held High&quot;, and on the B-side &quot;No Roads Left&quot;. On numerous songs from the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot;, such as the album&#x27;s singles (&quot;The Catalyst&quot;, &quot;Burning in the Skies&quot;, &quot;Iridescent&quot;), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band&#x27;s musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica. James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Kid A&quot;, while Jordy Kasko of &quot;Review, Rinse, Repeat&quot; likened the album to both &quot;Kid A&quot; and Pink Floyd&#x27;s landmark album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy. He elaborated: &quot;Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively&quot;. One of the record&#x27;s political elements is its samples of speeches by American political figures. &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot; was described as trip hop, electronic rock, ambient, alternative rock, industrial rock, experimental rock, rap rock, and progressive rock.

Their fifth album, &quot;Living Things&quot;, is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in a harder sound by comparison. The band returned to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums on &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, which was described as an alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, rap rock, and rap metal album. Their seventh album, &quot;One More Light,&quot; was described as pop, pop rock and electropop.

Linkin Park&#x27;s influences include Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Machines of Loving Grace, Metallica, Refused, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Descendents, Misfits, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, A Tribe Called Quest, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, N.W.A, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Boogie Down Productions, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, Strife, Helmet, and the Beatles.

Many of the group&#x27;s song lyrics deal with alienation, introversion, and personal struggle and suffering.

==Legacy==
Linkin Park has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. The group&#x27;s first studio album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is one of the best-selling albums in the US (12 million copies shipped) and worldwide (30 million copies sold). &quot;Billboard&quot; estimates that Linkin Park earned US$5 million between May 2011 and May 2012, making them the 40th-highest-paid musical artist. 11 of the band&#x27;s singles have reached the number one position on &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart, the second-most for any artist.

In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. The band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as the &quot;Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now&quot; by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; gave &quot;In the End&quot; and &quot;Final Masquerade&quot; the top two positions on &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s Rock 100 list.

Linkin Park became the first rock band to achieve more than one billion YouTube views. Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Numb&quot; is the third and &quot;In the End&quot; is the sixth &quot;timeless song&quot; on Spotify. The two songs make Linkin Park the only artist to have two timeless songs in the top ten.

&quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; by the group was listed in the 2005 edition of the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, It was also ranked at No. 11 on &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;Hot 200 Albums of the Decade&quot;. In addition the album was included in &quot;Best of 2001&quot; by &quot;Record Collector&quot;, &quot;The top 150 Albums of the Generation&quot; by &quot;Rock Sound&quot; and &quot;50 Best Rock Albums of the 2000s&quot; by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;. The album &quot;Meteora&quot; was included in &quot;Top 200 Albums of the Decade&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot; at No. 36. The album sold 20 million copies worldwide. The collaborative EP &quot;Collision Course&quot; with Jay-Z became the second ever EP to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, going on to sell over 300,000 copies in its first week after Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; in 1994. The album &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;, in the United States, had the biggest first week sales of 2007 at the time, with 625,000 albums sold. In Canada, the album sold over 50,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart. Worldwide, the album shipped over 3.3 million copies in its first four weeks of release.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Jon Caramanica commented Linkin Park &quot;brought the collision of hard rock and hip-hop to its commercial and aesthetic peak&quot; at the beginning of the 2000s. Several rock and non-rock artists have cited Linkin Park as an influence, including Of Mice &amp; Men, One OK Rock, Kutless, My Heart to Fear, Ill Niño, Bishop Nehru, From Ashes to New, Bring Me the Horizon, Spyair, Hardy, I Prevail, Crossfaith, AJ Tracey, the Chainsmokers, the Devil Wears Prada, Steve Aoki, Blackbear, Halsey, Amber Liu, Machine Gun Kelly, Billie Eilish, Starset, the Weeknd, and You Me at Six.

On August 20, 2020, their 20th anniversary, Linkin Park collaborated with virtual reality rhythm game &quot;Beat Saber&quot; to release 11 maps based on their songs.

<doc id="18650" wikidata="Q5459700" url="?curid=18650" title="Flipper (cricket)">
<text>The flipper is a particular bowling delivery used in cricket, generally by a leg spin bowler. In essence it is a back spin ball. Squeezed out of the front of the hand with the thumb and first and second fingers, it keeps deceptively low after pitching and can accordingly be very difficult to play. The flipper is comparable to a riseball in fast-pitch softball. 
With backspin on the ball the Magnus effect results in air travelling over the top of the ball quickly and cleanly while air travelling under the ball is turbulent. The lift so produced causes the ball to drop slower and it travels further than a normal delivery. The slower descent also results in the ball bouncing lower.

The flipper is bowled on the opposite side from a slider, much in the same way that the top-spinner is bowled. On release, the bowler &#x27;pinches&#x27; or clicks the thumb and forefinger, causing the ball to come out underneath the hand. There must be sufficient tension in the wrist and fingers to impart sufficient backspin. In doing so the flipper will float towards the batsman and land on a fuller length than he anticipated, often leaving him caught on the back foot when he wrongly assumes it to be a pullable or a cuttable ball. The back spin or will cause the ball to proceed with very little bounce, though this may be harder to achieve on softer wickets. A series of normal leg spinners or topspinners, with their dropping looping flight, will have the batsman used to the ball pitching on a shorter length. The batsman may wrongly assume that the flipper will drop and loop like a normal overspinning delivery, resulting in the ball pitching under the bat and going on either to hit the stumps or result in leg before wicket.

Much of the effectiveness of the flipper is attributable to the &quot;pop&quot;, that is, the extra pace and change in trajectory that is imparted to the ball when it is squeezed out of the bowler&#x27;s hand.

Occasionally, the term &#x27;flipper&#x27; has been used to describe other types of deliveries. The Australian leg spinner Bob Holland employed a back spinning ball that he simply pushed backwards with the heel of his palm. Sometimes this form of front-hand flipper is called a &quot;zooter&quot;. It is easier to bowl but not as effective as the amount of backspin is much less.

==Bowlers of the flipper==
It was reputedly invented by the Australian leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett. Grimmett became so enamoured with the delivery that at times he bowled it almost as frequently as his stock leg break. The great Don Bradman once remarked to Grimmett that he must have forgotten how to bowl a leg break, as he bowled so many flippers. Bradman was bowled shortly thereafter at a memorial match by Grimmett who produced a perfectly pitched stock ball that turned just enough to remove Bradman&#x27;s off bail. &quot;There y&#x27;are Don, I told you I could bowl a leg break&quot; was Grimmett&#x27;s alleged response.

The flipper was perfected by Cowandilla-raised &quot;leg spinning magician&quot; and Wisden Cricketer of the year, Bruce Dooland, who taught it to Richie Benaud. 

The flipper was the signature delivery of Anil Kumble of India and the Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne in his earlier years, until injury and later shoulder surgery restricted his ability to bowl flippers accurately. Like the googly, it may become more difficult to bowl as a bowler ages due to the flexibility and suppleness it demands from the bowler&#x27;s wrist.

It is difficult to disguise the flipper entirely when bowling, as the hand action is distinctly different from a leg break. When Clarrie Grimmett first began bowling the delivery, batsmen would listen for the telltale clicking sound of his fingers; to compensate, Grimmett would often click the fingers of his non-bowling hand when &quot;not&quot; bowling the flipper to confuse the batsman.

Abdul Qadir of Pakistan achieved great success with the flipper making it one of his signature deliveries, along with him Shane Warne was also arguably the leading exponent of the flipper in more recent times. Anil Kumble of India used the flipper well to his advantage. Brad Hogg of Australia has also used the flipper with great success in limited overs cricket.

<doc id="18653" wikidata="Q173862" url="?curid=18653" title="Lake Nicaragua">
<text>Lake Nicaragua or Cocibolca or Granada (, , or ) is a freshwater lake in Nicaragua. Of tectonic origin and with an area of , it is the largest fresh water lake in Central America, the 19th largest lake in the world (by area) and the tenth largest in the Americas, slightly smaller than Lake Titicaca. With an elevation of above sea level, the lake reaches a depth of . The intermittent Tipitapa River feeds Lake Nicaragua when Lake Managua has high water. Lake Cocibolca is between two other bodies of water, on top is Lake Xolotlán and below is the San Juan River. These body of waters complete the largest International Drainage Basin in Central America.

The lake drains via the San Juan River flowing east to the Caribbean Sea, historically making the city Granada on the northwest shore an Atlantic port, although Granada (as well as the entire lake) is closer to the Pacific Ocean geographically. The Pacific is near enough to be seen from the mountains of the largest island in the lake, Ometepe. The lake has a history of Caribbean pirates who assaulted Granada on three occasions. Before construction of the Panama Canal, a stagecoach line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s Accessory Transit Company connected the lake with the Pacific across the low hills of the narrow Isthmus of Rivas. Plans were made to take advantage of this route to build an Interoceanic Canal, the Nicaragua Canal, but the Panama Canal was built instead. In order to quell competition with the Panama Canal, the U.S. secured all rights to a canal along this route in the Bryan–Chamorro Treaty of 1916. However, since this treaty was mutually rescinded by the United States and Nicaragua in 1970, the idea of another canal in Nicaragua still periodically resurfaced, such as the Ecocanal proposal . In 2014, the government of Nicaragua offered a 50-year concession to the Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company (HKND) to build a canal across Nicaragua at a cost of US$40 billion, with construction expected to begin in December 2014 and complete in 2019. Protests against the ecological and social effects of the canal as well as questions about financing led to doubts about the project, and in the end construction never began.

==Lake ecology==
Lake Nicaragua, despite being a freshwater lake, has sawfish, tarpon, and sharks. Initially, scientists thought the sharks in the lake were an endemic species, the Lake Nicaragua shark (&quot;Carcharhinus nicaraguensis&quot;). In 1961, following comparisons of specimens, it was synonymized with the widespread bull shark (&quot;C. leucas&quot;), a species also known for entering freshwater elsewhere around the world. It had been presumed that the sharks were trapped within the lake, but this was found to be incorrect in the late 1960s, when it was discovered that they were able to jump along the rapids of the San Juan River — which connects Lake Nicaragua with the Caribbean Sea — almost like salmon. As evidence of these movements, bull sharks tagged inside the lake have later been caught in the open ocean (and vice versa), with some taking as little as 7–11 days to complete the journey. Numerous other species of fish live in the lake, including at least 16 cichlids that are endemic to the general region. None of these are strictly endemic to Lake Nicaragua, although &quot;Amphilophus labiatus&quot; is native only to Lake Nicaragua and Lake Managua. A non-native cichlid, a tilapia, is used widely in aquaculture within the lake. Owing to the large amount of waste they produce, and the risk of introducing diseases to which the native fish species have no resistance, they are potentially a serious threat to the lake&#x27;s ecosystem.

The nation&#x27;s largest source of freshwater, Nicaraguans call it or (literally &quot;Sweet Sea&quot;; in Spanish, &quot;freshwater&quot; is ). The lake has sizeable waves driven by the easterly winds blowing west to the Pacific Ocean. The lake holds Ometepe and Zapatera, which are both volcanic islands, as well as the archipelago of the Solentiname Islands. The lake has a reputation for periodically powerful storms.

In the past 37 years, considerable concern has been expressed about the ecological condition of Lake Nicaragua. In 1981 the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) conducted an environmental assessment study and found that half of the water sources sampled were seriously polluted by sewage. It was found that 32 tons (70,000 pounds) of raw sewage were being released into Lake Nicaragua daily. Industry located along the lake&#x27;s shore had been dumping effluent for an extended period of time. Pennwalt Chemical Corporation was found to be the worst polluter. Nicaragua&#x27;s economic situation has hampered the building of treatment facilities nationwide (see: Water supply and sanitation in Nicaragua).

The country&#x27;s worst drought in 32 years took its toll on the lake in 2014; the Nicaraguan government recommended citizens to raise and eat iguanas over chickens to reduce water consumption. Also, plans for the Nicaragua Canal through the lake could lead to saltwater and other contamination during construction and operation of the canal.

==Transport==
The lake was historically important for both passenger and freight shipping. During the California Gold Rush of the late 1840s a trip up the Rio San Juan, through the lake and then across the short overland stretch was one of the two preferred routes to get from the Atlantic to the Pacific (the other being the overland route through Panama) as overland travel through the continental United States prior to the construction of the transcontinental railroad was too dangerous. 

Until the construction of Ometepe Airport the only way to reach the island was by boat. The archipelago of Solentiname is still only reachable by boat. Prior to the construction of a fully paved road to San Carlos (Rio San Juan) travel by boat from Granada via Ometepe to San Carlos was the fastest overland option to reach the Rio San Juan Department.

<text>Labour laws (also spelled as labor laws), labour code or employment laws are those that mediate the relationship between workers, employing entities, trade unions, and the government. Collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between employee, employer, and union.

Individual labour law concerns employees&#x27; rights at work also through the contract for work. are social norms (in some cases also technical standards) for the minimum socially acceptable conditions under which employees or contractors are allowed to work. Government agencies (such as the former US Employment Standards Administration) enforce labour law (legislature, regulatory, or judicial).

==History==
Following the unification of the city-states in Assyria and Sumer by Sargon of Akkad into a single empire ruled from his home city circa 2334 BC, common Mesopotamian standards for length, area, volume, weight, and time used by artisan guilds in each city was promulgated by Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254–2218 BC), Sargon&#x27;s grandson, including for shekels. Code of Hammurabi Law 234 (c. 1755–1750 BC) stipulated a 2-shekel prevailing wage for each 60-gur (300-bushel) vessel constructed in an employment contract between a shipbuilder and a ship-owner.

Law 275 stipulated a ferry rate of 3-gerah per day on a charterparty between a ship charterer and a shipmaster. Law 276 stipulated a 2-gerah per day freight rate on a contract of affreightment between a charterer and shipmaster, while Law 277 stipulated a -shekel per day freight rate for a 60-gur vessel.

In 1816, an archeological excavation in Minya, Egypt (under an Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire) produced a Nerva–Antonine dynasty-era tablet from the ruins of the Temple of Antinous in Antinoöpolis, Aegyptus that prescribed the rules and membership dues of a burial society &quot;collegium&quot; established in Lanuvium, Italia in approximately 133 AD during the reign of Hadrian (117–138) of the Roman Empire.

A &quot;collegium&quot; was any association in ancient Rome that acted as a legal entity. Following the passage of the &quot;Lex Julia&quot; during the reign of Julius Caesar as Consul and Dictator of the Roman Republic (49–44 BC), and their reaffirmation during the reign of Caesar Augustus as &quot;Princeps senatus&quot; and Imperator of the Roman Army (27 BC–14 AD), &quot;collegia&quot; required the approval of the Roman Senate or the Emperor in order to be authorized as legal bodies. Ruins at Lambaesis date the formation of burial societies among Roman Army soldiers and Roman Navy mariners to the reign of Septimius Severus (193–211) in 198 AD.

In September 2011, archeological investigations done at the site of the artificial harbour Portus in Rome revealed inscriptions in a shipyard constructed during the reign of Trajan (98–117) indicating the existence of a shipbuilders guild. Rome&#x27;s La Ostia port was home to a guildhall for a &quot;corpus naviculariorum&quot;, a &quot;collegium&quot; of merchant mariners. &quot;Collegium&quot; also included fraternities of Roman priests overseeing ritual sacrifices, practicing augury, keeping scriptures, arranging festivals, and maintaining specific religious cults.

Labour law arose in parallel with the Industrial Revolution as the relationship between worker and employer changed from small-scale production studios to large-scale factories. Workers sought better conditions and the right to join a labour union, while employers sought a more predictable, flexible and less costly workforce. The state of labour law at any one time is therefore both the product of and a component of struggles between various social forces.

As England was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to face the often appalling consequences of the industrial revolution in a less regulated economic framework. Over the course of the late 18th and early to the mid-19th century the foundation for modern labour law was slowly laid, However, in the early days, there were some unequal aspects, such as the target being limited to women and children and not adult men, as some of the more egregious aspects, of working conditions were steadily ameliorated through legislation. This was largely achieved through the concerted pressure from social reformers, notably Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, and others.

===Child labour===
A serious outbreak of fever in 1784 in cotton mills near Manchester drew widespread public opinion against the use of children in dangerous conditions. A local inquiry presided over by Dr Thomas Percival, was instituted by the justices of the peace for Lancashire, and the resulting report recommended the limitation of children&#x27;s working hours. In 1802, the first major piece of labour legislation was passed − the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act. This was the first, albeit modest, step towards the protection of labour. The act limited working hours to twelve a day and abolished night work. It required the provision of a basic level of education for all apprentices, as well as adequate sleeping accommodation and clothing.

The rapid industrialisation of manufacturing at the turn of the 19th century led to a rapid increase in child employment, and public opinion was steadily made aware of the terrible conditions these children were forced to endure. The Cotton Mills and Factories Act 1819 was the outcome of the efforts of the industrialist Robert Owen and prohibited child labour under nine years of age and limited the working hours to twelve. A great milestone in labour law was reached with the Factories Act 1833, which limited the employment of children under eighteen years of age, prohibited all night work, and, crucially, provided for inspectors to enforce the law. Pivotal in the campaigning for and the securing of this legislation were Michael Sadler and the Earl of Shaftesbury. This act was an important step forward, in that it mandated skilled inspection of workplaces and rigorous enforcement of the law by an independent governmental body.

A lengthy campaign to limit the working day to ten hours was led by Shaftesbury and included support from the Anglican Church. Many committees were formed in support of the cause and some previously established groups lent their support as well. The campaign finally led to the passage of the Factory Act 1847, which restricted the working hours of women and children in British factories to effectively 10 hours per day.

===Working conditions===

These early efforts were principally aimed at limiting child labour. From the mid-19th century, attention was first paid to the plight of working conditions for the workforce in general. In 1850, systematic reporting of fatal accidents was made compulsory, and basic safeguards for health, life and limb in the mines were put in place from 1855. Further regulations, relating to ventilation, fencing of disused shafts, signalling standards, and proper gauges and valves for steam-boilers and related machinery were also set down.

A series of further Acts, in 1860 and 1872 extended the legal provisions and strengthened safety provisions. The steady development of the coal industry, an increasing association among miners, and increased scientific knowledge paved the way for the Coal Mines Act of 1872, which extended the legislation to similar industries. The same Act included the first comprehensive code of regulation to govern legal safeguards for health, life and limb. The presence of more certified and competent management and increased levels of inspection were also provided for.

By the end of the century, a comprehensive set of regulations was in place in England that affected all industries. A similar system (with certain national differences) was implemented in other industrializing countries in the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century.

==Individual labour law==

===Employment terms===

The basic feature of labour law in almost every country is that the rights and obligations of the worker and the employer are mediated through a contract of employment between the two. This has been the case since the collapse of feudalism. Many contract terms and conditions are covered by legislation or common law. In the US for example, the majority of state laws allow for employment to be &quot;at-will&quot;, meaning the employer can terminate an employee from a position for any reason so long as the reason is not explicitly prohibited, and, conversely, an employee may quit at any time, for any reason (or for no reason), and is not required to give notice.

A major issue for any business is to understand the relationship between the worker and the master. There are two types of workers, independent contractors and employees. They are differentiated based on the level of control the master has on them. Workers provided tools and resources, closely supervised, paid regularly, etc., are considered employees of the company. Employees must act in the best interest of the employer.

One example of employment terms in many countries is the duty to provide written particulars of employment with the &quot;essentialia negotii&quot; (Latin for &quot;essential terms&quot;) to an employee. This aims to allow the employee to know concretely what to expect and what is expected. It covers items including compensation, holiday and illness rights, notice in the event of dismissal and job description.

The contract is subject to various legal provisions. An employer may not legally offer a contract that pays the worker less than a minimum wage. An employee may not agree to a contract that allows an employer to dismiss them for illegal reasons.

Intellectual property is the vital asset of the business, employees add value to the company by creating Intellectual Property. As per Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), Intellectual Property is personal property. Intellectual property is used as competitive advantage by big companies to protect themselves from rivalry. Given the conditions, if the worker is in the agent-principal relationship, he is the employee of the company, and if the employee&#x27;s invention is in the scope of employment i.e. if the employee creates a new product or process to increase the productivity and create organizations&#x27; wealth by utilizing the resources of the company, then the Intellectual property solely belongs to the company. New business products or processes are protected under Patents.

There are differing opinions on what constitutes a patentable invention. One area of disagreement is with respect to software inventions, but there have been court cases that have established some precedents. For example, in the case &quot;Diamond v. Diehr&quot; the US Supreme Court decided that Diehr is patent- eligible because they improved the existing technological process, not because they were implemented on a computer.

===Minimum wage===

Many jurisdictions define the minimum amount that a worker can be paid per hour. Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Paraguay, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, the US, Vietnam, Germany (in 2015) and others have laws of this kind. The minimum wage is set usually higher than the lowest wage as determined by the forces of supply and demand in a free market and therefore acts as a price floor. Each country sets its own minimum wage laws and regulations, and while a majority of industrialized countries has a minimum wage, many developing countries do not.

Minimum wages are regulated and stipulated in some countries that lack explicit laws. The US is regulated by the Fair Labor Standards Act and has explicit laws, whereas other countries such as Sweden might lack explicit laws. In Sweden minimum wages are negotiated between the labour market parties (unions and employer organizations) through collective agreements that also cover non-union workers at workplaces with collective agreements.

At workplaces without collective agreements there exist no minimum wages. Non-organized employers can sign substitute agreements directly with trade unions but far from all do. The Swedish case illustrates that in countries without statutory regulation part of the labour market may not have regulated minimum wages, as self-regulation only applies to workplaces and employees covered by collective agreements (in Sweden about 90 per cent of employees).

National minimum wage laws were first introduced in the United States in 1938, Brazil in 1940 India in 1948, France in 1950 and in the UK in 1998. In the European Union, 18 out of 28 member states have national minimum wages as of 2011.

===Living wage===
The living wage is higher than the minimum wage and is designed so that a full-time worker should be able to support themselves and a small family at that wage.

===Hours===

The maximum number of hours worked per day or other time intervals are set by law in many countries. Such laws also control whether workers who work longer hours must be paid additional compensation.

Before the Industrial Revolution, the workday varied between 11 and 14 hours. With the growth of industrialism and the introduction of machinery, longer hours became far more common, reaching as high as 16 hours per day. The eight-hour movement led to the first law on the length of a working day, passed in 1833 in England. It limited miners to 12 hours and children to 8 hours. The 10-hour day was established in 1848, and shorter hours with the same pay were gradually accepted thereafter. The 1802 Factory Act was the first labour law in the UK.

Germany was the next European country to pass labour laws. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s main goal was to undermine the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1878, Bismarck instituted a variety of anti-socialist measures, but despite this, socialists continued gaining seats in the Reichstag. To appease the working class, he enacted a variety of paternalistic social reforms, which became the first type of social security.

In 1883, the Health Insurance Act was passed, which entitled workers to health insurance. The worker paid two-thirds and the employer one-third of the premiums. Accident insurance was provided in 1884, while old-age pensions and disability insurance followed in 1889. Other laws restricted the employment of women and children. These efforts, however, were not entirely successful; the working class largely remained unreconciled with Bismarck&#x27;s conservative government.

In France, the first labour law was voted in 1841. It limited under-age miners&#x27; hours. In the Third Republic labour law was first effectively enforced, in particular after the Waldeck-Rousseau 1884 law legalising trade unions. With the Matignon Accords, the Popular Front (1936–38) enacted the laws mandating 12 days each year of paid vacations for workers and the law limiting the standard workweek to 40 hours.

===Health and safety===
Other labour laws involve safety concerning workers. The earliest English factory law was passed in 1802 and dealt with the safety and health of child labourers in textile mills.

===Discrimination===

Such laws prohibit discrimination against employees, in particular racial discrimination or gender discrimination.

===Dismissal===

Convention no. 158 of the International Labour Organization states that an employee &quot;can&#x27;t be fired without any legitimate motive&quot; and &quot;before offering him the possibility to defend himself&quot;. Thus, on April 28, 2006, after the unofficial repeal of the French First Employment Contract, the Longjumeau (Essonne) &quot;conseil des prud&#x27;hommes&quot; (labour law court) judged the New Employment Contract contrary to international law and therefore &quot;illegitimate&quot; and &quot;without any juridical value&quot;. The court considered that the two-years period of &quot;fire at will&quot; (without any legal motive) was &quot;unreasonable&quot;, and contrary to convention.

===Child labour===
Child labour was not seen as a problem throughout most of history, only disputed with the beginning of universal schooling and the concepts of labourers&#x27; and children&#x27;s rights. Use of child labour was commonplace, often in factories. In England and Scotland in 1788, about two-thirds of persons working in water-powered textile factories were children. Child labour can be factory work, mining or quarrying, agriculture, helping in the parents&#x27; business, operating a small business (such as selling food), or doing odd jobs.

Children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants (where they may also work). Other children do jobs such as assembling boxes or polishing shoes. However, rather than in factories and sweatshops, most child labour in the twenty-first century occurs in the informal sector, &quot;selling on the street, at work in agriculture or hidden away in houses — far from the reach of official inspectors and from media scrutiny.&quot;

==Collective labour law==

Collective labour law concerns the relationship between employer, employee and trade unions. Trade unions (also &quot;labour unions&quot; in the US) are organizations which generally aim to promote the interests of their members. This law regulates the wages, benefits, and duties of the employees, and the dispute management between the company and the trade union. Such matters are often described in a collective labour agreement (CLA).

===Trade unions===

Trade unions are organized groups of workers who engage in collective bargaining with employers. Some countries require unions or employers to follow particular procedures in pursuit of their goals. For example, some countries require that unions poll the membership to approve a strike or to approve using members&#x27; dues for political projects. Laws may govern the circumstances and procedures under which unions are formed. They may guarantee the right to join a union (banning employer discrimination) or remain silent in this respect. Some legal codes allow unions to obligate their members, such as the requirement to comply with a majority decision in a strike vote. Some restrict this, such as &quot;right to work&quot; legislation in parts of the United States.

In the different organization in the different countries trade union discuses with the employee on behalf of employer. At that time trade union discussed or talk with the manpower of the organization. At that time trade union perform his roles like a bridge between the employee and employer.

===Workplace participation===

A legally binding right for workers as a group to participate in workplace management is acknowledged in some form in most developed countries. In a majority of EU member states (for example, Germany, Sweden, and France), the workforce has a right to elect directors on the board of large corporations. This is usually called &quot;codetermination&quot; and currently most countries allow for the election of one-third of the board, though the workforce can have the right to elect anywhere from a single director, to just under a half in Germany. However, German company law uses a split board system, in which a &quot;supervisory board&quot; appoints an &quot;executive board&quot;.

Under the Mitbestimmungsgesetz 1976, shareholders and employees elect the supervisory board in equal numbers, but the head of the supervisory board with a casting vote is a shareholder representative. The first statutes to introduce board-level codetermination were in Britain, however, most of these measures, except in universities, were removed in 1948 and 1979. The oldest surviving statute is found in the United States, in the Massachusetts Laws on manufacturing corporations, introduced in 1919, however, this was always voluntary.

In the United Kingdom, similar proposals were drawn up, and a command paper produced named the Bullock Report (Industrial Democracy) was released in 1977 by the James Callaghan Labour Party government. Unions would have directly elected half of the board. An &quot;independent&quot; element would also be added. However, the proposal was not enacted. The European Commission offered proposals for worker participation in the &quot;fifth company law directive&quot;, which was also not implemented.

In Sweden, participation is regulated through the &quot;Law on board representation&quot;. The law covers all private companies with 25 or more employees. In these companies, workers (usually through unions) have a right to appoint two board members and two substitutes. If the company has more than 1,000 employees, this rises to three members and three substitutes. It is common practice to allocate them among the major union coalitions.

===Information and consultation===
Workplace statutes in many countries require that employers consult their workers on various issues.

===Collective bargaining===
===Collective action===

Strike action is the worker tactic most associated with industrial disputes. In most countries, strikes are legal under a circumscribed set of conditions. Among them may be that:
* The strike is decided on by a prescribed democratic process (wildcat strikes are illegal).
* Sympathy strikes, against a company by which workers are not directly employed, may be prohibited.
* General strikes may be forbidden for example, among public safety workers, to maintain public order.

A boycott is a refusal to buy, sell, or otherwise trade with an individual or business. Other tactics include go-slow, sabotage, work-to-rule, sit-in or en-masse not reporting to work. Some labour law explicitly bans such activity, none explicitly allows it.

Picketing is often used by workers during strikes. They may congregate near the business they are striking against to make their presence felt, increase worker participation and dissuade (or prevent) strike breakers from entering the workplace. In many countries, this activity is restricted by law, by more general law restricting demonstrations, or by injunctions on particular pickets.

For example, labour law may restrict secondary picketing (picketing a business connected with the company not directly with the dispute, such as a supplier), or flying pickets (mobile strikers who travel to join a picket). Laws may prohibit obstructing others from conducting lawful business; outlaw obstructive pickets allow court orders to restrict picketing locations or behaving in particular ways (shouting abuse, for example).

==International labour law==
The labour movement has long been concerned that economic globalization would weaken worker bargaining power, as their employers could hire workers abroad to avoid domestic labour standards. Karl Marx said:

The International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization have been a primary focus among international bodies for regulating labour markets. Conflicts arise when people work in more than one country. EU law has a growing body of workplace rules.

===International Labour Organization===

Following World War I, the Treaty of Versailles contained the first constitution of a new International Labour Organization (ILO) founded on the principle that &quot;labour is not a commodity&quot;, and for the reason that &quot;peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice&quot;. ILO&#x27;s primary role has been to coordinate international labour law by issuing Conventions. ILO members can voluntarily adopt and ratify the Conventions. For instance, the first Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919 required a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members, although the Working Time Directive adopts its principles, subject to individual opt-out. ILO&#x27;s constitution comes from the 1944 Declaration of Philadelphia and under the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work classified eight conventions as core.

These require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions No. 87 and 98), abolition of forced labour (29 and 105), abolition of labour by children before the end of compulsory school (138 and 182), and no discrimination at work (No. 100 and 111). Member compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states&#x27; progress, relying on publicity to create pressure to reform. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or less frequent basis.
Because the ILO&#x27;s enforcement mechanisms are weak, incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organization&#x27;s (WTO) operation has been proposed. WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, contravening WTO rules as recognized by the dispute settlement procedures opens a country to retaliation through trade sanctions. This could include reinstatement of targeted tariffs against the offender.

Proponents have called for a &quot;social clause&quot; to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example, by amending Article XX, which provides an exception that allows imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow comparable action where a WTO member state breaches ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could undermine labour rights, because industries, and therefore workforces could be harmed with no guarantee of reform. Furthermore, it was argued in the 1996 Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that &quot;the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question.&quot;

Some countries want to take advantage of low wages and fewer rules as a comparative advantage to boost their economies. Another contested point is whether business moves production from high wage to low wage countries, given potential differences in worker productivity. Since GATT, most trade agreements have been bilateral. Some of these protect core labour standards. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations, some countries give preference to countries that respect core labour rights, for example under the EC Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.

===Work in multiple countries===

Conflicts of laws (or private international law) issues arise where workers work in multiple jurisdictions. If a US worker performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark (a &quot;peripatetic&quot; worker) an employer may seek to characterize the employment contract as governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a UK labour law case, &quot;Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd&quot; Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of Halliburton. He was dismissed by a supervisor based in Egypt. He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK Employment Rights Act 1996 he would have a right to claim unfair dismissal, but the Act left open the question of the statute&#x27;s territorial scope. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that an expatriate worker, would be subject to UK rules if the worker could show a &quot;close connection&quot; to the UK, which was found in Rabat&#x27;s case.

This fits within the general framework in the EU. Under EU Rome I Regulation article 8, workers have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. They may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.

It is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the Brussels I Regulation article 19, this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought or is engaged there.

===EU law===
The European Union has extensive labour laws that officially exclude, according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, matters around direct wage regulation (e.g. setting a minimum wage), the fairness of dismissals and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the Working Time Directive guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the Equality Framework Directive prohibits all forms of discrimination and the Collective Redundancies Directive requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place on decisions about economic dismissals.

The European Court of Justice has recently extended the Treaties provisions via case law. Trade unions have sought to organize across borders in the same way that multinational corporations have organized production globally. Unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. This coordination was challenged in the European Union in two controversial decisions. In &quot;Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union&quot; a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden. The local union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective bargaining agreement.

Under the Posted Workers Directive, article 3 lays down minimum standards for foreign workers so that workers receive at least the minimum rights that they would have in their home country in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) says that this &quot;shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers&quot;. Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g., in Latvian law) by the host state&#x27;s legislation or a collective agreement.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that only the local state could raise standards beyond its minimum for foreign workers. Any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would infringe the business&#x27; freedom under TFEU article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the Rome I Regulation, which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards.

In &quot;The Rosella&quot;, the ECJ held that a blockade by the International Transport Workers Federation against a business that was using an Estonian flag of convenience (i.e., saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business&#x27; right of free establishment under TFEU article 49. The ECJ said that it recognized the workers&#x27; &quot;right to strike&quot; in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business&#x27; establishment.

== National labour laws ==
=== Angola ===
=== Australia ===
The Fair Work Act of 2009 provides the regulations governing Australian workplaces and employers. Australia has a minimum wage and workplace conditions overseen by the Fair Work Commission.

=== Benin ===
=== Belgium ===
=== Canada ===

In Canadian law, &quot;labour law&quot; refers to matters connected with unionized workplaces, while &quot;employment law&quot; deals with non-unionized employees.

In 2017, Premier Brad Wall announced that Saskatchewan&#x27;s government is to cut 3.5 per cent from its workers and officers&#x27; wages in 2018. This salary cut includes MLA ministers and the Premier&#x27;s office staff along with all people employed by the government. Unpaid days off will also be implemented as well as limiting overtime to assist the wage cut.

=== China ===
In China the basic labour laws are the &quot;Labour Law of People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (1994) and the &quot;Labour Contract Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (adopted at the 10th National People&#x27;s Congress, effective 2008). The administrative regulations enacted by the State Council, the ministerial rules and the judicial explanations of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court stipulate detailed rules concerning various aspects of employment. The government-controlled All China Federation of Trade Unions is the sole legal labour union. Strikes are formally legal, but in practice are discouraged.

=== Czech Republic ===
In Czech Republic, the relevant regulation is called the Labour Code (). The new labour code of the Czech Republic No.262/2006 Sb. effective from 1 January 2007, superseded the Code of 65/1965.

=== France ===
In France, the first labour laws were Waldeck Rousseau&#x27;s laws passed in 1884. Between 1936 and 1938 the Popular Front enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each year of paid vacation for workers, and a law limited the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The Grenelle accords negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise. The minimum wage was increased by 25%.

In 2000, Lionel Jospin&#x27;s government enacted the 35-hour workweek, reduced from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister Dominique de Villepin enacted the New Employment Contract (CNE). Addressing the demands of employers asking for more flexibility in French labour laws, the CNE sparked criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it favoured contingent work. In 2006, he then attempted to pass the First Employment Contract (CPE) through a vote by emergency procedure, but that was met by students and unions&#x27; protests. President Jacques Chirac finally had no choice but to repeal it.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, the main act on the Labour Law is the Polish Labour Code from 1974. Since its introduction into the legal system the act is constantly being adapted and updated to the current reality of the labour market in Poland. The basic form of employment in Poland is an employment contract, which can be concluded for a probation period, a definite period of time or an indefinite period of time. The Polish Labour Code provides regulations on employee benefits, annual leave, termination of the employment contract, discrimination in the workplace, disciplinary liability and many other employment-related issues. Polish employment contracts can be terminated in many ways, e.g. in a disciplinary mode, by a termination with a notice period or by a mutual agreement of both parts.

Labor law in Poland is closely related to the social insurance system, which is crucial for both employees and employers. According to Polish regulations, employers are obligated to register employees with ZUS (Social Insurance Institution) and to pay contributions for pension, disability, accident, sickness, and health insurance. These insurances provide workers with protection in case of illness, work-related accidents, and guarantee benefits for old age or in case of incapacity to work. Thanks to these regulations, employees can enjoy a wide range of social and economic rights, which are an important aspect of social and financial stability in the country.

=== India ===

Over fifty national and many more state-level laws govern work in India. So for instance, a permanent worker can be terminated only for proven misconduct or habitual absence. In the Uttam Nakate case, the Bombay High Court held that dismissing an employee for repeated sleeping on the factory floor was illegal – the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of India two decades later. In 2008, the World Bank criticized the complexity, lack of modernization and flexibility in Indian regulations.

In the Constitution of India from 1950, articles 14–16, 19(1)(c), 23–24, 38, and 41-43A directly concern labour rights. Article 14 states everyone should be equal before the law, article 15 specifically says the state should not discriminate against citizens, and article 16 extends a right of &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; for employment or appointment under the state. Article 19(1)(c) gives everyone a specific right &quot;to form associations or unions&quot;. Article 23 prohibits all trafficking and forced labour, while article 24 prohibits child labour under 14 years old in a factory, mine or &quot;any other hazardous employment&quot;.

Articles 38–39, and 41-43A, like all rights listed in Part IV of the Constitution are not enforceable by courts, rather than creating an aspirational &quot;duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws&quot;.[3] The original justification for leaving such principles unenforceable by the courts was that democratically accountable institutions ought to be left with discretion, given the demands they could create on the state for funding from general taxation, although such views have since become controversial. Article 38(1) says that in general the state should &quot;strive to promote the welfare of the people&quot; with a &quot;social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of national life.

Article 38(2) says the state should &quot;minimise the inequalities in income&quot; and based on all other statuses. Article 41 creates a &quot;right to work&quot;, which the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 attempts to put into practice. Article 42 requires the state to &quot;make provision for securing just and human conditions of work and for maternity relief&quot;. Article 43 says workers should have the right to a living wage and &quot;conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life&quot;. Article 43A, inserted by the Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India in 1976,[4] creates a constitutional right to codetermination by requiring the state to legislate to &quot;secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings&quot;. The recently released New Labour Codes 2022 mentions that organizations can convert 9-hour shifts to 12-hour shifts and provide three days of leave every week. The 4-day workweek policy will be effective from 1 July 2022.

=== Indonesia ===
Indonesia essentially rebuilt its labour law system in the early 2000s following regime change and with support of the ILO. These three statutes constituted a new legislative framework for industrial relations:

1.     Law No. 21 of 2000 on Trade Unions, which allowed free unionization; and

2.     Law No. 13 of 2003 on Manpower, which legislated other minimum labour rights; and

3.     Law No. 2 of 2004 on Industrial Relations Disputes Settlement, established a new industrial relations dispute resolution system.

=== Iran ===

Iran has not ratified the two basic Conventions of the International Labour Organization on freedom of association and collective bargaining and one abolishing child labour.

=== Israel ===
=== Japan ===
=== Lithuania ===
Lithuania began the work of rewriting the employment laws in 1996 and the Labour Code () bill was completed in 2001. It was heavily inspired by the Hungarian, Czech as well Polish laws and incorporated the vast majority of the European Union regulations. The new labour code was formally enacted in 2002. Another major reform of the labour code was implemented in 2016, bringing more flexibility, yet balancing it with protection for employees. The Labour Code 2016 formally entered force on 1 July 2017.

=== Mexico ===

Mexican labour law reflects the historic interrelation between the state and the Confederation of Mexican Workers. The confederation is officially aligned with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI). While the law promises workers the right to strike and to organize, in practice it is difficult or impossible for independent unions to organize.

===Singapore===
Singapore has a &quot;minimum legal obligation&quot; rule which applies to employment contracts and in other fields of contracting, and limits damages payments for breach of contract. The rule applies in wrongful dismissal cases: generally, its effect would be to limit an employee&#x27;s damages to the minimum notice period under which the employer could properly have dismissed the employee. Various &quot;general principles&quot; have been identified which apply to the summary dismissal of employees on grounds of misconduct.

=== South Africa ===

South African labour law is regulated by the Department of Employment and Labour and is based on the Labour Relations Act (LRA) 66 of 1995, which regulates the relationship between and rights of employers, employees and trade unions. The LRA also gives effect to Section 23 of the Constitution. The LRA lays out the procedures for dispute resolution via the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and establishes the Labour Court and Labour Appeal Court as superior courts with exclusive jurisdiction to decide matters arising from the Act.

The Labour Relations Act also regulates the issue of fairness, not only in termination but during employment. In 1998, most of the laws on unfair labour practices were removed from the Labour Relations Act and placed into the newly formed Employment Equity Act (EEA). The EEA also deals with issues such as fairness regarding a worker&#x27;s human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status or disability, as well as the issue of affirmative action.

Prior to 1995, an employee could be dismissed in terms of the contract of employment, which could permit any reason for dismissal. Since 1995, an employee may be dismissed only for misconduct, operational reasons and incapacity, given that procedural fairness is maintained. The Labour Relations Act 1995 is a pivotal piece of legislation, as it recognises the need for fast and easy access to justice in labour disputes. The Industrial Court had the status of a High Court, and therefore was not accessible to all labourers.

The Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA), the Health and Safety Act and the Skills Development Act, must be read with the EEA. The Skills Development Act provides that a small percentage of a labourer&#x27;s salary must be contributed to the Department of Labour, enabling certain workshops to be run which are designed to develop skills.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden many workplace issues such as working hours, minimum wage and right to overtime compensation are regulated through collective bargaining agreements in accordance with the Swedish model of &quot;self-regulation&quot;, i.e. regulation by the labour market parties themselves in contrast to &quot;state regulation&quot; (labour laws). A notable exception is the Employment Protection act which regulates employment contracts and extensive employees&#x27; rights to employment under certain conditions.

=== Switzerland ===
The labour law of Switzerland covers all standards governing the employment of some kind. The regulation of the employment by private employers is largely harmonized at the federal level, while public-sector employment still prevails a variety of cantonal laws. In particular, the civil standardization is distributed to a variety of laws. Of greater importance, particularly the new Federal Constitution of 1999, the Code of Obligations, the Labour Code as well as in the public sector, the Federal Personnel Act.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Factory Acts (first one in 1802, then 1833) and the 1823 Master and Servant Act were the first laws regulating labour relations in the United Kingdom. Most employment law before 1960 was based upon contract law. Since then there has been a significant expansion primarily due to movements for equality and the legal requirements imposed by the UK&#x27;s former membership of the European Union. UK employment law comes from Acts of Parliament, secondary legislation (made by a Secretary of State under an Act of Parliament), case law (developed by various courts), and retained Community law following the UK&#x27;s departure from the EU.

The first significant expansion was the Equal Pay Act 1970, brought in to try to ensure pay equality for women in the workplace. Since 1997, changes in UK employment law include enhanced maternity and paternity rights, the introduction of a National Minimum Wage and the Working Time Regulations, which covers working time, rest breaks and the right to paid annual leave. Discrimination law has been tightened, with protection from discrimination now available on the grounds of age, religion or belief and sexual orientation as well as gender, race and disability.

=== United States ===


The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 set the maximum standard work week to 44 hours. In 1950 this was reduced to 40 hours. A green card entitles immigrants to work, without requirement a separate work permit. Despite the 40-hour standard maximum work week, some lines of work require more than 40 hours. For example, farm workers may work over 72 hours a week, followed by at least 24 hours off. Exceptions to the break period exist for certain harvesting employees, such as those involved in harvesting grapes, tree fruits and cotton.

Professionals, clerical (administrative assistants), technical, and mechanical employees cannot be terminated for refusing to work more than 72 hours in a work week.
These ceilings, combined with a competitive job market, often motivate American workers to work more hours. American workers on average take the fewest days off of any developed country.

The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution limit the power of the federal and state governments to discriminate. The private sector is not directly constrained by the Constitution, but several laws, particularly the Civil Rights Act of 1964, limit the private sector discrimination against certain groups. The Fifth Amendment has an explicit requirement that the Federal Government not deprive individuals of &quot;life, liberty, or property&quot;, without due process of law and an implicit guarantee that each person receive equal protection of the law.

The Fourteenth Amendment explicitly prohibits states from violating an individual&#x27;s rights of due process and equal protection. Equal protection limits the State and Federal governments&#x27; power to discriminate in their employment practices by treating employees, former employees, or job applicants unequally because of membership in a group, like a race, religion or sex. Due process protection requires that employees have a fair procedural process before they are terminated if the termination is related to a &quot;liberty&quot;, like the right to free speech, or a property interest.

The National Labor Relations Act, enacted in 1935 as part of the New Deal legislation, guarantees workers the right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.

The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination, prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labour organizations, training programmes and employment agencies based on race or colour, religion, sex and national origin. Retaliation is also prohibited by Title VII against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the damages available to Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to jury trial.

=== Halakhah (Jewish religious law) ===
The beginnings of halakhic labour law are in the Bible, in which two commandments refer to this subject: the law against delayed wages (Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:14–15) and the worker&#x27;s right to eat the employer&#x27;s crops (Deut. 23:25–26). The Talmudic law—in which labour law is called &quot;laws of worker hiring&quot;—elaborates on many more aspects of employment relations, mainly in Tractate Baba Metzi&#x27;a. In some issues the Talamud, following the Tosefta, refers the parties to the customary law: &quot;All is as the custom of the region [postulates]&quot;.

Modern halakhic labour law developed very slowly. Rabbi Israel Meir Hacohen (the Hafetz Hayim) interprets the worker&#x27;s right for timely payment in a tendency that clearly favours the employee over the employer, but does not refer to new questions of employment relations. Only in the 1920s we find the first halakhic authority to tackle the questions of trade unions (that could easily be anchored in Talmudic law) and the right of strike (which is quite problematic in terms of Talmudic law).

Rabbis A.I Kook and B.M.H. Uziel tend to corporatist settling of labour conflicts, while Rabbi Moshe Feinstein adopts the liberal democratic collective bargaining model. Since the 1940s the halakhic literature on labour law was enriched by books and articles that referred to growing range of questions and basically adopted the liberal democratic approach.

<text>Louis Riel (; ; 22 October 1844 – 16 November 1885) was a Canadian politician, a founder of the province of Manitoba, and a political leader of the Métis people. He led two resistance movements against the Government of Canada and its first prime minister John A. Macdonald. Riel sought to defend Métis rights and identity as the Northwest Territories came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence. 

The first resistance movement led by Riel was the Red River Resistance of 1869–1870. The provisional government established by Riel ultimately negotiated the terms under which the new province of Manitoba entered the Canadian Confederation. However, while carrying out the resistance, Riel had a Canadian nationalist, Thomas Scott, executed. Riel soon fled to the United States to escape prosecution. He was elected three times as member of the House of Commons, but, fearing for his life, never took his seat. During these years in exile he came to believe that he was a divinely chosen leader and prophet. He married in 1881 while in exile in the Montana Territory.

In 1884 Riel was called upon by the Métis leaders in Saskatchewan to help resolve longstanding grievances with the Canadian government. He returned to Canada and led an armed conflict with government forces: the North-West Rebellion of 1885. Defeated at the Battle of Batoche, Riel was imprisoned in Regina where he was convicted at trial of high treason. Despite protests, popular appeals and the jury&#x27;s call for clemency, Riel was executed by hanging. Riel was seen as a heroic victim by French Canadians; his execution had a lasting negative impact on Canada, polarizing the new nation along ethno-religious lines. The Métis were marginalized in the Prairie provinces by the increasingly English-dominated majority. A long-term effect of these actions was the bitter alienation felt by Francophones across Canada, and their anger against the repression by their countrymen.

Riel&#x27;s historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous religious fanatic and rebel opposed to the Canadian nation, and, by contrast, as a charismatic leader intent on defending his Métis people from the unfair encroachments by the federal government eager to give Orangemen-dominated Ontario settlers priority access to land. Riel has received among the most formal organizational and academic scrutiny of any figure in Canadian history.

==Early life==

The Red River Settlement was a Rupert&#x27;s Land territory administered by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). At the mid-19th-century the settlement was largely inhabited by Métis people of mixed First Nations-European descent. Their ancestors were for the most part Scottish and English men married to Cree women, and French-Canadian men married to Saulteaux (plains Ojibwe) women.

Louis Riel was born in 1844 in his grandparents&#x27; small one-room home in St-Boniface near the fork of the Red and Seine rivers. Riel was the eldest of eleven children in a locally well-respected family. His father, who was of Franco-Chipewyan Métis descent, had gained prominence in this community by organizing a group that supported Guillaume Sayer, a Métis arrested and tried for challenging the HBC&#x27;s historical trade monopoly. Sayer&#x27;s eventual release due to agitations by Louis Sr.&#x27;s group effectively ended the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore well known in the Red River area. His mother was the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière and Marie-Anne Gaboury, one of the earliest White families to settle in Red River in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong family ties.

Riel began his schooling at age seven, and by age ten he attended St. Boniface Catholic schools, including eventually a school run by the French Christian Brothers. At age thirteen he came to the attention of Bishop Alexandre Taché, who was eagerly promoting the priesthood for talented young Métis. In 1858 Taché arranged for Riel to attend the Petit Séminaire de Montréal. Descriptions of him at the time indicate that he was a fine scholar of languages, science, and philosophy. While a good student, he was also hot-tempered, extreme in his views, intolerant of criticism and opposition, and not opposed to arguing with his teachers.

Following news of his father&#x27;s premature death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time, he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave, following breaches of discipline. During Riel&#x27;s period of mourning of his father, he believed that Louis Riel was dead and he himself was David Mordecai, a Jew from Marseilles, and as David, he was not eligible to the immense inheritance of his father (which, in fact, was of little value). Seized with religious fervour, he announced that he was going to form a new religious movement. He remained in Montreal for over a year, living at the home of his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fiancée&#x27;s family opposed her involvement with a Métis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant and, by early 1866, he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends said later that he worked odd jobs in Chicago, while staying with poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine, and that he was briefly employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River settlement on 26 July 1868.

==Red River Resistance==

The majority population of the Red River had historically been Métis and First Nations people. Upon his return, Riel found that religious, nationalistic, and racial tensions were exacerbated by an influx of Anglophone Protestant settlers from Ontario. The political situation was also uncertain, as ongoing negotiations for the transfer of Rupert&#x27;s Land from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to Canada had not addressed the political terms of transfer. Bishop Taché and the HBC governor William Mactavish both warned the Macdonald government that the lack of consultation and consideration of Métis views would precipitate unrest. Finally, the Canadian minister of public works, William McDougall, ordered a survey of the area. The arrival of a survey party on 20 August 1869 increased anxiety among the Métis as the survey was being carried out as a grid system of townships (an American system) that cut across existing Métis river lots.

In late August, Riel denounced the survey in a speech, and on 11 October 1869, the survey&#x27;s work was disrupted by a group of Métis that included Riel. This group organized itself as the &quot;National Committee of the Métis&quot; on 16 October, with Riel as secretary and John Bruce as president. When summoned by the HBC-controlled Council of Assiniboia to explain his actions, Riel declared that any attempt by Canada to assume authority would be contested unless Ottawa had first negotiated terms with the Métis. Nevertheless, the non-bilingual McDougall was appointed the lieutenant governor-designate, and attempted to enter the settlement on 2 November. McDougall&#x27;s party was turned back near the Canada–US border, and on the same day, Métis led by Riel seized Fort Garry.

On 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones to attend a convention alongside Métis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded as a condition of union. Much of the settlement came to accept the Métis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, this group was led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms. Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his home and store. Riel ordered Schultz&#x27;s home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.

===Provisional government===
Hearing of the unrest, Ottawa sent three emissaries to the Red River, including HBC representative Donald Alexander Smith. While they were en route, the Métis National Committee declared a provisional government on 8 December, with Riel becoming its president on 27 December.

Meetings between Riel and the Ottawa delegation took place on 5 and 6 January 1870. When these proved fruitless, Smith chose to present his case in a public forum. After large meetings on 19 and 20 January, Riel suggested the formation of a new convention split evenly between Francophone and Anglophone settlers to consider Smith&#x27;s proposals. On 7 February, a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis. The provisional government established by Louis Riel published its own newspaper titled &quot;New Nation&quot; and established the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia to pass laws. The Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia was the first elected government at the Red River Settlement and functioned from 9 March to 24 June 1870. The assembly had 28 elected representatives, including a president, Louis Riel, an executive council (government cabinet), adjutant general (chief of military staff), chief justice and clerk.

===Thomas Scott&#x27;s execution===
Despite the progress on the political front, the Canadian party continued to plot against the provisional government. They attempted to recruit supporters to overthrow Riel. However, they suffered a setback on 17 February, when forty-eight men, including Boulton and Thomas Scott, were arrested near Fort Garry.
Boulton was tried by a tribunal headed by Ambroise-Dydime Lépine and sentenced to death for his interference with the provisional government. He was pardoned, but Scott interpreted this as weakness by the Métis, who he regarded with open contempt. After Scott repeatedly quarreled with his guards, they insisted that he be tried for insubordination. At his court martial he was found guilty and was sentenced to death. Riel was repeatedly entreated to commute the sentence, but Riel responded, &quot;I have done three good things since I have commenced: I have spared Boulton&#x27;s life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott.&quot;

Scott was soon executed by a Métis firing squad on 4 March. Riel&#x27;s motivations have been the cause of much speculation, but his justification was that he felt it necessary to demonstrate to the Canadians that the Métis must be taken seriously. Protestant Canada did take notice, swore revenge, and set up a &quot;Canada First&quot; movement to mobilize their anger. Riel biographer Lewis Thomas noted that &quot;as people then and later have said, it was Riel&#x27;s one great political blunder&quot;.

===Creation of Manitoba and the Wolseley expedition===
The delegates representing the provisional government arrived in Ottawa in April. Although they initially met with legal difficulties arising from the execution of Scott, they soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier. The parties agreed on several of the demands in the list of rights, including language, religious, and land rights (excepting ownership of public lands). This agreement formed the basis for the Manitoba Act, which formally admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation; the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia unanimously supported joining. However, the negotiators could not secure a general amnesty for the provisional government; Cartier held that this was a question for the British government.

As a means of exercising Canadian authority in the settlement and dissuading American expansionists, a Canadian military expedition under Colonel Garnet Wolseley was dispatched to the Red River. Although the government described it as an &quot;errand of peace&quot;, Riel learned that Canadian militia elements in the expedition meant to lynch him.

==Intervening years==

===Amnesty question===
It was not until 2 September 1870 that the new Lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the establishment of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia threatening his life, Riel fled to the safety of the St. Joseph&#x27;s mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. The results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871.

The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O&#x27;Donoghue. Archibald issued a call to arms in October, and assured Riel that if he participated he would not be arrested. Riel organized several companies of Métis troops for the defense of Manitoba. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel&#x27;s hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been effected.

When this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec–Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of C$1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel&#x27;s family.

Nevertheless, by late June, Riel was back in Manitoba and was soon persuaded to run as a Member of Parliament for the electoral district of Provencher. However, following the early September defeat of George-Étienne Cartier in his home riding in Quebec, Riel stood aside so that Cartier—on record as being in favour of amnesty for Riel—might secure a seat in Provencher. While Cartier won by acclamation, Riel&#x27;s hopes for a swift resolution to the amnesty question were dashed following Cartier&#x27;s death on 20 May 1873. In the ensuing by-election in October 1873, Riel ran unopposed as an Independent, although he had again fled, a warrant having been issued for his arrest in September. Lépine was not so lucky; he was captured and faced trial.

Riel made his way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the House of Commons—Edward Blake, the Premier of Ontario, had announced a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest. Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great Pacific Scandal debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the interim prime minister, and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of Lisgar. Riel prevailed again in the resulting by-election and was again expelled.

===Exile and mental illness===
During this period, Riel had been staying with the Oblate fathers in Plattsburgh, New York, who introduced him to parish priest Fabien Martin &quot;dit&quot; Barnabé in the nearby village of Keeseville. It was here that he received news of Lépine&#x27;s fate: following his trial for the murder of Scott, which had begun on 13 October 1874, Lépine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for amnesty for both Lépine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the Governor General Lord Dufferin commuted Lépine&#x27;s sentence in January 1875. This opened the door for Mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for Riel, on the condition that he remain in exile for five years.

During his time of exile, Riel was primarily concerned with religion rather than politics. Much of these emerging religious beliefs were based on a supportive letter dated 14 July 1875 that he received from Montreal&#x27;s Bishop Ignace Bourget. His mental state deteriorated, and following a violent outburst he was taken to Montreal, where he was under the care of his uncle, John Lee, for a few months. But after Riel disrupted a religious service, Lee arranged to have him committed in an asylum in Longue-Pointe on 6 March 1876 under the assumed name &quot;Louis R. David&quot;. Fearing discovery, his doctors soon transferred him to the Beauport Asylum near Quebec City under the name &quot;Louis Larochelle&quot;. While he suffered from sporadic irrational outbursts, he continued his religious writing, composing theological tracts with an admixture of Christian and Judaic ideas. He consequently began calling himself &quot;Louis David Riel, Prophet, Infallible Pontiff and Priest King&quot;.

Nevertheless, he slowly recovered, and was released from the asylum on 23 January 1878 with an admonition to lead a quiet life. He returned for a time to Keeseville, where he became involved in a passionate romance with Evelina Martin &quot;dite&quot; Barnabé, sister of Father Fabien. He asked her to marry him before moving west &quot;with the avowed intention of establishing himself&quot; before sending for her; however, their correspondence ended abruptly.

===Montana and family life===

In the fall of 1878, Riel returned to St. Paul, and briefly visited his friends and family. This was a time of rapid change for the Métis of the Red River—the bison on which they depended were becoming increasingly scarce, the influx of settlers was ever-increasing, and much land was sold to unscrupulous land speculators. Like other Red River Métis who had left Manitoba, Riel headed further west to start a new life. Travelling to the Montana Territory, he became a trader and interpreter in the area surrounding Fort Benton. Observing the detrimental impact of alcohol on the Métis, he engaged in an unsuccessful attempt to curtail the whisky trade.

In Pointe-au-Loup, Fort Berthold, Dakota Territory in 1881, he married the young Métis Marguerite Monet &quot;dite&quot; Bellehumeur, according to the custom of the country (à la façon du pays), on 28 April, the marriage being solemnized on 9 March 1882. Evelina learned of this marriage from a newspaper and wrote a letter accusing Riel of &quot;infamy&quot;. Marguerite and Louis were to have three children: Jean-Louis (1882–1908); Marie-Angélique (1883–1897); and a boy who was born and died on 21 October 1885, less than one month before Riel was hanged.

Riel soon became involved in the politics of Montana, and in 1882, actively campaigned on behalf of the Republican Party. He brought a suit against a Democrat for rigging a vote, but was then himself accused of fraudulently inducing British subjects to take part in the election. In response, Riel applied for United States citizenship and was naturalized on 16 March 1883. With two young children, he had by 1884 settled down and was teaching school at the St. Peter&#x27;s Jesuit mission in the Sun River district of Montana.

==North-West Rebellion==
Following the Red River Resistance, Métis travelled west and settled in the Saskatchewan Valley. But by the 1880s, the rapid collapse of the buffalo herd was causing near starvation among the First Nations. This was exacerbated by a reduction in government assistance, and by a general failure of Ottawa to live up to its treaty obligations. The Métis were likewise obliged to give up the hunt and take up agriculture—but this transition was accompanied by complex issues surrounding land claims similar to those that had previously arisen in Manitoba. Moreover, settlers from Europe and the eastern provinces were also moving into the Saskatchewan territories, and they too had complaints related to the administration of the territories. Virtually all parties therefore had grievances, and by 1884 Anglophone settlers, Anglo-Métis and Métis communities were holding meetings and petitioning a largely unresponsive government for redress.

In the electoral district of Lorne, a meeting of the south branch Métis was held in the village of Batoche on 24 March, and representatives voted to ask Riel to return and represent their cause. On 6 May a joint &quot;Settler&#x27;s Union&quot; meeting was attended by both the Métis and English-speaking representatives from Prince Albert, including William Henry Jackson, an Ontario settler sympathetic to the Métis and known to them as Honoré Jackson, and James Isbister of the Anglo-Métis. It was here resolved to send a delegation to ask Riel to return.

===Return of Riel===
The head of the delegation to Riel was Gabriel Dumont, a respected buffalo hunter and leader of the Saint-Laurent Métis who had known Riel in Manitoba. James Isbister was the lone Anglo-Métis delegate. Riel was easily swayed to support their cause. Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba.

Upon his arrival Métis and Anglophone settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach. During June 1884, the Plains Cree leaders Big Bear and Poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints, and subsequently held meetings with Riel. However, the Native grievances were quite different from those of the settlers, and nothing was resolved.

Honoré Jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition to be sent to Ottawa. In the interim, Riel&#x27;s support began to waver. As Riel&#x27;s religious pronouncements became increasingly heretical, the clergy distanced themselves, and father Alexis André cautioned Riel against mixing religion and politics. In response to bribes by territorial lieutenant-governor and Indian commissioner Edgar Dewdney, local English-language newspapers adopted an editorial stance critical of Riel.

Nevertheless, Riel&#x27;s campaign for better treatment continued, and on 16 December Riel forwarded the committee&#x27;s petition to the government, along with the suggestion that delegates be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiation. Receipt of the petition was acknowledged by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Macdonald&#x27;s Secretary of State, although Macdonald himself would later deny having ever seen it. By then many original followers had left; only 250 remained at Batoche when it fell in May 1885.

While Riel awaited response from Ottawa he considered returning to Montana, but had by February resolved to stay. Without a productive course of action, Riel began to engage in obsessive prayer, and was experiencing a significant relapse of his mental agitations. He publicly espoused an increasingly heretical doctrine, causing a deterioration in his relationship with the Catholic clergy.

On 11 February 1885, the Métis received a response to their petition. The government proposed to take a census of the North-West Territories, and to form a commission to investigate grievances. This angered a faction of the Métis who saw it as a mere delaying tactic; they favoured taking up arms at once. Riel became the leader of this faction, but he lost the support of almost all Anglophones and Anglo-Métis, and the Catholic Church. He also lost the support of the Métis faction supporting local leader Charles Nolin. But Riel, undoubtedly influenced by his messianic delusions, became increasingly supportive of this course of action. Disenchanted with the status quo, and swayed by Riel&#x27;s charisma and eloquent rhetoric, hundreds of Métis remained loyal to Riel, despite his proclamations that Bishop Ignace Bourget should be accepted as pope, and that &quot;Rome has fallen&quot;.

===Open rebellion===
The Provisional Government of Saskatchewan was declared at Batoche on 19 March. Riel was the political and spiritual leader and Dumont assumed responsibility for military affairs. Riel formed a council called the Exovedate (a neologism meaning &quot;those who picked from the flock&quot;). On 21 March, Riel&#x27;s emissaries demanded that Crozier surrender Fort Carlton. Scouting near Duck Lake on 26 March, a force led by Gabriel Dumont unexpectedly chanced upon a party from Fort Carlton. In the ensuing Battle of Duck Lake, the police were routed and the North-West Rebellion was begun in earnest.

The near-completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway allowed troops from eastern Canada to quickly arrive in the territory. Knowing that he could not defeat the Canadians in direct confrontation, Dumont had hoped to force the Canadians to negotiate by engaging in a sustained campaign of guerrilla warfare; Dumont realized a modest success along these lines at the Battle of Fish Creek on 24 April 1885. 

Riel, however, insisted on concentrating forces at Batoche to defend his &quot;city of God&quot;. The outcome of the ensuing Battle of Batoche which took place from 9 to 12 May was never in doubt, and on 15 May a disheveled Riel surrendered to Canadian forces. Although Big Bear&#x27;s forces managed to hold out until the Battle of Loon Lake on 3 June, the Rebellion was a dismal failure for Indigenous communities.
==Trial==

Several individuals closely tied to the government requested that the trial be held in Winnipeg in July 1885. Some historians contend that the trial was moved to Regina because of concerns with the possibility of an ethnically mixed and sympathetic jury. Prime Minister Macdonald ordered the trial to be convened in Regina, where Riel was tried before a jury of six Anglophone Protestants. The trial began on 20 July 1885.

Riel delivered two long speeches during his trial, defending his own actions and affirming the rights of the Métis people. He rejected his lawyers&#x27; attempt to argue that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found him guilty but recommended mercy; nonetheless, Judge Hugh Richardson sentenced him to death on 1 August 1885, with the date of his execution initially set for 18 September 1885. &quot;We tried Riel for treason,&quot; one juror later said, &quot;And he was hanged for the murder of Scott.&quot; Lewis Thomas notes that &quot;the government&#x27;s conduct of the case was to be a travesty of justice&quot;.

==Execution==
Boulton writes in his memoirs that, as the date of his execution approached, Riel regretted his opposition to the defence of insanity and vainly attempted to provide evidence that he was not sane. Requests for a retrial, petitions for a commuted sentence, and an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain were denied. John A. Macdonald, who was instrumental in upholding Riel&#x27;s sentence, is famously quoted as saying &quot;He shall hang though every dog in Quebec bark in his favour&quot; (although the veracity of this quote is uncertain).

Before his execution, Riel received Father André as his spiritual advisor. He was also given writing materials and allowed to correspond with friends and relatives. Louis Riel was hanged for treason on 16 November 1885 at the North-West Mounted Police barracks in Regina.
Boulton writes of Riel&#x27;s final moments:

 Père André, after explaining to Riel that the end was at hand, asked him if he was at peace with men. Riel answered &quot;Yes.&quot; The next question was, &quot;Do you forgive all your enemies?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Riel then asked him if he might speak. Father André advised him not to do so. He then received the kiss of peace from both the priests, and Father André exclaimed in French, &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;So, go to heaven!&quot;

 ... [Riel&#x27;s] last words were to say good-bye to Dr. Jukes and thank him for his kindness, and just before the white cap was pulled over his face he said, &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;Thank Mrs. Forget&quot;.

The cap was pulled down, and while he was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not instantaneous. Louis Riel&#x27;s pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the rope around his neck slowly strangled and choked him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows&#x27; enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was accordingly done that night.

Following the execution, Riel&#x27;s body was returned to his mother&#x27;s home in St. Vital, where it lay in state. On 12 December 1886, his remains were interred in the churchyard of the Saint-Boniface Cathedral following the celebration of a requiem mass.

The trial and execution of Riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The execution was both supported and opposed by the provinces. For example, conservative Ontario strongly supported Riel&#x27;s execution, but Quebec was vehemently opposed to it. Francophones were upset Riel was hanged because they thought his execution was a symbol of Anglophone dominance of Canada. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the execution as the punishment for Riel&#x27;s treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. In Quebec, the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.

==Historiography==

Historians have debated the Riel case so often and so passionately that he is the most written-about person in Canadian history. Interpretations have varied dramatically over time. The first amateur English language histories hailed the triumph of civilization, represented by English-speaking Protestants, over savagery represented by the half-breed Métis who were Catholic and spoke French. Riel was portrayed as an insane traitor and an obstacle to the expansion of Canada to the West.

By the mid-20th century academic historians had dropped the theme of savagery versus civilization, deemphasized the Métis, and focused on Riel, presenting his execution as a major cause of the bitter division in Canada along ethnocultural and geographical lines of religion and language. W. L. Morton says of the execution that it &quot;convulsed the course of national politics for the next decade&quot;: it was well received in Ontario, particularly among Orangemen, but francophone Quebec defended Riel as &quot;the symbol, indeed as a hero of his race&quot;. Morton concluded that some of Riel&#x27;s positions were defensible, but that &quot;they did not present a program of practical substance which the government might have granted without betrayal of its responsibilities&quot;. J. M. Bumsted in 2000 said that for Manitoba historian James Jackson, the shooting of Scott—&quot;perhaps the result of Riel&#x27;s incipient madness—was the great blemish on Riel&#x27;s achievement, depriving him of his proper role as the father of Manitoba.&quot;
The Catholic clergy had originally supported the Métis, but reversed themselves when they realized that Riel was leading a heretical movement. They made sure that he was not honored as a martyr. However the clergy lost their influence during the Quiet Revolution, and activists in Quebec found in Riel the perfect hero, with the image now of a freedom fighter who stood up for his people against an oppressive government in the face of widespread racist bigotry. He was made a folk hero by Métis, French Canadian and other Canadian minorities. Activists who espoused violence embraced his image; in the 1960s, the Quebec terrorist group, the Front de libération du Québec adopted the name &quot;Louis Riel&quot; for one of its terrorist cells.

Across Canada there emerged a new interpretation of reality in his rebellion, holding that the Métis had major unresolved grievances; that the government was indeed unresponsive; that Riel had chosen violence only as a last resort; and he was given a questionable trial, then executed by a vengeful government. John Foster said in 1985 that &quot;the interpretive drift of the last half-century ... has witnessed increasingly shrill though frequently uncritical condemnations of Canadian government culpability and equally uncritical identification with the &quot;victimization&quot; of the &quot;innocent&quot; Métis&quot;. However, political scientist Thomas Flanagan reversed his views after editing Riel&#x27;s writings: he argued that &quot;the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making&quot;, that Riel&#x27;s violent approach was unnecessary given the government&#x27;s response to his initial &quot;constitutional agitation&quot;, and &quot;that he received a surprisingly fair trial&quot;.

An article by Doug Owram appearing in the &quot;Canadian Historical Review&quot; in 1982 found that Riel had become &quot;a Canadian folk hero&quot;, even &quot;mythical&quot;, in English Canada, corresponding with the designation of Batoche as a national historic site and the compilation of his writings. That compilation consisted of three volumes of letters, diaries, and other prose writings; a fourth volume of his poetry; and a fifth volume which contained reference materials. Edited by George Stanley, Raymond Huel, Gilles Martel, Thomas Flanagan and Glen Campbell, this work &quot;ma[de] it possible to think comprehensively about Riel&#x27;s life and his achievements&quot;, but was also criticized for some of its editorial decisions. In a 2010 speech, Beverley McLachlin, then Chief Justice of Canada, summed up Riel as being a rebel by the standards of the time but a patriot &quot;viewed through our modern lens&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Saskatchewan Métis&#x27; requested land grants were all provided by the government by the end of 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. However, much of the land was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel&#x27;s worst fears were realized—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalization in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live in shantytowns on undesirable land. Saskatchewan did not become a province until 1905.

Riel&#x27;s execution and Macdonald&#x27;s refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec. Honoré Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics (particularly in Quebec) by the Liberal party in the 20th century.

Since the 1980s, numerous federal politicians have introduced private member&#x27;s bills seeking to pardon Riel or recognize him as a Father of Confederation. In 1992, the House of Commons passed a resolution recognizing &quot;the unique and historic role of Louis Riel as a founder of Manitoba and his contribution in the development of Confederation&quot;. The CBC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Canadian&quot; project ranked Riel as the 11th &quot;Greatest Canadian&quot; on the basis of a public vote.

On 19 February 2024, Riel was formally recognized as Manitoba&#x27;s first premier by virtue of &quot;The Louis Riel Act&quot;.

===Commemorations===

In 2007, Manitoba&#x27;s provincial government voted to recognize Louis Riel Day as a provincial holiday, observed on the third Monday of February.

Two statues of Riel are located in Winnipeg. One of these statues, the work of architect Étienne Gaboury and sculptor Marcien Lemay, depicts Riel as a naked and tortured figure. It was unveiled in 1971 and stood in the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the Université de Saint-Boniface. It was replaced with a statue of Louis Riel designed by Miguel Joyal depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 12 May 1996, in Winnipeg. A statue of Riel on the grounds of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in Regina was installed and later removed for similar reasons.

In numerous communities across Canada, Riel is commemorated in the names of streets, schools, neighbourhoods, and other buildings. Examples in Winnipeg include the landmark Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge linking old Saint-Boniface with Downtown Winnipeg, and the Louis Riel School Division. The student centre at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon is named after Riel, as is the Louis Riel Trail. There are schools named after Louis Riel in four major Canadian cities: Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa and Winnipeg.

Portrayals of Riel&#x27;s role in the Red River Resistance include the 1979 CBC television film &quot;Riel&quot; and Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown&#x27;s acclaimed 2003 graphic novel &quot;Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography&quot;. An opera about Riel entitled &quot;Louis Riel&quot; was commissioned for Canada&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 1967; it was written by Harry Somers, with an English and French libretto by Mavor Moore and Jacques Languirand.

<text>Listerine () is a brand of antiseptic mouthwash that is promoted with the slogan &quot;Kills germs that cause bad breath&quot;. Named after Joseph Lister, who pioneered antiseptic surgery at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary in United Kingdom, Listerine was developed in 1879 by Joseph Lawrence, a chemist in St. Louis, United States.

Originally marketed by the Lambert Pharmacal Company (which later became Warner–Lambert), Listerine has been manufactured and distributed by Johnson &amp; Johnson since that company&#x27;s acquisition of Pfizer&#x27;s consumer healthcare division on December 20, 2006.

The Listerine brand name is also used in toothpaste, chewable tablets, and self-dissolving teeth-whitening strips.

== History ==

Inspired by Louis Pasteur&#x27;s ideas on microbial infection, the English doctor Joseph Lister demonstrated in 1865 that use of carbolic acid on surgical dressings would significantly reduce rates of post-surgical infection. Lister&#x27;s work in turn inspired St. Louis-based doctor Joseph Lawrence to develop an alcohol-based formula for a surgical antiseptic which included eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol (its exact composition was a trade secret). Lawrence named his antiseptic &quot;Listerine&quot; in honor of Lister.

Lawrence hoped to promote Listerine&#x27;s use as a general germicide as well as a surgical antiseptic, and licensed his formula to a local pharmacist named Jordan Wheat Lambert in 1881. Lambert subsequently started the Lambert Pharmacal Company, marketing Listerine. Listerine was promoted to dentists for oral care in 1895 and was the first over-the-counter mouthwash sold in the United States, in 1914.

Lambert&#x27;s licensing agreement with Lawrence required that he and his &quot;heirs, executors and assigns&quot; be paid royalties by Lambert or its successors for each bottle sold in perpetuity, until such time that Lambert or its successors ceases manufacturing Listerine. Most of these royalty shares are held by Lawrence&#x27;s heirs. Real estate broker John Reynolds bought a roughly 50% stake in the royalties in the 1950s, which he then transferred to the Archdiocese of New York, and was later resold to other parties to help fund the diocese. The Salvation Army, American Bible Society, and Wellesley College also held shares in Listerine royalties.

Listerine entered common household use after Jordan Wheat Lambert&#x27;s son Gerard Lambert joined the company and promoted an aggressive marketing campaign. According to Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner&#x27;s book &quot;Freakonomics&quot;:
In 1955, Lambert Pharmacal merged with New York-based Warner-Hudnut and became Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company, and incorporated in Delaware with its corporate headquarters in Morris Plains, New Jersey. Following the merger, Warner-Lambert attempted to back out of the aforementioned royalty agreements with Lawrence by filing a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The company cited that the payments were based upon Listerine&#x27;s formula having initially been a trade secret, but that since the formula had been published in 1931, the property no longer had a value, and that the indefinite agreement was legally unreasonable. The court, however, ruled in favor of Lawrence and the defendants, citing that the conditions were plainly-worded, implicit, and could be waived by ending production of the product.

In 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert. Among Lambert&#x27;s assets was the original land for Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.From 1921 until the mid-1970s, Listerine was also marketed as preventive and remedy for colds and sore throats. In 1976, the Federal Trade Commission ruled that these claims were misleading, and that Listerine had &quot;no efficacy&quot; at either preventing or alleviating the symptoms of sore throats and colds. Warner-Lambert was ordered to stop making the claims, and to include in the next $10.2 million worth of Listerine ads specific mention that &quot;Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity.&quot; The advertisement run by Listerine added the preamble &quot;contrary to prior advertising&quot;.

For a short time, beginning in 1927, the Lambert Pharmaceutical Company marketed Listerine Cigarettes.

From the 1930s into the 1950s, advertisements claimed that applying Listerine to the scalp could prevent &quot;infectious dandruff&quot;.

Listerine was packaged in a glass bottle inside a corrugated cardboard tube for nearly 80 years before the first revamps were made to the brand: in 1992, Cool Mint Listerine was introduced in addition to the original Listerine Antiseptic formula and, in 1994, both brands were introduced in plastic bottles for the first time. In 1995, FreshBurst was added, then in 2003 Natural Citrus. In 2006 a new addition to the &quot;less intense&quot; variety, Vanilla Mint, was released. Nine different kinds of Listerine are on the market in the U.S. and elsewhere: Original, Cool Mint, FreshBurst, Natural Citrus, Naturals, Soft Mint (Vanilla Mint), UltraClean (formerly Advanced Listerine), Tooth Defense (mint shield), and Whitening pre-brush rinse (clean mint). In the United Kingdom, where in recent years the only option for most residents to obtain the original Listerine was to purchase from a dwindling number of larger branches of Boots the Chemist only the flavoured products are now obtainable as Boots has removed the Original from its selection. Original is not listed on the Listerine UK website as among the Listerine products available in the United Kingdom.

==Composition==
According to the product overview, the ingredients are as following for Listerine Total Care. Similar distribution is contained in other varieties, which also list the essential oils as active ingredients.

=== Listerine Total Care ===

==== Active ingredient ====
* Sodium fluoride 0.02% (0.01% w/v fluoride ion)

==== Inactive ingredients ====
* Water
* Sorbitol
* Alcohol (21.6% v/v)
* Poloxamer 407
* Sodium Saccharin
* Flavor
* Eucalyptol
* Methyl Salicylate
* Thymol
* Phosphoric Acid
* Menthol
* Disodium Phosphate
* Sucralose
* Red 40
* Blue 1

Distributions in case of Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash, Original-05/22/2008 for essential oils are: menthol (mint) 0.042%, thymol (thyme) 0.064%, methyl salicylate (wintergreen) 0.06%, and eucalyptol (eucalyptus) 0.092%.

== Benefits ==
In combination, all have an antiseptic effect, and there is some thought that methyl salicylate may have an anti inflammatory effect as well. Ethanol, which is toxic to bacteria at concentrations of 40%, is present in concentrations of 21.6% in the flavored product and 26.9% in the original gold Listerine Antiseptic. At this concentration, the ethanol serves to dissolve the active ingredients.

Research indicates that Listerine can reduce dental plaque by 22.2% and gingivitis by 28.2% at 6 months. Dental plaque by 20.8% and gingivitis by 27.7% at 6 months, when compared with vehicle in test. Vehicle was 26.9% hydroalcoholic containing all ingredients in Listerine Antiseptic except its essential oils.

Listerine also sell a formulation called Listerine Advanced Defence Gum Treatment containing a common food preservative, ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE) at 0.147%.

==Safety==

=== Alcohol ===
The addition of essential oils means the ethanol is considered to be undrinkable, known as denatured alcohol, and it is therefore not regulated as an alcoholic beverage in the United States. (Specially Denatured Alcohol Formula 38-B, specified in Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 21, Subpart D) However, consumption of mouthwash to obtain intoxication does occur, especially among alcoholics and underage drinkers.

The use of alcohol-containing mouthwash such as Listerine may increase the risk of developing oral cancer in some cases, see . In 2009, Johnson and Johnson launched a new alcohol-free version of the product called Listerine Zero.

=== Contaminants ===
On April 11, 2007, McNeil-PPC disclosed that there were potentially contaminants in all Listerine Agent Cool Blue products sold since its launch in 2006, and that all bottles were being recalled. The recall affected some 4,000,000 bottles sold since that time. According to the company, Listerine Agent Cool Blue is the only product affected by the contamination and no other products in the Listerine family were under recall.

<doc id="18666" wikidata="Q1030283" url="?curid=18666" title="Ludo">
<text>Ludo (; ) is a strategy-based board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die. Like other cross and circle games, Ludo originated from the Indian game Pachisi. The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.

== History ==

Pachisi was created in India in the sixth century CE. It was modified to use a cubic die with a die cup and patented as &quot;Ludo&quot; in England in 1896.The origin of Ludo is from Hindu Mythology, the Mahabharata Tale, which Ludo was known as Pachisi or “Pasha.” The Mahabharata tale tells a story of a war between two families, the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Although there is no true answer the Ludo was found on historic Ellora Caves in Maharashtra linking mythology to this game. Some say that Alfred Colier invented Ludo but there is evidence that proves that Ludo was from the royal court of Akbar. Colier tried to own the right to Ludo in 1891, renaming his ludo as “Royal Ludo.” Colier was granted that right on the Ludo and gave others duplicates of his version of the game. The Royal Navy took Ludo and converted it into the board game Uckers.

== Ludo board ==
Special areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is assigned a colour and has four tokens in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped , with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player&#x27;s home column. A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player&#x27;s starting square. At the centre of the board is a large finishing square, often composed of coloured triangles atop the players&#x27; home columns (thus depicting &quot;arrows&quot; pointing to the finish).

== Rules ==

=== Overview ===

Two, three, or four can play, without partnerships. At the beginning of the game, each player&#x27;s four tokens are out of play and in the player&#x27;s yard (one of the large corner areas of the board in the player&#x27;s colour). When able to, the players enter their tokens one per turn on their respective starting squares and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the game track (the path of squares not part of any player&#x27;s home column). When reaching the square below their home column, a player continues by moving tokens up the column to the finishing square. The rolls of a single die control the swiftness of the tokens, and entry to the finishing square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue to play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.

===Gameplay===
Each player rolls a die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a six. Players can draw a token from home every time they get a six unless home is empty or move a piece six times. The start box has two own tokens (is doubled). If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a six, the turn passes to the next player.

Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. Once players have one or more tokens in play, they select a token and move it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the die. If a token advances onto a spot occupied by opponent&#x27;s token then the opposing token is returned to its respective home point. This forces the opponent to roll another 6 to take it out of their home and move it again. If a token advances onto a spot occupied by a token of the same colour, then they create something that is called a &quot;block&quot;. If an opposing token lands on the same spot as the block, the advancing token is returned to its respective home point.

If the player cannot draw a token from home, rolling a six earns the player an additional or &quot;bonus&quot; roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a six again, the player earns again an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a six, the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.

A player&#x27;s home column squares are always safe, since no opponent may enter them. In the home column, a player cannot jump over; after one rotation is completed, the player must enter the home and roll the exact number needed to get each token onto the home triangle.

====Chinese====
* Aeroplane chess: A Chinese cross-and-circle board game derived from Ludo, it uses aeroplanes as tokens, with additional features such as coloured cells, jumps, and shortcuts.

====Canadian====
* Tock: Players race their four tokens (or marbles) around the game board from start to finish, with the objective being to be the first to take all of one&#x27;s tokens &quot;home&quot;. Like Sorry!, it is played with playing cards rather than dice.

====Latvian====
The Latvian version of the game is called &quot;Riču-Raču&quot;. The board is larger than the original board with seven home spaces instead of four (but the player must always reach the four farthest home spaces anyway, if the player overrolls, then they must move the extra spaces back and wait for their next turn). Captures are allowed and two tokens cannot occupy the same space. If a player rolls a one or a six, they can either get a second roll or move a token to the starting position.

===Differences===

* Ludo played in the Indian subcontinent features a safe square in each quadrant, normally the fourth square from the top in the rightmost column. These squares are usually marked with a star. In India Ludo is often played with two dice, and rolling &quot;1&quot; on a die also allows a token to enter active play. Thus if a player rolls a &quot;1&quot; and a &quot;6&quot;, they may get a token out and move it six steps.
*In Pakistan, a variation that uses two dice allows backwards movement. The dice are rolled and the die values can be used independently or in combination to move two pieces or a single piece forwards or backwards or both. (E.g., if the roll gives &quot;1&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, the player can move a single piece 4 steps forwards and then 1 step backwards, or 1 step forwards and 4 steps backwards, or 1 then 4 steps forwards or backwards. Or the player can move a piece 1 step forwards or backwards, and another piece 4 steps forwards or backwards.)
* To get a game started faster, some house rules allow a player with no pieces on the board to bring their first piece into play on any roll, on a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;6&quot;, or allow multiple tries to roll a &quot;6&quot; (with three rolls being the most popular).
* If a piece lands on the same space as another piece of the same colour, the moved piece must take the preceding space.
* Some variations permit doubled blocks to be passed by rolling a &quot;6&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.
* A block of two or more pieces cannot be taken by an opponent&#x27;s single piece.
* Doubled pieces may move half the number if an even number is thrown (e.g. move two spaces if a &quot;4&quot; is thrown).
* A doubled piece may capture another doubled piece (like in Coppit). Three pieces together are weak and can be cut by a single piece.
* A board may have only four spaces in each home column. All four of a player&#x27;s pieces must finish in these spaces for the player to have finished the game. (See .)
* A player must move all the numbers rolled (e.g. if a player rolls multiple &quot;6s&quot;, they have to use all the numbers to move).
* A player cannot capture or enter finish if they have numbers remaining. (E.g., if a player rolls a &quot;6&quot; and a &quot;2&quot; and they have the option to capture or enter finish with one of their pieces using the &quot;2&quot;, they can only do so if they have another piece that can use the &quot;6&quot;.)
* To speed the game up, extra turns or bonus moves can be awarded for capturing a piece or getting a piece home; these may grant passage past a block.
* In Denmark and some other countries the board has eight spaces marked with a globe and eight with a star. The globes are safe spaces where a piece cannot be captured. The exception is that a player who has not yet entered all pieces, can always enter a piece on a roll of &quot;6&quot;. If the entry space is occupied by another player&#x27;s piece, that piece is captured. Otherwise the entry spaces work like the other globe spaces. A piece which would have landed on a star instead moves to the next star.
* In Vietnam, it is called &quot;Cờ cá ngựa&quot;, where the game is modeled after a horse race with the tokens modeled as horse heads. In this variation, a &quot;1&quot; is given equal status to a &quot;6&quot; (meaning that the player can enter a token into play and can roll again). Furthermore, once a player&#x27;s token reaches their home column, it can only go up each square with an exact roll. This means that a person outside the column must roll a &quot;1&quot; to enter the first square, a &quot;2&quot; afterwards to enter the second, and so forth.

====African====
In some parts of Africa including Nigeria, Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho and South Africa, the following rules are reportedly played:
* A doubled block also blocks trailing pieces of the player who created the block, or blocks them unless they roll the exact number to land on the block; additionally, the doubled block cannot move forwards until the block that landed upon it moves off again. This reduces the tactical advantage of a block and makes the game more interesting.
* If the two players sitting opposite are partners, the players can exchange numbers.
* There are four safety squares on the board, like castle squares in Pachisi, as well as the safe home squares, where a piece may able to move forwards or backwards and start their turn before previous player finishes.
* A piece landing on a square with an opponent&#x27;s piece not only sends the opponent piece back to the starting area but also sends the landing piece to its home square.
* A player cannot move their first piece into the home column unless they have captured at least one piece of any of the opponents.
* If a player captures the piece of another player, they are awarded a bonus roll. If in the bonus roll, another player&#x27;s piece is captured, another bonus roll is awarded and so on.

<text>Human life expectancy is a statistical measure of the estimate of the average remaining years of life at a given age. The most commonly used measure is &quot;life expectancy at birth&quot; (LEB, or in demographic notation &quot;e&quot;0, where &quot;e&quot;x denotes the average life remaining at age &quot;x&quot;). This can be defined in two ways. &quot;Cohort&quot; LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. &quot;Period&quot; LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year. National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of &quot;period&quot; LEB.

Human remains from the early Bronze Age indicate an LEB of 24. In 2019, world LEB was 73.3. A combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 would have relatively few people dying at exactly 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity, LEB can be grossly misinterpreted, leading to the belief that a population with a low LEB would have a small proportion of older people. A different measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood. For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but not a 60-year one).

Aggregate population measures—such as the proportion of the population in various age groups—are also used alongside individual-based measures—such as formal life expectancy—when analyzing population structure and dynamics. Pre-modern societies had universally higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies at every age for both males and females.

Life expectancy, longevity, and maximum lifespan are not synonymous. Longevity refers to the relatively long lifespan of some members of a population. Maximum lifespan is the age at death for the longest-lived individual of a species. Mathematically, life expectancy is denoted formula_1 and is the mean number of years of life remaining at a given age formula_2, with a particular . Because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may die many years before or after the expected survival.

Life expectancy is also used in plant or animal ecology, and in life tables (also known as actuarial tables). The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects, though the related term shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms &quot;mean time to breakdown&quot; and &quot;mean time between failures&quot; are used in engineering.

== History ==

The earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt, Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.

==Human patterns==
===Maximum===
The longest verified lifespan for any human is that of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who is verified as having lived to age 122 years, 164 days, between 21 February 1875 and 4 August 1997. This is referred to as the &quot;maximum life span&quot;, which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived. According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for limit on human lifespan. However, this view has been questioned on the basis of error patterns. A theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.

===Variation over time===

The following information is derived from the 1961 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.

Life expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality and child mortality but not prenatal mortality.

English life expectancy at birth averaged about 36 years in the 17th and 18th centuries, one of the highest levels in the world although infant and child mortality remained higher than in later periods. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia, and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40% died before reaching adulthood. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. Recorded deaths among children under the age of 5 years fell in London from 74.5% of the recorded births in 1730–49 to 31.8% in 1810–29, though this overstates mortality and its fall because of net immigration (hence more dying in the metropolis than were born there) and incomplete registration (particularly of births, and especially in the earlier period). English life expectancy at birth reached 41 years in the 1840s, 43 in the 1870s and 46 in the 1890s, though infant mortality remained at around 150 per thousand throughout this period.

Public health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic, the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.

===Regional variations===
There are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet.

Human beings are expected to live on average 60 years in Eswatini and 82.6 years in Japan. An analysis published in 2011 in &quot;The Lancet&quot; attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities, excellent public health, and a healthy diet.

The World Health Organization announced that the COVID-19 pandemic reversed the trend of steady gain in life expectancy at birth. The pandemic wiped out nearly a decade of progress in improving life expectancy.

==== Africa ====
During the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. This is most apparent by the impact of AIDS on many African countries. According to projections made by the United Nations in 2002, the life expectancy at birth for 2010–2015 (if HIV/AIDS did not exist) would have been:
* 70.7 years instead of 31.6 years, Botswana
* 69.9 years instead of 41.5 years, South Africa
* 70.5 years instead of 31.8 years, Zimbabwe

==== Eastern Europe ====
On average, eastern Europeans tend to live shorter lives than their western counterparts. For example, Spaniards from Madrid can expect to live to 85, but Bulgarians from the region of Severozapaden are predicted to live just past their 73rd birthday. This is in large part due to poor health habits, such as heavy smoking and high alcoholism in the region, and environmental factors, such as high air pollution.
==== United States ====
In 2022, the life expectancy was 77.5 in the United States, a decline from 2014, but an increase from 2021. In what has been described as a &quot;life expectancy crisis&quot;, there were a total of 13 million &quot;missing Americans&quot; from 1980 to 2021, deaths that would have been averted if it had the standard mortality rate of &quot;wealthy nations&quot;.

The annual number of &quot;missing Americans&quot; has been increasing, with 622,534 in 2019 alone. Most excess deaths in the United States can largely be attributed to increasing obesity, alcoholism, drug overdoses, car accidents, suicides, and murders, with poor sleep, unhealthy diets, and loneliness being linked to most of them.

Black Americans have generally shorter life expectancies than their White American counterparts. For example, white Americans in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest, the greatest difference being 7.1 years in 1993. In contrast, Asian American women live the longest of all ethnic and gender groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years. The life expectancy of Hispanic Americans is 81.2 years.

==== Japan ====
In 2023, the life expectancy was 84.5 in Japan, 4.2 years above the OECD average, and one of the highest in the world. Japan&#x27;s high life expectancy can largely be explained by their healthy diets, which are low on salt, fat, and red meat. For these reasons, Japan has a low obesity rate, and ultimately low mortality from heart disease and cancers.

==== In cities ====
Cities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In American cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.

===Economic circumstances===
Economic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas. In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only away.

A 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy. However, in contrast, a study by José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually &quot;increased&quot; during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general. The authors suggest that when people are working at a more extreme degree during prosperous economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and the likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.

Life expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average. Other factors affecting an individual&#x27;s life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet, and exercise.

===Sex differences===

In the present, female human life expectancy is greater than that of males, despite females having higher morbidity rates (see health survival paradox). There are many potential reasons for this. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol, and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war, or car wrecks) or intentional (suicide). Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease. These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer. In the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age.

A paper from 2015 found that female foetuses have a higher mortality rate than male foetuses. This finding contradicts papers dating from 2002 and earlier that attribute the male sex to higher in-utero mortality rates. Among the smallest premature babies (those under ), females have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005. Data from the United Kingdom shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.

Some argue that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger-sized individuals within a species tend, on average, to have shorter lives. This biological difference occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.

In her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. However, Kalben&#x27;s study was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where the demographic transition occurred relatively early. United Nations statistics from mid-twentieth century onward, show that in all parts of the world, females have a higher life expectancy at age 60 than males. Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. Except for birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.

One recent suggestion is that mitochondrial mutations which shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore, such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.

Another explanation is the unguarded X hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, one reason for why the average lifespan of males is not as long as that of females––by 18% on average, according to the study––is that they have a Y chromosome which cannot protect an individual from harmful genes expressed on the X chromosome, while a duplicate X chromosome, as present in female organisms, can ensure harmful genes are not expressed.

In developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880, death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline. Most of the difference in life expectancy between the sexes is accounted for by differences in the rate of death by cardiovascular diseases among persons aged 50–70.

===Genetics===

The heritability of lifespan is estimated to be less than 10%, meaning the majority of variation in lifespan is attributable due to differences in environment rather than genetic variation. However, researchers have identified regions of the genome which can influence the length of life and the number of years lived in good health. For example, a genome-wide association study of 1 million lifespans found 12 genetic loci which influenced lifespan by modifying susceptibility to cardiovascular and smoking-related disease. The locus with the largest effect is APOE. Carriers of the APOE ε4 allele live approximately one year less than average (per copy of the ε4 allele), mainly due to increased risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In July 2020, scientists identified 10 genomic loci with consistent effects across multiple lifespan-related traits, including healthspan, lifespan, and longevity. The genes affected by variation in these loci highlighted haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. This study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans.

A follow-up study which investigated the genetics of frailty and self-rated health in addition to healthspan, lifespan, and longevity also highlighted haem metabolism as an important pathway, and found genetic variants which lower blood protein levels of LPA and VCAM1 were associated with increased healthy lifespan.

===Centenarians===

In developed countries, the number of centenarians is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which means doubling the centenarian population every 13 years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2050. Japan is the country with the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1 million inhabitants in September 2010). Shimane Prefecture had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants.

In the United States, the number of centenarians grew from 32,194 in 1980 to 71,944 in November 2010 (232 centenarians per million inhabitants).

===Mental illness===
Mental illness is reported to occur in approximately 18% of the average American population.

The mentally ill have been shown to have a 10- to 25-year reduction in life expectancy. Generally, the reduction of lifespan in the mentally ill population compared to the mentally stable population has been studied and documented.

The greater mortality of people with mental disorders may be due to death from injury, from co-morbid conditions, or medication side effects. For instance, psychiatric medications can increase the risk of developing diabetes. It has been shown that the psychiatric medication olanzapine can increase risk of developing agranulocytosis, among other comorbidities. Psychiatric medicines also affect the gastrointestinal tract; the mentally ill have a four times risk of gastrointestinal disease.

As of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found an increased risk of death in the mentally ill.

===Other illnesses===
The life expectancy of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly 10–20 years. People over 60 years old with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have about a 50% life expectancy of 3–10 years. Other demographics that tend to have a lower life expectancy than average include transplant recipients and the obese.

=== Education ===
Education on all levels has been shown to be strongly associated with increased life expectancy. This association may be due partly to higher income, which can lead to increased life expectancy. Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.

According to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education. In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.

Preschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.

==Evolution and aging rate==
Various species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms which—by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle—live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, there will be less natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span. That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad; however, the opposite relationship was found in an equally prominent study of guppies by Reznick.

One prominent and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction. Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span from a very limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That is the key to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.

The ability of skin fibroblasts to perform DNA repair after UV irradiation was measured in shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human. It was found that DNA repair capability increased systematically with species life span. Since this original study in 1974, at least 14 additional studies were performed on mammals to test this correlation. In all, but two of these studies, lifespan correlated with DNA repair levels, suggesting that DNA repair capability contributes to life expectancy. See DNA damage theory of aging.

In a broad survey of zoo animals, no relationship was found between investment of the animal in reproduction and its life span.

==Calculation==

In actuarial notation, the probability of surviving from age formula_2 to age formula_4 is denoted formula_5 and the probability of dying during age formula_2 (i.e. between ages formula_2 and formula_8) is denoted formula_9 . For example, if 10% of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday, the age-specific death probability at 90 would be 10%. This probability describes the &quot;likelihood&quot; of dying at that age, and is not the &quot;rate&quot; at which people of that age die. It can be shown that
The &quot;curtate future lifetime&quot;, denoted formula_10, is a discrete random variable representing the remaining lifetime at age formula_2, rounded down to whole years. Life expectancy, more technically called the &quot;curtate expected lifetime&quot; and denoted &quot;formula_12 ,&quot; is the mean of formula_10—that is to say, the expected number of whole years of life remaining, assuming survival to age formula_2. So,

Substituting () into the sum and simplifying gives the final result

If the assumption is made that, on average, people live a half year on the year of their death, the complete life expectancy at age formula_2 would be formula_16, which is denoted by e̊x, and is the intuitive definition of life expectancy.

By definition, life expectancy is an arithmetic mean. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called &#x27;omega&#x27;). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.

The starting point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members. If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years &quot;exposed to risk&quot; in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used. The most common modern methods include:
* fitting a mathematical formula (such as the Gompertz function, or an extension of it) to the data.
* looking at an established mortality table derived from a larger population and making a simple adjustment to it (such as multiplying by a constant factor) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively small amounts of data.)
* looking at the mortality rates actually experienced at each age and applying a piecewise model (such as by cubic splines) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively large amounts of data.)

The age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them. The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.

The life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.

As discussed above, on an individual basis, some factors correlate with longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use (including smoking and alcohol consumption), disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.

==Healthy life expectancy==
To assess the quality of these additional years of life, &#x27;healthy life expectancy&#x27; has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called Healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in &quot;full health&quot; excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury. Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan &quot;Healthy People 2010&quot;. More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.

The long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a more promising focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person&#x27;s &quot;healthspan&quot;. Besides the benefits of keeping people healthier longer, a goal is to reduce health-care expenses on the many diseases associated with cellular senescence. Approaches being explored include fasting, exercise, and senolytic drugs.

==Forecasting==
Forecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.

Life expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:

# Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using ARIMA or other time-series extrapolation procedures. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.
# Forecasting age-specific death rates and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods. This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model, which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman&#x27;s R package called &#x27;demography&#x27; and UC Berkeley&#x27;s LCFIT system.

==Policy uses==
Life expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.

Life expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.

Disparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907). There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = −0.620).

==Life expectancy vs. other measures of longevity==

Life expectancy may be confused with the average age an adult could expect to live, creating the misunderstanding that an adult&#x27;s lifespan would be unlikely to exceed their life expectancy at birth. This is not the case, as life expectancy is an average of the lifespans of all individuals, including those who die before adulthood. One may compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.

As a measure of the years of life remaining, life expectancy decreases with age after initially rising in early childhood, but the average age to which a person is likely to live increases as they survive to successive higher ages. In the table above, the estimated modern hunter-gatherer average expectation of life at birth of 33 years (often considered an upper-bound for Paleolithic populations) equates to a life expectancy at 15 of 39 years, so that those surviving to age 15 will on average die at 54.

In England in the 13th–19th centuries with life expectancy at birth rising from perhaps 25 years to over 40, expectation of life at age 30 has been estimated at 20–30 years, giving an average age at death of about 50–60 for those (a minority at the start of the period but two-thirds at its end) surviving beyond their twenties.

The table above gives the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles as 30–33, but having surviving to the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy could expect to live:
* 1200–1300: to age 64
* 1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the bubonic plague)
* 1400–1500: to age 69
* 1500–1550: to age 71

A further concept is that of modal age at death, the single age when deaths among a population are more numerous than at any other age. In all pre-modern societies the most common age at death is the first year of life: it is only as infant mortality falls below around 33–34 per thousand (roughly a tenth of estimated ancient and medieval levels) that deaths in a later year of life (usually around age 80) become more numerous. While the most common age of death in adulthood among modern hunter-gatherers (often taken as a guide to the likely most favourable Paleolithic demographic experience) is estimated to average 72 years, the number dying at that age is dwarfed by those (over a fifth of all infants) dying in the first year of life, and only around a quarter usually survive to the higher age.

Maximum life span is an individual-specific concept, and therefore is an upper bound rather than an average. Science author Christopher Wanjek writes, &quot;[H]as the human race increased its life span? Not at all. This is one of the biggest misconceptions about old age: we are not living any longer.&quot; The maximum life span, or oldest age a human can live, may be constant. Further, there are many examples of people living significantly longer than the average life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates (71), Saint Anthony the Great (105), Michelangelo (88), and John Adams (90).

However, anthropologist John D. Hawks criticizes the popular conflation of life span (life expectancy) and maximum life span when popular science writers falsely imply that the average adult human does not live longer than their ancestors. He writes, &quot;[a]ge-specific mortality rates have declined across the adult lifespan. A smaller fraction of adults die at 20, at 30, at 40, at 50, and so on across the lifespan. As a result, we live longer on average... In every way we can measure, human lifespans are longer today than in the immediate past, and longer today than they were 2000 years ago... age-specific mortality rates in adults really have reduced substantially.&quot;

<text>Lesser Poland, often known by its Polish name Małopolska (; ), is a historical region situated in southern and south-eastern Poland. Its capital and largest city is Kraków. Throughout centuries, Lesser Poland developed a separate culture featuring diverse architecture, folk costumes, dances, cuisine, traditions and a rare Lesser Polish dialect. The region is rich in historical landmarks, monuments, castles, natural scenery and UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The region should not be confused with the modern Lesser Poland Voivodeship, which covers only the southwestern part of Lesser Poland. Historical Lesser Poland was much larger than the current voivodeship that bears its name. It reached from Bielsko-Biała in the southwest as far as to Siedlce in the northeast. It consisted of the three voivodeships of Kraków, Sandomierz and Lublin.

It comprised almost 60,000 km2 in area; today&#x27;s population in this area is about 9,000,000 inhabitants. Its landscape is mainly hilly, with the Carpathian Mountains and Tatra Mountain Range in the south; it is located in the basin of the upper Vistula river. It has been noted for its mighty aristocracy (&quot;magnateria&quot;) and wealthy nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;).

Between the 14th and 18th century, the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland also encompassed the historical regions of Podlachia, Volhynia, Podolia and Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities. In the era of partitions, the southern part of Lesser Poland became known as Galicia, which was under Austrian control until Poland regained its independence in 1918. As a result of this long-lasting division, many inhabitants of the northern part of Lesser Poland (including those in such cities as Lublin, Radom, Kielce and Częstochowa) do not recognize their Lesser Polish identity. 
However, while Lublin &quot;(Lubelskie)&quot; was declared an independent Voivodeship as early as 1474, it still has speakers of the Lesser Polish dialect.

Across history, many ethnic and religious minorities existed in Lesser Poland as they fled persecution from other areas or countries. Poland&#x27;s once tolerant policy towards these minorities allowed them to flourish and create separate self-governing communities. Some minorities still remain, but are on the verge of extinction, most notably Wymysorys-speaking Vilamovians, Halcnovians, Gorals, Lemkos, and once Polish Jews and Walddeutsche Germans.

== Geography and boundaries ==
Lesser Poland lies in the area of the upper confluence of the Vistula river and covers a large upland, including the Świętokrzyskie Mountains with the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland further west, Małopolska Upland, Sandomierz Basin, and Lublin Upland. Unlike other historical parts of the country, such as Kujawy, Mazovia, Podlachia, Pomerania, or Greater Poland, Lesser Poland is mainly hilly, with Poland&#x27;s highest peak, Rysy, located within the borders of the province. Flat are northern and central areas of the province – around Tarnobrzeg, Stalowa Wola, Radom and Siedlce, also valleys of the main rivers – the Vistula, the Pilica, and the San. Apart from Rysy, there are several other peaks located in the province – Pilsko, Babia Góra, Turbacz, as well as Łysica in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. The southern part of the province is covered by the Carpathian Mountains, which are made of smaller ranges, such as Pieniny, Tatry, and Beskidy.


Almost the whole area is located in the Vistula Basin, with the exception of the western and southern parts, belonging to the Odra and Dunaj Basins. The main rivers of the province are the Vistula, upper Warta, Soła, Skawa, Raba, Dunajec, Wisłok, Wisłoka, San, Wieprz, Przemsza, Nida, Kamienna, Radomka, and Pilica. The major lakes of the province are Lake Rożnów, Lake Czchów, Lake Dobczyce, Lake Czorsztyn, Lake Czaniec, Lake Międzybrodzie, Lake Klimkówka and Żywiec Lake. Most of them are man-made reservoirs.

Lesser Poland stretches from the Carpathians in the south to Pilica and Liwiec rivers to the north. It borders Mazovia to the north, Podlaskie to the northeast, Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities to the east, Slovakia to the south, Silesia to the west, and Greater Poland to the northwest. Currently, the region is divided between Polish voivodeships – Lesser Poland Voivodeship (whole), Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship (whole), Silesian Voivodeship (eastern half), Podkarpackie Voivodeship (western part), Masovian Voivodeship (southern part), Łódź Voivodeship (southeastern corner), and Lublin Voivodeship (western part).

In Silesian Voivodeship, the border between Silesia and Lesser Poland is easy to draw, because, with only a few exceptions, it goes along boundaries of local counties. In the south, it goes along the western boundary of the ancient Duchy of Teschen, with the borderline along the Biała river, with Zwardoń, Milówka and Rajcza located in Lesser Poland. Bielsko-Biała is a city made up of two parts – Lesser Poland&#x27;s Biala (also called &quot;Biala Krakowska&quot;), makes up the eastern half of the city, and only in 1951 was it merged with Silesian Bielsko. Further north, the border goes along the western boundaries of the cities of Jaworzno, and Sosnowiec, along the Przemsza and Brynica rivers. Then it goes northwest, leaving Czeladź, Siewierz, Koziegłowy, Blachownia, Kłobuck and Krzepice within Lesser Poland. From Krzepice, the border goes eastwards, towards Koniecpol, and along the Pilica river, with such towns as Przedborz, Opoczno, Drzewica, Białobrzegi, and Kozienice located within Lesser Poland. East of Białobrzegi, the boundary goes mainly along the Radomka river, to the Vistula. East of the Vistula, the boundary goes north of Łaskarzew and Żelechów, and south of Mazovian town of Garwolin, turning northwest. The northernmost point of the province is marked by the Liwiec river, with both Siedlce, and Łuków being part of Lesser Poland. The line then goes south, with Miedzyrzec Podlaski being part of the historical Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and Radzyń Podlaski as well as Parczew left in Lesser Poland.

Between the Vistula and the Bug Rivers, the eastern border of Lesser Poland goes west of Leczna, but east of Krasnystaw and Szczebrzeszyn, both of which historically belong to Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities. Further south, Lesser Poland includes Frampol, and Biłgoraj, which lie in the southeastern corner on Lesser Poland&#x27;s historical Lublin Voivodeship, close to the border with Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities. The border then goes west of Biłgoraj, turning south, towards Leżajsk (which belongs to Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities). The boundary between Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities was described by Ukrainian historian and geographer Myron Korduba as being along the line Dukla – Krosno – Domaradz – Czudec – Krzeszów nad Sanem. The border towns of Lesser Poland were: Rudnik, Kolbuszowa, Ropczyce, Sędziszów Małopolski, Strzyżów, Jasło, Gorlice, and Biecz. The southern border of Lesser Poland goes along the Carpathian Mountains, and, except in a few cases, it has not changed for centuries. The cities of Leżajsk, Rzeszów, Sanok, Brzozów, and Krosno do not belong to historical Lesser Poland, as they are part of Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities (Lwów Voivodeship, around today&#x27;s Lviv, Ukraine).

Historically, Lesser Poland was divided into two lands - Kraków Land and Sandomierz Land, both of which emerged after the Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty. In the 14th century, Sandomierz Voivodeship and Kraków Voivodeship were created, and in 1474, Lublin Voivodeship was carved out of three Sandomierz Voivodeship counties, located on the right bank of the Vistula. Historian Adolf Pawiński, who in the late 19th century was the director of the Polish Central Archives of Historical Records, estimated in his book &quot;Polska XVI wieku pod względem geograficzno-statystycznym&quot;, that the size of Kraków Voivodeship was 19,028 km2. Sandomierz Voivodeship had an area of 25,762 km2, and Lublin Voivodeship had an area of 11,033 km2. Together with the Duchy of Siewierz (607 km2), and the parts of Spiš that belonged to Poland after the Treaty of Lubowla (1211 km2), the total area of Lesser Poland was 57,640 square kilometers. Apart from the three historic lands, Lesser Poland includes other smaller regions, such as Podhale, Ponidzie, and Zagłębie Dąbrowskie.

== Etymology ==
Zygmunt Gloger in his work &quot;Historical geography of land of ancient Poland&quot; (&quot;Geografia historyczna ziem dawnej Polski&quot;) states that according to a Polish custom, whenever a new village was formed next to an older one, the name of the new entity was presented with an adjective &quot;little&quot; (or &quot;lesser&quot;), while the old village was described as &quot;greater&quot;. The same procedure was used in naming two Polish provincesthe &quot;older&quot; one, the cradle of the Polish state, was called &quot;Greater Poland&quot;, and its &quot;younger sister&quot;, which became part of Poland a few years later, was called &quot;Lesser Poland&quot;. The name Greater Poland (&quot;Polonia Maior&quot;) was for the first time used in 1242, by princes Boleslaw and Przemysław I, who named themselves &quot;Duces Majoris Poloniae&quot; (&quot;Princes of the Older Poland&quot;). Lesser Poland, or &quot;Polonia Minor&quot;, appeared for the first time in historical documents in 1493, in the Statutes of Piotrków, during the reign of King Jan Olbracht, to distinguish this province from Greater Poland (&quot;Polonia Maior&quot;).

== History ==


=== Early period and Kingdom of Poland ===
In the first years of Polish statehood, southern Lesser Poland was inhabited by the West Slavic tribe of Vistulans, with two major centers in Kraków and Wiślica. Their land, which had probably been part of Great Moravia, and Bohemia, was annexed by Mieszko I of Poland some time in the late 10th century. Cosmas of Prague in his &quot;Chronicle of Bohemians&quot; wrote: &quot;Polish prince Mieszko, a cunning man, seized by ruse the city of Kraków, killing with sword all Czechs he found there&quot;. Northern part of Lesser Poland (Lublin and Sandomierz) was probably inhabited by another tribe, the Lendians, and Dr Antoni Podraza, historian of the Jagiellonian University claims that ancient division of Lesser Poland into two major parts – Land (Duchy) of Kraków, and Land (Duchy) of Sandomierz, is based on the existence of two Slavic tribes in the area. However, exact location of the Lendians has not been determined to this day. Some historians speculate that they occupied Cherven Cities, and their center was in Przemyśl.
Around the year 1000, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kraków was created, and its borders covered whole area of Lesser Poland. During the reign of Casimir I the Restorer, Kraków for the first time became the capital of Poland (around 1040), since Greater Poland and Silesia, with main Polish urban centers, such as Gniezno and Poznań were ravaged by Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia. In 1138, following the Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty, the country was divided between his sons (see also Fragmentation of Poland). Bolesław III Wrymouth created the Seniorate Province, which, among others, consisted of Kraków. At the same time, Lesser Poland was divided into two parts, when its eastern part formed the Duchy of Sandomierz, carved by the ruler for his son Henry of Sandomierz.

During the fragmentation period, both lands of Lesser Poland were frequently ruled by the same prince. Among them were Bolesław IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old, Casimir II the Just, Leszek I the White, Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black, Władysław I the Elbow-high, and King of Bohemia, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, who united Lesser Poland in 1290/1291. The province was pillaged during the Mongol invasion of Poland, when a combined army of Kraków and Sandomierz was destroyed by Baidar in the Battle of Chmielnik. The loss was so heavy that Norman Davies wrote: &quot;At Chmielnik, the assembled nobility of Małopolska perished to a man.&quot; During their 1241, 1259, and 1287 invasions, the Mongols burned major cities of Lesser Poland, killing thousands of people. Furthermore, the province, especially its northeastern part, was often raided by the Lithuanians, Rusyns, Yotvingians, and Old Prussians. The city of Lublin suffered most frequently – among others, it was burnt by the Rusyns in 1244, the Lithuanians 1255, the Prussians in 1266, and the Yotvingians in 1282. Another center of the province, Sandomierz, was destroyed by the Tartars in 1260, and burnt by the Lithuanians in 1349.

Unlike other Polish provinces, especially Silesia, Lesser Poland did not undergo further fragmentation, and in the early 14th century became the core of the reunited nation (together with Greater Poland). The period of nation&#x27;s fragmentation came to a symbolic end on 30 January 1320, when Władysław I the Elbow-high was crowned as King of Poland. The ceremony took place in Kraków&#x27;s Wawel Cathedral, and the king of the reunited country decided to choose Kraków as the capital. Through 14th and 15th centuries, Lesser Poland&#x27;s position as the most important province of the nation was cemented. It became visible during the reign of Casimir III the Great, who favored less known Lesser Poland&#x27;s noble families, at the expense of Greater Poland&#x27;s nobility. The reign of Casimir the Great was a period of growing prosperity of Lesser Poland. With high density of population, fertile soils and rich deposits of minerals (especially salt in Bochnia and Wieliczka, as well as lead in Olkusz), the province was the richest part of Poland. After the recapture of the Cherven Cities/Red Ruthenia, Lesser Poland lost its status of the borderland, and both regions created an economic bridge between Poland and the ports of the Black Sea. The king, who drew Jewish settlers from across Europe to his country, built several castles along western border of Lesser Poland, with the most notable ones in Skawina, Pieskowa Skała, Będzin, Lanckorona, Olkusz, Lelów, Bobolice, Krzepice, Ogrodzieniec, Ojców, Olsztyn, Bobolice, Mirów (see also Eagle Nests Trail). Furthermore, he built or strengthened castles in other parts of the province, such as Szydlow, Chęciny, Wiślica, Radom, Niedzica, Opoczno, Lublin, Sandomierz, as well as the Wawel Castle. Also, during his reign (1333–1370), Casimir the Great founded on Magdeburg rights several cities, urbanizing hitherto rural province. Among major Lesser Poland&#x27;s cities founded by the King, there are:

In the Kingdom of Poland, Lesser Poland was made of three voivodeships – Kraków Voivodeship, Sandomierz Voivodeship, and Lublin Voivodeship, created in 1474 out of eastern part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship. Borders of the province remained unchanged until 1772. The only exception was large part of contemporary Upper Silesia (the area around Bytom, Toszek, Siewierz, and Oświęcim), which belonged to Duchy of Kraków until 1179. In that year, prince of Kraków Casimir II the Just, handed these lands to Prince of Opole Mieszko I Tanglefoot. The Duchy of Siewierz, ruled since 1443 by the Archbishop of Kraków, merged with Lesser Poland in 1790. Other Silesian realms lost in 1179, also returned to Lesser Poland – Duchy of Zator (in 1513), and Duchy of Oświęcim (1564). Both duchies merged into a Silesian County of the Kraków Voivodeship, and shared the fate of Lesser Poland. Apart from Jews, among other ethnic minorities of the province were the Walddeutsche, who settled the borderland of Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia (14th through 17th centuries). In the Middle Ages, the Germans inhabited several cities of Lesser Poland, especially Kraków and Sandomierz (see Rebellion of wójt Albert).

In the late Middle Ages, Lesser Poland gradually became the center of Polish statehood, with Kraków being the capital of the country from the mid-11th century until 1596. Its nobility ruled Poland when Queen Jadwiga was too young to control the state, and the Union of Krewo with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the brainchild of Lesser Poland&#x27;s szlachta.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Lesser Poland remained the most important part of the country. After the death of Casimir the Great, Lesser Poland&#x27;s nobility promoted Louis I of Hungary as the new king, later supporting his daughter Jadwiga of Poland in exchange for Privilege of Koszyce. Since Jadwiga, crowned on 16 October 1384, was too young to rule the country, Poland was in fact governed by the Lesser Poland&#x27;s nobility, who decided to find her a husband, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Jogaila. Consequently, unions of Poland and Lithuania at Krewo and Horodło were the brainchildren of Lesser Poland&#x27;s nobility, among whom the most influential individuals were Spytek z Melsztyna, and cardinal Zbigniew Olesnicki. Other famous Lesser Poland&#x27;s families are Lubomirski family, Kmita family, Tarnowski family, Potocki family, Sobieski family, Koniecpolski family, Ossolinski family, Poniatowski family.

Since Lesser Poland was the most important province of the country, several important events took place on its territory. In 1364, Casimir the Great called the Congress of Kraków, and in 1401, the Union of Vilnius and Radom was signed. In 1505 in Radom, the Sejm adopted the Nihil novi title, which forbade the King to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. In the same year, also in the same city, Polish law was codified in the Łaski&#x27;s Statute, and the Crown Tribunal (the highest appeal court in the Crown of the Polish Kingdom) held its sessions in Lublin. In 1525, the Treaty of Kraków was signed, ending the Polish–Teutonic War. Lesser Poland also is home to the oldest Polish university – the Jagiellonian University, founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great, and several outstanding figures of early Polish culture were born here, such as Jan Kochanowski, Mikołaj Rej, Jan z Lublina, Mikołaj Gomółka, Maciej Miechowita, Marcin Kromer, Łukasz Górnicki, and Mikołaj Radomski.

=== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ===
In the 16th century, Lesser Poland retained its position as the most important province of the country. As no major conflicts took place on its territory, it was the center of Renaissance in Poland. The province was home to numerous scholars, writers and statesmen, and it was here where Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was created in 1569 (see Union of Lublin). In the Commonwealth, Lesser Poland proper was the base of the Lesser Poland Province, which covered southern lands of the vast country. The province was made of Lesser Poland itself, also Podlachia, Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities, Volhynia, Podolia, and Ukrainian voivodeships of Kijów (Kyiv) and Czernihów (Chernihiv), which, until 1569, had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The period in Polish history known as the Polish Golden Age was very fortunate for Lesser Poland. Kings of the Jagiellonian dynasty, especially Sigismund I the Old (himself born in Lesser Poland&#x27;s Kozienice), and his son Sigismund II Augustus (born in Kraków), resided in Kraków, which was the capital of the immense Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lesser Poland&#x27;s prosperity was reflected in numerous examples of Renaissance architecture complexes, built across the province. In 1499, hitherto Gothic Wawel Castle was damaged in a fire, and a few years later, Sigismund I, with help of the best native and foreign artists (such as Francesco the Florentine, Bartholomeo Berrecci or Niccolo Castiglione) refurbished the complex into a splendid Renaissance palace. Furthermore, in the early 16th century, several palaces were built in Lesser Poland – in Drzewica, Szydłowiec, Ogrodzieniec, and Pieskowa Skała. The province became rich mostly due to the grain trade, conducted along the Vistula, and among cities which prospered in the 16th century, there are Kraków, Sandomierz, Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, Pilzno, Tarnów, Radom, Biecz. In later years of the 16th century, further palaces were built or remodelled in Baranow Sandomierski, and Niepołomice.

In the early 16th century, Protestant Reformation spread across the Commonwealth, and Lesser Poland became one of early centers of the movement, when students from Wittenberg brought the news to Cracow. In the first years of the century, professor of Jagiellonian University Jakub of Iłża (Jakub z Ilzy, died 1542) became one of the main promoters of the movement in the region. He actively supported the notions of Martin Luther, and in 1528 was called to the Bishop of Kraków&#x27;s court. Convinced of heresy, he was forced to leave Poland in 1535. Reformation soon became very popular among Lesser Poland&#x27;s nobility, especially Calvinism, and according to one estimate, some 20% of local szlachta converted from Roman Catholicism. They were attracted by Calvinism&#x27;s democratic character, and Lesser Poland&#x27;s center of the movement was set in the town of Pińczów, which came to be known as &quot;Sarmatian Athens&quot;. It was in Pińczów, where a local nobleman converted a Roman Catholic parish into a Protestant one, opened a Calvinist Academy, and published its Antitrinitarian confession in 1560 and in 1561. Several Calvinist synods took place in Lesser Poland – the first one in Słomniki (1554), Pińczów (the first united Synod of Poland and Lithuania – 1556 1561), and Kraków (1562). In 1563, also in Pińczów, the so-called Brest Bible was translated into Polish. In 1570, the Sandomierz Agreement was signed by a number of Protestant groups, with the exception of the Polish Brethren, another religious group very influential in Lesser Poland. The Brethren had their center in Lesser Poland&#x27;s village of Raków, where a main Arian printing press, as well as a college, known as Akademia Rakowska (&quot;Gymnasium Bonarum Artium&quot;) founded in 1602 were located. Among distinguished European scholars associated with the school, there were Johannes Crellius, Corderius, and Valentinus Smalcius (who translated into German the Racovian Catechism).

In 1572, the Jagiellon dynasty died out, and next year, Henry III of France became first elected king of the country. After his short reign, and War of the Polish Succession (1587–88), which also took place in Lesser Poland, the new ruler was Stephen Báthory of Poland, who died in 1586. The ruler from Transylvania was followed by Sigismund III Vasa of Sweden, whose election marked gradual decline of the province. Sigismund&#x27;s eyes were set on Sweden, and for many years he concentrated his efforts on a futile attempt to regain his former Swedish throne (see Polish–Swedish union, War against Sigismund). Therefore, Lesser Poland, located in southwestern corner of the Commonwealth, began to lose its importance, which was marked in 1596, when Sigismund moved his permanent residence, court and the crown headquarters to centrally-located Warsaw.
Even though first half of the 17th century was filled with wars, all major conflicts did not reach Lesser Poland, and the province continued to prosper, which was reflected in its castles and palaces, such as the enormous Krzyztopor. Apart from minor wars, such as Zebrzydowski Rebellion, and Kostka-Napierski Uprising, the province remained safe. Cossacks of the Khmelnytsky Uprising reached as far west as Zamość and Lwów, but did not enter Lesser Poland. The province did not witness other wars, such as Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629), Polish–Russian War (1609–1618), Polish–Ottoman War (1620–1621), and Smolensk War. Nevertheless, Lesser Poland&#x27;s nobility took active part in these conflicts – Marina Mniszech, the daughter of Voivode of Sandomierz, Jerzy Mniszech, was wife of False Dmitriy I, as well as False Dmitriy II. Furthermore, Lesser Poland&#x27;s lands, especially its northeastern part, became a base for Polish troops, fighting the Cossacks, and King John II Casimir Vasa often stayed in Lublin with his court, preparing military campaigns in Ukraine. The situation changed with the outbreak of the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). In October 1655, the Russo-Cossack armies under Ivan Vyhovsky entered Eastern Lesser Poland, reaching the Vistula, and pillaging Lublin, Puławy, and Kazimierz Dolny. The invaders quickly retreated, but a few months later, Lesser Poland was flooded by the Swedes.

Swedish invasion of Poland had catastrophic consequences for the hitherto prosperous province. The attackers, supported by their allies from Transylvania, seized whole Lesser Poland, reaching as far south as Nowy Targ, Nowy Sącz, and Żywiec. All major cities were looted and burned, and some of them, like Radom, did not recover until the 19th century. The Swedes captured and pillaged Sandomierz (where they destroyed the Royal Castle, and after the invasion, the city never recovered), Opoczno, Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny Pilzno, Szydlow, Szydłowiec, Tarnów, Kielce, Kraśnik, and Kraków. The invaders seized the capital of Lesser Poland after a short siege, and their occupation of the province was confirmed after their victories in the Battle of Wojnicz, and the Battle of Golab. In those years, one of the most important and symbolic events in the history of the nation took place in Lesser Poland. It was the Siege of Jasna Góra, which, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war. Furthermore, following the Treaty of Radnot, Lesser Poland was invaded in January 1657 by George II Rákóczi, whose troops caused more destruction. Foreign armies were not chased out of Lesser Poland until 1657, Kraków itself was recaptured on 18 August 1657. After these invasions, the province was ruined, with hundreds of villages, towns and cities burned. The population decreased (the urban population by nearly half), the peasantry starved, and like other parts of the Commonwealth, Lesser Poland was devastated. The period of peace lasted for about forty years, when in 1700, another major conflict, the Great Northern War began. Lesser Poland once again became a battleground, with Battle of Kliszów taking place there in 1702, and the Sandomierz Confederation formed in 1704.

After the conflict, Lesser Poland began a recovery, which was hampered by several other factors. Province&#x27;s cities frequently burned (Lublin 1719, Nowy Targ 1784, Nowy Sącz, Dukla 1758, Wieliczka 1718, Miechów 1745, Drzewica), there also were numerous outbreaks of plagues and typhus (in 1707–1708, some 20,000 died in Kraków and its area)

Lesser Poland was one of main centers of the Bar Confederation. On 21 June 1786 in Kraków, local confederation was announced, and on the same day Voievode of Kraków, Michal Czarnocki, urged his citizens to join the movement. Soon afterwards, Kraków was captured by the Russian troops, and the center of Lesser Poland&#x27;s insurgency moved to the mountainous south – areas around Dukla and Nowy Sącz. During the Confederation, several battles and skirmishes took place there. In 1770, after the Battle of Iwonicz, the Russians ransacked Biecz. The movement ended in 1772, and its decline was connected with the Partitions of Poland. Another local center of the movement was Jasna Góra Monastery in Częstochowa, which was defended by Kazimierz Pulaski for almost two years (1770–1772).

=== Partitions of Poland (1772–1918) ===
The Partitions of Poland began earlier in Lesser Poland than in other provinces of the country. In 1769, Austrian Empire annexed a small territory of Spisz, and next year, the towns of Czorsztyn, Nowy Sącz and Nowy Targ. In 1771, the Russians and the Prussians agreed on the first partition of the country, and in early 1772, Austrian Emperor Maria Theresa decided to join the two powers. In the first partition of the Commonwealth, the Austrians seized the territory which would later be called Galicia, and which included southwestern corner of Lesser Poland (south of the Vistula river), with Żywiec, Tarnów, and Biecz, but without major urban centers of the province, such as Kraków, Sandomierz, Radom, Lublin, Częstochowa, and Kielce.

Second Partition of Poland (1793) did not result in significant changes of boundaries in the area, as the Austrian Empire did not participate in it. However, the Prussians moved on, and in 1793 they annexed northwestern corner of the province, together with the city of Częstochowa, and its vicinity, which became part of the newly created province of South Prussia. Therefore, in late 1793, Lesser Poland was already divided between three countries – Austrian Empire (south of the Vistula), Kingdom of Prussia (Częstochowa and northwestern corner), and still existing Commonwealth. After the Third Partition (1795), most of Lesser Poland was annexed by Austria, with all major cities. Prussia managed to seize a small, western part of the province, with the towns of Siewierz, Zawiercie, Będzin, and Myszków, calling this land New Silesia, while the Austrians decided to name newly acquired lands of northern Lesser Poland West Galicia. In 1803, West Galicia was merged with Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, but retained some autonomy. Lesser Poland was one of major centers of Polish resistance against the occupiers. On 24 March 1794 in Kraków, Tadeusz Kościuszko announced the general insurrection (see Kościuszko Uprising), mobilising all able males of Lesser Poland. Two weeks later, Battle of Racławice took place, ending with a Polish victory. The uprising was suppressed by combined Prusso – Russian forces, and among battles fought in Lesser Poland, there is Battle of Szczekociny.

During Napoleonic Wars, the Duchy of Warsaw was created by Napoleon Bonaparte out of Polish lands which had been granted to Prussia in the Partitions. In 1809, after the Polish–Austrian War, and the Treaty of Schönbrunn, the Duchy was expanded, when northern Lesser Poland was added to its territory (with Kielce, Radom, and Lublin). Following the Congress of Vienna, Duchy of Warsaw was turned into Russian-ruled Congress Poland, and historical capital of the province, Kraków, was turned into Free City of Kraków, which also included the towns of Trzebinia, Chrzanów, Jaworzno, and Krzeszowice. In Congress Poland, the lands of Lesser Poland were initially divided between four palatinates – Palatinate of Kraków (with capital in Kielce), Palatinate of Sandomierz (with capital in Radom), Palatinate of Lublin, and Palatinate of Podlasie (with capital in Siedlce), (see also Administrative division of Congress Poland). Later, the palatinates were turned into governorates. Thus, Russian part of Lesser Poland was divided into Kielce Governorate, Lublin Governorate, Radom Governorate, Siedlce Governorate, and Piotrków Governorate (western counties, with Częstochowa and industrial area of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie). Borders of these administrative units did not reflect historical boundaries of the province.
Most of the November Uprising, which began in 1830, missed Lesser Poland, as major battles took place in the area around Warsaw. In early 1831, when Russian forces advanced into Congress Poland, some skirmishes took place in northern counties of the province – at Puławy, Kurow, and Kazimierz Dolny. In early 1846, a group of Polish patriots attempted a failed uprising in the Free City of Kraków. The insurrection was quickly suppressed by the Austrian troops, and as a result, the Free City was annexed by the Austrian Empire. In the same year, Austrian part of Lesser Poland was witness to a massacre of Polish nobility by the peasantry, known as Galician slaughter. The peasants, led by Jakub Szela, murdered about 1000 nobles, and destroyed about 500 manors. These events took place in three counties – Sanok, Jasło and Tarnów.

Northern and central Lesser Poland (the part of the province which was taken by the Russian Empire) was one of the main centers of the January Uprising (1863–1864). In the first days of the insurrection, skirmishes with the Russian Army took place in such towns, as Łuków, Kraśnik, Szydłowiec, Bodzentyn, and Suchedniów. Since the Poles were poorly armed, the Russians did not have major problems with them, and soon afterwards, the insurrectionists decided to organize military camps. Among biggest camps in Lesser Poland, there were Ojców (3000 soldiers), and Wąchock, where Marian Langiewicz gathered up to 1500 people. The uprising died out by early spring of 1864, and among counties where it continued for the longest time, was the extreme northeastern corner of Lesser Poland, around Łuków, where reverend Stanisław Brzóska was active. Since Russian military supremacy was crushing, the Poles were forced to limit their actions to guerrilla warfare. Among the biggest battles which took place in Lesser Poland there are: Battle of Szydłowiec (23 January 1863); Battle of Miechów (17 February 1863); Battle of Małogoszcz (24 February 1863); Battle of Staszów (17 February 1863); Battle of Pieskowa Skała (4 March 1863); two Battles of Opatów (25 November 1863, 21 February 1864).

As a result of their support of the failed insurrection, several Lesser Poland&#x27;s towns lost their charters and were turned into villages. Among them were Kraśnik, Bodzentyn, Opatów, Iłża, Małogoszcz, Wąchock, Busko-Zdrój, Jędrzejów, Cmielow, Zwoleń, Drzewica, Wierzbica, Czeladź, Kazimierz Dolny, Wolborz, Stopnica, Daleszyce, Wiślica, Pajęczno, Lipsko, Pacanów, Ożarów, Wolbrom, Proszowice, Nowe Miasto Korczyn, Włoszczowa, Przysucha, Opole Lubelskie.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lesser Poland remained one of the centers of Polish culture, especially the city of Kraków, where Jagiellonian University was one of only two Polish-language colleges of that period (the other one was University of Lwów). Another significant center of national culture was the town of Puławy, where in the late 18th century, a local palace owned by Czartoryski family became a museum of Polish national memorabilia and a major cultural and political centre. A number of prominent artists, both representing Romanticism, and Positivism was born in Lesser Poland, including Wincenty Pol (born in Lublin), Stefan Żeromski (born near Kielce), Aleksander Świętochowski (born near Łuków in extreme northeast corner of Lesser Poland), Walery Przyborowski (born near Kielce), Piotr Michałowski, Helena Modjeska, Henryk Wieniawski (born in Lublin), Leon Wyczółkowski (born near Siedlce), Juliusz Kossak (born in Nowy Wiśnicz), Józef Szujski (born in Tarnów). In the early 20th century, Lesser Poland, especially its part which belonged to Austria-Hungary, was a center of a cultural movement called Young Poland. Many artists associated with the movement were born in Lesser Poland, with the most prominent including Władysław Orkan, Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Xawery Dunikowski, Jacek Malczewski, Józef Mehoffer, and Stanisław Wyspiański.

Since Austrian part of Poland enjoyed a wide autonomy, the province of Galicia, whose western part was made of Lesser Poland, became a hotbed of Polish conspirational activities. In anticipation of a future war, Galician Poles, with help of their brethren from other parts of the divided country, created several paramilitary organizations, such as Polish Rifle Squads, and Riflemen&#x27;s Association. The capital of Lesser Poland, Kraków, was a key center of pro-independence movements, with such individuals, as Józef Piłsudski, being actively involved in those activities. In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, Pilsudski&#x27;s Legions crossed the Austrian – Russian border north of Kraków, and entered Congress Poland. However, the Pilsudski and his soldiers were disappointed to see that the inhabitants of Kielce did not welcome them with joy. The division of Lesser Poland was more visible than ever.
During World War I, Lesser Poland became one of main theaters of the Eastern Front. Russian push into the territory of Austria – Hungary resulted in the Battle of Galicia. Among other major battles which took place in Lesser Poland, there are the Battle of the Vistula River, and the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive. After Russian troops had retreated east, whole province was under control of the Austrians and the Germans, and northern Lesser Poland was part of the German-sponsored Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918). In later stages of the conflict, the divided province once again became a center of Polish independence movement. An independent Polish government was re-proclaimed in northern Lesser Poland&#x27;s city of Lublin, on 7 November 1918. Soon afterwards, it formed the basis of the new government of the country. In other parts of the province, other governments were formed – Polish Liquidation Commission in Kraków, also the short-lived Republic of Tarnobrzeg.

The division of Lesser Poland along the Vistula river, which lasted from 1772 until 1918, is visible even today. For more than 100 years, southern Lesser Poland (Kraków, Tarnów, Biala Krakowska, and Nowy Sącz) was administered by Austria, while northern, larger part of the province (Częstochowa, Sosnowiec, Kielce, Radom, Lublin, Sandomierz) was forcibly part of the Russian Empire. Inhabitants of Austrian part of Poland enjoyed limited autonomy, with Polish language institutions, such as Jagiellonian University. At the same time, Russian-controlled Poland was subject to Russification. As a result of decades of this division, most inhabitants of the areas stolen by Russia are not aware of their Lesser Poland&#x27;s heritage. Furthermore, current administrative boundaries of the country still reflect the defunct border between the former Russian and Austria–Hungarian Empires.
=== Interwar Poland (1918–1939) ===
In 1918, when Second Polish Republic was created, whole historical Lesser Poland became part of restored Poland. The historical area of the province was divided between four voivodeships: Kraków Voivodeship (whole), Kielce Voivodeship (whole), Lwów Voivodeship (northwestern corner), and Lublin Voivodeship (western part). Furthermore, in the counties of central Lesser Poland, another administrative unit, Sandomierz Voivodeship was planned, but due to the outbreak of World War II, it was never created. Boundaries between two major Lesser Poland voivodeships – Kraków, and Kielce, were the same as pre-1914 boundaries of Austria-Hungary, and Russia. Nevertheless, in the interbellum period, the notion of Lesser Poland was frequently associated only with former Austrian province of Galicia. Therefore, Western Galicia to the San river, was called &quot;Western Lesser Poland&quot;, while Eastern Galicia, east of the San, with the city of Lwów (Lviv), was called &quot;Eastern Lesser Poland&quot; (voivodeships of Tarnopol, Stanisławów, and Lwów). According to a Polish historian Jan Pisuliński, using the term &quot;Eastern Lesser Poland&quot; to denomine Eastern Galicia is incorrect, as it has no historical justification, being only a designation of nationalist and propaganda significance (similarly to analogous term &quot;Western Ukraine&quot; used at the same time by the Ukrainian side), which served in the 1920s and 1930s to make a stronger connection of the area between rivers of San and Zbruch with the Polish state and to emphasize the allegedly indigenously Polish nature of that region.

In late 1918, Lesser Poland emerged as one of main centers of fledgling Polish administration and independence movement. According to historian Kazimierz Banburski of Tarnów&#x27;s District Museum, Tarnów was the first Polish city which became independent, after 123 years of oppression. On 31 October 1918, at 8 am, Tarnów&#x27;s inhabitants began disarming demoralized Austrian soldiers, and after three hours, the city was completely in Polish hands. On 28 October 1918, Polish Liquidation Committee was created in Kraków. A few days later, socialist peasants founded the Republic of Tarnobrzeg. In the night of 6/7 November 1918, &quot;Polish People&#x27;s Republic&quot; was proclaimed in Lublin, by Ignacy Daszynski and other activists. In 1919, the legislative election took place in Lesser Poland without major problems.

At that time Lesser Poland, like other provinces of the country, faced several problems. Even though major post-World War I conflicts (such as Polish–Soviet War) did not take place there, it suffered from unemployment, overpopulation, and poverty, especially in towns and countryside. Furthermore, Polish government had to connect parts of the hitherto divided country. There was no direct rail link between Kraków, and Kielce, Radom, and Lublin, and until 1934, when line from Kraków to Tunel was opened, all travelers had to go via Sosnowiec – Maczki. Lack of rail communication between former Austrian and former Russian parts of Lesser Poland is visible even today. Between Kraków and Dęblin, there are only two rail bridges along the Vistula. Residents of the province tried to improve their conditions using legal means, but when it turned out to be impossible, they took to fighting (1923 Kraków riot, 1937 peasant strike in Poland). As if to exacerbate the desperate situation, Lesser Poland witnessed a catastrophic flood in 1934, after which the government decided to construct dams on local rivers.

Even though Lesser Poland&#x27;s countryside was almost exclusively Polish, its towns and cities were inhabited by numerous Jews, whose communities were very vibrant. In Kraków, Jews made 25% of the population, in Lublin – 31%, in Kielce – 30%, and in Radom – 32%. Apart from the Jews, and Gypsies scattered in the south, there were no other significant national minorities in interbellum Lesser Poland.

Since Lesser Poland was safely located in the middle of the country, away from both German and Soviet border, in the mid-1930s Polish government initiated one of the most ambitious project of the Second Polish Republic – Central Industrial Region, which was located almost exclusively in Lesser Poland. Even though the project was never completed, several plants were constructed, both in Old-Polish Industrial Region, and in other counties of the province. The brand new city of Stalowa Wola was established in dense forests, around a steel mill. In the late 1930s, Lesser Poland was quickly changing, as construction of several factories, and job opportunities caused influx of rural inhabitants to the towns. Such towns, as Dębica, Starachowice, Puławy, or Kraśnik, quickly grew, with their population rising. Earlier, in 1927, Lesser Poland&#x27;s Dęblin became a major center of Polish aviation, when Polish Air Force Academy was opened there, and in Mielec, PZL Mielec was opened, which was the largest aerospace manufacturer in Poland. Central Industrial Region, however, did not affect western counties of Lesser Poland, which had already been urbanized and industrialized (Biala Krakowska, Żywiec, Kraków, Jaworzno, Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, Zawiercie, and Częstochowa). The government of Poland planned further investments, such as a major East – West rail line, linking Volhynia, and Upper Silesia, but they never materialized. Desperate situation and lack of jobs caused thousands of inhabitants of Lesser Poland (especially from its southern part) to leave their land, mostly for the United States of America, but also Brazil, and Canada.

Lesser Poland remained a center of Polish culture, with Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University, AGH University of Science and Technology, and Catholic University of Lublin, which was opened in 1918. Several important figures of interbellum political, military, and cultural life of Poland were born in Lesser Poland. Among them were Wincenty Witos, Władysław Sikorski, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki, Józef Haller, Władysław Belina-Prażmowski, Tadeusz Kutrzeba, Feliks Koneczny, Stefan Żeromski, Tadeusz Peiper, Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska, Witold Gombrowicz, Jan Kiepura, Stefan Jaracz. In 1920, in Lesser Poland&#x27;s town of Wadowice, Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, was born.

=== World War II ===
On 1 September 1939, armed forces of Nazi Germany attacked Poland (see: Invasion of Poland). Lesser Poland, due to its proximity to the then-border with Germany, became a battleground on the first day of the invasion. The Germans attacked the province both in its northwest (area west of Częstochowa), and in the south (Podhale), along the border with Slovakia, which also participated in the invasion.

Lesser Poland was defended by the following Polish armies:

* Karpaty Army, which covered southern, mountainous border of the province,
* Kraków Army, guarding western part of the province, together with adjacent Polish part of Upper Silesia. Later in the course of war it joined the Karpaty Army, forming the &quot;Lesser Poland Army&quot; (&quot;Armia Małopolska&quot;),
* Łódź Army, which protected extreme northwestern corner of the province, north of Częstochowa,
* Prusy Army, which was main reserve of the Commander in Chief, and was concentrated in central and northern Lesser Poland (between Radom and Kielce),
* Lublin Army, improvised after 4 September, and concentrated in the area of Lublin and Sandomierz in northEastern Lesser Poland.

After a few days the Battle of the Border was lost, and forces of German Army Group South advanced deep into Lesser Poland&#x27;s territory. Polish troops resisted fiercely, and among major battles in initial stages of the war, which took place in Lesser Poland, there are Battle of Mokra, Battle of Jordanów, and Battle of Węgierska Górka. By 6 September, Polish forces were in general retreat and Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły ordered all troops to fall back to the secondary lines of defences at the Vistula and San Rivers. German units entered Częstochowa on 3 September (where on the next day they murdered hundreds of civilians), Kielce on 5 September, Kraków on 6 September, and Radom on 8 September (see also Battle of Radom). Within a week, almost whole Lesser Poland was under Nazi occupation. Northeastern part of the province, the area of Lublin, was held by the Poles until 17 September, but eventually, and after fierce battles (see Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski), all Lesser Poland was firmly under Nazi control. First draft of Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact stipulated that northEastern Lesser Poland (east of the Vistula river) was to be occupied by the Soviet Union, and forces of the Red Army reached the area of Lublin after 20 September, but withdrew east on 28 September.

On 12 October 1939, upon a decree of Adolf Hitler, General Government, a separate region of the Greater German Reich was created, with Hans Frank as its Governor-General. Its capital was established in Kraków, and it covered most of the area of historical Lesser Poland, except for its western counties, which were directly incorporated into Nazi Germany&#x27;s Upper Silesia Province (Będzin, Sosnowiec, Zawiercie, Biała, Żywiec, Chrzanów, Olkusz).

In Lesser Poland, like in all provinces of the occupied country, the Nazis ruled with savage brutality, killing hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, both Polish and Jewish (see: World War II crimes in Poland, Occupation of Poland (1939–1945), Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Poland, Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles, German AB-Aktion in Poland, Sonderaktion Krakau). The Auschwitz concentration camp, located at the border of Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia, was opened on 14 June 1940, and on 1 October 1941, the Germans opened Majdanek concentration camp on the outskirts of Lublin. The third concentration camp in Lesser Poland was in Kraków&#x27;s district of Płaszów. In late 1939 and early 1940, in Lesser Poland&#x27;s spa of Zakopane, and in Kraków, several Gestapo–NKVD Conferences took place, during which the mutual cooperation between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union was discussed.

Anti-Nazi resistance was particularly strong in Lesser Poland, and it was in the extreme northwestern corner of the province (around Opoczno), that armed struggle against the occupiers began in late 1939 and early 1940 (see Henryk Dobrzański). Structures of the Home Army were well-developed in the region. Lesser Poland&#x27;s independent areas of the Home Army were located in Kraków, Kielce-Radom, and Lublin. During Operation Tempest in mid-1944, several Lesser Poland&#x27;s towns were liberated, also uprising in Kraków was prepared, but never realized. Apart from the Home Army, other resistance groups were strong in the province, such as pro-Communist Armia Ludowa, peasant&#x27;s Bataliony Chłopskie, and right-wing National Armed Forces, with its Holy Cross Mountains Brigade.

In all major Lesser Poland&#x27;s cities, Jewish ghettos were opened, with the biggest ones in Kraków, and Lublin. At first the Nazis were planning to create a so-called &quot;reservation&quot; for European Jews, located around Lesser Poland&#x27;s town of Nisko (see Nisko Plan), but they changed the plan, and decided to murder all Jews. Condemned to death, Jews in Lesser Poland took to fighting (see Częstochowa Ghetto Uprising), but their efforts failed. As a result of The Holocaust in Poland, once thriving and numerous Jewish population of Lesser Poland was decimated.

Germany operated several prisoner-of-war camps, including Stalag 301, Stalag 307, Stalag 359, Stalag 367, Stalag 369, Stalag 380, Stalag XII-C, Oflag 77, and multiple forced labour subcamps of Stalag VIII-B/344, for Polish, French, Belgian, Italian, Soviet, Dutch, Senegalese and other Allied POWs in the region.

In the summer of 1944, after Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive, Red Army pushed the Wehrmacht from Eastern Lesser Poland. The city of Lublin was captured by the Soviets on 22 July 1944, Stalowa Wola – on 1 August, and Sandomierz, on the left bank of the Vistula – on 18 August. The front line stabilized along the Vistula for about six months (with some bridgeheads on the western bank on the Vistula – see Battle of Studzianki), and in early 1945, Soviet Vistula–Oder Offensive began, which pushed Germans to the gates of Berlin. The Soviets entered Kielce on 15 January, Częstochowa – on 17 January, and Kraków on 19 January. On 27 January, the Red Army entered Sosnowiec. In took the Soviets much longer to clear the areas in the mountains – they did not enter Żywiec until 5 April 1945.

=== Post-World War II ===
Together with the Red Army, NKVD and Soviet authorities followed, whose purpose was to make Poland a Communist country, with a puppet government, formed as Polish Committee of National Liberation. Since 1 August 1944, the provisional government was officially headquartered in Lesser Poland&#x27;s Lublin. Thousands of people took to the forests, to continue their fight for free Poland (see Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–46)). Lesser Poland again was one of the main centers of the resistance. Several skirmishes took place in the province, including Battle of Kuryłówka. The Communists did not hesitate to kill those rebels they captured (Public execution in Dębica (1946)), and by 1947, the resistance movement was crushed. The last Polish cursed soldier, Józef Franczak, was killed in 1963 near Świdnik in northEastern Lesser Poland. Also, all victims of the 1951 Mokotów Prison execution were members of Lesser Poland&#x27;s branch of Freedom and Independence. Another well-known anti-Communist fighter from Lesser Poland is Józef Kuraś, who was active in the southern region of Podhale.

In early 1945, the lands of Lesser Poland were divided between three voivodeships – those of Kraków, Lublin, and Kielce. Since summer 1945, several counties were transferred to neighboring voivodeships – Eastern Lesser Poland (Dębica, Jasło, Mielec) became part of Rzeszów Voivodeship, while western counties of Będzin and Zawiercie were transferred to Katowice Voivodeship. In 1950, the city of Częstochowa became part of Katowice Voivodeship, and next year, the city of Bielsko-Biała was created out of Lesser Poland&#x27;s Biala Krakowska, and Upper Silesia&#x27;s Bielsko. The new city became part of Katowice Voivodeship. Lesser Poland was further divided in 1975, when territorial reform was carried out (see Voivodeships of Poland (1975–1988)). Counties were abolished, and several small voivodeships were created, in such Lesser Poland&#x27;s towns and cities, as Tarnobrzeg, Tarnów, Nowy Sącz, Bielsko-Biała, Radom, Częstochowa, and Siedlce.

The government of Communist Poland invested in heavy industry, following the pre-1939 idea of Central Industrial Area. In Kraków, a new district of Nowa Huta was constructed in the 1950s. In Częstochowa and Zawiercie, the steelworks were significantly expanded, and in early 1970, the government initiated construction of Katowice Steelworks, which, despite its name, is located in Lesser Poland&#x27;s Dąbrowa Górnicza. To connect Katowice Steelworks with Soviet plants, in late 1970s Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line was opened, which crossed Lesser Poland from west to east. Among other major factories, opened in Lesser Poland during Communist rule, there are:
* FSC Lublin, opened in 1951,
* FSC Star in Starachowice, opened in 1948, and based on earlier factory,
* PZL-Świdnik, opened in 1951,
* Zaklady Azotowe Puławy, opened in 1965,
* Połaniec Power Station, opened in 1979,
* Skawina Power Station, opened in 1957,
* Nowiny Cement Plant, opened in 1960,
* Kozienice Power Station, opened in 1973.

Other Lesser Poland&#x27;s major plants were significantly expanded after 1945, including Żywiec Brewery, Okocim Brewery, Fablok, Łucznik Arms Factory, FŁT-Kraśnik, Jaworzno Power Station, Siersza Power Plant, Huta Stalowa Wola, Janina Coal Mine, Sobieski Coal Mine, Zakłady Azotowe Tarnów-Mościce. Furthermore, in early 1950s significant sulfur resources were discovered in Tarnobrzeg, as a result of which Siarkopol company was founded, and the city of Tarnobrzeg quickly grew. In 1975, coal was discovered northeast of Lublin, and soon afterwards, Bogdanka Coal Mine and Piaski Coal Mine were opened.

Between 1971 and 1977, Central Trunk Line was opened, which goes along western boundary of the province, and which connects Kraków and Katowice, with Warsaw. In the early 1980s, construction of a highway between Kraków and Katowice began. The 61-kilometer road is now run by Stalexport Autostrada Małopolska, and is part of A4 highway.

Residents of Lesser Poland frequently protested against Communist government. Major centers of anti-Communist resistance were in Kraków, Nowa Huta, Radom, and Lublin. Among major protests that took place in the province were 1968 Polish political crisis (with Kraków as one of major centers of protests), June 1976 protests (in Radom), Lublin 1980 strikes, 31 August 1982 demonstrations in Poland (in several locations), 1988 Polish strikes (with Stalowa Wola as one of major centers). Several anti-Nazi, and anti-Communist leaders hailed from Lesser Poland: Jan Piwnik, Emil August Fieldorf, Leopold Okulicki, Ryszard Siwiec, Stanisław Pyjas, Hieronim Dekutowski, Andrzej Gwiazda, Andrzej Czuma.

A number of key personalities of Communist government were born in Lesser Poland, including Józef Cyrankiewicz, Bolesław Bierut, Edward Gierek, Wojciech Jaruzelski, Czesław Kiszczak, Stanisław Kania, Hilary Minc, Edward Ochab, Michał Rola-Żymierski, Józef Oleksy.

Among prominent personalities of Polish cultural life of the 20th century, who were born in Lesser Poland, there are: Xawery Dunikowski, Witold Gombrowicz, Gustaw Herling-Grudziński, Sławomir Mrożek, Tadeusz Kantor, Jan Kanty Pawluśkiewicz, Marek Kondrat, Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska, Krzysztof Penderecki, Zbigniew Preisner, Leon Schiller, Jerzy Stuhr, Jan Sztaudynger, Grzegorz Turnau, Jerzy Turowicz.

=== Local Government Reorganization Act (1998) ===



In 1998, the government of Poland carried out administrative reform of the country. For the first time in history, Lesser Poland Voivodeship was created, with its capital in Kraków, and an area of 15,108 square kilometers. The new province covers only a small, southwestern part of historical Lesser Poland.

Today, Lesser Poland is divided between several voivodeships: whole Lesser Poland Voivodeship, whole Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, western half of Lublin Voivodeship, western part of Subcarpathian Voivodeship, eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship, southern part of Mazovian Voivodeship and southeastern corner of Łódź Voivodeship (around Opoczno).

There were suggestions that Lesser Poland Voivodeship should stretch from Bielsko-Biała to Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski and Sandomierz. Furthermore, creation of an Old Poland Voivodeship was proposed, on the historical lands of northern Lesser Poland. Also, since about half of territory of current Silesian Voivodeship belongs to historical Lesser Poland, there are suggestions to rename it into &quot;Silesian – Lesser Poland Voivodeship&quot;.

== Major cities and towns (by size) ==
* Only part in Lesser Poland; ** Historically part of Lesser Poland, since the creation of the Podlaskie Voivodeship in 1816 the area is often referred to as Southern Podlachia.

In the Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, several other locations used to be important urban centers of Lesser Poland, but in the course of the time, their significance declined. The main example is Sandomierz, which for hundreds of years was one of the most important cities of Poland, but now is a town of 25,000. Other examples of historically important places, which are now little towns or villages are:
* Biecz, a town of 5,000, once the seat of a county, incorporated in 1257,
* Chęciny, a village now, once the seat of a county, with a royal castle,
* Czchów, a town of 2,000, incorporated before 1333, once the seat of a county,
* Goraj, a village now, which used to be one of urban centers of Lublin Voivodeship,
* Iłża, a town of 5,000, incorporated before 1294, with a royal castle,
* Kazimierz Dolny, which enjoyed its greatest prosperity in the 16th and the first half of the 17th century,
* Koprzywnica, a village now, a town in 1268–1869,
* Książ Wielki, a town in 1385–1875, once the seat of a county,
* Lelów, a village now, which used to be the seat of a county. Incorporated in 1314, with a royal castle,
* Nowe Miasto Korczyn, a town in 1258–1869, with a royal castle, where general sejmiks of Lesser Poland took place,
* Opatów, a town of 7,000, incorporated in 1282, once the seat of sejmiks,
* Parczew, now a town of 10,000, once a major urban center of northeast Lesser Poland,
* Pilzno, now a town of 4,000, once the seat of a county,
* Sieciechów, a village now, once an important town, incorporated in 1232,
* Stężyca, a village now. Once the seat of a county, which used to be a town in 1330–1869,
* Szczyrzyc, a village now, which used to be the seat of a county,
* Szydłowiec, a town of 12,000, with a royal castle, which in the Renaissance period was an important urban center of northern Lesser Poland,
* Szydłów, a village now, which used to be a major urban center of Sandomierz Voivodeship,
* Urzędów, a village now, which in 1405–1869 used to be a town and the seat of a county,
* Wiślica, a village now, which was probably the capital of the Vistulans, and the seat of a county,
* Wojnicz, now a town of 3,500, incorporated in 1278, used to be the seat of a county,
* Zawichost, a town of 2,000, once a royal town with a castle, incorporated before 1255.

== Economy and industry ==
History of industry in Lesser Poland goes back to prehistoric times, when in Świętokrzyskie Mountains, first bloomeries were constructed. In the Middle Ages, first plants were opened in that area, and as a result, Old-Polish Industrial Region was created, which was a major industrial region of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the 17th century, first Polish blast furnaces were constructed in Samsonów by Italian engineer Hieronim Caccio. Apart from iron products, used for military purposes, Old-Polish Industrial Region also manufactured charcoal and glass. In 1782, in Poland there were 34 bloomeries, out of which 27 were located in Old-Polish Industrial Region. Another major industrial area of Lesser Poland is Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, where in the 16th century, lead, silver, and zinc were found. As early as in the 15th century, coal was extracted in Trzebinia – Siersza, and in the following centuries, especially in the 19th century, several coal mines and steel mills were opened in Zagłębie and in Zagłębie Krakowskie (first coal mine in Jaworzno was opened in 1792). In nearby Olkusz, the history of zinc mining dates to the 12th century when Casimir II the Just set up a mining settlement. Also, in the towns of Wieliczka and Bochnia, salt mines were established in the 12th and 13th centuries (see Bochnia Salt Mine, Wieliczka Salt Mine).

In the 20th century, natural resources were also discovered in central and eastern counties Lesser Poland.
In 1964, the world&#x27;s largest open-pit sulfur mine was opened in Machów near Tarnobrzeg. Other sulfur deposits in the area of Tarnobrzeg are Jeziorko, Grzybów-Gacki, and Grębów-Wydza. The mine at Machów is now closed. In the late 1960s, Eastern Lesser Poland became one of three coal basins of the country, when Lublin Basin was created. Major coal mine in the area is KWK Bogdanka near Łęczna, which is the only coal mine in Poland which has continuously generated a profit. Other Polish coal mines located in Lesser Poland are those found in western part of the province, along the boundary with Upper Silesia – KWK Janina in Jaworzno, KWK Sobieski, and also in Jaworzno. Copper and silver are extracted in Myszków (see Myszków mine).

In the late 1930s, the government of the Second Polish Republic created Central Industrial Region, which was almost exclusively located in Lesser Poland. Currently, within borders of the province, there are following industrial regions:
* &quot;Bielsko Industrial Region&quot; (&quot;Bielski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;), which includes both towns from Lesser Poland, and Upper Silesia (Andrychów, Bielsko-Biała, Cieszyn, Kęty, Pszczyna, Skoczów, Żywiec),
* &quot;Częstochowa Industrial Region&quot; (&quot;Częstochowski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;), which includes Częstochowa, Myszków, and Zawiercie.
* Upper Silesian Industrial Region (&quot;Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;). Despite the name, it also includes cities from Lesser Poland&#x27;s Zagłębie Dąbrowskie – Sosnowiec, Będzin, Czeladź, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Wojkowice,
* &quot;Jaworzno – Chrzanów Industrial Region&quot; (&quot;Jaworznicko-Chrzanowski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;), with the towns of Jaworzno, Chrzanów, Trzebinia, Libiąż, Chełmek, Bukowno, Alwernia, Krzeszowice,
* &quot;Carpathian Industrial Region&quot; (&quot;Karpacki Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;), which stretches from Nowy Sącz, through Jasło and Gorlice, to Sanok,
* &quot;Kraków Industrial Region&quot; (&quot;Krakowski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;) – the city of Kraków and the towns of Wieliczka, Skawina, Myślenice, Bochnia,
* &quot; Lublin Industrial Region&quot; (&quot;Lubelski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;) – the city of Lublin and the towns of Świdnik, Puławy, Łęczna,
* &quot;Tarnobrzeg Industrial Area&quot; (&quot;Tarnobrzeski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;) – Stalowa Wola, Tarnobrzeg, Nisko, Staszów, Janów Lubelski, Gorzyce, Połaniec, Mielec,
* &quot;Tarnów – Rzeszów Industrial Region&quot; (&quot;Tarnowsko-Rzeszowski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;), which stretches from Tarnów to Rzeszów, with such towns, as Dębica, Niedomice, Sędziszów Małopolski, Ropczyce.

In 2009, Polityka weekly made its own list of 500 biggest Polish companies. According to the list, second biggest company of the country was Polska Grupa Energetyczna, which, as Polityka stated, is headquartered in Lublin. Third biggest company of Poland in 2009 was &quot;Fiat Auto Poland&quot; from Bielsko-Biała. Other Lesser Polish companies which ranked high were: &quot;BP Poland&quot; from Kraków (ranked 12th), &quot;Emperia Holding&quot; from Lublin (ranked 26th), Kolporter Holding from Kielce (ranked 43rd), and Żywiec Brewery (ranked 44th). Other major companies of Lesser Poland are &quot;Azoty Tarnów&quot;, Bank BPH, Bogdanka Coal Mine, Carlsberg Polska, Comarch, &quot;Dębica SA&quot;, &quot;Huta Częstochowa&quot;, &quot;Huta Katowice&quot;, Fablok, FŁT-Kraśnik, Huta Stalowa Wola, &quot;Instal-Lublin&quot;, Janina Coal Mine, Jaworzno Power Station, Kozienice Power Station, Łucznik Arms Factory, &quot;Nowiny Cement Plant&quot; near Kielce, Połaniec Power Station, PZL Mielec, PZL-Świdnik, Sobieski Coal Mine, Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks.

Since the lands of historical Lesser Poland belong now to different voivodeships, unemployment rate differs from one region to another. In January 2010, in Poland the unemployment rate was 12,7%. In Silesian Voivodeship, eastern half of which is Lesser Poland, it was 9,9%, in Lesser Poland Voivodeship – 10,5%, in Subcarpathian Voivodeship – 16,3%, in Holy Cross Voivodeship – 15,5%, in Lublin Voivodeship – 13,6%, and in Mazovian Voivodeship (southern part of which is Lesser Poland) – 9,6%. In Lesser Poland&#x27;s cities, the best situation was in Kraków (as for November 2009), where 4,1% had no job. In Bielsko-Biała, the rate was 5,7%, in Lublin – 8,8%, in Siedlce – 9,1%, in Tarnów – 9,2%, in Nowy Sącz – 10%, in Kielce and Częstochowa – 10,1%, in Jaworzno – 10,2%, in Dąbrowa Górnicza – 10,3%, in Sosnowiec – 12,2%, and in Tarnobrzeg – 14,3%. The worst situation on the job market (as for November 2009) was in Radom, where unemployment rate was 20,9% (it made Radom second worst city county of the nation, only after Grudziądz).

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Several European roads (see International E-road network) cross Lesser Poland. The most important one is the European route E40, which goes from west to east, across whole Europe. In Lesser Poland, the E40 goes from Jaworzno, via Kraków and Tarnów, towards eastern border of the country. Another main European road in Lesser Poland is the E77, which goes from north to south, via Radom, Kielce and Kraków, to southern border of Poland at Chyżne. Third major European road in Lesser Poland is the E30, which crosses the territory of the province in its extreme northeast corner, in Siedlce. Apart from these roads, Lesser Poland is crossed by the following European routes:
* E371, which begins in Radom, and goes via Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, Tarnobrzeg, and Rzeszów to the border crossing at Barwinek,
* E372, which begins in Warsaw, and via northEastern Lesser Poland (Lublin, Świdnik), goes to Ukrainian border at Hrebenne,
* E462, which goes through southwestern corner of the province, from Czech border and Bielsko-Biała, to John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice,
* E75, which crosses western counties of Lesser Poland – from Częstochowa, through Dąbrowa Górnicza and Jaworzno, to Bielsko-Biała and Polish – Czech border.

=== Airports ===

Within borders of historical Lesser Poland, there are four airports – John Paul II International Airport Kraków–Balice, Lublin Airport, Warsaw Radom Airport and Katowice International Airport, which is located in the village of Pyrzowice, on the border between Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia. Pyrzowice is part of Gmina Ożarowice, which after Partitions of Poland, and Congress of Vienna belonged to Będzin County of the Russian Empire. In the interbellum, the area of future airport belonged to Lesser Poland&#x27;s Kielce Voivodeship, and in 1945, was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (initially &quot;Silesian-Dąbrowa Voivodeship&quot;). In 1998, Ożarowice, together with the airport, was attached to Tarnowskie Góry County, despite the fact that it is not located in Upper Silesia

Further airports in Lesser Poland will be opened in the future – Kielce – Obice. Also, Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport is located on eastern border of the province.

=== Railroads ===
Railroad network of Lesser Poland is very unevenly distributed. It is very dense in the west, along the border with Upper Silesia, and sparse in the east, especially along the Vistula, and around Lublin. All major cities of the province are connected with each other, however traveling from Kraków to Lublin is time-consuming, as trains have to take an extended route, via Kielce, Radom, and Dęblin. Also, there is no direct connection between Tarnów and Kielce, as these cities belonged to different countries before 1918. Underdevelopment of the railroads in northern and Eastern Lesser Poland is the result of the policy of the Russian Empire. For military reasons, the Russians were not interested in construction of a dense network of lines along the border with Germany and Austria-Hungary, allowing only the construction of narrow-gauge connections. Along the Vistula, between Kraków and Dęblin (the distance of some 320 kilometers), there are only four rail bridges – in Dęblin (rebuilt after the war, in 1947), in Sandomierz (built in 1928), in Tarnobrzeg-Nagnajów (built in 1961, together with a road bridge), and in Zaduszniki (built in 1979 for the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line). In Kraków itself, there are three rail bridges over the Vistula.

Among rail hubs of Lesser Poland, there are Bielsko-Biała, Chabówka, Częstochowa, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Dębica, Dęblin, Jaworzno-Szczakowa, Kalwaria Zebrzydowska Lanckorona, Kielce, Koniecpol, Kozłów, Kraków, Lublin, Łuków, Muszyna, Nowy Sącz, Oświęcim, Siedlce, Spytkowice, Skarżysko-Kamienna, Stalowa Wola, Stróże, Sucha Beskidzka, Radom, Tarnów, Trzebinia, Tunel, Zawiercie, and Żywiec.

In the late 1970s, the Communist government built the broad-gauge Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line, which crosses Lesser Poland from west to east along the Vistula.

== Tourism and nature ==

The historical capital of Lesser Poland – Kraków – is regarded as the cultural capital of Poland, while Zakopane is considered the winter capital of Poland. In 1978, UNESCO placed Kraków&#x27;s Old Town on the list of World Heritage Sites. From Sandomierz to Kraków goes the re-established Lesser Polish Way, one of the routes of the medieval Way of St. James. Every year, hundreds of thousands of tourists come to Lesser Poland, to see its historic cities – Sandomierz, Kazimierz Dolny, Zakopane, Biecz, Opatów, Szydłów, Lublin, and Kraków. Famous Jasna Góra Monastery in Częstochowa, spiritual capital of the country, attracts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, as well as Auschwitz concentration camp (also placed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List). Lesser Poland has many museums, the city of Kraków itself has about sixty of them. Among the most famous are The Czartoryski Museum, The Galicia Jewish Museum, The National Museum, Kraków, Polish Aviation Museum, Sukiennice Museum, and Wawel Castle. There are museums in other locations of the province, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, Bielsko-Biała Museum, Holy Father John Paul II Family Home in Wadowice, &quot;Jacek Malczewski Museum in Radom&quot;, &quot;Lublin Museum&quot;, &quot;Museum of Częstochowa&quot;, &quot;Museum of Sandomierz Diocese&quot;, &quot;Museum of Żywiec Brewery&quot;, &quot;Museum of Zagłębie in Będzin&quot;, Przypkowscy Clock Museum, &quot;Regional Museum in Wiślica&quot;, &quot;Regional Museum in Siedlce&quot;, &quot;Tytus Chałubiński Tatra Museum in Zakopane&quot;.
Among other major places of interest of the province are: Baranów Sandomierski Castle, Będzin Castle, Chęciny Castle, Czarnolas in Zwoleń, Dunajec river castles, Kalwaria Zebrzydowska park (UNESCO World Heritage Sites List), Krzyżtopór, Lipnica Murowana, Lublin Castle, Łysa Góra, Maczuga Herkulesa, Majdanek concentration camp, Niedzica Castle, Ogrodzieniec, Pieskowa Skała, Temple of the Sibyl, Trail of the Eagles&#x27; Nests, Wieliczka Salt Mine (UNESCO World Heritage Sites List), Wooden Churches of Southern Lesser Poland (UNESCO World Heritage Sites List). Furthermore, thousands of tourists come to Radom in northern Lesser Poland, to watch the popular, biannual Radom Air Show. Lesser Poland has a number of open-air museums – &quot;Góra Birów&quot; in Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, &quot;Museum of Kielce Village&quot; in Kielce, &quot;Museum of Lublin Village&quot; in Lublin, &quot;Museum of Folk Culture&quot; in Kolbuszowa, &quot;Museum of Radom Village&quot; in Radom, &quot;Vistula River Etnographic Park&quot; in Babice, &quot;Nowy Sącz Etnographic Park&quot; in Nowy Sącz, &quot;Orawa Etnographic Park&quot; in Zubrzyca Górna, &quot;Chabówka Rolling-Stock Heritage Park&quot; in Chabówka. The Małopolska Institute of Culture, located in Kraków, promotes the activities of regional museums and smaller sites of interest.

Lesser Poland is famous for its underground waters and spas, such as Busko-Zdrój, Solec-Zdrój, Nałęczów, Muszyna, Szczawnica, Piwniczna, Wysowa-Zdrój, Rabka, Swoszowice, Żegiestów, Krzeszowice, Wieliczka, and Krynica-Zdrój. Mountains and resorts of the province make it a major center of Polish tourism – Tatra National Park is visited by around 3 million tourists every year.

The following National Parks are located in Lesser Poland:

== Education ==
=== Universities ===
Lesser Poland is home to Poland&#x27;s oldest university – Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University, which was established in 1364. For centuries, it was the only college of the province, and of the whole country. In December 1918, John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin was opened, becoming second university of Lesser Poland. In 1944, also in Lublin, Maria Curie-Skłodowska University was established.

=== Technical universities ===
There are several technical universities in Lesser Poland – Kraków&#x27;s AGH University of Science and Technology, and University of Technology, as well as University of Bielsko-Biała, Częstochowa University of Technology, Lublin University of Technology, Kazimierz Pułaski Technical University of Radom, and Kielce University of Technology.

=== Other colleges ===
Future teachers may study at Pedagogical University of Cracow, or Jan Długosz University in Częstochowa, and future physicians at Jagiellonian University Medical College, and Medical University of Lublin. Other state colleges are Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Pontifical University of John Paul II in Kraków, Agricultural University of Cracow, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, and Cracow University of Economics. Unique in the country is the Polish Air Force Academy, located in Dęblin. Among private colleges of Lesser Poland, there is Wyższa Szkoła Biznesu – National-Louis University in Nowy Sącz.

== Regional identity and culture ==
Since Lesser Poland ceased to exist as a unified region in the late 18th century, during the Partitions of Poland, most of its inhabitants are not aware of their heritage. Even the residents of Jaworzno, a city which for centuries belonged to Kraków Land and only in 1975 was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (see Voivodeships of Poland (1975–98)), are not familiar with their Lesser Polish roots. In a poll in April 2011, 57% of Jaworzno&#x27;s inhabitants stated that their city is historically tied with Lesser Poland, but as many as 36% said their city is tied with Upper Silesia. Polish linguist Jan Miodek emphasizes the fact that linguistically, Będzin is closer to Myślenice than to Tarnowskie Góry, only 20 km away. Miodek wrote that even though Upper Silesia and Lesser Poland&#x27;s Zagłębie Dąbrowskie are industrially and administratively tied, both regions are culturally and linguistically different from each other. Residents of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie are known for their dislike of Upper Silesians, whom they call &quot;hanysy&quot;, while the Silesians call them &quot;gorole&quot;. In recent years, more inhabitants of Zagłębie become aware of their Lesser Poland&#x27;s heritage, Also, after Partitions of Poland, when Austrian province of Galicia was created, the cities of Rzeszów and Przemyśl, which are part of historical Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities, became associated with Lesser Poland. Therefore, currently the notion of Lesser Poland most commonly applies to the two voivodeships which in the past belonged to Austrian Empire – Lesser Poland Voivodeship, and Subcarpathian Voivodeship

Among several Lesser Poland&#x27;s regional organizations, one of the most important is &quot;Stowarzyszenie Gmin i Powiatów Małopolski&quot; (&quot;The Association of Villages and Counties of Lesser Poland&quot;). It publishes a magazine called &quot;Wspólnota Małopolska&quot; (&quot;Lesser Polish Community&quot;), and every year it chooses a &quot;Lesser Polish Person of the Year&quot; (among winners are John Paul II, Anna Dymna, and Stanisław Dziwisz). &quot;The Association of Villages and Counties of Lesser Poland&quot; has over 120 members from four Polish voivodeships. Among members are cities of Kraków, Częstochowa, Bielsko-Biała, Tarnów, and Przemyśl.

Arguably, the most famous product of Lesser Polish cuisine is the bagel, which was invented in Kraków. Other famous food specialties of the province are oscypek (EU Protected Geographical Status), slivovitz from the village of Łącko, bublik, papal cream cake from Wadowice, Lisiecka Sausage (EU Protected Geographical Status), and Bryndza Podhalańska. Among other popular products that are made in Lesser Poland, there are beers (Browary Lubelskie, Żywiec Beer, and Okocim Beer), pastas and snacks from Lublin&#x27;s Lubella, Kielce Mayonnaise, coffee substitute beverage INKA from Skawina, chocolates from Kraków&#x27;s Wawel Factory, juices from Tymbark, vodka Żołądkowa Gorzka produced in Lublin, and Chopin produced in Siedlce.

Folk costumes from Lesser Poland are widely known across the country – a dancing couple, dressed in traditional Kraków costume (Krakowiacy), is presented on the logo of renowned Żywiec beer, and Podhale is one of few Polish regions, where people regularly wear their traditional costumes. Both Kraków and Podhale folk costumes are among most popular garbs in Poland. Other folk costumes from the region are those of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, Sandomierz, Rzeszów, Częstochowa, Kielce, Radom (regarded as the most traditional of all Polish costumes), Opoczno, Holy Cross Mountains, Nowy Sącz, and Lublin.

== Lesser Polish dialect of Polish ==

Lesser Polish dialect is spoken in southeastern corner of Poland, both in lands which belong to historical Lesser Poland, and in areas which are not part of the province (around Sieradz and Łęczyca). On the other hand, as seen on the map, the Lesser Polish dialect is not spoken in the extreme northeast of Lesser Poland, in Siedlce and vicinity, where people rather speak Masovian dialect. Descending from the language of the Vistulans, it is the most numerous dialectal group in modern Poland. According to Wincenty Pol, it is divided into three subdivisions: Sandomierz dialect, Lublin dialect, and Sanok dialect.

In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Lesser Polish dialect, together with Greater Polish dialect, contributed to creation of standard Polish, it also greatly influenced Silesian (see Dialects of Polish), as well as dialects of Polish used in southern part of Kresy Wschodnie. Later on, however, its importance diminished and was replaced by Masovian dialect, which became the leading dialect of Polish. After Partitions of Poland, when Lesser Poland was divided between Austria and Russia, northern areas of the province took over many features of the Masovian dialect, while Lesser Polish dialect in Austrian province of Galicia was heavily influenced by German.

According to Multimedia Guide to Polish Dialects, a webpage maintained by University of Warsaw, Lesser Polish dialect is divided into the following subdialects:
* Mazowsze Borderland (Pogranicze Mazowsza – around Radom and Dęblin),
* Łęczyca (around Łódź, Kutno, Tomaszów Mazowiecki – this part of the country is not historical Lesser Poland),
* Kielce (around Kielce),
* Lasowiacy (north of Rzeszów),
* East Kraków,
* West Lublin,
* East Lublin (this area historically belongs to Chełm Land),
* Przemyśl (historical part of Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities),
* Biecz,
* Nowy Sącz,
* Podhale,
* Spisz,
* Orawa,
* Żywiec,
* Sieradz,
* Sanok region, or Red-Ruthenian
* Kraków, together with Zagłebie Dąbrowskie.

<text>Long-Term Capital Management L.P. (LTCM) was a highly leveraged hedge fund. In 1998, it received a $3.6 billion bailout from a group of 14 banks, in a deal brokered and put together by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

LTCM was founded in 1994 by John Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM&#x27;s board of directors included Myron Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who three years later in 1997 shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for having developed the Black–Scholes model of financial dynamics.

LTCM was initially successful, with annualized returns (after fees) of around 21% in its first year, 43% in its second year and 41% in its third year. However, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months due to a combination of high leverage and exposure to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and 1998 Russian financial crisis. The master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed soon thereafter, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998, among 14 financial institutions for a $3.65 billion recapitalization under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. The fund was liquidated and dissolved in early 2000.

== Founding ==

John Meriwether headed Salomon Brothers&#x27; bond arbitrage desk until he resigned in 1991 amid a trading scandal. According to Chi-fu Huang, later a Principal at LTCM, the bond arbitrage group was responsible for 80–100% of Salomon&#x27;s global total earnings from the late 1980s until the early 1990s.

In 1993 Meriwether created Long-Term Capital as a hedge fund and recruited several Salomon bond traders; Larry Hilibrand and Victor Haghani in particular would wield substantial clout and two future winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize, Myron Scholes and Robert C. Merton. Other principals included Eric Rosenfeld, Greg Hawkins, William Krasker, Dick Leahy, James McEntee, Robert Shustak, and David W. Mullins Jr.

The company consisted of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a Delaware-incorporated company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. LTCM managed trades in Long-Term Capital Portfolio LP, a partnership registered in the Cayman Islands. The fund&#x27;s operation was designed to have extremely low overhead; trades were conducted through a partnership with Bear Stearns and client relations were handled by Merrill Lynch.

Meriwether chose to start a hedge fund to avoid the financial regulation imposed on more traditional investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, as established by the Investment Company Act of 1940 – funds which accepted stakes from 100 or fewer individuals each with more than $1 million in net worth were exempt from most of the regulations that bound other investment companies. The bulk of the money raised, in late 1993, came from companies and individuals connected to the financial industry. With the help of Merrill Lynch, LTCM also secured hundreds of millions of dollars from high-net-worth individual including business owners and celebrities, as well as private university endowments and later the Italian central bank. By 24 February 1994, the day LTCM began trading, the company had amassed just over $1.01 billion in capital.
== Trading strategies ==
The main strategy was to find pairs of bonds which should have a predictable spread between their prices, and then when this spread widened further to basically place a bet that the two prices would come back towards each other.

The core investment strategy of the company was then known as involving convergence trading: using quantitative models to exploit deviations from fair value in the relationships between liquid securities across nations, and between asset classes (i.e. Fed model-type strategies). In fixed income the company was involved in US Treasuries, Japanese Government Bonds, UK Gilts, Italian BTPs, and Latin American debt, although their activities were not confined to these markets or to government bonds. LTCM was the brightest star on Wall Street at that time.

=== Fixed income arbitrage ===

Fixed income securities pay a set of coupons at specified dates in the future, and make a defined redemption payment at maturity. Since bonds of similar maturities and the same credit quality are close substitutes for investors, there tends to be a close relationship between their prices (and yields). Whereas it is possible to construct a single set of valuation curves for derivative instruments based on LIBOR-type fixings, it is not possible to do so for government bond securities because every bond has slightly different characteristics. It is therefore necessary to construct a theoretical model of what the relationships between different but closely related fixed income securities should be.

For example, the most recently issued treasury bond in the US – known as the benchmark – will be more liquid than bonds of similar but slightly shorter maturity that were issued previously. Trading is concentrated in the benchmark bond, and transaction costs are lower for buying or selling it. As a consequence, it tends to trade more expensively than less liquid older bonds, but this expensiveness (or richness) tends to have a limited duration, because after a certain time there will be a new benchmark, and trading will shift to this security newly issued by the Treasury. One core trade in the LTCM strategies was to purchase the old benchmark – now a 29.75-year bond, and which no longer had a significant premium – and to sell short the newly issued benchmark 30-year, which traded at a premium. Over time the valuations of the two bonds would tend to converge as the richness of the benchmark faded once a new benchmark was issued. If the coupons of the two bonds were similar, then this trade would create an exposure to changes in the shape of the typically upward sloping yield curve: a flattening would depress the yields and raise the prices of longer-dated bonds, and raise the yields and depress the prices of shorter-dated bonds. It would therefore tend to create losses by making the 30-year bond that LTCM was short more expensive (and the 29.75-year bond they owned cheaper) even if there had been no change in the true relative valuation of the securities. This exposure to the shape of the yield curve could be managed at a portfolio level, and hedged out by entering a smaller steepener in other similar securities.

=== Leverage and portfolio composition ===

Because the magnitude of discrepancies in valuations in this kind of trade is small (for the benchmark Treasury convergence trade, typically a few basis points), in order to earn significant returns for investors, LTCM used leverage to create a portfolio that was a significant multiple (varying over time depending on their portfolio composition) of investors&#x27; equity in the fund. It was also necessary to access the financing market in order to borrow the securities that they had sold short. In order to maintain their portfolio, LTCM was therefore dependent on the willingness of its counterparties in the government bond (repo) market to continue to finance their portfolio. If the company were unable to extend its financing agreements, then it would be forced to sell the securities it owned and to buy back the securities it was short at market prices, regardless of whether these were favorable from a valuation perspective.

At the beginning of 1998, the firm had equity of $4.7 billion and had borrowed over $124.5 billion with assets of around $129 billion, for a debt-to-equity ratio of over 25 to 1. It had off-balance sheet derivative positions with a notional value of approximately $1.25 trillion, most of which were in interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps. The fund also invested in other derivatives such as equity options.

John Quiggin&#x27;s book &quot;Zombie Economics&quot; (2010) states, &quot;These derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, were developed with the supposed goal of allowing firms to manage risk on exchange rates and interest rate movements. Instead, they allowed speculation on an unparalleled scale.&quot;

===Secret and opaque operations===

LTCM was open about its overall strategy, but very secretive about its specific operations, including scattering trades among banks. And in perhaps a disconcerting note, &quot;since Long-Term was flourishing, no one needed to know exactly what they were doing. All they knew was that the profits were coming in as promised,&quot; or at least perhaps what should have been a disconcerting note when looked at in hindsight.

Opaqueness may have made even more of a difference and investors may have had even a harder time judging the risk involved when LTCM moved from bond arbitrage into arbitrage involving common stocks and corporate mergers.

=== UBS investment ===

Under prevailing US tax laws, there was a different treatment of long-term capital gains, which were taxed at 20.0 percent, and income, which was taxed at 39.6 percent. The earnings for partners in a hedge fund was taxed at the higher rate applying to income, and LTCM applied its financial engineering expertise to legally transform income into capital gains. It did so by engaging in a transaction with UBS (Union Bank of Switzerland) that would defer foreign interest income for seven years, thereby being able to earn the more favorable capital gains treatment. LTCM purchased a call option on 1 million of their own shares (valued then at $800 million) for a premium paid to UBS of $300 million. This transaction was completed in three tranches: in June, August, and October 1997. Under the terms of the deal, UBS agreed to reinvest the $300 million premium directly back into LTCM for a minimum of three years. In order to hedge its exposure from being short the call option, UBS also purchased 1 million of LTCM shares. Put-call parity means that being short a call and long the same amount of notional as underlying the call is equivalent to being short a put. So the net effect of the transaction was for UBS to lend $300 million to LTCM at LIBOR+50 and to be short a put on 1 million shares. UBS&#x27;s own motivation for the trade was to be able to invest in LTCM – a possibility that was not open to investors generally – and to become closer to LTCM as a client. LTCM quickly became the largest client of the hedge fund desk, generating $15 million in fees annually.

=== Diminishing opportunities and broadening of strategies ===

LTCM attempted to create a splinter fund in 1996 called LTCM-X that would invest in even higher risk trades and focus on Latin American markets. LTCM turned to UBS to invest in and write the warrant for this new spin-off company.

LTCM faced challenges in deploying capital as their capital base grew due to initially strong returns, and as the magnitude of anomalies in market pricing diminished over time. James Surowiecki concludes that LTCM grew such a large portion of such illiquid markets that there was no diversity in buyers in them, or no buyers at all, so the wisdom of the market did not function and it was impossible to determine a price for its assets (such as Danish bonds in September 1998).

In Q4 1997, a year in which it earned 27%, LTCM returned capital to investors. It also broadened its strategies to include new approaches in markets outside of fixed income: many of these were not market neutral – they were dependent on overall interest rates or stock prices going up (or down) – and they were not traditional convergence trades. By 1998, LTCM had accumulated extremely large positions in areas such as merger arbitrage (betting on differences between a proprietary view of the likelihood of success of mergers and other corporate transactions would be completed and the implied market pricing) and S&amp;P 500 options (net short long-term S&amp;P volatility). LTCM had become a major supplier of S&amp;P 500 vega, which had been in demand by companies seeking to essentially insure equities against future declines.

==Early skepticism==
Despite the fund&#x27;s prominent leadership and strong growth at LTCM, there were skeptics from the very beginning. Investor Seth Klarman believed it was reckless to have the combination of high leverage and not accounting for rare or outlying scenarios. Software designer Mitch Kapor, who had sold a statistical program with LTCM partner Eric Rosenfeld, saw quantitative finance as a faith, rather than science. Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Samuelson was concerned about extraordinary events affecting the market. Economist Eugene Fama found in his research that stocks were bound to have extreme outliers. Furthermore, he believed that, because they are subject to discontinuous price changes, real-life markets are inherently more risky than models. Fama became even more concerned when LTCM began adding stocks to their bond portfolio.

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger were two of the individual investors that Meriwether approached in 1993 to invest in the fund. Both analyzed the company but turned down the offer, considering the leverage plan to be too risky.

== Downturn ==

===Riskier investments starting in 1997===

LTCM&#x27;s profit percentage for 1996 was 40%. However, for 1997, it was &quot;only&quot; 17%, which was actually right at average for hedge funds. A big reason was that other companies were by now following LTCM&#x27;s example; greater competition left fewer arbitrage opportunities for LTCM themselves.

As a result, LTCM began investing in emerging-market debt and foreign currencies. Some of the major partners, particularly Myron Scholes, had their doubts about these new investments. For example, when LTCM took a major position in the Norwegian krone, Scholes warned that they had no &quot;informational advantage&quot; in this area.

In June 1998 – which was before the Russian financial crisis – LTCM posted a 10% loss, which was their biggest monthly loss to date.

===1997 Asian financial crisis===

Although 1997 had been a very profitable year for LTCM (17%), the lingering effects of the 1997 Asian crisis continued to shape developments in asset markets into 1998. Despite the crisis originating in Asia, its effects were not confined to that region. The rise in risk aversion had raised concerns amongst investors regarding all markets heavily dependent on international capital flows, and this shaped asset pricing in markets outside Asia too.

===1998 Russian financial crisis===

Although periods of distress have often created tremendous opportunities for relative value strategies, this did not prove to be the case on this occasion, and the seeds of LTCM&#x27;s demise were sown before the Russian default of 17 August 1998. LTCM had returned $2.7 bn to investors in Q4 of 1997, although it had also raised a total in capital of $1.066 bn from UBS and $133 m from CSFB. Since position sizes had not been reduced, the net effect was to raise the leverage of the fund.

In May and June 1998, returns from the fund were -6.42% and -10.14% respectively, reducing LTCM&#x27;s capital by $461 million. This was further aggravated by the exit of Salomon Brothers from the arbitrage business in July 1998. Because the Salomon arbitrage group (where many of LTCM&#x27;s strategies had first been incubated) had been a significant player in the kinds of strategies also pursued by LTCM, the liquidation of the Salomon portfolio (and its announcement itself) had the effect of depressing the prices of the securities owned by LTCM and bidding up the prices of the securities LTCM was short. According to Michael Lewis in the New York Times article of July 1998, returns that month were circa -10%. One LTCM partner commented that because there was a clear temporary reason to explain the widening of arbitrage spreads, at the time it gave them more conviction that these trades would eventually return to fair value (as they did, but not without widening much further first).

Such losses were accentuated through the 1998 Russian financial crisis in August and September 1998, when the Russian government defaulted on its domestic local currency bonds. This came as a surprise to many investors because according to traditional economic thinking of the time, a sovereign issuer should never need to default given access to the printing press. There was a flight to quality, bidding up the prices of the most liquid and benchmark securities that LTCM was short, and depressing the price of the less liquid securities it owned. This phenomenon occurred not merely in the US Treasury market but across the full spectrum of financial assets. Although LTCM was diversified, the nature of its strategy implied an exposure to a latent factor risk of the price of liquidity across markets. As a consequence, when a much larger flight to liquidity occurred than had been anticipated when constructing its portfolio, its positions designed to profit from convergence to fair value incurred large losses as expensive but liquid securities became more expensive, and cheap but illiquid securities became cheaper. By the end of August, the fund had lost $1.85 billion in capital.

Because LTCM was not the only fund pursuing such a strategy, and because the proprietary trading desks of the banks also held some similar trades, the divergence from fair value was made worse as these other positions were also liquidated. As rumors of LTCM&#x27;s difficulties spread, some market participants positioned in anticipation of a forced liquidation. Victor Haghani, a partner at LTCM, said about this time &quot;it was as if there was someone out there with our exact portfolio... only it was three times as large as ours, and they were liquidating all at once.&quot;

Because these losses reduced the capital base of LTCM, and its ability to maintain the magnitude of its existing portfolio, LTCM was forced to liquidate a number of its positions at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer further losses. A vivid illustration of the consequences of these forced liquidations is given by Lowenstein (2000). He reports that LTCM established an arbitrage position in the dual-listed company (DLC) Royal Dutch Shell in the summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an 8%–10% premium relative to Shell. In total $2.3 billion was invested, half of which was &quot;long&quot; in Shell and the other half was &quot;short&quot; in Royal Dutch. LTCM was essentially betting that the share prices of Royal Dutch and Shell would converge because in their belief the present value of the future cashflows of the two securities should be similar. This might have happened in the long run, but due to its losses on other positions, LTCM had to unwind its position in Royal Dutch Shell. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22%, which implies that LTCM incurred a large loss on this arbitrage strategy. LTCM lost $286 million in equity pairs trading and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the Royal Dutch Shell trade.

The company, which had historically earned annualized compounded returns of almost 40% up to this point, experienced a flight to liquidity. In the first three weeks of September, LTCM&#x27;s equity tumbled from $2.3 billion at the start of the month to just $400 million by September 25. With liabilities still over $100 billion, this translated to an effective leverage ratio of more than 250-to-1.

== 1998 bailout ==
Long-Term Capital Management did business with nearly every important person on Wall Street. Indeed, much of LTCM&#x27;s capital was composed of funds from the same financial professionals with whom it traded. As LTCM teetered, Wall Street feared that Long-Term&#x27;s failure could cause a chain reaction in numerous markets, causing catastrophic losses throughout the financial system.

After LTCM failed to raise more money on its own, it became clear it was running out of options. On September 23, 1998, Goldman Sachs, AIG, and Berkshire Hathaway offered then to buy out the fund&#x27;s partners for $250 million, to inject $3.75 billion and to operate LTCM within Goldman&#x27;s own trading division. The offer of $250 million was stunningly low to LTCM&#x27;s partners because at the start of the year their firm had been worth $4.7 billion. Warren Buffett gave Meriwether less than one hour to accept the deal; the time lapsed before a deal could be worked out.

Seeing no options left, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of $3.625 billion by the major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. The principal negotiator for LTCM was general counsel James G. Rickards. The contributions from the various institutions were as follows:
* $300 million: Bankers Trust, Barclays, Chase, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, J.P.Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney, UBS
* $125 million: Société Générale
* $100 million: Paribas and Lehman Brothers
* Bear Stearns and Crédit Agricole declined to participate.

In return, the participating banks got a 90% share in the fund and a promise that a supervisory board would be established. LTCM&#x27;s partners received a 10% stake, still worth about $400 million, but this money was completely consumed by their debts. The partners once had $1.9 billion of their own money invested in LTCM, all of which was wiped out.

The fear was that there would be a chain reaction as the company liquidated its securities to cover its debt, leading to a drop in prices, which would force other companies to liquidate their own debt in a vicious cycle.

The total losses were found to be $4.6 billion. The losses in the major investment categories were (ordered by magnitude):
* $1.6 bn in swaps
* $1.3 bn in equity volatility
* $430 mn in Russia and other emerging markets
* $371 mn in directional trades in developed countries
* $286 mn in Dual-listed company pairs (such as VW, Shell)
* $215 mn in yield curve arbitrage
* $203 mn in S&amp;P 500 stocks
* $100 mn in junk bond arbitrage
* no substantial losses in merger arbitrage

Long-Term Capital was audited by Price Waterhouse LLP. After the bailout by the other investors, the panic abated, and the positions formerly held by LTCM were eventually liquidated at a small profit to the rescuers. Although termed a bailout, the transaction effectively amounted to an orderly liquidation of the positions held by LTCM with creditor involvement and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank. No public money was injected or directly at risk, and the companies involved in providing support to LTCM were also those that stood to lose from its failure. The creditors themselves did not lose money from being involved in the transaction.

Some industry officials said that Federal Reserve Bank of New York involvement in the rescue, however benign, would encourage large financial institutions to assume more risk, in the belief that the Federal Reserve would intervene on their behalf in the event of trouble (see Greenspan put). Federal Reserve Bank of New York actions raised concerns among some market observers that it could create moral hazard since even though the Fed had not directly injected capital, its use of moral suasion to encourage creditor involvement emphasized its interest in supporting the financial system.

LTCM&#x27;s strategies were compared to &quot;picking up nickels in front of a bulldozer&quot; – a likely small gain balanced against a small chance of a large loss, like the payouts from selling an out-of-the-money naked call option. This contrasts with the market efficiency aphorism that there are no $100 bills lying on the street, as someone else has already picked them up.

== Aftermath ==
In 1998, the chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland resigned as a result of a $780 million loss incurred from writing put options on LTCM, which had become significantly in-the-money due to LTCM&#x27;s collapse.

After the bailout, Long-Term Capital Management continued operations. In the year following the bailout, it earned 10%. By early 2000, the fund had been liquidated, and the consortium of banks that financed the bailout had been paid back, but the collapse was devastating for many involved. Mullins, once considered a possible successor to Alan Greenspan, saw his future with the Fed dashed. The theories of Merton and Scholes took a public beating. In its annual reports, Merrill Lynch observed that mathematical risk models &quot;may provide a greater sense of security than warranted; therefore, reliance on these models should be limited.&quot;

After helping unwind LTCM, John Meriwether launched JWM Partners. Haghani, Hilibrand, Leahy, and Rosenfeld signed up as principals of the new firm. By December 1999, they had raised $250 million for a fund that would continue many of LTCM&#x27;s strategies – this time, using less leverage. With the credit crisis of 2008, JWM Partners LLC was hit with a 44% loss from September 2007 to February 2009 in its Relative Value Opportunity II fund. As such, JWM Hedge Fund was shut down in July 2009. Meriwether then launched a third hedge fund in 2010 called JM Advisors Management. A 2014 &quot;Business Insider&quot; article stated that his later two funds used &quot;the same investment strategy from his time at LTCM and Salomon.&quot;

== Analysis ==
Historian Niall Ferguson proposed that LTCM&#x27;s collapse stemmed in part from their use of only five years of financial data to prepare their mathematical models, thus drastically under-estimating the risks of a profound economic crisis:

These ideas were expanded in a 2016 CFA article written by Ron Rimkusk, which pointed out that the VaR model, one of the major quantitative analysis tool by LTCM, had several flaws in it. A VaR model is calculated based on historical data, but the data sample used by LTCM excluded previous economic crises such as those of 1987 and 1994. VaR also could not interpret extreme events such as a financial crisis in terms of timing.
