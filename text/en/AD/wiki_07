<text>Information retrieval (IR) in computing and information science is the task of identifying and retrieving information system resources that are relevant to an information need. The information need can be specified in the form of a search query. In the case of document retrieval, queries can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds.

Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload. An IR system is a software system that provides access to books, journals and other documents; it also stores and manages those documents. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications.

== Overview ==
An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance.

An object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.

Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.

Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.

== History ==

The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article &quot;As We May Think&quot; by Vannevar Bush in 1945. It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a &#x27;statistical machine&#x27; – filed by Emanuel Goldberg in the 1920s and 1930s – that searched for documents stored on film. The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948, detailing an early mention of the Univac computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy &quot;Desk Set&quot;. In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by Gerard Salton at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small text corpora such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents). Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.

In 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cosponsored the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection. This catalyzed research on methods that scale to huge corpora. The introduction of web search engines has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further.

== Model types ==

In order to effectively retrieve relevant documents by IR strategies, the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation. Each retrieval strategy incorporates a specific model for its document representation purposes. The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models. In the picture, the models are categorized according to two dimensions: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model.

=== First dimension: mathematical basis ===
* &quot;Set-theoretic&quot; models represent documents as sets of words or phrases. Similarities are usually derived from set-theoretic operations on those sets. Common models are:
** Standard Boolean model
** Extended Boolean model
** Fuzzy retrieval
* &quot;Algebraic models&quot; represent documents and queries usually as vectors, matrices, or tuples. The similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value.
** Vector space model
** Generalized vector space model
** (Enhanced) Topic-based Vector Space Model
** Extended Boolean model
** Latent semantic indexing a.k.a. latent semantic analysis
* &quot;Probabilistic models&quot; treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference. Similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query. Probabilistic theorems like Bayes&#x27; theorem are often used in these models.
** Binary Independence Model
** Probabilistic relevance model on which is based the okapi (BM25) relevance function
** Uncertain inference
** Language models
** Divergence-from-randomness model
** Latent Dirichlet allocation
* &quot;Feature-based retrieval models&quot; view documents as vectors of values of &quot;feature functions&quot; (or just &quot;features&quot;) and seek the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score, typically by learning to rank methods. Feature functions are arbitrary functions of document and query, and as such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model as just another feature.

=== Second dimension: properties of the model ===
* &quot;Models without term-interdependencies&quot; treat different terms/words as independent. This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the orthogonality assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an independency assumption for term variables.
* &quot;Models with immanent term interdependencies&quot; allow a representation of interdependencies between terms. However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself. It is usually directly or indirectly derived (e.g. by dimensional reduction) from the co-occurrence of those terms in the whole set of documents.
* &quot;Models with transcendent term interdependencies&quot; allow a representation of interdependencies between terms, but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined. They rely on an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms. (For example, a human or sophisticated algorithms.)

== Performance and correctness measures ==

The evaluation of an information retrieval system&#x27; is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users. In general, measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query. Traditional evaluation metrics, designed for Boolean retrieval or top-k retrieval, include precision and recall. All measures assume a ground truth notion of relevance: every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice, queries may be ill-posed and there may be different shades of relevance.

== Libraries for searching and indexing ==
*Lemur
*Lucene
**Solr
**Elasticsearch
*Manatee
*Manticore search
*Sphinx
*Terrier Search Engine
*Xapian

*: 1980: First international ACM SIGIR conference, joint with British Computer Society IR group in Cambridge.
*: 1982: Nicholas J. Belkin, Robert N. Oddy, and Helen M. Brooks proposed the ASK (Anomalous State of Knowledge) viewpoint for information retrieval. This was an important concept, though their automated analysis tool proved ultimately disappointing.
*: 1983: Salton (and Michael J. McGill) published &quot;Introduction to Modern Information Retrieval&quot; (McGraw-Hill), with heavy emphasis on vector models.
*: 1985: David Blair and Bill Maron publish: An Evaluation of Retrieval Effectiveness for a Full-Text Document-Retrieval System
*: mid-1980s: Efforts to develop end-user versions of commercial IR systems.
*:: 1985–1993: Key papers on and experimental systems for visualization interfaces.
*:: Work by Donald B. Crouch, Robert R. Korfhage, Matthew Chalmers, Anselm Spoerri and others.
*: 1989: First World Wide Web proposals by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.
* 1990s
*: 1992: First TREC conference.
*: 1997: Publication of Korfhage&#x27;s &quot;Information Storage and Retrieval&quot; with emphasis on visualization and multi-reference point systems.
*: 1999: Publication of Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto&#x27;s &quot;Modern Information Retrieval&quot; by Addison Wesley, the first book that attempts to cover all IR. 
*: late 1990s: Web search engines implementation of many features formerly found only in experimental IR systems. Search engines become the most common and maybe best instantiation of IR models.

<text>The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was a body of the United Nations that was established to prosecute the war crimes that had been committed during the Yugoslav Wars and to try their perpetrators. The tribunal was an &quot;ad hoc&quot; court located in The Hague, Netherlands.

It was established by Resolution 827 of the United Nations Security Council, which was passed on 25 May 1993. It had jurisdiction over four clusters of crimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991: grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war, genocide, and crimes against humanity. The maximum sentence that it could impose was life imprisonment. Various countries signed agreements with the United Nations to carry out custodial sentences.

A total of 161 persons were indicted; the final indictments were issued in December 2004, the last of which were confirmed and unsealed in the spring of 2005. The final fugitive, Goran Hadžić, was arrested on 20 July 2011. The final judgment was issued on 29 November 2017 and the institution formally ceased to exist on 31 December 2017.

Residual functions of the ICTY, including the oversight of sentences and consideration of any appeal proceedings initiated since 1 July 2013, are under the jurisdiction of a successor body, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT).

== History ==
=== Creation ===

United Nations Security Council Resolution 808 of 22 February 1993 decided that an &quot;international tribunal shall be established for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991&quot;, and called on the Secretary-General to &quot;submit for consideration by the Council ... a report on all aspects of this matter, including specific proposals and where appropriate options ... taking into account suggestions put forward in this regard by Member States&quot;.

The court was originally proposed by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.

Resolution 827 of 25 May 1993 approved the S/25704 report of the secretary-general and adopted the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to it, formally creating the ICTY. It was to have jurisdiction over four clusters of crimes committed on the territory of the former SFR Yugoslavia since 1991:

#Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions
#Violations of the laws or customs of war
#Genocide
#Crime against humanity.

The maximum sentence the ICTY could impose for these crimes was life imprisonment.

=== Implementation ===
In 1993 the internal infrastructure of the ICTY was built. 17 states had signed an agreement with the ICTY to carry out custodial sentences.

1993–1994: In the first year of its existence, the tribunal laid the foundations for its existence as a judicial organ. It established the legal framework for its operations by adopting the rules of procedure and evidence, as well as its rules of detention and directive for the assignment of defence counsel. Together, these rules established a legal aid system for the tribunal. As the ICTY was a part of the United Nations and was the first &quot;international&quot; court for &quot;criminal&quot; justice, the development of a juridical infrastructure was considered quite a challenge. However, after the first year, the first ICTY judges had drafted and adopted all the rules for court proceedings.

1994–1995: The ICTY established its offices within the Aegon Insurance Building in The Hague (which was, at the time, still partially in use by Aegon) and detention facilities in Scheveningen in The Hague (the Netherlands). The ICTY hired many staff members and by July 1994, the Office of the Prosecutor had sufficient staff to begin field investigations. By November 1994, the first indictments were presented to the court and confirmed, and in 1995, the staff numbered over 200 persons from all over the world.

=== Operation ===

In 1994 the first indictment was issued against the Bosnian-Serb concentration camp commander Dragan Nikolić. This was followed on 13 February 1995 by two indictments comprising 21 individuals which were issued against a group of 21 Bosnian-Serbs charged with committing atrocities against Muslim and Croat civilian prisoners. While the war in the former Yugoslavia was still raging, the ICTY prosecutors showed that an international court was viable. However, no accused was arrested.

The court confirmed eight indictments against 46 individuals and issued arrest warrants. Bosnian Serb indictee Duško Tadić became the subject of the tribunal&#x27;s first trial. Tadić was arrested by German police in Munich in 1994 for his alleged actions in the Prijedor region in Bosnia-Herzegovina (especially his actions in the Omarska, Trnopolje and Keraterm detention camps). He made his first appearance before the ICTY Trial Chamber on 26 April 1995, and pleaded not guilty to all of the charges in the indictment.

1995–1996: Between June 1995 and June 1996, 10 public indictments had been confirmed against a total of 33 individuals. Six of the newly indicted persons were transferred in the tribunal&#x27;s detention unit. In addition to Duško Tadic, by June 1996 the tribunal had Tihomir Blaškić, Dražen Erdemović, Zejnil Delalić, Zdravko Mucić, Esad Landžo and Hazim Delić in custody. Erdemović became the first person to enter a guilty plea before the tribunal&#x27;s court. Between 1995 and 1996, the ICTY dealt with miscellaneous cases involving several detainees, which never reached the trial stage.

=== Indictees and accomplishments ===

The tribunal indicted 161 individuals between 1997 and 2004 and completed proceedings with them as follows:
* 111 had trials completed by the ICTY:
** 21 were acquitted by the ICTY:
*** 18 acquittals have stood;
*** 1 was originally acquitted by the ICTY, but convicted on appeal by the IRMCT of one count (and sentenced to time served) 
*** 2 were originally acquitted by the ICTY, but following a successful appeal by the prosecution the acquittals were overturned and a retrial is being conducted by the IRMCT; and 
** 90 were convicted and sentenced by the ICTY:
*** 87 were transferred to 14 different states where they served their prison sentences, had sentences that amounted to time spent in detention during trial, or died after conviction:
**** 20 remain imprisoned;
**** 58 completed their sentences;
**** 9 died while completing their sentences or after conviction awaiting transfer
*** 2 were convicted and sentenced, and remain in IRMCT detention awaiting transfer; and
*** 1 was convicted and sentenced, but has filed an appeal to the IRMCT that is being considered 
* 13 had their cases transferred to courts in:
** Bosnia and Herzegovina (10);
** Croatia (2); and
** Serbia (1)
* 37 had their cases terminated prior to trial completion, because
** the indictments were withdrawn (20); or
** the indictees died before or after transfer to the Tribunal (17).

The indictees ranged from common soldiers to generals and police commanders all the way to prime ministers. Slobodan Milošević was the first sitting head of state indicted for war crimes. Other &quot;high level&quot; indictees included Milan Babić, former president of the Republika Srpska Krajina; Ramush Haradinaj, former Prime Minister of Kosovo; Radovan Karadžić, former President of the Republika Srpska; Ratko Mladić, former Commander of the Bosnian Serb Army; and Ante Gotovina (acquitted), former General of the Croatian Army.

The very first hearing at the ICTY was a referral request in the Tadić case on 8 November 1994. Croat Serb General and former president of the Republic of Serbian Krajina Goran Hadžić was the last fugitive wanted by the tribunal to be arrested on 20 July 2011.

An additional 23 individuals have been the subject of contempt proceedings.

In 2004, the ICTY published a list of five accomplishments &quot;in justice and law&quot;:

# &quot;Spearheading the shift from impunity to accountability&quot;, pointing out that, until very recently, it was the only court judging crimes committed as part of the Yugoslav conflict, since prosecutors in the former Yugoslavia were, as a rule, reluctant to prosecute such crimes;
# &quot;Establishing the facts&quot;, highlighting the extensive evidence-gathering and lengthy findings of fact that tribunal judgments produced;
# &quot;Bringing justice to thousands of victims and giving them a voice&quot;, pointing out the large number of witnesses that had been brought before the tribunal;
# &quot;The accomplishments in international law&quot;, describing the fleshing out of several international criminal law concepts which had not been ruled on since the Nuremberg Trials;
# &quot;Strengthening the Rule of Law&quot;, referring to the tribunal&#x27;s role in promoting the use of international standards in war crimes prosecutions by former Yugoslav republics.

=== Closure ===
The United Nations Security Council passed resolutions 1503 in August 2003 and 1534 in March 2004, which both called for the completion of all cases at both the ICTY and its sister tribunal, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) by 2010.

In December 2010, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1966, which established the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT), a body intended to gradually assume residual functions from both the ICTY and the ICTR as they wound down their mandate. Resolution 1966 called upon the tribunal to finish its work by 31 December 2014 to prepare for its closure and the transfer of its responsibilities.

In a &quot;Completion Strategy Report&quot; issued in May 2011, the ICTY indicated that it aimed to complete all trials by the end of 2012 and complete all appeals by 2015, with the exception of Radovan Karadžić whose trial was expected to end in 2014 and Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić, who were still at large at that time and were not arrested until later that year.

The IRMCT&#x27;s ICTY branch began functioning on 1 July 2013. Per the Transitional Arrangements adopted by the UN Security Council, the ICTY was to conduct and complete all outstanding first-instance trials, including those of Karadžić, Mladić and Hadžić. The ICTY would also conduct and complete all appeal proceedings for which the notice of appeal against the judgement or sentence was filed before 1 July 2013. The IRMCT will handle any appeals for which notice is filed after that date.

The final ICTY trial to be completed in the first instance was that of Ratko Mladić, who was convicted on 22 November 2017. The final case to be considered by the ICTY was an appeal proceeding encompassing six individuals, whose sentences were upheld on 29 November 2017.

== Organization ==
While operating, the tribunal employed around 900 staff. Its organisational components were Chambers, Registry and the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP).
=== Prosecutors ===
The Prosecutor was responsible for investigating crimes, gathering evidence and prosecutions and was head of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP). The Prosecutor was appointed by the UN Security Council upon nomination by the UN secretary-general.

The last prosecutor was Serge Brammertz. Previous Prosecutors have been Ramón Escovar Salom of Venezuela (1993–1994), however, he never took up that office, Richard Goldstone of South Africa (1994–1996), Louise Arbour of Canada (1996–1999), and Carla Del Ponte of Switzerland (1999–2007). Richard Goldstone, Louise Arbour and Carla Del Ponte also simultaneously served as the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda until 2003. Graham Blewitt of Australia served as the Deputy Prosecutor from 1994 until 2004. David Tolbert, the president of the International Center for Transitional Justice, was also appointed Deputy Prosecutor of the ICTY in 2004.

=== Chambers ===
Chambers encompassed the judges and their aides. The tribunal operated three Trial Chambers and one Appeals Chamber. The president of the tribunal was also the presiding judge of the Appeals Chamber.

At the time of the court&#x27;s dissolution, there were seven permanent judges and one &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge who served on the tribunal. A total of 86 judges have been appointed to the tribunal from 52 United Nations member states. Of those judges, 51 were permanent judges, 36 were &quot;ad litem&quot; judges, and one was an &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge. Note that one judge served as both a permanent and &quot;ad litem&quot; judge, and another served as both a permanent and &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge.

UN member and observer states could each submit up to two nominees of different nationalities to the UN secretary-general. The UN secretary-general submitted this list to the UN Security Council which selected from 28 to 42 nominees and submitted these nominees to the UN General Assembly. The UN General Assembly then elected 14 judges from that list. Judges served for four years and were eligible for re-election. The UN secretary-general appointed replacements in case of vacancy for the remainder of the term of office concerned.

On 21 October 2015, Judge Carmel Agius of Malta was elected president of the ICTY and Liu Daqun of China was elected vice-president; they assumed their positions on 17 November 2015. Agius&#x27;s predecessors were Antonio Cassese of Italy (1993–1997), Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States (1997–1999), Claude Jorda of France (1999–2002), Theodor Meron of the United States (2002–2005), Fausto Pocar of Italy (2005–2008), Patrick Robinson of Jamaica (2008–2011), and Theodor Meron (2011–2015).

=== Registry ===
The Registry was responsible for handling the administration of the tribunal; activities included keeping court records, translating court documents, transporting and accommodating those who appear to testify, operating the Public Information Section, and such general duties as payroll administration, personnel management and procurement. It was also responsible for the Detention Unit for indictees being held during their trial and the Legal Aid program for indictees who cannot pay for their own defence. It was headed by the Registrar, a position occupied over the years by Theo van Boven of the Netherlands (February 1994 to December 1994), Dorothée de Sampayo Garrido-Nijgh of the Netherlands (1995–2000), Hans Holthuis of the Netherlands (2001–2009), and John Hocking of Australia (May 2009 to December 2017).

=== Detention facilities ===

Those defendants on trial and those who were denied a provisional release were detained at the United Nations Detention Unit on the premises of the Penitentiary Institution Haaglanden, location Scheveningen in Belgisch Park, a suburb of The Hague, located some 3 km by road from the courthouse. The indicted were housed in private cells which had a toilet, shower, radio, satellite TV, personal computer (without internet access) and other luxuries. They were allowed to phone family and friends daily and could have conjugal visits. There was also a library, a gym and various rooms used for religious observances. The inmates were allowed to cook for themselves. All of the inmates mixed freely and were not segregated on the basis of nationality. As the cells were more akin to a university residence instead of a jail, some had derisively referred to the ICT as the &quot;Hague Hilton&quot;. The reason for this luxury relative to other prisons is that the first president of the court wanted to emphasise that the indictees were innocent until proven guilty.

== Controversies ==
Criticisms of the court include:
* Carla Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, said in 2021 that the US did not want the ICTY to scrutinise war crimes committed by the Kosovo Liberation Army. According to her, Madeleine Albright, the United States secretary of state at the time, told her to slow down the investigation of Ramush Haradinaj.
* Michael Mandel, William Blum and others accused the court of having a pro-NATO bias due to its refusal to prosecute NATO officials and politicians for war crimes.
* On 6 December 2006, the Tribunal at The Hague approved the use of force-feeding of Serbian politician Vojislav Šešelj. They decided it was not &quot;torture, inhuman or degrading treatment if there is a medical necessity to do so... and if the manner in which the detainee is force-fed is not inhuman or degrading&quot;.
* Reducing the indictment charges after the arrest of Ratko Mladić, Croatian officials publicly condemned chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz for his announcement that the former Bosnian Serb General would be tried solely for crimes allegedly committed in Bosnia, not in Croatia.
* Critics have questioned whether the tribunal exacerbates tensions rather than promotes reconciliation, as is claimed by tribunal supporters. Polls show a generally negative reaction to the tribunal among both Serbs and Croats. A majority of Serbs and Croats have expressed doubts regarding the ICTY&#x27;s integrity and question the tenability of its legal procedures.
* 68% of indictees have been Serbs (or Montenegrins), to the extent that a sizeable portion of the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb political and military leaderships have been indicted. Many have seen this as reflecting bias, while the tribunal&#x27;s defenders have seen this as indicative of the actual proportion of crimes committed. However, Marko Hoare claimed that, aside from Milošević, only Momčilo Perišić (Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army), who was acquitted, has been indicted from the Serbian military or political top when it comes to wars in Croatia and Bosnia.
* According to Hoare, a former employee at the ICTY, an investigative team worked on indictments of senior members of the &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot;, including not only Milošević but also Veljko Kadijević, Blagoje Adžić, Borisav Jović, Branko Kostić, Momir Bulatović and others. However, Hoare claims that, due to Carla del Ponte&#x27;s intervention, these drafts were rejected, and the indictment limited to Milošević alone.
* There have been allegations of censorship: in July 2011, the Appeals Chamber of ICTY confirmed the judgment of the Trial Chamber which found journalist and former tribunal&#x27;s OTP spokesperson Florence Hartmann guilty of contempt of court and fined her €7,000. She disclosed documents of FR Yugoslavia&#x27;s Supreme Defense Council meetings and criticized the tribunal for granting confidentiality of some information in them to protect Serbia&#x27;s &#x27;vital national interests&#x27; during Bosnia&#x27;s lawsuit against the country for genocide in front of the International Court of Justice. Hartmann argued that Serbia was freed of the charge of genocide because ICTY redacted certain information in the council meetings. Since these documents have in the meantime been made public by the ICTY itself, a group of organizations and individuals, who supported her, said that the tribunal in this appellate proceedings &quot;imposed a form of censorship aimed to protect the international judges from any form of criticism&quot;. (France refused to extradite Hartmann to serve the prison sentence issued against her by the ICTY after she refused to pay the €7,000 fine.)
* Klaus-Peter Willsch compared the Ante Gotovina verdict, in which the late Croatian president Franjo Tuđman was posthumously found to have been participating in a Joint Criminal Enterprise, with the 897 Cadaver Synod trial in Rome, when Pope Stephen VI had the corpse of Pope Formosus exhumed, put on trial and posthumously convicted.
* Some sentences have been considered too mild, even within the tribunal, complained at small sentences of convicted war criminals in comparison with their crimes. In 2010, Veselin Šljivančanin&#x27;s sentence for his involvement in the Vukovar massacre was cut from 17 to 10 years, which caused outrage in Croatia. Upon hearing that news, Vesna Bosanac, who had been in charge of the Vukovar hospital during the fall of the city, said that the &quot;ICTY is dead&quot; for her: &quot;For crimes that he [Šljivančanin], had committed in Vukovar, notably at Ovčara, he should have been jailed for life. I&#x27;m outraged... The Hague(-based) tribunal has showed again that it is not a just tribunal.&quot; Danijel Rehak, the head of Croatian Association of Prisoners in Serbian Concentration Camps, said, &quot;The shock of families whose beloved ones were killed at Ovčara is unimaginable. The court made a crucial mistake by accepting a statement of a JNA officer to whom Šljivančanin was a commander. I cannot understand that&quot;. Pavle Strugar&#x27;s 8-year sentence for shelling of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, also caused outrage in Croatia. Judge Kevin Parker (of Australia) was named in a Croatian journal (Nacional) as a main cause of the system&#x27;s failure for having dismissed the testimonies of numerous witnesses.
* Some of the defendants, such as Slobodan Milošević, claimed that the court has no legal authority because it was established by the UN Security Council instead of the UN General Assembly and so had not been created on a broad international basis. The tribunal was established on the basis of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter; the relevant portion of which reads &quot;the Security Council can take measures to maintain or restore international peace and security&quot;. The legal criticism has been succinctly stated in a memorandum issued by Austrian Professor Hans Köchler, which was submitted to the president of the Security Council in 1999. British Conservative Party MEP Daniel Hannan has called for the court to be abolished, claiming it is anti-democratic and a violation of national sovereignty.
* The interactive thematic debate on the role of international criminal justice in reconciliation was convened on 10 April 2013 by the President of the General Assembly, Vuk Jeremić, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia during the resumed part of the GA&#x27;s 67th Session. The debate was scheduled after the convictions of Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač for inciting war crimes against Serbs in Croatia were overturned by an ICTY Appeals Panel in November 2012. The ICTY president Theodor Meron announced that all three Hague war crimes courts turned down the invitation of UNGA president to participate in the debate about their work. The President of the General Assembly, Jeremić, described Meron&#x27;s refusal to participate in this debate as scandalous. He emphasized that he does not shy away from criticizing the ICTY, which has &quot;convicted nobody for inciting crimes committed against Serbs in Croatia.&quot;. Jeremić, who served as president of the General Assembly in his capacity as Serbian foreign minister, was effectively speaking on behalf of the Serbian government when making such statements and his views do not necessarily reflect those of the UN General Assembly. Tomislav Nikolić, the president of Serbia criticized the ICTY, claiming it did not contribute but hindered reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia. He added that although there is no significant ethnic disproportion among the number of casualties in the Yugoslav wars, the ICTY sentenced Serbs and ethnic Serbs to a combined total of 1150 years in prison while claiming that members of other ethnic groups have been sentenced to a total of 55 years for crimes against Serbs. Vitaly Churkin, the ambassador of Russia to the UN, criticized the work of the ICTY, especially the overturned convictions of Gotovina and Ramush Haradinaj.
* Regarding the final case on 29 November 2017 proceeding encompassing six Bosnian-Croat individuals, one of whom, Slobodan Praljak, in protest in court drank poison and subsequently died, the Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković claimed the verdict was &quot;unjust&quot; and Praljak&#x27;s suicide &quot;speaks of deep moral injustice to the six Croats, from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croat people&quot;. He criticized the verdict because it did not recognize the assistance and support provided by Croatia to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the collaboration of both armies at a time when the neighbouring state was faced with the &quot;Greater-Serbian aggression&quot; and when its territorial integrity was compromised, as well it alludes to the link between the then leadership of the Republic of Croatia, while in the previous verdict to Bosnian-Serb Ratko Mladić does not recognize the connection with Serbia&#x27;s state officials at that time.
* Dutch filmmaker Jos de Putter made a trilogy, The Milosevic Case – Glosses at Trial, for Tegenlicht investigative slot at the VPRO. The main hypothesis of the film is that ICTY prosecution has been struggling and failing to prove any link between Milosevic and the media version of the truth of the bloody break-up of Yugoslavia. The legitimacy of the prosecution methodology in securing the witness accounts and evidence, in general, has been examined by the filmmaker.

<text>ISO 216 is an international standard for paper sizes, used around the world except in North America and parts of Latin America. The standard defines the &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; series of paper sizes, which includes the A4, the most commonly available paper size worldwide. Two supplementary standards, ISO 217 and ISO 269, define related paper sizes; the ISO 269 &quot;C&quot; series is commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes.

All ISO 216, ISO 217 and ISO 269 paper sizes (except some envelopes) have the same aspect ratio, , within rounding to millimetres. This ratio has the unique property that when cut or folded in half widthways, the halves also have the same aspect ratio. Each ISO paper size is one half of the area of the next larger size in the same series.

== Dimensions of A, B and C series ==


== History ==
The oldest known mention of the advantages of basing a paper size on an aspect ratio of formula_1 is found in a letter written on 25 October 1786 by the German scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg to Johann Beckmann, both at the University of Göttingen. Early variants of the formats that would become ISO paper sizes A2, A3, B3, B4, and B5 then evolved in France, where they were listed in a 1798 French law on taxation of publications () that was based in part on page sizes.
Searching for a standard system of paper formats on a scientific basis at the Bridge association (), as a replacement for the vast variety of other paper formats that had been used before, in order to make paper stocking and document reproduction cheaper and more efficient, in 1911 Wilhelm Ostwald proposed, over a hundred years after the 1798 French law, a global standarda world format ()for paper sizes based on the ratio formula_1, referring to the argument advanced by Lichtenberg&#x27;s 1786 letter, but linking this to the metric system using as the width of the base format. argued in a long article published in 1918, that a firm basis for the system of paper formats, which deal with surfaces, ought not be the length but the area; that is, linking the system of paper formats to the metric system using the square metre rather than the centimetre, constrained by formula_3 and area formula_4 square metre, where formula_5 is the length of the shorter side and formula_6 is the length of the longer side, for the second equation both in metres. Porstmann also argued that formats for &quot;containers&quot; of paper, such as envelopes, should be 10% larger than the paper format itself.

In 1921, after a long discussion and another intervention by Porstmann, the Standardisation Committee of German Industry (, or NADI in short), which is the German Institute for Standardisation (, or DIN in short) today, published German standard &quot;DI Norm 476&quot; the specification of four series of paper formats with ratio formula_1, with series A as the always preferred formats and basis for the other series. All measures are rounded to the nearest millimetre. A0 has a surface area of up to a rounding error, with a width of and height of , so an actual area of ; A4 is recommended as standard paper size for business, administrative and government correspondence; and A6 for postcards. Series B is based on B0 with width of , C0 is , and D0 . Series C is the basis for envelope formats.

The DIN paper-format concept was soon introduced as a national standard in many other countries, for example, Belgium (1924), Netherlands (1925), Norway (1926), Switzerland (1929), Sweden (1930), Soviet Union (1934), Hungary (1938), Italy (1939), Finland (1942), Uruguay (1942), Argentina (1943), Brazil (1943), Spain (1947), Austria (1948), Romania (1949), Japan (1951), Denmark (1953), Czechoslovakia (1953), Israel (1954), Portugal (1954), Yugoslavia (1956), India (1957), Poland (1957), United Kingdom (1959), Venezuela (1962), New Zealand (1963), Iceland (1964), Mexico (1965), South Africa (1966), France (1967), Peru (1967), Turkey (1967), Chile (1968), Greece (1970), Zimbabwe (1970), Singapore (1970), Bangladesh (1972), Thailand (1973), Barbados (1973), Australia (1974), Ecuador (1974), Colombia (1975) and Kuwait (1975).

It finally became both an international standard (ISO 216) as well as the official United Nations document format in 1975, and it is today used in almost all countries in the world, with the exception of several countries in the Americas.

In 1977, a large German car manufacturer performed a study of the paper formats found in their incoming mail and concluded that out of 148 examined countries, 88 already used the A series formats.

==Advantages==
The main advantage of this system is its scaling. Rectangular paper with an aspect ratio of formula_1 has the unique property that, when cut in two across the midpoints of the longer sides, each half has the same formula_1 aspect ratio as the whole sheet before it was divided. Equivalently, if one lays two same-sized sheets of paper with an aspect ratio of formula_1 side by side along their longer side, they form a larger rectangle with the aspect ratio of formula_1 and double the area of each individual sheet.

The ISO system of paper sizes exploits these properties of the formula_1 aspect ratio. In each series of sizes (for example, series A), the largest size is numbered 0 (so in this case A0), and each successive size (A1, A2, etc.) has half the area of the preceding sheet and can be cut by halving the length of the preceding size sheet. The new measurement is rounded down to the nearest millimetre. A folded brochure can be made by using a sheet of the next larger size (for example, an A4 sheet is folded in half to make a brochure with size A5 pages). An office photocopier or printer can be designed to reduce a page from A4 to A5 or to enlarge a page from A4 to A3. Similarly, two sheets of A4 can be scaled down to fit one A4 sheet without excess empty paper.

This system also simplifies calculating the weight of paper. Under ISO 536, paper&#x27;s grammage is defined as a sheet&#x27;s mass in grams (g) per area in square metres (unit symbol g/m2; the nonstandard abbreviation &quot;gsm&quot; is also used). One can derive the grammage of other sizes by arithmetic division. A standard A4 sheet made from paper weighs , as it is (four halvings, ignoring rounding) of an A0 page. Thus the weight, and the associated postage rate, can be approximated easily by counting the number of sheets used.

ISO 216 and its related standards were first published between 1975 and 1995:
* ISO 216:2007, defining the A and B series of paper sizes
* ISO 269:1985, defining the C series for envelopes
* ISO 217:2013, defining the RA and SRA series of raw (&quot;untrimmed&quot;) paper sizes

==Properties==
===A series===

Paper in the A series format has an aspect ratio of (≈ 1.414, when rounded). A0 is defined so that it has an area of before rounding to the nearest . Successive paper sizes in the series (A1, A2, A3, etc.) are defined by halving the area of the preceding paper size and rounding down, so that the long side of is the same length as the short side of A&quot;n&quot;. Hence, each next size is nearly exactly half the area of the prior size. So, an A1 page can fit two A2 pages inside the same area.

The most used of this series is the size A4, which is and thus almost exactly in area. For comparison, the letter paper size commonly used in North America () is about () wider and () shorter than A4. Then, the size of A5 paper is half of A4, i.e. × ( × ).

The geometric rationale for using the square root of 2 is to maintain the aspect ratio of each subsequent rectangle after cutting or folding an A-series sheet in half, perpendicular to the larger side. Given a rectangle with a longer side, &quot;x&quot;, and a shorter side, &quot;y&quot;, ensuring that its aspect ratio, , will be the same as that of a rectangle half its size, , which means that , which reduces to ; in other words, an aspect ratio of .

Any paper can be defined as , where (measuring in metres)

:formula_13

Therefore

:formula_14, formula_15 formula_16 Etc.

===B series===
The B series is defined in the standard as follows: &quot;A subsidiary series of sizes is obtained by placing the geometrical means between adjacent sizes of the A series in sequence.&quot; The use of the geometric mean makes each step in size: B0, A0, B1, A1, B2 ... smaller than the previous one by the same factor. As with the A series, the lengths of the B series have the ratio , and folding one in half (and rounding down to the nearest millimetre) gives the next in the series. The shorter side of B0 is exactly 1 metre.

There is also an incompatible Japanese B series which the JIS defines to have 1.5 times the area of the corresponding JIS A series (which is identical to the ISO A series). Thus, the lengths of JIS B series paper are ≈ 1.22 times those of A-series paper. By comparison, the lengths of ISO B series paper are ≈ 1.19 times those of A-series paper.

Any paper (according to the ISO standard) can be defined as , where (measuring in metres)

:formula_17

Therefore

:formula_18, formula_19 formula_20 Etc.

===C series===
The C series formats are geometric means between the B series and A series formats with the same number (e.g. C2 is the geometric mean between B2 and A2). The width to height ratio of C series formats is as in the A and B series. A, B, and C series of paper fit together as part of a geometric progression, with ratio of successive side lengths of , though there is no size half-way between B&quot;n&quot; and : A4, C4, B4, &quot;D4&quot;, A3, ...; there is such a D-series in the Swedish extensions to the system. The lengths of ISO C series paper are therefore ≈ 1.09 times those of A-series paper.

The C series formats are used mainly for envelopes. An unfolded A4 page will fit into a C4 envelope. Due to same width to height ratio, if an A4 page is folded in half so that it is A5 in size, it will fit into a C5 envelope (which will be the same size as a C4 envelope folded in half).

Any paper can be defined as , where (measuring in metres)

:formula_21

Therefore

:formula_22, formula_23 formula_24 Etc.

==Tolerances==
The tolerances specified in the standard are:
* ±1.5 mm for dimensions up to 150 mm,
* ±2.0 mm for dimensions in the range 150 to 600 mm, and
* ±3.0 mm for dimensions above 600 mm.

These are related to comparison between series A, B and C.

==Application==

The ISO 216 formats are organized around the ratio 1:; two sheets next to each other together have the same ratio, sideways. In scaled photocopying, for example, two A4 sheets reduced to A5 size fit exactly onto one A4 sheet, and an A4 sheet in magnified size onto an A3 sheet; in each case, there is neither waste nor want.

The principal countries not generally using the ISO paper sizes are the United States and Canada, which use North American paper sizes. Although they have also officially adopted the ISO 216 paper format, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Colombia, the Philippines, and Chile also use mostly U.S. paper sizes.

Rectangular sheets of paper with the ratio 1: are popular in paper folding, such as origami, where they are sometimes called &quot;A4 rectangles&quot; or &quot;silver rectangles&quot;. In other contexts, the term &quot;silver rectangle&quot; can also refer to a rectangle in the proportion 1:(1 + ), known as the silver ratio.

==Matching technical pen widths==

An adjunct to the ISO paper sizes, particularly the A series, are the technical drawing line widths specified in ISO 128. For example, line type A (&quot;Continuous - thick&quot;, used for &quot;visible outlines&quot;) has a standard thickness of 0.7 mm on an A0-sized sheet, 0.5 mm on an A1 sheet, and 0.35 mm on A2, A3, or A4.

The matching technical pen widths are 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.40, and 2.0 mm, as specified in ISO 9175-1. Colour codes are assigned to each size to facilitate easy recognition by the drafter. Like the paper sizes, these pen widths increase by a factor of , so that particular pens can be used on particular sizes of paper, and then the next smaller or larger size can be used to continue the drawing after it has been reduced or enlarged, respectively.

 The earlier DIN 6775 standard upon which ISO 9175-1 is based also specified a term and symbol for easy identification of pens and drawing templates compatible with the standard, called &quot;Micronorm&quot;, which may still be found on some technical drafting equipment.

==Overformats==
DIN 476 provides for formats larger than A0, denoted by a prefix factor. In particular, it lists the formats 2A0 and 4A0, which are twice and four times the size of A0 respectively:

While not formally defined, ISO 216:2007 notes them in the table of &quot;Main series of trimmed sizes&quot; (ISO A series) as well: &quot;The rarely used sizes [2A0 and 4A0] which follow also belong to this series.&quot; 2A0 is also known by other unofficial names like &quot;A00&quot;.

<text>ISO 3864 is an International Organization for Standardization technical standard for safety signs and markings in workplaces and public facilities. These labels are graphical, to overcome language barriers. The standard is split into four parts.

==Parts==
ISO 3864 consists of four parts, that provide more specific and situation specific guidance depending on the application.
* ISO 3864-1:2011 Part 1: Design principles for safety signs and safety markings
* ISO 3864-2:2016 Part 2: Design principles for product safety labels
* ISO 3864-3:2012 Part 3: Design principles for graphical symbols for use in safety signs
* ISO 3864-4:2011 Part 4: Colorimetric and photometric properties of safety sign materials

Part 1 explains how to layout the components of safety signage, dictate the color scheme and sizing information. Part 2 covers the same concepts as part one, but specifically for labels applied on machinery, vehicles and consumer goods. Part 3 contains guidance for designing new safety symbols. Part 4 specifies the standards for phosphorescent material and colours of a sign, as well as testing to confirm these signs meets required standards.

== Components of ISO 3864 ==

=== Colours ===
These are the colours specified in ISO Standard 3864-4 in RAL colour standard.
In addition, ISO standard 3864-2:2016 lays out the following colours that correspond to levels of risk. This standard adds &quot;Orange&quot; as an incremental colour to the pallette above.

===Arrows===
ISO 3864-3 defines four types of arrow designs, and specifies what situations each type should be used in.
===Safety markings===
Part 1 also provides design standards for &#x27;safety markings&#x27;, which are safety colors combined with a contrasting color in an alternating 45° stripe pattern, intended to increase the visibility of an object, location or safety message.
===Signage design===
In addition to prescribing colours for safety signage, ISO 3864 also specifies how to layout the elements of the sign: A symbol and optional &#x27;supplemental sign&#x27; which contains the supplementary text message.
====Multi-message signs====
For situations where more than one message needs to be communicated, ISO 3864 also provides guidance for &quot;multiple signs&quot;, which consist of two or more symbol and text messages combined into a single sign. Additionally, fire protection and safe condition signs, which mark the location of equipment or exits can be combined with an arrow to indicate the direction to the item depicted on the sign.
==Related standards==
The corresponding American standard is ANSI Z535. ANSI Z535.1 also explicitly uses multiple levels of hazard, including Yellow (Pantone 109) for &#x27;caution&#x27; messages, and Orange (Pantone 151) for stronger &#x27;warning&#x27; messages. Like ISO 3864, ANSI Z535 includes multiple sections: ANSI Z535.6-2006 defines an optional accompanying text in one or more languages.

ISO 3864 is extended by ISO 7010, which provides a set of symbols based on the principles and properties specified in ISO 3864.

<text>Isaac Abendana (–1699) was the younger brother of Jacob Abendana, and became &quot;hakam&quot; of the Spanish Portuguese Synagogue in London after his brother died.

Abendana moved to England before his brother, in 1662, and taught Hebrew at Cambridge University. He completed an unpublished Latin translation of the &quot;Mishnah&quot; for the university in 1671.

While he was at Cambridge, Abendana sold Hebrew books to the Bodleian Library of Oxford, and in 1689 he took a teaching position in Magdalen College. In Oxford, he wrote a series of Jewish almanacs for Christians, which he later collected and compiled as the &quot;Discourses on the Ecclesiastical and Civil Polity of the Jews&quot; (1706). Like his brother, he maintained an extensive correspondence with leading Christian scholars of his time, most notably with the philosopher Ralph Cudworth, master of Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

<doc id="15285" wikidata="Q217082" url="?curid=15285" title="Internet Engineering Task Force">
<text>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a standards organization for the Internet and is responsible for the technical standards that make up the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP). It has no formal membership roster or requirements and all its participants are volunteers. Their work is usually funded by employers or other sponsors.

The IETF was initially supported by the federal government of the United States but since 1993 has operated under the auspices of the Internet Society, a non-profit organization with local chapters around the world.

==Organization==
There is no membership in the IETF. Anyone can participate by signing up to a working group mailing list, or registering for an IETF meeting.

The IETF operates in a bottom-up task creation mode, largely driven by working groups. Each working group normally has appointed two co-chairs (occasionally three); a charter that describes its focus; and what it is expected to produce, and when. It is open to all who want to participate and holds discussions on an open mailing list. Working groups hold open sessions at IETF meetings, where the onsite registration fee in 2024 was between (early registration) and $1200 per person for the week. Significant discounts are available for students and remote participants. As working groups do not make decisions at IETF meetings, with all decisions taken later on the working group mailing list, meeting attendance is not required for contributors.

Rough consensus is the primary basis for decision making. There are no formal voting procedures. Each working group is intended to complete work on its topic and then disband. In some cases, the working group will instead have its charter updated to take on new tasks as appropriate.

The working groups are grouped into areas by subject matter . Each area is overseen by an area director (AD), with most areas having two ADs. The ADs are responsible for appointing working group chairs. The area directors, together with the IETF Chair, form the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), which is responsible for the overall operation of the IETF.

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversees the IETF&#x27;s external relationships. The IAB provides long-range technical direction for Internet development. The IAB also manages the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), with which the IETF has a number of cross-group relations.

A nominating committee (NomCom) of ten randomly chosen volunteers who participate regularly at meetings, a non-voting chair and 4-5 liaisons, is vested with the power to appoint, reappoint, and remove members of the IESG, IAB, IETF Trust and the IETF LLC. To date, no one has been removed by a NomCom, although several people have resigned their positions, requiring replacements.

In 1993 the IETF changed from an activity supported by the US federal government to an independent, international activity associated with the Internet Society, a US-based 501(c)(3) organization. In 2018 the Internet Society created a subsidiary, the IETF Administration LLC, to be the corporate, legal and financial home for the IETF. IETF activities are funded by meeting fees, meeting sponsors and by the Internet Society via its organizational membership and the proceeds of the Public Interest Registry.

In December 2005, the IETF Trust was established to manage the copyrighted materials produced by the IETF.

===Steering group===
The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) is a body composed of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) chair and area directors. It provides the final technical review of Internet standards and is responsible for day-to-day management of the IETF. It receives appeals of the decisions of the working groups, and the IESG makes the decision to progress documents in the standards track.

The chair of the IESG is the area director of the general area, who also serves as the overall IETF chair. Members of the IESG include the two directors, sometimes three, of each of the following areas:
* Applications and real-time (art)
* General (gen)
* Internet (int)
* Operations and management (ops)
* Routing (rtg)
* Security (sec)
* Web and Internet transport (wit)

Liaison and &quot;ex officio&quot; members include:
*IETF executive director
*IAB chair
*Appointed liaison from the IAB
*Liaison from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
*Liaison from the Request for Comments (RFC) editor

== Early leadership and administrative history ==

The Gateway Algorithms and Data Structures (GADS) Task Force was the precursor to the IETF. Its chairman was David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.

In January 1986, the Internet Activities Board (IAB; now called the Internet Architecture Board) decided to divide GADS into two entities: an Internet Architecture (INARC) Task Force chaired by Mills to pursue research goals, and the IETF to handle nearer-term engineering and technology transfer issues. The first IETF chair was Mike Corrigan, who was then the technical program manager for the Defense Data Network (DDN). Also in 1986, after leaving DARPA, Robert E. Kahn founded the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), which began providing administrative support to the IETF.

In 1987, Corrigan was succeeded as IETF chair by Phill Gross.

Effective March 1, 1989, but providing support dating back to late 1988, CNRI and NSF entered into a cooperative agreement, No. NCR-8820945, wherein CNRI agreed to create and provide a &quot;secretariat&quot; for the &quot;overall coordination, management and support of the work of the IAB, its various task forces and, particularly, the IETF&quot;.

In 1992, CNRI supported the formation and early funding of the Internet Society, which took on the IETF as a fiscally sponsored project, along with the IAB, the IRTF, and the organization of annual INET meetings. Gross continued to serve as IETF chair throughout this transition. Cerf, Kahn, and Lyman Chapin announced the formation of ISOC as &quot;a professional society to facilitate, support, and promote the evolution and growth of the Internet as a global research communications infrastructure&quot;. At the first board meeting of the Internet Society, Cerf, representing CNRI, offered, &quot;In the event a deficit occurs, CNRI has agreed to contribute up to USD$102,000 to offset it.&quot; In 1993, Cerf continued to support the formation of ISOC while working for CNRI, and the role of ISOC in &quot;the official procedures for creating and documenting Internet Standards&quot; was codified in the IETF&#x27;s .

In 1995, IETF&#x27;s describes ISOC&#x27;s role in the IETF as being purely administrative, and ISOC as having &quot;no influence whatsoever on the Internet Standards process, the Internet Standards or their technical content&quot;.

In 1998, CNRI established Foretec Seminars, Inc. (Foretec), a for-profit subsidiary to take over providing secretariat services to the IETF. Foretec provided these services until at least 2004. By 2013, Foretec was dissolved.

In 2003, IETF&#x27;s described IETFs role in appointing three board members to the ISOC&#x27;s board of directors.

In 2018, ISOC established The IETF Administration LLC, a separate LLC to handle the administration of the IETF. In 2019, the LLC issued a call for proposals to provide secretariat services to the IETF.

==Meetings==
The first IETF meeting was attended by 21 US federal government-funded researchers on 16 January 1986. It was a continuation of the work of the earlier GADS Task Force. Representatives from non-governmental entities (such as gateway vendors) were invited to attend starting with the fourth IETF meeting in October 1986. Since that time all IETF meetings have been open to the public.

Initially, the IETF met quarterly, but from 1991, it has been meeting three times a year. The initial meetings were very small, with fewer than 35 people in attendance at each of the first five meetings. The maximum attendance during the first 13 meetings was only 120 attendees. This occurred at the twelfth meeting, held during January 1989. These meetings have grown in both participation and scope a great deal since the early 1990s; it had a maximum attendance of 2810 at the December 2000 IETF held in San Diego, California. Attendance declined with industry restructuring during the early 2000s, and is currently around 1200.

The locations for IETF meetings vary greatly. A list of past and future meeting locations is on the IETF meetings page. The IETF strives to hold its meetings near where most of the IETF volunteers are located. IETF meetings are held three times a year, with one meeting each in Asia, Europe and North America. An occasional exploratory meeting is held outside of those regions in place of one of the other regions.

The IETF also organizes hackathons during the IETF meetings. The focus is on implementing code that will improve standards in terms of quality and interoperability.

==Operations==
The details of IETF operations have changed considerably as the organization has grown, but the basic mechanism remains publication of proposed specifications, development based on the proposals, review and independent testing by participants, and republication as a revised proposal, a draft proposal, or eventually as an Internet Standard. IETF standards are developed in an open, all-inclusive process in which any interested individual can participate. All IETF documents are freely available over the Internet and can be reproduced at will. Multiple, working, useful, interoperable implementations are the chief requirement before an IETF proposed specification can become a standard. Most specifications are focused on single protocols rather than tightly interlocked systems. This has allowed the protocols to be used in many different systems, and its standards are routinely re-used by bodies which create full-fledged architectures (e.g. 3GPP IMS).

Because it relies on volunteers and uses &quot;rough consensus and running code&quot; as its touchstone, results can be slow whenever the number of volunteers is either too small to make progress, or so large as to make consensus difficult, or when volunteers lack the necessary expertise. For protocols like SMTP, which is used to transport e-mail for a user community in the many hundreds of millions, there is also considerable resistance to any change that is not fully backward compatible, except for IPv6. Work within the IETF on ways to improve the speed of the standards-making process is ongoing but, because the number of volunteers with opinions on it is very great, consensus on improvements has been slow to develop.

The IETF cooperates with the W3C, ISO/IEC, ITU, and other standards bodies.

Statistics are available that show who the top contributors by RFC publication are. While the IETF only allows for participation by individuals, and not by corporations or governments, sponsorship information is available from these statistics.

==Chairs==
The IETF chairperson is selected by the NomCom process for a two-year renewable term. Before 1993, the IETF Chair was selected by the IAB.

A list of the past and current chairs of the IETF:
* Mike Corrigan (1986)
* Phill Gross (1986–1994)
* Paul Mockapetris (1994–1996)
* Fred Baker (1996–2001)
* Harald Tveit Alvestrand (2001–2005)
* Brian Carpenter (2005–2007)
* Russ Housley (2007–2013)
* Jari Arkko (2013–2017)
* Alissa Cooper (2017–2021)
* Lars Eggert (2021–2024)
* Roman Danyliw (2024–)
==Topics of interest==
The IETF works on a broad range of networking technologies which provide foundation for the Internet&#x27;s growth and evolution.

===Automated network management===
It aims to improve the efficiency in management of networks as they grow in size and complexity. The IETF is also standardizing protocols for autonomic networking that enables networks to be self managing.

===Internet of things===
It is a network of physical objects or things that are embedded with electronics, sensors, software and also enables objects to exchange data with operator, manufacturer and other connected devices. Several IETF working groups are developing protocols that are directly relevant to IoT.

===New transport technology===
Its development provides the ability of internet applications to send data over the Internet. There are some well-established transport protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) which are continuously getting extended and refined to meet the needs of the global Internet.

<doc id="15286" wikidata="Q304545" url="?curid=15286" title="ISM radio band">
<text>The ISM radio bands are portions of the radio spectrum reserved internationally for &quot;industrial, scientific, and medical&quot; (ISM) purposes, excluding applications in telecommunications. 
Examples of applications for the use of radio frequency (RF) energy in these bands include RF heating, microwave ovens, and medical diathermy machines. The powerful emissions of these devices can create electromagnetic interference and disrupt radio communication using the same frequency, so these devices are limited to certain bands of frequencies. In general, communications equipment operating in ISM bands must tolerate any interference generated by ISM applications, and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation in these bands.

Despite the intent of the original allocations, in recent years the fastest-growing use of these bands has been for short-range, low-power wireless communications systems, since these bands are often approved for such devices, which can be used without a government license, as would otherwise be required for transmitters; ISM frequencies are often chosen for this purpose as they already must tolerate interference issues. Cordless phones, Bluetooth devices, near-field communication (NFC) devices, garage door openers, baby monitors, and wireless computer networks (Wi-Fi) may all use the ISM frequencies, although these low-power transmitters are not considered to be ISM devices.

==Definition==
The ISM bands are defined by the ITU Radio Regulations (article 5) in footnotes 5.138, 5.150, and 5.280 of the Radio Regulations. Individual countries&#x27; use of the bands designated in these sections may differ due to variations in national radio regulations. Because communication devices using the ISM bands must tolerate any interference from ISM equipment, unlicensed operations are typically permitted to use these bands, since unlicensed operation typically needs to be tolerant of interference from other devices anyway. The ISM bands share allocations with unlicensed and licensed operations; however, due to the high likelihood of harmful interference, licensed use of the bands is typically low. In the United States, uses of the ISM bands are governed by Part 18 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, while Part 15 contains the rules for unlicensed communication devices, even those that share ISM frequencies. In Europe, the ETSI develops standards for the use of short-range devices, some of which operate in ISM bands. The use of the ISM bands is regulated by the national spectrum regulation authorities that are members of the CEPT.

=== Frequency allocations ===
The allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to &quot;Article 5&quot; of the ITU Radio Regulations (edition 2012).

In order to improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation, the majority of service allocations stipulated in this document were incorporated in national tables of frequency allocations and utilisations which are within the responsibilities of the appropriate national administrations. The allocation might be primary, secondary, exclusive, or shared. Exclusive or shared utilization is within the responsibility of administrations.

; ITU frequency allocations:
Type A (footnote 5.138) = frequency bands are designated for &quot;ISM applications&quot;. The use of these frequency bands for ISM applications shall be subject to special authorization by the administration concerned, in agreement with other administrations whose radiocommunication services might be affected. In applying this provision, administrations shall have due regard to the latest relevant ITU-R Recommendations.

Type B (footnote 5.150) = frequency bands are also designated for ISM applications. Radiocommunication services operating within these bands must accept harmful interference which may be caused by these applications.

ITU RR, (Footnote 5.280) = In Germany, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Switzerland, the band 433.05–434.79 MHz (center frequency 433.92 MHz) is designated for &quot;ISM applications&quot;. Radio communication services of these countries operating within this band must accept harmful interference which may be caused by these applications.

==History==

The ISM bands were first established at the International Telecommunications Conference of the ITU in Atlantic City, 1947. The American delegation specifically proposed several bands, including the now commonplace 2.4 GHz band, to accommodate the then nascent process of microwave heating; however, FCC annual reports of that time suggest that much preparation was done ahead of these presentations.

The report of the August 9th 1947 meeting of the Allocation of Frequencies committee includes the remark:

&quot;The delegate of the United States, referring to his request that the frequency 2450 Mc/s be allocated for I.S.M., indicated that there was in existence in the United States, and working on this frequency a diathermy machine and an electronic cooker, and that the latter might eventually be installed in transatlantic ships and airplanes. There was therefore some point in attempting to reach world agreement on this subject.&quot;

Radio frequencies in the ISM bands have been used for communication purposes, although such devices may experience interference from non-communication sources. In the United States, as early as 1958 Class D Citizens Band, a Part 95 service, was allocated to frequencies that are also allocated to ISM. [1]

In the U.S., the FCC first made unlicensed spread spectrum available in the ISM bands in rules adopted on May 9, 1985. The FCC action was proposed by Michael Marcus of the FCC staff in 1980 and the subsequent regulatory action took five more years. It was part of a broader proposal to allow civil use of spread spectrum technology and was opposed at the time by mainstream equipment manufacturers and many radio system operators.

Many other countries later developed similar regulations, enabling use of this technology. 

== Applications ==
 Industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) applications (of radio frequency energy) (short: ISM applications) are – according to &quot;article 1.15&quot; of the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) – defined as «&quot;Operation of equipment or appliances designed to generate and use locally radio frequency energy for industrial, scientific, medical, domestic or similar purposes, excluding applications in the field of telecommunications&quot;.»

The original ISM specifications envisioned that the bands would be used primarily for noncommunication purposes, such as heating. The bands are still widely used for these purposes. For many people, the most commonly encountered ISM device is the home microwave oven operating at 2.45 GHz which uses microwaves to cook food. Industrial heating is another big application area; such as induction heating, microwave heat treating, plastic softening, and plastic welding processes. In medical settings, shortwave and microwave diathermy machines use radio waves in the ISM bands to apply deep heating to the body for relaxation and healing. More recently hyperthermia therapy uses microwaves to heat tissue to kill cancer cells.

However, as detailed below, the increasing congestion of the radio spectrum, the increasing sophistication of microelectronics, and the attraction of unlicensed use, has in recent decades led to an explosion of uses of these bands for short range communication systems for wireless devices, which are now by far the largest uses of these bands. These are sometimes called &quot;non ISM&quot; uses since they do not fall under the originally envisioned &quot;industrial&quot;, &quot;scientific&quot;, and &quot;medical&quot; application areas. One of the largest applications has been wireless networking (Wi-Fi). The IEEE 802.11 wireless networking protocols, the standards on which almost all wireless systems are based, use the ISM bands. Virtually all laptops, tablet computers, computer printers and cellphones now have 802.11 wireless modems using the 2.4 and 5.7 GHz ISM bands. Bluetooth is another networking technology using the 2.4 GHz band, which can be problematic given the probability of interference. Near-field communication (NFC) devices such as proximity cards and contactless smart cards use the lower-frequency 13 and 27 MHz ISM bands. Other short-range devices using the ISM bands are: wireless microphones, baby monitors, garage door openers, wireless doorbells, keyless entry systems for vehicles, radio control channels for UAVs (drones), wireless surveillance systems, RFID systems for merchandise, and wild animal tracking systems.

Some electrodeless lamp designs are ISM devices, which use RF emissions to excite fluorescent tubes. Sulfur lamps are commercially available plasma lamps, which use 2.45 GHz magnetrons to heat sulfur into a brightly glowing plasma.

Long-distance wireless power systems have been proposed and experimented with which would use high-power transmitters and rectennas, in lieu of overhead transmission lines and underground cables, to send power to remote locations. NASA has studied using microwave power transmission on 2.45 GHz to send energy collected by solar power satellites back to the ground.

Also in space applications, a helicon double-layer ion thruster is a prototype spacecraft propulsion engine which uses a 13.56 MHz transmission to break down and heat gas into plasma.

==Common non-ISM uses==
In recent years ISM bands have also been shared with (non-ISM) license-free error-tolerant communications applications such as wireless sensor networks in the 915 MHz and 2.450 GHz bands, as well as wireless LANs and cordless phones in the 915 MHz, 2.450 GHz, and 5.800 GHz bands. Because unlicensed devices are required to be tolerant of ISM emissions in these bands, unlicensed low-power users are generally able to operate in these bands without causing problems for ISM users. ISM equipment does not necessarily include a radio receiver in the ISM band (e.g. a microwave oven does not have a receiver).

In the United States, according to 47 CFR Part 15.5, low power communication devices must accept interference from licensed users of that frequency band, and the Part 15 device must not cause interference to licensed users. Note that the 915 MHz band should not be used in countries outside Region 2, except those that specifically allow it, such as Australia and Israel, especially those that use the GSM-900 band for cellphones. The ISM bands are also widely used for radio-frequency identification (RFID) applications with the most commonly used band being the 13.56 MHz band used by systems compliant with ISO/IEC 14443 including those used by biometric passports and contactless smart cards.

In Europe, the use of the ISM band is covered by Short Range Device regulations issued by European Commission, based on technical recommendations by CEPT and standards by ETSI. In most of Europe, LPD433 band is allowed for license-free voice communication in addition to PMR446.

Wireless network devices use wavebands as follows:
* IEEE 802.11/Wi-Fi 2450 MHz and 5800 MHz bands
* Bluetooth 2450 MHz band falls under WPAN
* ANT / ANT+ (originates from Adaptive Network Topology) is a proprietary (but open access) multicast wireless sensor network technology designed and marketed by ANT Wireless. ANT devices may use any RF frequency from 2400MHz to 2524MHz, with the exception of 2457MHz, which is reserved for ANT+ devices.
* IEEE 802.15.4Zigbee and other personal area networks may use the and ISM bands because of frequency sharing between different allocations.

Wireless LANs and cordless phones can also use bands other than those shared with ISM, but such uses require approval on a country by country basis. DECT phones use allocated spectrum outside the ISM bands that differs in Europe and North America. Ultra-wideband LANs require more spectrum than the ISM bands can provide, so the relevant standards such as IEEE 802.15.4a are designed to make use of spectrum outside the ISM bands. Despite the fact that these additional bands are outside the official ITU-R ISM bands, because they are used for the same types of low power personal communications, they are sometimes incorrectly referred to as ISM bands as well.

Several brands of radio control equipment use the band range for low power remote control of toys, from gas powered cars to miniature aircraft.

Worldwide Digital Cordless Telecommunications or WDCT is a technology that uses the radio spectrum.

Google&#x27;s Project Loon used ISM bands (specifically 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands) for balloon-to-balloon and balloon-to-ground communications.

Pursuant to 47 CFR Part 97 some ISM bands are used by licensed amateur radio operators for communicationincluding amateur television.

<doc id="15287" wikidata="Q170198" url="?curid=15287" title="Series (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a series is, roughly speaking, an addition of infinitely many terms, one after the other. The study of series is a major part of calculus and its generalization, mathematical analysis. Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures in combinatorics through generating functions. The mathematical properties of infinite series make them widely applicable in other quantitative disciplines such as physics, computer science, statistics and finance.

Among the Ancient Greeks, the idea that a potentially infinite summation could produce a finite result was considered paradoxical, most famously in Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes. Nonetheless, infinite series were applied practically by Ancient Greek mathematicians including Archimedes, for instance in the quadrature of the parabola. The mathematical side of Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes was resolved using the concept of a limit during the 17th century, especially through the early calculus of Isaac Newton. The resolution was made more rigorous and further improved in the 19th century through the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss and Augustin-Louis Cauchy, among others, answering questions about which of these sums exist via the completeness of the real numbers and whether series terms can be rearranged or not without changing their sums using absolute convergence and conditional convergence of series. 

In modern terminology, any ordered infinite sequence formula_1 of terms, whether those terms are numbers, functions, matrices, or anything else that can be added, defines a series, which is the addition of the one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, series are often also called infinite series. Series are represented by an expression like
formula_2
or, using capital-sigma summation notation,
formula_3

The infinite sequence of additions expressed by a series cannot be explicitly performed in sequence in a finite amount of time. However, if the terms and their finite sums belong to a set that has limits, it may be possible to assign a value to a series, called the sum of the series. This value is the limit as tends to infinity of the finite sums of the first terms of the series if the limit exists. These finite sums are called the partial sums of the series. Using summation notation,
formula_4
if it exists. When the limit exists, the series is convergent or summable and also the sequence formula_1 is summable, and otherwise, when the limit does not exist, the series is divergent.

The expression formula_6 denotes both the series—the implicit process of adding the terms one after the other indefinitely—and, if the series is convergent, the sum of the series—the explicit limit of the process. This is a generalization of the similar convention of denoting by formula_7 both the addition—the process of adding—and its result—the &quot;sum&quot; of and .

Commonly, the terms of a series come from a ring, often the field formula_8 of the real numbers or the field formula_9 of the complex numbers. If so, the set of all series is also itself a ring, one in which the addition consists of adding series terms together term by term and the multiplication is the Cauchy product.

==Definition==

=== Series ===
A &quot;series&quot; or, redundantly, an &quot;infinite series&quot;, is an infinite sum. It is often represented as
formula_10
where the terms formula_11 are the members of a sequence of numbers, functions, or anything else that can be added. A series may also be represented with capital-sigma notation:
formula_12

It is also common to express series using a few first terms, an ellipsis, a general term, and then a final ellipsis, the general term being an expression of the th term as a function of :
formula_13
For example, Euler&#x27;s number can be defined with the series
formula_14 
where formula_15 denotes the product of the formula_16 first positive integers, and formula_17 is conventionally equal to formula_18

=== Partial sum of a series ===
Given a series formula_19, its th &quot;partial sum&quot; is
formula_20

Some authors directly identify a series with its sequence of partial sums. Either the sequence of partial sums or the sequence of terms completely characterizes the series, and the sequence of terms can be recovered from the sequence of partial sums by taking the differences between consecutive elements,
formula_21

Partial summation of a sequence is an example of a linear sequence transformation, and it is also known as the prefix sum in computer science. The inverse transformation for recovering a sequence from its partial sums is the finite difference, another linear sequence transformation. 

Partial sums of series sometimes have simpler closed form expressions, for instance an arithmetic series has partial sums
formula_22
and a geometric series has partial sums
formula_23
if or simply if .

===Sum of a series===

Strictly speaking, a series is said to &quot;converge&quot;, to be &quot;convergent&quot;, or to be &quot;summable&quot; when the sequence of its partial sums has a limit. When the limit of the sequence of partial sums does not exist, the series &quot;diverges&quot; or is &quot;divergent&quot;. When the limit of the partial sums exists, it is called the &quot;sum of the series&quot; or &quot;value of the series&quot;:
formula_24
A series with only a finite number of nonzero terms is always convergent. Such series are useful for considering finite sums without taking care of the numbers of terms. When the sum exists, the difference between the sum of a series and its formula_16th partial sum, formula_26 is known as the formula_16th &quot;truncation error&quot; of the infinite series.

An example of a convergent series is the geometric series
formula_28

It can be shown by algebraic computation that each partial sum formula_29 is 
formula_30 As one has 
formula_31
the series is convergent and converges to with truncation errors formula_32.

By contrast, the geometric series
formula_33
is divergent in the real numbers. However, it is convergent in the extended real number line, with formula_34 as its limit and formula_34 as its truncation error at every step.

When a series&#x27;s sequence of partial sums is not easily calculated and evaluated for convergence directly, convergence tests can be used to prove that the series converges or diverges.

== Grouping and rearranging terms ==

===Grouping===
In ordinary finite summations, terms of the summation can be grouped and ungrouped freely without changing the result of the summation as a consequence of the associativity of addition. formula_36formula_37formula_38 Similarly, in a series, any finite groupings of terms of the series will not change the limit of the partial sums of the series and thus will not change the sum of the series. However, if an infinite number of groupings is performed in an infinite series, then the partial sums of the grouped series may have a different limit than the original series and different groupings may have different limits from one another; the sum of formula_39 may not equal the sum of formula_40formula_41 

For example, Grandi&#x27;s series has a sequence of partial sums that alternates back and forth between and and does not converge. Grouping its elements in pairs creates the series formula_42formula_43 which has partial sums equal to zero at every term and thus sums to zero. Grouping its elements in pairs starting after the first creates the series formula_44formula_45formula_46 which has partial sums equal to one for every term and thus sums to one, a different result.

In general, grouping the terms of a series creates a new series with a sequence of partial sums that is a subsequence of the partial sums of the original series. This means that if the original series converges, so does the new series after grouping: all infinite subsequences of a convergent sequence also converge to the same limit. However, if the original series diverges, then the grouped series do not necessarily diverge, as in this example of Grandi&#x27;s series above. However, divergence of a grouped series does imply the original series must be divergent, since it proves there is a subsequence of the partial sums of the original series which is not convergent, which would be impossible if it were convergent. This reasoning was applied in Oresme&#x27;s proof of the divergence of the harmonic series, and it is the basis for the general Cauchy condensation test.

=== Rearrangement ===
In ordinary finite summations, terms of the summation can be rearranged freely without changing the result of the summation as a consequence of the commutativity of addition. formula_36formula_48formula_49 Similarly, in a series, any finite rearrangements of terms of a series does not change the limit of the partial sums of the series and thus does not change the sum of the series: for any finite rearrangement, there will be some term after which the rearrangement did not affect any further terms: any effects of rearrangement can be isolated to the finite summation up to that term, and finite summations do not change under rearrangement.

However, as for grouping, an infinitary rearrangement of terms of a series can sometimes lead to a change in the limit of the partial sums of the series. Series with sequences of partial sums that converge to a value but whose terms could be rearranged to a form a series with partial sums that converge to some other value are called conditionally convergent series. Those that converge to the same value regardless of rearrangement are called unconditionally convergent series.

For series of real numbers and complex numbers, a series formula_39 is unconditionally convergent if and only if the series summing the absolute values of its terms, formula_51 is also convergent, a property called absolute convergence. Otherwise, any series of real numbers or complex numbers that converges but does not converge absolutely is conditionally convergent. Any conditionally convergent sum of real numbers can be rearranged to yield any other real number as a limit, or to diverge. These claims are the content of the Riemann series theorem.

A historically important example of conditional convergence is the alternating harmonic series,

formula_52
which has a sum of the natural logarithm of 2, while the sum of the absolute values of the terms is the harmonic series,
formula_53
which diverges per the divergence of the harmonic series, so the alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent. For instance, rearranging the terms of the alternating harmonic series so that each positive term of the original series is followed by two negative terms of the original series rather than just one yields 
formula_54
which is formula_55 times the original series, so it would have a sum of half of the natural logarithm of 2. By the Riemann series theorem, rearrangements of the alternating harmonic series to yield any other real number are also possible.

== Operations ==

=== Series addition ===
The addition of two series formula_56 and formula_57 is given by the termwise sum formula_58, or, in summation notation,
formula_59 

Using the symbols formula_60 and formula_61 for the partial sums of the added series and formula_62 for the partial sums of the resulting series, this definition implies the partial sums of the resulting series follow formula_63 Then the sum of the resulting series, i.e., the limit of the sequence of partial sums of the resulting series, satisfies
formula_64
when the limits exist. Therefore, first, the series resulting from addition is summable if the series added were summable, and, second, the sum of the resulting series is the addition of the sums of the added series. The addition of two divergent series may yield a convergent series: for instance, the addition of a divergent series with a series of its terms times formula_65 will yield a series of all zeros that converges to zero. However, for any two series where one converges and the other diverges, the result of their addition diverges.

For series of real numbers or complex numbers, series addition is associative, commutative, and invertible. Therefore series addition gives the sets of convergent series of real numbers or complex numbers the structure of an abelian group and also gives the sets of all series of real numbers or complex numbers (regardless of convergence properties) the structure of an abelian group.

=== Scalar multiplication ===
The product of a series formula_56 with a constant number formula_67, called a scalar in this context, is given by the termwise product formula_68, or, in summation notation,

formula_69

Using the symbols formula_60 for the partial sums of the original series and formula_71 for the partial sums of the series after multiplication by formula_67, this definition implies that formula_73 for all formula_74 and therefore also formula_75when the limits exist. Therefore if a series is summable, any nonzero scalar multiple of the series is also summable and vice versa: if a series is divergent, then any nonzero scalar multiple of it is also divergent.

Scalar multiplication of real numbers and complex numbers is associative, commutative, invertible, and it distributes over series addition. 

In summary, series addition and scalar multiplication gives the set of convergent series and the set of series of real numbers the structure of a real vector space. Similarly, one gets complex vector spaces for series and convergent series of complex numbers. All these vector spaces are infinite dimensional.

=== Series multiplication ===
The multiplication of two series formula_76 and formula_77 to generate a third series formula_78, called the Cauchy product, can be written in summation notation
formula_79
with each formula_80formula_81 Here, the convergence of the partial sums of the series formula_78 is not as simple to establish as for addition. However, if both series formula_76 and formula_77 are absolutely convergent series, then the series resulting from multiplying them also converges absolutely with a sum equal to the product of the two sums of the multiplied series,
formula_85

Series multiplication of absolutely convergent series of real numbers and complex numbers is associative, commutative, and distributes over series addition. Together with series addition, series multiplication gives the sets of absolutely convergent series of real numbers or complex numbers the structure of a commutative ring, and together with scalar multiplication as well, the structure of a commutative algebra; these operations also give the sets of all series of real numbers or complex numbers the structure of an associative algebra.

==Examples of numerical series==

* A &quot;geometric series&quot; is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a constant number (called the common ratio in this context). For example: formula_86 In general, a geometric series with initial term formula_87 and common ratio formula_88, formula_89 converges if and only if formula_90, in which case it converges to formula_91.
* The &quot;harmonic series&quot; is the series formula_92 The harmonic series is divergent.
* An &quot;alternating series&quot; is a series where terms alternate signs. Examples: formula_93 the alternating harmonic series, and formula_94 the Leibniz formula for formula_95
* A telescoping series formula_96 converges if the sequence converges to a limit as goes to infinity. The value of the series is then .
* An &quot;arithmetico-geometric series&quot; is a series that has terms which are each the product of an element of an arithmetic progression with the corresponding element of a geometric progression. Example: formula_97
* The Dirichlet series formula_98 converges for and diverges for , which can be shown with the integral test for convergence described below in convergence tests. As a function of , the sum of this series is Riemann&#x27;s zeta function.
* Hypergeometric series: formula_99 and their generalizations (such as basic hypergeometric series and elliptic hypergeometric series) frequently appear in integrable systems and mathematical physics.
* There are some elementary series whose convergence is not yet known/proven. For example, it is unknown whether the Flint Hills series, formula_100 converges or not. The convergence depends on how well formula_101 can be approximated with rational numbers (which is unknown as of yet). More specifically, the values of with large numerical contributions to the sum are the numerators of the continued fraction convergents of formula_101, a sequence beginning with 1, 3, 22, 333, 355, 103993, ... . These are integers that are close to formula_103 for some integer , so that formula_104 is close to formula_105 and its reciprocal is large.

==Convergence testing==
One of the simplest tests for convergence of a series, applicable to all series, is the &quot;vanishing condition&quot; or &quot;th-term test&quot;: If formula_112, then the series diverges; if formula_113, then the test is inconclusive.

===Absolute convergence tests===
When every term of a series is a non-negative real number, for instance when the terms are the absolute values of another series of real numbers or complex numbers, the sequence of partial sums is non-decreasing. Therefore a series with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums is bounded, and so finding a bound for a series or for the absolute values of its terms is an effective way to prove convergence or absolute convergence of a series. 

For example, the series formula_114is convergent and absolutely convergent because formula_115 for all formula_116 and a telescoping sum argument implies that the partial sums of the series of those non-negative bounding terms are themselves bounded above by 2. The exact value of this series is formula_117; see Basel problem.

This type of bounding strategy is the basis for general series comparison tests. First is the general &quot;direct comparison test&quot;: For any series formula_118, If formula_119 is an absolutely convergent series such that formula_120 for some positive real number formula_121 and for sufficiently large formula_16, then formula_118 converges absolutely as well. If formula_124 diverges, and formula_125 for all sufficiently large formula_16, then formula_118 also fails to converge absolutely, although it could still be conditionally convergent, for example, if the formula_128 alternate in sign. Second is the general &quot;limit comparison test&quot;: If formula_119 is an absolutely convergent series such that formula_130 for sufficiently large formula_16, then formula_118 converges absolutely as well. If formula_133 diverges, and formula_134 for all sufficiently large formula_16, then formula_118 also fails to converge absolutely, though it could still be conditionally convergent if the formula_128 vary in sign.

Using comparisons to geometric series specifically, those two general comparison tests imply two further common and generally useful tests for convergence of series with non-negative terms or for absolute convergence of series with general terms. First is the &quot;ratio test&quot;: if there exists a constant formula_138 such that formula_139 for all sufficiently large formula_16, then formula_141 converges absolutely. When the ratio is less than formula_142, but not less than a constant less than formula_142, convergence is possible but this test does not establish it. Second is the &quot;root test&quot;: if there exists a constant formula_138 such that formula_145 for all sufficiently large formula_16, then formula_141 converges absolutely.

Alternatively, using comparisons to series representations of integrals specifically, one derives the &quot;integral test&quot;: if formula_148 is a positive monotone decreasing function defined on the interval formula_149 then for a series with terms formula_150 for all formula_16, formula_141 converges if and only if the integral formula_153 is finite. Using comparisons to flattened-out versions of a series leads to Cauchy&#x27;s condensation test: if the sequence of terms formula_154 is non-negative and non-increasing, then the two series formula_141 and formula_156 are either both convergent or both divergent.

===Conditional convergence tests===

A series of real or complex numbers is said to be &quot;conditionally convergent&quot; (or &quot;semi-convergent&quot;) if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. Conditional convergence is tested for differently than absolute convergence.

One important example of a test for conditional convergence is the &quot;alternating series test&quot; or &quot;Leibniz test&quot;: A series of the form formula_157 with all formula_158 is called &quot;alternating&quot;. Such a series converges if the non-negative sequence formula_154 is monotone decreasing and converges to formula_160. The converse is in general not true. A famous example of an application of this test is the alternating harmonic series
formula_52
which is convergent per the alternating series test (and its sum is equal to formula_162), though the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the ordinary harmonic series, which is divergent.

The alternating series test can be viewed as a special case of the more general &quot;Dirichlet&#x27;s test&quot;: if formula_163 is a sequence of terms of decreasing nonnegative real numbers that converges to zero, and formula_164 is a sequence of terms with bounded partial sums, then the series formula_165 converges. Taking formula_166 recovers the alternating series test.

&quot;Abel&#x27;s test&quot; is another important technique for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form formula_167 where the partial sums of the series with terms formula_168, formula_169 are bounded, formula_170 has bounded variation, and formula_171 exists: if formula_172 formula_173 and formula_174converges, then the series formula_141 is convergent.

Other specialized convergence tests for specific types of series include the Dini test for Fourier series.

===Evaluation of truncation errors===
The evaluation of truncation errors of series is important in numerical analysis (especially validated numerics and computer-assisted proof). It can be used to prove convergence and to analyze rates of convergence.

====Alternating series====

When conditions of the alternating series test are satisfied by formula_176, there is an exact error evaluation. Set formula_29 to be the partial sum formula_178 of the given alternating series formula_179. Then the next inequality holds:
formula_180

====Hypergeometric series====

By using the ratio, we can obtain the evaluation of the error term when the hypergeometric series is truncated.

====Matrix exponential====

For the matrix exponential:

formula_181

the following error evaluation holds (scaling and squaring method):

formula_182

== Sums of divergent series ==

Under many circumstances, it is desirable to assign generalized sums to series which fail to converge in the strict sense that their sequences of partial sums do not converge. A &quot;summation method&quot; is any method for assigning sums to divergent series in a way that systematically extends the classical notion of the sum of a series. Summation methods include Cesàro summation, generalized Cesàro summation, Abel summation, and Borel summation, in order of applicability to increasingly divergent series. These methods are all based on sequence transformations of the original series of terms or of its sequence of partial sums. An alternative family of summation methods are based on analytic continuation rather than sequence transformation.

A variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known. The Silverman–Toeplitz theorem characterizes &quot;matrix summation methods&quot;, which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients. The most general methods for summing a divergent series are non-constructive and concern Banach limits.

==Series of functions==

A series of real- or complex-valued functions

formula_183

is pointwise convergent to a limit on a set if the series converges for each in as a series of real or complex numbers. Equivalently, the partial sums

formula_184

converge to as goes to infinity for each in .

A stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is uniform convergence. A series converges uniformly in a set formula_185 if it converges pointwise to the function at every point of formula_185 and the supremum of these pointwise errors in approximating the limit by the th partial sum,

formula_187

converges to zero with increasing , of .

Uniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit. For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous. Similarly, if the are integrable on a closed and bounded interval and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on and can be integrated term by term. Tests for uniform convergence include Weierstrass&#x27; M-test, Abel&#x27;s uniform convergence test, Dini&#x27;s test, and the Cauchy criterion.

More sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined. In measure theory, for instance, a series of functions converges almost everywhere if it converges pointwise except on a set of measure zero. Other modes of convergence depend on a different metric space structure on the space of functions under consideration. For instance, a series of functions converges in mean to a limit function on a set if

formula_188

===Power series===

A power series is a series of the form

formula_189

The Taylor series at a point of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of . For example, the series

formula_190

is the Taylor series of formula_191 at the origin and converges to it for every .

Unless it converges only at , such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc. The radius of this disc is known as the radius of convergence, and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients . The convergence is uniform on closed and bounded (that is, compact) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is uniformly convergent on compact sets.

Historically, mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.

=== Formal power series ===
While many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as &quot;formal sums&quot;, meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol &quot;+&quot; is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in combinatorics to describe and study sequences that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example, using the method of generating functions. The Hilbert–Poincaré series is a formal power series used to study graded algebras.

Even if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as addition, multiplication, derivative, antiderivative for power series &quot;formally&quot;, treating the symbol &quot;+&quot; as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a commutative ring, so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the Cauchy product. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the total algebra of the monoid of natural numbers over the underlying term ring. If the underlying term ring is a differential algebra, then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.

===Laurent series===

Laurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents. A Laurent series is thus any series of the form

formula_192

If such a series converges, then in general it does so in an annulus rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points. The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.

===Dirichlet series===

A Dirichlet series is one of the form

formula_193

where is a complex number. For example, if all are equal to , then the Dirichlet series is the Riemann zeta function

formula_194

Like the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in analytic number theory. Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence. In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an analytic function outside the domain of convergence by analytic continuation. For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when , but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on formula_195 with a simple pole at .

This series can be directly generalized to general Dirichlet series.

===Trigonometric series===

A series of functions in which the terms are trigonometric functions is called a trigonometric series:

formula_196

The most important example of a trigonometric series is the Fourier series of a function.

=== Asymptotic series ===

Asymptotic series, typically called asymptotic expansions, are infinite series whose terms are functions of a sequence of different asymptotic orders and whose partial sums are approximations of some other function in an asymptotic limit. In general they do not converge, but they are still useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. They are crucial tools in perturbation theory and in the analysis of algorithms.

An asymptotic series cannot necessarily be made to produce an answer as exactly as desired away from the asymptotic limit, the way that an ordinary convergent series of functions can. In fact, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best practical approximation away from the asymptotic limit after a finite number of terms; if more terms are included, the series will produce less accurate approximations.

==History of the theory of infinite series==

===Development of infinite series===
Infinite series play an important role in modern analysis of Ancient Greek philosophy of motion, particularly in Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes. The paradox of Achilles and the tortoise demonstrates that continuous motion would require an actual infinity of temporal instants, which was arguably an absurdity: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. Zeno is said to have argued that therefore Achilles could &quot;never&quot; reach the tortoise, and thus that continuous movement must be an illusion. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series. The resolution of the purely mathematical and imaginative side of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch up with the tortoise. However, in modern philosophy of motion the physical side of the problem remains open, with both philosophers and physicists doubting, like Zeno, that spatial motions are infinitely divisible: hypothetical reconciliations of quantum mechanics and general relativity in theories of quantum gravity often introduce quantizations of spacetime at the Planck scale.

Greek mathematician Archimedes produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a
method that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of π.

Mathematicians from the Kerala school were studying infinite series .

In the 17th century, James Gregory worked in the new decimal system on infinite series and published several Maclaurin series. In 1715, a general method for constructing the Taylor series for all functions for which they exist was provided by Brook Taylor. Leonhard Euler in the 18th century, developed the theory of hypergeometric series and q-series.

===Convergence criteria===
The investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with Gauss in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series

formula_197

on which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.

Cauchy (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms &quot;convergence&quot; and &quot;divergence&quot; had been introduced long before by Gregory (1668). Leonhard Euler and Gauss had given various criteria, and Colin Maclaurin had anticipated some of Cauchy&#x27;s discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of power series by his expansion of a complex function in such a form.

Abel (1826) in his memoir on the binomial series

formula_198

corrected certain of Cauchy&#x27;s conclusions, and gave a completely scientific summation of the series for complex values of formula_199 and formula_200. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.

Cauchy&#x27;s methods led to special rather than general criteria, and
the same may be said of Raabe (1832), who made the first elaborate investigation of the subject, of De Morgan (from 1842), whose
logarithmic test DuBois-Reymond (1873) and Pringsheim (1889) have
shown to fail within a certain region; of Bertrand (1842), Bonnet
(1843), Malmsten (1846, 1847, the latter without integration); Stokes (1847), Paucker (1852), Chebyshev (1852), and Arndt
(1853).

General criteria began with Kummer (1835), and have been studied by Eisenstein (1847), Weierstrass in his various
contributions to the theory of functions, Dini (1867),
DuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim&#x27;s memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.

===Uniform convergence===
The theory of uniform convergence was treated by Cauchy (1821), his limitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it
successfully were Seidel and Stokes (1847–48). Cauchy took up the
problem again (1853), acknowledging Abel&#x27;s criticism, and reaching
the same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the
doctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the importance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform
convergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.

===Semi-convergence===
A series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent.

Semi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834), who attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by Malmsten (1847). Schlömilch (&quot;Zeitschrift&quot;, Vol.I, p. 192, 1856) also improved Jacobi&#x27;s remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and Bernoulli&#x27;s function

formula_201

Genocchi (1852) has further contributed to the theory.

Among the early writers was Wronski, whose &quot;loi suprême&quot; (1815) was hardly recognized until Cayley (1873) brought it into
prominence.

===Fourier series===
Fourier series were being investigated
as the result of physical considerations at the same time that
Gauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite
series. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple
arcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by
Jacob Bernoulli (1702) and his brother Johann Bernoulli (1701) and still
earlier by Vieta. Euler and Lagrange simplified the subject,
as did Poinsot, Schröter, Glaisher, and Kummer.

Fourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to
expand a given function of in terms of the sines or cosines of
multiples of , a problem which he embodied in his &quot;Théorie analytique de la chaleur&quot; (1822). Euler had already given the formulas for determining the coefficients in the series;
Fourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general
theorem. Poisson (1820–23) also attacked the problem from a
different standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question
of convergence of his series, a matter left for Cauchy (1826) to
attempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly
scientific manner (see convergence of Fourier series). Dirichlet&#x27;s treatment (&quot;Crelle&quot;, 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by
Riemann (1854), Heine, Lipschitz, Schläfli, and
du Bois-Reymond. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of
trigonometric and Fourier series were Dini, Hermite, Halphen,
Krause, Byerly and Appell.

== Summations over general index sets ==

Definitions may be given for infinitary sums over an arbitrary index set formula_202 This generalization introduces two main differences from the usual notion of series: first, there may be no specific order given on the set formula_203; second, the set formula_203 may be uncountable. The notions of convergence need to be reconsidered for these, then, because for instance the concept of conditional convergence depends on the ordering of the index set.

If formula_205 is a function from an index set formula_203 to a set formula_207 then the &quot;series&quot; associated to formula_208 is the formal sum of the elements formula_209 over the index elements formula_210 denoted by the

formula_211

When the index set is the natural numbers formula_212 the function formula_213 is a sequence denoted by formula_214 A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite formula_215 as formula_216 in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers

formula_217

=== Families of non-negative numbers ===
When summing a family formula_218 of non-negative real numbers over the index set formula_203, define

formula_220

When the supremum is finite then the set of formula_221 such that formula_222 is countable. Indeed, for every formula_223 the cardinality formula_224 of the set formula_225 is finite because

formula_226

If formula_203 is countably infinite and enumerated as formula_228 then the above defined sum satisfies

formula_229
provided the value formula_230 is allowed for the sum of the series.

Any sum over non-negative reals can be understood as the integral of a non-negative function with respect to the counting measure, which accounts for the many similarities between the two constructions.

=== Abelian topological groups ===
Let formula_231 be a map, also denoted by formula_232 from some non-empty set formula_203 into a Hausdorff abelian topological group formula_234 
Let formula_235 be the collection of all finite subsets of formula_236 with formula_235 viewed as a directed set, ordered under inclusion formula_238 with union as join. 
The family formula_232 is said to be if the following limit, which is denoted by formula_240 and is called the of formula_232 exists in formula_242

formula_243
Saying that the sum formula_244 is the limit of finite partial sums means that for every neighborhood formula_245 of the origin in formula_246 there exists a finite subset formula_247 of formula_203 such that

formula_249

Because formula_235 is not totally ordered, this is not a limit of a sequence of partial sums, but rather of a net.

For every neighborhood formula_251 of the origin in formula_246 there is a smaller neighborhood formula_245 such that formula_254 It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family formula_232 form a , that is, for every neighborhood formula_251 of the origin in formula_246 there exists a finite subset formula_247 of formula_203 such that

formula_260
which implies that formula_261 for every formula_262 (by taking formula_263 and formula_264).

When formula_265 is complete, a family formula_266 is unconditionally summable in formula_265 if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When formula_265 is complete and formula_232 is unconditionally summable in formula_246 then for every subset formula_271 the corresponding subfamily formula_272 is also unconditionally summable in formula_234

When the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group formula_274

If a family formula_266 in formula_265 is unconditionally summable then for every neighborhood formula_251 of the origin in formula_246 there is a finite subset formula_279 such that formula_261 for every index formula_281 not in formula_282 If formula_265 is a first-countable space then it follows that the set of formula_221 such that formula_285 is countable. This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).

=== Unconditionally convergent series ===
Suppose that formula_286 If a family formula_287 is unconditionally summable in a Hausdorff abelian topological group formula_246 then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,

formula_289

By nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation. When formula_290 is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation formula_291 of the set formula_292 of indices, with the same sum,

formula_293

Conversely, if every permutation of a series formula_290 converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent. When formula_265 is complete then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if formula_265 is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs formula_297, the series

formula_298

converges in formula_234

=== Series in topological vector spaces ===
If formula_265 is a topological vector space (TVS) and formula_301 is a (possibly uncountable) family in formula_265 then this family is summable if the limit formula_303 of the net formula_304 exists in formula_246 where formula_235 is the directed set of all finite subsets of formula_203 directed by inclusion formula_238 and formula_309

It is called absolutely summable if in addition, for every continuous seminorm formula_310 on formula_246 the family formula_312 is summable.
If formula_265 is a normable space and if formula_301 is an absolutely summable family in formula_246 then necessarily all but a countable collection of formula_316’s are zero. Hence, in normed spaces, it is usually only ever necessary to consider series with countably many terms.

Summable families play an important role in the theory of nuclear spaces.

=== Series in Banach and seminormed spaces ===
The notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a seminormed space. 
If formula_317 is a sequence of elements of a normed space formula_265 and if formula_319 then the series formula_320 converges to formula_200 in formula_265 if the sequence of partial sums of the series formula_323 converges to formula_200 in formula_265; to wit,

formula_326

More generally, convergence of series can be defined in any abelian Hausdorff topological group. 
Specifically, in this case, formula_320 converges to formula_200 if the sequence of partial sums converges to formula_329

If formula_330 is a seminormed space, then the notion of absolute convergence becomes: 
A series formula_331 of vectors in formula_265 converges absolutely if

formula_333

in which case all but at most countably many of the values formula_334 are necessarily zero.

If a countable series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of ).

=== Well-ordered sums ===
Conditionally convergent series can be considered if formula_203 is a well-ordered set, for example, an ordinal number formula_336
In this case, define by transfinite recursion:

formula_337

and for a limit ordinal formula_338

formula_339

if this limit exists. If all limits exist up to formula_340 then the series converges.

=== Examples ===
* Given a function formula_341 into an abelian topological group formula_342 define for every formula_343 formula_344 a function whose support is a singleton formula_345 Then formula_346 in the topology of pointwise convergence (that is, the sum is taken in the infinite product group formula_347).
* In the definition of partitions of unity, one constructs sums of functions over arbitrary index set formula_236 formula_349 While, formally, this requires a notion of sums of uncountable series, by construction there are, for every given formula_350 only finitely many nonzero terms in the sum, so issues regarding convergence of such sums do not arise. Actually, one usually assumes more: the family of functions is &quot;locally finite&quot;, that is, for every formula_200 there is a neighborhood of formula_200 in which all but a finite number of functions vanish. Any regularity property of the formula_353 such as continuity, differentiability, that is preserved under finite sums will be preserved for the sum of any subcollection of this family of functions.
* On the first uncountable ordinal formula_354 viewed as a topological space in the order topology, the constant function formula_355 given by formula_356 satisfies formula_357 (in other words, formula_354 copies of 1 is formula_354) only if one takes a limit over all &quot;countable&quot; partial sums, rather than finite partial sums. This space is not separable.

<text>In digital computers, an interrupt (sometimes referred to as a trap) is a request for the processor to &quot;interrupt&quot; currently executing code (when permitted), so that the event can be processed in a timely manner. If the request is accepted, the processor will suspend its current activities, save its state, and execute a function called an &quot;interrupt handler&quot; (or an &quot;interrupt service routine&quot;, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is often temporary, allowing the software to resume normal activities after the interrupt handler finishes, although the interrupt could instead indicate a fatal error.

Interrupts are commonly used by hardware devices to indicate electronic or physical state changes that require time-sensitive attention. Interrupts are also commonly used to implement computer multitasking and system calls, especially in real-time computing. Systems that use interrupts in these ways are said to be interrupt-driven.

==History==
Hardware interrupts were introduced as an optimization, eliminating unproductive waiting time in polling loops, waiting for external events. The first system to use this approach was the DYSEAC, completed in 1954, although earlier systems provided error trap functions.

The UNIVAC 1103A computer is generally credited with the earliest use of interrupts in 1953. Earlier, on the UNIVAC I (1951) &quot;Arithmetic overflow either triggered the execution of a two-instruction fix-up routine at address 0, or, at the programmer&#x27;s option, caused the computer to stop.&quot; The IBM 650 (1954) incorporated the first occurrence of interrupt masking. The National Bureau of Standards DYSEAC (1954) was the first to use interrupts for I/O. The IBM 704 was the first to use interrupts for debugging, with a &quot;transfer trap&quot;, which could invoke a special routine when a branch instruction was encountered. The MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 system (1957) was the first to provide multiple levels of priority interrupts.

==Types==

Interrupt signals may be issued in response to hardware or software events. These are classified as hardware interrupts or software interrupts, respectively. For any particular processor, the number of interrupt types is limited by the architecture.
===Hardware interrupts===
A hardware interrupt is a condition related to the state of the hardware that may be signaled by an external hardware device, e.g., an interrupt request (IRQ) line on a PC, or detected by devices embedded in processor logic (e.g., the CPU timer in IBM System/370), to communicate that the device needs attention from the operating system (OS) or, if there is no OS, from the bare metal program running on the CPU. Such external devices may be part of the computer (e.g., disk controller) or they may be external peripherals. For example, pressing a keyboard key or moving a mouse plugged into a PS/2 port triggers hardware interrupts that cause the processor to read the keystroke or mouse position.

Hardware interrupts can arrive asynchronously with respect to the processor clock, and at any time during instruction execution. Consequently, all incoming hardware interrupt signals are conditioned by synchronizing them to the processor clock, and acted upon only at instruction execution boundaries.

In many systems, each device is associated with a particular IRQ signal. This makes it possible to quickly determine which hardware device is requesting service, and to expedite servicing of that device.

On some older systems, such as the 1964 CDC 3600, all interrupts went to the same location, and the OS used a specialized instruction to determine the highest-priority outstanding unmasked interrupt. On contemporary systems, there is generally a distinct interrupt routine for each type of interrupt (or for each interrupt source), often implemented as one or more interrupt vector tables.

====Masking====
To &quot;mask&quot; an interrupt is to disable it, so it is deferred or ignored by the processor, while to &quot;unmask&quot; an interrupt is to enable it.

Processors typically have an internal &quot;interrupt mask&quot; register, which allows selective enabling (and disabling) of hardware interrupts. Each interrupt signal is associated with a bit in the mask register. On some systems, the interrupt is enabled when the bit is set, and disabled when the bit is clear. On others, the reverse is true, and a set bit disables the interrupt. When the interrupt is disabled, the associated interrupt signal may be ignored by the processor, or it may remain pending. Signals which are affected by the mask are called &quot;maskable interrupts&quot;.

Some interrupt signals are not affected by the interrupt mask and therefore cannot be disabled; these are called &quot;non-maskable interrupts&quot; (NMIs). These indicate high-priority events which cannot be ignored under any circumstances, such as the timeout signal from a watchdog timer. With regard to SPARC, the Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI), despite having the highest priority among interrupts, can be prevented from occurring through the use of an interrupt mask.

====Missing interrupts====
One failure mode is when the hardware does not generate the expected interrupt for a change in state, causing the operating system to wait indefinitely. Depending on the details, the failure might affect only a single process or might have global impact. Some operating systems have code specifically to deal with this.

As an example, IBM Operating System/360 (OS/360) relies on a not-ready to ready device-end interrupt when a tape has been mounted on a tape drive, and will not read the tape label until that interrupt occurs or is simulated. IBM added code in OS/360 so that the VARY ONLINE command will simulate a device end interrupt on the target device.

====Spurious interrupts====
A &quot;spurious interrupt&quot; is a hardware interrupt for which no source can be found. The term &quot;phantom interrupt&quot; or &quot;ghost interrupt&quot; may also be used to describe this phenomenon. Spurious interrupts tend to be a problem with a wired-OR interrupt circuit attached to a level-sensitive processor input. Such interrupts may be difficult to identify when a system misbehaves.

In a wired-OR circuit, parasitic capacitance charging/discharging through the interrupt line&#x27;s bias resistor will cause a small delay before the processor recognizes that the interrupt source has been cleared. If the interrupting device is cleared too late in the interrupt service routine (ISR), there will not be enough time for the interrupt circuit to return to the quiescent state before the current instance of the ISR terminates. The result is the processor will think another interrupt is pending, since the voltage at its interrupt request input will be not high or low enough to establish an unambiguous internal logic 1 or logic 0. The apparent interrupt will have no identifiable source, hence the &quot;spurious&quot; moniker.

A spurious interrupt may also be the result of electrical anomalies due to faulty circuit design, high noise levels, crosstalk, timing issues, or more rarely, device errata.

A spurious interrupt may result in system deadlock or other undefined operation if the ISR does not account for the possibility of such an interrupt occurring. As spurious interrupts are mostly a problem with wired-OR interrupt circuits, good programming practice in such systems is for the ISR to check all interrupt sources for activity and take no action (other than possibly logging the event) if none of the sources is interrupting.

===Software interrupts===
A software interrupt is requested by the processor itself upon executing particular instructions or when certain conditions are met. Every software interrupt signal is associated with a particular interrupt handler.

A software interrupt may be intentionally caused by executing a special instruction which, by design, invokes an interrupt when executed. Such instructions function similarly to subroutine calls and are used for a variety of purposes, such as requesting operating system services and interacting with device drivers (e.g., to read or write storage media). Software interrupts may also be triggered by program execution errors or by the virtual memory system.

Typically, the operating system kernel will catch and handle such interrupts. Some interrupts are handled transparently to the program - for example, the normal resolution of a page fault is to make the required page accessible in physical memory. But in other cases such as a segmentation fault the operating system executes a process callback. On Unix-like operating systems this involves sending a signal such as SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL or SIGFPE, which may either call a signal handler or execute a default action (terminating the program). On Windows the callback is made using Structured Exception Handling with an exception code such as STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION or STATUS_INTEGER_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.

In a kernel process, it is often the case that some types of software interrupts are not supposed to happen. If they occur nonetheless, an operating system crash may result.

===Terminology===
The terms &quot;interrupt&quot;, &quot;trap&quot;, &quot;exception&quot;, &quot;fault&quot;, and &quot;abort&quot; are used to distinguish types of interrupts, although &quot;there is no clear consensus as to the exact meaning of these terms&quot;. The term &quot;trap&quot; may refer to any interrupt, to any software interrupt, to any synchronous software interrupt, or only to interrupts caused by instructions with &quot;trap&quot; in their names. In some usages, the term &quot;trap&quot; refers specifically to a breakpoint intended to initiate a context switch to a monitor program or debugger. It may also refer to a synchronous interrupt caused by an exceptional condition (e.g., division by zero, invalid memory access, illegal opcode), although the term &quot;exception&quot; is more common for this.

x86 divides interrupts into (hardware) &quot;interrupts&quot; and software &quot;exceptions&quot;, and identifies three types of exceptions: faults, traps, and aborts. (Hardware) interrupts are interrupts triggered asynchronously by an I/O device, and allow the program to be restarted with no loss of continuity. A fault is restartable as well but is tied to the synchronous execution of an instruction - the return address points to the faulting instruction. A trap is similar to a fault except that the return address points to the instruction to be executed after the trapping instruction; one prominent use is to implement system calls. An abort is used for severe errors, such as hardware errors and illegal values in system tables, and often does not allow a restart of the program.

Arm uses the term &quot;exception&quot; to refer to all types of interrupts, and divides exceptions into (hardware) &quot;interrupts&quot;, &quot;aborts&quot;, &quot;reset&quot;, and exception-generating instructions. Aborts correspond to x86 exceptions and may be prefetch aborts (failed instruction fetches) or data aborts (failed data accesses), and may be synchronous or asynchronous. Asynchronous aborts may be precise or imprecise. MMU aborts (page faults) are synchronous.

RISC-V uses interrupt as the overall term as well as for the external subset; internal interrupts are called exceptions.

==Triggering methods==
Each interrupt signal input is designed to be triggered by either a logic signal level or a particular signal edge (level transition). Level-sensitive inputs continuously request processor service so long as a particular (high or low) logic level is applied to the input. Edge-sensitive inputs react to signal edges: a particular (rising or falling) edge will cause a service request to be latched; the processor resets the latch when the interrupt handler executes.

===Level-triggered===
A &quot;level-triggered interrupt&quot; is requested by holding the interrupt signal at its particular (high or low) active logic level. A device invokes a level-triggered interrupt by driving the signal to and holding it at the active level. It negates the signal when the processor commands it to do so, typically after the device has been serviced.

The processor samples the interrupt input signal during each instruction cycle. The processor will recognize the interrupt request if the signal is asserted when sampling occurs.

Level-triggered inputs allow multiple devices to share a common interrupt signal via wired-OR connections. The processor polls to determine which devices are requesting service. After servicing a device, the processor may again poll and, if necessary, service other devices before exiting the ISR.  As previously described, a processor whose level-sensitive interrupt input is connected to a wired-OR circuit is susceptible to spurious interrupts, which should they occur, may cause deadlock or some other potentially-fatal system fault.

===Edge-triggered===
An &quot;edge-triggered interrupt&quot; is an interrupt signaled by a level transition on the interrupt line, either a falling edge (high to low) or a rising edge (low to high). A device wishing to signal an interrupt drives a pulse onto the line and then releases the line to its inactive state. If the pulse is too short to be detected by polled I/O then special hardware may be required to detect it. The important part of edge triggering is that the signal must transition to trigger the interrupt; for example, if the signal was high-low-low, there would only be one falling edge interrupt triggered, and the continued low level would not trigger a further interrupt. The signal must return to the high level and fall again in order to trigger a further interrupt. This contrasts with a level trigger where the low level would continue to create interrupts (if they are enabled) until the signal returns to its high level.

Computers with edge-triggered interrupts may include an &quot;interrupt register&quot; that retains the status of pending interrupts. Systems with interrupt registers generally have interrupt mask registers as well.

==Processor response==
The processor samples the interrupt trigger signals or interrupt register during each instruction cycle, and will process the highest priority enabled interrupt found.
Regardless of the triggering method, the processor will begin interrupt processing at the next instruction boundary following a detected trigger, thus ensuring:
* The processor status is saved in a known manner. Typically the status is stored in a known location, but on some systems it is stored on a stack.
* All instructions before the one pointed to by the PC have fully executed.
* No instruction beyond the one pointed to by the PC has been executed, or any such instructions are undone before handling the interrupt.
* The execution state of the instruction pointed to by the PC is known.

There are several different architectures for handling interrupts. In some, there is a single interrupt handler that must scan for the highest priority enabled interrupt. In others, there are separate interrupt handlers for separate interrupt types, separate I/O channels or devices, or both. Several interrupt causes may have the same interrupt type and thus the same interrupt handler, requiring the interrupt handler to determine the cause.

==System implementation==
Interrupts may be fully handled in hardware by the CPU, or may be handled by both the CPU and another component such as a programmable interrupt controller or a southbridge.

If an additional component is used, that component would be connected between the interrupting device and the processor&#x27;s interrupt pin to multiplex several sources of interrupt onto the one or two CPU lines typically available. If implemented as part of the memory controller, interrupts are mapped into the system&#x27;s memory address space.

In systems on a chip (SoC) implementations, interrupts come from different blocks of the chip and are usually aggregated in an interrupt controller attached to one or several processors (in a multi-core system).

===Shared IRQs===
Multiple devices may share an edge-triggered interrupt line if they are designed to. The interrupt line must have a pull-down or pull-up resistor so that when not actively driven it settles to its inactive state, which is the default state of it. Devices signal an interrupt by briefly driving the line to its non-default state, and let the line float (do not actively drive it) when not signaling an interrupt. This type of connection is also referred to as open collector. The line then carries all the pulses generated by all the devices. (This is analogous to the pull cord on some buses and trolleys that any passenger can pull to signal the driver that they are requesting a stop.) However, interrupt pulses from different devices may merge if they occur close in time. To avoid losing interrupts the CPU must trigger on the trailing edge of the pulse (e.g. the rising edge if the line is pulled up and driven low). After detecting an interrupt the CPU must check all the devices for service requirements.

Edge-triggered interrupts do not suffer the problems that level-triggered interrupts have with sharing. Service of a low-priority device can be postponed arbitrarily, while interrupts from high-priority devices continue to be received and get serviced. If there is a device that the CPU does not know how to service, which may raise spurious interrupts, it will not interfere with interrupt signaling of other devices. However, it is easy for an edge-triggered interrupt to be missed - for example, when interrupts are masked for a period - and unless there is some type of hardware latch that records the event it is impossible to recover. This problem caused many &quot;lockups&quot; in early computer hardware because the processor did not know it was expected to do something. More modern hardware often has one or more interrupt status registers that latch interrupts requests; well-written edge-driven interrupt handling code can check these registers to ensure no events are missed.

The Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus uses edge-triggered interrupts, without mandating that devices be able to share IRQ lines, but all mainstream ISA motherboards include pull-up resistors on their IRQ lines, so well-behaved ISA devices sharing IRQ lines should just work fine. The parallel port also uses edge-triggered interrupts. Many older devices assume that they have exclusive use of IRQ lines, making it electrically unsafe to share them.

There are three ways multiple devices &quot;sharing the same line&quot; can be raised. First is by exclusive conduction (switching) or exclusive connection (to pins). Next is by bus (all connected to the same line listening): cards on a bus must know when they are to talk and not talk (i.e., the ISA bus). Talking can be triggered in two ways: by accumulation latch or by logic gates. Logic gates expect a continual data flow that is monitored for key signals. Accumulators only trigger when the remote side excites the gate beyond a threshold, thus no negotiated speed is required. Each has its speed versus distance advantages. A trigger, generally, is the method in which excitation is detected: rising edge, falling edge, threshold (oscilloscope can trigger a wide variety of shapes and conditions).

Triggering for software interrupts must be built into the software (both in OS and app). A &#x27;C&#x27; app has a trigger table (a table of functions) in its header, which both the app and OS know of and use appropriately that is not related to hardware. However do not confuse this with hardware interrupts which signal the CPU (the CPU enacts software from a table of functions, similarly to software interrupts).

====Difficulty with sharing interrupt lines====
Multiple devices sharing an interrupt line (of any triggering style) all act as spurious interrupt sources with respect to each other. With many devices on one line, the workload in servicing interrupts grows in proportion to the square of the number of devices. It is therefore preferred to spread devices evenly across the available interrupt lines. Shortage of interrupt lines is a problem in older system designs where the interrupt lines are distinct physical conductors. Message-signaled interrupts, where the interrupt line is virtual, are favored in new system architectures (such as PCI Express) and relieve this problem to a considerable extent.

Some devices with a poorly designed programming interface provide no way to determine whether they have requested service. They may lock up or otherwise misbehave if serviced when they do not want it. Such devices cannot tolerate spurious interrupts, and so also cannot tolerate sharing an interrupt line. ISA cards, due to often cheap design and construction, are notorious for this problem. Such devices are becoming much rarer, as hardware logic becomes cheaper and new system architectures mandate shareable interrupts.

===Hybrid===
Some systems use a hybrid of level-triggered and edge-triggered signaling. The hardware not only looks for an edge, but it also verifies that the interrupt signal stays active for a certain period of time.

A common use of a hybrid interrupt is for the NMI (non-maskable interrupt) input. Because NMIs generally signal major – or even catastrophic – system events, a good implementation of this signal tries to ensure that the interrupt is valid by verifying that it remains active for a period of time. This 2-step approach helps to eliminate false interrupts from affecting the system.

===Message-signaled===
A &quot;message-signaled interrupt&quot; does not use a physical interrupt line. Instead, a device signals its request for service by sending a short message over some communications medium, typically a computer bus. The message might be of a type reserved for interrupts, or it might be of some pre-existing type such as a memory write.

Message-signalled interrupts behave very much like edge-triggered interrupts, in that the interrupt is a momentary signal rather than a continuous condition. Interrupt-handling software treats the two in much the same manner. Typically, multiple pending message-signaled interrupts with the same message (the same virtual interrupt line) are allowed to merge, just as closely spaced edge-triggered interrupts can merge.

Message-signalled interrupt vectors can be shared, to the extent that the underlying communication medium can be shared. No additional effort is required.

Because the identity of the interrupt is indicated by a pattern of data bits, not requiring a separate physical conductor, many more distinct interrupts can be efficiently handled. This reduces the need for sharing. Interrupt messages can also be passed over a serial bus, not requiring any additional lines.

PCI Express, a serial computer bus, uses message-signaled interrupts exclusively.

===Doorbell===

In a push button analogy applied to computer systems, the term &quot;doorbell&quot; or &quot;doorbell interrupt&quot; is often used to describe a mechanism whereby a software system can signal or notify a computer hardware device that there is some work to be done. Typically, the software system will place data in some well-known and mutually agreed upon memory locations, and &quot;ring the doorbell&quot; by writing to a different memory location. This different memory location is often called the doorbell region, and there may even be multiple doorbells serving different purposes in this region. It is this act of writing to the doorbell region of memory that &quot;rings the bell&quot; and notifies the hardware device that the data are ready and waiting. The hardware device would now know that the data are valid and can be acted upon. It would typically write the data to a hard disk drive, or send them over a network, or encrypt them, etc.

The term &quot;doorbell interrupt&quot; is usually a misnomer. It is similar to an interrupt, because it causes some work to be done by the device; however, the doorbell region is sometimes implemented as a polled region, sometimes the doorbell region writes through to physical device registers, and sometimes the doorbell region is hardwired directly to physical device registers. When either writing through or directly to physical device registers, this may cause a real interrupt to occur at the device&#x27;s central processor unit (CPU), if it has one.

Doorbell interrupts can be compared to Message Signaled Interrupts, as they have some similarities.

===Multiprocessor IPI===
In multiprocessor systems, a processor may send an interrupt request to another processor via inter-processor interrupts (IPI).

==Performance==
Interrupts provide low overhead and good latency at low load, but degrade significantly at high interrupt rate unless care is taken to prevent several pathologies. The phenomenon where the overall system performance is severely hindered by excessive amounts of processing time spent handling interrupts is called an interrupt storm.

There are various forms of livelocks, when the system spends all of its time processing interrupts to the exclusion of other required tasks.
Under extreme conditions, a large number of interrupts (like very high network traffic) may completely stall the system. To avoid such problems, an operating system must schedule network interrupt handling as carefully as it schedules process execution.

With multi-core processors, additional performance improvements in interrupt handling can be achieved through receive-side scaling (RSS) when multiqueue NICs are used. Such NICs provide multiple receive queues associated to separate interrupts; by routing each of those interrupts to different cores, processing of the interrupt requests triggered by the network traffic received by a single NIC can be distributed among multiple cores. Distribution of the interrupts among cores can be performed automatically by the operating system, or the routing of interrupts (usually referred to as &quot;IRQ affinity&quot;) can be manually configured.

A purely software-based implementation of the receiving traffic distribution, known as &quot;receive packet steering&quot; (RPS), distributes received traffic among cores later in the data path, as part of the interrupt handler functionality. Advantages of RPS over RSS include no requirements for specific hardware, more advanced traffic distribution filters, and reduced rate of interrupts produced by a NIC. As a downside, RPS increases the rate of inter-processor interrupts (IPIs). &quot;Receive flow steering&quot; (RFS) takes the software-based approach further by accounting for application locality; further performance improvements are achieved by processing interrupt requests by the same cores on which particular network packets will be consumed by the targeted application.

==Typical uses==
Interrupts are commonly used to service hardware timers, transfer data to and from storage (e.g., disk I/O) and communication interfaces (e.g., UART, Ethernet), handle keyboard and mouse events, and to respond to any other time-sensitive events as required by the application system. Non-maskable interrupts are typically used to respond to high-priority requests such as watchdog timer timeouts, power-down signals and traps.

Hardware timers are often used to generate periodic interrupts. In some applications, such interrupts are counted by the interrupt handler to keep track of absolute or elapsed time, or used by the OS task scheduler to manage execution of running processes, or both. Periodic interrupts are also commonly used to invoke sampling from input devices such as analog-to-digital converters, incremental encoder interfaces, and GPIO inputs, and to program output devices such as digital-to-analog converters, motor controllers, and GPIO outputs.

A disk interrupt signals the completion of a data transfer from or to the disk peripheral; this may cause a process to run which is waiting to read or write. A power-off interrupt predicts imminent loss of power, allowing the computer to perform an orderly shut-down while there still remains enough power to do so. Keyboard interrupts typically cause keystrokes to be buffered so as to implement typeahead.

Interrupts are sometimes used to emulate instructions which are unimplemented on some computers in a product family. For example floating point instructions may be implemented in hardware on some systems and emulated on lower-cost systems. In the latter case, execution of an unimplemented floating point instruction will cause an &quot;illegal instruction&quot; exception interrupt. The interrupt handler will implement the floating point function in software and then return to the interrupted program as if the hardware-implemented instruction had been executed. This provides application software portability across the entire line.

Interrupts are similar to signals, the difference being that signals are used for inter-process communication (IPC), mediated by the kernel (possibly via system calls) and handled by processes, while interrupts are mediated by the processor and handled by the kernel. The kernel may pass an interrupt as a signal to the process that caused it (typical examples are SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGFPE).

<text>Intercalation or embolism in timekeeping is the insertion of a leap day, week, or month into some calendar years to make the calendar follow the seasons or moon phases. Lunisolar calendars may require intercalations of days or months.

== Solar calendars ==

The solar or tropical year does not have a whole number of days (it is about 365.24 days), but a calendar year must have a whole number of days. The most common way to reconcile the two is to vary the number of days in the calendar year.

In solar calendars, this is done by adding an extra day (&quot;leap day&quot; or &quot;intercalary day&quot;) to a common year of 365 days, about once every four years, creating a leap year that has 366 days (Julian, Gregorian and Indian national calendars).

The Decree of Canopus, issued by the pharaoh Ptolemy III Euergetes of Ancient Egypt in 239 BC, decreed a solar leap day system; an Egyptian leap year was not adopted until 25 BC, when the Roman Emperor Augustus instituted a reformed Alexandrian calendar.

In the Julian calendar, as well as in the Gregorian calendar, which improved upon it, intercalation is done by adding an extra day to February in each leap year. In the Julian calendar this was done every four years. In the Gregorian, years divisible by 100 but not 400 were exempted in order to improve accuracy. Thus, 2000 was a leap year; 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.

Epagomenal days are days within a solar calendar that are outside any regular month. Usually five epagomenal days are included within every year (Egyptian, Coptic, Ethiopian, Mayan Haab&#x27; and French Republican Calendars), but a sixth epagomenal day is intercalated every four years in some (Coptic, Ethiopian and French Republican calendars).

The Solar Hijri calendar, used in Iran, is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure, and hence the intercalation, with the exception that its epoch is the Hijrah.

The Bahá&#x27;í calendar includes enough epagomenal days (usually 4 or 5) before the last month (, &quot;ʿalāʾ&quot;) to ensure that the following year starts on the March equinox. These are known as the Ayyám-i-Há.

== Lunisolar calendars ==
The solar year does not have a whole number of lunar months (it is about 365/29.5 = 12.37 lunations), so a lunisolar calendar must have a variable number of months per year. Regular years have 12 months, but embolismic years insert a 13th &quot;intercalary&quot; or &quot;leap&quot; month or &quot;embolismic&quot; month every second or third year. Whether to insert an intercalary month in a given year may be determined using regular cycles such as the 19-year Metonic cycle (Hebrew calendar and in the determination of Easter) or using calculations of lunar phases (Hindu lunisolar and Chinese calendars). The Buddhist calendar adds both an intercalary day and month on a usually regular cycle.

== Lunar calendars ==

In principle, lunar calendars do not employ intercalation because they do not seek to synchronise with the seasons, and the motion of the moon is astronomically predictable. But religious lunar calendars rely on actual observation.

The Lunar Hijri calendar, the purely lunar calendar observed by most of Islam, depends on actual observation of the first crescent of the moon and thus has no intercalation. Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually no discernible order in the sequencing of 29- or 30-day month lengths. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the &quot;hilal&quot; (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the &quot;hilal&quot; is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. 

The tabular Islamic calendar, used in Iran, has 12 lunar months that usually alternate between 30 and 29 days every year, but an intercalary day is added to the last month of the year 12 times in a 33-year cycle. Some historians also linked the pre-Islamic practice of Nasi&#x27; to intercalation.

== Leap seconds ==
The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service can insert or remove leap seconds from the last day of any month (June and December are preferred). These are sometimes described as intercalary.

== Other uses ==
ISO 8601 includes a specification for a 52/53-week year. Any year that has 53 Thursdays has 53 weeks; this extra week may be regarded as intercalary.

The &quot;xiuhpōhualli&quot; (year count) system of the Aztec calendar had five intercalary days after the eighteenth and final month, the &quot;nēmontēmi&quot;, in which the people fasted and reflected on the past year.

<text>Ink is a gel, sol, or solution that contains at least one colorant, such as a dye or pigment, and is used to color a surface to produce an image, text, or design. Ink is used for drawing or writing with a pen, brush, reed pen, or quill. Thicker inks, in paste form, are used extensively in letterpress and lithographic printing.

Ink can be a complex medium, composed of solvents, pigments, dyes, resins, lubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, particulate matter, fluorescents, and other materials. The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink&#x27;s carrier, colorants, and other additives affect the flow and thickness of the ink and its dry appearance.

==History==

 Many ancient cultures around the world have independently discovered and formulated inks due to the need to write and draw. The recipes and techniques for the production of ink are derived from archaeological analyses or from written texts itself. The earliest inks from all civilizations are believed to have been made with &quot;lampblack&quot;, a kind of soot, easily collected as a by-product of fire.

Ink was used in Ancient Egypt for writing and drawing on papyrus from at least the 26th century BC. Egyptian red and black inks included iron and ocher as pigments, in addition to phosphate, sulfate, chloride, and carboxylate ions, with lead also used as a drier.

The earliest Chinese inks may date to four millennia ago, to the Chinese Neolithic Period. These included plant, animal, and mineral inks, based on such materials as graphite; these were ground with water and applied with ink brushes. Direct evidence for the earliest Chinese inks, similar to modern inksticks, is found around 256 BC, in the end of the Warring States period; being produced from soot and animal glue. The preferred inks for drawing or painting on paper or silk are produced from the resin of the pine trees between 50 and 100 years old. The Chinese inkstick is produced with a fish glue, whereas Japanese glue (膠 &quot;nikawa&quot;) is from cow or stag.

India ink was invented in China, though materials were often traded from India, hence the name. The traditional Chinese method of making the ink was to grind a mixture of hide glue, carbon black, lampblack, and bone black pigment with a pestle and mortar, then pour it into a ceramic dish to dry. To use the dry mixture, a wet brush would be applied until it reliquified. The manufacture of India ink was well-established by the Cao Wei dynasty (220–265 AD). Indian documents written in Kharosthi with ink have been unearthed in Xinjiang. The practice of writing with ink and a sharp pointed needle was common in early South India. Several Buddhist and Jain sutras in India were compiled in ink.

Cephalopod ink, known as sepia, turns from dark blue-black to brown on drying, and was used as an ink in the Graeco-Roman period and subsequently. Black atramentum was also used in ancient Rome; in an article for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Sharon J. Huntington describes these other historical inks:

About 1,600 years ago, a popular ink recipe was created. The recipe was used for centuries. Iron salts, such as ferrous sulfate (made by treating iron with sulfuric acid), were mixed with tannin from gallnuts (they grow on trees) and a thickener. When first put to paper, this ink is bluish-black. Over time it fades to a dull brown.

Scribes in medieval Europe (about AD 800 to 1500) wrote principally on parchment or vellum. One 12th century ink recipe called for hawthorn branches to be cut in the spring and left to dry. Then the bark was pounded from the branches and soaked in water for eight days. The water was boiled until it thickened and turned black. Wine was added during boiling. The ink was poured into special bags and hung in the sun. Once dried, the mixture was mixed with wine and iron salt over a fire to make the final ink.

The reservoir pen, which may have been the first fountain pen, dates back to 953, when Ma&#x27;ād al-Mu&#x27;izz, the caliph of Egypt, demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir.

In the 15th century, a new type of ink had to be developed in Europe for the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg. According to Martyn Lyons in his book &quot;Books: A Living History&quot;, Gutenberg&#x27;s dye was indelible, oil-based, and made from the soot of lamps (lamp-black) mixed with varnish and egg white. Two types of ink were prevalent at the time: the Greek and Roman writing ink (soot, glue, and water) and the 12th century variety composed of ferrous sulfate, gall, gum, and water. Neither of these handwriting inks could adhere to printing surfaces without creating blurs. Eventually an oily, varnish-like ink made of soot, turpentine, and walnut oil was created specifically for the printing press.

==Types==
Ink formulas vary, but commonly involve two components:
* Colorants
* Vehicles (binders)

Inks generally fall into four classes:
* Aqueous
* Liquid
* Paste
* Powder

===Colorants===
====Pigments====

Pigment inks are used more frequently than dyes because they are more color-fast, but they are also more expensive, less consistent in color, and have less of a color range than dyes.
Pigments are solid, opaque particles suspended in ink to provide color. Pigment molecules typically link together in crystalline structures that are 0.1–2 μm in size and comprise 5–30 percent of the ink volume. Qualities such as hue, saturation, and lightness vary depending on the source and type of pigment.Solvent-based inks are widely used for high-speed printing and applications that require quick drying times. And the inclusion of TiO2 powder provides superior coverage and vibrant colors.

====Dyes====
Dye-based inks are generally much stronger than pigment-based inks and can produce much more color of a given density per unit of mass. However, because dyes are dissolved in the liquid phase, they have a tendency to soak into paper, potentially allowing the ink to bleed at the edges of an image.

To circumvent this problem, dye-based inks are made with solvents that dry rapidly or are used with quick-drying methods of printing, such as blowing hot air on the fresh print. Other methods include harder paper sizing and more specialized paper coatings. The latter is particularly suited to inks used in non-industrial settings (which must conform to tighter toxicity and emission controls), such as inkjet printer inks. Another technique involves coating the paper with a charged coating. If the dye has the opposite charge, it is attracted to and retained by this coating, while the solvent soaks into the paper. Cellulose, the wood-derived material most paper is made of, is naturally charged, and so a compound that complexes with both the dye and the paper&#x27;s surface aids retention at the surface. Such a compound is commonly used in ink-jet printing inks.

An additional advantage of dye-based ink systems is that the dye molecules can interact with other ink ingredients, potentially allowing greater benefit as compared to pigmented inks from optical brighteners and color-enhancing agents designed to increase the intensity and appearance of dyes.

Dye-based inks can be used for anti-counterfeit purposes and can be found in some gel inks, fountain pen inks, and inks used for paper currency. These inks react with cellulose to bring about a permanent color change. Dye based inks are used to color hair.

==Health and environmental aspects==
There is a misconception that ink is non-toxic even if swallowed. Once ingested, ink can be hazardous to one&#x27;s health. Certain inks, such as those used in digital printers, and even those found in a common pen can be harmful. Though ink does not easily cause death, repeated skin contact or ingestion can cause effects such as severe headaches, skin irritation, or nervous system damage. These effects can be caused by solvents, or by pigment ingredients such as &quot;p&quot;-Anisidine, which helps create some inks&#x27; color and shine.

Three main environmental issues with ink are:
* Heavy metals
* Non-renewable oils
* Volatile organic compounds

Some regulatory bodies have set standards for the amount of heavy metals in ink. There is a trend toward vegetable oils rather than petroleum oils in recent years in response to a demand for better environmental sustainability performance.

Ink uses up non-renewable oils and metals, which has a negative impact on the environment.

===Carbon===

Carbon inks were commonly made from lampblack or soot and a binding agent such as gum arabic or animal glue. The binding agent keeps carbon particles in suspension and adhered to paper. Carbon particles do not fade over time even when bleached or when in sunlight. One benefit is that carbon ink does not harm paper. Over time, the ink is chemically stable and therefore does not threaten the paper&#x27;s strength. Despite these benefits, carbon ink is not ideal for permanence and ease of preservation. Carbon ink tends to smudge in humid environments and can be washed off surfaces. The best method of preserving a document written in carbon ink is to store it in a dry environment (Barrow 1972).

Recently, carbon inks made from carbon nanotubes have been successfully created. They are similar in composition to traditional inks in that they use a polymer to suspend the carbon nanotubes. These inks can be used in inkjet printers and produce electrically conductive patterns.

===Iron gall (common ink)===

Iron gall inks became prominent in the early 12th century; they were used for centuries and were widely thought to be the best type of ink. However, iron gall ink is corrosive and damages paper over time (Waters 1940). Items containing this ink can become brittle and the writing fades to brown. The original scores of Johann Sebastian Bach are threatened by the destructive properties of iron gall ink. The majority of his works are held by the German State Library, and about 25% of those are in advanced stages of decay (American Libraries 2000). The rate at which the writing fades is based on several factors, such as proportions of ink ingredients, amount deposited on the paper, and paper composition (Barrow 1972:16). Corrosion is caused by acid catalyzed hydrolysis and iron(II)-catalysed oxidation of cellulose (Rouchon-Quillet 2004:389).

Treatment is a controversial subject. No treatment undoes damage already caused by acidic ink. Deterioration can only be stopped or slowed. Some think it best not to treat the item at all for fear of the consequences. Others believe that non-aqueous procedures are the best solution. Yet others think an aqueous procedure may preserve items written with iron gall ink. Aqueous treatments include distilled water at different temperatures, calcium hydroxide, calcium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium bicarbonate, and calcium hyphenate. There are many possible side effects from these treatments. There can be mechanical damage, which further weakens the paper. Paper color or ink color may change, and ink may bleed. Other consequences of aqueous treatment are a change of ink texture or formation of plaque on the surface of the ink (Reibland &amp; de Groot 1999).

Iron gall inks require storage in a stable environment, because fluctuating relative humidity increases the rate that formic acid, acetic acid, and furan derivatives form in the material the ink was used on. Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst to cellulose hydrolysis, and iron (II) sulfate acts as a catalyst to cellulose oxidation. These chemical reactions physically weaken the paper, causing brittleness.

==Indelible ink==
&quot;Indelible&quot; means &quot;un-removable&quot;. Some types of indelible ink have a very short shelf life because of the quickly evaporating solvents used. India, Mexico, Indonesia, Malaysia and other developing countries have used indelible ink in the form of electoral stain to prevent electoral fraud. Election ink based on silver nitrate was first applied in the 1962 Indian general election, after being developed at the National Physical Laboratory of India.

The election commission in India has used indelible ink for many elections. Indonesia used it in its election in 2014. In Mali, the ink is applied to the fingernail. The technique is not infallible and can itself be used in other types of fraud, as rather than bolstering one&#x27;s own votes it can be used to eliminate opponent voters by marking them before they have chances to cast their votes. There are also reports of &quot;indelible&quot; ink washing off voters&#x27; fingers in Afghanistan.

<text>The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT; ) is a federal territory of Pakistan, centred around Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. It is located on the northern edge of the Pothohar Plateau, at the foot of the Margalla Hills, in the northwest of the Punjab region. The Territory shares borders with the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the west and the province of Punjab in the remaining directions. It covers an area of and, according to 2023 census, has a population of over 2.3 million.

The area was separated from Rawalpindi District in 1967 to form a separate territory administered by the federal government. The territory is represented in the National Assembly by NA-52, NA-53, and NA-54 constituencies and by four seats in the Senate.

==History==

In 1960, land was transferred from Rawalpindi District of Punjab province to replace Karachi Federal Capital Territory and establish Pakistan&#x27;s new capital. According to the 1960s master plan, the Capital Territory included Rawalpindi, and was to be composed of the following parts:
* Rawalpindi, 
* Islamabad Urban, 
* Margalla Hills, 
* Islamabad Rural, 

However, Rawalpindi was eventually excluded from the Islamabad master plan in the 1980s.

==Geography==

The Islamabad Capital Territory is composed of eight types of areas: administrative, commercial, diplomatic, educational, green, industrial, residential, and rural.

===Zones===

The territory is divided into five zones in two groups:
*Zone I: for urban development and federal government institutions
*Zone II: for urban development
*Zone III: for rural development
*Zone IV: for rural development
*Zone V: for rural development

Zone I consists mainly of all the developed residential sectors, while Zone II consists of the under-developed residential sectors. Each residential sector is identified by a letter of the alphabet and a number, and covers an area of approximately 4 square kilometres. The sectors are lettered from A to I, and each sector is divided into four numbered sub-sectors. Zone IV is the largest in area.

===Sectors===

Series A, B, and C are still underdeveloped. The D series has seven sectors (D-11 to D-17), of which only sector D-12 is completely developed. This series is located at the foot of Margalla Hills. The E Sectors are named from E-7 to E-17. Many foreigners and diplomatic personnel are housed in these sectors. In the revised Master Plan of the city, CDA has decided to develop a park on the pattern of Fatima Jinnah Park in sector E-14. Sectors E-8 and E-9 contain the campuses of Bahria University, Air University, and the National Defence University. The F and G series contains the most developed sectors. F series contains sectors F-5 to F-17; some sectors are still under-developed. F-5 is an important sector for the software industry in Islamabad, as the two software technology parks are located here. The entire F-9 sector is covered with Fatima Jinnah Park. The Centaurus complex will be one of the major landmarks of the F-8 sector. G sectors are numbered G-5 through G-17. Some important places include the Jinnah Convention Center and Serena Hotel in G-5, the Red Mosque in G-6, and the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, the largest medical complex in the capital, located in G-8.

The H sectors are numbered H-8 through H-17. The H sectors are mostly dedicated to educational and health institutions. National University of Sciences and Technology covers a major portion of sector H-12. The I sectors are numbered from I-8 to I-18. With the exception of I-8, which is a well-developed residential area, these sectors are primarily part of the industrial zone. Currently two sub-sectors of I-9 and one sub-sector of I-10 are used as industrial areas. CDA is planning to set up Islamabad Railway Station in Sector I-18 and Industrial City in sector I-17. Zone III consists primarily of the Margalla Hills and Margalla Hills National Park. Rawal Lake is in this zone. Zone IV and V consist of Islamabad Park, and rural areas of the city. The Soan River flows into the city through Zone V.

<doc id="15295" wikidata="Q172618" url="?curid=15295" title="Intelligent design">
<text>Intelligent design (ID) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God, presented by its proponents as &quot;an evidence-based scientific theory about life&#x27;s origins&quot;. Proponents claim that &quot;certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.&quot; ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses, and is therefore not science. The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute, a Christian, politically conservative think tank based in the United States.

Although the phrase &quot;intelligent design&quot; had featured previously in theological discussions of the argument from design, its first publication in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;, a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes. The term was substituted into drafts of the book, directly replacing references to &quot;creation science&quot; and &quot;creationism&quot;, after the 1987 Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; decision barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds. From the mid-1990s, the intelligent design movement (IDM), supported by the Discovery Institute, advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula. This led to the 2005 &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; trial, which found that intelligent design was not science, that it &quot;cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents&quot;, and that the public school district&#x27;s promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations: irreducible complexity and specified complexity, asserting that certain biological and informational features of living things are too complex to be the result of natural selection. Detailed scientific examination has rebutted several examples for which evolutionary explanations are claimed to be impossible.

ID seeks to challenge the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science, though proponents concede that they have yet to produce a scientific theory. As a positive argument against evolution, ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts, a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God. ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features, as defined by ID, are evidence of design. Critics of ID find a false dichotomy in the premise that evidence against evolution constitutes evidence for design.

==History==

===Origin of the concept===

In 1910, evolution was not a topic of major religious controversy in America, but in the 1920s, the fundamentalist–modernist controversy in theology resulted in fundamentalist Christian opposition to teaching evolution and resulted in the origins of modern creationism. As a result, teaching of evolution was effectively suspended in U.S. public schools until the 1960s, and when evolution was then reintroduced into the curriculum, there was a series of court cases in which attempts were made to get creationism taught alongside evolution in science classes. Young Earth creationists (YECs) promoted &quot;creation science&quot; as &quot;an alternative scientific explanation of the world in which we live&quot;. This frequently invoked the argument from design to explain complexity in nature as supposedly demonstrating the existence of God.

The argument from design, also known as the teleological argument or &quot;argument from intelligent design&quot;, has been presented by theologists for centuries. Thomas Aquinas presented ID in his fifth proof of God&#x27;s existence as a syllogism. In 1802, William Paley&#x27;s &quot;Natural Theology&quot; presented examples of intricate purpose in organisms. His version of the watchmaker analogy argued that a watch has evidently been designed by a craftsman and that it is supposedly just as evident that the complexity and adaptation seen in nature must have been designed. He went on to argue that the perfection and diversity of these designs supposedly shows the designer to be omnipotent and that this can supposedly only be the Christian god. Like &quot;creation science&quot;, intelligent design centers on Paley&#x27;s religious argument from design, but while Paley&#x27;s natural theology was open to deistic design through God-given laws, intelligent design seeks scientific confirmation of repeated supposedly miraculous interventions in the history of life. &quot;Creation science&quot; prefigured the intelligent design arguments of irreducible complexity, even featuring the bacterial flagellum. In the United States, attempts to introduce &quot;creation science&quot; into schools led to court rulings that it is religious in nature and thus cannot be taught in public school science classrooms. Intelligent design is also presented as science and shares other arguments with &quot;creation science&quot; but avoids literal Biblical references to such topics as the biblical flood story or using Bible verses to estimate the age of the Earth.

Barbara Forrest writes that the intelligent design movement began in 1984 with the book &quot;The Mystery of Life&#x27;s Origin: Reassessing Current Theories&quot;, co-written by the creationist and chemist Charles B. Thaxton and two other authors and published by Jon A. Buell&#x27;s Foundation for Thought and Ethics.

In March 1986, Stephen C. Meyer published a review of this book, discussing how information theory could suggest that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell show &quot;specified complexity&quot; and must have been created by an intelligent agent. He also argued that science is based upon &quot;foundational assumptions&quot; of naturalism that were as much a matter of faith as those of &quot;creation theory&quot;. In November of that year, Thaxton described his reasoning as a more sophisticated form of Paley&#x27;s argument from design. At a conference that Thaxton held in 1988 (&quot;Sources of Information Content in DNA&quot;), he said that his intelligent cause view was compatible with both metaphysical naturalism and supernaturalism.

Intelligent design avoids identifying or naming the intelligent designer—it merely states that one (or more) must exist—but leaders of the movement have said the designer is the Christian God. Whether this lack of specificity about the designer&#x27;s identity in public discussions is a genuine feature of the concept – or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science – has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.

===Origin of the term===
Since the Middle Ages, discussion of the religious &quot;argument from design&quot; or &quot;teleological argument&quot; in theology, with its concept of &quot;intelligent design&quot;, has persistently referred to the theistic Creator God. Although ID proponents chose this provocative label for their proposed alternative to evolutionary explanations, they have de-emphasized their religious antecedents and denied that ID is natural theology, while still presenting ID as supporting the argument for the existence of God.

While intelligent design proponents have pointed out past examples of the phrase &quot;intelligent design&quot; that they said were not creationist and faith-based, they have failed to show that these usages had any influence on those who introduced the label in the intelligent design movement.

Variations on the phrase appeared in Young Earth creationist publications: a 1967 book co-written by Percival Davis referred to &quot;design according to which basic organisms were created&quot;. In 1970, A. E. Wilder-Smith published &quot;The Creation of Life: A Cybernetic Approach to Evolution&quot;. The book defended Paley&#x27;s design argument with computer calculations of the improbability of genetic sequences, which he said could not be explained by evolution but required &quot;the abhorred necessity of divine intelligent activity behind nature&quot;, and that &quot;the same problem would be expected to beset the relationship between the designer behind nature and the intelligently designed part of nature known as man.&quot; In a 1984 article as well as in his affidavit to &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot;, Dean H. Kenyon defended creation science by stating that &quot;biomolecular systems require intelligent design and engineering know-how&quot;, citing Wilder-Smith. Creationist Richard B. Bliss used the phrase &quot;creative design&quot; in &quot;Origins: Two Models: Evolution, Creation&quot; (1976), and in &quot;Origins: Creation or Evolution&quot; (1988) wrote that &quot;while evolutionists are trying to find non-intelligent ways for life to occur, the creationist insists that an intelligent design must have been there in the first place.&quot;

====&quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;====
The most common modern use of the words &quot;intelligent design&quot; as a term intended to describe a field of inquiry began after the United States Supreme Court ruled in June 1987 in the case of &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; that it is unconstitutional for a state to require the teaching of creationism in public school science curricula.

A Discovery Institute report says that Charles B. Thaxton, editor of &quot;Pandas&quot;, had picked the phrase up from a NASA scientist. In two successive 1987 drafts of the book, over one hundred uses of the root word &quot;creation&quot;, such as &quot;creationism&quot; and &quot;Creation Science&quot;, were changed, almost without exception, to &quot;intelligent design&quot;, while &quot;creationists&quot; was changed to &quot;design proponents&quot; or, in one instance, &quot;cdesign proponentsists&quot;. In June 1988, Thaxton held a conference titled &quot;Sources of Information Content in DNA&quot; in Tacoma, Washington. Stephen C. Meyer was at the conference, and later recalled that &quot;The term &quot;intelligent design&quot; came up...&quot; In December 1988 Thaxton decided to use the label &quot;intelligent design&quot; for his new creationist movement.

&quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; was published in 1989, and in addition to including all the current arguments for ID, was the first book to make systematic use of the terms &quot;intelligent design&quot; and &quot;design proponents&quot; as well as the phrase &quot;design theory&quot;, defining the term &quot;intelligent design&quot; in a glossary and representing it as not being creationism. It thus represents the start of the modern intelligent design movement. &quot;Intelligent design&quot; was the most prominent of around fifteen new terms it introduced as a new lexicon of creationist terminology to oppose evolution without using religious language. It was the first place where the phrase &quot;intelligent design&quot; appeared in its primary present use, as stated both by its publisher Jon A. Buell, and by William A. Dembski in his expert witness report for &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;.

The National Center for Science Education (NCSE) has criticized the book for presenting all of the basic arguments of intelligent design proponents and being actively promoted for use in public schools before any research had been done to support these arguments. Although presented as a scientific textbook, philosopher of science Michael Ruse considers the contents &quot;worthless and dishonest&quot;. An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer described it as a political tool aimed at students who did not &quot;know science or understand the controversy over evolution and creationism&quot;. One of the authors of the science framework used by California schools, Kevin Padian, condemned it for its &quot;sub-text&quot;, &quot;intolerance for honest science&quot; and &quot;incompetence&quot;.

==Concepts==

===Irreducible complexity===
The term &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; was introduced by biochemist Michael Behe in his 1996 book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Black Box&quot;, though he had already described the concept in his contributions to the 1993 revised edition of &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;. Behe defines it as &quot;a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning&quot;.

Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap consists of several interacting pieces—the base, the catch, the spring and the hammer—all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems, because the selectable function is present only when all parts are assembled. Behe argued that irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include the bacterial flagellum of &quot;E. coli&quot;, the blood clotting cascade, cilia, and the adaptive immune system.

Critics point out that the irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary and therefore could not have been added sequentially. They argue that something that is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary as other components change. Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system, rather than by adding them. This is sometimes called the &quot;scaffolding objection&quot; by an analogy with scaffolding, which can support an &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; building until it is complete and able to stand on its own.
In the case of Behe&#x27;s mousetrap analogy, it has been shown that a mousetrap can be created with increasingly fewer parts and that even a single part is sufficient.

Behe has acknowledged using &quot;sloppy prose&quot;, and that his &quot;argument against Darwinism does not add up to a logical proof.&quot; Irreducible complexity has remained a popular argument among advocates of intelligent design; in the Dover trial, the court held that &quot;Professor Behe&#x27;s claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large.&quot;

===Specified complexity===

In 1986, Charles B. Thaxton, a physical chemist and creationist, used the term &quot;specified complexity&quot; from information theory when claiming that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell were specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.
The intelligent design concept of &quot;specified complexity&quot; was developed in the 1990s by mathematician, philosopher, and theologian William A. Dembski. Dembski states that when something exhibits specified complexity (i.e., is both complex and &quot;specified&quot;, simultaneously), one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. He provides the following examples: &quot;A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A Shakespearean sonnet is both complex and specified.&quot; He states that details of living things can be similarly characterized, especially the &quot;patterns&quot; of molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as DNA.
Dembski defines complex specified information (CSI) as anything with a less than 1 in 10150 chance of occurring by (natural) chance. Critics say that this renders the argument a tautology: complex specified information cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the real question becomes whether or not CSI actually exists in nature.

The conceptual soundness of Dembski&#x27;s specified complexity/CSI argument has been discredited in the scientific and mathematical communities. Specified complexity has yet to be shown to have wide applications in other fields, as Dembski asserts. John Wilkins and Wesley R. Elsberry characterize Dembski&#x27;s &quot;explanatory filter&quot; as &quot;eliminative&quot; because it eliminates explanations sequentially: first regularity, then chance, finally defaulting to design. They argue that this procedure is flawed as a model for scientific inference because the asymmetric way it treats the different possible explanations renders it prone to making false conclusions.

Richard Dawkins, evolutionary biologist and religion critic, argues in &quot;The God Delusion&quot; (2006) that allowing for an intelligent designer to account for unlikely complexity only postpones the problem, as such a designer would need to be at least as complex. Other scientists have argued that evolution through selection is better able to explain the observed complexity, as is evident from the use of selective evolution to design certain electronic, aeronautic and automotive systems that are considered problems too complex for human &quot;intelligent designers&quot;.

===Fine-tuned universe===

Intelligent design proponents have also occasionally appealed to broader teleological arguments outside of biology, most notably an argument based on the fine-tuning of universal constants that make matter and life possible and that are argued not to be solely attributable to chance. These include the values of fundamental physical constants, the relative strength of nuclear forces, electromagnetism, and gravity between fundamental particles, as well as the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent and Center for Science and Culture fellow Guillermo Gonzalez argues that if any of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically different, making it impossible for many chemical elements and features of the Universe, such as galaxies, to form. Thus, proponents argue, an intelligent designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features were present to achieve that particular outcome.

Scientists have generally responded that these arguments are poorly supported by existing evidence. Victor J. Stenger and other critics say both intelligent design and the weak form of the anthropic principle are essentially a tautology; in his view, these arguments amount to the claim that life is able to exist because the Universe is able to support life. The claim of the improbability of a life-supporting universe has also been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination for assuming no other forms of life are possible: life as we know it might not exist if things were different, but a different sort of life might exist in its place. A number of critics also suggest that many of the stated variables appear to be interconnected and that calculations made by mathematicians and physicists suggest that the emergence of a universe similar to ours is quite probable.

The contemporary intelligent design movement formulates its arguments in secular terms and intentionally avoids identifying the intelligent agent (or agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in &quot;The Design Inference&quot; (1998), speculates that an alien culture could fulfill these requirements. &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; proposes that SETI illustrates an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000, philosopher of science Robert T. Pennock suggested the Raëlian UFO religion as a real-life example of an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that &quot;make[s] many of the same bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists&quot;. The authoritative description of intelligent design, however, explicitly states that the &quot;Universe&quot; displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging the paradox, Dembski concludes that &quot;no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life.&quot; The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the Christian God, to the exclusion of all other religions.

Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, Jerry Coyne asks why a designer would &quot;give us a pathway for making vitamin C, but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes&quot; (see pseudogene) and why a designer would not &quot;stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species&quot;. Coyne also points to the fact that &quot;the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different&quot; as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer. Previously, in &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Black Box&quot;, Behe had argued that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer&#x27;s motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, &quot;...have been placed there by the designer for a reason—for artistic reasons, for variety, to show off, for some as-yet-undetected practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason—or they might not.&quot; Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, &quot;either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved.&quot;

Intelligent design proponents such as Paul Nelson avoid the problem of poor design in nature by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs from Paley&#x27;s expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He says that &quot;Another problem with the argument from imperfection is that it critically depends on a psychoanalysis of the unidentified designer. Yet the reasons that a designer would or would not do anything are virtually impossible to know unless the designer tells you specifically what those reasons are.&quot; This reliance on inexplicable motives of the designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable. Retired UC Berkeley law professor, author and intelligent design advocate Phillip E. Johnson puts forward a core definition that the designer creates for a purpose, giving the example that in his view AIDS was created to punish immorality and is not caused by HIV, but such motives cannot be tested by scientific methods.

Asserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question &quot;What designed the designer?&quot; Intelligent design proponents say that the question is irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design. Richard Wein counters that &quot;...scientific explanations often create new unanswered questions. But, in assessing the value of an explanation, these questions are not irrelevant. They must be balanced against the improvements in our understanding which the explanation provides. Invoking an unexplained being to explain the origin of other beings (ourselves) is little more than question-begging. The new question raised by the explanation is as problematic as the question which the explanation purports to answer.&quot; Richard Dawkins sees the assertion that the designer does not need to be explained as a thought-terminating cliché. In the absence of observable, measurable evidence, the question &quot;What designed the designer?&quot; leads to an infinite regression from which intelligent design proponents can only escape by resorting to religious creationism or logical contradiction.

==Movement==

The intelligent design movement is a direct outgrowth of the creationism of the 1980s. The scientific and academic communities, along with a U.S. federal court, view intelligent design as either a form of creationism or as a direct descendant that is closely intertwined with traditional creationism; and several authors explicitly refer to it as &quot;intelligent design creationism&quot;.

The movement is headquartered in the Center for Science and Culture, established in 1996 as the creationist wing of the Discovery Institute to promote a religious agenda calling for broad social, academic and political changes. The Discovery Institute&#x27;s intelligent design campaigns have been staged primarily in the United States, although efforts have been made in other countries to promote intelligent design. Leaders of the movement say intelligent design exposes the limitations of scientific orthodoxy and of the secular philosophy of naturalism. Intelligent design proponents allege that science should not be limited to naturalism and should not demand the adoption of a naturalistic philosophy that dismisses out-of-hand any explanation that includes a supernatural cause. The overall goal of the movement is to &quot;reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview&quot; represented by the theory of evolution in favor of &quot;a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions&quot;.

Phillip E. Johnson stated that the goal of intelligent design is to cast creationism as a scientific concept. All leading intelligent design proponents are fellows or staff of the Discovery Institute and its Center for Science and Culture. Nearly all intelligent design concepts and the associated movement are the products of the Discovery Institute, which guides the movement and follows its wedge strategy while conducting its &quot;teach the controversy&quot; campaign and their other related programs.

Leading intelligent design proponents have made conflicting statements regarding intelligent design. In statements directed at the general public, they say intelligent design is not religious; when addressing conservative Christian supporters, they state that intelligent design has its foundation in the Bible. Recognizing the need for support, the Institute affirms its Christian, evangelistic orientation:

Barbara Forrest, an expert who has written extensively on the movement, describes this as being due to the Discovery Institute&#x27;s obfuscating its agenda as a matter of policy. She has written that the movement&#x27;s &quot;activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious worldview that undergirds it.&quot;

===Religion and leading proponents===
Although arguments for intelligent design by the intelligent design movement are formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer, the majority of principal intelligent design advocates are publicly religious Christians who have stated that, in their view, the designer proposed in intelligent design is the Christian conception of God. Stuart Burgess, Phillip E. Johnson, William A. Dembski, and Stephen C. Meyer are evangelical Protestants; Michael Behe is a Roman Catholic; Paul Nelson supports young Earth creationism; and Jonathan Wells is a member of the Unification Church. Non-Christian proponents include David Klinghoffer, who is Jewish, Michael Denton and David Berlinski, who are agnostic, and Muzaffar Iqbal, a Pakistani-Canadian Muslim. Phillip E. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments that are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of theistic creationism is a necessary first step for ultimately reintroducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design identified &quot;as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message.&quot; Johnson emphasizes that &quot;...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact.&quot;

The strategy of deliberately disguising the religious intent of intelligent design has been described by William A. Dembski in &quot;The Design Inference&quot;. In this work, Dembski lists a god or an &quot;alien life force&quot; as two possible options for the identity of the designer; however, in his book &quot;Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology&quot; (1999), Dembski states:

Dembski also stated, &quot;ID is part of God&#x27;s general revelation ... Not only does intelligent design rid us of this ideology [materialism], which suffocates the human spirit, but, in my personal experience, I&#x27;ve found that it opens the path for people to come to Christ.&quot; Both Johnson and Dembski cite the Bible&#x27;s Gospel of John as the foundation of intelligent design.

Barbara Forrest contends such statements reveal that leading proponents see intelligent design as essentially religious in nature, not merely a scientific concept that has implications with which their personal religious beliefs happen to coincide. She writes that the leading proponents of intelligent design are closely allied with the ultra-conservative Christian Reconstructionism movement. She lists connections of (current and former) Discovery Institute Fellows Phillip E. Johnson, Charles B. Thaxton, Michael Behe, Richard Weikart, Jonathan Wells and Francis J. Beckwith to leading Christian Reconstructionist organizations, and the extent of the funding provided the Institute by Howard Ahmanson, Jr., a leading figure in the Reconstructionist movement.

===Reaction from other creationist groups===
Not all creationist organizations have embraced the intelligent design movement. According to Thomas Dixon, &quot;Religious leaders have come out against ID too. An open letter affirming the compatibility of Christian faith and the teaching of evolution, first produced in response to controversies in Wisconsin in 2004, has now been signed by over ten thousand clergy from different Christian denominations across America.&quot; Hugh Ross of Reasons to Believe, a proponent of Old Earth creationism, believes that the efforts of intelligent design proponents to divorce the concept from Biblical Christianity make its hypothesis too vague. In 2002, he wrote: &quot;Winning the argument for design without identifying the designer yields, at best, a sketchy origins model. Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the community of scientists and other scholars. ... the time is right for a direct approach, a single leap into the origins fray. Introducing a biblically based, scientifically verifiable creation model represents such a leap.&quot;

Likewise, two of the most prominent YEC organizations in the world have attempted to distinguish their views from those of the intelligent design movement. Henry M. Morris of the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) wrote, in 1999, that ID, &quot;even if well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work! It has often been tried in the past and has failed, and it will fail today. The reason it won&#x27;t work is because it is not the Biblical method.&quot; According to Morris: &quot;The evidence of intelligent design ... must be either followed by or accompanied by a sound presentation of true Biblical creationism if it is to be meaningful and lasting.&quot; In 2002, Carl Wieland, then of Answers in Genesis (AiG), criticized design advocates who, though well-intentioned, &quot;&#x27;left the Bible out of it&#x27;&quot; and thereby unwittingly aided and abetted the modern rejection of the Bible. Wieland explained that &quot;AiG&#x27;s major &#x27;strategy&#x27; is to boldly, but humbly, call the church back to its Biblical foundations ... [so] we neither count ourselves a part of this movement nor campaign against it.&quot;

===Reaction from the scientific community===
The unequivocal consensus in the scientific community is that intelligent design is not science and has no place in a science curriculum. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has stated that &quot;creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science.&quot; The U.S. National Science Teachers Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have termed it pseudoscience. Others in the scientific community have denounced its tactics, accusing the ID movement of manufacturing false attacks against evolution, of engaging in misinformation and misrepresentation about science, and marginalizing those who teach it. More recently, in September 2012, Bill Nye warned that creationist views threaten science education and innovations in the United States.

In 2001, the Discovery Institute published advertisements under the heading &quot;A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism&quot;, with the claim that listed scientists had signed this statement expressing skepticism:

The ambiguous statement did not exclude other known evolutionary mechanisms, and most signatories were not scientists in relevant fields, but starting in 2004 the Institute claimed the increasing number of signatures indicated mounting doubts about evolution among scientists. The statement formed a key component of Discovery Institute campaigns to present intelligent design as scientifically valid by claiming that evolution lacks broad scientific support, with Institute members continuing to cite the list through at least 2011. As part of a strategy to counter these claims, scientists organised Project Steve, which gained more signatories named Steve (or variants) than the Institute&#x27;s petition, and a counter-petition, &quot;A Scientific Support for Darwinism&quot;, which quickly gained similar numbers of signatories.

===Polls===
Several surveys were conducted prior to the December 2005 decision in &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover School District&quot;, which sought to determine the level of support for intelligent design among certain groups. According to a 2005 Harris poll, 10% of adults in the United States viewed human beings as &quot;so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them.&quot; Although Zogby polls commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls suffer from considerable flaws, such as having a low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing leading questions.

A series of Gallup polls in the United States from 1982 through 2014 on &quot;Evolution, Creationism, Intelligent Design&quot; found support for &quot;human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced formed of life, but God guided the process&quot; of between 31% and 40%, support for &quot;God created human beings in pretty much their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so&quot; varied from 40% to 47%, and support for &quot;human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in the process&quot; varied from 9% to 19%. The polls also noted answers to a series of more detailed questions.
The 2017 Gallup creationism survey found that 38% of adults in the United States hold the view that &quot;God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years&quot; when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which was noted as being at the lowest level in 35 years.

===Allegations of discrimination against ID proponents===
There have been allegations that ID proponents have met discrimination, such as being refused tenure or being harshly criticized on the Internet. In the documentary film &quot;&quot;, released in 2008, host Ben Stein presents five such cases. The film contends that the mainstream science establishment, in a &quot;scientific conspiracy to keep God out of the nation&#x27;s laboratories and classrooms&quot;, suppresses academics who believe they see evidence of intelligent design in nature or criticize evidence of evolution. Investigation into these allegations turned up alternative explanations for perceived persecution.

The film portrays intelligent design as motivated by science, rather than religion, though it does not give a detailed definition of the phrase or attempt to explain it on a scientific level. Other than briefly addressing issues of irreducible complexity, &quot;Expelled&quot; examines it as a political issue. The scientific theory of evolution is portrayed by the film as contributing to fascism, the Holocaust, communism, atheism, and eugenics.

&quot;Expelled&quot; has been used in private screenings to legislators as part of the Discovery Institute intelligent design campaign for Academic Freedom bills. Review screenings were restricted to churches and Christian groups, and at a special pre-release showing, one of the interviewees, PZ Myers, was refused admission. The American Association for the Advancement of Science describes the film as dishonest and divisive propaganda aimed at introducing religious ideas into public school science classrooms, and the Anti-Defamation League has denounced the film&#x27;s allegation that evolutionary theory influenced the Holocaust. The film includes interviews with scientists and academics who were misled into taking part by misrepresentation of the topic and title of the film. Skeptic Michael Shermer describes his experience of being repeatedly asked the same question without context as &quot;surreal&quot;.

==Criticism==

===Scientific criticism===
Advocates of intelligent design seek to keep God and the Bible out of the discussion, and present intelligent design in the language of science as though it were a scientific hypothesis. For a theory to qualify as scientific, it is expected to be:
* Consistent
* Parsimonious (sparing in its proposed entities or explanations; see Occam&#x27;s razor)
* Useful (describes and explains observed phenomena, and can be used in a predictive manner)
* Empirically testable and falsifiable (potentially confirmable or disprovable by experiment or observation)
* Based on multiple observations (often in the form of controlled, repeated experiments)
* Correctable and dynamic (modified in the light of observations that do not support it)
* Progressive (refines previous theories)
* Provisional or tentative (is open to experimental checking, and does not assert certainty)

For any theory, hypothesis, or conjecture to be considered scientific, it must meet most, and ideally all, of these criteria. The fewer criteria are met, the less scientific it is; if it meets only a few or none at all, then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word. Typical objections to defining intelligent design as science are that it lacks consistency, violates the principle of parsimony, is not scientifically useful, is not falsifiable, is not empirically testable, and is not correctable, dynamic, progressive, or provisional.

Intelligent design proponents seek to change this fundamental basis of science by eliminating &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; from science and replacing it with what the leader of the intelligent design movement, Phillip E. Johnson, calls &quot;theistic realism&quot;. Intelligent design proponents argue that naturalistic explanations fail to explain certain phenomena and that supernatural explanations provide a simple and intuitive explanation for the origins of life and the universe. Many intelligent design followers believe that &quot;scientism&quot; is itself a religion that promotes secularism and materialism in an attempt to erase theism from public life, and they view their work in the promotion of intelligent design as a way to return religion to a central role in education and other public spheres.

It has been argued that methodological naturalism is not an &quot;assumption&quot; of science, but a &quot;result&quot; of science well done: the God explanation is the least parsimonious, so according to Occam&#x27;s razor, it cannot be a scientific explanation.

The failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure to submit work to the scientific community that withstands scrutiny have weighed against intelligent design being accepted as valid science. The intelligent design movement has not published a properly peer-reviewed article supporting ID in a scientific journal, and has failed to publish supporting peer-reviewed research or data. The only article published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal that made a case for intelligent design was quickly withdrawn by the publisher for having circumvented the journal&#x27;s peer-review standards. The Discovery Institute says that a number of intelligent design articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals, but critics, largely members of the scientific community, reject this claim and state intelligent design proponents have set up their own journals with peer review that lack impartiality and rigor, consisting entirely of intelligent design supporters.

Further criticism stems from the fact that the phrase &quot;intelligent&quot; design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable intelligence, a concept that has no scientific consensus definition. The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be observable without specifying what the criteria for the measurement of intelligence should be. Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer&#x27;s abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.

Among a significant proportion of the general public in the United States, the major concern is whether conventional evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in God and in the Bible, and how this issue is taught in schools. The Discovery Institute&#x27;s &quot;teach the controversy&quot; campaign promotes intelligent design while attempting to discredit evolution in United States public high school science courses. The scientific community and science education organizations have replied that there is no scientific controversy regarding the validity of evolution and that the controversy exists solely in terms of religion and politics.

===Arguments from ignorance===
Eugenie C. Scott, along with Glenn Branch and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are arguments from ignorance.
In the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that &quot;we don&#x27;t know yet&quot; is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science. Particularly, Michael Behe&#x27;s demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a false dichotomy, where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.

In his conclusion to the Kitzmiller trial, Judge John E. Jones III wrote that &quot;ID is at bottom premised upon a false dichotomy, namely, that to the extent evolutionary theory is discredited, ID is confirmed.&quot; This same argument had been put forward to support creation science at the &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot; (1982) trial, which found it was &quot;contrived dualism&quot;, the false premise of a &quot;two model approach&quot;. Behe&#x27;s argument of irreducible complexity puts forward negative arguments against evolution but does not make any positive scientific case for intelligent design. It fails to allow for scientific explanations continuing to be found, as has been the case with several examples previously put forward as supposed cases of irreducible complexity.

===Possible theological implications===
Intelligent design proponents often insist that their claims do not require a religious component. However, various philosophical and theological issues are naturally raised by the claims of intelligent design.

Intelligent design proponents attempt to demonstrate scientifically that features such as irreducible complexity and specified complexity could not arise through natural processes, and therefore required repeated direct miraculous interventions by a Designer (often a Christian concept of God). They reject the possibility of a Designer who works merely through setting natural laws in motion at the outset, in contrast to theistic evolution (to which even Charles Darwin was open). Intelligent design is distinct because it asserts repeated miraculous interventions in addition to designed laws. This contrasts with other major religious traditions of a created world in which God&#x27;s interactions and influences do not work in the same way as physical causes. The Roman Catholic tradition makes a careful distinction between ultimate metaphysical explanations and secondary, natural causes.

The concept of direct miraculous intervention raises other potential theological implications. If such a Designer does not intervene to alleviate suffering even though capable of intervening for other reasons, some imply the designer is not omnibenevolent (see problem of evil and related theodicy).

Further, repeated interventions imply that the original design was not perfect and final, and thus pose a problem for any who believe that the Creator&#x27;s work had been both perfect and final. Intelligent design proponents seek to explain the problem of poor design in nature by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design (for example, proposing that vestigial organs have unknown purposes), or by proposing that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can, and may have unknowable motives for their actions.

In 2005, the director of the Vatican Observatory, the Jesuit astronomer George Coyne, set out theological reasons for accepting evolution in an August 2005 article in &quot;The Tablet&quot;, and said that &quot;Intelligent design isn&#x27;t science even though it pretends to be. If you want to teach it in schools, intelligent design should be taught when religion or cultural history is taught, not science.&quot; In 2006, he &quot;condemned ID as a kind of &#x27;crude creationism&#x27; which reduced God to a mere engineer.&quot;

Critics state that the wedge strategy&#x27;s &quot;ultimate goal is to create a theocratic state&quot;.

===God of the gaps===
Intelligent design has also been characterized as a God-of-the-gaps argument, which has the following form:
* There is a gap in scientific knowledge.
* The gap is filled with acts of God (or intelligent designer) and therefore proves the existence of God (or intelligent designer).

A God-of-the-gaps argument is the theological version of an argument from ignorance. A key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding questions with explanations (often supernatural) that are unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions. Historians of science observe that the astronomy of the earliest civilizations, although astonishing and incorporating mathematical constructions far in excess of any practical value, proved to be misdirected and of little importance to the development of science because they failed to inquire more carefully into the mechanisms that drove the heavenly bodies across the sky. It was the Greek civilization that first practiced science, although not yet as a formally defined experimental science, but nevertheless an attempt to rationalize the world of natural experience without recourse to divine intervention. In this historically motivated definition of science any appeal to an intelligent creator is explicitly excluded for the paralysing effect it may have on scientific progress.

==Legal challenges in the United States==
===Kitzmiller trial===

&quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; was the first direct challenge brought in the United States federal courts against a public school district that required the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Eleven parents of students in Dover, Pennsylvania, sued the Dover Area School District over a statement that the school board required be read aloud in ninth-grade science classes when evolution was taught. The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Americans United for Separation of Church and State (AU) and Pepper Hamilton LLP. The National Center for Science Education acted as consultants for the plaintiffs. The defendants were represented by the Thomas More Law Center. The suit was tried in a bench trial from September 26 to November 4, 2005, before Judge John E. Jones III. Kenneth R. Miller, Kevin Padian, Brian Alters, Robert T. Pennock, Barbara Forrest and John F. Haught served as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs. Michael Behe, Steve Fuller and Scott Minnich served as expert witnesses for the defense.

On December 20, 2005, Judge Jones issued his 139-page findings of fact and decision, ruling that the Dover mandate was unconstitutional, and barring intelligent design from being taught in Pennsylvania&#x27;s Middle District public school science classrooms. On November 8, 2005, there had been an election in which the eight Dover school board members who voted for the intelligent design requirement were all defeated by challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class, and the current school board president stated that the board did not intend to appeal the ruling.

In his finding of facts, Judge Jones made the following condemnation of the &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; strategy:

===Reaction to Kitzmiller ruling===
Judge Jones himself anticipated that his ruling would be criticized, saying in his decision that:

As Jones had predicted, John G. West, Associate Director of the Center for Science and Culture, said:

Newspapers have noted that the judge is &quot;a Republican and a churchgoer&quot;.

The decision has been examined in a search for flaws and conclusions, partly by intelligent design supporters aiming to avoid future defeats in court. In its Winter issue of 2007, the &quot;Montana Law Review&quot; published three articles.
In the first, David K. DeWolf, John G. West and Casey Luskin, all of the Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory, the Jones court should not have addressed the question of whether it was a scientific theory, and that the Kitzmiller decision will have no effect at all on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory. In the second Peter H. Irons responded, arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned and spells the death knell for the intelligent design efforts to introduce creationism in public schools, while in the third, DeWolf, &quot;et al.&quot;, answer the points made by Irons. However, fear of a similar lawsuit has resulted in other school boards abandoning intelligent design &quot;teach the controversy&quot; proposals.

===Anti-evolution legislation===

A number of anti-evolution bills have been introduced in the United States Congress and State legislatures since 2001, based largely upon language drafted by the Discovery Institute for the Santorum Amendment. Their aim has been to expose more students to articles and videos produced by advocates of intelligent design that criticise evolution. They have been presented as supporting &quot;academic freedom&quot;, on the supposition that teachers, students, and college professors face intimidation and retaliation when discussing scientific criticisms of evolution, and therefore require protection. Critics of the legislation have pointed out that there are no credible scientific critiques of evolution, and an investigation in Florida of allegations of intimidation and retaliation found no evidence that it had occurred. The vast majority of the bills have been unsuccessful, with the one exception being Louisiana&#x27;s Louisiana Science Education Act, which was enacted in 2008.

In April 2010, the American Academy of Religion issued &quot;Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K–12 Public Schools in the United States&quot;, which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as &quot;Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.&quot; However, these worldviews as well as others &quot;that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others.&quot;

==Status outside the United States==

===Europe===
In June 2007, the Council of Europe&#x27;s Committee on Culture, Science and Education issued a report, &quot;The dangers of creationism in education&quot;, which states &quot;Creationism in any of its forms, such as &#x27;intelligent design&#x27;, is not based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes.&quot; In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism, it described intelligent design as &quot;anti-science&quot; and involving &quot;blatant scientific fraud&quot; and &quot;intellectual deception&quot; that &quot;blurs the nature, objectives and limits of science&quot; and links it and other forms of creationism to denialism. On October 4, 2007, the Council of Europe&#x27;s Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution stating that schools should &quot;resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion&quot;, including &quot;intelligent design&quot;, which it described as &quot;the latest, more refined version of creationism&quot;, &quot;presented in a more subtle way&quot;. The resolution emphasises that the aim of the report is not to question or to fight a belief, but to &quot;warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, public education includes religious education, and there are many faith schools that teach the ethos of particular denominations. When it was revealed that a group called Truth in Science had distributed DVDs produced by Illustra Media featuring Discovery Institute fellows making the case for design in nature, and claimed they were being used by 59 schools, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) stated that &quot;Neither creationism nor intelligent design are taught as a subject in schools, and are not specified in the science curriculum&quot; (part of the National Curriculum, which does not apply to private schools or to education in Scotland). The DfES subsequently stated that &quot;Intelligent design is not a recognised scientific theory; therefore, it is not included in the science curriculum&quot;, but left the way open for it to be explored in religious education in relation to different beliefs, as part of a syllabus set by a local Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education. In 2006, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority produced a &quot;Religious Education&quot; model unit in which pupils can learn about religious and nonreligious
views about creationism, intelligent design and evolution by natural selection.

On June 25, 2007, the UK Government responded to an e-petition by saying that creationism and intelligent design should not be taught as science, though teachers would be expected to answer pupils&#x27; questions within the standard framework of established scientific theories. Detailed government &quot;Creationism teaching guidance&quot; for schools in England was published on September 18, 2007. It states that &quot;Intelligent design lies wholly outside of science&quot;, has no underpinning scientific principles, or explanations, and is not accepted by the science community as a whole. Though it should not be taught as science, &quot;Any questions about creationism and intelligent design which arise in science lessons, for example as a result of media coverage, could provide the opportunity to explain or explore why they are not considered to be scientific theories and, in the right context, why evolution is considered to be a scientific theory.&quot; However, &quot;Teachers of subjects such as RE, history or citizenship may deal with creationism and intelligent design in their lessons.&quot;

The British Centre for Science Education lobbying group has the goal of &quot;countering creationism within the UK&quot; and has been involved in government lobbying in the UK in this regard. Northern Ireland&#x27;s Department for Education says that the curriculum provides an opportunity for alternative theories to be taught. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)which has links to fundamentalist Christianityhas been campaigning to have intelligent design taught in science classes. A DUP former Member of Parliament, David Simpson, has sought assurances from the education minister that pupils will not lose marks if they give creationist or intelligent design answers to science questions. In 2007, Lisburn city council voted in favor of a DUP recommendation to write to post-primary schools asking what their plans are to develop teaching material in relation to &quot;creation, intelligent design and other theories of origin&quot;.

Plans by Dutch Education Minister Maria van der Hoeven to &quot;stimulate an academic debate&quot; on the subject in 2005 caused a severe public backlash. After the 2006 elections, she was succeeded by Ronald Plasterk, described as a &quot;molecular geneticist, staunch atheist and opponent of intelligent design&quot;. As a reaction on this situation in the Netherlands, the Director General of the Flemish Secretariat of Catholic Education () in Belgium, , declared that: &quot;Catholic scientists already accepted the theory of evolution for a long time and that intelligent design and creationism doesn&#x27;t belong in Flemish Catholic schools. It&#x27;s not the tasks of the politics to introduce new ideas, that&#x27;s task and goal of science.&quot;

===Australia===
The status of intelligent design in Australia is somewhat similar to that in the UK (see Education in Australia). In 2005, the Australian Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, raised the notion of intelligent design being taught in science classes. The public outcry caused the minister to quickly concede that the correct forum for intelligent design, if it were to be taught, is in religion or philosophy classes. The Australian chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ distributed a DVD of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s documentary &quot;Unlocking the Mystery of Life&quot; (2002) to Australian secondary schools. Tim Hawkes, the head of The King&#x27;s School, one of Australia&#x27;s leading private schools, supported use of the DVD in the classroom at the discretion of teachers and principals.

===Relation to Islam===
Muzaffar Iqbal, a notable Pakistani-Canadian Muslim, signed &quot;A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism&quot;, a petition from the Discovery Institute. Ideas similar to intelligent design have been considered respected intellectual options among Muslims, and in Turkey many intelligent design books have been translated. In Istanbul in 2007, public meetings promoting intelligent design were sponsored by the local government, and David Berlinski of the Discovery Institute was the keynote speaker at a meeting in May 2007.

===Relation to ISKCON===
In 2011, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) Bhaktivedanta Book Trust published an intelligent design book titled &quot;Rethinking Darwin: A Vedic Study of Darwinism and Intelligent Design&quot;. The book included contributions from intelligent design advocates William A. Dembski, Jonathan Wells and Michael Behe as well as from Hindu creationists Leif A. Jensen and Michael Cremo.

<doc id="15302" wikidata="Q409715" url="?curid=15302" title="Integrin">
<text>Integrins are transmembrane receptors that help cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. Upon ligand binding, integrins activate signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular signals such as regulation of the cell cycle, organization of the intracellular cytoskeleton, and movement of new receptors to the cell membrane. The presence of integrins allows rapid and flexible responses to events at the cell surface (&quot;e.g&quot;. signal platelets to initiate an interaction with coagulation factors).

Several types of integrins exist, and one cell generally has multiple different types on its surface. Integrins are found in all animals while integrin-like receptors are found in plant cells.

Integrins work alongside other proteins such as cadherins, the immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules, selectins and syndecans, to mediate cell–cell and cell–matrix interaction. Ligands for integrins include fibronectin, vitronectin, collagen and laminin.

== Structure ==
Integrins are obligate heterodimers composed of α and β subunits. Several genes code for multiple isoforms of these subunits, which gives rise to an array of unique integrins with varied activity. In mammals, integrins are assembled from eighteen α and eight β subunits, in &quot;Drosophila&quot; five α and two β subunits, and in &quot;Caenorhabditis&quot; nematodes two α subunits and one β subunit. The α and β subunits are both class I transmembrane proteins, so each penetrates the plasma membrane once, and can possess several cytoplasmic domains.

Variants of some subunits are formed by differential RNA splicing; for example, four variants of the beta-1 subunit exist. Through different combinations of the α and β subunits, 24 unique mammalian integrins are generated, excluding splice- and glycosylation variants.

Integrin subunits span the cell membrane and have short cytoplasmic domains of 40–70 amino acids. The exception is the beta-4 subunit, which has a cytoplasmic domain of 1,088 amino acids, one of the largest of any membrane protein. Outside the cell membrane, the α and β chains lie close together along a length of about 23 nm; the final 5 nm N-termini of each chain forms a ligand-binding region for the ECM. They have been compared to lobster claws, although they don&#x27;t actually &quot;pinch&quot; their ligand, they chemically interact with it at the insides of the &quot;tips&quot; of their &quot;pinchers&quot;.

The molecular mass of the integrin subunits can vary from 90 kDa to 160 kDa. Beta subunits have four cysteine-rich repeated sequences. Both α and β subunits bind several divalent cations. The role of divalent cations in the α subunit is unknown, but may stabilize the folds of the protein. The cations in the β subunits are more interesting: they are directly involved in coordinating at least some of the ligands that integrins bind.

Integrins can be categorized in multiple ways. For example, some α chains have an additional structural element (or &quot;domain&quot;) inserted toward the N-terminal, the alpha-A domain (so called because it has a similar structure to the A-domains found in the protein von Willebrand factor; it is also termed the α-I domain). Integrins carrying this domain either bind to collagens (e.g. integrins α1 β1, and α2 β1), or act as cell-cell adhesion molecules (integrins of the β2 family). This α-I domain is the binding site for ligands of such integrins. Those integrins that don&#x27;t carry this inserted domain also have an A-domain in their ligand binding site, but &quot;this&quot; A-domain is found on the β subunit.

In both cases, the A-domains carry up to three divalent cation binding sites. One is permanently occupied in physiological concentrations of divalent cations, and carries either a calcium or magnesium ion, the principal divalent cations in blood at median concentrations of 1.4 mM (calcium) and 0.8 mM (magnesium). The other two sites become occupied by cations when ligands bind—at least for those ligands involving an acidic amino acid in their interaction sites. An acidic amino acid features in the integrin-interaction site of many ECM proteins, for example as part of the amino acid sequence Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (&quot;RGD&quot; in the one-letter amino acid code).

=== Structure ===
Despite many years of effort, discovering the high-resolution structure of integrins proved to be challenging, as membrane proteins are classically difficult to purify, and as integrins are large, complex and highly glycosylated with many sugar &#x27;trees&#x27; attached to them. Low-resolution images of detergent extracts of intact integrin GPIIbIIIa, obtained using electron microscopy, and even data from indirect techniques that investigate the solution properties of integrins using ultracentrifugation and light scattering, were combined with fragmentary high-resolution crystallographic or NMR data from single or paired domains of single integrin chains, and molecular models postulated for the rest of the chains.

The X-ray crystal structure obtained for the complete extracellular region of one integrin, αvβ3, shows the molecule to be folded into an inverted V-shape that potentially brings the ligand-binding sites close to the cell membrane. Perhaps more importantly, the crystal structure was also obtained for the same integrin bound to a small ligand containing the RGD-sequence, the drug cilengitide. As detailed above, this finally revealed why divalent cations (in the A-domains) are critical for RGD-ligand binding to integrins. The interaction of such sequences with integrins is believed to be a primary switch by which ECM exerts its effects on cell behaviour.

The structure poses many questions, especially regarding ligand binding and signal transduction. The ligand binding site is directed towards the C-terminal of the integrin, the region where the molecule emerges from the cell membrane. If it emerges orthogonally from the membrane, the ligand binding site would apparently be obstructed, especially as integrin ligands are typically massive and well cross-linked components of the ECM. In fact, little is known about the angle that membrane proteins subtend to the plane of the membrane; this is a problem difficult to address with available technologies. The default assumption is that they emerge rather like little lollipops, but there is little evidence for this. The integrin structure has drawn attention to this problem, which may have general implications for how membrane proteins work. It appears that the integrin transmembrane helices are tilted (see &quot;Activation&quot; below), which hints that the extracellular chains may also not be orthogonal with respect to the membrane surface.

Although the crystal structure changed surprisingly little after binding to cilengitide, the current hypothesis is that integrin function involves changes in shape to move the ligand-binding site into a more accessible position, away from the cell surface, and this shape change also triggers intracellular signaling. There is a wide body of cell-biological and biochemical literature that supports this view. Perhaps the most convincing evidence involves the use of antibodies that only recognize integrins when they have bound to their ligands, or are activated. As the &quot;footprint&quot; that an antibody makes on its binding target is roughly a circle about 3 nm in diameter, the resolution of this technique is low. Nevertheless, these so-called LIBS (Ligand-Induced-Binding-Sites) antibodies unequivocally show that dramatic changes in integrin shape routinely occur. However, how the changes detected with antibodies look on the structure is still unknown.

=== Activation ===

When released into the cell membrane, newly synthesized integrin dimers are speculated to be found in the same &quot;bent&quot; conformation revealed by the structural studies described above. One school of thought claims that this bent form prevents them from interacting with their ligands, although bent forms can predominate in high-resolution EM structures of integrin bound to an ECM ligand. Therefore, at least in biochemical experiments, integrin dimers must apparently not be &#x27;unbent&#x27; in order to prime them and allow their binding to the ECM. In cells, the priming is accomplished by a protein talin, which binds to the β tail of the integrin dimer and changes its conformation. The α and β integrin chains are both class-I transmembrane proteins: they pass the plasma membrane as single transmembrane alpha-helices. Unfortunately, the helices are too long, and recent studies suggest that, for integrin gpIIbIIIa, they are tilted with respect both to one another and to the plane of the membrane. Talin binding alters the angle of tilt of the β3 chain transmembrane helix in model systems and this may reflect a stage in the process of inside-out signalling which primes integrins. Moreover, talin proteins are able to dimerize and thus are thought to intervene in the clustering of integrin dimers which leads to the formation of a focal adhesion. Recently, the Kindlin-1 and Kindlin-2 proteins have also been found to interact with integrin and activate it.

== Function ==
Integrins have two main functions, attachment of the cells to the ECM and signal transduction from the ECM to the cells. They are also involved in a wide range of other biological activities, including extravasation, cell-to-cell adhesion, cell migration, and as receptors for certain viruses, such as adenovirus, echovirus, hantavirus, foot-and-mouth disease, polio virus and other viruses. Recently, the importance of integrins in the progress of autoimmune disorders is also gaining attention of the scientists. These mechanoreceptors seem to regulate autoimmunity by dictating various intracellular pathways to control immune cell adhesion to endothelial cell layers followed by their trans-migration. This process might or might not be dependent on the sheer force faced by the extracellular parts of different integrins.

A prominent function of the integrins is seen in the molecule GpIIb/IIIa, an integrin on the surface of blood platelets (thrombocytes) responsible for attachment to fibrin within a developing blood clot. This molecule dramatically increases its binding affinity for fibrin/fibrinogen through association of platelets with exposed collagens in the wound site. Upon association of platelets with collagen, GPIIb/IIIa changes shape, allowing it to bind to fibrin and other blood components to form the clot matrix and stop blood loss.

=== Attachment of cell to the ECM ===
Integrins couple the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) outside a cell to the cytoskeleton (in particular, the microfilaments) inside the cell. Which ligand in the ECM the integrin can bind to is defined by which α and β subunits the integrin is made of. Among the ligands of integrins are fibronectin, vitronectin, collagen, and laminin. The connection between the cell and the ECM may help the cell to endure pulling forces without being ripped out of the ECM. The ability of a cell to create this kind of bond is also of vital importance in ontogeny.

Cell attachment to the ECM is a basic requirement to build a multicellular organism. Integrins are not simply hooks, but give the cell critical signals about the nature of its surroundings. Together with signals arising from receptors for soluble growth factors like VEGF, EGF, and many others, they enforce a cellular decision on what biological action to take, be it attachment, movement, death, or differentiation. Thus integrins lie at the heart of many cellular biological processes. The attachment of the cell takes place through formation of cell adhesion complexes, which consist of integrins and many cytoplasmic proteins, such as talin, vinculin, paxillin, and alpha-actinin. These act by regulating kinases such as FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and Src kinase family members to phosphorylate substrates such as p130CAS thereby recruiting signaling adaptors such as CRK. These adhesion complexes attach to the actin cytoskeleton. The integrins thus serve to link two networks across the plasma membrane: the extracellular ECM and the intracellular actin filamentous system. Integrin α6β4 is an exception: it links to the keratin intermediate filament system in epithelial cells.

Focal adhesions are large molecular complexes, which are generated following interaction of integrins with ECM, then their clustering. The clusters likely provide sufficient intracellular binding sites to permit the formation of stable signaling complexes on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. So the focal adhesions contain integrin ligand, integrin molecule, and associate plaque proteins. Binding is propelled by changes in free energy. As previously stated, these complexes connect the extracellular matrix to actin bundles. Cryo-electron tomography reveals that the adhesion contains particles on the cell membrane with diameter of 25 +/- 5 nm and spaced at approximately 45 nm. Treatment with Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 reduces the size of the particle, and it is extremely mechanosensitive.

One important function of integrins on cells in tissue culture is their role in cell migration. Cells adhere to a substrate through their integrins. During movement, the cell makes new attachments to the substrate at its front and concurrently releases those at its rear. When released from the substrate, integrin molecules are taken back into the cell by endocytosis; they are transported through the cell to its front by the endocytic cycle, where they are added back to the surface. In this way they are cycled for reuse, enabling the cell to make fresh attachments at its leading front. The cycle of integrin endocytosis and recycling back to the cell surface is important for migrating cells and also during animal development.

=== Signal transduction ===
Integrins play an important role in cell signaling by modulating the cell signaling pathways of transmembrane protein kinases such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). While the interaction between integrin and receptor tyrosine kinases originally was thought of as uni-directional and supportive, recent studies indicate that integrins have additional, multi-faceted roles in cell signaling. 
Integrins can regulate the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by recruiting specific adaptors to the plasma membrane. For example, β1c integrin recruits Gab1/Shp2 and presents Shp2 to IGF1R, resulting in dephosphorylation of the receptor. In a reverse direction, when a receptor tyrosine kinase is activated, integrins co-localise at focal adhesion with the receptor tyrosine kinases and their associated signaling molecules.

The repertoire of integrins expressed on a particular cell can specify the signaling pathway due to the differential binding affinity of ECM ligands for the integrins. The tissue stiffness and matrix composition can initiate specific signaling pathways regulating cell behavior. Clustering and activation of the integrins/actin complexes strengthen the focal adhesion interaction and initiate the framework for cell signaling through assembly of adhesomes.

Depending on the integrin&#x27;s regulatory impact on specific receptor tyrosine kinases, the cell can experience:
* cell growth
* cell division
* cell survival
* cellular differentiation
* apoptosis (programmed cell death)

Knowledge of the relationship between integrins and receptor tyrosine kinase has laid a foundation for new approaches to cancer therapy. Specifically, targeting integrins associated with RTKs is an emerging approach for inhibiting angiogenesis.

== Integrins and nerve repair ==
Integrins have an important function in neuroregeneration after injury of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Integrins are present at the growth cone of damaged PNS neurons and attach to ligands in the ECM to promote axon regeneration. It is unclear whether integrins can promote axon regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS). There are two obstacles that prevent integrin-mediated regeneration in the CNS: 1) integrins are not localised in the axon of most adult CNS neurons and 2) integrins become inactivated by molecules in the scar tissue after injury.

== Vertebrate integrins ==
The following are 16 of the ~24 integrins found in vertebrates:
Beta-1 integrins interact with many alpha integrin chains. Gene knockouts of integrins in mice are not always lethal, which suggests that during embryonal development, one integrin may substitute its function for another in order to allow survival. Some integrins are on the cell surface in an inactive state, and can be rapidly primed, or put into a state capable of binding their ligands, by cytokines. Integrins can assume several different well-defined shapes or &quot;conformational states&quot;. Once primed, the conformational state changes to stimulate ligand binding, which then activates the receptors — also by inducing a shape change — to trigger outside-in signal transduction.

<doc id="15303" wikidata="Q62536" url="?curid=15303" title="Ion channel">
<text>Ion channels are pore-forming membrane proteins that allow ions to pass through the channel pore. Their functions include establishing a resting membrane potential, shaping action potentials and other electrical signals by gating the flow of ions across the cell membrane, controlling the flow of ions across secretory and epithelial cells, and regulating cell volume. Ion channels are present in the membranes of all cells. Ion channels are one of the two classes of ionophoric proteins, the other being ion transporters.

The study of ion channels often involves biophysics, electrophysiology, and pharmacology, while using techniques including voltage clamp, patch clamp, immunohistochemistry, X-ray crystallography, fluoroscopy, and RT-PCR. Their classification as molecules is referred to as channelomics.
== Basic features ==

There are two distinctive features of ion channels that differentiate them from other types of ion transporter proteins:
# The rate of ion transport through the channel is very high (often 106 ions per second or greater).
# Ions pass through channels down their electrochemical gradient, which is a function of ion concentration and membrane potential, &quot;downhill&quot;, without the input (or help) of metabolic energy (e.g. ATP, co-transport mechanisms, or active transport mechanisms).
Ion channels are located within the membrane of all excitable cells, and of many intracellular organelles. They are often described as narrow, water-filled tunnels that allow only ions of a certain size and/or charge to pass through. This characteristic is called selective permeability. The archetypal channel pore is just one or two atoms wide at its narrowest point and is selective for specific species of ion, such as sodium or potassium. However, some channels may be permeable to the passage of more than one type of ion, typically sharing a common charge: positive (cations) or negative (anions). Ions often move through the segments of the channel pore in a single file nearly as quickly as the ions move through the free solution. In many ion channels, passage through the pore is governed by a &quot;gate&quot;, which may be opened or closed in response to chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force.

Ion channels are integral membrane proteins, typically formed as assemblies of several individual proteins. Such &quot;multi-subunit&quot; assemblies usually involve a circular arrangement of identical or homologous proteins closely packed around a water-filled pore through the plane of the membrane or lipid bilayer. For most voltage-gated ion channels, the pore-forming subunit(s) are called the α subunit, while the auxiliary subunits are denoted β, γ, and so on.

== Biological role ==

Because channels underlie the nerve impulse and because &quot;transmitter-activated&quot; channels mediate conduction across the synapses, channels are especially prominent components of the nervous system. Indeed, numerous toxins that organisms have evolved for shutting down the nervous systems of predators and prey (e.g., the venoms produced by spiders, scorpions, snakes, fish, bees, sea snails, and others) work by modulating ion channel conductance and/or kinetics. In addition, ion channels are key components in a wide variety of biological processes that involve rapid changes in cells, such as cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle contraction, epithelial transport of nutrients and ions, T-cell activation, and pancreatic beta-cell insulin release. In the search for new drugs, ion channels are a frequent target.

==Diversity==

There are over 300 types of ion channels just in the cells of the inner ear. Ion channels may be classified by the nature of their gating, the species of ions passing through those gates, the number of gates (pores), and localization of proteins.

Further heterogeneity of ion channels arises when channels with different constitutive subunits give rise to a specific kind of current. Absence or mutation of one or more of the contributing types of channel subunits can result in loss of function and, potentially, underlie neurologic diseases.

===Classification by gating===

Ion channels may be classified by gating, i.e. what opens and closes the channels. For example, voltage-gated ion channels open or close depending on the voltage gradient across the plasma membrane, while ligand-gated ion channels open or close depending on binding of ligands to the channel.

====Voltage-gated====
Voltage-gated ion channels open and close in response to membrane potential.
* Voltage-gated sodium channels: This family contains at least 9 members and is largely responsible for action potential creation and propagation. The pore-forming α subunits are very large (up to 4,000 amino acids) and consist of four homologous repeat domains (I-IV) each comprising six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) for a total of 24 transmembrane segments. The members of this family also coassemble with auxiliary β subunits, each spanning the membrane once. Both α and β subunits are extensively glycosylated.
* Voltage-gated calcium channels: This family contains 10 members, though these are known to coassemble with α2δ, β, and γ subunits. These channels play an important role in both linking muscle excitation with contraction as well as neuronal excitation with transmitter release. The α subunits have an overall structural resemblance to those of the sodium channels and are equally large.
** Cation channels of sperm: This small family of channels, normally referred to as Catsper channels, is related to the two-pore channels and distantly related to TRP channels.
* Voltage-gated potassium channels (KV): This family contains almost 40 members, which are further divided into 12 subfamilies. These channels are known mainly for their role in repolarizing the cell membrane following action potentials. The α subunits have six transmembrane segments, homologous to a single domain of the sodium channels. Correspondingly, they assemble as tetramers to produce a functioning channel.
* Some transient receptor potential channels: This group of channels, normally referred to simply as TRP channels, is named after their role in Drosophila phototransduction. This family, containing at least 28 members, is incredibly diverse in its method of activation. Some TRP channels seem to be constitutively open, while others are gated by voltage, intracellular Ca2+, pH, redox state, osmolarity, and mechanical stretch. These channels also vary according to the ion(s) they pass, some being selective for Ca2+ while others are less selective, acting as cation channels. This family is subdivided into 6 subfamilies based on homology: classical (TRPC), vanilloid receptors (TRPV), melastatin (TRPM), polycystins (TRPP), mucolipins (TRPML), and ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 (TRPA).
* Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels: The opening of these channels is due to hyperpolarization rather than the depolarization required for other cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. These channels are also sensitive to the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP, which alter the voltage sensitivity of the channel&#x27;s opening. These channels are permeable to the monovalent cations K+ and Na+. There are 4 members of this family, all of which form tetramers of six-transmembrane α subunits. As these channels open under hyperpolarizing conditions, they function as pacemaking channels in the heart, particularly the SA node.
* Voltage-gated proton channels: Voltage-gated proton channels open with depolarization, but in a strongly pH-sensitive manner. The result is that these channels open only when the electrochemical gradient is outward, such that their opening will only allow protons to leave cells. Their function thus appears to be acid extrusion from cells. Another important function occurs in phagocytes (e.g. eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages) during the &quot;respiratory burst.&quot; When bacteria or other microbes are engulfed by phagocytes, the enzyme NADPH oxidase assembles in the membrane and begins to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that help kill bacteria. NADPH oxidase is electrogenic, moving electrons across the membrane, and proton channels open to allow proton flux to balance the electron movement electrically.

==== Ligand-gated (neurotransmitter) ====
Also known as ionotropic receptors, this group of channels open in response to specific ligand molecules binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor protein. Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the structure of the channel protein that ultimately leads to the opening of the channel gate and subsequent ion flux across the plasma membrane. Examples of such channels include the cation-permeable nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, ionotropic glutamate-gated receptors, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), ATP-gated P2X receptors, and the anion-permeable γ-aminobutyric acid-gated GABAA receptor.

Ion channels activated by second messengers may also be categorized in this group, although ligands and second messengers are otherwise distinguished from each other.

==== Lipid-gated ====
This group of channels opens in response to specific lipid molecules binding to the channel&#x27;s transmembrane domain typically near the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are the best-characterized lipids to gate these channels. Many of the leak potassium channels are gated by lipids including the inward-rectifier potassium channels and two pore domain potassium channels TREK-1 and TRAAK. KCNQ potassium channel family are gated by PIP2. The voltage activated potassium channel (Kv) is regulated by PA. Its midpoint of activation shifts +50 mV upon PA hydrolysis, near resting membrane potentials. This suggests Kv could be opened by lipid hydrolysis independent of voltage and may qualify this channel as dual lipid and voltage gated channel.

==== Other gating ====

Gating also includes activation and inactivation by second messengers from the inside of the cell membrane – rather than from outside the cell, as in the case for ligands.
* Some potassium channels:
** Inward-rectifier potassium channels: These channels allow potassium ions to flow into the cell in an &quot;inwardly rectifying&quot; manner: potassium flows more efficiently into than out of the cell. This family is composed of 15 official and 1 unofficial member and is further subdivided into 7 subfamilies based on homology. These channels are affected by intracellular ATP, PIP2, and G-protein βγ subunits. They are involved in important physiological processes such as pacemaker activity in the heart, insulin release, and potassium uptake in glial cells. They contain only two transmembrane segments, corresponding to the core pore-forming segments of the KV and KCa channels. Their α subunits form tetramers.
** Calcium-activated potassium channels: This family of channels is activated by intracellular Ca2+ and contains 8 members.
** Tandem pore domain potassium channel: This family of 15 members form what are known as leak channels, and they display Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (open) rectification. Contrary to their common name of &#x27;Two-pore-domain potassium channels&#x27;, these channels have only one pore but two pore domains per subunit.
* Two-pore channels include ligand-gated and voltage-gated cation channels, so-named because they contain two pore-forming subunits. As their name suggests, they have two pores.
* Light-gated channels like channelrhodopsin are directly opened by photons.
* Mechanosensitive ion channels open under the influence of stretch, pressure, shear, and displacement.
* Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels: This superfamily of channels contains two families: the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. This grouping is functional rather than evolutionary.
** Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels: This family of channels is characterized by activation by either intracellular cAMP or cGMP. These channels are primarily permeable to monovalent cations such as K+ and Na+. They are also permeable to Ca2+, though it acts to close them. There are 6 members of this family, which is divided into 2 subfamilies.
** Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels
* Temperature-gated channels: Members of the transient receptor potential ion channel superfamily, such as TRPV1 or TRPM8, are opened either by hot or cold temperatures.

===Classification by type of ions===
* Chloride channels: This superfamily of channels consists of approximately 13 members. They include ClCs, CLICs, Bestrophins and CFTRs. These channels are non-selective for small anions; however chloride is the most abundant anion, and hence they are known as chloride channels.
* Potassium channels
** Voltage-gated potassium channels e.g., Kvs, Kirs etc.
** Calcium-activated potassium channels e.g., BKCa or MaxiK, SK, etc.
** Inward-rectifier potassium channels
** Two-pore-domain potassium channels: This family of 15 members form what is known as leak channels, and they display Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (open) rectification.
* Sodium channels
** Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs)
** Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs)
* Calcium channels (CaVs)
* Phosphate channels: To date, only one phosphate channel, Xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1), has been identified in animals. It is a pyrophosphate-gated channel.
* Proton channels
** Voltage-gated proton channels
* &quot;Non-selective cation channels&quot;: These non-selectively allow many types of cations, mainly Na+, K+ and Ca2+, through the channel.
** Most transient receptor potential channels

=== Classification by cellular localization ===

Ion channels are also classified according to their subcellular localization. The plasma membrane accounts for around 2% of the total membrane in the cell, whereas intracellular organelles contain 98% of the cell&#x27;s membrane. The major intracellular compartments are endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria. On the basis of localization, ion channels are classified as:
* Plasma membrane channels
** Examples: Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv), Sodium channels (Nav), Calcium channels (Cav) and Chloride channels (ClC)
* Intracellular channels, which are further classified into different organelles
** Endoplasmic reticulum channels: RyR, SERCA, ORAi
** Mitochondrial channels: mPTP, KATP, BK, IK, CLIC5, Kv7.4 at the inner membrane and VDAC and CLIC4 as outer membrane channels.

=== Other classifications ===

Some ion channels are classified by the duration of their response to stimuli:
* Transient receptor potential channels: This group of channels, normally referred to simply as TRP channels, is named after their role in &quot;Drosophila&quot; visual phototransduction. This family, containing at least 28 members, is diverse in its mechanisms of activation. Some TRP channels remain constitutively open, while others are gated by voltage, intracellular Ca2+, pH, redox state, osmolarity, and mechanical stretch. These channels also vary according to the ion(s) they pass, some being selective for Ca2+ while others are less selective cation channels. This family is subdivided into 6 subfamilies based on homology: canonical TRP (TRPC), vanilloid receptors (TRPV), melastatin (TRPM), polycystins (TRPP), mucolipins (TRPML), and ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 (TRPA).

== Detailed structure ==

Channels differ with respect to the ion they let pass (for example, Na+, K+, Cl−), the ways in which they may be regulated, the number of subunits of which they are composed and other aspects of structure. Channels belonging to the largest class, which includes the voltage-gated channels that underlie the nerve impulse, consist of four or sometimes five subunits with six transmembrane helices each. On activation, these helices move about and open the pore. Two of these six helices are separated by a loop that lines the pore and is the primary determinant of ion selectivity and conductance in this channel class and some others.

The existence and mechanism for ion selectivity was first postulated in the late 1960s by Bertil Hille and Clay Armstrong. The idea of the ionic selectivity for potassium channels was that the carbonyl oxygens of the protein backbones of the &quot;selectivity filter&quot; (named by Bertil Hille) could efficiently replace the water molecules that normally shield potassium ions, but that sodium ions were smaller and cannot be completely dehydrated to allow such shielding, and therefore could not pass through. This mechanism was finally confirmed when the first structure of an ion channel was elucidated. A bacterial potassium channel KcsA, consisting of just the selectivity filter, &quot;P&quot; loop, and two transmembrane helices was used as a model to study the permeability and the selectivity of ion channels in the Mackinnon lab. The determination of the molecular structure of KcsA by Roderick MacKinnon using X-ray crystallography won a share of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Because of their small size and the difficulty of crystallizing integral membrane proteins for X-ray analysis, it is only very recently that scientists have been able to directly examine what channels &quot;look like.&quot; Particularly in cases where the crystallography required removing channels from their membranes with detergent, many researchers regard images that have been obtained as tentative. An example is the long-awaited crystal structure of a voltage-gated potassium channel, which was reported in May 2003. One inevitable ambiguity about these structures relates to the strong evidence that channels change conformation as they operate (they open and close, for example), such that the structure in the crystal could represent any one of these operational states. Most of what researchers have deduced about channel operation so far they have established through electrophysiology, biochemistry, gene sequence comparison and mutagenesis.

Channels can have single (CLICs) to multiple transmembrane (K channels, P2X receptors, Na channels) domains which span plasma membrane to form pores. Pore can determine the selectivity of the channel. Gate can be formed either inside or outside the pore region.

==Pharmacology==

Chemical substances can modulate the activity of ion channels, for example by blocking or activating them.

===Ion channel blockers===

A variety of ion channel blockers (inorganic and organic molecules) can modulate ion channel activity and conductance.
Some commonly used blockers include:
* Tetrodotoxin (TTX), used by puffer fish and some types of newts for defense. It blocks sodium channels.
* Saxitoxin is produced by a dinoflagellate also known as &quot;red tide&quot;. It blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels.
* Conotoxin is used by cone snails to hunt prey.
* Lidocaine and novocaine belong to a class of local anesthetics which block sodium ion channels.
* Dendrotoxin is produced by mamba snakes, and blocks potassium channels.
* Iberiotoxin is produced by the &quot;Hottentotta tamulus&quot; (Eastern Indian scorpion) and blocks potassium channels.
* Heteropodatoxin is produced by &quot;Heteropoda venatoria&quot; (brown huntsman spider or laya) and blocks potassium channels.

===Ion channel activators===

Several compounds are known to promote the opening or activation of specific ion channels. These are classified by the channel on which they act:
* Calcium channel openers, such as Bay K8644
* Chloride channel openers, such as phenanthroline
* Potassium channel openers, such as minoxidil
* Sodium channel openers, such as DDT

==Diseases==

There are a number of disorders which disrupt normal functioning of ion channels and have disastrous consequences for the organism. Genetic and autoimmune disorders of ion channels and their modifiers are known as channelopathies. See :Category:Channelopathies for a full list.
* Shaker gene mutations cause a defect in the voltage gated ion channels, slowing down the repolarization of the cell.
* Equine hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis as well as human hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP) are caused by a defect in voltage-dependent sodium channels.
* Paramyotonia congenita (PC) and potassium-aggravated myotonias (PAM)
* Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+)
* Episodic ataxia (EA), characterized by sporadic bouts of severe discoordination with or without myokymia, and can be provoked by stress, startle, or heavy exertion such as exercise.
* Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM)
* Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13
* Long QT syndrome is a ventricular arrhythmia syndrome caused by mutations in one or more of presently ten different genes, most of which are potassium channels and all of which affect cardiac repolarization.
* Brugada syndrome is another ventricular arrhythmia caused by voltage-gated sodium channel gene mutations.
* Polymicrogyria is a developmental brain malformation caused by voltage-gated sodium channel and NMDA receptor gene mutations.
* Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which is a chloride channel.
* Mucolipidosis type IV is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the TRPML1 channel
* Mutations in and overexpression of ion channels are important events in cancer cells. In Glioblastoma multiforme, upregulation of gBK potassium channels and ClC-3 chloride channels enables glioblastoma cells to migrate within the brain, which may lead to the diffuse growth patterns of these tumors.

== History ==
The fundamental properties of currents mediated by ion channels were analyzed by the British biophysicists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley as part of their Nobel Prize-winning research on the action potential, published in 1952. They built on the work of other physiologists, such as Cole and Baker&#x27;s research into voltage-gated membrane pores from 1941. The existence of ion channels was confirmed in the 1970s by Bernard Katz and Ricardo Miledi using noise analysis . It was then shown more directly with an electrical recording technique known as the &quot;patch clamp&quot;, which led to a Nobel Prize to Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, the technique&#x27;s inventors. Hundreds if not thousands of researchers continue to pursue a more detailed understanding of how these proteins work. In recent years the development of automated patch clamp devices helped to increase significantly the throughput in ion channel screening.

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2003 was awarded to Roderick MacKinnon for his studies on the physico-chemical properties of ion channel structure and function, including x-ray crystallographic structure studies.

== Culture ==
Roderick MacKinnon commissioned &quot;Birth of an Idea&quot;, a tall sculpture based on the KcsA potassium channel. The artwork contains a wire object representing the channel&#x27;s interior with a blown glass object representing the main cavity of the channel structure.

== Ion Channels and Stochastic Processes ==
The behavior of ion channels can be usefully modeled using mathematics and probability. Stochastic processes are mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. A very simple example is flipping a coin; each flip has an equal chance to be heads or tails, the chances are not influenced by the outcome of past flips, and we can say that pheads = 0.5 and ptails = 0.5.

A particularly relevant form of stochastic processes in the study of ion channels is Markov chains. In a Markov chain, there are multiple states, each of which has given chances to transition to different states over a particular period of time. Ion channels undergo state transitions (e.g. open, closed, inactive) that behave like Markov chains. Markov chain analysis can be used to make conclusions regarding the nature of a given ion channel, including the likely number of open and closed states. We can also use Markov chain analysis to produce models that accurately simulate the insertion of ion channels into cell membranes.

Markov chains can also be used in combination with the stochastic matrix to determine the stable distribution matrix by solving the equation PX=X, where P is the stochastic matrix and X is the stable distribution matrix. This stable distribution matrix tells us the relative frequencies of each state after a long time, which in the context of ion channels can be the frequencies of the open, closed, and inactive states for an ion channel. Note that Markov chain assumptions apply, including that (1) all transition probabilities for each state sum to one, (2) the probability model applies to all possible states, and (3) that the probability of transitions are constant over time. Therefore, Markov chains have limited applicability in some situations. 

There are a variety of other stochastic processes that are utilized in the study of ion channels, but are too complex to relate here and can be examined more closely elsewhere.

<text>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source-code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Some IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and Lazarus contain the necessary compiler, interpreter or both; others, such as SharpDevelop and NetBeans, do not.

The boundary between an IDE and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined; sometimes a version control system or various tools to simplify the construction of a graphical user interface (GUI) are integrated. Many modern IDEs also have a class browser, an object browser, and a class hierarchy diagram for use in object-oriented software development.

== Overview ==

Integrated development environments are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar user interfaces. IDEs present a single program in which all development is done. This program typically provides many features for authoring, modifying, compiling, deploying and debugging software. This contrasts with software development using unrelated tools, such as vi, GDB, GNU Compiler Collection, or make.

One aim of the IDE is to reduce the configuration necessary to piece together multiple development utilities. Instead, it provides the same set of capabilities as one cohesive unit. Reducing setup time can increase developer productivity, especially in cases where learning to use the IDE is faster than manually integrating and learning all of the individual tools. Tighter integration of all development tasks has the potential to improve overall productivity beyond just helping with setup tasks. For example, code can be continuously parsed while it is being edited, providing instant feedback when syntax errors are introduced, thus allowing developers to debug code much faster and more easily with an IDE.

Some IDEs are dedicated to a specific programming language, allowing a feature set that most closely matches the programming paradigms of the language. However, there are many multiple-language IDEs.

While most modern IDEs are graphical, text-based IDEs such as Turbo Pascal were in popular use before the availability of windowing systems like Microsoft Windows and the X Window System (X11). They commonly use function keys or hotkeys to execute frequently used commands or macros.

== History ==
IDEs initially became possible when developing via a console or terminal. Early systems could not support one, since programs were submitted to a compiler or assembler via punched cards, paper tape, etc. Dartmouth BASIC was the first language to be created with an IDE (and was also the first to be designed for use while sitting in front of a console or terminal). Its IDE (part of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System) was command-based, and therefore did not look much like the menu-driven, graphical IDEs popular after the advent of the graphical user interface. However it integrated editing, file management, compilation, debugging and execution in a manner consistent with a modern IDE.

Maestro I is a product from Softlab Munich and was the world&#x27;s first integrated development environment for software. Maestro I was installed for 22,000 programmers worldwide. Until 1989, 6,000 installations existed in the Federal Republic of Germany. Maestro was arguably the world leader in this field during the 1970s and 1980s. Today one of the last Maestro I can be found in the Museum of Information Technology at Arlington in Texas.

One of the first IDEs with a plug-in concept was Softbench. In 1995 &quot;Computerwoche&quot; commented that the use of an IDE was not well received by developers since it would fence in their creativity.

, the most commonly searched for IDEs on Google Search were Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Eclipse.

== Topics ==

=== Syntax highlighting ===
The IDE editor usually provides syntax highlighting, it can show both the structures, the language keywords and the syntax errors with visually distinct colors and font effects.

=== Code completion ===

Code completion is an important IDE feature, intended to speed up programming. Modern IDEs even have intelligent code completion.

====Intelligent code completion====
=== Refactoring ===

Advanced IDEs provide support for automated refactoring.

=== Version control ===

An IDE is expected to provide integrated version control, in order to interact with source repositories.

=== Debugging ===

IDEs are also used for debugging, using an integrated debugger, with support for setting breakpoints in the editor, visual rendering of steps, etc.

=== Code search ===

IDEs may provide support for code search. Code search has two different meanings. First, it means searching for class and function declarations, usages, variable and field read/write, etc. IDEs can use different kinds of user interface for code search, for example form-based widgets and natural-language based interfaces.
Second, it means searching for a concrete implementation of some specified functionality.
=== Visual programming ===
Visual programming is a usage scenario in which an IDE is generally required. Visual Basic allows users to create new applications by moving programming, building blocks, or code nodes to create flowcharts or structure diagrams that are then compiled or interpreted. These flowcharts often are based on the Unified Modeling Language.

This interface has been popularized with the Lego Mindstorms system and is being actively perused by a number of companies wishing to capitalize on the power of custom browsers like those found at Mozilla. KTechlab supports flowcode and is a popular open-source IDE and Simulator for developing software for microcontrollers. Visual programming is also responsible for the power of distributed programming (cf. LabVIEW and EICASLAB software). An early visual programming system, Max, was modeled after an analog synthesizer design and has been used to develop real-time music performance software since the 1980s. Another early example was Prograph, a dataflow-based system originally developed for the Macintosh. The graphical programming environment &quot;Grape&quot; is used to program qfix robot kits.

This approach is also used in specialist software such as Openlab, where the end-users want the flexibility of a full programming language, without the traditional learning curve associated with one.

=== Language support ===
Some IDEs support multiple languages, such as GNU Emacs, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, MyEclipse, NetBeans, MonoDevelop, JDoodle or PlayCode.

Support for alternative languages is often provided by plugins, allowing them to be installed on the same IDE at the same time. For example, Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs 24 with support for 39 languages. Another example is JDoodle, an online cloud-based IDE that supports 88 languages. Eclipse, and Netbeans have plugins for C/C++, Ada, GNAT (for example AdaGIDE), Perl, Python, Ruby, and PHP, which are selected between automatically based on file extension, environment or project settings.

=== Implementation ===
IDEs can be implemented in various languages, for example:
* GNU Emacs using Emacs Lisp and C;
* IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and NetBeans, using Java;
* MonoDevelop using C#.

=== Attitudes across different computing platforms ===
Unix programmers can combine command-line POSIX tools into a complete development environment, capable of developing large programs such as the Linux kernel and its environment. In this sense, the entire Unix system functions as an IDE. The free software GNU toolchain (including GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU Debugger (GDB), and GNU make) is available on many platforms, including Windows. The pervasive Unix philosophy of &quot;everything is a text stream&quot; enables developers who favor command-line oriented tools to use editors with support for many of the standard Unix and GNU build tools, building an IDE with programs like
Emacs
or Vim. Data Display Debugger is intended to be an advanced graphical front-end for many text-based debugger standard tools. Some programmers prefer managing makefiles and their derivatives to the similar code building tools included in a full IDE. For example, most contributors to the PostgreSQL database use make and GDB directly to develop new features. Even when building PostgreSQL for Microsoft Windows using Visual C++, Perl scripts are used as a replacement for make rather than relying on any IDE features. Some Linux IDEs such as Geany attempt to provide a graphical front end to traditional build operations.

On the various Microsoft Windows platforms, command-line tools for development are seldom used. Accordingly, there are many commercial and non-commercial products. However, each has a different design commonly creating incompatibilities. Most major compiler vendors for Windows still provide free copies of their command-line tools, including Microsoft (Visual C++, Platform SDK, .NET Framework SDK, nmake utility).

IDEs have always been popular on the Apple Macintosh&#x27;s classic Mac OS and macOS, dating back to Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop, Turbo Pascal, THINK Pascal and THINK C environments of the mid-1980s. Currently macOS programmers can choose between native IDEs like Xcode and open-source tools such as Eclipse and Netbeans. ActiveState Komodo is a proprietary multilanguage IDE supported on macOS.

== Online ==
An online integrated development environment, also known as a web IDE or cloud IDE, is a browser based IDE that allows for software development or web development. An online IDE can be accessed from a web browser, allowing for a portable work environment. An online IDE does not usually contain all of the same features as a traditional or desktop IDE although all of the basic IDE features, such as syntax highlighting, are typically present.

A Mobile-Based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for software development on mobile platforms. Unlike traditional desktop IDEs, mobile-based IDEs are designed to run on smartphones and tablets, allowing developers to write, debug, and deploy code directly from their mobile devices.

<text>Sir Ian Murray McKellen (born 25 May 1939) is an English actor. He has played roles on the screen and stage in genres ranging from Shakespearean dramas and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction. He is regarded as a British cultural icon and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991. He has received numerous accolades, including a Tony Award, six Olivier Awards, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards and five Emmy Awards.

McKellen made his stage debut in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of its repertory company, and in 1965 made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; and Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot;. In the 1970s McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain. He has earned five Olivier Awards for his roles in &quot;Pillars of the Community&quot; (1977), &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (1978), &quot;Bent&quot; (1979), &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (1984), and &quot;Richard III&quot; (1995). McKellen made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Promise&quot; (1965). He went on to receive the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role as Antonio Salieri in &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1980). He was further nominated for &quot;Ian McKellen: Acting Shakespeare&quot; (1984). He returned to Broadway in &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (1986), &quot;Dance of Death&quot; (1990), &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (2013), and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (2013), the latter two being a joint production with Patrick Stewart.

McKellen achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in &quot;Richard III&quot; (1995), James Whale in &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; (1998), Magneto in the &quot;X-Men&quot; films, Cogsworth in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (2017) and Gandalf in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (2001–2003) and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (2012–2014) trilogies. Other notable film roles include &quot;A Touch of Love&quot; (1969), &quot;Plenty&quot; (1985), &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (1993), &quot;Restoration&quot; (1995), &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Good Liar&quot; (2019).

McKellen came out as gay in 1988, and has since championed LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of London in October 2014. McKellen is a cofounder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots. He is also patron of LGBT History Month, Pride London, Oxford Pride, GayGlos, LGBT Foundation and FFLAG.

== Early life and education ==
McKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire, the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior. Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951 after his father had been promoted. The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that &quot;only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn&#x27;t normal&quot;. When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: &quot;Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old&quot;.

McKellen&#x27;s father was a civil engineer and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent. Both of McKellen&#x27;s grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a &quot;strict, evangelical Protestant minister&quot; in Ballymena, County Antrim. His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. &quot;My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met&quot;. When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 25. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a Quaker, he said, &quot;Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people&#x27;s sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn&#x27;t lying any more&quot;. His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a &quot;grandfather of the modern weekend&quot;.

McKellen attended Bolton School (Boys&#x27; Division), of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen&#x27;s acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron. An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three. When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s reenactment of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

His sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, by the amateurs of Wigan&#x27;s Little Theatre, shortly followed by their &quot;Macbeth&quot; and Wigan High School for Girls&#x27; production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.

In 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he read English literature. He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the college. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in &quot;Henry IV&quot; alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), &quot;Cymbeline&quot; (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;. During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a significant impact on McKellen&#x27;s future career.

==Career==
=== 1965–1985: National Theatre acclaim ===

McKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, as Roper in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series. After four years in regional repertory theatres, McKellen made his first West End appearance, in &quot;A Scent of Flowers&quot;, regarded as a &quot;notable success&quot;. In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot; (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh Festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward&#x27;s lurid death.

One of McKellen&#x27;s first major roles on television was as the title character in the BBC&#x27;s 1966 adaptation of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, which achieved 12 million viewers on its initial airings. After some rebroadcasting in the late 60s, the master videotapes for the serial were wiped, and only four scattered episodes (3, 8, 9 and 11) survive as telerecordings, three of which feature McKellen as adult David. McKellen had taken film roles throughout his career—beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in &quot;A Touch of Love&quot;, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in &quot;Priest of Love&quot;, but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films. In 1969, McKellen starred in three films, Michael Hayes&#x27;s &quot;The Promise&quot;, Clive Donner&#x27;s epic film &quot;Alfred the Great&quot;, and Waris Hussein&#x27;s &quot;A Touch of Love&quot; (1969).

In the 1970s, McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles. From 1973 to 1974, McKellen toured the United Kingdom and Brooklyn Academy of Music portraying Lady Wishfort&#x27;s Footman, Kruschov, and Edgar in the William Congreve comedy &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, Anton Chekov&#x27;s comedic three-act play &quot;The Wood Demon&quot; and William Shakespeare tragedy &quot;King Lear&quot;. The following year, he starred in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King John&quot;, George Colman&#x27;s &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot;, and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Too True to Be Good&quot;. From 1976 to 1977 he portrayed Romeo in the Shakespeare romance &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The following year he played King Leontes in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

In 1976, McKellen played the title role in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; at Stratford in a &quot;gripping ... out of the ordinary&quot; production, with Judi Dench, and Iago in &quot;Othello&quot;, in award-winning productions directed by Trevor Nunn. Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn. From 1978 to 1979 he toured in a double feature production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and Anton Chekov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; portraying Sir Toby Belch and Andrei, respectively. In 1979, McKellen gained acclaim for his role as Antonio Salieri in the Broadway transfer production of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Amadeus&quot;. It was an immensely popular play produced by the National Theatre originally starring Paul Scofield. The transfer starred McKellen, Tim Curry as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Jane Seymour as Constanze Mozart. &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Frank Rich wrote of McKellen&#x27;s performance &quot;In Mr. McKellen&#x27;s superb performance, Salieri&#x27;s descent into madness was portrayed in dark notes of almost bone-rattling terror&quot;. For his performance, McKellen received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.

In 1981, McKellen portrayed writer and poet D. H. Lawrence in the Christopher Miles directed biographical film, &quot;Priest of Love&quot;. He followed up with Michael Mann&#x27;s horror film &quot;The Keep&quot; (1983). In 1985, he starred in &quot;Plenty&quot;, the film adaptation of the David Hare play of the same name. The film was directed by Fred Schepisi and starred Meryl Streep, Charles Dance, John Gielgud, and Sting. The film spans nearly 20 years from the early 1940s to the 1960s, around an Englishwoman&#x27;s experiences as a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II when she has a one-night stand with a British intelligence agent. The film received mixed reviews with Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praising the film&#x27;s ensemble cast writing, &quot;The performances in the movie supply one brilliant solo after another; most of the big moments come as characters dominate the scenes they are in&quot;.

=== 1986–2000: Established actor ===
In 1986, he returned to Broadway in the revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s first play &quot;Wild Honey&quot; alongside Kim Cattrall and Kate Burton. The play concerned a local Russian schoolteacher who struggles to remain faithful to his wife, despite the attention of three other women. McKellen received mixed reviews from critics in particular Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; who praised him for his &quot;bravura and athletically graceful technique that provides everything except, perhaps, the thing that matters most—sustained laughter&quot;. He later wrote, &quot;Mr. McKellen finds himself in the peculiar predicament of the star who strains to carry a frail supporting cast&quot;. In 1989 he played Iago in production of &quot;Othello&quot; by the Royal Shakespeare Company. McKellen starred in the British drama &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989) a fictionalised account of the Profumo affair that rocked the government of British prime minister Harold Macmillan. McKellen portrayed John Profumo. The film starred Joanne Whalley, and John Hurt. The film premiered at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or. When his friend and colleague, Patrick Stewart, decided to accept the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the American television series, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, McKellen strongly advised him not to throw away his respected theatrical career to work in television. However, McKellen later conceded that Stewart had been prudent in accepting the role, which made him a global star and later followed his example such as co-starring with Stewart in the &quot;X-Men&quot; superhero film series.

From 1990 to 1992, he acted in a world tour of a lauded revival of &quot;Richard III&quot;, playing the title character. The production played at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two weeks before continuing its tour where Frank Rich of &quot;New York Times&quot; was able to review it. In his piece, he praised McKellen&#x27;s performance writing, &quot;Mr McKellen&#x27;s highly sophisticated sense of theatre and fun drives him to reveal the secrets of how he pulls his victims&#x27; strings whether he is addressing the audience in a soliloquy or not&quot;. For his performance he received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.

In 1992, he acted in Pam Gems&#x27;s revival of Chekov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Royal National Theatre alongside Antony Sher, and Janet McTeer. In 1993, he starred in the film &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; based on the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award nominated play of the same name. McKellen starred alongside Will Smith, Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing. The film was a critical success. That same year, he also appeared in the western &quot;The Ballad of Little Jo&quot; opposite Bob Hoskins and the action comedy &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The following year, he appeared in the superhero film &quot;The Shadow&quot; with Alec Baldwin and the James L. Brooks directed comedy &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; starring Nick Nolte.

In 1995, McKellen made his screenwriting debut with &quot;Richard III&quot;, an ambitious adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same name, directed by Richard Loncraine. The film reimagines the play&#x27;s story and characters to a setting based on 1930s Britain, with Richard depicted as a fascist plotting to usurp the throne. McKellen stars in the title role alongside an ensemble cast including Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Broadbent, Kristen Scott Thomas, Nigel Hawthorne and Dame Maggie Smith. As executive producer he returned his £50,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle. In his review of the film, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen&#x27;s performance a &quot;lethally flamboyant incarnation&quot; and said his &quot;florid mastery ... dominates everything&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised McKellen&#x27;s adaptation and his performance in his four star review writing, &quot;McKellen has a deep sympathy for the playwright ... Here he brings to Shakespeare&#x27;s most tortured villain a malevolence we are moved to pity. No man should be so evil, and know it. Hitler and others were more evil, but denied out to themselves. There is no escape for Richard. He is one of the first self-aware characters in the theatre, and for that distinction he must pay the price&quot;. His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. That same year, he appeared in the historical drama &quot;Restoration&quot; (1995) also starring Downey Jr., as well as Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant, and David Thewlis. He also appeared in the British romantic comedy &quot;Jack and Sarah&quot; (1995) starring Richard E. Grant, Samantha Mathis, and Judi Dench.

In 1993, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin. Later that year, McKellen appeared in the HBO television film &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; based on the acclaimed novel of the same name about the discovery of HIV. For his performance as gay rights activist Bill Kraus, McKellen received the CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. From 1993 to 1997 McKellen toured in a one-man show entitled, &quot;A Knights Out&quot;, about coming out as a gay man. Laurie Winer from &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Even if he is preaching to the converted, McKellen makes us aware of the vast and powerful intolerance outside the comfortable walls of the theatre. Endowed with a rare technique, he is a natural storyteller, an admirable human being and a hands-on activist&quot;. From 1997 to 1998, he starred as Dr. Tomas Stockmann in a revival of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;. Later that year he played Garry Essendine in the Noël Coward comedy &quot;Present Laughter&quot; at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. In 1998, he appeared in the modestly acclaimed psychological thriller &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King. McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. That same year, he played James Whale, the director of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in the Bill Condon directed period drama &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot;, a role for which he was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, losing it to Roberto Benigni in &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; (1998).

In 1995, he appeared in the BBC television comedy film &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; starring Kate Beckinsale, Rufus Sewell, and Stephen Fry. The following year he starred as Tsar Nicholas II in the HBO made-for-television movie &quot;&quot; (1996) starring Alan Rickman as Rasputin. For his performance, McKellen earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination and received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film win. McKellen appeared as Mr Creakle in the BBC series &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1999) based on the Charles Dickens classic novel. The miniseries starred a pre-&quot;Harry Potter&quot; Daniel Radcliffe, Bob Hoskins, and Dame Maggie Smith.

=== 2000–2011: International stardom ===

In 1999, McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film &quot;X-Men&quot; and its sequels &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot; (2003) and &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006). He later reprised his role of Magneto in 2014&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;.

While filming the first &quot;X-Men&quot; film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (consisting of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;), released between 2001 and 2003. He won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films.

McKellen returned to the Broadway stage in 2001 in an August Strindberg play &quot;The Dance of Death&quot; alongside Helen Mirren and David Strathairn at the Broadhurst Theatre. &quot;The New York Times&quot; Theatre critic Ben Brantley praised McKellen&#x27;s performance writing, &quot;[McKellen] returns to Broadway to serve up an Elysian concoction we get to sample too little these days: a mixture of heroic stage presence, actorly intelligence, and rarefied theatrical technique&quot;. McKellen toured with the production at the Lyric Theatre in London&#x27;s West End and to the Sydney Art&#x27;s Festival in Australia. On 16 March 2002, he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in a special British-themed episode entitled &quot;The Regina Monologues&quot;, along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television&#x27;s long-running British soap opera, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, fulfilling a lifelong ambition, where in 2015 he was gifted a cobble from the soap&#x27;s exterior set for his seventy-sixth birthday. He narrated Richard Bell&#x27;s film &quot;Eighteen&quot; as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson.

McKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as &quot;Emile&quot; (which was shot in three weeks following the &quot;X2&quot; shoot), &quot;Neverwas&quot; and &quot;Asylum&quot;. In 2006, he appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; opposite Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. During a 17 May 2006 interview on &quot;The Today Show&quot; with the &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; cast and director Ron Howard, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. McKellen responded, &quot;I&#x27;ve often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying &#x27;This is fiction&#x27;. I mean, walking on water? It takes ... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie—not that it&#x27;s true, not that it&#x27;s factual, but that it&#x27;s a jolly good story&quot;. He continued, &quot;And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they&#x27;ve seen it&quot;.

McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Extras&quot;, where he played himself directing Gervais&#x27;s character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2007, McKellen narrated the romantic fantasy adventure film &quot;Stardust&quot; starring Charlie Cox and Claire Danes, which was a critical and financial success. That same year, he lent his voice to the armoured bear Iorek Byrnison in the Chris Weitz-directed fantasy film &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; based on the acclaimed Philip Pullman novel &quot;Northern Lights&quot; and starred Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. The film received mixed reviews but was a financial success.
In 2007, he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;The Seagull&quot;, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, a remake of the 1967 cult series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. In 2009, he appeared in a very popular revival of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at London&#x27;s Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart. From 2013 to 2014, McKellen and Stewart starred in a double production of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; and Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; on Broadway at the Cort Theatre. &quot;Variety&quot; theatre critic Marilyn Stasio praised the dual production writing, &quot;McKellen and Stewart find plenty of consoling comedy in two masterpieces of existential despair&quot;. In both productions of Stasio claims, &quot;the two thespians play the parts they were meant to play&quot;. He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK. In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

=== Since 2012: Career expansion ===
McKellen reprised the role of Gandalf on screen in Peter Jackson&#x27;s three-part film adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; starting with &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; (2012), followed by &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot; (2013), and finally &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; (2014). Despite the series receiving mixed reviews, it emerged as a financial success. McKellen also reprised his role as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto in James Mangold&#x27;s &quot;The Wolverine&quot; (2013), and Singer&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014). In November 2013, McKellen appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 50th anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;. From 2013 to 2016, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom &quot;Vicious&quot; as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. The show&#x27;s original title was &quot;Vicious Old Queens&quot;. There are ongoing jokes about McKellen&#x27;s career as a relatively unsuccessful character actor who owns a tux because he stole it after doing a guest spot on &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; and that he holds the title of &quot;10th Most Popular &#x27;Doctor Who&#x27; Villain&quot;. Liz Shannon Miller of &quot;IndieWire&quot; noted while the concept seemed, &quot;weird as hell&quot;, that &quot;Once you come to accept McKellen and Jacobi in a multi-camera format, there is a lot to respect about their performances; specifically, the way that those decades of classical training adapt themselves to the sitcom world. Much has been written before about how the tradition of the multi-cam, filmed in front of a studio audience, relates to theatre, and McKellen and Jacobi know how to play to a live crowd&quot;.

In 2015, McKellen reunited with director Bill Condon playing an elderly Sherlock Holmes in the mystery film &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot; alongside Laura Linney. In the film based on the novel &quot;A Slight Trick of the Mind&quot; (2005), Holmes now 93, struggles to recall the details of his final case because his mind is slowly deteriorating. The film premiered at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival with McKellen receiving acclaim for his performance. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; film critic Peter Travers praised his performance writing, &quot;Don&#x27;t think you can take another Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes? Snap out of it. Apologies to Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch, but what Ian McKellen does with Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s fictional detective in Mr Holmes is nothing short of magnificent ... Director Bill Condon, who teamed superbly with McKellen on the Oscar-winning Gods and Monsters, brings us a riveting character study of a lion not going gentle into winter&quot;. In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins&#x27;s Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood&#x27;s &quot;The Dresser&quot;, alongside Edward Fox, Vanessa Kirby, and Emily Watson. Television critic Tim Goodman of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised the film and the central performances writing, &quot;there&#x27;s no escaping that Hopkins and McKellen are the central figures here, giving wonderfully nuanced performances, onscreen together for their first time in their acclaimed careers&quot;. For his performance McKellen received a British Academy Television Award nomination for his performance.
In 2017, McKellen portrayed in a supporting role as Cogsworth (originally voiced by David Ogden Stiers in the 1991 animated film) in the live-action adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; and &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot;) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. The film was released to positive reviews and grossed $1.2billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film, the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and the 17th highest-grossing film of all time. In 2017, McKellen appeared in the documentary &quot;McKellen: Playing the Part&quot;, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen&#x27;s life and career as an actor.

In October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at the Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his &quot;last big Shakespearean part&quot;. He performed the play at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End during the summer of 2018. McKellen voiced Dr. Cecil Pritchfield the child psychiatrist for Stewie Griffin in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Send in Stewie, Please&quot; in 2018. He appeared in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s historical drama &quot;All is True&quot; (2018) portraying Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, opposite Branagh and Judi Dench. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described his performance &quot;offer solid support&quot; and added that it&#x27;s a &quot;colossal, emphatically wigged cameo&quot;. To celebrate his 80th birthday, in 2019 McKellen performed in a one-man stage show titled &quot;Ian McKellen on Stage: With Tolkien, Shakespeare, Others and YOU&quot; celebrating the various performances throughout his career. The show toured across the UK and Ireland (raising money for each venue and organisation&#x27;s charity) before a West End run at the Harold Pinter Theatre and was performed for one night only on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre.

In 2019, he reunited with Condon for a fourth time in the mystery thriller &quot;The Good Liar&quot; opposite Helen Mirren, who received praise for their onscreen chemistry. That same year, he appeared as Gus the Theatre Cat in the movie musical adaptation of &quot;Cats&quot; directed by Tom Hooper. The film featured performances from Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench. The film was widely panned for its poor visual effects, editing, performances, screenplay, and was a box office disaster. In 2021, he played the title role in an age-blind production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (having previously played the part in a UK and European tour in 1971), followed by the role of Firs in Chekov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. Since November 2021, McKellen and ABBA member Björn Ulvaeus have posted Instagram videos featuring the pair knitting Christmas jumpers and other festive attire. In 2023, it was revealed that Ulvaeus and McKellen would be knitting stagewear for Kylie Minogue as part of her &quot;More Than Just a Residency&quot; concert residency at Voltaire at The Venetian Las Vegas.

In 2023, he starred in the period thriller &quot;The Critic&quot; directed by Anand Tucker. The film is written by Patrick Marber adapted off the 2015 novel &quot;Curtain Call&quot; by Anthony Quinn. The film premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.

In April 2024, McKellen starred as John Falstaff in &quot;Player Kings (&quot;an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV Parts 1 and 2)&quot; opposite Richard Coyle and Toheeb Jimoh at the Noël Coward Theatre in London&#x27;s West End and received rave reviews (following runs at New Wimbledon Theatre and Manchester Opera House). The production was scheduled to run until 22 June before touring to Bristol, Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne, however during the performance on 17 June, McKellen fell off the front of the stage during a fight scene and called for assistance; the performance was cancelled and the audience dismissed. He was later reported to have recovered and to be &quot;in good spirits.&quot; He subsequently pulled out of the remaining West End and tour performances on medical advice.

==Personal life==
McKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964. Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in Earls Terrace, Kensington, London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. In 1978, he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, it was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen&#x27;s success in acting versus Mathias&#x27;s somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends, with Mathias later directing McKellen in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street. As of 2005, McKellen had been living in Narrow Street, Limehouse, for more than 25 years, more than a decade of which had been spent in a five-storey Victorian conversion.

McKellen is an atheist.

In the late 1980s, he lost his appetite for every kind of meat but fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.

In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).

McKellen has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. All but one of the other actors of &quot;The Fellowship&quot; (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo (John Rhys-Davies did not get the tattoo, but his stunt double Brett Beattie did).

McKellen was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006. In 2012, he stated on his blog that &quot;There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I&#x27;ve not needed any treatment&quot;.

McKellen became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013 to preside over the marriage of his friend and &quot;X-Men&quot; co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.

McKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014. He was made a Freeman of the City of London on 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. He was nominated by London&#x27;s Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was an &quot;exceptional actor&quot; and &quot;tireless campaigner for equality&quot;. He is also an emeritus Fellow of St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==Activism==

===LGBT rights===
While McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public while appearing on the BBC Radio programme &quot;Third Ear&quot; hosted by conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne. The context that prompted McKellen&#x27;s decision, overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career, was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament. Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality &quot;... as a kind of pretended family relationship&quot;. McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin. In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn&#x27;t engage myself in the politicking. He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight. Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until it was repealed in 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.

In 2003, during an appearance on &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, &quot;Fuck off, I&#x27;m gay&quot;. McKellen described Howard&#x27;s junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the &#x27;ugly sisters&#x27; of a political pantomime.

McKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented:
McKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots. McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month, Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation and FFLAG where he appears in their video &quot;Parents Talking&quot;.

In 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena&quot;: This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen&#x27;s knighthood was conferred. In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders. In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.

In 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one ... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.

McKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended. In December 2008, he was named in &quot;Out&quot; annual Out 100 list.

In 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool&#x27;s Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city. In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow&#x27;s mayor, a &quot;coward&quot; for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.

In 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.

===Charity work===
In April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.

A cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.

McKellen is an honorary board member for the New York City- and Washington, D.C.–based organisation Only Make Believe. Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children&#x27;s hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012 and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013. He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping down to his Lord of the Rings underwear on stage.

McKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour &quot;Shakespeare, Tolkien and You!&quot;, with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (&quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in 2010) and the locals&#x27; love for it made it a place worth supporting. In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.

Together with a number of his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; co-stars (plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson), on 1 June 2020 McKellen joined Josh Gad&#x27;s YouTube series &quot;Reunited Apart&quot; which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.

===Other work===
A friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to &quot;For Ian Charleson: A Tribute&quot;. A recording of McKellen&#x27;s voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum. He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

==Acting credits==

McKellen has received two Academy Award nominations for his performances in &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001).

<text>The Intellivision (a portmanteau of intelligent television) is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979. It distinguished itself from competitors with more realistic sports and strategic games. By 1981, Mattel Electronics had close to 20% of the domestic video game market, selling more than 3.75 million consoles and 20 million cartridges through 1983. At its peak Mattel Electronics had about 1800 employees in several countries, including 110 videogame developers. In 1984, Mattel sold its video game assets to a former Mattel Electronics executive and investors, eventually becoming INTV Corporation. Game development ran from 1978 to 1990, when the Intellivision was discontinued.

In 2009, IGN ranked the Intellivision No. 14 on their list of the greatest video game consoles of all time.

==History==
The Intellivision was developed at Mattel in Hawthorne, California. By 1969, multiple research and development groups came together as the Preliminary Design department on the third floor of the head office. Mattel had a history with technology R&amp;D as design engineer Jack Ryan, who joined the company in 1955 from Raytheon, led a group of engineers, chemists, sculptors. With a large budget they were expected to be forward thinking, dubbed the blue-sky group. 

===Master Component===
In 1975, mechanical engineer Richard Chang, a director under Ryan, contacted MOS Technology for a demonstration of their new 6502 microprocessor in a video game application. MOS arranged for their client Glenn Hightower of APh Technological Consulting and teacher at CalTech University to do the demonstration. Shortly after, Dave James, an industrial engineer under Chang, wrote a memo dated January 26, 1976, documenting two product concepts. First, a microprocessor programmed video system with &quot;plug-in&quot; ROM modules or cassettes, and a list of applications that include war games, gambling games, strategy and board games, video Etch-a-Sketch, driving simulator, pinball; and football with 10 player a side, defense/offense patterns and floating field background. Second, calculator based games. With Mattel executives skeptical, Chang&#x27;s group moved forward with handheld electronic games enlisting Hightower&#x27;s help with a prototype.

Mattel hired Michael Katz as Marketing Manager for New Product Categories in 1975, Katz asked Chang to prototype a calculator sized electronic game for 1976. In Fall 1976, Mattel hired Ed Krakauer as Vice President of New Business Development, who hired Jeff Rochlis as Director of New Business Development. In an October 1977 newspaper article, Rochlis was quoted saying, &quot;Basically these things are fore-runners of the home computer. There&#x27;s a logical transition involved. One way to get into the home-computer market is to sell games.&quot;

In April 1977, David Chandler, with a doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering, a career in Aerospace, also having prototyped an early word processor as well as an arcade video game, joined Prelimanary Design under Chang. Chandler shared Chang&#x27;s vision for a video game system with rich graphics and long-lasting gameplay to distinguish itself from its competitors and took over responsibility for its engineering. Prior to Chandler’s arrival, Chang&#x27;s group had already met with National Semiconductor about their new, although expensive, chip set. Chandler negotiated better pricing for a simpler design. At the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1977, Chandler saw two more chipsets. One from MOS Technology lacked moving objects. The other from General Instrument, listed as the Gimini programmable set in the GI 1977 catalog. The GI chipset lacked programmable graphics and Mattel worked with GI to implement changes. GI published an updated chipset in its 1978 catalog. Mattel initially chose National Semiconductor, who advised Mattel to postpone the project, turning them to GI. Mattel corporate management reacted by putting a halt to video game development for several months. On November 9, 1977, Mattel, GI, and Magnavox (their initial contract manufacturer) met to plan contracts and production.

With the 1977 success of their Mattel Electronics branded handheld electronic games, Mattel Electronics became a division within the company, with separate marketing, finance, and engineering. In September, Krakauer made Rochlis its president. Chang, becoming director of its new Design and Development department, responsible for Intellivision software. Chandler, became director of Product Engineering led a team engineering the hardware, including the hand controllers. In 1978, David Rolfe of APh developed the onboard executive control software named Exec, and with a group of Caltech summer student employees programmed the first Intellivision games. Hal Finney of APh contributed sound and music processing routines to the Exec. Graphics were designed by a group of artists at Mattel led by Dave James. James also creating detailed game proposal documents.

During June 1978 CES, Mattel privately showed a prototype to retailers, leading to a Christmas release. Delays at GI pushed that into 1979. Magnavox backed out as manufacturer, replaced with Sylvania. Chandler considered replacing the GI chipset and working with Texas Instruments and their new TMS9918 video processor. The TI chip had more moving objects but half the number on a horizontal line compared with the GI , it also lacked hardware scrolling that the GI provides. Further, the TI chip requires more RAM and software already developed would have to be reworked.

The Intellivision was introduced at the 1979 Las Vegas CES in January as a modular home computer with the Master Component priced at and a soon-to-follow Keyboard Component also at . At Chicago CES in June, prices were revised to for each component. A shortage of key chips from manufacturer General Instrument resulted in a limited number of Intellivision Master Components produced that year. In Fall 1979, Sylvania marketed its own branded Intellivision at in its GTE stores at Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. On December 3, Mattel delivered consoles to the Gottschalks department store chain headquartered in Fresno, California, with a suggested list price of . The Intellivision was also listed in the nationally distributed JCPenney Christmas 1979 catalog along with seven cartridges. By April 1980, markets expanded to Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago. It was in stores nationwide by mid-1980 with the pack-in game &quot;Las Vegas Poker &amp; Blackjack&quot; and a library of ten cartridges.

By September 1980, there was internal debate about the effectiveness of marketing the Intellivision as a home computer and the direction of Mattel Electronics questioned. Krakauer and Rochlis resigned, and Josh Denham became the new president of Mattel Electronics. The Keyboard Component was no longer promoted in advertising. A series of advertisements starring George Plimpton used side-by-side game comparisons to demonstrate the superior graphics and sound of Intellivision over the Atari 2600. One slogan called Intellivision &quot;the closest thing to the real thing&quot;. One such example compared golf games; where the 2600&#x27;s games had a blip sound and cruder graphics, the Intellivision featured a realistic swing sound and striking of the ball and a more 3D look. In 1980, Mattel sold out its 190,000 stock of Intellivision Master Components, along with one million cartridges. In 1981, more than one million Intellivision consoles were sold, more than five times the amount of the previous year. Mattel Electronics became a subsidiary and relocated to another building to accommodate their growth. In 1982, they sold 1.8 million Intellivisions.
The Intellivision Master Component was branded and distributed by various companies. Before Mattel shifted manufacturing to Hong Kong, Mattel Intellivision consoles were manufactured by GTE Sylvania. &quot;GTE Sylvania&quot; Intellivision consoles were produced along with Mattel&#x27;s, differing only by the brand name. The Sears Super Video Arcade, manufactured by Mattel in Hong Kong, has a restyled beige top cover and detachable controllers. Its default title screen lacks the &quot;Mattel Electronics&quot; captioning. In 1982, Radio Shack marketed the Tandyvision One, similar to the original console but with the gold plates replaced with more wood trim. In Japan, Intellivision consoles were branded for Bandai in 1982, and in Brazil there were Digimed and Digiplay consoles manufactured by Sharp in 1983.

===Software===
Inside every Intellivision console is 4K of ROM containing the Exec software. It provides two benefits: reusable code that can effectively make a 4K cartridge an 8K game and a software framework for new programmers to develop games more easily and quickly. It also allows other programmers to more easily review and continue another&#x27;s project. Under the supervision of David Rolfe at APh, and with graphics from Mattel artist Dave James, APh was able to quickly create the Intellivision launch game library using mostly summer students. The drawback is that to be flexible and handle many different types of games, the Exec runs less efficiently than a dedicated program. Intellivision games that leverage the Exec run at a 20 Hz frame rate instead of the 60 Hz frame rate for which the Intellivision was designed. Using the Exec framework is optional, but almost all Intellivision games released by Mattel Electronics use it and thus run at 20 Hz. The limited ROM space in the early years of Intellivision game releases also means there is no space for a computer player, so many early multiplayer games require two human players.

Initially, all Intellivision games were programmed by an outside firm, APh Technological Consulting, with 19 cartridges produced before Christmas 1980. Once the Intellivision project became successful, software development was brought in-house. Mattel formed its own software development group and began hiring programmers. The original five members of that Intellivision team were Mike Minkoff, Rick Levine, John Sohl, Don Daglow, and manager Gabriel Baum. Levine and Minkoff, a long-time Mattel Toys veteran, both transferred from the hand-held Mattel game engineering team. During 1981, Mattel hired programmers as fast as possible. Early in 1982 Mattel Electronics relocated from Mattel headquarters to an unused industrial building. Offices were renovated as new staff moved in. To keep these programmers from being hired away by rival Atari, their identities and work location was kept a closely guarded secret. In public, the programmers were referred to collectively as the Blue Sky Rangers.

Most of the early games are based on traditional real-world concepts such as sports, with an emphasis on realism and depth of play within the technology of the time. The Intellivision was not marketed as a toy; as such, games such as &quot;Sea Battle&quot; and &quot;B-17 Bomber&quot; are not made in the pick-up-and-play format like arcade games. Reading the instructions is often a prerequisite. Every cartridge produced by Mattel Electronics includes two plastic controller overlays to help navigate the 12-button keypad, although not every game uses it. Game series, or networks, are &quot;Major League Sports&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Strategy&quot;, &quot;Gaming&quot;, &quot;Children&#x27;s Learning&quot;, and later &quot;Space Action&quot; and &quot;Arcade&quot;. The network concept was dropped in 1983, as was the convenient gatefold-style box for storing the cartridge, instructions, and overlays.

Starting in 1981, programmers looking for credit and royalties on sales began leaving both APh and Mattel Electronics to create Intellivision cartridges for third-party publishers. They helped form Imagic in 1981, and in 1982 others joined Activision and Atari. Cheshire Engineering was formed by a few senior APh programmers including David Rolfe, author of the Exec, and Tom Loughry, creator of one of the most popular Intellivision games, &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot;. Cheshire created Intellivision games for Activision. Third-party developers Activision, Imagic, and Coleco started producing Intellivision cartridges in 1982, and Atari, Parker Brothers, Sega, and Interphase followed in 1983. The third-party developers, not having legal access to Exec knowledge, often bypassed the Exec framework to create smooth 30 Hz and 60 Hz Intellivision games such as &quot;The Dreadnaught Factor&quot;. Cheaper ROM prices also allowed for progressively larger games as 8K, 12K, and 16K cartridges became common. The first Mattel Electronics Intellivision game to run at 60 Hz was &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; in 1983. Marketing dubbed the term &quot;Super Graphics&quot; on the game&#x27;s packaging and marketing.

Mattel Electronics had a competitive advantage in its team of experienced and talented programmers. As competitors often depended on licensing well known trademarks to sell video games, Mattel focused on original ideas. Don Daglow was a key early programmer at Mattel and became director of Intellivision game development. Daglow created &quot;Utopia&quot;, a precursor to the sim genre and, with Eddie Dombrower, the ground-breaking sports simulation &quot;World Series Major League Baseball&quot;. Daglow was also involved with the popular Intellivision games &quot;Tron Deadly Discs&quot; and &quot;Shark! Shark!&quot;. After Mattel Electronics closed in 1984, its programmers continued to make significant contributions to the videogame industry. Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower went on to Electronic Arts to create &quot;Earl Weaver Baseball&quot;, and Don Daglow founded Stormfront Studios. Bill Fisher, Steve Roney, and Mike Breen founded Quicksilver Software, and David Warhol founded Realtime Associates.

===Keyboard Component===

The Intellivision was designed as a modular home computer; so, from the beginning, its packaging, promotional materials, and television commercials promised the addition of a forthcoming accessory called the Keyboard Component. The Master Component was packaged as a stand-alone video game system to which the Keyboard Component could be added, providing the computer keyboard and tape drive. Not meant to be a hobbyist or business computer, the Intellivision home computer was meant to run pre-programmed software and bring &quot;data flow&quot; (Videotex) into the home.

The Keyboard Component adds an 8-bit 6502 processor, making the Intellivision a dual-processor computer. It has 16K 10-bit shared RAM that can load and execute both Intellivision CP1610 and 6502 program code from tape, which is a large amount as typical contemporary cartridges are 4K. The cassettes have two tracks of digital data and two tracks of analog audio, completely controlled by the computer. Two tracks are read-only for the software, and two tracks are for user data. The tape drive is block addressed with high speed indexing. A high resolution 40×24 monochrome text display can overlay regular Intellivision graphics. There is a microphone port and two expansion ports for peripherals and RAM. The Microsoft BASIC programming cartridge uses one of these ports. Expanded memory cartridges support 1,000 pages of each. A third pass-through cartridge port is for regular Intellivision cartridges. It uses the Intellivision&#x27;s power supply.

David Rolfe of APh wrote a control program for the Keyboard Component called PicSe (Picture Sequencer) specifically for the development of multimedia applications. PicSe synchronizes the graphics and analog audio while concurrently saving or loading tape data. Productivity software for home finances, personal improvement, and self education were planned. Subject experts were consulted and their voices recorded and used in the software. Only two applications using the PicSe system were released on cassette tape: &quot;Conversational French&quot; and &quot;Jack Lalanne&#x27;s Physical Conditioning&quot;. Cassettes in development include &quot;Super Football&quot;, &quot;Spelling Challenge&quot;, &quot;Chartcraft Stock Analysis&quot;, and &quot;Jeanne Dixon Astrology&quot;.

Programs written in BASIC do not have access to Intellivision graphics and were sold at a lower price. Five BASIC applications were released on tape: &quot;Family Budgeting&quot;, &quot;Geography Challenge&quot;, and &quot;Crosswords I, II, and III&quot;.

The Keyboard Component was an ambitious piece of engineering for its time, and it was repeatedly delayed as engineers tried to reduce manufacturing costs. In August 1979, a breadboard form of the Component was successfully entered into the Sears Market Research Program. In December 1979, Mattel had production design working units but decided on a significant internal design change to consolidate circuit boards. In September 1980, it was test marketed in Fresno, California, but without software, except for the BASIC programming cartridge. In late 1981, design changes were finally implemented and the Keyboard Component was released at in Seattle and New Orleans only. Customers who complained in writing could buy a Keyboard Component directly from Mattel. The printer, a rebadged Alphacom Sprinter 40, was only available by mail order.

The Keyboard Component&#x27;s repeated delays became so notorious around Mattel headquarters that comedian Jay Leno, when performing at Mattel&#x27;s 1981 Christmas party, got his biggest response of the evening with the line: &quot;You know what the three big lies are, don&#x27;t you? &#x27;The check is in the mail&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;ll still respect you in the morning&#x27;, and &#x27;The keyboard will be out in spring.&#x27;&quot;

Complaints from consumers who had chosen to buy the Intellivision specifically on the promise of a &quot;coming soon&quot; personal-computer upgrade eventually caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), who started investigating Mattel Electronics for fraud and false advertising. Mattel explained to the FTC that the Keyboard Component was a failed product, avoiding fines. Mattel subsequently cancelled the product in August 1982, and offered to buy back all of the existing Keyboard Components from customers. Mattel provided a full refund, but customers without a receipt received for the Keyboard Component, for the BASIC cartridge, and for each cassette software. Any customer who opted to keep the products was required to sign a waiver with the understanding that no more software would be written for the system and absolving Mattel of any future responsibility for technical support. They were also compensated with worth of Mattel Electronics products.

Though approximately 4,000 Keyboard Components were manufactured, it is not clear how many of them were sold and they are rare. Many of the units were dismantled for parts. Others were used by Mattel Electronics programmers as part of their development system. A Keyboard Component could be interfaced with an Intellivision development system in place of the hand-built Magus board RAM cartridge. Data transfer to the Keyboard Component RAM is done serially and is slower than the Magus board parallel interface.

The keyboard component debacle was ranked as No. 11 on &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s &quot;25 dumbest moments in gaming&quot;.

===Entertainment Computer System (ECS)===
In mid-1981, Mattel&#x27;s upper management was becoming concerned that the Keyboard Component group would never be able to produce a sellable product. As a result, Design and Development set up a competing engineering team whose stated mission was to produce an inexpensive add-on called the &quot;Basic Development System&quot;, or BDS, to be sold as an educational device to introduce kids to the concepts of computer programming.

The rival BDS engineering group eventually came up with a much less expensive alternative. Originally dubbed the &quot;Lucky&quot;, from LUCKI: Low User-Cost Keyboard Interface, it lacked many of the sophisticated features envisioned for the original Keyboard Component. Gone, for example, was the 16K (8MB max) of RAM, the secondary CPU, and high resolution text; instead, the ECS offered a mere 2KB RAM expansion, a built-in BASIC that was marginally functional, plus a much-simplified cassette and printer interface. Ultimately, this fulfilled the original promise of turning the Intellivision into a computer, making it possible to write programs and store them to tape as well as interfacing with a printer. It even offered, via an additional sound chip (AY-3-8917) inside the ECS module and an optional 49-key music synthesizer keyboard, the possibility of turning the Intellivision into a multi-voice synthesizer which could be used to play or learn music.

In the fall of 1982, the LUCKI, now renamed the Entertainment Computer System (ECS), was presented at the annual sales meeting, officially ending the ill-fated keyboard component project. A new advertising campaign was aired in time for the 1982 Christmas season, and the ECS itself was shown to the public at the January 1983 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. However, it would not see release until late December as the &quot;Intellivision Computer Module&quot;.

Prior to release, an internal shake-up at the top levels of Mattel Electronics&#x27; management had caused the company&#x27;s focus to shift away from hardware add-ons in favor of software, and the ECS received very little in terms of furthering the marketing push. Further hardware developments, including a planned Program Expander that would have added another 16K of RAM and a more intricate, fully featured Extended-BASIC to the system, were halted. In the end, six games were released for the ECS; a few more were completed but not released.

The ECS Computer Module also offered four player game-play with the optional addition of two extra hand controllers. Four player games were in development when Mattel Electronics closed in 1984. &quot;World Cup Soccer&quot; was later completed and released in 1985 by Dextel in Europe and then INTV Corporation in North America. The documentation does not mention it but when the ECS Computer Adapter is used, &quot;World Cup Soccer&quot; can be played with one to four players, or two players cooperatively against the computer.

===Intellivoice===
In 1982, Mattel introduced the Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module, a speech synthesizer for compatible cartridges. The Intellivoice was novel in two respects: human sounding male and female voices with distinct accents, and speech-supporting games designed with speech as an integral part of the gameplay.

Like the Intellivision chipset, the Intellivoice chipset was developed by General Instrument. The SP0256-012 orator chip has 2KB ROM inside and is used to store the speech for numerical digits, some common words, and the phrase &quot;Mattel Electronics presents&quot;. Speech can also be processed from the Intellivoice&#x27;s SP650 buffer chip, stored and loaded from cartridge memory. That buffer chip has its own I/O and the Intellivoice has a 30-pin expansion port under a removable top plate. Mattel Electronics planned to use that connector for wireless hand controllers.

Mattel Electronics built a state of the art voice processing lab to produce the phrases used in Intellivoice games. However, the amount of speech that could be compressed into an 8K or 12K cartridge and still leave room for a game was limited. Intellivoice cartridges &quot;Space Spartans&quot; and &quot;B-17 Bomber&quot; did sell about 300,000 copies each, priced a few dollars more than regular Intellivision cartridges. However, at $79, the Intellivoice did not sell as well as Mattel expected; Intellivoices were later offered free with the purchase of a Master Component. In August 1983, the Intellivoice system was quietly phased out. A children&#x27;s title called &quot;Magic Carousel&quot; and foreign-language versions of &quot;Space Spartans&quot; were completed but shelved. Additional games &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; and &quot;Space Shuttle&quot; went unfinished with the voice recordings unused.

Four Intellivoice games were released: &quot;Space Spartans&quot;, &quot;B-17 Bomber&quot;, &quot;Bomb Squad&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

A fifth game, &quot;Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball&quot;, developed as part of the Entertainment Computer System series, also supports the Intellivoice if both the ECS and Intellivoice are connected concurrently. Unlike the Intellivoice-specific games, however, &quot;World Series Major League Baseball&quot; is also playable without the Intellivoice module (but not without the ECS).

===Intellivision II===
In the spring of 1983, Mattel introduced the &quot;Intellivision II&quot;, a cheaper, more compact redesign of the original, that was designed to be less expensive to manufacture and service, with updated styling. It also had longer controller cords. The Intellivision II was initially released without a pack-in game but was later packaged with BurgerTime in the United States and Lock&#x27;N&#x27;Chase in Canada. In 1984, the Digiplay Intellivision II was introduced in Brazil. Brazil was the only country outside North America to have the redesigned Intellivision II.

Using an external AC Adapter (16.2V AC), consolidating some ICs, and taking advantage of relaxed FCC emission standards, the Intellivision II has a significantly smaller footprint than the original. The controllers, now detachable, have a different feel, with plastic rather than rubber side buttons and a flat membrane keypad. Users of the original Intellivision missed the ability to find keypad buttons by the tactile feel of the original controller bubble keypad.

One functional difference was the addition of a video input to the cartridge port, added specifically to support the System Changer, an accessory also released in 1983 by Mattel that played Atari 2600 cartridges through the Intellivision. The Intellivision hand controllers could be used to play Atari 2600 games. The System Changer also had two controller ports compatible with Atari joysticks. The original Intellivision required a hardware modification, a service provided by Mattel, to work with the &quot;System Changer&quot;. Otherwise the Intellivision II was promoted to be compatible with the original.

It was discovered that a few Coleco Intellivision games did not work on the Intellivision II. Mattel secretly changed the Exec internal ROM program in an attempt to lock out third-party games. A few of Coleco&#x27;s early games were affected but the 3rd party developers quickly figured out how to get around it. Mattel&#x27;s own &quot;Electric Company Word Fun&quot;, however, will not run on the Intellivision II due to this change. In an unrelated issue but also due to Exec changes, Super Pro Football experiences a minor glitch where the quarterback does not appear until after the ball is hiked. There were also some minor changes to the sound chip (AY-3-8914A/AY-3-8916) affecting sound effects in some games. Programmers at Mattel discovered the audio differences and avoided the problem in future games.

===Decade===
As early as 1981, Dave Chandler&#x27;s group began designing what would have been Mattel&#x27;s next-generation console, codenamed &quot;Decade&quot; and now referred to as the &quot;Intellivision IV&quot;. It would have been based on the  32-bit MC68000 processor and a 16-bit custom designed advanced graphic interface chip. Specifications called for dual-display support, 240×192 bitmap resolution, 16 programmable 12-bit colors (4096 colors), antialiasing, 40×24 tiled graphics modes, four colors per tile (16 with shading), text layer and independent scrolling, 16 multicolored 16×16 sprites per scan-line, 32 level hardware sprite scaling. Line interrupts for reprogramming sprite and color registers would allow for many more sprites and colors on screen at the same time. It was intended as a machine that could lead Mattel Electronics into the 1990s; however, on August 4, 1983, most hardware people at Mattel Electronics were laid off.

===Intellivision III===
Also in 1981, Mattel Electronics executives indicated to APh, interest in a successor system for 1983. Although planned for some time, APh redirected staff efforts on the Intellivision III hardware around summer 1982. Based on a faster CP1610 for backward compatibility, APh developed an updated graphics STIC chip with 4x the resolution, more sprites, and more colors. Mattel Electronics programmers developing the EXEC software. When Mattel Electronics cancelled the project in mid-1983, Toshiba was laying out the new graphics chip, consoles expected to be in production by Christmas, cartridges to be ready by January 1984, according to Glenn Hightower of APh. A Mattel document titled Target Specification Intellivision III has the following.

*CPU: CP1610-2 at 3.56 MHz (2x original CPU speed)

* integrated Intellivoice

===Competition and market crash===
According to the company&#x27;s 1982 Form 10-K, Mattel had almost 20% of the domestic video-game market. Mattel Electronics provided 25% of revenue and 50% of operating income in fiscal 1982. Although the Atari 2600 had more third-party development, &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; reported after visiting the summer 1982 Consumer Electronics Show that &quot;the momentum is tremendous&quot;. Activision and Imagic began releasing games for the Intellivision, as did hardware rival Coleco. Mattel created &quot;M Network&quot; branded games for Atari&#x27;s system. The company&#x27;s advertisement budget increased to over for the year. In its October 1982 stockholders&#x27; report Mattel announced that &quot;Electronics&quot; had, so far that year, posted a nearly profit on nearly sales; a threefold increase over October 1981.

However, the same report predicted a loss for the upcoming quarter. Hiring still continued, as did the company&#x27;s optimism that the investment in software and hardware development would pay off. The &quot;M Network&quot; brand expanded to personal computers. An office in Taiwan was opened to handle Apple II programming. The original five-person Mattel game development team had grown to 110 people under new vice president Baum, while Daglow led Intellivision development and top engineer Minkoff directed all work on all other platforms. In February 1983, Mattel Electronics opened an office in the south of France to provide European input to Intellivision games and develop games for the ColecoVision. At its peak Mattel Electronics employed 1800 people.

Amid the flurry of new hardware and software development, there was trouble for the Intellivision. New game systems (ColecoVision and Atari 5200) introduced in 1982 took advantage of falling RAM prices to offer graphics closer to arcade quality. In 1983, the price of home computers, particularly the Commodore 64, came down drastically to compete with video game system sales. The market became flooded with hardware and software, and retailers were ill-equipped to cope. In spring 1983, hiring at Mattel Electronics came to a halt.

At the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Mattel Electronics had the opportunity to show off all their new products. The response was underwhelming. Several people in top management positions were replaced due to massive losses. On July 12, 1983, Mattel Electronics President Josh Denham was replaced with outsider Mack Morris. Morris brought in former Mattel Electronics president and marketing director Jeff Rochlis as a consultant and all projects were under review. The Intellivision III was cancelled and then all new hardware development was stopped when 660 jobs were cut on August 4. The price of the Intellivision II (which launched at earlier that year) was lowered to , and Mattel Electronics was to be a software company. However, by October 1983, Electronics&#x27; losses were over for the year and one third of the programming staff were laid off. Another third were gone by November, and, on January 20, 1984, the remaining programming staff were laid off. The Taiwan and French offices continued a little while longer due to contract and legal obligations. On February 4, 1984, Mattel sold the Intellivision business for . In 1983, 750,000 Intellivision Master Components were sold, compared to 1.8 million in 1982.

===INTV Corporation (1984–1990)===
Former Mattel Electronics Senior Vice President of Marketing, Terrence Valeski, understood that although losses were huge, the demand for video games increased in 1983. Valeski found investors and purchased the rights to Intellivision, the games, and inventory from Mattel. A new company, Intellivision Inc, was formed and by the end of 1984 Valeski bought out the other investors and changed the name to INTV Corporation. They continued to supply the large toy stores and sold games through direct mail order. At first they sold the existing inventory of games and Intellivision II systems. When the inventory of games sold out they produced more, but without the Mattel name or unnecessary licenses on the printed materials. To lower costs, the boxes, instructions, and overlays were produced at lower quality compared to Mattel.

In France, the Mattel Electronics office found investors and became Nice Ideas in April 1984. They continued to work on Intellivision, Colecovision, and other computer games. They produced Intellivision &quot;World Cup Soccer&quot; and &quot;Championship Tennis&quot;, both released in 1985 by European publisher Dextel.

In 1985, INTV Corporation introduced the &quot;INTV System III&quot;, also branded as the &quot;Intellivision Super Pro System&quot;, using the same design as the original Intellivision model but in black and silver. That same year INTV Corp introduced two new games that were completed at Mattel but not released: &quot;Thunder Castle&quot; and &quot;World Championship Baseball&quot;. With their early success INTV Corp decided to produce new games and in 1986 introduced &quot;Super Pro Football&quot;, an update of Mattel &quot;NFL Football&quot;. INTV Corp continued a relationship that Mattel had with Data East and produced all new cartridges such as &quot;Commando&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Body Slam Wrestling&quot; in 1988. Also in 1987, INTV Corp released &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, purchased from Atari where the game was completed but not released in 1984. They also got into producing next-generation games with the production of &quot;Monster Truck Rally&quot; for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1991, also released as &quot;Stadium Mud Buggies&quot; for Intellivision in 1989.

Licensing agreements with Nintendo and Sega required INTV Corporation to discontinue the Intellivision in 1990. INTV Corporation did publish 21 new Intellivision cartridges bringing the Intellivision library to a total of 124 cartridges plus one compilation cartridge.

===Tutorvision===

In 1989, INTV Corp and World Book Encyclopedia entered into an agreement to manufacture an educational video game system called Tutorvision. It is a modified Intellivision, the case molded in light beige with gold and blue trim. The Exec ROM expanded, system RAM increased to 1.75K, and graphics RAM increased to 2KB. That is enough graphics RAM to define unique graphic tiles for the entire screen.

Games were designed by World Book, &quot;J. Hakansson Associates&quot;, and programmed by Realtime Associates. Sixteen games were in production, plus one Canadian variation. However, the cartridges and the Tutorvision were never released; instead World Book and INTV Corporation sued each other. In 1990, INTV Corporation filed for bankruptcy protection and closed in 1991.

An unknown number of later Intellivision SuperPro systems have Tutorvision hardware inside. A subset of these units contain the full Tutorvision EXEC and can play Tutorvision games.

*12-button numeric keypad (0–9, &quot;clear&quot;, and &quot;enter&quot;)
*Four side-located action buttons (two for left handed players, two for right handed players)
**&quot;top two side buttons are electronically the same, giving three distinct buttons&quot;
*A directional pad, capable of detecting 16 directions of movement
*Plastic overlays that slide into place as an extra layer on the keypad to show game-specific key functions

The directional pad was called a &quot;control disc&quot; and marketed as having the &quot;functionality of both a joystick and a paddle&quot;. The controller was ranked the fourth worst video game controller by IGN editor Craig Harris.

==Reception==
A July 1980 article in Video magazine said &quot;Now, arcade addicts can revel in the most sophisticated games this side of the complex simulations designed for high-level computers right in their own livingrooms.&quot;, &quot;It may not be perfect but it&#x27;s certainly the best unit offered so far to players of electronic video games.&quot;, &quot;Those used to joysticks will have to endure a short period of adjustment, but even finicky players will be forced to agree that the company has developed a truly elegant solution to the controller problem.&quot;

Ken Uston published &quot;Ken Uston&#x27;s Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games&quot; in 1982 as a guide to potential buyers of console systems/cartridges, as well as a brief strategy guide to numerous cartridge games then in existence. He described Intellivision as &quot;the most mechanically reliable of the systems… The controller (used during &quot;many hours of experimentation&quot;) worked with perfect consistency. The unit never had overheating problems, nor were loose wires or other connections encountered.&quot; However, Uston rated the controls and control system as &quot;below average&quot; and the worst of the consoles he tested (including Atari 2600, Magnavox Odyssey², Astrovision, and Fairchild Channel F).

Jeff Rovin lists &quot;Intellivision&quot; as one of the seven major suppliers of videogames in 1982 and mentions it as &quot;the unchallenged king of graphics&quot;, but says the controllers can be &quot;difficult to operate&quot;, mentions the fact that if a controller breaks the entire unit must be shipped off for repairs (since they did not detach at first), and explains that the overlays &quot;are sometimes so stubborn as to tempt one&#x27;s patience&quot; .

A 1996 article in &quot;Next Generation&quot; said the Intellivision &quot;had greater graphics power than the dominant Atari 2600. It was slower than the 2600 and had less software available, but it was known for its superior sports titles.&quot; A year later, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; assessed the Intellivision in an overview of older gaming consoles, remarking that the controllers &quot;were as comfortable as they were practical. The unique disk-shaped directional pad provided unprecedented control for the time, and the numeric keypad opened up new options previously unavailable in console gaming.&quot; They praised the breadth of the software library but said there was a lack of genuinely stand-out games.

==Legacy==
===Intellivision Lives!===

Intellivision games became readily available again when Keith Robinson and Stephen Roney, both former Intellivision programmers at Mattel Electronics, obtained exclusive rights to the Intellivision and games in 1997. That year they formed a new company, Intellivision Productions, and made &quot;Intellivision for PC Volume 1&quot; available as a free download. Intellivision games could be played on a modern computer for the first time. That download includes three Intellivision games and an MS-DOS Intellivision emulator that plays original game code. It was followed by &quot;Volume 2&quot; and another three games including &quot;Deep Pockets Super Pro Pool &amp; Billiards&quot;; a game completed in 1990 but never released until this download in 1997. In 2000, the &quot;Intellipack 3&quot; download was available with another four Intellivision games and emulators for Windows or Macintosh.

Intellivision Productions released &quot;Intellivision Lives!&quot; and &quot;Intellivision Rocks&quot; on compact disc in 1998 and 2001. These compilation CDs play the original game code through emulators for MS-DOS, Windows, and Macintosh computers. Together they have over 100 Intellivision games including never before released &quot;King of the Mountain, Takeover, Robot Rubble&quot;, &quot;League of Light&quot;, and others. Intellivision Rocks includes Intellivision games made by Activision and Imagic. Some games could not be included due to licensing, others simply used different titles to avoid trademarked names. The CDs are also a resource for development history, box art, hidden features, programmer biographies, video interviews, and original commercials.

Also in 1997, Intellivision Productions announced they would sell development tools allowing customers to program their own Intellivision games. They were to provide documentation, PC compatible cross-assemblers, and the &quot;Magus II&quot; PC Intellivision cartridge interface. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled but they did provide copies of &quot;Your Friend the EXEC&quot;, the programmers guide to the Intellivision Executive control software. By 2000 Intellivision hobbyists ultimately created their own development tools, including Intellivision memory cartridges.

In 2005, Intellivision Productions announced that new Intellivision cartridges were to be produced. &quot;Deep Pockets and Illusions will be the first two releases in a series of new cartridges for the Intellivision. The printed circuit boards, the cartridge casings, the boxes are all being custom manufactured for this special series.&quot; &quot;Illusions&quot; was completed at Mattel Electronics&#x27; French office in 1983 but never released. &quot;Deep Pockets Super Pro Pool &amp; Billiards&quot; was programmed for INTV Corporation in 1990 and only released as a ROM file in 1998. However, no cartridges were produced. Previously, in 2000, Intellivision Productions did release new cartridges for the Atari 2600 and Colecovision. &quot;Sea Battle&quot; and &quot;Swordfight&quot; were Atari 2600 games created by Mattel Electronics in the early 1980s but not previously released. &quot;Steamroller&quot; (Colecovision) was developed for Activision in 1984 and not previously released.

===Licensing Intellivision Games===
Also in 1999, Activision released &quot;A Collection of Intellivision Classic Games&quot; for PlayStation. Also known as &quot;Intellivision Classics&quot;, it has 30 emulated Intellivision games as well as video interviews of some of the original programmers. All of the games were licensed from Intellivision Productions and none of the Activision or Imagic Intellivision games were included. In 2003, Crave Entertainment released a PlayStation 2 version of Intellivision Lives! and then Xbox and GameCube version in 2004. In 2010, Virtual Play Games released Intellivision Lives! for the Nintendo DS including one never before released game, &quot;Blow Out&quot;. In 2008 Microsoft made Intellivision Lives! an available download on the Xbox Live Marketplace as an Xbox Original and playable on the Xbox 360.

In 2003, the Intellivision 25 and Intellivision 10 direct-to-TV systems were released by Techno Source Ltd. These are an all-in-one single controller design that plugs directly into a television. One includes 25 games the other ten. These Intellivision games were not emulated but rewritten for the native processor (NES-based hardware) and adapted to a contemporary controller. As such they look and play differently than Intellivision. In 2005 they were updated for two-player play as the Intellivision X2 with 15 games. They were commercially very successful altogether selling about 4 million units by end of 2006.

Several licensed Intellivision games became available to Windows computers through the GameTap subscription gaming service in 2005 including &quot;Astrosmash, Buzz Bombers, Hover Force, Night Stalker, Pinball, Shark! Shark!, Skiing and Snafu&quot;. Installation of the GameTap Player software was required to access the emulator and games. The VH1 Online Arcade made nine Intellivision games available in 2007. Using a Shockwave emulator these Intellivision games could be played directly through a web browser with Shockwave Player. In 2010, VH1 Classic and MTV Networks released 6 Intellivision games to iOS. Intellivision games were first adapted to mobile phones and published by THQ Wireless in 2001. On March 24, 2010, Microsoft launched the Game Room service for Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live. This service includes support for Intellivision games and allows players to compete for high scores via online leaderboards. At the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, Microsoft announced a version of Game Room for Windows Phone, promising a catalog of 44 Intellivision games. AtGames and its Direct2Drive digital store has Windows compatible Intellivision compilations available for download purchase.

===Intellivision Flashback===

The number of Intellivision games that can be played effectively with contemporary game controllers is limited. On October 1, 2014, AtGames Digital Media, Inc., under license from Intellivision Productions, Inc., released the Intellivision Flashback classic game console. It is a miniature sized Intellivision console with two original sized Intellivision controllers. While adapters have been available to interface original Intellivision controllers to personal computers, the Intellivision Flashback includes two new Intellivision controllers identical in layout and function to the originals. It comes with 60 (61 at Dollar General) emulated Intellivision games built into ROM and a sample set of plastic overlays for 10 games. The Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons games were included as &quot;Crown of Kings&quot; and &quot;Minotaur&quot;. As with many of the other Intellivision compilations, no games requiring third-party licensing were included.

===Intellivision Entertainment===
In May 2018, Tommy Tallarico announced that he acquired the rights to the Intellivision brand and games with plans to launch a new home video game console, the Intellivision Amico. A new company, Intellivision Entertainment, was formed with Tallarico serving as president. Intellivision Productions has been renamed Blue Sky Rangers Inc. and their video game intellectual property has been transferred to Intellivision Entertainment.

In 2021 Blaze Entertainment released a collection of twelve emulated Intellivision games for the Evercade systems. They released a second collection of twelve emulated Intellivision games in 2022.

===Atari SA===
On May 23, 2024, Atari SA announced the acquisition of the Intellivision brand and library from Intellivision Entertainment. The deal did not include the unreleased Intellivision Amico console nor the Intellivision Entertainment company itself, both of which would be renamed. However, that company would secure a licensing deal with Atari to continue to release newer versions of Intellivision titles for the Amico.

==Innovations==
*Intellivision can be considered the first 16-bit game console, as it has a 16-bit microprocessor with 16-bit registers, 16-bit RAM, and a 16-bit data bus.
*The first home console and one of the first video games to use a tile-based playfield. It allowed for the display of detailed graphics and colour with very little RAM.
*The Intellivision was also the first system to feature downloadable games with PlayCable in 1981.
*Intellivision was the first game console to provide real-time human voices in the middle of gameplay, courtesy of the Intellivoice module.
*The first game controller with a directional thumb pad. 
*The Intellivision was also the first game console or home computer to offer a musical synthesizer keyboard.
*Intellivision was also the first console to have a complete built-in character font. While Odyssey² had a limited character font (uppercase alphabet, numerals, and some other characters), Intellivision&#x27;s system font had complete upper- and lowercase alphabets, numerals, and almost all of the punctuation and symbols found on standard computer keyboards.
*&quot;Utopia&quot; (1982) is credited as the game that spawned the construction and management simulation genre.
*&quot;World Series Major League Baseball&quot; (1983) is considered to be the first sports simulation video game with a number of innovations: multiple views of a 3D calculated virtual play-field, statistical based game-play using real historical baseball player statistics, manager player substitutions, play-by-play speech, and save games or lineups to tape storage.

<doc id="15316" wikidata="Q7260" url="?curid=15316" title="Imperialism">
<text>Imperialism is the maintaining and extending of power over foreign nations, particularly through expansionism, employing both hard power (military and economic power) and soft power (diplomatic power and cultural imperialism). Imperialism focuses on establishing or maintaining hegemony and a more or less formal empire. While related to the concept of colonialism, imperialism is a distinct concept that can apply to other forms of expansion and many forms of government.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word &quot;imperialism&quot; originated from the Latin word , which means &quot;to command&quot;, &quot;to be sovereign&quot;, or simply &quot;to rule&quot;. The word “imperialism” was first produced in the 19th century to decry Napoleon III&#x27;s despotic militarism and his attempts at obtaining political support through foreign military interventions. The term became common in the current sense in Great Britain during the 1870s; by the 1880&#x27;s it was used with a positive connotation. By the end of the 19th century it was being used to describe the behavior of empires at all times and places. Hannah Arendt and Joseph Schumpeter defined imperialism as expansion for the sake of expansion.

The term was and is mainly applied to Western and Japanese political and economic dominance, especially in Asia and Africa, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars. Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organized around an imperial core and a periphery. This definition encompasses both nominal empires and neocolonialism.

==Versus colonialism==
The term &quot;imperialism&quot; is often conflated with &quot;colonialism&quot;; however, many scholars have argued that each has its own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one&#x27;s influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that imperialism operates from the centre as a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, while colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions; however, colonialism still includes invasion. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes between imperialism and colonialism by stating: &quot;imperialism involved &#x27;the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory&#x27;, while colonialism refers to the &#x27;implanting of settlements on a distant territory.&#x27; Contiguous land empires such as the Russian, Chinese or Ottoman have traditionally been excluded from discussions of colonialism, though this is beginning to change, since it is accepted that they also sent populations into the territories they ruled.

Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of &quot;another&quot;, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism&#x27;s core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state&#x27;s lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure, and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations. Few colonies remain remote from their mother country. Thus, most will eventually establish a separate nationality or remain under complete control of their mother colony.

The Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin suggested that &quot;imperialism was the highest form of capitalism&quot;, claiming that &quot;imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism&quot;.

==Age of Imperialism==
The Age of Imperialism, a time period beginning around 1760, saw European industrializing nations, engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world. 19th century episodes included the &quot;Scramble for Africa.&quot;
In the 1970s British historians John Gallagher (1919–1980) and Ronald Robinson (1920–1999) argued that European leaders rejected the notion that &quot;imperialism&quot; required formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region. Much more important was informal control of independent areas. According to Wm. Roger Louis, &quot;In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire &#x27;informally if possible and formally if necessary.&#x27;&quot; Oron Hale says that Gallagher and Robinson looked at the British involvement in Africa where they &quot;found few capitalists, less capital, and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion. Cabinet decisions to annex or not to annex were made, usually on the basis of political or geopolitical considerations.&quot;

Looking at the main empires from 1875 to 1914, there was a mixed record in terms of profitability. At first, planners expected that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items. Apart from the Indian subcontinent, this was seldom true. By the 1890s, imperialists saw the economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector. Overall, Great Britain did very well in terms of profits from India, especially Mughal Bengal, but not from most of the rest of its empire. According to Indian Economist Utsa Patnaik, the scale of the wealth transfer out of India, between 1765 and 1938, was an estimated $45 Trillion. The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies. Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires. France did slightly better. The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise. However, scandal after scandal regarding atrocities in the Congo Free State led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable. The Philippines cost the United States much more than expected because of military action against rebels.

Because of the resources made available by imperialism, the world&#x27;s economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I, making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.

Europe&#x27;s expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies, in combination with assuming political control by military and political means. The colonization of India in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus: there, the &quot;British exploited the political weakness of the Mughal state, and, while military activity was important at various times, the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance&quot; for the establishment of control over the subcontinent&#x27;s resources, markets, and manpower. Although a substantial number of colonies had been designed to provide economic profit and to ship resources to home ports in the 17th and 18th centuries, D. K. Fieldhouse suggests that in the 19th and 20th centuries in places such as Africa and Asia, this idea is not necessarily valid:

During this time, European merchants had the ability to &quot;roam the high seas and appropriate surpluses from around the world (sometimes peaceably, sometimes violently) and to concentrate them in Europe&quot;.

European expansion greatly accelerated in the 19th century. To obtain raw materials, Europe expanded imports from other countries and from the colonies. European industrialists sought raw materials such as dyes, cotton, vegetable oils, and metal ores from overseas. Concurrently, industrialization was quickly making Europe the centre of manufacturing and economic growth, driving resource needs.

Communication became much more advanced during European expansion. With the invention of railroads and telegraphs, it became easier to communicate with other countries and to extend the administrative control of a home nation over its colonies. Steam railroads and steam-driven ocean shipping made possible the fast, cheap transport of massive amounts of goods to and from colonies.

Along with advancements in communication, Europe also continued to advance in military technology. European chemists made new explosives that made artillery much more deadly. By the 1880s, the machine gun had become a reliable battlefield weapon. This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents, as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields (e.g. the Zulus in Southern Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879). Some exceptions of armies that managed to get nearly on par with the European expeditions and standards include the Ethiopian armies at the Battle of Adwa, and the Japanese Imperial Army of Japan, but these still relied heavily on weapons imported from Europe and often on European military advisors.

==Theories of imperialism==

Anglophone academic studies often base their theories regarding imperialism on the British experience of Empire. The term &quot;imperialism&quot; was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Supporters of &quot;imperialism&quot; such as Joseph Chamberlain quickly appropriated the concept. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.

Historians and political theorists have long debated the correlation between capitalism, class, and imperialism. Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as John A. Hobson (1858–1940), Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950), Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), and Norman Angell (1872–1967). While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on Europe, as well as contributing to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. 

In &quot;Imperialism: A Study&quot; (1902), Hobson developed a highly influential interpretation of imperialism that expanded on his belief that free-enterprise capitalism had a harmful effect on the majority of the population. In &quot;Imperialism&quot; he argued that the financing of overseas empires drained money that was needed at home. It was invested abroad because lower wages paid to workers overseas made for higher profits and higher rates of return, compared to domestic wages. So, although domestic wages remained higher, they did not grow nearly as fast as they might otherwise have. Exporting capital, he concluded, put a lid on the growth of domestic wages and the domestic standard of living. Hobson theorized that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation, while state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order. 

By the 1970s, historians such as David K. Fieldhouse and Oron Hale could argue that &quot;the Hobsonian foundation has been almost completely demolished.&quot; It was not businessmen and bankers but politicians who went with the stream of the masses. The modern imperialism was primarily a political product caused by the national mass hysteria rather than by the much-abused capitalists. The British experience failed to support it. Similarly, American Historian David Landes claims that businessmen were less enthusiastic about colonialism than statesmen and adventurers.

However, European Marxists picked up Hobson&#x27;s ideas wholeheartedly and made it into their own theory of imperialism, most notably in Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot; (1916). Lenin portrayed imperialism as the closure of the world market and the end of capitalist free-competition that arose from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. Later Marxist theoreticians echo this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism, which explained the World War as the battle between imperialists for control of external markets. Lenin&#x27;s treatise became a standard textbook that flourished until the collapse of communism in 1989–91.

Some theoreticians on the non-Communist left have emphasized the structural or systemic character of &quot;imperialism&quot;. Such writers have expanded the period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Colonization and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect—among other shifts in sensibility—a growing unease, even great distaste, with the pervasiveness of such power, specifically, Western power.

Walter Rodney, in his 1972 How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, proposes the idea that imperialism is a phase of capitalism &quot;in which Western European capitalist countries, the US, and Japan established political, economic, military and cultural hegemony over other parts of the world which were initially at a lower level and therefore could not resist domination.&quot; As a result, Imperialism &quot;for many years embraced the whole world – one part being the exploiters and the other the exploited, one part being dominated and the other acting as overlords, one part making policy and the other being dependent.&quot;

Imperialism has also been identified in newer phenomena like space development and its governing context.

==Issues==
===Orientalism and imaginative geography===

Imperial control, territorial and cultural, is justified through discourses about the imperialists&#x27; understanding of different spaces. Conceptually, imagined geographies explain the limitations of the imperialist understanding of the societies of the different spaces inhabited by the non–European Other.

In &quot;Orientalism&quot; (1978), Edward Said said that the West developed the concept of The Orient—an imagined geography of the Eastern world—which functions as an essentializing discourse that represents neither the ethnic diversity nor the social reality of the Eastern world. That by reducing the East into cultural essences, the imperial discourse uses place-based identities to create cultural difference and psychologic distance between &quot;We, the West&quot; and &quot;They, the East&quot; and between &quot;Here, in the West&quot; and &quot;There, in the East&quot;.

That cultural differentiation was especially noticeable in the books and paintings of early Oriental studies, the European examinations of the Orient, which misrepresented the East as irrational and backward, the opposite of the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of the Western world, as its inferior, not only increased the sense-of-self of the West, but also was a way of ordering the East, and making it known to the West, so that it could be dominated and controlled. Therefore, Orientalism was the ideological justification of early Western imperialism—a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other, non-white peoples.

===Cartography===
One of the main tools used by imperialists was cartography. Cartography is &quot;the art, science and technology of making maps&quot; but this definition is problematic. It implies that maps are objective representations of the world when in reality they serve very political means. For Harley, maps serve as an example of Foucault&#x27;s power and knowledge concept.

To better illustrate this idea, Bassett focuses his analysis of the role of 19th-century maps during the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;. He states that maps &quot;contributed to empire by promoting, assisting, and legitimizing the extension of French and British power into West Africa&quot;. During his analysis of 19th-century cartographic techniques, he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory. This provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain &quot;information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps&quot;.

Although cartographic processes advanced through imperialism, further analysis of their progress reveals many biases linked to eurocentrism. According to Bassett, &quot;[n]ineteenth-century explorers commonly requested Africans to sketch maps of unknown areas on the ground. Many of those maps were highly regarded for their accuracy&quot; but were not printed in Europe unless Europeans verified them.

===Expansionism===

Imperialism in pre-modern times was common in the form of expansionism through vassalage and conquest.

===Cultural imperialism===
The concept of cultural imperialism refers to the cultural influence of one dominant culture over others, i.e. a form of soft power, which changes the moral, cultural, and societal worldview of the subordinate culture. This means more than just &quot;foreign&quot; music, television or film becoming popular with young people; rather that a populace changes its own expectations of life, desiring for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama-series in North Korea. The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, which may oppose such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and of unauthorized satellite dishes, etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent – as part of Roman imperialism, local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.

Imperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics, and thus the term &quot;imperialism&quot; is frequently used in international propaganda as a pejorative for expansionist and aggressive foreign policy.

=== Religious imperialism===
Aspects of imperialism motivated by religious supremacism can be described as religious imperialism.

=== Psychological imperialism ===
An empire mentality may build on and bolster views contrasting &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; peoples and cultures, thus justifying and encouraging imperialist practices among participants.
Associated psychological tropes include the White Man&#x27;s Burden and the idea of civilizing mission ().

===Social imperialism===
The political concept social imperialism is a Marxist expression first used in the early 20th century by Lenin as &quot;socialist in words, imperialist in deeds&quot; describing the Fabian Society and other socialist organizations.
Later, in a split with the Soviet Union, Mao Zedong criticized its leaders as social imperialists.

== Justification ==
Stephen Howe has summarized his view on the beneficial effects of the colonial empires:

A controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds. In ancient China, Tianxia denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order. The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, tributary states, and finally ending with the fringe &quot;barbarians&quot;. Tianxia&#x27;s idea of hierarchy gave Chinese a privileged position and was justified through the promise of order and peace.

The purportedly scientific nature of &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism. Under this doctrine, the French politician Jules Ferry could declare in 1883 that &quot;Superior races have a right, because they have a duty. They have the duty to civilize the inferior races.&quot; J. A. Hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as: &quot;It is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e. by the races of highest &#x27;social efficiency&#x27;&quot;. The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries. These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories. Political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported imperialism. Ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state&#x27;s survival and this argument dominated the discipline of geopolitics for decades. British imperialism in some sparsely-inhabited regions applied a principle now termed Terra nullius (Latin expression which stems from Roman law meaning &#x27;no man&#x27;s land&#x27;). The British settlement in Australia in the 18th century was arguably premised on &quot;terra nullius&quot;, as its settlers considered it unused by its original inhabitants. The rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears still to have its impact. For example, throughout Latin America &quot;whiteness&quot; is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento (whitening) are common.

Imperial peripheries benefited from economic efficiency improved through the building of roads, other infrastructure and introduction of new technologies. Herbert Lüthy notes that ex-colonial peoples themselves show no desire to undo the basic effects of this process. Hence moral self-criticism in respect of the colonial past is out of place.

===Environmental determinism===
The concept of environmental determinism served as a moral justification for the domination of certain territories and peoples. The environmental determinist school of thought held that the environment in which certain people lived determined those persons&#x27; behaviours; and thus validated their domination. Some geographic scholars under colonizing empires divided the world into climatic zones. These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being. In contrast, tropical climates allegedly yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy. The tropical peoples were believed to be &quot;less civilized&quot; and in need of European guidance, therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission. For instance, American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone. Across the three major waves of European colonialism (the first in the Americas, the second in Asia and the last in Africa), environmental determinism served to place categorically indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said&#x27;s Orientalism as the west&#x27;s construction of the east as the &quot;other&quot;. According to Said, orientalism allowed Europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm, which justified its dominance over the essentialized Orient. Orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location.

==Anti-imperialism==
Anti-imperialism gained a wide currency after the Second World War and at the onset of the Cold War as political movements in colonies of European powers promoted national sovereignty. Some anti-imperialist groups who opposed the United States supported the power of the Soviet Union, such as in Guevarism, while in Maoism this was criticized as social imperialism.

=== Pan-African Movement ===
Pan-Africanism is a movement across Africa and the world that came as a result of imperial ideas splitting apart African nations and pitting them against each other. The Pan-African movement instead tried to reverse those ideas by uniting Africans and creating a sense of brotherhood among all African people. The Pan-African movement helped with the eventual end of Colonialism in Africa.

Representatives at the 1900 Pan African Conference demanded moderate reforms for colonial African nations. The conference also discussed African populations in the Caribbean and the United States and their rights. A total of six Pan-African conferences that were held, and these allowed the African people to have a voice in ending colonial rule.

==Imperialism by country==

===Rome===

The Roman Empire was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity, it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, ruled by emperors.

===Caliphate===

The Early Muslim conquests and the pan-islamic Caliphate have been described at religious imperialism motivated by Islamic supremacism.

===Belgium===

=== United Kingdom ===


==== England ====

England&#x27;s imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the 16th century as the Tudor conquest of Ireland began in the 1530s. In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year. With the establishment of trading posts in India, the British were able to maintain strength relative to other empires such as the Portuguese who already had set up trading posts in India.

==== Scotland ====

Between 1621 and 1699, the Kingdom of Scotland authorised several colonies in the Americas. Most of these colonies were either closed down or collapsed quickly for various reasons.

==== United Kingdom ====

Under the Acts of Union 1707, the English and Scottish kingdoms were merged, and their colonies collectively became subject to Great Britain (also known as the United Kingdom). The empire Great Britain would go on to found was the largest empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population. Its power, both military and economic, remained unmatched for a few decades.

In 1767, the Anglo-Mysore Wars and other political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy. By the year 1670 Britain&#x27;s imperialist ambitions were well off as she had colonies in Virginia, Massachusetts, Bermuda, Honduras, Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica and Nova Scotia.
Due to the vast imperialist ambitions of European countries, Britain had several clashes with France. This competition was evident in the colonization of what is now known as Canada. John Cabot claimed Newfoundland for the British while the French established colonies along the St. Lawrence River and claiming it as &quot;New France&quot;. Britain continued to expand by colonizing countries such as New Zealand and Australia, both of which were not empty land as they had their own locals and cultures. Britain&#x27;s nationalistic movements were evident with the creation of the commonwealth countries where there was a shared nature of national identity.

Following the proto-industrialization, the &quot;First&quot; British Empire was based on mercantilism, and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India. Its growth was reversed by the loss of the American colonies in 1776. Britain made compensating gains in India, Australia, and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies in about 1820. By the 1840s, the United Kingdom had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world. After losing its first Empire to the Americans, Britain then turned its attention towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, the United Kingdom enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe. Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; (&quot;British Peace&quot;), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. However, this peace was mostly a perceived one from Europe, and the period was still an almost uninterrupted series of colonial wars and disputes. The British Conquest of India, its intervention against Mehemet Ali, the Anglo-Burmese Wars, the Crimean War, the Opium Wars and the Scramble for Africa to name the most notable conflicts mobilised ample military means to press Britain&#x27;s lead in the global conquest Europe led across the century.

In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the &quot;workshop of the world&quot;. The British Empire expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America. Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During this century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.

A resurgence came in the late 19th century with the Scramble for Africa and major additions in Asia and the Middle East. The British spirit of imperialism was expressed by Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Rosebury, and implemented in Africa by Cecil Rhodes. The pseudo-sciences of Social Darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning and legitimation during this time. Other influential spokesmen included Lord Cromer, Lord Curzon, General Kitchener, Lord Milner, and the writer Rudyard Kipling. After the First Boer War, the South African Republic and Orange Free State were recognised by the United Kingdom but eventually re-annexed after the Second Boer War. But British power was fading, as the reunited German state founded by the Kingdom of Prussia posed a growing threat to Britain&#x27;s dominance. As of 1913, the United Kingdom was the world&#x27;s fourth economy, behind the U.S., Russia and Germany.

Irish War of Independence in 1919–1921 led to the сreation of the Irish Free State. But the United Kingdom gained control of former German and Ottoman colonies with the League of Nations mandate. The United Kingdom now had a practically continuous line of controlled territories from Egypt to Burma and another one from Cairo to Cape Town. However, this period was also one of emergence of independence movements based on nationalism and new experiences the colonists had gained in the war.

World War II decisively weakened Britain&#x27;s position in the world, especially financially. Decolonization movements arose nearly everywhere in the Empire, resulting in Indian independence and partition in 1947, the self-governing dominions break away from the empire in 1949, and the establishment of independent states in the 1950s. British imperialism showed its frailty in Egypt during the Suez Crisis in 1956. However, with the United States and Soviet Union emerging from World War II as the sole superpowers, Britain&#x27;s role as a worldwide power declined significantly and rapidly.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the &quot;imperialism&quot; (and the related term &quot;colonialism&quot;) has had a variety of contradictory meanings since the 19th century. In the late 19th and early 20th, to be an &quot;imperialist&quot; meant thinking of Canada as a part of the British nation not a separate nation. The older words for the same concepts were &quot;loyalism&quot; or &quot;unionism&quot;, which continued to be used as well. In mid-twentieth century Canada, the words &quot;imperialism&quot; and &quot;colonialism&quot; were used in English Canadian discourse to instead portray Canada as a victim of economic and cultural penetration by the United States. In twentieth century French-Canadian discourse the &quot;imperialists&quot; were all the Anglo-Saxon countries including Canada who were oppressing French-speakers and the province of Quebec. By the early 21st century, &quot;colonialism&quot; was used to highlight supposed anti-indigenous attitudes and actions of Canada inherited from the British period.

===China===


China was one of the world&#x27;s oldest empires. Due to its long history of imperialist expansion, China has been seen by its neighboring countries as a threat due to its large population, giant economy, large military force as well as its territorial evolution throughout history. Starting with the unification of China under the Qin dynasty, later Chinese dynasties continued to follow its form of expansions.

The most successful Chinese imperial dynasties in terms of territorial expansion were the Han, Tang, Yuan, and Qing dynasties.

===Denmark===

Denmark–Norway (Denmark after 1814) possessed overseas colonies from 1536 until 1953. At its apex there were colonies on four continents: Europe, North America, Africa and Asia. In the 17th century, following territorial losses on the Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark-Norway began to develop colonies, forts, and trading posts in West Africa, the Caribbean, and the Indian subcontinent. Christian IV first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark-Norway&#x27;s overseas trade, as part of the mercantilist wave that was sweeping Europe. Denmark-Norway&#x27;s first colony was established at Tranquebar on India&#x27;s southern coast in 1620. Admiral Ove Gjedde led the expedition that established the colony. After 1814, when Norway was ceded to Sweden, Denmark retained what remained of Norway&#x27;s great medieval colonial holdings. One by one the smaller colonies were lost or sold. Tranquebar was sold to the British in 1845. The United States purchased the Danish West Indies in 1917. Iceland became independent in 1944. Today, the only remaining vestiges are two originally Norwegian colonies that are currently within the Danish Realm, the Faroe Islands and Greenland; the Faroes were a Danish county until 1948, while Greenland&#x27;s colonial status ceased in 1953. They are now autonomous territories.

===France===
During the 16th century, the French colonization of the Americas began with the creation of New France. It was followed by French East India Company&#x27;s trading posts in Africa and Asia in the 17th century. France had its &quot;First colonial empire&quot; from 1534 until 1814, including New France (Canada, Acadia, Newfoundland and Louisiana), French West Indies (Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe, Martinique), French Guiana, Senegal (Gorée), Mascarene Islands (Mauritius Island, Réunion) and French India.

Its &quot;Second colonial empire&quot; began with the seizure of Algiers in 1830 and came for the most part to an end with the granting of independence to Algeria in 1962. The French imperial history was marked by numerous wars, large and small, and also by significant help to France itself from the colonials in the world wars. France took control of Algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850, concentrating chiefly in North and West Africa (French North Africa, French West Africa, French Equatorial Africa), as well as South-East Asia (French Indochina), with other conquests in the South Pacific (New Caledonia, French Polynesia). France also twice attempted to make Mexico a colony in 1838–39 and in 1861–67 (see Pastry War and Second French intervention in Mexico).

French Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire. As it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with France, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items, as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism. It also provided crucial manpower in both World Wars. It became a moral justification to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture. In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, Jules Ferry declared France had a civilising mission: &quot;The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior&quot;. Full citizenship rights – &quot;assimilation&quot; – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. Contrasting from Britain, France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority.

The French colonial empire of extended over at its height in the 1920s and had a population of 110 million people on the eve of World War II.

In World War II, Charles de Gaulle and the Free French used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate France. However, after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the Empire. France fought and lost a bitter war in Vietnam in the 1950s. Whereas they won the war in Algeria, de Gaulle decided to grant Algeria independence anyway in 1962. French settlers and many local supporters relocated to France. Nearly all of France&#x27;s colonies gained independence by 1960, but France retained great financial and diplomatic influence. It has repeatedly sent troops to assist its former colonies in Africa in suppressing insurrections and coups d&#x27;état.

====Education policy====
French colonial officials, influenced by the revolutionary ideal of equality, standardized schools, curricula, and teaching methods as much as possible. They did not establish colonial school systems with the idea of furthering the ambitions of the local people, but rather simply exported the systems and methods in vogue in the mother nation. Having a moderately trained lower bureaucracy was of great use to colonial officials. The emerging French-educated indigenous elite saw little value in educating rural peoples. After 1946 the policy was to bring the best students to Paris for advanced training. The result was to immerse the next generation of leaders in the growing anti-colonial diaspora centered in Paris. Impressionistic colonials could mingle with studious scholars or radical revolutionaries or so everything in between. Ho Chi Minh and other young radicals in Paris formed the French Communist party in 1920.

Tunisia was exceptional. The colony was administered by Paul Cambon, who built an educational system for colonists and indigenous people alike that was closely modeled on mainland France. He emphasized female and vocational education. By independence, the quality of Tunisian education nearly equalled that in France.

African nationalists rejected such a public education system, which they perceived as an attempt to retard African development and maintain colonial superiority. One of the first demands of the emerging nationalist movement after World War II was the introduction of full metropolitan-style education in French West Africa with its promise of equality with Europeans.

In Algeria, the debate was polarized. The French set up schools based on the scientific method and French culture. The Pied-Noir (Catholic migrants from Europe) welcomed this. Those goals were rejected by the Moslem Arabs, who prized mental agility and their distinctive religious tradition. The Arabs refused to become patriotic and cultured Frenchmen and a unified educational system was impossible until the Pied-Noir and their Arab allies went into exile after 1962.

In South Vietnam from 1955 to 1975 there were two competing powers in education, as the French continued their work and the Americans moved in. They sharply disagreed on goals. The French educators sought to preserving French culture among the Vietnamese elites and relied on the Mission Culturelle – the heir of the colonial Direction of Education – and its prestigious high schools. The Americans looked at the great mass of people and sought to make South Vietnam a nation strong enough to stop communism. The Americans had far more money, as USAID coordinated and funded the activities of expert teams, and particularly of academic missions. The French deeply resented the American invasion of their historical zone of cultural imperialism.

===Germany===

German expansion into Slavic lands begins in the 12th–13th-century (see Drang Nach Osten). The concept of Drang Nach Osten was a core element of German nationalism and a major element of Nazi ideology. However, the German involvement in the seizure of overseas territories was negligible until the end of the 19th century. Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire in 1871. Its Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck (1862–90), long opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits. He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves, that the German bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract Germany from its central interest, Europe itself.

However, public opinion and elite opinion in Germany demanded colonies for reasons of international prestige, so Bismarck was forced to oblige. In 1883–84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific. The establishment of the German colonial empire started with German New Guinea in 1884. Within 25 years, German South West Africa had committed the Herero and Namaqua genocide in modern-day Namibia, the first genocide of the 20th century.

German colonies included the present territories of in Africa: Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Namibia, Cameroon, Ghana and Togo; in Oceania: New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands and Samoa; and in Asia: Qingdao, Yantai and the Jiaozhou Bay. The Treaty of Versailles made them mandates under the control the Allied victors.
Germany also lost the portions of its Eastern territories that had Polish majorities to independent Poland as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. The Eastern territories inhabited by a German majority since the Middle Ages were torn from Germany and became part of both Poland and the USSR as a result of the territorial reorganization established by the Potsdam Conference of the Allied powers in 1945.

===Italy===
The Italian Empire (&quot;Impero italiano&quot;) comprised the overseas possessions of the Kingdom of Italy primarily in northeast Africa. It began with the purchase in 1869 of Assab Bay on the Red Sea by an Italian navigation company which intended to establish a coaling station at the time the Suez Canal was being opened to navigation. This was taken over by the Italian government in 1882, becoming modern Italy&#x27;s first overseas territory. By the start of the First World War in 1914, Italy had acquired in Africa the colony of Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, a large protectorate and later colony in Somalia, and authority in formerly Ottoman Tripolitania and Cyrenaica (gained after the Italo-Turkish War) which were later unified in the colony of Libya.

Outside Africa, Italy possessed the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey (following the Italo-Turkish War) and a small concession in Tianjin in China following the Boxer War of 1900. During the First World War, Italy occupied southern Albania to prevent it from falling to Austria-Hungary. In 1917, it established a protectorate over Albania, which remained in place until 1920. The Fascist government that came to power with Benito Mussolini in 1922 sought to increase the size of the Italian empire and to satisfy the claims of Italian irredentists.

In its second invasion of Ethiopia in 1935–36, Italy was successful and it merged its new conquest with its older east African colonies to create Italian East Africa. In 1939, Italy invaded Albania and incorporated it into the Fascist state. During the Second World War (1939–1945), Italy occupied British Somaliland, parts of south-eastern France, western Egypt and most of Greece, but then lost those conquests and its African colonies, including Ethiopia, to the invading allied forces by 1943. It was forced in the peace treaty of 1947 to relinquish sovereignty over all its colonies. It was granted a trust to administer former Italian Somaliland under United Nations supervision in 1950. When Somalia became independent in 1960, Italy&#x27;s eight-decade experiment with colonialism ended.

===Japan===

For over 200 years, Japan maintained a feudal society during a period of relative isolation from the rest of the world. However, in the 1850s, military pressure from the United States and other world powers coerced Japan to open itself to the global market, resulting in an end to the country&#x27;s isolation. A period of conflicts and political revolutions followed due to socioeconomic uncertainty, ending in 1868 with the reunification of political power under the Japanese Emperor during the Meiji Restoration. This sparked a period of rapid industrialization driven in part by a Japanese desire for self-sufficiency. By the early 1900s, Japan was a naval power that could hold its own against an established European power as it defeated Russia.

Despite its rising population and increasingly industrialized economy, Japan lacked significant natural resources. As a result, the country turned to imperialism and expansionism in part as a means of compensating for these shortcomings, adopting the national motto &quot;Fukoku kyōhei&quot; (富国強兵, &quot;Enrich the state, strengthen the military&quot;).

And Japan was eager to take every opportunity. In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan. For centuries, Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces. In 1871 the Mudan incident happened: Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that became shipwrecked. At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan, and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens. They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction: in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared, and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent, which was a success. The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese: not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese in the Formosa Expedition of 1867. Very few gave it much thought at the time, but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series. Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures, but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands. In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese, but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed, ambushed and 250 of their men were killed; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan, and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan. Eventually, the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan.

In 1875 Japan took its first operation against Joseon Korea, another territory that for centuries it coveted; the Ganghwa Island incident made Korea open to international trade. Korea was annexed in 1910. As a result of winning the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan took part of Sakhalin Island from Russia. Precisely, the victory against the Russian Empire shook the world: never before had an Asian nation defeated a European power, and in Japan it was seen as a feat. Japan&#x27;s victory against Russia would act as an antecedent for Asian countries in the fight against the Western powers for Decolonization. During World War I, Japan took German-leased territories in China&#x27;s Shandong Province, as well as the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands, and kept the islands as League of nations mandates. At first, Japan was in good standing with the victorious Allied powers of World War I, but different discrepancies and dissatisfaction with the rewards of the treaties cooled the relations with them, for example American pressure forced it to return the Shandong area. By the &#x27;30s, economic depression, urgency of resources and a growing distrust in the Allied powers made Japan lean to a hardened militaristic stance. Through the decade, it would grow closer to Germany and Italy, forming together the Axis alliance. In 1931 Japan took Manchuria from China. International reactions condemned this move, but Japan&#x27;s already strong skepticism against Allied nations meant that it nevertheless carried on.
During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Japan&#x27;s military invaded central China. Also, in 1938–1939 Japan made an attempt to seize the territory of Soviet Russia and Mongolia, but suffered a serious defeats (see Battle of Lake Khasan, Battles of Khalkhin Gol). By now, relations with the Allied powers were at the bottom, and an international boycott against Japan to deprive it of natural resources was enforced. A military move to gain access to them was deemed necessary, and so Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States to World War II. Using its superior technological advances in naval aviation and its modern doctrines of amphibious and naval warfare, Japan achieved one of the fastest maritime expansions in history. By 1942 Japan had conquered much of East Asia and the Pacific, including the east of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma (Myanmar), Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, part of New Guinea and many islands of the Pacific Ocean. Just as Japan&#x27;s late industrialization success and victory against the Russian Empire was seen as an example among underdeveloped Asia-Pacific nations, the Japanese took advantage of this and promoted among its conquered the goal to jointly create an anti-European &quot;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot;. This plan helped the Japanese gain support from native populations during its conquests especially in Indonesia. However, the United States had a vastly stronger military and industrial base and defeated Japan, stripping it of conquests and returning its settlers back to Japan.

===Netherlands===

The most notable example of Dutch imperialism is regarding Indonesia.

===Ottoman Empire===

The Ottoman Empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1922. In 1453, Mehmed the Conqueror captured Constantinople and made it his capital. During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational, multilingual empire, which invaded and colonized much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, the Caucasus, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa. Its repeated invasions, and brutal treatment of Slavs led to the Great Migrations of the Serbs to escape persecution. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states. Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.

Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined, losing control of much of its territory in Europe and Africa.

By 1810 Egypt was effectively independent. In 1821–1829 the Greeks in the Greek War of Independence were assisted by Russia, Britain and France. In 1815 to 1914 the Ottoman Empire could exist only in the conditions of acute rivalry of the great powers, with Britain its main supporter, especially in the Crimean War 1853–1856, against Russia. After Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro gained independence and Britain took colonial control of Cyprus, while Bosnia and Herzegovina were occupied and annexed by Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1908.

The empire allied with Germany in World War I with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it dissolved in the aftermath of its decisive defeat. The Kemalist national movement, supported by Soviet Russia, achieved victory in the course of the Turkish War of Independence, and the parties signed and ratified the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 and 1924. The Republic of Turkey was established.

===Portugal===

=== Russia ===

====Russian Empire====
By the 18th century, the Russian Empire extended its control to the Pacific, peacefully forming a common border with the Qing Empire and Empire of Japan. This took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east, west, and south of it. The Polish–Russian War of 1792 took place after Polish nobility from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth wrote the Constitution of 3 May 1791. The war resulted in eastern Poland being conquered by Imperial Russia as a colony until 1918. The southern campaigns involved a series of Russo-Persian Wars, which began with the Persian Expedition of 1796, resulting in the acquisition of Georgia as a protectorate. Between 1800 and 1864, Imperial armies invaded south in the Russian conquest of the Caucasus, the Murid War, and the Russo-Circassian War. This last conflict led to the ethnic cleansing of Circassians from their lands. The Russian conquest of Siberia over the Khanate of Sibir took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, and resulted in the slaughter of various indigenous tribes by Russians, including the Daur, the Koryaks, the Itelmens, Mansi people and the Chukchi. The Russian colonization of Central and Eastern Europe and Siberia and treatment of the resident indigenous peoples has been compared to European colonization of the Americas, with similar negative impacts on the indigenous Siberians as upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The extermination of indigenous Siberian tribes was so complete that a relatively small population of only 180,000 are said to exist today. The Russian Empire exploited and suppressed Cossacks hosts during this period, before turning them into the special military estate Sosloviye in the late 18th century. Cossacks were then used in Imperial Russian campaigns against other tribes.

The acquisition of Ukraine by Russia commenced in 1654 with the Pereiaslav Agreement. Georgia&#x27;s accession to Russia in 1783 was marked by the Treaty of Georgievsk.

====Soviet Union====
Bolshevik leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921, however with an internationalist ideology: Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self-determination for national minorities within the new territory. Beginning in 1923, the policy of &quot;Indigenization&quot; [korenizatsiya] was intended to support non-Russians develop their national cultures within a socialist framework. Never formally revoked, it stopped being implemented after 1932. After World War II, the Soviet Union installed socialist regimes modeled on those it had installed in 1919–20 in the old Russian Empire, in areas its forces occupied in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union and later the People&#x27;s Republic of China supported revolutionary and communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests, but were not always successful. The USSR provided great assistance to Kuomintang in 1926–1928 in the formation of a unified Chinese government (see Northern Expedition). Although then relations with the USSR deteriorated, but the USSR was the only world power that provided military assistance to China against Japanese aggression in 1937–1941 (see Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact). The victory of the Chinese Communists in the civil war of 1946–1949 relied on the great help of the USSR (see Chinese Civil War).

Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited traits common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation-states. Some also argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Josip Broz Tito and Milovan Djilas have referred to the Stalinist USSR&#x27;s foreign policies, such as the occupation and economic exploitations of Eastern Europe and its aggressive and hostile policy towards Yugoslavia as Soviet imperialism. Some Marxists within the Russian Empire and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism. The crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and Soviet–Afghan War have been cited as examples.

====Russia under Putin====
Since the 2010s, Russia under Vladimir Putin has been described as neo-imperialist. Russia occupies parts of neighboring countries and has engaged in expansionism, most notably with the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia, the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and annexation of its southeast. Russia has also established domination over Belarus. Four months into the invasion of Ukraine, Putin compared himself to Russian emperor Peter the Great. He said that Tsar Peter had returned &quot;Russian land&quot; to the empire, and that &quot;it is now also our responsibility to return (Russian) land&quot;. Kseniya Oksamytna wrote that in Russia media, the invasion was accompanied by discourses of Russian &quot;supremacy&quot;. She says that this likely fuelled war crimes against Ukrainians and that &quot;the behavior of Russian forces bore all hallmarks of imperial violence&quot;. The Putin regime has revived imperial ideas such as the &quot;Russian world&quot; and the ideology of Eurasianism. It has used disinformation and the Russian diaspora to undermine the sovereignty of other countries. Russia is also accused of neo-colonialism in Africa, mainly through the activities of the Wagner Group and Africa Corps.

===United States===

Made up of former colonies itself, the early United States expressed its opposition to imperialism, at least in a form distinct from its own Manifest Destiny, through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine. However the US may have unsuccessfully attempted to capture Canada in the War of 1812. The United States achieved very significant territorial concessions from Mexico during the Mexican–American War. Beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, policies such as Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s mission to &quot;make the world safe for democracy&quot; changed all this. They were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes. This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. In 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba. One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America&#x27;s occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos. American foreign policy was denounced as a &quot;racket&quot; by Smedley Butler, a former American general who had become a spokesman for the far left.

At the start of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was opposed to European colonialism, especially in India. He pulled back when Britain&#x27;s Winston Churchill demanded that victory in the war be the first priority. Roosevelt expected that the United Nations would take up the problem of decolonization.

Some have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism. This internal form is distinct from informal U.S. imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony. It also showed difference in the United States&#x27; formation of &quot;colonies&quot; abroad. Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism. This internal form of empire has been referred to as &quot;internal colonialism&quot;. Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America&#x27;s &quot;internal colonialism&quot;. However, this internal colonialism faced resistance, as external colonialism did, but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans. In a lecture on April 16, 2003, Edward Said described modern imperialism in the United States as an aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary Orient stating that &quot;due to their backward living, lack of democracy and the violation of women&#x27;s rights. The western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon&quot;.

=== Spain ===
Spanish imperialism in the colonial era corresponds with the rise and decline of the Spanish Empire, conventionally recognized as emerging in 1402 with the conquest of the Canary Islands. Following the successes of exploratory maritime voyages conducted during the Age of Discovery, Spain committed considerable financial and military resources towards developing a robust navy capable of conducting large-scale, transatlantic expeditionary operations in order to establish and solidify a firm imperial presence across large portions of North America, South America, and the geographic regions comprising the Caribbean basin. Concomitant with Spanish endorsement and sponsorship of transatlantic expeditionary voyages was the deployment of &quot;Conquistadors&quot;, which further expanded Spanish imperial boundaries through the acquisition and development of territories and colonies.

==== Imperialism in the Caribbean basin ====

In congruence with the colonialist activities of competing European imperial powers throughout the 15th – 19th centuries, the Spanish were equally engrossed in extending geopolitical power. The Caribbean basin functioned as a key geographic focal point for advancing Spanish imperialism. Similar to the strategic prioritization Spain placed towards achieving victory in the conquests of the Aztec Empire and Inca Empire, Spain placed equal strategic emphasis on expanding the nation&#x27;s imperial footprint within the Caribbean basin.

Echoing the prevailing ideological perspectives regarding colonialism and imperialism embraced by Spain&#x27;s European rivals during the colonial era, including the English, French, and the Dutch, the Spanish used colonialism as a means of expanding imperial geopolitical borders and securing the defense of maritime trade routes in the Caribbean basin.

While leveraging colonialism in the same geographic operating theater as its imperial rivals, Spain maintained distinct imperial objectives and instituted a unique form of colonialism in support of its imperial agenda. Spain placed significant strategic emphasis on the acquisition, extraction, and exportation of precious metals (primarily gold and silver). A second objective was the evangelization of subjugated indigenous populations residing in mineral-rich and strategically favorable locations. Notable examples of these indigenous groups include the Taίno populations inhabiting Puerto Rico and segments of Cuba. Compulsory labor and slavery were widely institutionalized across Spanish-occupied territories and colonies, with an initial emphasis on directing labor towards mining activity and related methods of procuring semi-precious metals. The emergence of the &quot;Encomienda&quot; system during the 16th–17th centuries in occupied colonies within the Caribbean basin reflects a gradual shift in imperial prioritization, increasingly focusing on large-scale production and exportation of agricultural commodities.

==== Scholarly debate and controversy ====
The scope and scale of Spanish participation in imperialism within the Caribbean basin remains a subject of scholarly debate among historians. A fundamental source of contention stems from the inadvertent conflation of theoretical conceptions of imperialism and colonialism. Furthermore, significant variation exists in the definition and interpretation of these terms as expounded by historians, anthropologists, philosophers, and political scientists.

Among historians, there is substantial support in favor of approaching imperialism as a conceptual theory emerging during the 18th–19th centuries, particularly within Britain, propagated by key exponents such as Joseph Chamberlain and Benjamin Disraeli. In accordance with this theoretical perspective, the activities of the Spanish in the Caribbean are not components of a preeminent, ideologically driven form of imperialism. Rather, these activities are more accurately classified as representing a form of colonialism.

Further divergence among historians can be attributed to varying theoretical perspectives regarding imperialism that are proposed by emerging academic schools of thought. Noteworthy examples include cultural imperialism, whereby proponents such as John Downing and Annabelle Sreberny-Modammadi define imperialism as &quot;...the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one.&quot; Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force.&quot; Moreover, colonialism is understood as &quot;...the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners.&quot;

In spite of diverging perspectives and the absence of a unilateral scholarly consensus regarding imperialism among historians, within the context of Spanish expansion in the Caribbean basin during the colonial era, imperialism can be interpreted as an overarching ideological agenda that is perpetuated through the institution of colonialism. In this context, colonialism functions as an instrument designed to achieve specific imperialist objectives.
