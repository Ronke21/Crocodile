<text>My Fair Lady is a musical with a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. The story, based on George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s 1913 play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and on the 1938 film adaptation of the play, concerns Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl who takes speech lessons from professor Henry Higgins, a phonetician, so that she may pass as a lady. Despite his cynical nature and difficulty understanding women, Higgins grows attached to her.

The musical&#x27;s 1956 Broadway production was a notable critical and popular success, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. It set a record for the longest run of any musical on Broadway up to that time and was followed by a hit London production. Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews starred in both productions. Many revivals have followed, and the 1964 film version won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Plot==
===Act I===
In Edwardian London, Eliza Doolittle is a flower girl with a thick Cockney accent. The noted phonetician Professor Henry Higgins encounters Eliza at Covent Garden and laments the vulgarity of her dialect (&quot;Why Can&#x27;t the English?&quot;). Higgins also meets Colonel Pickering, another linguist, and invites him to stay as his houseguest. Eliza and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable life (&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Loverly?&quot;).

Eliza&#x27;s dustman father, Alfred P. Doolittle, stops by the next morning searching for money for a drink (&quot;With a Little Bit of Luck&quot;). Soon after, Eliza comes to Higgins&#x27;s house, seeking elocution lessons so that she can get a job as an assistant in a florist&#x27;s shop. Higgins wagers Pickering that, within six months, by teaching Eliza to speak properly, he will enable her to pass for a proper lady.

Eliza becomes part of Higgins&#x27;s household. Though Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted man who merely cannot get along with women (&quot;I&#x27;m an Ordinary Man&quot;), to others he appears self-absorbed and misogynistic. Eliza endures Higgins&#x27;s tyrannical speech tutoring. Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill him (&quot;Just You Wait&quot;). Higgins&#x27;s servants lament the stressful atmosphere (&quot;The Servants&#x27; Chorus&quot;).

Just as Higgins is about to give up on her, Eliza suddenly recites one of her diction exercises in perfect upper-class style (&quot;The Rain in Spain&quot;). Though Mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed, she declares she is too excited to sleep (&quot;I Could Have Danced All Night&quot;).

For her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother&#x27;s box at Ascot Racecourse (&quot;Ascot Gavotte&quot;). Though Eliza shocks everyone when she forgets herself while watching a race and reverts to foul language, she does capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill. Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, and he declares that he will wait for her in the street outside Higgins&#x27; house (&quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot;).

Eliza&#x27;s final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball. After more weeks of preparation, she is ready. (&quot;Eliza&#x27;s Entrance&quot;). All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of Transylvania invites her to dance with the prince (&quot;Embassy Waltz&quot;). A Hungarian phonetician, Zoltan Karpathy, attempts to discover Eliza&#x27;s origins. Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza.

===Act II===
The ball is a success; Karpathy has declared Eliza to be a Hungarian princess. Pickering and Higgins revel in their triumph (&quot;You Did It&quot;), failing to pay attention to Eliza. Eliza is insulted at receiving no credit for her success, packing up and leaving the Higgins house. As she leaves she finds Freddy, who begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she tells him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it (&quot;Show Me&quot;).

Eliza and Freddy return to Covent Garden but she finds she no longer feels at home there. Her father is there as well, and he tells her that he has received a surprise bequest from an American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry his lover. Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding (&quot;Get Me to the Church on Time&quot;).

Higgins awakens the next morning. He finds himself out of sorts without Eliza. He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women (&quot;A Hymn to Him&quot;). Col. Pickering is concerned about Eliza&#x27;s well-being, calling the police as well as contacting an old chum he believes will help them track her down.

Higgins despondently visits his mother&#x27;s house, where he finds Eliza. Eliza declares she no longer needs Higgins (&quot;Without You&quot;). As Higgins walks home, he realizes he&#x27;s grown attached to Eliza (&quot;I&#x27;ve Grown Accustomed to Her Face&quot;). At home, he sentimentally reviews the recording he made the day Eliza first came to him for lessons, hearing his own harsh words. Eliza suddenly appears in his home. In suppressed joy at their reunion, Professor Higgins scoffs and asks, &quot;Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?&quot;

==Background==
In the mid-1930s, film producer Gabriel Pascal acquired the rights to produce film versions of several of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s plays, &quot;Pygmalion&quot; among them. However, Shaw, having had a bad experience with &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot;, a Viennese operetta based on his play &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, refused permission for &quot;Pygmalion&quot; to be adapted into a musical. After Shaw died in 1950, Pascal asked lyricist Alan Jay Lerner to write the musical adaptation. Lerner agreed, and he and his partner Frederick Loewe began work. But they quickly realised that the play violated several key rules for constructing a musical: the main story was not a love story, there was no subplot or secondary love story, and there was no place for an ensemble. Many people, including Oscar Hammerstein II, who, with Richard Rodgers, had also tried his hand at adapting &quot;Pygmalion&quot; into a musical and had given up, told Lerner that converting the play to a musical was impossible, so he and Loewe abandoned the project for two years.

During this time, the collaborators separated, and Pascal died. Lerner had been trying to musicalize &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; when he read Pascal&#x27;s obituary and found himself thinking about &quot;Pygmalion&quot; again. When he and Loewe reunited, everything fell into place. All of the insurmountable obstacles that had stood in their way two years earlier disappeared when the team realized that the play needed few changes apart from (according to Lerner) &quot;adding the action that took place between the acts of the play&quot;. They then excitedly began writing the show. However, Chase Manhattan Bank was in charge of Pascal&#x27;s estate, and the musical rights to &quot;Pygmalion&quot; were sought both by Lerner and Loewe and by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, whose executives called Lerner to discourage him from challenging the studio. Loewe decided, &quot;We will write the show without the rights, and when the time comes for them to decide who is to get them, we will be so far ahead of everyone else that they will be forced to give them to us.&quot; For five months Lerner and Loewe wrote, hired technical designers, and made casting decisions. The bank, in the end, granted them the musical rights.

Various titles were suggested for the musical. Dominic McHugh wrote: &quot;During the autumn of 1955, the show [was] typically referred to as &quot;My Lady Liza&quot;, and most of the contracts refer to this as the title.&quot; Lerner preferred &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, relating both to one of Shaw&#x27;s provisional titles for &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and to the final line of every verse of the nursery rhyme &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;. Recalling that the Gershwins&#x27; 1925 musical &quot;Tell Me More&quot; had been titled &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in its out-of-town tryout, and also had a musical number under that title, Lerner made a courtesy call to Ira Gershwin, alerting him to the use of the title for the Lerner and Loewe musical.

Noël Coward was the first to be offered the role of Henry Higgins, but he turned it down, suggesting the producers cast Rex Harrison instead. After much deliberation, Harrison agreed to accept the part. Mary Martin was an early choice for the role of Eliza Doolittle, but declined the role. Young actress Julie Andrews was &quot;discovered&quot; and cast as Eliza after the show&#x27;s creative team went to see her Broadway debut in &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. Moss Hart agreed to direct after hearing only two songs. The experienced orchestrators Robert Russell Bennett and Philip J. Lang were entrusted with the arrangements, and the show quickly went into rehearsal.

The musical&#x27;s script used several scenes that Shaw had written especially for the 1938 film version of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, including the Embassy Ball sequence and the final scene of the 1938 film rather than the ending for Shaw&#x27;s original play. The montage showing Eliza&#x27;s lessons was also expanded, combining both Lerner&#x27;s and Shaw&#x27;s dialogue. The artwork on the original Broadway poster (and the sleeve of the cast recording) is by Al Hirschfeld, who drew the playwright Shaw as a heavenly puppetmaster pulling the strings on the Henry Higgins character, while Higgins in turn attempts to control Eliza Doolittle.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway production===

The musical had its pre-Broadway tryout at New Haven&#x27;s Shubert Theatre. At the first preview Rex Harrison, who was unaccustomed to singing in front of a live orchestra, &quot;announced that under no circumstances would he go on that night...with those thirty-two interlopers in the pit&quot;. He locked himself in his dressing room and came out little more than an hour before curtain time. The whole company had been dismissed but were recalled, and opening night was a success. &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; then played for four weeks at the Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia, beginning on February 15, 1956.

The musical premiered on Broadway March 15, 1956, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre in New York City. It transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre and then The Broadway Theatre, where it closed on September 29, 1962, after 2,717 performances, a record at the time. Moss Hart directed and Hanya Holm was choreographer. In addition to stars Rex Harrison, Julie Andrews and Stanley Holloway, the original cast included Robert Coote, Cathleen Nesbitt, John Michael King, and Reid Shelton. Harrison was replaced by Edward Mulhare in November 1957 and Sally Ann Howes replaced Andrews in February 1958. By the start of 1959, it was the biggest grossing Broadway show of all-time with a gross of $10 million.

The &quot;Original Cast Recording&quot;, released on April 2, 1956, was the best-selling album in the United States in 1956.

===Original London production===
The West End production, in which Harrison, Andrews, Coote, and Holloway reprised their roles, opened on April 30, 1958, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where it ran for five and a half years (2,281 performances). Edwardian musical comedy star Zena Dare made her last appearance in the musical as Mrs. Higgins. Leonard Weir played Freddy. Harrison left the London cast in March 1959, followed by Andrews in August 1959 and Holloway in October 1959.

===1970s revivals===
The first Broadway revival opened at the St. James Theatre 20 years after the original, on March 25, 1976, and ran there until December 5, 1976; it then transferred to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, running from December 9, 1976, until it closed on February 20, 1977, after a total of 377 performances and 7 previews. The director was Jerry Adler, with choreography by Crandall Diehl, based on the original choreography by Hanya Holm. Ian Richardson starred as Higgins, with Christine Andreas as Eliza, George Rose as Alfred P. Doolittle and Robert Coote recreating his role as Colonel Pickering. Both Richardson and Rose were nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, with the award going to Rose.

A Cameron MacKintosh revival opened at London&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre in October 1979, following a national tour. Originated at the Haymarket Theatre Leicester, the production was created under a new agreement with The Arts Council to tour West End standard productions. It featured Tony Britton as Higgins, Liz Robertson as Eliza, Dame Anna Neagle as Higgins&#x27;s mother, Peter Bayliss as Doolittle, Richard Caldicot as Pickering and Peter Land as Freddy. It was directed by Robin Midgley, with sets by Adrian Vaux, costumes by Tim Goodchild and choreography by Gillian Lynne. Britton and Robertson were both nominated for Olivier Awards.

===1981 and 1993 Broadway revivals===
The second Broadway revival of the original production opened at the Uris Theatre on August 18, 1981, and closed on November 29, 1981, after 119 performances and 5 previews. Rex Harrison recreated his role as Higgins, with Jack Gwillim as Pickering, Milo O&#x27;Shea as Doolittle, and Cathleen Nesbitt, at 93 years old reprising her role as Mrs. Higgins. The revival co-starred Nancy Ringham as Eliza. The director was Patrick Garland, with choreography by Crandall Diehl, recreating the original Hanya Holm dances.

A new revival directed by Howard Davies opened at the Virginia Theatre on December 9, 1993, and closed on May 1, 1994, after 165 performances and 16 previews. The cast starred Richard Chamberlain as Higgins, Melissa Errico as Eliza and Paxton Whitehead as Pickering. Julian Holloway, son of Stanley Holloway, recreated his father&#x27;s role of Alfred P. Doolittle. Donald Saddler was the choreographer.

===2001 London revival; 2003 Hollywood Bowl production===
Cameron Mackintosh produced a new production on March 15, 2001, at the Royal National Theatre, which transferred to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on July 21. Directed by Trevor Nunn, with choreography by Matthew Bourne, the musical starred Martine McCutcheon as Eliza and Jonathan Pryce as Higgins, with Dennis Waterman as Alfred P. Doolittle. This revival won three Olivier Awards: Outstanding Musical Production, Best Actress in a Musical (Martine McCutcheon) and Best Theatre Choreographer (Matthew Bourne), with Anthony Ward receiving a nomination for Set Design.

===Other major productions===
====Berlin, 1961====

A German translation of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; opened on October 1, 1961, at the Theater des Westens in Berlin, starring Karin Hübner and Paul Hubschmid (and conducted, as was the Broadway opening, by Franz Allers). Coming at the height of Cold War tensions, just weeks after the closing of the East Berlin–West Berlin border and the erection of the Berlin Wall, this was the first staging of a Broadway musical in Berlin since World War II. As such it was seen as a symbol of West Berlin&#x27;s cultural renaissance and resistance. Lost attendance from East Berlin (now no longer possible) was partly made up by a &quot;musical air bridge&quot; of flights bringing in patrons from West Germany, and the production was embraced by Berliners, running for two years.

====2007 New York Philharmonic concert and US tour====
In 2007 the New York Philharmonic held a full-costume concert presentation of the musical. The concert had a four-day engagement lasting from March 7–10 at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Avery Fisher Hall. It starred Kelsey Grammer as Higgins, Kelli O&#x27;Hara as Eliza, Charles Kimbrough as Pickering, and Brian Dennehy as Alfred Doolittle. Marni Nixon played Mrs. Higgins; Nixon had provided the singing voice of Audrey Hepburn in the film version.

A U.S. tour of Mackintosh&#x27;s 2001 West End production ran from September 12, 2007, to June 22, 2008. The production starred Christopher Cazenove as Higgins, Lisa O&#x27;Hare as Eliza, Walter Charles as Pickering, Tim Jerome as Alfred Doolittle and Nixon as Mrs. Higgins, replacing Sally Ann Howes.

====2008 Australian tour====
An Australian tour produced by Opera Australia commenced in May 2008. The production starred Reg Livermore as Higgins, Taryn Fiebig as Eliza, Robert Grubb as Alfred Doolittle and Judi Connelli as Mrs Pearce. John Wood took the role of Alfred Doolittle in Queensland, and Richard E. Grant played the role of Henry Higgins at the Theatre Royal, Sydney.

====2010 Paris revival====
A new production was staged by Robert Carsen at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris for a limited 27-performance run, opening December 9, 2010, and closing January 2, 2011. It was presented in English. The costumes were designed by Anthony Powell and the choreography was by Lynne Page. The cast was as follows: Sarah Gabriel / Christine Arand (Eliza Doolittle), Alex Jennings (Henry Higgins), Margaret Tyzack (Mrs. Higgins), Nicholas Le Prevost (Colonel Pickering), Donald Maxwell (Alfred Doolittle), and Jenny Galloway (Mrs. Pearce).

====2012 Sheffield production====
A new production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; opened at Sheffield Crucible on December 13, 2012. Dominic West played Henry Higgins, and Carly Bawden played Eliza Doolittle. Sheffield Theatres&#x27; Artistic Director Daniel Evans was the director. The production ran until January 26, 2013.

====2016 Australian production====
The Gordon Frost Organisation, together with Opera Australia, presented a production at the Sydney Opera House from August 30 to November 5, 2016. It was directed by Julie Andrews and featured the set and costume designs of the original 1956 production by Smith and Beaton. The production sold more tickets than any other in the history of the Sydney Opera House. The show&#x27;s opening run in Sydney was so successful that in November 2016, ticket pre-sales were released for a re-run in Sydney, with the extra shows scheduled between August 24 and September 10, 2017, at the Capitol Theatre. In 2017, the show toured to Brisbane from March 12 and Melbourne from May 11.

The cast featured Alex Jennings as Higgins (Charles Edwards for Brisbane and Melbourne seasons), Anna O&#x27;Byrne as Eliza, Reg Livermore as Alfred P. Doolittle, Robyn Nevin as Mrs. Higgins (later Pamela Rabe), Mark Vincent as Freddy, Tony Llewellyn-Jones as Colonel Pickering, Deidre Rubenstein as Mrs. Pearce, and David Whitney as Karpathy.

==Critical reception==
According to Geoffrey Block, &quot;Opening night critics immediately recognized that &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; fully measured up to the Rodgers and Hammerstein model of an integrated musical ... Robert Coleman ... wrote &#x27;The Lerner-Loewe songs are not only delightful, they advance the action as well. They are ever so much more than interpolations, or interruptions.&#x27;&quot; The musical opened to &quot;unanimously glowing reviews, one of which said &#x27;Don&#x27;t bother reading this review now. You&#x27;d better sit right down and send for those tickets ...&#x27; Critics praised the thoughtful use of Shaw&#x27;s original play, the brilliance of the lyrics, and Loewe&#x27;s well-integrated score.&quot;

A sampling of praise from critics, excerpted from a book form of the musical, published in 1956.
* &quot;&quot;My Fair Lady&quot; is wise, witty, and winning. In short, a miraculous musical.&quot; Walter Kerr, &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.
* &quot;A felicitous blend of intellect, wit, rhythm and high spirits. A masterpiece of musical comedy ... a terrific show.&quot; Robert Coleman, &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;.
* &quot;Fine, handsome, melodious, witty and beautifully acted ... an exceptional show.&quot; George Jean Nathan, &quot;New York Journal American&quot;.
* &quot;Everything about &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; is distinctive and distinguished.&quot; John Chapman, &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.
* &quot;Wonderfully entertaining and extraordinarily welcomed ... meritorious in every department.&quot; Wolcott Gibbs, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.
* &quot;One of the &#x27;loverliest&#x27; shows imaginable ... a work of theatre magic.&quot; John Beaufort, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;.
* &quot;An irresistible hit.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;.
* &quot;One of the best musicals of the century.&quot; Brooks Atkinson, &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The reception from Shavians was more mixed, however. Eric Bentley, for instance, called it &quot;a terrible treatment of Mr. Shaw&#x27;s play, [undermining] the basic idea [of the play]&quot;, even though he acknowledged it as &quot;a delightful show&quot;. &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; was later called &quot;the perfect musical&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===1964 film===
George Cukor directed the 1964 film adaptation, with Harrison returning in the role of Higgins. The casting of Audrey Hepburn as Eliza created controversy among theatregoers, both because Andrews was regarded as perfect in the part and because Hepburn&#x27;s singing voice was dubbed (by Marni Nixon). Jack L. Warner, the head of Warner Bros., wanted &quot;a star with a great deal of name recognition&quot;, but since Andrews did not have any film experience, he deemed success more likely with an established movie star. (Andrews went on to star in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; that same year for which she won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actress.) Lerner in particular disliked the film version of the musical, thinking it did not live up to the standards of Moss Hart&#x27;s original direction. He was also unhappy with the casting of Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle and that the film was shot in its entirety at the Warner Bros. studio rather than, as he would have preferred, in London. Despite the controversy, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; was considered a major critical and box-office success, and won eight Oscars, including Best Picture of the Year, Best Actor for Rex Harrison, and Best Director for George Cukor.

===Cancelled 2008 film ===
Columbia Pictures planned a new adaptation in 2008. By 2011, John Madden had been signed to direct the film, and Emma Thompson had written a new screenplay, but the studio had shelved it by 2014.

<text>Martial arts films are a subgenre of action films that feature martial arts combat between characters. These combats are usually the films&#x27; primary appeal and entertainment value, and often are a method of storytelling and character expression and development. Martial arts are frequently featured in training scenes and other sequences in addition to fights. Martial arts films commonly include hand-to-hand combat along with other types of action, such as stuntwork, chases, and gunfights. Sub-genres of martial arts films include kung fu films, wuxia, karate films, and martial arts action comedy films, while related genres include gun fu, jidaigeki and samurai films.

Notable actors who have contributed to the genre include Tony Jaa, Bruce Lee, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, Toshiro Mifune, Donnie Yen, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Gordon Liu, Robin Shou, and Wesley Snipes, among others. Women have also played key roles in the genre, including such actresses as Cheng Pei-pei, Michelle Yeoh, Angela Mao, Zhang Ziyi, Josephine Siao, Cynthia Rothrock, and Kuo Hsiao-Chuang.

==History==

The first ever martial arts film was a Chinese film released in 1928, &quot;The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple&quot; (also translated as &quot;The Burning of the Red Lotus Monastery&quot;), a silent film directed by Chinese film director Zhang Shichuan and produced by the Mingxing Film Company. The film pioneered the martial arts film genre, and was the first kung fu action film ever created. The film is based on the popular Chinese novel &quot;The Romance of the Red Lotus Temple&quot;, which is set in the Qing Dynasty and tells the story of a group of martial artists who band together to defend their temple from raiders. The film is notable for its action sequences and fight scenes, which were groundbreaking for the time and helped establish the martial arts film genre.

Beginning in 1950 with Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot;, starring Toshiro Mifune, Japanese cinema produced a number of samurai films. These films influenced the subsequent Hong Kong kung fu films of Bruce Lee.

Asian films are known to have a more minimalist approach to film based on their culture. Some martial arts films have only a minimal plot and amount of character development and focus almost exclusively on the action, while others have more creative and complex plots and characters along with action scenes. Films of the latter type are generally considered to be artistically superior films, but many films of the former type are commercially successful and well received by fans of the genre. One of the earliest Hollywood movies to employ the use of martial arts was the 1955 film &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;, though the scenes of Spencer Tracy performed barely any realistic fight sequences, but composed mostly of soft knifehand strikes.

Martial arts films contain many characters who are martial artists and these roles are often played by actors who are real martial artists. If not, actors frequently train in preparation for their roles or the action director may rely more on stylized action or film making tricks like camera angles, editing, doubles, undercranking, wire work and computer-generated imagery. Trampolines and springboards used to be used to increase the height of jumps. The minimalist style employs smaller sets and little space for improvised but explosive fight scenes, as seen by Jackie Chan&#x27;s films. These techniques are sometimes used by real martial artists as well, depending on the style of action in the film.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in the 1960s Jimmy Wang Yu was &quot;the biggest star of Asian martial arts cinema until the emergence of Bruce Lee.&quot;

During the 1970s and 1980s, the most visible presence of martial arts films was the hundreds of English-dubbed kung fu and ninja films produced by the Shaw Brothers, Godfrey Ho and other Hong Kong producers. These films were widely broadcast on North American television on weekend timeslots that were often colloquially known as &quot;Kung Fu Theater&quot;, &quot;Black Belt Theater&quot; or variations thereof. Inclusive in this list of films are commercial classics like &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (1971), &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (1978) and &quot;One Armed Boxer&quot; (1972). Those films had a large impact on the spread of practice of Traditional Chinese and Japanese Martial Arts in English-speaking countries.

Martial arts films have been produced all over the world, but the genre has been dominated by Hong Kong action cinema, peaking from 1971 with the rise of Bruce Lee until the mid-1990s with a general decline in the industry, until it was revived close to the 2000s.
Other notable figures in the genre include Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, Donnie Yen, and Hwang Jang-lee.

Sonny Chiba, Etsuko Shihomi, and Hiroyuki Sanada starred in numerous karate and jidaigeki films from Japan during the 1970s and early 1980s. Hollywood has also participated in the genre with actors such as Chuck Norris, Sho Kosugi, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Brandon Lee (son of Bruce Lee), Wesley Snipes, Gary Daniels, Mark Dacascos, and Jason Statham. 

According to the American Film Institute, the success of &quot;Bloodsport&quot; (1988), starring Van Damme, helped the resurgence of the martial arts film genre in the United States. According to Van Damme, the film &quot;helped give the martial arts genre a boost but also foretold certain things like the Ultimate Fighting Championship and the idea of pitting different styles against each other.&quot;

In the 2000s, Thailand&#x27;s film industry became an international force in the genre with the films of Tony Jaa and the cinema of Vietnam followed suit with &quot;The Rebel&quot; (2007) and &quot;Clash&quot; (2009). In more recent years, the Indonesian film industry has offered &quot;Merantau&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Raid: Redemption&quot; (2011).

The Middle East has also participated in the genre with actors such as Youssef Mansour who became famous in the 1990s for his Egyptian films that relied on martial arts.

Women have also played key roles in the genre, including such actresses as Cheng Pei-pei, Michelle Yeoh, Angela Mao, Zhang Ziyi, Josephine Siao, Cynthia Rothrock, and Kuo Hsiao-Chuang. In addition, western animation has ventured into the genre with the most successful effort being the internationally hailed DreamWorks Animation film franchise, &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, starring Jack Black and Angelina Jolie.

&quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999), whose fight scenes were choreographed by Hong Kong fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping, is considered revolutionary in American cinema for raising the standard of fight scenes in Western cinema.

==Subgenres==
In the Chinese-speaking world, martial arts films are commonly divided into two subcategories: the &quot;wuxia&quot; period films (武俠片), and the more modern kung fu films (功夫片, best epitomized in the films of Bruce Lee). However, according to Hong Kong film director, producer, and movie writer Ronny Yu, wuxia movies are not to be confused with martial arts movies.

Kung fu films are a significant movie genre in themselves. Like westerns for Americans, they have become an identity of Chinese cinema. As the most prestigious movie type in Chinese film history, kung fu movies were among the first Chinese films produced and the &quot;wuxia&quot; period films (武俠片) are the original form of Chinese kung fu films. The wuxia period films came into vogue due to the thousands of years popularity of wuxia novels (武俠小說). For example, the wuxia novels of Jin Yong and Gu Long directly led to the prevalence of wuxia period films. Outside of the Chinese speaking world the most famous wuxia film made was the Ang Lee film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000), which was based on the Wang Dulu series of wuxia novels: it earned four Academy Awards, including one for Best Foreign Film.

Martial arts westerns are usually American films inexpensively filmed in Southwestern United States locations, transposing martial arts themes into an &quot;old west&quot; setting; e.g., &quot;Red Sun&quot; with Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune.

<doc id="19029" wikidata="Q842256" url="?curid=19029" title="Musical film">
<text>Musical film is a film genre in which songs by the characters are interwoven into the narrative, sometimes accompanied by dancing. The songs usually advance the plot or develop the film&#x27;s characters, but in some cases, they serve merely as breaks in the storyline, often as elaborate &quot;production numbers&quot;.

The musical film was a natural development of the stage musical after the emergence of sound film technology. Typically, the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery and locations that would be impractical in a theater. Musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if a live audience were watching. In a sense, the viewer becomes the diegetic audience, as the performer looks directly into the camera and performs to it.

With the advent of sound in the late 1920s, musicals gained popularity with the public and are exemplified by the films of Busby Berkeley, a choreographer known for his distinctive and elaborate set pieces featuring multiple showgirls. These lavish production numbers are typified by his choreographic work in &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; (all from 1933). During the 1930s, the musical films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers became massive cultural fixtures in the eyes of the American public. These films included, &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot;, &quot;Swing Time&quot; (both 1936), and &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937). Victor Fleming&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) would become a landmark film for movie musical as it experimented with new technology such as Technicolor.

During the 1940s and 1950s, musical films from MGM musicals regularly premiered. These works included: &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), &quot;High Society&quot; (1956), and &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958). During this time, films outside the Arthur Freed unit at MGM included &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942), &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), and &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957) as well as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), &quot;The King and I&quot; (1956), &quot;Carousel&quot;, and &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1958). These films of the era typically relied on the star power of such film stars as Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Ann Miller, Kathryn Grayson, and Howard Keel. They also relied on film directors such as Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli as well as songwriters Comden and Green, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and the Gershwin Brothers.

During the 1960s, films based on stage musicals continued to be critical and box-office successes. These films included, &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962), &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962), &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (1963), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (both 1964), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (all 1967), &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (both 1968). In the 1970s, film culture and the changing demographics of filmgoers placed greater emphasis on gritty realism, while the pure entertainment and theatricality of classical-era Hollywood musicals was seen as old-fashioned. Despite this, &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1970), &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971), &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972), &quot;1776&quot; (1972), Disney&#x27;s &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971), and &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977), as well as &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;The Wiz&quot; (both 1978), were more traditional musicals closely adapted from stage shows and were strong successes with critics and audiences. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, musicals tended to be mainly coming from the Disney animated films of the period, from composers and lyricists, Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, and Stephen Schwartz. The Disney Renaissance started with 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, then followed by &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996), &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997), and &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998).

In the 21st century, the musical genre has been rejuvenated with darker musicals, musical biopics, musical remakes, epic drama musicals and comedy drama musicals such as &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001), &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (2004), &quot;Rent&quot; (2005), &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006), &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, &quot;Enchanted&quot;, &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (all 2007), &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008), &quot;Nine&quot; (2009), &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011), &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (2012), &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014), &quot;La La Land&quot; (2016), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot; (both 2017), &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again!&quot;, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (all 2018), &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Rocketman&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot; (all 2019), &quot;The Prom&quot; (2020), &quot;In the Heights&quot;, &quot;Respect&quot;, &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot;, &quot;Cyrano&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking About Jamie, Tick, Tick… Boom!, West Side Story&quot; (all 2021), &quot;Elvis&quot;, &quot;Spirited&quot;, &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot; (all 2022), &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Wonka&quot;, &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (all 2023), &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, &quot;Wicked&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot; (all 2024), &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon&quot; (all 2025).

==Hollywood musical films==
===1930–1950: The first classical sound era or First Musical Era===
The 1930s through the early 1950s are considered to be the golden age of the musical film, when the genre&#x27;s popularity was at its highest in the Western world. Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, the earliest Disney animated feature film, was a musical which won an honorary Oscar for Walt Disney at the 11th Academy Awards.

====The first musicals====
Musical short films were made by Lee de Forest in 1923–24. Beginning in 1926, thousands of Vitaphone shorts were made, many featuring bands, vocalists, and dancers. The earliest feature-length films with synchronized sound had only a soundtrack of music and occasional sound effects that played while the actors portrayed their characters just as they did in silent films: without audible dialogue. &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, released in 1927 by Warner Brothers, was the first to include an audio track including non-diegetic music and diegetic music, but it had only a short sequence of spoken dialogue. This feature-length film was also a musical, featuring Al Jolson singing &quot;Dirty Hands, Dirty Face&quot;, &quot;Toot, Toot, Tootsie&quot;, &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, and &quot;My Mammy&quot;. Historian Scott Eyman wrote, &quot;As the film ended and applause grew with the houselights, Sam Goldwyn&#x27;s wife Frances looked around at the celebrities in the crowd. She saw &#x27;terror in all their faces&#x27;, she said, as if they knew that &#x27;the game they had been playing for years was finally over&#x27;.&quot; Still, only isolated sequences featured &quot;live&quot; sound; most of the film had only a synchronous musical score. In 1928, Warner Brothers followed this up with another Jolson part-talkie, &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;, which was a blockbuster hit. Theaters scrambled to install the new sound equipment and to hire Broadway composers to write musicals for the screen. The first all-talking feature, &quot;Lights of New York&quot;, included a musical sequence in a night club. The enthusiasm of audiences was so great that in less than a year all the major studios were making sound pictures exclusively. &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; (1929) had a show-biz plot about two sisters competing for a charming song-and-dance man. Advertised by MGM as the first &quot;All-Talking, All-Singing, All-Dancing&quot; feature film, it was a hit and won the Academy Award for Best Picture for 1929. There was a rush by the studios to hire talent from the stage to star in lavishly filmed versions of Broadway hits. &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (Paramount 1929) starred Maurice Chevalier and newcomer Jeanette MacDonald, written by Broadway veteran Guy Bolton.

Warner Brothers produced the first screen operetta, &quot;The Desert Song&quot; in 1929. They spared no expense and photographed a large percentage of the film in Technicolor. This was followed by the first all-color, all-talking musical feature which was entitled &quot;On with the Show&quot; (1929). The most popular film of 1929 was the second all-color, all-talking feature which was entitled &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot; (1929). This film broke all box office records and remained the highest-grossing film ever produced until 1939. Suddenly, the market became flooded with musicals, revues, and operettas. The following all-color musicals were produced in 1929 and 1930 alone: &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot; (1929), &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (1929), &quot;Sally&quot; (1929), &quot;The Vagabond King&quot; (1930), &quot;Follow Thru&quot; (1930), &quot;Bright Lights&quot; (1930), &quot;Golden Dawn&quot; (1930), &quot;Hold Everything&quot; (1930), &quot;The Rogue Song&quot; (1930), &quot;Song of the Flame&quot; (1930), &quot;Song of the West&quot; (1930), &quot;Sweet Kitty Bellairs&quot; (1930), &quot;Under a Texas Moon&quot; (1930), &quot;Bride of the Regiment&quot; (1930), &quot;Whoopee!&quot; (1930), &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930), &quot;Viennese Nights&quot; (1930), and &quot;Kiss Me Again&quot; (1930). In addition, there were scores of musical features released with color sequences.

Hollywood released more than 100 musical films in 1930, but only 14 in 1931. By late 1930, audiences had been oversaturated with musicals and studios were forced to cut the music from films that were then being released. For example, &quot;Life of the Party&quot; (1930) was originally produced as an all-color, all-talking musical comedy. Before it was released, however, the songs were cut out. The same thing happened to &quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot; (1931) and &quot;Manhattan Parade&quot; (1932) both of which had been filmed entirely in Technicolor. Marlene Dietrich sang songs successfully in her films, and Rodgers and Hart wrote a few well-received films, but even their popularity waned by 1932. The public had quickly come to associate color with musicals and thus the decline in their popularity also resulted in a decline in color productions.

====Busby Berkeley====
The taste in musicals revived again in 1933 when director Busby Berkeley began to enhance the traditional dance number with ideas drawn from the drill precision he had experienced as a soldier during World War I. In films such as &quot;42nd Street&quot; and &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; (1933), Berkeley choreographed a number of films in his unique style. Berkeley&#x27;s numbers typically begin on a stage but gradually transcend the limitations of theatrical space: his ingenious routines, involving human bodies forming patterns like a kaleidoscope, could never fit onto a real stage and the intended perspective is viewing from straight above.

====Musical stars====
Musical stars such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were among the most popular and highly respected personalities in Hollywood during the classical era; the Fred and Ginger pairing was particularly successful, resulting in a number of classic films such as &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), and &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937). Many dramatic actors gladly participated in musicals as a way to break away from their typecasting. For instance, the multi-talented James Cagney had originally risen to fame as a stage singer and dancer, but his repeated casting in &quot;tough guy&quot; roles and mob films gave him few chances to display these talents. Cagney&#x27;s Oscar-winning role in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942) allowed him to sing and dance, and he considered it to be one of his finest moments.

Many comedies (and a few dramas) included their own musical numbers. The Marx Brothers&#x27; films included a musical number in nearly every film, allowing the Brothers to highlight their musical talents. Their final film, entitled &quot;Love Happy&quot; (1949), featured Vera-Ellen, considered to be the best dancer among her colleagues and professionals in the half century.

Similarly, the vaudevillian comedian W. C. Fields joined forces with the comic actress Martha Raye and the young comedian Bob Hope in Paramount Pictures musical anthology &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;. The film also showcased the talents of several internationally recognized musical artists including: Kirsten Flagstad (Norwegian operatic soprano), Wilfred Pelletier (Canadian conductor of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra), Tito Guizar (Mexican tenor), Shep Fields conducting his Rippling Rhythm Jazz Orchestra and John Serry Sr. (Italian-American concert accordionist). In addition to the Academy Award for Best Original Song (1938), the film earned an ASCAP Film and Television Award (1989) for Bob Hope&#x27;s signature song &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;.

====The Freed Unit====
During the late 1940s and into the early 1950s, a production unit at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer headed by Arthur Freed made the transition from old-fashioned musical films, whose formula had become repetitive, to something new. (However, they also produced technicolor remakes of such musicals as &quot;Show Boat&quot;, which had previously been filmed in the 1930s.) In 1939, Freed was hired as associate producer for the film &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;. Starting in 1944 with &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, the Freed Unit worked somewhat independently of its own studio to produce some of the most popular and well-known examples of the genre. The products of this unit include &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953) and &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958). Non-Freed musicals from the studio included &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; in 1954 and &quot;High Society&quot; in 1956, and the studio distributed Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; in 1955.

This era saw musical stars become household names, including Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Ann Miller, Donald O&#x27;Connor, Cyd Charisse, Mickey Rooney, Vera-Ellen, Jane Powell, Howard Keel, and Kathryn Grayson. Fred Astaire was also coaxed out of retirement for &quot;Easter Parade&quot; and made a permanent comeback.

====Outside MGM====
The other Hollywood studios proved themselves equally adept at tackling the genre at this time, particularly in the 1950s. Four adaptations of Rodgers and Hammerstein shows - &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, and &quot;South Pacific&quot; - were all successes, while Paramount Pictures released &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Funny Face&quot;, two films which used previously written music by Irving Berlin and the Gershwins, respectively. Warner Bros. produced &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;; the former film was a vehicle for Doris Day, while the latter provided a big-screen comeback for Judy Garland, who had been out of the spotlight since 1950. Meanwhile, director Otto Preminger, better known for &quot;message pictures&quot;, made &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; and &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, both starring Dorothy Dandridge, who is considered the first African American A-list film star. Celebrated director Howard Hawks also ventured into the genre with &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;.
In the 1960s, 1970s, and continuing up to today, the musical film became less of a bankable genre that could be relied upon for sure-fire hits. Audiences for them lessened and fewer musical films were produced as the genre became less mainstream and more specialized.

===The 1960s musical===
In the 1960s, the critical and box-office success of the films &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;The Music Man&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and &quot;Funny Girl&quot; suggested that the traditional musical was in good health, while French filmmaker Jacques Demy&#x27;s jazz musicals &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; and &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; were popular with international critics. However popular musical tastes were being heavily affected by rock and roll and the freedom and youth associated with it, and indeed Elvis Presley made a few films that have been equated with the old musicals in terms of form. &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;, starring the Beatles, were audacious. Most of the musical films of the 1950s and 1960s such as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; were straightforward adaptations or restagings of successful stage productions. The most successful musicals of the 1960s created specifically for film were &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, two of Disney&#x27;s biggest hits of all time.

The phenomenal box-office performance of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; gave the major Hollywood studios more confidence to produce lengthy, large-budget musicals. Despite the resounding success of some of these films, Hollywood also produced a large number of musical flops in the late 1960s and early 1970s which appeared to seriously misjudge public taste. The commercially and/or critically unsuccessful films included &quot;Camelot&quot;, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot;, &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;, &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Star!&quot;, &quot;Darling Lili&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, &quot;Song of Norway&quot;, &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, &quot;1776&quot;, &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, and &quot;Mame&quot;. Collectively and individually these failures affected the financial viability of several major studios.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, film culture and the changing demographics of filmgoers placed greater emphasis on gritty realism, while the pure entertainment and theatricality of classical-era Hollywood musicals was seen as old-fashioned. Despite this, &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot; were more traditional musicals closely adapted from stage shows and were strong successes with critics and audiences. Changing cultural mores and the abandonment of the Hays Code in 1968 also contributed to changing tastes in film audiences. The 1973 film of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; was met with some criticism by religious groups but was well received. By the mid-1970s, filmmakers avoided the genre in favor of using music by popular rock or pop bands as background music, partly in hope of selling a soundtrack album to fans. &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; was originally released in 1975 and was a critical failure until it started midnight screenings in the 1980s where it achieved cult status. That same year also saw the premiere of the R&amp;B band Bloodstone&#x27;s movie &quot;Train Ride to Hollywood&quot;, but problems in distribution rendered it barely getting token theatrical release. The year 1976 saw the release of the low-budget comic musical, &quot;The First Nudie Musical&quot;, released by Paramount. The 1978 film version of &quot;Grease&quot; was a smash hit; its songs were original compositions done in a 1950s pop style. However, the sequel &quot;Grease 2&quot; (released in 1982) bombed at the box-office. Films about performers which incorporated gritty drama and musical numbers interwoven as a diegetic part of the storyline were produced, such as &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;, &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, and &quot;New York, New York&quot;. Some musicals made in Britain experimented with the form, such as Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (released in 1969), Alan Parker&#x27;s &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; and Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Lisztomania&quot;.

A number of film musicals were still being made that were financially and/or critically less successful than in the musical&#x27;s heyday. They include &quot;1776&quot;, &quot;The Wiz&quot;, &quot;At Long Last Love&quot;, &quot;Mame&quot;, &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;,&quot; Godspell&quot;, &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot;, &quot;Funny Lady&quot; (Barbra Streisand&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Funny Girl&quot;), &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, and &quot;Hair&quot; amongst others. The critical wrath against &quot;At Long Last Love&quot;, in particular, was so strong that it was never released on home video. Fantasy musical films &quot;Scrooge&quot;, &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;, &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;, and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; were also released in the 1970s, the latter winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

===1980s to 1990s===
By the 1980s, financiers grew increasingly confident in the musical genre, partly buoyed by the relative health of the musical on Broadway and London&#x27;s West End. Productions of the 1980s and 1990s included &quot;The Apple&quot;, &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;, &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;, &quot;Footloose&quot;, &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;, &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Newsies&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot;, and &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;. However, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, starring the Village People, was a calamitous attempt to resurrect the old-style musical and was released to audience indifference in 1980. &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; was based on an off-Broadway musical adaptation of a 1960 Roger Corman film, a precursor of later film-to-stage-to-film adaptations, including &quot;The Producers&quot;.

Many animated films of the period – predominately from Disney – included traditional musical numbers. Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, and Stephen Schwartz had previous musical theater experience and wrote songs for animated films during this time, supplanting Disney workhorses the Sherman Brothers. Starting with 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, the Disney Renaissance gave new life to the musical film. Other successful animated musicals included &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; from Disney proper, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; from Disney division Touchstone Pictures, &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; from DreamWorks, &quot;Anastasia&quot; from Fox and Don Bluth, Eight Crazy Nights from Columbia, and &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; from Paramount. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and others were adapted for the stage after their blockbuster success.

=== 2000–now: The second-classical era or New Musical Era ===

==== 21st-century musicals or New Age ====
In the 21st century, movie musicals were reborn with darker musicals, musical biopics, epic drama musicals and comedy drama musicals such as &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;La La Land&quot;, and &quot;West Side Story&quot;; all of which won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy in their respective years, while such films as &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, &quot;Nine&quot;, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, &quot;Rocketman&quot;, &quot;The Prom&quot;, &quot;Cyrano&quot;, &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot;, &quot;Elvis&quot;, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, and &quot;Wicked&quot; were only nominated. &quot;Chicago&quot; was also the first musical since &quot;Oliver!&quot; to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

Joshua Oppenheimer&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated documentary &quot;The Act of Killing&quot; may be considered a nonfiction musical.

One specific musical trend was the rising number of jukebox musicals based on music from various pop/rock artists on the big screen, some of which based on Broadway shows. Examples of Broadway-based jukebox musical films included &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (ABBA), &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, and &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; (The Proclaimers). Original ones included &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (The Beatles), &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (various pop hits), &quot;Idlewild&quot; (Outkast) and &quot;Yesterday&quot; (The Beatles).

Disney also returned to musicals with &quot;Enchanted&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, &quot;Tangled&quot;, &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;The Muppets&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, &quot;Moana&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, &quot;Frozen II&quot;, &quot;Stargirl&quot;, &quot;Encanto&quot;, &quot;Better Nate Than Ever&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Stargirl&quot;, &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, &quot;Wish&quot;, &quot;Moana 2&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Following a string of successes with live action fantasy adaptations of several of their animated features, Disney produced a live action version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, the first of this live action fantasy adaptation pack to be an all-out musical, and features new songs as well as new lyrics to both the Gaston number and the reprise of the title song. Bill Condon, who directed &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, directed &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. The second film of this live action fantasy adaptation pack to be an all-out musical was &quot;Aladdin&quot; and features new songs. The third film of this live action fantasy adaptation pack to be an all-out musical was &quot;The Lion King&quot; and features new songs. The fourth film of this live action fantasy adaptation pack to be an all-out musical was &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and features new songs with lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, replacing Ashman. Pixar also produced &quot;Coco&quot;, the first computer-animated musical film by the company. Other animated musical films include &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;, &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; The Lorax&quot;, &quot;Rio 2&quot;, &quot;The Book of Life&quot;, &quot;Trolls&quot;, &quot;Sing&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Smallfoot&quot;, &quot;UglyDolls&quot;, &quot;Trolls World Tour&quot;, &quot;Over the Moon&quot;, &quot;Vivo&quot;, &quot;Sing 2&quot;, &quot;The Bob&#x27;s Burgers Movie&quot;, &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot;, &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot;, &quot;Leo&quot;, &quot;Thelma the Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, and &quot;Smurfs&quot;.

Biopics about music artists and showmen were also big in the 21st century. Examples include &quot;8 Mile&quot; (Eminem), &quot;Ray&quot; (Ray Charles), &quot;Walk the Line&quot; (Johnny Cash and June Carter), (Édith Piaf), &quot;Notorious&quot; (Biggie Smalls), &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; (The Four Seasons) &quot;Love &amp; Mercy&quot; (Brian Wilson), &quot;&quot; (TLC), &quot;&quot; (Aaliyah), &quot;Get on Up&quot; (James Brown), &quot;Whitney&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody&quot; (Whitney Houston), &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; (N.W.A), &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot; (P. T. Barnum), &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (Freddie Mercury), &quot;The Dirt&quot; (Mötley Crüe), &quot;Judy&quot; (Judy Garland), &quot;Rocketman&quot; (Elton John), &quot;Respect&quot; (Aretha Franklin), &quot;Elvis&quot; (Elvis Presley) and &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot; (Bob Dylan). Grossing over $900 million at the box office &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is the most commercially successful musical biopic.

Director Damien Chazelle created a musical film called &quot;La La Land&quot;, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. It was meant to reintroduce the traditional jazz style of song numbers with influences from the Golden Age of Hollywood and Jacques Demy&#x27;s French musicals while incorporating a contemporary/modern take on the story and characters with balances in fantasy numbers and grounded reality. It received 14 nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, tying the record for most nominations with &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950) and &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), and won the awards for Best Director, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, and Best Production Design.

====Live! television events====
In 2013, NBC produced &quot;The Sound of Music Live!&quot; as part of their effort for expanded live entertainment events, which became an annual tradition of adaptations of stage musicals, created specifically as live television events. The following years featured &quot;Peter Pan Live!&quot;, &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot;, &quot;Hairspray Live!&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar Live!&quot;, &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; The Grinch Musical Live!&quot;, and &quot;Annie Live!&quot;. ABC and Fox also produced similar events, including &quot;Grease Live!&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Story Live!&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Little Mermaid Live!&quot;.

==Indian musical films==

An exception to the decline of the musical film is Indian cinema, especially the Bollywood film industry based in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), where most of films have been, and still are, musicals. The majority of films produced in the Tamil industry, based in Chennai (formerly Madras), the Sandalwood industry, based in Bangalore, the Telugu industry, based in Hyderabad, and the Malayalam industry are also musicals.

Despite this exception of almost every Indian movie being a musical and India producing the most movies in the world (formed in 1913), the first Bollywood film to be a complete musical, &quot;Dev D&quot; (directed by Anurag Kashyap), came in 2009. The second musical film to follow was &quot;Jagga Jasoos&quot; (directed by Anurag Basu), in 2017.

===Early sound films (1930s–1940s)===
Bollywood musicals have their roots in the traditional musical theatre of India, such as classical Indian musical theatre, Sanskrit drama, and Parsi theatre. Early Bombay filmmakers combined these Indian musical theatre traditions with the musical film format that emerged from early Hollywood sound films. Other early influences on Bombay filmmakers included Urdu literature and the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;.

The first Indian sound film, Ardeshir Irani&#x27;s &quot;Alam Ara&quot; (1931), was a major commercial success. There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals; Bollywood and all the regional film industries quickly switched to sound filming.

In 1937, Ardeshir Irani, of &quot;Alam Ara&quot; fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, &quot;Kisan Kanya&quot;. The next year, he made another colour film, a version of &quot;Mother India&quot;. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.

===Golden Age (late 1940s–1960s)===
Following India&#x27;s independence, the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Hindi cinema. Some of the most critically acclaimed Hindi films of all time were produced during this period. Examples include &quot;Pyaasa&quot; (1957) and &quot;Kaagaz Ke Phool&quot; (1959), directed by Guru Dutt and written by Abrar Alvi, &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951) and &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955), directed by Raj Kapoor and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, and &quot;Aan&quot; (1952), directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Dilip Kumar. These films expressed social themes mainly dealing with working-class life in India, particularly urban life in the former two examples; &quot;Awaara&quot; presented the city as both a nightmare and a dream, while &quot;Pyaasa&quot; critiqued the unreality of city life.

Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), a remake of his earlier &quot;Aurat&quot; (1940), was the first Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which it lost by a single vote. &quot;Mother India&quot; was also an important film that defined the conventions of Hindi cinema for decades.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the industry was dominated by musical romance films with &quot;romantic hero&quot; leads, the most popular being Rajesh Khanna. Other actors during this period include Shammi Kapoor, Jeetendra, Sanjeev Kumar, and Shashi Kapoor, and actresses like Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Saira Banu, Helen and Asha Parekh.

===Classic Bollywood (1970s–1980s)===
By the start of the 1970s, Hindi cinema was experiencing thematic stagnation, dominated by musical romance films. The arrival of screenwriter duo Salim–Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, marked a paradigm shift, revitalizing the industry. They began the genre of gritty, violent, Bombay underworld crime films in the early 1970s, with films such as &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973) and &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975).

The 1970s was also when the name &quot;Bollywood&quot; was coined, and when the quintessential conventions of commercial Bollywood films were established. Key to this was the emergence of the masala film genre, which combines elements of multiple genres (action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama, musical). The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker Nasir Hussain, along with screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format. &quot;Yaadon Ki Baarat&quot; (1973), directed by Hussain and written by Salim-Javed, has been identified as the first masala film and the &quot;first&quot; quintessentially &quot;Bollywood&quot; film. Salim-Javed went on to write more successful masala films in the 1970s and 1980s. Masala films launched Amitabh Bachchan into the biggest Bollywood movie star of the 1970s and 1980s. A landmark for the masala film genre was &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977), directed by Manmohan Desai and written by Kader Khan. Manmohan Desai went on to successfully exploit the genre in the 1970s and 1980s.

Along with Bachchan, other popular actors of this era included Feroz Khan, Mithun Chakraborty, Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor and Sunny Deol. Actresses from this era included Hema Malini, Jaya Bachchan, Raakhee, Shabana Azmi, Zeenat Aman, Parveen Babi, Rekha, Dimple Kapadia, Smita Patil, Jaya Prada and Padmini Kolhapure.

===New Bollywood (1990s–present)===
In the late 1980s, Hindi cinema experienced another period of stagnation, with a decline in box office turnout, due to increasing violence, decline in musical melodic quality, and rise in video piracy, leading to middle-class family audiences abandoning theaters. The turning point came with &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot; (1988), directed by Mansoor Khan, written and produced by his father Nasir Hussain, and starring his cousin Aamir Khan with Juhi Chawla. Its blend of youthfulness, wholesome entertainment, emotional quotients and strong melodies lured family audiences back to the big screen. It set a new template for Bollywood musical romance films that defined Hindi cinema in the 1990s.

The period of Hindi cinema from the 1990s onwards is referred to as &quot;New Bollywood&quot; cinema, linked to economic liberalisation in India during the early 1990s. By the early 1990s, the pendulum had swung back toward family-centric romantic musicals. &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot; was followed by blockbusters such as &quot;Maine Pyar Kiya&quot; (1989), &quot;Chandni&quot; (1989), &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Kaun&quot; (1994), &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995), &quot;Raja Hindustani&quot; (1996), &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), &quot;Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha&quot; (1998) and &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998). A new generation of popular actors emerged, such as Aamir Khan, Aditya Pancholi, Ajay Devgan, Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan (Salim Khan&#x27;s son), and Shahrukh Khan, and actresses such as Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi, Juhi Chawla, Meenakshi Seshadri, Manisha Koirala, Kajol, and Karisma Kapoor.

Since the 1990s, the three biggest Bollywood movie stars have been the &quot;Three Khans&quot;: Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Salman Khan. Combined, they have starred in most of the top ten highest-grossing Bollywood films. The three Khans have had successful careers since the late 1980s, and have dominated the Indian box office since the 1990s, across three decades.

===Influence on Western films (2000s–present)===
Baz Luhrmann stated that his successful musical film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001) was directly inspired by Bollywood musicals. The film pays homage to India, incorporating an Indian-themed play and a Bollywood-style dance sequence with a song from the film &quot;China Gate&quot;. The critical and financial success of &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; renewed interest in the then-moribund Western live action musical genre, and subsequently films such as &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;The Producers&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, and &quot;Hairspray&quot; were produced, fueling a renaissance of the genre.

&quot;The Guru&quot; and &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot; also feature Indian-style song-and-dance sequences; the Bollywood musical &quot;Lagaan&quot; (2001) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; two other Bollywood films &quot;Devdas&quot; (2002) and &quot;Rang De Basanti&quot; (2006) were nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language; and Danny Boyle&#x27;s Academy Award winning &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008) also features a Bollywood-style song-and-dance number during the film&#x27;s end credits, &quot;Tallika&quot; (2022) was the first movie with Maximum Genres of Music Composed by Maharaja and registered as a World Record Holder in Music,

==Spanish musical films==
Spain has a history and tradition of musical films that were made independent of Hollywood influence. The first films arise during the Second Spanish Republic of the 1930s and the advent of sound films. A few zarzuelas (Spanish operetta) were even adapted as screenplays during the silent era. The beginnings of the Spanish musical were focused on romantic Spanish archetypes: Andalusian villages and landscapes, gypsies, &quot;bandoleros&quot;, and copla and other popular folk songs included in story development. These films had even more box-office success than Hollywood premieres in Spain. The first Spanish film stars came from the musical genre: Imperio Argentina, Estrellita Castro, Florián Rey (director) and, later, Lola Flores, Sara Montiel and Carmen Sevilla. The Spanish musical started to expand and grow. Juvenile stars appear and top the box-office. Marisol, Joselito, Pili &amp; Mili, and Rocío Dúrcal were the major figures of musical films from the 1960s to 1970s. Due to Spanish transition to democracy and the rise of &quot;Movida culture&quot;, the musical genre fell in production and box-office, only saved by Carlos Saura and his flamenco musical films.

==Soviet musical film under Stalin==
Unlike the musical films of Hollywood and Bollywood, popularly identified with escapism, the Soviet musical was first and foremost a form of propaganda. Vladimir Lenin said that cinema was &quot;the most important of the arts&quot;. His successor, Joseph Stalin, also recognized the power of cinema in efficiently spreading Communist Party doctrine. Films were widely popular in the 1920s, but it was foreign cinema that dominated the Soviet filmgoing market. Films from Germany and the U.S. proved more entertaining than Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s historical dramas. By the 1930s it was clear that if the Soviet cinema was to compete with its Western counterparts, it would have to give audiences what they wanted: the glamour and fantasy they got from Hollywood. The musical film, which emerged at that time, embodied the ideal combination of entertainment and official ideology.

A struggle between laughter for laughter&#x27;s sake and entertainment with a clear ideological message would define the golden age of the Soviet musical of the 1930s and 1940s. Then-head of the film industry Boris Shumyatsky sought to emulate Hollywood&#x27;s conveyor belt method of production, going so far as to suggest the establishment of a Soviet Hollywood.

===&quot;The Jolly Fellows&quot;===
In 1930, the esteemed Soviet film director Sergei Eisenstein went to the United States with fellow director Grigori Aleksandrov to study Hollywood&#x27;s filmmaking process. The American films greatly impacted Aleksandrov, particularly the musicals. He returned in 1932, and in 1934 directed &quot;The Jolly Fellows&quot;, the first Soviet musical. The film was light on plot and focused more on the comedy and musical numbers. Party officials at first met the film with great hostility. Aleksandrov defended his work by arguing the notion of laughter for laughter&#x27;s sake. Finally, when Aleksandrov showed the film to Stalin, the leader decided that musicals were an effective means of spreading propaganda. Messages like the importance of collective labor and rags-to-riches stories would become the plots of most Soviet musicals.

===&quot;Movies for the Millions&quot;===
The success of &quot;The Jolly Fellows&quot; ensured a place in Soviet cinema for the musical format, but immediately Shumyatsky set strict guidelines to make sure the films promoted Communist values. Shumyatsky&#x27;s decree &quot;Movies for the Millions&quot; demanded conventional plots, characters, and montage to successfully portray Socialist Realism (the glorification of industry and the working class) on film.

The first successful blend of a social message and entertainment was Aleksandrov&#x27;s &quot;Circus&quot; (1936). It starred his wife, Lyubov Orlova (an operatic singer who had also appeared in &quot;The Jolly Fellows&quot;) as an American circus performer who has to immigrate to the USSR from the U.S. because she has a mixed-race child, whom she had with a black man. Amidst the backdrop of lavish musical productions, she finally finds love and acceptance in the USSR, providing the message that racial tolerance can only be found in the Soviet Union.

The influence of Busby Berkeley&#x27;s choreography on Aleksandrov&#x27;s directing can be seen in the musical number leading up to the climax. Another, more obvious reference to Hollywood is the Charlie Chaplin impersonator who provides comic relief throughout the film. Four million people in Moscow and Leningrad went to see &quot;Circus&quot; during its first month in theaters.

Another of Aleksandrov&#x27;s more-popular films was &quot;The Bright Path&quot; (1940). This was a reworking of the fairytale &quot;Cinderella,&quot; set in the contemporary Soviet Union. The Cinderella of the story was again Orlova, who by this time was the most popular star in the USSR. It was a fantasy tale, but the moral of the story was that a better life comes from hard work. Whereas in &quot;Circus&quot;, the musical numbers involved dancing and spectacle, the only type of choreography in &quot;Bright Path&quot; is the movement of factory machines. The music was limited to Orlova&#x27;s singing. Here, work provided the spectacle.

===Ivan Pyryev===
The other director of musical films was Ivan Pyryev. Unlike Aleksandrov, the focus of Pyryev&#x27;s films was life on the collective farms. His films, &quot;Tractor Drivers&quot; (1939), &quot;The Swineherd and the Shepherd&quot; (1941), and his most famous, &quot;Cossacks of the Kuban&quot; (1949) all starred his wife, Marina Ladynina. Like in Aleksandrov&#x27;s &quot;Bright Path&quot;, the only choreography was the work the characters were doing on film. Even the songs were about the joys of working.

Rather than having a specific message for any of his films, Pyryev promoted Stalin&#x27;s slogan &quot;life has become better, life has become more joyous.&quot; Sometimes this message was in stark contrast with the reality of the time. During the filming of &quot;Cossacks of the Kuban&quot;, the Soviet Union was going through a postwar famine. In reality, the actors who were singing about a time of prosperity were hungry and malnourished. The films did, however, provide escapism and optimism for the viewing public.

===&quot;Volga-Volga&quot;===

The most popular film of the brief era of Stalinist musicals was Alexandrov&#x27;s 1938 film &quot;Volga-Volga&quot;. The star, again, was Lyubov Orlova and the film featured singing and dancing, having nothing to do with work. It is the most unusual of its type. The plot surrounds a love story between two individuals who want to play music. They are unrepresentative of Soviet values in that their focus is more on their music than their jobs. The gags poke fun at the local authorities and bureaucracy. There is no glorification of industry since it takes place in a small rural village. Work is not glorified either, since the plot revolves around a group of villagers using their vacation time to go on a trip up the Volga and Moscow Canal to perform in Moscow. The film can be seen as a glorification of Moscow canal without any hint that the canal was built by Gulag prisoners.

&quot;Volga-Volga&quot; followed the aesthetic principles of Socialist Realism rather than the ideological tenets. It became Stalin&#x27;s favorite film and he gave it as a gift to President Roosevelt during WWII. It is another example of one of the films that claimed life is better. Released at the height of Stalin&#x27;s purges, it provided escapism and a comforting illusion for the public.

<text>Maltese (, also or ) is a Semitic language derived from late medieval Sicilian Arabic with Romance superstrata. The only official Semitic and Afroasiatic language of the European Union and the only Semitic language to use the Latin alphabet, and the only Afroasiatic language with Somali to use a Latin script, it is spoken by the Maltese people and is the national language of Malta, According to John L. Hayes, it descended from a North African dialect of Colloquial Arabic which was introduced to Malta when Arab and Berber (Aghlabids) invaders captured it in 869/870 CE. It is also said to have descended from Siculo-Arabic, which developed as a Maghrebi Arabic dialect in the Emirate of Sicily between 831 and 1091. As a result of the Norman invasion of Malta and the subsequent re-Christianization of the islands, Maltese evolved independently of Classical Arabic in a gradual process of latinisation. It is therefore exceptional as a variety of historical Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Classical or Modern Standard Arabic. Maltese is thus classified separately from the 30 varieties constituting the modern Arabic macrolanguage. Maltese is also distinguished from Arabic and other Semitic languages since its morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages, namely Italian and Sicilian.

The original Arabic base comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary, especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words, but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian; and English words make up between 6% and 20% of the vocabulary. A 2016 study shows that, in terms of basic everyday language, speakers of Maltese are able to understand less than a third of what is said to them in Tunisian Arabic and Libyan Arabic, which are Maghrebi Arabic dialects related to Siculo-Arabic, whereas speakers of Tunisian Arabic and Libyan Arabic are able to understand about 40% of what is said to them in Maltese. This reported level of asymmetric intelligibility is considerably lower than the mutual intelligibility found between mainstream varieties of Arabic.

Maltese has always been written in the Latin script, the earliest surviving example dating from the late Middle Ages. It is the only standardised Semitic language written exclusively in the Latin script.

==History==
The origins of the Maltese language are attributed to the arrival, early in the 11th century, of settlers from neighbouring Sicily, where Siculo-Arabic was spoken, reversing the Fatimid Caliphate&#x27;s conquest of the island at the end of the 9th century. This claim has been corroborated by genetic studies, which show that contemporary Maltese people share common ancestry with Sicilians and Calabrians, with little genetic input from North Africa and the Levant.

The Norman conquest in 1091, followed by the expulsion of the Muslims, complete by 1249, permanently isolated the vernacular from its Arabic source, creating the conditions for its evolution into a distinct language. In contrast to Sicily, where Siculo-Arabic became extinct and was replaced by Sicilian, the vernacular in Malta continued to develop alongside Italian, eventually replacing it as official language in 1934, alongside English. The first written reference to the Maltese language is in a will of 1436, where it is called . The oldest known document in Maltese, () by Pietru Caxaro, dates from the 15th century.

The earliest known Maltese dictionary was a 16th-century manuscript entitled &quot;Maltese-Italiano&quot;; it was included in the of Mifsud in 1764, but is now lost. A list of Maltese words was included in both the (1603) and (1606) of Hieronymus Megiser, who had visited Malta in 1588–1589; Domenico Magri gave the etymologies of some Maltese words in his (1677).

An early manuscript dictionary, , was discovered in the in Rome in the 1980s, together with a grammar, the , attributed to a French knight named Thezan. The first systematic lexicon is that of Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis, who also wrote the first systematic grammar of the language and proposed a standard orthography.

==Demographics==

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; reports a total of Maltese speakers: in Malta and in the diaspora. Most speakers also use English, usually the local dialect known as Maltese English.

The largest diaspora community of Maltese speakers is in Australia, with 36,000 speakers reported in 2006 (down from 45,000 in 1996, and expected to decline further).

The Maltese linguistic community in Tunisia originated in the 18th century. Numbering several thousand in the 19th century, it was reported to be only 100 to 200 people as of 2017.

==Classification==
Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic, a Semitic language within the Afroasiatic family. In the course of its history, Maltese has been influenced by Sicilian, Italian, to a lesser extent by Norman, and, more recently, English. Today, the core vocabulary (including both the most commonly used vocabulary and function words) is Semitic, with a large number of loanwords. Due to the Sicilian influence on Siculo-Arabic, Maltese has many language contact features and is most commonly described as a language with a large number of loanwords.

Maltese has historically been classified in various ways, with some claiming that it was derived from ancient Punic (another Semitic language) instead of Siculo-Arabic, and others claiming it is one of the Berber languages (another language family within Afroasiatic). Less plausibly, Fascist Italy classified it as regional Italian.

==Dialects==
Urban varieties of Maltese are closer to Standard Maltese than rural varieties, which have some characteristics that distinguish them from Standard Maltese.
They tend to show some archaic features such as the realisation of and and the imāla of Arabic ā into ē (or ī especially in Gozo), considered archaic because they are reminiscent of 15th-century transcriptions of this sound. Another archaic feature is the realisation of Standard Maltese ā as ō in rural dialects.
There is also a tendency to diphthongise simple vowels, e.g., ū becomes eo or eu.
Rural dialects also tend to employ more Semitic roots and broken plurals than Standard Maltese. In general, rural Maltese is less distant from its Siculo-Arabic ancestor than is Standard Maltese.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

Voiceless stops are only lightly aspirated and voiced stops are fully voiced. Voicing is carried over from the last segment in obstruent clusters; thus, two- and three-obstruent clusters are either voiceless or voiced throughout, e.g. is realised &quot;we write&quot; (similar assimilation phenomena occur in languages like French or Czech). Maltese has final-obstruent devoicing of voiced obstruents and word-final voiceless stops have no audible release, making voiceless–voiced pairs phonetically indistinguishable in word-final position.

Gemination is distinctive word-medially and word-finally in Maltese. The distinction is most rigid intervocalically after a stressed vowel. Stressed, word-final closed syllables with short vowels end in a long consonant, and those with a long vowel in a single consonant; the only exception is where historic and meant the compensatory lengthening of the succeeding vowel. Some speakers have lost length distinction in clusters.

The two nasals and assimilate for place of articulation in clusters. and are usually dental, whereas are all alveolar. are found mostly in words of Italian origin, retaining length (if not word-initial). and are only found in loanwords, e.g. &quot;newspaper&quot; and &quot;television&quot;. The pharyngeal fricative is velar (), uvular (), or glottal () for some speakers.

===Vowels===

Maltese has five short vowels, , written &quot;a e i o u;&quot; six long vowels, , written &quot;a, e, ie, i, o, u,&quot; all of which (with the exception of &quot;ie&quot; ) can be known to represent long vowels in writing only if they are followed by an orthographic &quot;għ&quot; or &quot;h&quot; (otherwise, one needs to know the pronunciation; e.g. &quot;nar&quot; (fire) is pronounced ); and seven diphthongs, , written &quot;aj&quot; or &quot;għi, aw&quot; or &quot;għu, ej&quot; or &quot;għi, ew, iw, oj,&quot; and &quot;ow&quot; or &quot;għu.&quot;

===Historical phonology===
The Maltese consonant system has undergone several changes when compared to Classical Arabic:

While many of these changes (chiefly the merger of emphatic consonants with their non-pharyngealized counterparts) are the result of European influence, others (such as the merger of into ) are found in other varieties of Arabic, and may be either independent developments or features of the Sicilian Arabic dialect which Maltese descends from.

==Orthography==

===Alphabet===
The modern system of Maltese orthography was introduced in 1924.
Below is the Maltese alphabet, with symbols and approximate English pronunciation:

Final vowels with grave accents (à, è, ì, ò, ù) are also found in some Maltese words of Italian origin, such as , (old Italian: ), or (Italian: ).

The official rules governing the structure of the Maltese language are recorded in the official guidebook (English: &quot;Knowledge on Writing in Maltese&quot;) issued by the (Academy of the Maltese language). The first edition of this book was printed in 1924 by the Maltese government&#x27;s printing press. The rules were further expanded in the 1984 book, , which focused mainly on the increasing influence of Romance and English words. In 1992 the academy issued the , which updated the previous works.

The National Council for the Maltese Language (KNM) is the main regulator of the Maltese language (see Maltese Language Act, below). However, the academy&#x27;s orthography rules are still valid and official.

===Written Maltese===
Since Maltese evolved after the Italo-Normans ended Arab rule of the islands, a written form of the language was not developed for a long time after the Arabs&#x27; expulsion in the middle of the thirteenth century. Under the rule of the Knights Hospitaller, both French and Italian were used for official documents and correspondence. During the British colonial period, the use of English was encouraged through education, with Italian being regarded as the next-most important language.

In the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century, philologists and academics such as Mikiel Anton Vassalli made a concerted effort to standardise written Maltese. Many examples of written Maltese exist from before this period, always in the Latin alphabet, &quot;Il-Kantilena&quot; from the 15th century being the earliest example of written Maltese. In 1934, Maltese was recognised as an official language.

===Samples===
Maltese has both Semitic vocabulary and words derived from Romance languages, primarily Italian. Words such as (Arabic origin) and (Italian origin) have the same meaning (&quot;answer&quot;) but are both used in Maltese, rather like &quot;answer&quot; and &quot;response&quot; in English. Below are two versions of the same translations, one with vocabulary mostly derived from Semitic root words and the other using Romance loanwords (from the &quot;Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe &quot;, see p. 17 ):
Below is the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Maltese compared to other Semitic languages (Arabic and Syriac) with cognates highlighted:
==Vocabulary==
Although the original vocabulary of Maltese was Siculo-Arabic, it has incorporated a large number of borrowings from Romance sources (Sicilian, Italian, and French) and, more recently, Germanic ones (from English).

The historical source of modern Maltese vocabulary is 52% Italian/Sicilian, 32% Arabic/Siculo-Arabic, and 6% English, with some of the remainder being French. Today, most function words are Arabic, so despite only making up about a third of the vocabulary, they are the most used when speaking the language. In this way, Maltese is similar to English, a Germanic language that has been strongly influenced by Norman French and Latin (58% of English vocabulary). As a result of this, Romance language-speakers (and to a lesser extent English speakers) can often easily understand more technical ideas expressed in Maltese, such as (&#x27;Geographically, Europe is part of the supercontinent of Eurasia&#x27;), while not understanding a single word of a basic sentence such as (&#x27;The man is in the house&#x27;), which would be easily understood by any Arabic speaker.

===Arabic===
At that time Malta was thoroughly Arabized. The conquerors brought to the island the vulgar (colloquial) variant of Arabic, not the classical one (Classical Arabic); therefore, the Maltese language differs from Classical Arabic in the same way as the Arabic dialects differ from Classical Arabic. The Maltese language also comprises a considerable number of Maghrebi features, but in other ways, it can be closer to other Arabic dialects, or closer to Classical Arabic than to the other dialects as in the word (&#x27;to see&#x27;). Arabic supplies between 32% and 40% of the language&#x27;s vocabulary.

 found that 40% of a sample of 1,821 Quranic Arabic roots were found in Maltese, considerably lower than that found in the Moroccan (58%) and Lebanese (72%) varieties of Arabic. An analysis of the etymology of the 41,000 words in Aquilina&#x27;s &quot;Maltese–English Dictionary&quot; shows that 32% of the Maltese vocabulary is of Arabic origin, although another source claims 40%. Usually, words expressing basic concepts and ideas, such as (man), (woman), (boy), (house), (sun), and (summer), are of Arabic origin. Moreover, in Maltese aim to maximise their use of vocabulary belonging to this group.

Notes: * from Arabic () &quot;to investigate&quot;, ** from Arabic () &quot;to yearn for &quot;.

The following table compares additional cognates in Maltese and some other varieties of Arabic (all forms are written phonetically, as in the source):
Siculo-Arabic dialect which was spoken in Sicily and Malta is the ancestor of the Maltese language, some Siculo-Arabic words are still used in modern Sicilian (a Romance language spoken in Sicily):

The Maltese language has merged many of the original Arabic consonants (in particular the emphatic consonants) with others common to European languages. Thus, original Arabic , , and all merged into Maltese . The vowels, meanwhile, separated from the three in Classical Arabic () into five, as is more typical of many European languages (). Some unstressed short vowels have been elided. The common Arabic greeting is cognate with in Maltese (lit. &quot;the peace for you&quot;, peace be with you), as are similar greetings in other Semitic languages (e.g. in Hebrew).

=== Romance (Sicilian and Italian) ===
An analysis of the etymology of the 41,000 words in Aquilina&#x27;s &quot;Maltese–English Dictionary&quot; shows that words of Romance origin make up 52% of the Maltese vocabulary, although other sources claim from 40% to 55%. Romance vocabulary tends to deal with more complex concepts. Most words come from Sicilian and thus exhibit Sicilian phonetic characteristics, such as rather than Italian , and rather than Italian (e.g. not and not ). Also, as with Old Sicilian, (English &quot;sh&quot;) is written &quot;x&quot; and this produces spellings such as: (&#x27;embassy&#x27;), (&#x27;scene&#x27;; compare Italian , ).

A tendency in modern Maltese is to adopt further influences from English and Italian.
Complex Latinate English words adopted into Maltese are often given Italian or Sicilian forms, even if the resulting words do not appear in either of those languages. For instance, the words &quot;evaluation&quot;, &quot;industrial action&quot;, and &quot;chemical armaments&quot; become , , and in Maltese, while the Italian terms are , , and respectively. (The origin of the terms may be narrowed even further to British English; the phrase &quot;industrial action&quot; is meaningless in the United States.) This is comparable to the situation with English borrowings into the Italo-Australian dialect. English words of Germanic origin are generally preserved relatively unchanged.

Some influences of African Romance on the Arabic and Berber spoken in the Maghreb are theorised; these may then have passed into Maltese. For example, in calendar month names, the word &#x27;February&#x27; is only found in the Maghreb and in Maltese – proving the word&#x27;s ancient pedigree. The region also has a form of another Latin month in &lt; . This word does not appear to be a loan word through Arabic, and may have been taken over directly from Late Latin or African Romance. Scholars theorise that a Latin-based system provided forms such as and in African Romance, with the system then mediating Latin/Romance names through Arabic for some month names during the Islamic period. The same situation exists for Maltese which mediated words from Italian, and retains both non-Italian forms such as and , and Italian forms such as .

===Berber===
Like the Maghrebi Arabic dialects, Maltese has a significant vocabulary derived from Berber languages. Whether these words entered Maltese by being inherited from Siculo-Arabic or were directly loaned from Berber languages is not yet known. These include:
===English===
English loanwords, which are becoming more commonplace, may constitute up to 20% of Maltese vocabulary, though other sources claim as little as 6%. This percentage discrepancy is due to the fact that a number of new English loanwords are sometimes not considered part of the official Maltese vocabulary, hence they are not included in certain dictionaries. Also, English loanwords of Latinate origin are very often Italianized, as discussed above. English loanwords are generally transliterated, although standard English pronunciation is virtually always retained. Below are a few examples:
&quot;Fridge&quot; is a common shortening of &quot;refrigerator&quot;. &quot;Refrigerator&quot; is a Latinate word which could be imported into Maltese as &quot;rifriġeratori&quot;, whereas the Italian word is &quot;frigorifero&quot; or &quot;refrigeratore&quot;.

=== Calendar ===
The days of the week (Maltese: &quot;jiem il-ġimgħa&quot;) in Maltese, which are derived from Arabic, are referred to by number which is also typical in other Semitic languages, Days of the week are commonly preceded by the word &quot;nhar&quot; meaning &#x27;day&#x27;.

The months of the year (Maltese: ) in Maltese are mostly derived from Sicilian, though and may be derived from African Romance via Siculo-Arabic.

==Grammar==
Maltese grammar is fundamentally derived from Arabic, although Latin and English noun pluralisation patterns are also used on borrowed words.

===Adjectives and adverbs===
Adjectives follow nouns. There are no separately formed native adverbs, and word order is fairly flexible. Both nouns and adjectives of Semitic origin take the definite article (for example, , lit. &quot;The boy the elder&quot;=&quot;The elder boy&quot;). This rule does not apply to adjectives of Romance origin.

===Nouns===
Nouns are pluralised and also have a dual marker. Semitic plurals are complex; if they are regular, they are marked by &quot;-iet&quot;/&quot;-ijiet&quot;, e.g., &quot;art&quot;, &quot;artijiet&quot; &quot;lands (territorial possessions or property)&quot; (cf. Arabic &quot;-at&quot; and Hebrew &quot;-ot&quot;/&quot;-oth&quot;) or &quot;-in&quot; (cf. Arabic &quot;-īn&quot; and Hebrew &quot;-im&quot;). If irregular, they fall in the &quot;pluralis fractus&quot; (broken plural) category, in which a word is pluralised by internal vowel changes: &quot;ktieb&quot;, &quot;kotba&quot; &quot; book&quot;, &quot;books&quot;; &quot;raġel&quot;, &quot;irġiel&quot; &quot;man&quot;, &quot;men&quot;.

Words of Romance origin are usually pluralised in two manners: addition of &quot;-i&quot; or &quot;-jiet&quot;. For example, &quot;lingwa&quot;, &quot;lingwi&quot; &quot;languages&quot;, from Sicilian &quot;lingua&quot;, &quot;lingui&quot;.

Words of English origin are pluralised by adding either an &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;-jiet&quot;, for example, &quot;friġġ&quot;, &quot;friġis&quot; from the word &quot;fridge&quot;. Some words can be pluralised with either of the suffixes to denote the plural. A few words borrowed from English can amalgamate both suffixes, like &quot;brikksa&quot; from the English &quot;brick&quot;, which can adopt either collective form &quot;brikks&quot; or the plural form &quot;brikksiet&quot;.

====Derivation====

As in Arabic, nouns are often derived by changing, adding or removing the vowels within a triliteral root. These are some of the patterns used for nouns:

* CaCiC – &quot;xadin&quot; (monkey), &quot;sadid&quot; (rust)
* CCiC – &quot;żbib&quot; (raisin)
* CaCCa – &quot;baqra&quot; (cow), &quot;basla&quot; (onion)
* CeCCa – &quot;werqa&quot; (leaf), &quot;xewqa&quot; (wish)
* CoCCa – &quot;borka&quot; (wild duck), &quot;forka&quot; (gallows)
* CaCC – &quot;qalb&quot; (heart), &quot;sajd&quot; (fishing)
* CeCC – &quot;kelb&quot; (dog), &quot;xemx&quot; (sun)
* CCuCija – &quot;tfulija&quot; (childhood), &quot;xbubija&quot; (maidenhood)
* CCuCa – &quot;rtuba&quot; (softness), &quot;bjuda&quot; (whiteness)
* CaCCaC – &quot;tallab&quot; (beggar), &quot;bajjad&quot; (whitewasher)

The so-called mimated nouns use the prefix &quot;m-&quot; in addition to vowel changes. This pattern can be used to indicate place names, tools, abstractions, etc. These are some of the patterns used for mimated nouns:

* ma-CCeC – &quot;marden&quot; (spindle)
* mi-CCeC – &quot;minkeb&quot; (elbow), &quot;miżwed&quot; (pod)
* mu-CCaC – &quot;musmar&quot; (nail), &quot;munqar&quot; (beak)

===Article===
The proclitic &quot;il-&quot; is the definite article, equivalent to &quot;the&quot; in English and &quot;al-&quot; in Arabic.

The Maltese article becomes &quot;l-&quot; before or after a vowel.
* &quot;l-omm&quot; (the mother)
* &quot;rajna l-Papa&quot; (we saw the Pope)
* &quot;il-missier&quot; (the father)

The Maltese article assimilates to a following non-ġ coronal consonant (called &quot;konsonanti xemxin&quot; &quot;sun consonants&quot;), namely:
* Ċ &quot;iċ-ċikkulata&quot; (the chocolate)
* D &quot;id-dar&quot; (the house)
* N &quot;in-nar&quot; (the fire)
* R &quot;ir-razzett&quot; (the farm)
* S &quot;is-serrieq&quot; (the saw)
* T &quot;it-tifel&quot; (the child)
* X &quot;ix-xemx&quot; (the sun)
* Ż &quot;iż-żarbuna&quot; (the shoe)
* Z &quot;iz-zalzett&quot; (the sausage)

===Verbs===
Verbs show the Semitic triliteral pattern, in which a verb is conjugated with prefixes, suffixes, and infixes (for example &quot;ktibna&quot;, Arabic &quot;katabna&quot;, Hebrew &quot;kathabhnu&quot; (Modern Hebrew: katavnu) &quot;we wrote&quot;). An example is the Semitic root X-M-X (&#x27;sun&#x27;), for example &quot;xemx&quot; (sun), &quot;xmux&quot; (suns), &quot;xemxi&quot; (sunny), &quot;xemxata&quot; (sunstroke), &quot;nixxemmex&quot; (I sunbathe), &quot;ma xxemmixtx&quot; (I didn&#x27;t sunbathe), &quot;tixmix&quot; (the act of sunbathing). 

Maltese also features the agglutination of verb suffixes indicating direction of action, for example &quot;agħmilhomli&quot; &quot;make them for me&quot;← &quot;agħmel&quot; &quot;make&quot; in the imperative + &quot;hom&quot; from &quot;huma&quot; &quot;them&quot; + &quot;li&quot; suffix indicating first person singular and &quot;ħasletielu&quot; &quot;she washed it for him&quot;←&quot;ħaslet&quot; &quot;she washed&quot; from the verb &quot;ħasel&quot; &quot;to wash&quot; + &quot;ie&quot; the object + &quot;lu&quot; suffix indicating third person masculine singular.

The two tenses are present and perfect. The Maltese verb system incorporates Romance verbs and adds Maltese suffixes and prefixes to them, for example; &quot;iddeċidejna&quot; &quot;we decided&quot; ← &quot;(i)ddeċieda&quot; &quot;decide&quot;, a Romance verb + &quot;-ejna&quot;, a Maltese first person plural perfect marker.

==Media==

As Malta is a multilingual country, the use of Maltese in the mass media is shared with other European languages, namely English and Italian. The majority of television stations broadcast from Malta in English or Maltese, although broadcasts from Italy in Italian are also received on the islands. Similarly, there are more Maltese-language radio programs than English ones broadcast from Malta, but again, Italian broadcasts are also picked up. Coverage in newspaper periodicals is generally equally split between Maltese and English.

Maltese is little used on the internet and few websites are written in the language. In a survey of Maltese cultural websites conducted in 2004 on behalf of the Maltese government, 12 of 13 were in English only and the remaining one was multilingual but did not include Maltese. In 2011, only 6.5 per cent of Maltese internet users reported employing Maltese online, which may be a consequence of the lack of online support for the language.

==Code-switching==
The Maltese population, being fluent in both Maltese and English, displays code-switching (referred to as Maltenglish) in certain localities and between certain social groups.

<doc id="19032" wikidata="Q445807" url="?curid=19032" title="Masaki Kobayashi">
<text>was a Japanese film director and screenwriter, best known for the epic trilogy &quot;The Human Condition&quot; (1959–1961), the samurai films &quot;Harakiri&quot; (1962) and &quot;Samurai Rebellion&quot; (1967), and the horror anthology &quot;Kwaidan&quot; (1964). &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot; described him as &quot;one of the finest depicters of Japanese society in the 1950s and 1960s.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life (1916–1946)===
====Childhood and schooling (1916–1942)====
Kobayashi was born on February 14, 1916, in Otaru, a port city on the island of Hokkaido. Kobayashi&#x27;s family was a part of the upper-middle class, as his father, Yuichi, worked for Mitsui &amp; Co., and his mother, Hisako, was part of a merchant family. He had two older brothers and a younger sister. He was also a second cousin of the actress and director Kinuyo Tanaka. The Kobayashi family descends from a samurai from Shimonoseki. Kobayashi lived in Tokyo while in elementary school, but otherwise lived in Otaru until he was 17 years-old. Kobayashi&#x27;s household was warm and tolerant, and his parents encouraged the exploration of the arts. He saw a movie for the first time when he was 7 years-old, and he frequently watched movies and visited art exhibitions, concerts, and theatre performances with his mother. Kobayashi&#x27;s older brother, Yasuhiko, who attended film study groups while in university, also helped further Kobayashi&#x27;s understanding of film.

In 1938, Kobayashi enrolled in Waseda University in Tokyo. At the university, Kobayashi was taught by Aizu Yaichi, a poet and historian who became a mentor of Kobayashi and influenced Kobayashi&#x27;s perspectives on life and art. Aizu specialized in Buddhist art, particularly that of the Nara period, and frequently brought his class to Buddhist temples. Outside of class, Kobayashi accompanied Aizu on trips to Nara and often visited Aizu&#x27;s house. Due in part to Aizu&#x27;s influence, Kobayashi decided to study East Asian art and philosophy. Kobayashi wrote his thesis on Murō-ji, a Buddhist temple located in Nara. He spent a month living at Murō-ji while researching its history for his thesis. Kobayashi would later work on a documentary about Aizu released in 1996.

While attending Waseda University, Kobayashi would visit Shochiku Studio to watch Kinuyo Tanaka, his second cousin, while she worked. It was during his time at Waseda University that Kobayashi began to want to become a film director.

After graduating from Waseda University in 1941, Kobayashi worked at Shochiku as a director in training for eight months. While at Shochiku, Kobayashi assisted Hiroshi Shimizu on &quot;Dawn Chorus&quot; and Hideo Ōba on &quot;Kaze kaoru niwa&quot;. During this time, Kobayashi began writing a book set in Nara, about an Oriental art scholar who enlisted in the army.

====Wartime (1942-1946)====
In January 1942, Kobayashi was drafted into the Azabu Third Regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army. After three months of training as a heavy machine gunner, Kobayashi was sent near Harbin in Manchuria. In September 1943, Kobayashi&#x27;s squad was sent to patrol along the Ussuri river. In June 1944, his regiment returned to Japan, from which they were to be transferred to the Philippines. However, Allied submarines prevented the Azabu Third Regiment from reaching the Philippines, so they headed for Okinawa Island instead. While traveling to Okinawa, Kobayashi&#x27;s group diverted to Miyako-jima in the Ryukyu Islands, where they remained until the end of the war. During that time, his group worked towards building an airfield. Kobayashi&#x27;s time on the island was difficult, with his group frequently resorting to eating grasshoppers and dogs to survive. He kept a diary during his time on Miyako-jima, which documented his experience in the war and included an I-novel about the loss of his youth. In his diary, Kobayashi shows support for the Japanese war effort, but laments the death and destruction that the war caused. Kobayashi never participated in frontline fighting during his time in the army. Kobayashi regarded himself as a pacifist and a socialist, and resisted by refusing promotion to a rank higher than private.

After the war ended, Kobayashi spent nearly a year in a prisoner of war labor camp in Kadena, Okinawa. At the camp, Kobayashi ran a theater company with other inmates, and produced several shows. Kobayashi was released from the labor camp in November 1946. Upon returning home, he learned that his father had died in 1945 and that his older brother, Yasuhiko, died in battle in China in 1944.

===Film career (1946–1996)===
====Assisting Kinoshita (1946–1953)====
After returning to Japan in 1946, Kobayashi rejoined Shochiku as assistant. He was initially assigned to assist Keisuke Sasaki, but then was assigned to Keisuke Kinoshita. During his time helping Kinoshita, Kobayashi grew to admire the compassion, intelligence and skill in directing of Kinoshita. The two bonded over shared experiences in the war and in the deaths of their mothers. Kobayashi&#x27;s first job under Kinoshita was as a second assistant director on &quot;Phoenix&quot; in 1947. In 1948, Kobayashi was promoted to the position of chief assistant director on &quot;Apostasy&quot;. He remained as a chief assistant director for the rest of his time spent as an assistant to Kinoshita. In 1949, Kobayashi co-scripted &quot;Broken Drum&quot; with Kinoshita. The final Kinoshita film that Kobayashi assisted with was &quot;A Japanese Tragedy&quot;, released in 1953. In 1953, Kinoshita began looking for material that could be adapted for Kobayashi&#x27;s debut film. Kinoshita had Shochiku purchase the rights to the &quot;Jinkō Teien&quot; novel, with the intent of the novel being used for Kobayashi&#x27;s debut film. Kinoshita would end up adapting the novel himself in the 1954 film &quot;The Garden of Women&quot;.

====Early films (1953-1959)====
Kobayashi&#x27;s directorial debut was in 1952 with &quot;My Son&#x27;s Youth&quot;. This film was part of an initiative by Shochiku to release short films, called &quot;sister films&quot;, that were intended as introductions to new directors. On April 1, 1952, Kobayashi married Chiyoko Fumiya, an actress at Shochiku. In 1953, &quot;Sincerity&quot; was released, which was Kobayashi&#x27;s first feature length film. The film was written by Kobayashi&#x27;s mentor, Keisuke Kinoshita. Both &quot;My Son&#x27;s Youth&quot; and &quot;Sincerity&quot; drew inspiration from Kobayashi&#x27;s family and childhood, with some of the characters being modeled after members of his family.

In 1953, Kobayashi finished filming &quot;The Thick-Walled Room&quot;, about Class B and Class C war criminals being held in Sugamo Prison. The film was based on the diaries of real war criminals and was a substantial departure from the type of films Shochiku typically at that time. Shochiku initially refused to release &quot;The Thick-Walled Room&quot; without alteration, due to the Japan government&#x27;s fear that the film&#x27;s criticism of the Allied occupation of Japan would upset the United States. Kobayashi refused to cut any content, so the film was not released until 1956. &quot;The Thick-Walled Room&quot; hurt Kobayashi&#x27;s reputation within Shochiku, so he attempted to reestablish himself by making his next four films more similar to the typical style of Shochiku.

In 1954, &quot;Three Loves&quot; was released. This film features scenes shot inside the same church that Kobayashi and Chiyoko Fumiya were married in. Later in 1954, &quot;Somewhere Under the Broad Sky&quot; was released. This film included the first appearance of Keiji Sada in a Kobayashi-directed film, who was close friends with Kobayashi and would go on to appear in 6 of Kobayashi&#x27;s films. In 1956, &quot;Fountainhead&quot; was released, which was the last of Kobayashi&#x27;s films that strongly resembled the typical Shochiku style.

In 1956, &quot;The Thick-Walled Room&quot; was released to the public. Later that year, &quot;I Will Buy You&quot; was released, about corruption in baseball scouting. In 1957, &quot;Black River&quot; was released, about the crime and prostitution that arose around US bases in Japan during and after the American occupation. This was the first of Kobayashi&#x27;s films to star Tatsuya Nakadai in a major role. Nakadai would become a mainstay of Kobayashi&#x27;s film, starring in 9 of Kobayashi&#x27;s next 13 films.

====Peak of recognition (1959-1967)====
From 1959 to 1961, Kobayashi directed &quot;The Human Condition&quot; (1959–1961), a trilogy on the effects of World War II on a Japanese pacifist and socialist. The total length of the films is almost ten hours, which makes it one of the longest fiction films ever made for theatrical release.

In 1962 he directed &quot;Harakiri&quot;, which won the Jury Prize at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival.

In 1964, Kobayashi made &quot;Kwaidan&quot; (1964), his first color film, a collection of four ghost stories drawn from books by Lafcadio Hearn. Kwaidan won the Special Jury Prize at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.

====Later films (1967-1996)====
In 1968, Akira Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Kon Ichikawa and Kobayashi founded the directors group, &quot;Shiki no kai&quot;-&quot;The Four Horsemen Club&quot;, in an attempt to create movies for younger generations.

In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 19th Berlin International Film Festival.

He was also a candidate for directing the Japanese sequences for &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; after Akira Kurosawa left the film. But instead Kinji Fukasaku and Toshio Masuda were chosen.

In 1990, Kobayashi was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese government and the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government.

One of his grand projects was a film on Yasushi Inoue&#x27;s novel about Buddhist China, &quot;Tun Huang&quot;, which never came to fruition.

<text>The word Mormon most colloquially denotes an adherent, practitioner, follower, or constituent of Mormonism in restorationist Christianity. &quot;Mormon&quot; also commonly refers, specifically, to a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which is often colloquially, but imprecisely, referred to as the &quot;Mormon Church&quot;. In addition, the term &quot;Mormon&quot; may refer to any of the relatively small sects of Mormon fundamentalism, and any branch of the Latter Day Saint movement that recognizes Brigham Young as the successor to founder Joseph Smith. The term &quot;Mormon&quot; applies to the religion of Mormonism, as well as its culture, texts, and art.

The term derives from the Book of Mormon, published in 1830 and regarded by the faith as a sacred text and supplemental testament to the Bible. Adherents believe that the book was translated from an ancient record by Smith by the gift and power of God. The text is said to be an ancient chronicle of a fallen and lost indigenous American nation, compiled by the prophet–historian and warrior, Mormon and his son, Moroni, the last of the Nephites.

The term &quot;Mormon&quot; was applied to members of the church Smith founded in the 1830s by those outside the faith due to early believers only calling themselves &quot;the Church of Christ&quot; and &quot;saints&quot;, which was the same terminology used by the Campbellites only a few miles away. Therefore, like the Campbellites, the term &quot;Mormonite&quot; was applied to the new religious movement by outsiders to distinguish it from other Christian sects. The term &quot;Mormon&quot; was later embraced by members of the faith. Different denominations have made efforts in the years since to embrace the term &quot;Mormon&quot; as their own or distance themselves from it.

==Origin of the term==

The term &quot;Mormon&quot; is taken from the title of the Book of Mormon, a text adherents consider sacred and believe was translated from golden plates whose location was revealed by an angel to Joseph Smith and which was published in 1830. According to the text of the Book of Mormon, the word Mormon stems from the Land of Mormon, where the prophet Alma preached the gospel and baptized converts. Mormon—who was named after the land—was a 4th-century prophet–historian who compiled and abridged many records of his ancestors into the Book of Mormon. The book is believed by Latter Day Saints to be a literal record of God&#x27;s dealings with pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas from approximately 2600 BC through AD 420, written by prophets and followers of Jesus Christ. The book records the teachings of Jesus Christ to the people in the Americas as well as Christ&#x27;s personal ministry among the people of Nephi after his resurrection. The LDS Church teaches that the Book of Mormon is another witness of Jesus Christ, &quot;holy scripture comparable to the Bible&quot;.

The terms &quot;Mormonism&quot;and &quot;Mormonite&quot; were originally descriptive terms invented in 1831 by newspaper editors or contributors in Ohio and New York to describe the growing movement of &quot;proselytes of the Golden Bible&quot;. Historian Ardis Parshall quotes an 1831 news item, appearing within the first year of the LDS Church&#x27;s founding, as reading, &quot;In the sixth number of your paper I saw a notice of a sect of people called Mormonites; and thinking that a fuller history of their founder, Joseph Smith, Jr., might be interesting to your community ... I will take the trouble to make a few remarks on the character of that infamous imposter.&quot; The term &quot;Mormon&quot; developed as a shortened version of &quot;Mormonite&quot; a year or two later. By the 1840s the term was adopted by Mormon leaders to refer to themselves, though leaders occasionally used the term as early as 1833. The term also started to be used pejoratively sometime before 1844 with the coinage of the term Jack Mormon to describe non-Mormons sympathetic to the movement. Since that time the term &quot;Mormon&quot; has generally lost its pejorative status, as it became reappropriated. According to LDS Church historian Matthew Bowman, and by the end of the 1800s it was broadly used.

==Popular usage==
Several schisms in the Latter Day Saint movement have resulted in dozens of denominations, each with their own preferred terminology. Today, the term &quot;Mormon&quot; is often used to refer to members of the largest denomination, the LDS Church, which rejects &quot;Mormon&quot; as a reference term as of 2018. The second-largest sect, the Community of Christ, also rejects the term &quot;Mormon&quot; due to its association with the practice of polygamy among Brighamite sects. Smaller sects often adopted the term, including adherents of Mormon fundamentalism. Due to the size and influence of the LDS Church, it tends to dominate discussions of how &quot;Mormon&quot; is used.

The term &quot;Mormon&quot; is frequently embraced by adherents of Mormon fundamentalism, who continue to believe in and practice plural marriage, and consider themselves to be the true successors of the LDS church or hide among the membership of the LDS church. Seeking to distance itself from polygamy and Mormon fundamentalism, prior to August 2018 the Church of Jesus Christ had taken the position that the term &quot;Mormon&quot; should only apply to itself and its members, and not other adherents who have adopted the term. It cited a now-obsolete &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; which stated, &quot;The term Mormon is not properly applied to the other Latter Day Saint churches that resulted from the split after [Joseph] Smith&#x27;s death.&quot;

Despite the LDS Church requesting since August 2018 that all press and publications no longer refer to it as the Mormon Church or adherents as Mormons, the term is still in considerable use by journalists and non-journalists to refer to adherents of church and Mormon fundamentalists alike for brevity and due to their shared history of polygamy.

==Usage preferred by the LDS Church==

The terminology preferred by the LDS Church has varied over time. At various points, the church has embraced the term &quot;Mormon&quot; and stated that other sects within the shared faith tradition should not be called Mormon. At other times, the church has rejected the term Mormon altogether except in extremely limited uses.

The LDS Church has made efforts, including in 1982, in 2001 prior to the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, in 2011 after &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; appeared on Broadway, and again in 2018, to encourage the use of the church&#x27;s full name rather than the terms Mormon or LDS.

Around 2010, the LDS Church and its members experienced a &quot;Mormon moment&quot; in which they were thrust into the national spotlight by Mitt Romney&#x27;s 2008 and 2012 campaigns for President of the United States and the 2011 Broadway musical titled &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;. Facing media attention and abundant negative stereotypes, the church actively fostered its &quot;Mormon&quot; nickname with a multinational &quot;I&#x27;m a Mormon&quot; ad campaign (2010-2018), the film &quot;Meet the Mormons&quot; (2014), and websites like mormon.org and mormonandgay.org.

In 2018, the church reversed course again after Russell M. Nelson became church president. In August 2018, Nelson announced a renewed effort to discourage the use of the word &quot;Mormon&quot; in reference to itself and its members, saying that terms like &quot;Mormon Church&quot; offended Jesus and were a &quot;major victory for Satan&quot;. The church followed up with a major renaming, with its websites at lds.org and mormon.org merged to a new website at churchofjesuschrist.org; the Mormon Tabernacle Choir becoming the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, and the church-affiliated publishing house Deseret Book began phasing out book titles that used the word &quot;Mormon&quot;.

In 2018, the LDS Church published a style guide that encourages the use of the terms &quot;the Church,&quot; the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ&quot; or the &quot;restored Church of Jesus Christ&quot; as shortened versions after an initial use of the full name. According to church historian Bowman, &#x27;the term &quot;restored&quot; refers to the idea that the original Christian religion is obsolete, and Mormons alone are practicing true Christianity.&#x27; The 2018 style guide rejects the term Mormons along with &quot;Mormon Church&quot;, &quot;Mormonism&quot;, and the abbreviation LDS.

According to Patrick Mason, chair of Mormon studies at Claremont Graduate University and Richard Bennett, a professor of church history at Brigham Young University, this is because non-church members have historically been confused about whether it represents a Christian faith, which concerns church leaders, who want to emphasize that the church is a Christian church. The term Mormon also causes concern for church leaders because it has been used to include groups such as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints who continued to practice polygamy after the Second Manifesto of 1904. Mason said &quot;For more than 100 years, the mainstream LDS church has gone to great pains to distance itself from those who practice polygamy. It doesn&#x27;t want to have any confusion there between those two groups.&quot;

In some countries, &quot;Mormon&quot; and some phrases including the term are registered trademarks owned by Intellectual Reserve, a holding company for the LDS Church&#x27;s intellectual property. In the United States, the LDS Church has applied for a trademark on &quot;Mormon&quot; as applied to religious services; however, the United States Patent and Trademark Office rejected the application, stating that the term &quot;Mormon&quot; was too generic, and is popularly understood as referring to a particular kind of church, similar to &quot;Presbyterian&quot; or &quot;Methodist&quot;, rather than a service mark. The application was abandoned as of August 22, 2007. In all, Intellectual Reserve owns more than 60 trademarks related to the term &quot;Mormon&quot;.

Despite the LDS Church&#x27;s position, the terms Mormon and LDS in 2023 remain widely used both inside and outside the church to refer to members of the main church and &quot;Fundamentalist Mormon&quot; or &quot;Fundamentalist LDS&quot; to refer to members of fundamentalist splinter groups.

== Scholarly usage ==
J. Gordon Melton, in his &quot;Encyclopedia of American Religions&quot;, subdivides the Mormons into &quot;Utah Mormons&quot;, &quot;Missouri Mormons&quot;, &quot;Polygamy-Practicing Mormons&quot;, and &quot;Other Mormons&quot;. In this scheme, the &quot;Utah Mormon&quot; group includes the non-polygamous organizations descending from those Mormons who followed Brigham Young to what is now Utah. The LDS Church is by far the largest of these groups, with a December 2022 membership count totaling 17,002,461 worldwide and the only group to initially reside in Utah.

The &quot;Missouri Mormon&quot; groups include those non-polygamous groups that chose not to travel to Utah and are currently headquartered in Missouri, which Joseph Smith designated as the future site of the New Jerusalem. These organizations include Community of Christ, Church of Christ (Temple Lot), Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and others.

&quot;Polygamy-Practicing Mormon&quot; groups are those that currently practice polygamy, regardless of location. Most notably, this category includes the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB).

&quot;Other Mormon&quot; groups include those that are not headquartered in Utah or Missouri and do not practice polygamy, such as The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite).

The terms &quot;Utah Mormon&quot; and &quot;Missouri Mormon&quot; cannot be interpreted to mean more than the location of the various groups&#x27; headquarters, as the majority of members of &quot;Utah Mormon&quot; groups and &quot;Missouri Mormon&quot; groups no longer live in either of these US states. Although a majority of Utahns are members of the LDS Church, it has a worldwide membership with the majority of its members outside the United States; and most &quot;Missouri Mormons&quot; do not live in Missouri.

==Meaning of the word==
The May 15, 1843, issue of the official Latter Day Saint periodical &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; contains an article, purportedly written by Joseph Smith, deriving the etymology of the name &quot;Mormon&quot; from English &quot;more&quot; + Egyptian &quot;mon&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, and extolling the meaning as follows:
It has been stated that this word [mormon] was derived from the Greek word &quot;mormo&quot;. This is not the case. There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of God, translated the Book of Mormon. Let the language of that book speak for itself. On the 523d page, of the fourth edition, it reads: And now behold we have written this record according to our knowledge in the characters which are called among us the &quot;Reformed Egyptian&quot; ... none other people knoweth our language; therefore [God] hath prepared means for the interpretation thereof.&quot; ... [The] Bible in its widest sense, means &quot;good&quot;; for the Savior says according to the gospel of John, &quot;I am the &quot;good&quot; shepherd;&quot; and it will not be beyond the common use of terms, to say that good is among the most important in use, and though known by various names in different languages, still its meaning is the same, and is ever in opposition to &quot;bad&quot;. We say from the Saxon, &quot;good&quot;; the Dane, &quot;god&quot;; the Goth, &quot;goda&quot;; the German, &quot;gut&quot;; the Dutch, &quot;goed&quot;; the Latin, &quot;bonus&quot;; the Greek, &quot;kalos&quot;; the Hebrew, &quot;tob&quot;; and the Egyptian, &quot;mon&quot;. Hence, with the addition of &quot;more&quot;, or the contraction, &quot;mor&quot;, we have the word MOR-MON; which means, literally, &quot;more good&quot;.
Whether Smith was the actual author of this passage is uncertain. Official LDS Church historian B. H. Roberts removed the quote from his &quot;History of the Church&quot; compilation, saying he found evidence that W. W. Phelps wrote that paragraph and that it was &quot;based on inaccurate premises and was offensively pedantic.&quot; LDS Church apostle Gordon B. Hinckley noted that the &quot;more good&quot; translation is incorrect but added that &quot;&quot;Mormon&quot; means &#x27;more good&#x27;&quot; is a positive motto for members of the LDS Church.

===Meaning in the Book of Mormon===

The Book of Mormon&#x27;s title page begins, &quot;The Book of Mormon: An account written by the hand of Mormon&quot; (). According to the book, Mormon compiled nearly 1000 years of writings as well as chronicled events during his lifetime. Most of the text of the Book of Mormon consists of this compilation and his own writings. However, the name &quot;Mormon&quot; is also used in the Book of Mormon as a place name (e.g. Waters of Mormon).
:5 states, &quot;And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and my father&#x27;s name was Mormon)...&quot;, whereas :12 states, &quot;And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people yea, the first church which was established among them after their transgression.&quot; Based on these verses, Latter-day Saint scholar David Lamb interprets the name of the Book of Mormon to mean &quot;Book of the Restoration of the Covenant&quot;:
[The prophet] Mormon was not named after his father; he was named after the land of Mormon. He had been taught about his heritage by his parents and understood the sacred significance associated with the name Mormon. No doubt his father also bore the name Mormon for the same reason. In 3 Nephi 5:12 he gives us a clear indication that the name Mormon is symbolically synonymous with the restoration of the covenant which took place in the land of Mormon by Alma and his people.

A study of the Introduction of the Book of Mormon tells us its main purpose is to restore a knowledge of the covenants to the house of Israel. This adds weight to the understanding that the name Mormon was always associated with the place of the restoration of the covenant to the Nephites. In fact, the name Mormon became synonymous with the concept of restoring the covenants.

In light of this understanding, the Book of Mormon is not named for a man. It is named for the place where the covenant was restored. Symbolically, the Book of Mormon bears the name &#x27;Book of the Restoration of the Covenant.&#x27;&quot;

<text>The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, about east of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures about in length and in width. The maximum known depth is at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep. The deepest point of the trench is more than farther from sea level than the peak of Mount Everest.

At the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of , more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%. The temperature at the bottom is .

In 2009, the Mariana Trench was established as a US National Monument, Mariana Trench Marine National Monument.

One-celled organisms called monothalamea have been found in the trench at a record depth of below the sea surface by researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Data has also suggested that microbial life forms thrive within the trench.

==Etymology==
The Mariana Trench is named after the nearby Mariana Islands, which are named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria. The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.

==Geology==

The Mariana Trench is part of the Izu–Bonin–Mariana subduction system that forms the boundary between two tectonic plates. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the Pacific plate, is subducted (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller Mariana plate that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on Earth (up to 170 million years old), and is, therefore, cooler and denser; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.

The movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands. These volcanic islands are caused by flux melting of the upper mantle due to the release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific plate.

==Research history==
The trench was first sounded during the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition in 1875 using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of . In 1877, a map was published called &quot;Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans&quot; (&quot;Depth map of the Great Ocean&quot;) by Petermann, which showed a &quot;Challenger Tief&quot; (&quot;Challenger deep&quot;) at the location of that sounding. In 1899, , a converted collier, recorded a depth of .

In 1951, under Chief Scientist Thomas Gaskell, &quot;Challenger II&quot; surveyed the trench using echo sounding, a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the &quot;Challenger II&quot; measured a depth of at , known as the Challenger Deep.

In 1957, the Soviet vessel reported a depth of at a location dubbed the &quot;Mariana Hollow&quot;.

In 1962, the surface ship M.V. &quot;Spencer F. Baird&quot; recorded a maximum depth of using precision depth gauges.

In 1984, the Japanese survey vessel &quot;Takuyō&quot; (拓洋) collected data from the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum depth of , also reported as . Remotely Operated Vehicle &quot;KAIKO&quot; reached the deepest area of the Mariana Trench and made the deepest diving record of on 24 March 1995.

During surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had a depth similar to the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey. This new spot was named the HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep, after the group of scientists who discovered it.

On 1 June 2009, mapping aboard the (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), indicated a spot with a depth of . The sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep was possible by its Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water. The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying that the depth figure is accurate to ± ).&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scientic Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to resolution. The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.

The Mariana Trench was a site chosen by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the subsurface water cycle. Using both ocean-bottom seismometers and hydrophones, the scientists were able to map structures as deep as beneath the surface.

===Descents===

As of 2022, 22 crewed descents and seven uncrewed descents have been achieved. The first was the crewed descent by Swiss-designed, Italian-built, United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot;, which reached the bottom at 1:06 pm on 23 January 1960, with Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on board. Iron shot was used for ballast, with gasoline for buoyancy. The onboard systems indicated a depth of , but this was later revised to . The depth was estimated from a conversion of pressure measured and calculations based on the water density from sea surface to seabed.

This was followed by the uncrewed ROVs &quot;Kaikō&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Nereus&quot; in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very similar depths of . The fourth was made by Canadian film director James Cameron on 26 March 2012. He reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the submersible vessel &quot;Deepsea Challenger&quot;, diving to a depth of .

In July 2015, members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oregon State University, and the Coast Guard submerged a hydrophone into the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep, never having previously deployed one past a mile. The titanium-shelled hydrophone was designed to withstand the immense pressure under. Although researchers were unable to retrieve the hydrophone until November, the data capacity was full within the first 23 days. After months of analyzing the sounds, the experts were surprised to pick up natural sounds like earthquakes, typhoons, baleen whales, and machine-made sounds such as boats. Due to the mission&#x27;s success, the researchers announced plans to deploy a second hydrophone in 2017 for an extended period of time.

Victor Vescovo achieved a new record descent to on 28 April 2019 using the DSV &quot;Limiting Factor&quot;, a Triton 36000/2 model manufactured by Florida-based Triton Submarines. He dived four times between 28 April and 5 May 2019, becoming the first person to dive into Challenger Deep more than once.

On 8 May 2020, a joint project between the Russian shipbuilders, scientific teams of the Russian Academy of Sciences with the support of the Russian Foundation for Advanced Research Projects and the Pacific Fleet submerged the autonomous underwater vehicle &quot;Vityaz-D&quot; to the bottom of the Mariana Trench at a depth of . &quot;Vityaz-D&quot; is the first underwater vehicle to operate autonomously at the extreme depths of the Mariana Trench. The duration of the mission, excluding diving and surfacing, was more than 3 hours.

On 10 November 2020, the Chinese submersible &quot;Fendouzhe&quot; reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench at a depth of .

== Life ==
The expedition conducted in 1960 claimed to have observed, with great surprise because of the high pressure, large creatures living at the bottom, such as a flatfish about long, and shrimp. According to Piccard, &quot;The bottom appeared light and clear, a waste of firm diatomaceous ooze&quot;. Many marine biologists are now skeptical of the supposed sighting of the flatfish, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber. During the second expedition, the uncrewed vehicle &quot;Kaikō&quot; collected mud samples from the seabed. Tiny organisms were found to be living in those samples.

In July 2011, a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called drop cams, equipped with digital video cameras and lights to explore this deep-sea region. Among many other living organisms, some gigantic single-celled foraminiferans with a size of more than , belonging to the class of monothalamea, were observed. Monothalamea are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abundance on the seafloor, and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.

In December 2014, a new species of snailfish was discovered at a depth of , breaking the previous record for the deepest living fish seen on video.

During the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed, including huge amphipods known as supergiants. Deep-sea gigantism is the process where species grow larger than their shallow-water relatives.

In May 2017, an unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of .

===Pollution===
In 2016, a research expedition looked at the chemical makeup of crustacean scavengers collected from the range of within the trench. Within these organisms, the researchers found extremely elevated concentrations of PCBs, a chemical toxin banned in the 1970s for its environmental harm, concentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench. Further research has found that amphipods also ingest microplastics, with 100% of amphipods having at least one piece of synthetic material in their stomachs.

In 2019, Victor Vescovo reported finding a plastic bag and candy wrappers at the bottom of the trench. That year, &quot;Scientific American&quot; also reported that carbon-14 from nuclear bomb testing has been found in the bodies of aquatic animals found in the trench.

==Possible nuclear waste disposal site==
Like other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site for nuclear waste disposal in the hope that tectonic plate subduction occurring at the site might eventually push the nuclear waste deep into the Earth&#x27;s mantle, the second layer of the Earth. In 1979 Japan planned to dump low-level nuclear wastes near Maug, in the Northern Marianas. However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is prohibited by international law. Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large megathrust earthquakes, the effects of which are unpredictable for the safety of long-term disposal of nuclear wastes within the hadopelagic ecosystem.

<text>Macedonian ( ; , , ) is an Eastern South Slavic language. It is part of the Indo-European language family, and is one of the Slavic languages, which are part of a larger Balto-Slavic branch. Spoken as a first language by around 1.6 million people, it serves as the official language of North Macedonia. Most speakers can be found in the country and its diaspora, with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational region of Macedonia. Macedonian is also a recognized minority language in parts of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, and Serbia and it is spoken by expatriate communities predominantly in Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Macedonian developed out of the western dialects of the Eastern South Slavic dialect continuum, whose earliest recorded form is Old Church Slavonic. During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called &quot;Bulgarian&quot;, although in the late 19th century, its western dialects came to be known separately as &quot;Macedonian&quot;. Standard Macedonian was codified in 1945 and has developed modern literature since. As it is part of a dialect continuum with other South Slavic languages, Macedonian has a high degree of mutual intelligibility with Bulgarian and varieties of Serbo-Croatian.

Linguists distinguish 29 dialects of Macedonian, with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of Macedonian grammar are the use of a dynamic stress that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed deictic articles that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and the use of simple and complex verb tenses. Macedonian orthography is phonemic with a correspondence of one grapheme per phoneme. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the Cyrillic script with six original letters. Macedonian syntax is the same as of all other modern Slavic languages, i.e. of the subject-verb-object (SVO) type and has flexible word order.

Macedonian vocabulary has been historically influenced by Turkish and Russian. Somewhat less prominent vocabulary influences also came from neighboring and prestige languages. The international consensus outside of Bulgaria is that Macedonian is an autonomous language within the Eastern South Slavic dialect continuum, although since Macedonian and Bulgarian are mutually intelligible and are socio-historically related, a small minority of linguists are divided in their views of the two as separate languages or as a single pluricentric language.

5 May, the day when the government of Yugoslav Macedonia adopted the Macedonian alphabet as the official script of the republic in 1945, is marked as Macedonian Language Day. This is a working holiday, declared as such by the government of North Macedonia in 2019.

==Classification and related languages==

Macedonian belongs to the eastern group of the South Slavic branch of Slavic languages in the Indo-European language family, together with Bulgarian and the extinct Old Church Slavonic. Some authors also classify the Torlakian dialects in this group. Macedonian&#x27;s closest relative is Bulgarian followed by Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, although the last is more distantly related. Together, South Slavic languages form a dialect continuum.

Macedonian, like the other Eastern South Slavic idioms has characteristics that make it part of the Balkan sprachbund, a group of languages that share typological, grammatical and lexical features based on areal convergence, rather than genetic proximity. In that sense, Macedonian has experienced convergent evolution with other languages that belong to this group such as Greek, Aromanian, Albanian and Romani due to cultural and linguistic exchanges that occurred primarily through oral communication.

Macedonian and Bulgarian are divergent from the remaining South Slavic languages in that they do not use noun cases (except for the vocative, and apart from some traces of once productive inflections still found scattered throughout these two) and have lost the infinitive. They are also the only Slavic languages with any definite articles (unlike standard Bulgarian, which uses only one article, standard Macedonian as well as some south-eastern Bulgarian dialects have a set of three deictic articles: unspecified, proximal and distal definite article). Macedonian, Bulgarian and Albanian are the only Indo-European languages that make use of the narrative mood.

According to Chambers and Trudgill, the question whether Bulgarian and Macedonian are distinct languages or dialects of a single language cannot be resolved on a purely linguistic basis, but should rather take into account sociolinguistic criteria, i.e., ethnic and linguistic identity. This view is supported by Jouko Lindstedt, who has suggested the reflex of the back yer as a potential boundary if the application of purely linguistic criteria were possible.

As for the Slavic dialects of Greece, Trudgill classifies the dialects in the east Greek Macedonia as part of the Bulgarian language area and the rest as Macedonian dialects. According to Riki van Boeschoten, dialects in eastern Greek Macedonia (around Serres and Drama) are closest to Bulgarian, those in western Greek Macedonia (around Florina and Kastoria) are closest to Macedonian, while those in the centre (Edessa and Salonica) are intermediate between the two.

==History==
The Slavic people who settled in the Balkans during the 6th century CE, spoke their own dialects and used different dialects or languages to communicate with other people. The &quot;canonical&quot; Old Church Slavonic period of the development of Macedonian started during the 9th century and lasted until the first half of the 11th century. It saw translation of Greek religious texts. The Macedonian recension of Old Church Slavonic also appeared around that period in the Bulgarian Empire and was referred to as such due to works of the Ohrid Literary School. Towards the end of the 13th century, the influence of Serbian increased as Serbia expanded its borders southward. During the five centuries of Ottoman rule, from the 15th to the 20th century, the vernacular spoken in the territory of current-day North Macedonia witnessed grammatical and linguistic changes that came to characterize Macedonian as a member of the Balkan sprachbund. This period saw the introduction of many Turkish loanwords into the language.
The latter half of the 18th century saw the rise of modern literary Macedonian through the written use of Macedonian dialects referred to as &quot;Bulgarian&quot; by writers. The first half of the 19th century saw the rise of nationalism among the South Slavic people in the Ottoman Empire. This period saw proponents of creating a common church for Bulgarian and Macedonian Slavs which would use a common modern Macedo-Bulgarian literary standard.

The period between 1840 and 1870, saw a struggle to define the dialectal base of the common language called simply &quot;Bulgarian&quot;, with two opposing views emerging. One ideology was to create a Bulgarian literary language based on Macedonian dialects, but such proposals were rejected by the Bulgarian codifiers. That period saw poetry written in the Struga dialect with elements from Russian. Textbooks also used either spoken dialectal forms of the language or a mixed Macedo-Bulgarian language. Subsequently, proponents of the idea of using a separate Macedonian language emerged.

Krste Petkov Misirkov&#x27;s book &quot;Za makedonckite raboti&quot; (&quot;On Macedonian Matters&quot;) published in 1903, was the first attempt to formalize a separate literary language. With the book, the author proposed a Macedonian grammar and expressed the goal of codifying the language and using it in schools. The author postulated the principle that the Prilep-Bitola dialect be used as a dialectal basis for the formation of the Macedonian standard language; his idea however was not adopted until the 1940s. On 2 August 1944 at the first Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) meeting, Macedonian was declared an official language. With this, it became the last of the major Slavic languages to achieve a standard literary form. As such, Macedonian served as one of the three official languages of Yugoslavia from 1945 to 1991.
==Geographical distribution==

Although the precise number of native and second language speakers of Macedonian is unknown due to the policies of neighboring countries and emigration of the population, estimates ranging between 1.4 million and 3.5 million have been reported. According to the 2002 census, the total population of North Macedonia was 2,022,547, with 1,344,815 citizens declaring Macedonian their native language. Macedonian is also studied and spoken to various degrees as a second language by all ethnic minorities in the country.

Outside North Macedonia, there are small ethnic Macedonian minorities that speak Macedonian in neighboring countries including 4.697 in Albania (1989 census), 1,609 in Bulgaria (2011 census) and 12,706 in Serbia (2011 census). The exact number of speakers of Macedonian in Greece is difficult to ascertain due to the country&#x27;s policies. Estimates of Slavophones ranging anywhere between 50,000 and 300,000 in the last decade of the 20th century have been reported. Approximately 580,000 Macedonians live outside North Macedonia per 1964 estimates with Australia, Canada, and the United States being home to the largest emigrant communities. Consequently, the number of speakers of Macedonian in these countries include 66,020 (2016 census), 15,605 (2016 census) and 22,885 (2010 census), respectively. Macedonian also has more than 50,000 native speakers in countries of Western Europe, predominantly in Germany, Switzerland and Italy.

The Macedonian language has the status of an official language only in North Macedonia, and is a recognized minority and official language in parts of Albania (Pustec), Romania, Serbia (Jabuka and Plandište) and Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are provisions to learn Macedonian in Romania as Macedonians are an officially recognized minority group. Macedonian is studied and taught at various universities across the world and research centers focusing on the language are found at universities across Europe (France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Russia) as well as Australia, Canada and the United States (Chicago and North Carolina).

==Dialects==

During the standardization process of the Macedonian language, the dialectal base selected was primarily based on the West-Central dialects, which spans the triangle of the communities Makedonski Brod, Kičevo, Demir Hisar, Bitola, Prilep, and Veles. These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions. The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in Krste Petkov Misirkov&#x27;s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighboring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.
Dialect divisions of Macedonian per Macedonian dialectology
Northern

Western/Northwestern

Eastern

Southeastern

Southwestern

Based on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups. The boundary between them geographically runs approximately from Skopje and Skopska Crna Gora along the rivers Vardar and Crna. There are numerous isoglosses between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax. The Western group of dialects can be subdivided into smaller dialectal territories, the largest group of which includes the central dialects. The linguistic territory where Macedonian dialects were spoken also span outside the country and within the region of Macedonia, including Pirin Macedonia into Bulgaria and Aegean Macedonia into Greece.

Variations in consonant pronunciation occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position ( (head): /ɡlava/ = /ɡla/: (heads): /ɡlavi/ = /ɡlaj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word, that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, elision of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and Torlakian dialects and is characterized by 46–47 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.

In addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the Proto-Slavic reduced vowels (yers), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *ǫ. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:
* Macedonian
** Western dialects
*** Ohrid-Prespa Group: Ohrid dialect, Struga dialect, Vevčani-Radožda dialect, Upper Prespa dialect and Lower Prespa dialect.
*** Debar Group: Debar dialect, Reka dialect, Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect, Small Reka dialect (&quot;Galičnik dialect&quot;), Skopska Crna Gora dialect and Gora dialect
*** Polog Group: Upper Polog dialect (&quot;Gostivar dialect&quot;), Lower Polog dialect (&quot;Tetovo dialect&quot;), Prilep-Bitola dialect, Kičevo-Poreče dialect and Skopje-Veles dialect
*** Kostur-Korča Group: Korča dialect, Kostur dialect and Nestram-Kostenar dialect
** Eastern dialects
*** Northern Group: Kumanovo dialect, Kratovo dialect, Kriva Palanka dialect and Ovče Pole dialect
*** Eastern Group: Štip - Kočani dialect, Strumica dialect, Tikveš-Mariovo dialect, Maleševo-Pirin dialect, Solun-Voden dialect and Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect.
==Phonology==
The phonological system of Standard Macedonian is based on the Prilep-Bitola dialect. Macedonian possesses five vowels, one semivowel, three liquid consonants, three nasal stops, three pairs of fricatives, two pairs of affricates, a non-paired voiceless fricative, nine pairs of voiced and unvoiced consonants and four pairs of stops. Out of all the Slavic languages, Macedonian has the most frequent occurrence of vowels relative to consonants with a typical Macedonian sentence having on average 1.18 consonants for every one vowel.

===Vowels===
The Macedonian language contains 5 vowels which are /a/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /o/, and /u/. For the pronunciation of the middle vowels /&quot;е&quot;/ and /&quot;о&quot;/ by native Macedonian speakers, various vowel sounds can be produced ranging from [ɛ] to [ẹ] and from [o] to [ọ]. Unstressed vowels are not reduced, although they are pronounced more weakly and shortly than stressed ones, especially if they are found in a stressed syllable. The five vowels and the letter &quot;р&quot; (/r/) which acts as a vowel when found between two consonants (e.g. , &quot;church&quot;), can be syllable-forming.

The schwa is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to or ) but its use in the standard language is marginal. When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an apostrophe is used; for example, , , etc. When spelling words letter-by-letters, each consonant is followed by the schwa sound. The individual letters of acronyms are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: (). The lexicalized acronyms () and () (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions. Vowel length is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllabic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. &#x27;Veles&#x27;. The sequence is often realized phonetically as ; e.g. &quot;&#x27;colloq.&quot; hour&#x27;, - snakes. In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. - to walk).
===Consonants===
The consonant inventory of the Macedonian language consists of 26 letters and distinguishes three groups of consonants (): voiced (), voiceless () and sonorant consonants (). Typical features and rules that apply to consonants in the Macedonian language include assimilation of voiced and voiceless consonants when next to each other, devoicing of vocal consonants when at the end of a word, double consonants and elision. At morpheme boundaries (represented in spelling) and at the end of a word (not represented in spelling), voicing opposition is neutralized.


===Orthography===
Similar to the Macedonian alphabet, Macedonian orthography was officially codified on 7 June 1945 at an ASNOM meeting. Rules about the orthography and orthoepy (correct pronunciation of words) were first collected and outlined in the book &quot;Правопис на македонскиот литературен јазик&quot; (&quot;Orthography of the Macedonian standard language&quot;) published in 1945. Updated versions have subsequently appeared with the most recent one published in 2016. Macedonian orthography is consistent and phonemic in practice, an approximation of the principle of one grapheme per phoneme. This one-to-one correspondence is often simply described by the principle, &quot;write as you speak and read as it is written&quot;. There is only one exception to this rule with the letter /&quot;л&quot;/ which is pronounced as /l/ before front vowels (e.g. &quot;лист&quot; (leaf); pronounced as [list]) and /j/ (e.g. &quot;полјанка&quot; (meadow); pronounced as [poljanka]) but velar /ł/ elsewhere (e.g. &quot;бела&quot; (white) pronounced as [beła]). Another sound that is not represented in the written form but is pronounced in words is the schwa.

==Political views on the language==

Politicians and scholars from North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Greece have opposing views about the existence and distinctiveness of the Macedonian language. Through history Macedonian has been referred mainly to as a variant of Bulgarian, but especially during the first half of the 20th century also as Serbian, and as a distinct language of its own. Historically, after its codification, the use of the language has been a subject of different views and internal policies in Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece. Some international scholars also maintain Macedo-Bulgarian was a single pluricentric language until the 20th century and argue that the idea of linguistic separatism emerged in the late 19th century with the advent of Macedonian nationalism and the need for a separate Macedonian standard language subsequently appeared in the early 20th century. Different linguists have argued that during its codification, the Macedonian standard language was Serbianized with regards to its orthography and vocabulary.

The government of Bulgaria, Bulgarian academics, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the general public have and continue to widely consider Macedonian part of the Bulgarian dialect area. During the Communist era, Macedonian was recognized as a minority language in Bulgaria and utilized in education from 1946 to 1948. Subsequently, it was described as a dialect of Bulgarian. In 1956 the Bulgarian government signed an agreement on mutual legal defense with Yugoslavia, where the Macedonian language is named as one of the languages to be used for legal purposes, together with Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian. The same year Bulgaria revoked its recognition of Macedonian nationhood and language and implicitly resumed its prewar position of their non-existence. In 1999 the government in Sofia signed a in the official languages of the two countries, marking the first time it agreed to sign a bilateral agreement written in Macedonian. Dialect experts of the Bulgarian language refer to the Macedonian language as &quot;македонска езикова норма&quot; (Macedonian linguistic norm) of the Bulgarian language. As of 2019, disputes regarding the language and its origins are ongoing in academic and political circles in the two countries.

The Greek scientific and local community opposed using the denomination Macedonian to refer to the language in light of the Greek-Macedonian naming dispute. Instead, the language is often called &quot;Slavic&quot;, &quot;Slavomacedonian&quot; (translated to &quot;Macedonian Slavic&quot; in English), &quot;makedonski&quot;, &quot;makedoniski&quot; (&quot;Macedonian&quot;), &quot;slaviká&quot; (Greek: &quot;Slavic&quot;), &quot;dópia&quot; or &quot;entópia&quot; (Greek: &quot;local/indigenous [language]&quot;), &quot;balgàrtzki&quot; (Bulgarian) or &quot;Macedonian&quot; in some parts of the region of Kastoria, &quot;bògartski&quot; (&quot;Bulgarian&quot;) in some parts of Dolna Prespa along with &quot;naši&quot; (&quot;our own&quot;) and &quot;stariski&quot; (&quot;old&quot;). However, with the Prespa agreement signed in June 2018 and ratified by the Greek Parliament on 25 January 2019, Greece officially recognized the name &quot;Macedonian&quot; for the language. Additionally, on 27 July 2022, in a landmark ruling, the Centre for the Macedonian Language in Greece was officially registered as a non-governmental organization. This is the first time that a cultural organization promoting the Macedonian language has been legally approved in Greece and the first legal recognition of the Macedonian language in Greece since at least 1928.

==Sample text==
The following is the Lord&#x27;s Prayer with its attached doxology in standard Macedonian.
:Оче наш (Cyrillic alphabet)

:Оче наш, кој си на небесата,
:да се свети името Твое,
:да дојде царството Твое,
:да биде волјата Твоја,
:како на небото, така и на земјата;
:лебот наш насушен дај ни го денес
:и прости ни ги долговите наши
:како и ние што им ги проштеваме на нашите должници;
:и не нѐ воведувај во искушение,
:но избави нѐ од лукавиот
:Зашто Твое е Царството и Силата и Славата, во вечни векови.
:Амин!
:Oče naš (Romanized version)

:&quot;Oče naš, koj si na nebesata&quot;
:&quot;da se sveti imeto Tvoe,&quot;
:&quot;da dojde carstvoto Tvoe,&quot;
:&quot;da bide voljata Tvoja,&quot;
:&quot;kako na neboto, taka i na zemjata;&quot;
:&quot;lebot naš nasušen daj ni go denes&quot;
:&quot;i prosti ni gi dolgovite naši&quot;
:&quot;kako i nie što im gi proštevame na našite dolžnici&quot;
:&quot;I ne nè voveduvaj vo iskušenie,&quot;
:&quot;no izbavi nè od lukaviot.&quot;
:&quot;Zašto Tvoe e Carstvoto i Silata i Slavata, vo večni vekovi.&quot;
:&quot;Amin!&quot;

<text>A municipality is usually a single administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and regional laws to which it is subordinate.

The term &quot;municipality&quot; may also mean the governing body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district.

The English word is derived from French , which in turn derives from the Latin , based on the word for social contract (), referring originally to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state (granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments (a limited autonomy).

A municipality can be any political jurisdiction, from a sovereign state such as the Principality of Monaco, to a small village such as West Hampton Dunes, New York.

The territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass:
* only one populated place such as a city, town, or village
* several such places (e.g., early jurisdictions in the U.S. state of New Jersey (1798–1899) as townships governing several villages, municipalities of Mexico, municipalities of Colombia)
* only parts of such places, sometimes boroughs of a city, such as the 34 municipalities of Santiago, Chile.

== Political powers ==

Powers of municipalities range from virtual autonomy to complete subordination to the state. Municipalities may have the right to tax individuals and corporations with income tax, property tax, and corporate income tax, but may also receive substantial funding from the state. In some European countries, such as Germany, municipalities have the constitutional right to supply public services through municipally-owned public utility companies.

== Terms in various countries ==


=== Municipality ===
Terms cognate with &quot;municipality&quot;, mostly referring to territory or political structure, are Spanish &#x27; (Spain) and &#x27; (Chile), Catalan &quot;&quot;, Portuguese .

* In Brazil, a &quot;município&quot; is the local government, recognized by the Brazilian Federal Constitution and established through state constitutions. It is the smallest territorial division holding executive and legislative powers. Since the Constitution of 1988, all &quot;municípios&quot; are members of the federation. Colloquially, the local population uses the terms &quot;municipality&quot; and &quot;city&quot; interchangeably, although the constitution defines &quot;city&quot; as the seat of the municipality.

=== Commune ===
In many countries, terms cognate with &quot;commune&quot; are used, referring to the community living in the area and the common interest. These include terms:

* in Romance languages, such as French &#x27; (France, French-speaking areas of Belgium and Switzerland, French-speaking countries of Africa, e.g. Benin), Italian &#x27; (Italy), Portuguese &#x27; (Angola), Romanian &#x27; (Romania), and Spanish &quot; (Chile);
* in Germanic languages such as German &#x27; (in political parlance), Swedish &#x27; (Sweden), Faroese &#x27; (Faroe Islands), Norwegian, Danish &#x27; (Norway, Denmark);
* the more remote cognates &#x27; in Dutch (Netherlands, Dutch-speaking areas of Belgium), &#x27; in Luxembourgish (Luxembourg) and &quot; in German (the official term; Germany);
* Finnish &quot; (Finland).
* Ukrainian &quot;. 
* and Polish &quot;&quot;. 
The same terms &quot;Gemeente&quot; (Dutch) or &quot;Gemeinde&quot; (German) may be used for church congregations or parishes, for example, in the German and Dutch Protestant churches.

=== Other terms ===
In Greece, the word () is used, also meaning &#x27;community&#x27;; the word is known in English from the compound &quot;democracy&quot; (rule of the people).

In some countries, the Spanish term &quot;&quot;, referring to a municipality&#x27;s administration building, is extended via synecdoche to denote the municipality itself. In Moldova and Romania, both &quot;municipalities&quot; (&quot;municipiu&quot;; urban administrative units) and &quot;communes&quot; (; rural units) exist, and a commune may be part of a municipality.

In many countries, comparable entities may exist with various names.

=== English-speaking ===
*In Australia, the term local government area (LGA) is used in place of the generic municipality. Here, the &quot;LGA Structure covers only incorporated areas of Australia. Incorporated areas are legally designated parts of states and territories over which incorporated local governing bodies have responsibility.&quot;
*In Canada, municipalities are local governments established through provincial and territorial legislation, usually within general municipal statutes. Types of municipalities within Canada include cities, district municipalities, municipal districts, municipalities, parishes, rural municipalities, towns, townships, villages, and villes among others. The province of Ontario has different tiers of municipalities, including lower, upper, and single tiers. Types of upper tier municipalities in Ontario include counties and regional municipalities. Nova Scotia also has regional municipalities, which include cities, counties, districts, or towns as municipal units.
*In India, a municipality (also known as &quot;municipal council&quot;) is an urban local body that administers a city of population 100,000 or more (the criteria varies from state to state). However, there are exceptions to that, as previously municipalities were constituted in urban centers with population over 20,000, so all the urban bodies which were previously classified as municipality were reclassified as municipality even if their population was under 100,000. it interacts directly with the state government, though it is administratively part of the district it is located in. Generally, smaller district cities and bigger towns have a municipality. Municipalities are also a form of local self-government entrusted with some duties and responsibilities, as enshrined in the Constitutional (74th Amendment) Act,1992.
*In the United Kingdom, the term was used until the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect in 1974 in England and Wales, and until 1975 in Scotland and 1976 in Northern Ireland, &quot;both for a city or town which is organized for self-government under a municipal corporation, and also for the governing body itself. Such a corporation in Great Britain consists of a head as a mayor or provost, and of superior members, as aldermen and councillors&quot;. Since local government reorganisation, the unit in England, Northern Ireland and Wales is known as a &quot;district&quot;, and in Scotland as a &quot;council area&quot;. A &quot;district&quot; may be awarded &quot;borough&quot; or &quot;city&quot; status, or can retain its &quot;district&quot; title.
*In Jersey, a municipality refers to the honorary officials elected to run each of the 12 parishes into which it is subdivided. This is the highest level of regional government in this jurisdiction.
* In Trinidad and Tobago, &quot;municipality&quot; is usually understood as a city, town, or other local government unit, formed by municipal charter from the state as a municipal corporation. A town may be awarded borough status and, later on, may be upgraded to city status. Chaguanas, San Fernando, Port of Spain, Arima and Point Fortin are the 5 current municipalities in Trinidad and Tobago.
*In the United States, &quot;municipality&quot; is usually understood as a city, town, village, or other local government unit, formed by municipal charter from the state as a municipal corporation. In a state law context, some U.S. state codes define &quot;municipality&quot; more widely, from the state itself to any political subdivisions given jurisdiction over an area that may include multiple populated places and unpopulated places (see also: Local government in the United States#Municipal governments).

=== Chinese-speaking ===
*In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a direct-administered municipality (直辖市 in pinyin: zhíxiáshì) is a municipality with equal status to a province: Beijing Municipality, Chongqing Municipality, Shanghai Municipality, and Tianjin Municipality (see also: Direct-administered municipalities of China).
*In the Republic of China (Taiwan), a special municipality (直轄市 in pinyin: zhíxiáshì) is a municipality with equal status to a province: Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, and Taoyuan (see also: Special municipality (Taiwan)).

== Municipalities by country ==
*In Portuguese language usage, there are two words to distinguish the territory and the administrative organ. When referring to the territory, the word concelho is used, when referring to the organ of State, the word município is used. This differentiation is in use in Portugal and some of its former overseas provinces, but it is no longer in use in Brazil, where município refers to the territorial boundaries and prefeitura is its administrative organ.

<doc id="19041" wikidata="Q1347312" url="?curid=19041" title="Marley Marl">
<text>Marlon Lu&#x27;Ree Williams (born September 30, 1962), better known by his stage name Marley Marl, is an American DJ, record producer, rapper and record label founder, primarily operating in hip hop music. Marlon grew up in Queensbridge housing projects located in Queens, New York. He performed in local talent shows during the early days of rap music, further fueling his interest.

He was also featured on Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s &quot;Paid in Full&quot; from their debut album, which was also recorded in his studio. 
He is credited with influencing a number of hip hop icons such as Biggie Smalls, RZA, DJ Premier, Madlib, and Pete Rock. Producer Madlib stated in an interview that Marley was the first producer who inspired him to make beats. &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine wrote that he, &quot;forever changed the sound of hip-hop with his unique beat barrages.&quot;

== Early career ==
Marley&#x27;s career started with an interest in electronica. As a young intern at Unique Recording Studios in the early 1980s, he had an opportunity to experiment with very expensive samplers like the Fairlight CMI. One day during a studio session with an artist named Captain Rock he discovered sampling by accident. &quot;I was actually trying to get a riff off of a record. I made a mistake and got the snare in there before the sound came. I was truncating the vocal part but the snare was playing with the beat — we was truncating while the beat was playing. Thank God the beat was playing, because it probably wouldn&#x27;t have happened if the beat wasn&#x27;t playing. So I was playing it and the snare sounded better than the snare that I had from the drum machine when I was popping it.&quot;A short time later pioneering hip-hop radio DJ Mr. Magic heard Marley Marl&#x27;s remix of Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s Buffalo Gals, leading to Marley becoming his DJ. They eventually started the hip-hop collective the Juice Crew together in 1983. 1986 saw the foundation of Cold Chillin&#x27; Records, where Marley served as in-house producer for many projects. He earned $250,000 per year for his production work. The label was also home to many Juice Crew artists.

Marley caught his big break in 1984, with artist Roxanne Shante&#x27;s hit &quot;Roxanne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. In a 2008 interview Shante noted how seriously he took recording despite his limited setup. &quot;We&#x27;d be recording in his living room on a reel-to-reel and four-tracks. I really just wanted to go to the mall after one take, but Marley always made me do it again.&quot;

Another significant early record was 1985&#x27;s &quot;Marley Marl Scratch&quot; featuring MC Shan. The song was recorded on a four-track cassette recorder and Shan used a mic with a missing ball to record his lyrics.

Several of his early records featured inventive use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine. On MC Shan&#x27;s 1986 Pop Art single &quot;The Bridge&#x27;, which later appeared on his 1987 album &quot;Down By Law&quot;, Marley used the 808 pulse to trigger different samplers. According to Biz Markie, the button on Marley&#x27;s 808 stuck during the recording of his hit &quot;Make the Music with Your Mouth, Biz&quot;, leading to sound heard on the record today. Juice Crew member Big Daddy Kane praised his ability to pair 808 drum sounds with sampled drums. &quot;Regardless of how clean or brand-new the record was that he was sampling, or light the production may have been, he always gave it a really gritty feel when he sampled it. He always put the 808 to it and gave it a heavy bottom and warm feel.&quot;

In the late 1980s, the Juice Crew gained increased attention from mainstream publications. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;they&#x27;ve produced some of the genre&#x27;s toughest, most uncompromising music.&quot; At the time Marley began a streak of producing entire albums for several Juice Crew members. He produced all of the tracks on Craig G&#x27;s &quot;The Kingpin&quot; (1989), Big Daddy Kane&#x27;s &quot;Long Live The Kane&quot; (1988)&quot;,&quot; Biz Markie&#x27;s &quot;Goin&#x27; Off&quot; (1988), Kool G Rap &amp; DJ Polo&#x27;s &quot;Road to the Riches&quot; (1989), MC Shan&#x27;s &quot;Down By Law&quot; (1987) and &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; (1988), and Roxanne Shante&#x27;s &quot;Bad Sister&quot; (1989).

In 1988, he produced the Juice Crew posse cut &quot;The Symphony&quot; by using a Hal Jackson record from the WBLS record library as a sample source.

== Post-Juice Crew and Cold Chillin&#x27; ==
In 1996, Marley filed a suit against Cold Chillin&#x27; for unpaid royalties.

In 2007 he produced the entire &quot;Hip Hop Lives&quot; album for former rival KRS-One.

<text>A metal () is a material that, when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. These properties are all associated with having electrons available at the Fermi level, as against nonmetallic materials which do not. Metals are typically ductile (can be drawn into wires) and malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets).

A metal may be a chemical element such as iron; an alloy such as stainless steel; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride. The general science of metals is called metallurgy, a subtopic of materials science; aspects of the electronic and thermal properties are also within the scope of condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry, it is a multidisciplinary topic. In colloquial use materials such as steel alloys are referred to as metals, while others such as polymers, wood or ceramics are nonmetallic materials.

A metal conducts electricity at a temperature of absolute zero, which is a consequence of delocalized states at the Fermi energy. Many elements and compounds become metallic under high pressures, for example, iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure. Sodium becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure, and at even higher pressures it is expected to become a metal again.

When discussing the periodic table and some chemical properties the term metal is often used to denote those elements which in pure form and at standard conditions are metals in the sense of electrical conduction mentioned above. The related term metallic may also be used for types of dopant atoms or alloying elements.

In astronomy metal refers to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than helium. In this sense the first four &quot;metals&quot; collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime. The metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.

The strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks. Precious metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements. There is also extensive use of multi-element metals such as titanium nitride or degenerate semiconductors in the semiconductor industry.

The history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago. Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the fifth millennium BCE. Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; the discovery of sodium—the first light metal—in 1809; the rise of modern alloy steels; and, since the end of World War II, the development of more sophisticated alloys.

==Properties==

===Form and structure===

Most metals are shiny and lustrous, at least when polished, or fractured. Sheets of metal thicker than a few micrometres appear opaque, but gold leaf transmits green light. This is due to the freely moving electrons which reflect light.

Although most elemental metals have higher densities than nonmetals, there is a wide variation in their densities, lithium being the least dense (0.534 g/cm3) and osmium (22.59 g/cm3) the most dense. Some of the 6d transition metals are expected to be denser than osmium, but their known isotopes are too unstable for bulk production to be possible Magnesium, aluminium and titanium are light metals of significant commercial importance. Their respective densities of 1.7, 2.7, and 4.5 g/cm3 can be compared to those of the older structural metals, like iron at 7.9 and copper at 8.9 g/cm3. The most common lightweight metals are aluminium and magnesium alloys.

Metals are typically malleable and ductile, deforming under stress without cleaving. The nondirectional nature of metallic bonding contributes to the ductility of most metallic solids, where the Peierls stress is relatively low allowing for dislocation motion, and there are also many combinations of planes and directions for plastic deformation. Due to their having close packed arrangements of atoms the Burgers vector of the dislocations are fairly small, which also means that the energy needed to produce one is small. In contrast, in an ionic compound like table salt the Burgers vectors are much larger and the energy to move a dislocation is far higher. Reversible elastic deformation in metals can be described well by Hooke&#x27;s Law for the restoring forces, where the stress is linearly proportional to the strain.

A temperature change may lead to the movement of structural defects in the metal such as grain boundaries, point vacancies, line and screw dislocations, stacking faults and twins in both crystalline and non-crystalline metals. Internal slip, creep, and metal fatigue may also ensue.

The atoms of simple metallic substances are often in one of three common crystal structures, namely body-centered cubic (bcc), face-centered cubic (fcc), and hexagonal close-packed (hcp). In bcc, each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others. In fcc and hcp, each atom is surrounded by twelve others, but the stacking of the layers differs. Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature.
Many other metals with different elements have more complicated structures, such as rock-salt structure in titanium nitride or perovskite (structure) in some nickelates.

===Electrical and thermal===
The electronic structure of metals means they are relatively good conductors of electricity. The electrons all have different momenta, which average to zero when there is no external voltage. When a voltage is applied some move a little faster in a given direction, some a little slower so there is a net drift velocity which leads to an electric current. This involves small changes in which wavefunctions the electrons are in, changing to those with the higher momenta. Quantum mechanics dictates that one can only have one electron in a given state, the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore there have to be empty delocalized electron states (with the higher momenta) available at the highest occupied energies as sketched in the Figure. In a semiconductor like silicon or a nonmetal like strontium titanate there is an energy gap between the highest filled states of the electrons and the lowest unfilled, so no accessible states with slightly higher momenta. Consequently, semiconductors and nonmetals are poor conductors, although they can carry some current when doped with elements that introduce additional partially occupied energy states at higher temperatures.

The elemental metals have electrical conductivity values of from 6.9 × 103 S/cm for manganese to 6.3 × 105 S/cm for silver. In contrast, a semiconducting metalloid such as boron has an electrical conductivity 1.5 × 10−6 S/cm. With one exception, metallic elements reduce their electrical conductivity when heated. Plutonium increases its electrical conductivity when heated in the temperature range of around −175 to +125 °C, with anomalously large thermal expansion coefficient and a phase change from monoclinic to face-centered cubic near 100  °C. There is evidence that this and comparable behavior in transuranic elements is due to more complex relativistic and spin interactions which are not captured in simple models.

All of the metallic alloys as well as conducting ceramics and polymers are metals by the same definition; for instance titanium nitride has delocalized states at the Fermi level. They have electrical conductivities similar to those of elemental metals. Liquid forms are also metallic conductors or electricity, for instance mercury. In normal conditions no gases are metallic conductors. However, a plasma (physics) is a metallic conductor and the charged particles in a plasma have many properties in common with those of electrons in elemental metals, particularly for white dwarf stars.

Metals are relatively good conductors of heat, which in metals is transported mainly by the conduction electrons. At higher temperatures the electrons can occupy slightly higher energy levels given by Fermi–Dirac statistics. These have slightly higher momenta (kinetic energy) and can pass on thermal energy. The empirical Wiedemann–Franz law states that in many metals the ratio between thermal and electrical conductivities is proportional to temperature, with a proportionality constant that is roughly the same for all metals.

The contribution of a metal&#x27;s electrons to its heat capacity and thermal conductivity, and the electrical conductivity of the metal itself can be approximately calculated from the free electron model. However, this does not take into account the detailed structure of the metal&#x27;s ion lattice. Taking into account the positive potential caused by the arrangement of the ion cores enables consideration of the electronic band structure and binding energy of a metal. Various models are applicable, the simplest being the nearly free electron model. Modern methods such as density functional theory are typically used.

===Chemical===
The elements which form metals usually form cations through electron loss. Most will react with oxygen in the air to form oxides over various timescales (potassium burns in seconds while iron rusts over years) which depend upon whether the native oxide forms a passivation layer that acts as a diffusion barrier. Some others, like palladium, platinum, and gold, do not react with the atmosphere at all; gold can form compounds where it gains an electron (aurides, e.g. caesium auride). The oxides of elemental metals are often basic. However, oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO3, Mn2O7, and OsO4 often have strictly acidic reactions; and oxides of the less electropositive metals such as BeO, Al2O3, and PbO, can display both basic and acidic properties. The latter are termed amphoteric oxides.

==Periodic table distribution of elemental metals==

The elements that form exclusively metallic structures under ordinary conditions are shown in yellow on the periodic table below. The remaining elements either form covalent network structures (light blue), molecular covalent structures (dark blue), or remain as single atoms (violet). Astatine (At), francium (Fr), and the elements from fermium (Fm) onwards are shown in gray because they are extremely radioactive and have never been produced in bulk. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that these uninvestigated elements should be metals, except for oganesson (Og) which DFT calculations indicate would be a semiconductor.

The situation changes with pressure: at extremely high pressures, all elements (and indeed all substances) are expected to metallize. Arsenic (As) has both a stable metallic allotrope and a metastable semiconducting allotrope at standard conditions. A similar situation affects carbon (C): graphite is metallic, but diamond is not.

==Alloys==

In the context of metals, an alloy is a substance having metallic properties which is composed of two or more elements. Often at least one of these is a metallic element; the term &quot;alloy&quot; is sometimes used more generally as in silicon–germanium alloys. An alloy may have a variable or fixed composition. For example, gold and silver form an alloy in which the proportions of gold or silver can be varied; titanium and silicon form an alloy TiSi2 in which the ratio of the two components is fixed (also known as an intermetallic compound).
Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle, or chemically reactive for practical use. Combining different ratios of metals and other elements in alloys modifies the properties to produce desirable characteristics, for instance more ductile, harder, resistant to corrosion, or have a more desirable color and luster. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steel) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low-, mid-, and high-carbon steels, with increasing carbon levels reducing ductility and toughness. The addition of silicon will produce cast irons, while the addition of chromium, nickel, and molybdenum to carbon steels (more than 10%) results in stainless steels with enhanced corrosion resistance.

Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminum, titanium, copper, and magnesium. Copper alloys have been known since prehistory—bronze gave the Bronze Age its name—and have many applications today, most importantly in electrical wiring. The alloys of the other three metals have been developed relatively recently; due to their chemical reactivity they need electrolytic extraction processes. The alloys of aluminum, titanium, and magnesium are valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios; magnesium can also provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratio is more important than material cost, such as in aerospace and some automotive applications.

Alloys specially designed for highly demanding applications, such as jet engines, may contain more than ten elements.

==Categories==
Metals can be categorised by their composition, physical or chemical properties. Categories described in the subsections below include ferrous and non-ferrous metals; brittle metals and refractory metals; white metals; heavy and light metals; base, noble, and precious metals as well as both metallic ceramics and polymers.

===Ferrous and non-ferrous metals===

The term &quot;ferrous&quot; is derived from the Latin word meaning &quot;containing iron&quot;. This can include pure iron, such as wrought iron, or an alloy such as steel. Ferrous metals are often magnetic, but not exclusively. Non-ferrous metals and alloys lack appreciable amounts of iron.

===Brittle elemental metal===
While nearly all elemental metals are malleable or ductile, a few—beryllium, chromium, manganese, gallium, and bismuth—are brittle. Arsenic and antimony, if admitted as metals, are brittle. Low values of the ratio of bulk elastic modulus to shear modulus (Pugh&#x27;s criterion) are indicative of intrinsic brittleness. A material is brittle if it is hard for dislocations to move, which is often associated with large Burgers vectors and only a limited number of slip planes.

===Refractory metal===

A refractory metal is a metal that is very resistant to heat and wear. Which metals belong to this category varies; the most common definition includes niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium as well as their alloys. They all have melting points above 2000 °C, and a high hardness at room temperature. Several compounds such as titanium nitride are also described as refractory metals.
===White metal===

A white metal is any of a range of white-colored alloys with relatively low melting points used mainly for decorative purposes. In Britain, the fine art trade uses the term &quot;white metal&quot; in auction catalogues to describe foreign silver items which do not carry British Assay Office marks, but which are nonetheless understood to be silver and are priced accordingly.

===Heavy and light metals===

A heavy metal is any relatively dense metal, either single element or multielement. Magnesium, aluminium and titanium alloys are light metals of significant commercial importance. Their densities of 1.7, 2.7 and 4.5 g/cm3 range from 19 to 56% of the densities of other structural metals, such as iron (7.9) and copper (8.9) and their alloys.

===Base, noble, and precious metals===

The term &quot;base metal&quot; refers to a metal that is easily oxidized or corroded, such as reacting easily with dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form a metal chloride and hydrogen. The term is normally used for the elements, and examples include iron, nickel, lead, and zinc. Copper is considered a base metal as it is oxidized relatively easily, although it does not react with HCl.
The term noble metal (also for elements) is commonly used in opposition to &quot;base metal&quot;. Noble metals are less reactive, resistant to corrosion or oxidation, unlike most base metals. They tend to be precious metals, often due to perceived rarity. Examples include gold, platinum, silver, rhodium, iridium, and palladium.

In alchemy and numismatics, the term base metal is contrasted with precious metal, that is, those of high economic value. Most coins today are made of base metals with low intrinsic value; in the past, coins frequently derived their value primarily from their precious metal content; gold, silver, platinum, and palladium each have an ISO 4217 currency code. Currently they have industrial uses such as platinum and palladium in catalytic converters, are used in jewellery and also a role as investments and a store of value. Palladium and platinum, as of summer 2024, were valued at slightly less than half the price of gold, while silver is substantially less expensive.

===Valve metals===

In electrochemistry, a valve metal is a metal which passes current in only one direction due to the formation of any insulating oxide later.

=== Metallic ceramics ===

There are many ceramic compounds which have metallic electrical conduction, but are not simple combinations of metallic elements. (They are not the same as cermets which are composites of a non-conducting ceramic and a conducting metal.) One set, the transition metal nitrides has significant ionic character to the bonding, so can be classified as both ceramics and metals. They have partially filled states at the Fermi level so are good thermal and electrical conductors, and there is often significant charge transfer from the transition metal atoms to the nitrogen. However, unlike most elemental metals, ceramic metals are often not particularly ductile. Their uses are widespread, for instance titanium nitride finds use in orthopedic devices and as a wear resistant coating. In many cases their utility depends upon there being effective deposition methods so they can be used as thin film coatings.

=== Metallic polymers ===
There are many polymers which have metallic electrical conduction, typically associated with extended aromatic components such as in the polymers indicated in the Figure. The conduction of the aromatic regions is similar to that of graphite, so is highly directional.

=== Half metal ===

A half-metal is any substance that acts as a conductor to electrons of one spin orientation, but as an insulator or semiconductor to those of the opposite spin. They were first described in 1983, as an explanation for the electrical properties of manganese-based Heusler alloys. Although all half-metals are ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic), most ferromagnets are not half-metals. Many of the known examples of half-metals are oxides, sulfides, or Heusler alloys.

=== Semimetal ===

A semimetal is a material with a small energy overlap between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band, but they do not overlap in momentum space. Unlike a regular metal, semimetals have charge carriers of both types (holes and electrons), although the charge carriers typically occur in much smaller numbers than in a real metal. In this respect they resemble degenerate semiconductors. This explains why the electrical properties of semimetals are partway between those of metals and semiconductors. There are additional types, in particular Weyl and Dirac semimetals.

The classic elemental semimetallic elements are arsenic, antimony, bismuth, α-tin (gray tin) and graphite. There are also chemical compounds, such as mercury telluride (HgTe), and some conductive polymers.

==Lifecycle==
===Formation===

Metallic elements up to the vicinity of iron (in the periodic table) are largely made via stellar nucleosynthesis. In this process, lighter elements from hydrogen to silicon undergo successive fusion reactions inside stars, releasing light and heat and forming heavier elements with higher atomic numbers.

Heavier elements are not usually formed this way since fusion reactions involving such nuclei would consume rather than release energy. Rather, they are largely synthesised (from elements with a lower atomic number) by neutron capture, with the two main modes of this repetitive capture being the s-process and the r-process. In the s-process (&quot;s&quot; stands for &quot;slow&quot;), singular captures are separated by years or decades, allowing the less stable nuclei to beta decay, while in the r-process (&quot;rapid&quot;), captures happen faster than nuclei can decay. Therefore, the s-process takes a more-or-less clear path: for example, stable cadmium-110 nuclei are successively bombarded by free neutrons inside a star until they form cadmium-115 nuclei which are unstable and decay to form indium-115 (which is nearly stable, with a half-life times the age of the universe). These nuclei capture neutrons and form indium-116, which is unstable, and decays to form tin-116, and so on. In contrast, there is no such path in the r-process. The s-process stops at bismuth due to the short half-lives of the next two elements, polonium and astatine, which decay to bismuth or lead. The r-process is so fast it can skip this zone of instability and go on to create heavier elements such as thorium and uranium.

Metals condense in planets as a result of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter as a result of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed.

===Abundance and occurrence===
The Earth&#x27;s crust is made of approximately 25% of metallic elements by weight, of which 80% are light metals such as sodium, magnesium, and aluminium. Despite the overall scarcity of some heavier metals such as copper, they can become concentrated in economically extractable quantities as a result of mountain building, erosion, or other geological processes.

Metallic elements are primarily found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-loving). Lithophile elements are mainly the s-block elements, the more reactive of the d-block elements, and the f-block elements. They have a strong affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low-density silicate minerals. Chalcophile elements are mainly the less reactive d-block elements, and the period 4–6 p-block metals. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust at the time of its solidification, the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles.

On the other hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form compounds with either oxygen or sulfur. At the time of the Earth&#x27;s formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metallic elements, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is relatively rare. Some other (less) noble ones—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle, and crust), rather the crust. These otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).

The rotating fluid outer core of the Earth&#x27;s interior, which is composed mostly of iron, is thought to be the source of Earth&#x27;s protective magnetic field. The core lies above Earth&#x27;s solid inner core and below its mantle. If it could be rearranged into a column having a footprint it would have a height of nearly 700 light years. The magnetic field shields the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind, and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere (including the ozone layer that limits the transmission of ultraviolet radiation).

===Extraction===

Metallic elements are often extracted from the Earth by mining ores that are rich sources of the requisite elements, such as bauxite. Ores are located by prospecting techniques, followed by the exploration and examination of deposits. Mineral sources are generally divided into surface mines, which are mined by excavation using heavy equipment, and subsurface mines. In some cases, the sale price of the metal(s) involved make it economically feasible to mine lower concentration sources.

Once the ore is mined, the elements must be extracted, usually by chemical or electrolytic reduction. Pyrometallurgy uses high temperatures to convert ore into raw metals, while hydrometallurgy employs aqueous chemistry for the same purpose.

When a metallic ore is an ionic compound, the ore must usually be smelted—heated with a reducing agent—to extract the pure metal. Many common metals, such as iron, are smelted using carbon as a reducing agent. Some metals, such as aluminum and sodium, have no commercially practical reducing agent, and are extracted using electrolysis instead.

Sulfide ores are not reduced directly to the metal but are roasted in air to convert them to oxides.

===Recycling===

Demand for metals is closely linked to economic growth given their use in infrastructure, construction, manufacturing, and consumer goods. During the 20th century, the variety of metals used in society grew rapidly. Today, the development of major nations, such as China and India, and technological advances, are fueling ever more demand. The result is that mining activities are expanding, and more and more of the world&#x27;s metal stocks are above ground in use, rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in-use stock of copper. Between 1932 and 1999, copper in use in the U.S. rose from 73 g to 238 g per person.

Metals are inherently recyclable, so in principle, can be used over and over again, minimizing these negative environmental impacts and saving energy. For example, 95% of the energy used to make aluminum from bauxite ore is saved by using recycled material.

Globally, metal recycling is generally low. In 2010, the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme published reports on metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling rates. The authors of the report observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground. They warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Copper, which occurs in native form, may have been the first metal discovered given its distinctive appearance, heaviness, and malleability. Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), and lead were likewise discovered in prehistory. Forms of brass, an alloy of copper and zinc made by concurrently smelting the ores of these metals, originate from this period (although pure zinc was not isolated until the 13th century). The malleability of the solid metals led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons. Meteoric iron containing nickel was discovered from time to time and, in some respects this was superior to any industrial steel manufactured up to the 1880s when alloy steels become prominent.

===Antiquity===
The discovery of bronze (an alloy of copper with arsenic or tin) enabled people to create metal objects which were harder and more durable than previously possible. Bronze tools, weapons, armor, and building materials such as decorative tiles were harder and more durable than their stone and copper (&quot;Chalcolithic&quot;) predecessors. Initially, bronze was made of copper and arsenic (forming arsenic bronze) by smelting naturally or artificially mixed ores of copper and arsenic. The earliest artifacts so far known come from the Iranian plateau in the fifth millennium BCE. It was only later that tin was used, becoming the major non-copper ingredient of bronze in the late third millennium BCE. Pure tin itself was first isolated in 1800 BCE by Chinese and Japanese metalworkers.

Mercury was known to ancient Chinese and Indians before 2000 BCE, and found in Egyptian tombs dating from 1500 BCE.

The earliest known production of steel, an iron-carbon alloy, is seen in pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehöyük) which are nearly 4,000 years old, dating from 1800 BCE.

From about 500 BCE sword-makers of Toledo, Spain, were making early forms of alloy steel by adding a mineral called wolframite, which contained tungsten and manganese, to iron ore (and carbon). The resulting Toledo steel came to the attention of Rome when used by Hannibal in the Punic Wars. It soon became the basis for the weaponry of Roman legions; such swords were, &quot;stronger in composition than any existing sword and, because… [they] would not break, provided a psychological advantage to the Roman soldier.&quot;

In pre-Columbian America, objects made of tumbaga, an alloy of copper and gold, started being produced in Panama and Costa Rica between 300 and 500 CE. Small metal sculptures were common and an extensive range of tumbaga (and gold) ornaments comprised the usual regalia of persons of high status.

At around the same time indigenous Ecuadorians were combining gold with a naturally-occurring platinum alloy containing small amounts of palladium, rhodium, and iridium, to produce miniatures and masks of a white gold-platinum alloy. The metal workers involved heated gold with grains of the platinum alloy until the gold melted. After cooling, the resulting conglomeration was hammered and reheated repeatedly until it became homogenous, equivalent to melting all the metals (attaining the melting points of the platinum group metals concerned was beyond the technology of the day).

===Middle Ages===

Arabic and medieval alchemists believed that all metals and matter were composed of the principle of sulfur, the father of all metals and carrying the combustible property, and the principle of mercury, the mother of all metals and carrier of the liquidity, fusibility, and volatility properties. These principles were not necessarily the common substances sulfur and mercury found in most laboratories. This theory reinforced the belief that all metals were destined to become gold in the bowels of the earth through the proper combinations of heat, digestion, time, and elimination of contaminants, all of which could be developed and hastened through the knowledge and methods of alchemy.

Arsenic, zinc, antimony, and bismuth became known, although these were at first called semimetals or bastard metals on account of their immalleability. Albertus Magnus is believed to have been the first to isolate arsenic from a compound in 1250, by heating soap together with arsenic trisulfide. Metallic zinc, which is brittle if impure, was isolated in India by 1300 AD. The first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the 1540 book &quot;De la pirotechnia&quot; by Vannoccio Biringuccio. Bismuth was described by Agricola in &quot;De Natura Fossilium&quot; (c. 1546); it had been confused in early times with tin and lead because of its resemblance to those elements.

===The Renaissance===

The first systematic text on the arts of mining and metallurgy was &quot;De la Pirotechnia&quot; (1540) by Vannoccio Biringuccio, which treats the examination, fusion, and working of metals.

Sixteen years later, Georgius Agricola published &quot;De Re Metallica&quot; in 1556, an account of the profession of mining, metallurgy, and the accessory arts and sciences, an extensive treatise on the chemical industry through the sixteenth century.

He gave the following description of a metal in his &quot;De Natura Fossilium&quot; (1546):

Metal is a mineral body, by nature either liquid or somewhat hard. The latter may be melted by the heat of the fire, but when it has cooled down again and lost all heat, it becomes hard again and resumes its proper form. In this respect it differs from the stone which melts in the fire, for although the latter regain its hardness, yet it loses its pristine form and properties.

Traditionally there are six different kinds of metals, namely gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead. There are really others, for quicksilver is a metal, although the Alchemists disagree with us on this subject, and bismuth is also. The ancient Greek writers seem to have been ignorant of bismuth, wherefore Ammonius rightly states that there are many species of metals, animals, and plants which are unknown to us. Stibium when smelted in the crucible and refined has as much right to be regarded as a proper metal as is accorded to lead by writers. If when smelted, a certain portion be added to tin, a bookseller&#x27;s alloy is produced from which the type is made that is used by those who print books on paper.

Each metal has its own form which it preserves when separated from those metals which were mixed with it. Therefore neither electrum nor Stannum [not meaning our tin] is of itself a real metal, but rather an alloy of two metals. Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver, Stannum of lead and silver. And yet if silver be parted from the electrum, then gold remains and not electrum; if silver be taken away from Stannum, then lead remains and not Stannum.

Whether brass, however, is found as a native metal or not, cannot be ascertained with any surety. We only know of the artificial brass, which consists of copper tinted with the colour of the mineral calamine. And yet if any should be dug up, it would be a proper metal. Black and white copper seem to be different from the red kind.

Metal, therefore, is by nature either solid, as I have stated, or fluid, as in the unique case of quicksilver.

But enough now concerning the simple kinds.

Platinum, the third precious metal after gold and silver, was discovered in Ecuador during the period 1736 to 1744 by the Spanish astronomer Antonio de Ulloa and his colleague the mathematician Jorge Juan y Santacilia. Ulloa was the first person to write a scientific description of the metal, in 1748.

In 1789, the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth isolated an oxide of uranium, which he thought was the metal itself. Klaproth was subsequently credited as the discoverer of uranium. It was not until 1841, that the French chemist Eugène-Melchior Péligot, prepared the first sample of uranium metal. Henri Becquerel subsequently discovered radioactivity in 1896 using uranium.

In the 1790s, Joseph Priestley and the Dutch chemist Martinus van Marum observed the effect of metal surfaces on the dehydrogenation of alcohol, a development which subsequently led, in 1831, to the industrial scale synthesis of sulphuric acid using a platinum catalyst.

In 1803, cerium was the first of the lanthanide metals to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. The lanthanide metals were regarded as oddities until the 1960s when methods were developed to more efficiently separate them from one another. They have subsequently found uses in cell phones, magnets, lasers, lighting, batteries, catalytic converters, and in other applications enabling modern technologies.

Other metals discovered and prepared during this time were cobalt, nickel, manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, and chromium; and some of the platinum group metals, palladium, osmium, iridium, and rhodium.

===Light metallic elements===
All elemental metals discovered before 1809 had relatively high densities; their heaviness was regarded as a distinguishing criterion. From 1809 onward, light metals such as sodium, potassium, and strontium were isolated. Their low densities challenged conventional wisdom as to the nature of metals. They behaved chemically as metals however, and were subsequently recognized as such.

Aluminium was discovered in 1824 but it was not until 1886 that an industrial large-scale production method was developed. Prices of aluminium dropped and aluminium became widely used in jewelry, everyday items, eyeglass frames, optical instruments, tableware, and foil in the 1890s and early 20th century. Aluminium&#x27;s ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses at the time. During World War I, major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light and strong airframes.

While pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 it was not used outside the laboratory until 1932. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications as part of programs related to the Cold War. Starting in the early 1950s, titanium came into use in military aviation, particularly in high-performance jets, starting with aircraft such as the F-100 Super Sabre and Lockheed A-12 and SR-71.

Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of aluminium-scandium alloys began in 1971 following a U.S. patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.
===The age of steel===
The modern era in steelmaking began with the introduction of Henry Bessemer&#x27;s Bessemer process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or &quot;basic Bessemer process&quot;) was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.

Due to its high tensile strength and low cost, steel came to be a major component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.

In 1872, the Englishmen Clark and Woods patented an alloy that would today be considered a stainless steel. The corrosion resistance of iron-chromium alloys had been recognized in 1821 by French metallurgist Pierre Berthier. He noted their resistance against attack by some acids and suggested their use in cutlery. Metallurgists of the 19th century were unable to produce the combination of low carbon and high chromium found in most modern stainless steels, and the high-chromium alloys they could produce were too brittle to be practical. It was not until 1912 that the industrialization of stainless steel alloys occurred in England, Germany, and the United States.

===The last stable metallic elements===
By 1900 three metals with atomic numbers less than lead (#82), the heaviest stable metal, remained to be discovered: elements 71, 72, 75.

Von Welsbach, in 1906, proved that the old ytterbium also contained a new element (#71), which he named &quot;cassiopeium&quot;. Urbain proved this simultaneously, but his samples were very impure and only contained trace quantities of the new element. Despite this, his chosen name &quot;lutetium&quot; was adopted.

In 1908, Ogawa found element 75 in thorianite but assigned it as element 43 instead of 75 and named it &quot;nipponium&quot;. In 1925 Walter Noddack, Ida Eva Tacke, and Otto Berg announced its separation from gadolinite and gave it the present name, &quot;rhenium&quot;.

Georges Urbain claimed to have found element 72 in rare-earth residues, while Vladimir Vernadsky independently found it in orthite. Neither claim was confirmed due to World War I, and neither could be confirmed later, as the chemistry they reported does not match that now known for &quot;hafnium&quot;. After the war, in 1922, Coster and Hevesy found it by X-ray spectroscopic analysis in Norwegian zircon. Hafnium was thus the last stable element to be discovered, though rhenium was the last to be correctly recognized.

By the end of World War II scientists had synthesized four post-uranium elements, all of which are radioactive (unstable) metals: neptunium (in 1940), plutonium (1940–41), and curium and americium (1944), representing elements 93 to 96. The first two of these were eventually found in nature as well. Curium and americium were by-products of the Manhattan project, which produced the world&#x27;s first atomic bomb in 1945. The bomb was based on the nuclear fission of uranium, a metal first thought to have been discovered nearly 150 years earlier.

===Post-World War II developments===

====Superalloys====

Superalloys composed of combinations of Fe, Ni, Co, and Cr, and lesser amounts of W, Mo, Ta, Nb, Ti, and Al were developed shortly after World War II for use in high performance engines, operating at elevated temperatures (above 650 °C (1,200 °F)). They retain most of their strength under these conditions, for prolonged periods, and combine good low-temperature ductility with resistance to corrosion or oxidation. Superalloys can now be found in a wide range of applications including land, maritime, and aerospace turbines, and chemical and petroleum plants.

====Transcurium metals====
The successful development of the atomic bomb at the end of World War II sparked further efforts to synthesize new elements, nearly all of which are, or are expected to be, metals, and all of which are radioactive. It was not until 1949 that element 97 (Berkelium), next after element 96 (Curium), was synthesized by firing alpha particles at an americium target. In 1952, element 100 (Fermium) was found in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion; hydrogen, a nonmetal, had been identified as an element nearly 200 years earlier. Since 1952, elements 101 (Mendelevium) to 118 (Oganesson) have been synthesized.

====Bulk metallic glasses====

A metallic glass (also known as an amorphous or glassy metal) is a solid metallic material, usually an alloy, with a disordered atomic-scale structure. Most pure and alloyed metals, in their solid state, have atoms arranged in a highly ordered crystalline structure. In contrast these have a non-crystalline glass-like structure. But unlike common glasses, such as window glass, which are typically electrical insulators, amorphous metals have good electrical conductivity. Amorphous metals are produced in several ways, including extremely rapid cooling, physical vapor deposition, solid-state reaction, ion irradiation, and mechanical alloying. The first reported metallic glass was an alloy (Au75Si25) produced at Caltech in 1960. More recently, batches of amorphous steel with three times the strength of conventional steel alloys have been produced. Currently, the most important applications rely on the special magnetic properties of some ferromagnetic metallic glasses. The low magnetization loss is used in high-efficiency transformers. Theft control ID tags and other article surveillance schemes often use metallic glasses because of these magnetic properties.

====Shape-memory alloys====

A shape-memory alloy (SMA) is an alloy that &quot;remembers&quot; its original shape and when deformed returns to its pre-deformed shape when heated. While the shape memory effect had been first observed in 1932, in an Au-Cd alloy, it was not until 1962, with the accidental discovery of the effect in a Ni-Ti alloy that research began in earnest, and another ten years before commercial applications emerged. SMA&#x27;s have applications in robotics and automotive, aerospace, and biomedical industries. There is another type of SMA, called a ferromagnetic shape-memory alloy (FSMA), that changes shape under strong magnetic fields. These materials are of interest as the magnetic response tends to be faster and more efficient than temperature-induced responses.

====Quasicrystalline alloys====
In 1984, Israeli metallurgist Dan Shechtman found an aluminum-manganese alloy having five-fold symmetry, in breach of crystallographic convention at the time which said that crystalline structures could only have two-, three-, four-, or six-fold symmetry. Due to reservation about the scientific community&#x27;s reaction, it took him two years to publish the results  for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011. Since this time, hundreds of quasicrystals have been reported and confirmed. They exist in many metallic alloys (and some polymers). Quasicrystals are found most often in aluminum alloys (Al-Li-Cu, Al-Mn-Si, Al-Ni-Co, Al-Pd-Mn, Al-Cu-Fe, Al-Cu-V, etc.), but numerous other compositions are also known (Cd-Yb, Ti-Zr-Ni, Zn-Mg-Ho, Zn-Mg-Sc, In-Ag-Yb, Pd-U-Si, etc.). Quasicrystals effectively have infinitely large unit cells. Icosahedrite Al63Cu24Fe13, the first quasicrystal found in nature, was discovered in 2009. Most quasicrystals have ceramic-like properties including low electrical conductivity (approaching values seen in insulators) and low thermal conductivity, high hardness, brittleness, and resistance to corrosion, and non-stick properties. Quasicrystals have been used to develop heat insulation, LEDs, diesel engines, and new materials that convert heat to electricity. New applications may take advantage of the low coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials, for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong, hard-wearing, low-friction plastic gears. Other potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion, broad-wavelength reflectors, and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility, low friction, and corrosion resistance are required.

====Complex metallic alloys====

Complex metallic alloys (CMAs) are intermetallic compounds characterized by large unit cells comprising some tens up to thousands of atoms; the presence of well-defined clusters of atoms (frequently with icosahedral symmetry); and partial disorder within their crystalline lattices. They are composed of two or more metallic elements, sometimes with metalloids or chalcogenides added. They include, for example, NaCd2, with 348 sodium atoms and 768 cadmium atoms in the unit cell. Linus Pauling attempted to describe the structure of NaCd2 in 1923, but did not succeed until 1955. At first called &quot;giant unit cell crystals&quot;, interest in CMAs, as they came to be called, did not pick up until 2002, with the publication of a paper called &quot;Structurally Complex Alloy Phases&quot;, given at the &quot;8th International Conference on Quasicrystals.&quot; Potential applications of CMAs include as heat insulation; solar heating; magnetic refrigerators; using waste heat to generate electricity; and coatings for turbine blades in military engines.

====High-entropy alloys====

High entropy alloys (HEAs) such as AlLiMgScTi are composed of equal or nearly equal quantities of five or more metals. Compared to conventional alloys with only one or two base metals, HEAs have considerably better strength-to-weight ratios, higher tensile strength, and greater resistance to fracturing, corrosion, and oxidation. Although HEAs were described as early as 1981, significant interest did not develop until the 2010s; they continue to be a focus of research in materials science and engineering because of their desirable properties.

====MAX phase====
In a Max phase, M is an early transition metal, A is an A group element (mostly group IIIA and IVA, or groups 13 and 14), and X is either carbon or nitrogen. Examples are Hf2SnC and Ti4AlN3. Such alloys have high electrical and thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, damage tolerance, machinability, high elastic stiffness, and low thermal expansion coefficients. They can be polished to a metallic luster because of their excellent electrical conductivities. During mechanical testing, it has been found that polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 cylinders can be repeatedly compressed at room temperature, up to stresses of 1 GPa, and fully recover upon the removal of the load. Some MAX phases are also highly resistant to chemical attack (e.g. Ti3SiC2) and high-temperature oxidation in air (Ti2AlC, Cr2AlC2, and Ti3AlC2). Potential applications for MAX phase alloys include: as tough, machinable, thermal shock-resistant refractories; high-temperature heating elements; coatings for electrical contacts; and neutron irradiation resistant parts for nuclear applications.

<text>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is a standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs. Message bodies may consist of multiple parts, and header information may be specified in non-ASCII character sets. Email messages with MIME formatting are typically transmitted with standard protocols, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the Post Office Protocol (POP), and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).

MIME is an Internet standard. It is specified in a series of requests for comments: ,
,
 and 
. The integration with SMTP email is specified in 
 and 

Although the MIME formalism was designed mainly for SMTP, its content types are also important in other communication protocols. In the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for the World Wide Web, servers insert a MIME header field at the beginning of any Web transmission. Clients use the content type or media type header to select an appropriate viewer application for the type of data indicated.

== History ==

MIME originated from the Andrew Messaging System, which was part of Andrew Project developed at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), as a cross-platform alternative to the Andrew-specific data format.

==MIME header fields==
===MIME-Version===
The presence of this header field indicates the message is MIME-formatted. The value is typically &quot;1.0&quot;. The field appears as follows:
 MIME-Version: 1.0

According to MIME co-creator Nathaniel Borenstein, the version number was introduced to permit changes to the MIME protocol in subsequent versions. However, Borenstein admitted short-comings in the specification that hindered the implementation of this feature: &quot;We did not adequately specify how to handle a future MIME version. ... So if you write something that knows 1.0, what should you do if you encounter 2.0 or 1.1? I sort of thought it was obvious but it turned out everyone implemented that in different ways. And the result is that it would be just about impossible for the Internet to ever define a 2.0 or a 1.1.&quot;

===Content-Type===
This header field indicates the media type of the message content, consisting of a &quot;type&quot; and &quot;subtype&quot;, for example
 Content-Type: text/plain

Through the use of the &quot;multipart&quot; type, MIME allows mail messages to have parts arranged in a tree structure where the leaf nodes are any non-multipart content type and the non-leaf nodes are any of a variety of multipart types.
This mechanism supports (non-exhaustively):
* simple text messages using &quot;text/plain&quot; (the default value for &quot;Content-Type: &quot;)
* text plus attachments (&quot;multipart/mixed&quot; with a &quot;text/plain&quot; part and other non-text parts). A MIME message including an attached file generally indicates the file&#x27;s original name with the &quot;Content-Disposition&quot; header, so that the type of file is indicated both by the MIME content-type and the (usually OS-specific) filename extension
* reply with original attached (&quot;multipart/mixed&quot; with a &quot;text/plain&quot; part and the original message as a &quot;message/rfc822&quot; part)
* alternative content, such as a message sent in both plain text and another format such as HTML (&quot;multipart/alternative&quot; with the same content in &quot;text/plain&quot; and &quot;text/html&quot; forms)
* image, audio, video and application (for example, &quot;image/jpeg&quot;, &quot;audio/mp3&quot;, &quot;video/mp4&quot;, &quot;application/msword&quot;, among others).

===Content-Disposition===
The original MIME specifications only described the structure of mail messages. They did not address the issue of presentation styles. The content-disposition header field was added in RFC 2183 to specify the presentation style. A MIME part can have:
* an &quot;inline&quot; content disposition, which means that it should be automatically displayed when the message is displayed, or
* an &quot;attachment&quot; content disposition, in which case it is not displayed automatically and requires some form of action from the user to open it.
In addition to the presentation style, the field &quot;Content-Disposition&quot; also provides parameters for specifying the name of the file, the creation date and modification date, which can be used by the reader&#x27;s mail user agent to store the attachment.

The following example is taken from RFC 2183, where the header field is defined:
 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=genome.jpeg;
 modification-date=&quot;Wed, 12 Feb 1997 16:29:51 -0500&quot;;

The filename may be encoded as defined in RFC 2231.

As of 2010, a majority of mail user agents did not follow this prescription fully. The widely used Mozilla Thunderbird mail client ignores the &quot;content-disposition&quot; fields in the messages and uses independent algorithms for selecting the MIME parts to display automatically. Thunderbird prior to version 3 also sends out newly composed messages with &quot;inline&quot; content disposition for all MIME parts. Most users are unaware of how to set the content disposition to &quot;attachment&quot;. Many mail user agents also send messages with the file name in the &quot;name&quot; parameter of the &quot;content-type&quot; header instead of the &quot;filename&quot; parameter of the header field &quot;Content-Disposition&quot;. This practice is discouraged, as the file name should be specified either with the parameter &quot;filename&quot;, or with both the parameters &quot;filename&quot; and &quot;name&quot;.

In HTTP, the response header field &quot;Content-Disposition: attachment&quot; is usually used as a hint to the client to present the response body as a downloadable file. Typically, when receiving such a response, a Web browser prompts the user to save its content as a file, instead of displaying it as a page in a browser window, with &quot;filename&quot; suggesting the default file name.

===Content-Transfer-Encoding===
In June 1992, MIME (RFC 1341, since made obsolete by RFC 2045) defined a set of methods for representing binary data in formats other than ASCII text format. The &quot;content-transfer-encoding:&quot; MIME header field has 2-sided significance:
* It indicates whether or not a binary-to-text encoding scheme has been used on top of the original encoding as specified within the Content-Type header:
# If such a binary-to-text encoding method has been used, it states which one.
# If not, it provides a descriptive label for the format of content, with respect to the presence of 8-bit or binary content.

The RFC and the IANA&#x27;s list of transfer encodings define the values shown below, which are not case sensitive. &#x27;7bit&#x27;, &#x27;8bit&#x27;, and &#x27;binary&#x27; mean that no binary-to-text encoding on top of the original encoding was used. In these cases, the header field is actually redundant for the email client to decode the message body, but it may still be useful as an indicator of what type of object is being sent. Values &#x27;quoted-printable&#x27; and &#x27;base64&#x27; tell the email client that a binary-to-text encoding scheme was used and that appropriate initial decoding is necessary before the message can be read with its original encoding (e.g. UTF-8).
* Suitable for use with normal SMTP:
** 7bit – up to 998 octets per line of the code range 1..127 with CR and LF (codes 13 and 10 respectively) only allowed to appear as part of a CRLF line ending. This is the default value.
** quoted-printable – used to encode arbitrary octet sequences into a form that satisfies the rules of 7bit. Designed to be efficient and mostly human-readable when used for text data consisting primarily of US-ASCII characters but also containing a small proportion of bytes with values outside that range.
** base64 – used to encode arbitrary octet sequences into a form that satisfies the rules of 7bit. Designed to be efficient for non-text 8 bit and binary data. Sometimes used for text data that frequently uses non-US-ASCII characters.
* Suitable for use with SMTP servers that support the 8BITMIME SMTP extension (RFC 6152):
**8bit – up to 998 octets per line with CR and LF (codes 13 and 10 respectively) only allowed to appear as part of a CRLF line ending.
* Suitable for use with SMTP servers that support the BINARYMIME SMTP extension (RFC 3030):
** binary – any sequence of octets.

There is no encoding defined which is explicitly designed for sending arbitrary binary data through SMTP transports with the 8BITMIME extension. Thus, if BINARYMIME isn&#x27;t supported, base64 or quoted-printable (with their associated inefficiency) are sometimes still useful. This restriction does not apply to other uses of MIME such as Web Services with MIME attachments or MTOM.

==Encoded-Word==
Since RFC 2822, conforming message header field names and values use ASCII characters; values that contain non-ASCII data should use the MIME encoded-word syntax (RFC 2047) instead of a literal string. This syntax uses a string of ASCII characters indicating both the original character encoding (the &quot;charset&quot;) and the content-transfer-encoding used to map the bytes of the charset into ASCII characters.

The form is: &quot;codice_1&quot;charset&quot;codice_2&quot;encoding&quot;codice_2&quot;encoded text&quot;codice_4&quot;.
* &quot;charset&quot; may be any character set registered with IANA. Typically it would be the same charset as the message body.
* &quot;encoding&quot; can be either &quot;codice_5&quot; denoting Q-encoding that is similar to the quoted-printable encoding, or &quot;codice_6&quot; denoting base64 encoding.
* &quot;encoded text&quot; is the Q-encoded or base64-encoded text.
* An &quot;encoded-word&quot; may not be more than 75 characters long, including &quot;charset&quot;, &quot;encoding&quot;, &quot;encoded text&quot;, and delimiters. If it is desirable to encode more text than will fit in an &quot;encoded-word&quot; of 75 characters, multiple &quot;encoded-word&quot;s (separated by CRLF SPACE) may be used.

===Difference between Q-encoding and quoted-printable===
The ASCII codes for the question mark (&quot;?&quot;) and equals sign (&quot;=&quot;) may not be represented directly as they are used to delimit the encoded word. The ASCII code for space may not be represented directly because it could cause older parsers to split up the encoded word undesirably. To make the encoding smaller and easier to read the underscore is used to represent the ASCII code for space creating the side effect that underscore cannot be represented directly. The use of encoded words in certain parts of header fields imposes further restrictions on which characters may be represented directly.

For example,

codice_7

is interpreted as &quot;Subject: ¡Hola, señor!&quot;.

The encoded-word format is not used for the names of the headers fields (for example &quot;Subject&quot;). These names are usually English terms and always in ASCII in the raw message. When viewing a message with a non-English email client, the header field names might be translated by the client.

==Multipart messages==
The MIME multipart message contains a boundary in the header field ; this boundary, which must not occur in any of the parts, is placed between the parts, and at the beginning and end of the body of the message, as follows:
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=frontier

This is a message with multiple parts in MIME format.
--frontier
Content-Type: text/plain

This is the body of the message.
--frontier
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

PGh0bWw+CiAgPGhlYWQ+CiAgPC9oZWFkPgogIDxib2R5PgogICAgPHA+VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUg
Ym9keSBvZiB0aGUgbWVzc2FnZS48L3A+CiAgPC9ib2R5Pgo8L2h0bWw+Cg==
--frontier--
Each part consists of its own content header (zero or more header fields) and a body. Multipart content can be nested. The of a multipart type must always be &quot;7bit&quot;, &quot;8bit&quot; or &quot;binary&quot; to avoid the complications that would be posed by multiple levels of decoding. The multipart block as a whole does not have a charset; non-ASCII characters in the part headers are handled by the Encoded-Word system, and the part bodies can have charsets specified if appropriate for their content-type.

Notes:
* Before the first boundary is an area that is ignored by MIME-compliant clients. This area is generally used to put a message to users of old non-MIME clients.
* It is up to the sending mail client to choose a boundary string that doesn&#x27;t clash with the body text. Typically this is done by inserting a long random string.
* The last boundary must have two hyphens at the end.

===Multipart subtypes===
The MIME standard defines various multipart-message subtypes, which specify the nature of the message parts and their relationship to one another. The subtype is specified in the header field of the overall message. For example, a multipart MIME message using the digest subtype would have its set as &quot;multipart/digest&quot;.

The RFC initially defined four subtypes: mixed, digest, alternative and parallel. A minimally compliant application must support mixed and digest; other subtypes are optional. Applications must treat unrecognized subtypes as &quot;multipart/mixed&quot;. Additional subtypes, such as signed and form-data, have since been separately defined in other RFCs.

====mixed====
multipart/mixed is used for sending files with different header fields inline (or as attachments). If sending pictures or other easily readable files, most mail clients will display them inline (unless explicitly specified with &quot;Content-Disposition: attachment&quot; in which case offered as attachments). The default content-type for each part is &quot;text/plain&quot;.

The type is defined in RFC 2046.

====digest====
multipart/digest is a simple way to send multiple text messages. The default content-type for each part is &quot;message/rfc822&quot;.

The MIME type is defined in RFC 2046.

====alternative====
The multipart/alternative subtype indicates that each part is an &quot;alternative&quot; version of the same (or similar) content, each in a different format denoted by its &quot;Content-Type&quot; header. The order of the parts is significant. RFC1341 states: &quot;In general, user agents that compose multipart/alternative entities should place the body parts in increasing order of preference, that is, with the preferred format last.&quot;

Systems can then choose the &quot;best&quot; representation they are capable of processing; in general, this will be the last part that the system can understand, although other factors may affect this.

Since a client is unlikely to want to send a version that is less faithful than the plain text version, this structure places the plain text version (if present) first. This makes life easier for users of clients that do not understand multipart messages.

Most commonly, multipart/alternative is used for email with two parts, one plain text (text/plain) and one HTML (text/html). The plain text part provides backwards compatibility while the HTML part allows use of formatting and hyperlinks. Most email clients offer a user option to prefer plain text over HTML; this is an example of how local factors may affect how an application chooses which &quot;best&quot; part of the message to display.

While it is intended that each part of the message represent the same content, the standard does not require this to be enforced in any way. At one time, anti-spam filters would only examine the text/plain part of a message, because it is easier to parse than the text/html part. But spammers eventually took advantage of this, creating messages with an innocuous-looking text/plain part and advertising in the text/html part. Anti-spam software eventually caught up on this trick, penalizing messages with very different text in a multipart/alternative message.

The type is defined in RFC 2046.

====related====
A multipart/related is used to indicate that each message part is a component of an aggregate whole. It is for compound objects consisting of several inter-related components proper display cannot be achieved by individually displaying the constituent parts. The message consists of a root part (by default, the first) which reference other parts inline, which may in turn reference other parts. Message parts are commonly referenced by &quot;Content-ID&quot;. The syntax of a reference is unspecified and is instead dictated by the encoding or protocol used in the part.

One common usage of this subtype is to send a web page complete with images in a single message. The root part would contain the HTML document, and use image tags to reference images stored in the latter parts.

The type is defined in RFC 2387.

====report====
&quot;multipart/report&quot; is a message type that contains data formatted for a mail server to read. It is split between a text/plain (or some other content/type easily readable) and a message/delivery-status, which contains the data formatted for the mail server to read.

The type is defined in RFC 6522.

====signed====
A multipart/signed message is used to attach a digital signature to a message. It has exactly two body parts, a body part and a signature part. The whole of the body part, including mime fields, is used to create the signature part. Many signature types are possible, like &quot;application/pgp-signature&quot; (RFC 3156) and &quot;application/pkcs7-signature&quot; (S/MIME).

The type is defined in RFC 1847.

====encrypted====
A multipart/encrypted message has two parts. The first part has control information that is needed to decrypt the application/octet-stream second part. Similar to signed messages, there are different implementations which are identified by their separate content types for the control part. The most common types are &quot;application/pgp-encrypted&quot; (RFC 3156) and &quot;application/pkcs7-mime&quot; (S/MIME).

The MIME type defined in RFC 1847.

====form-data====
The MIME type &quot;multipart/form-data&quot; is used to express values submitted through a form. Originally defined as part of HTML 4.0, it is most commonly used for submitting files with HTTP. It is specified in RFC 7578, superseding RFC 2388. example

====x-mixed-replace====
The content type multipart/x-mixed-replace was developed as part of a technology to emulate server push and streaming over HTTP.

All parts of a mixed-replace message have the same semantic meaning. However, each part invalidates &quot;replaces&quot; the previous parts as soon as it is received completely. Clients should process the individual parts as soon as they arrive and should not wait for the whole message to finish.

Originally developed by Netscape, it is still supported by Mozilla, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. It is commonly used in IP cameras as the MIME type for MJPEG streams. It was supported by Chrome for main resources until 2013 (images can still be displayed using this content type).

====byterange====
The multipart/byterange is used to represent noncontiguous byte ranges of a single message, it is used by HTTP when a server returns multiple byte ranges and is defined in RFC 2616.

<text>Mehmed II (; , ; 30 March 14323 May 1481), commonly known as Mehmed the Conqueror (; ), was twice the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from August 1444 to September 1446 and then later from February 1451 to May 1481.

In Mehmed II&#x27;s first reign, he defeated the crusade led by John Hunyadi after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce per the Treaties of Edirne and Szeged. When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451, he strengthened the Ottoman Navy and made preparations to attack Constantinople. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire. After the conquest, Mehmed claimed the title caesar of Rome (), based on the fact that Constantinople had been the seat and capital of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire since its consecration in 330 AD by Emperor Constantine I. The claim was soon recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, albeit not by most European monarchs.

Mehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. At home, he made many political and social reforms. He encouraged the arts and sciences, and by the end of his reign, his rebuilding program had changed Constantinople into a thriving imperial capital. He is considered a hero in modern-day Turkey and parts of the wider Muslim world. Among other things, Istanbul&#x27;s Fatih district, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge and Fatih Mosque are named after him.

== Early life and first reign ==

Mehmed II was born on 30 March 1432, in Edirne, then the capital city of the Ottoman state. His father was Sultan Murad II (1404–1451) and his mother Hüma Hatun, a slave of uncertain origin.

When Mehmed II was eleven years old, he was sent to Amasya with his two &quot;lalas&quot; (advisors) to govern and thus gain experience, per the custom of Ottoman rulers before his time. Sultan Murad II also sent a number of teachers for him to study under. This Islamic education had a great impact in molding Mehmed&#x27;s mindset and reinforcing his Muslim beliefs. He was influenced in his practice of Islamic by practitioners of science, particularly by his mentor, Molla Gürâni, and he followed their approach. The influence of Akshamsaddin in Mehmed&#x27;s life became predominant from a young age, especially in the imperative of fulfilling his Islamic duty to overthrow the Byzantine Empire by conquering Constantinople.

After Murad II made peace with Hungary on 12 June 1444, he abdicated the throne in favour of his 12-year-old son Mehmed II in July/August 1444.

During Mehmed II&#x27;s first reign, he defeated the crusade led by John Hunyadi after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce per the Treaties of Edirne and Szeged in September 1444. Cardinal Julian Cesarini, the representative of the Pope, had convinced the king of Hungary that breaking the truce with Muslims was not a betrayal. At this time, Mehmed II asked his father Murad II to reclaim the throne, but Murad II refused. According to the 17th-century chronicles, Mehmed II wrote, &quot;If you are the sultan, come and lead your armies. If I am the sultan, I hereby order you to come and lead my armies.&quot; Then, Murad II led the Ottoman army and won the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444. Halil Inalcik states that Mehmed II did not ask for his father. Instead, it was Çandarlı Halil Pasha&#x27;s effort to bring Murad II back to the throne.

In 1446, while Murad II returned to the throne, Mehmed retained the title of sultan but only acted as a governor of Manisa. Following the death of Murad II in 1451, Mehmed II became sultan for the second time. Ibrahim II of Karaman invaded the disputed area and instigated various revolts against Ottoman rule. Mehmed II conducted his first campaign against İbrahim of Karaman; Byzantines threatened to release Ottoman claimant Orhan.

==Conquests==
=== Conquest of Constantinople ===


When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451, he devoted himself to strengthening the Ottoman navy and made preparations for an attack on Constantinople. In the narrow Bosphorus Straits, the fortress Anadoluhisarı had been built by his great-grandfather Bayezid I on the Asian side; Mehmed erected an even stronger fortress called Rumelihisarı on the European side, and thus gained complete control of the strait. Having completed his fortresses, Mehmed proceeded to levy a toll on ships passing within reach of their cannon. A Venetian vessel ignoring signals to stop was sunk with a single shot and all the surviving sailors beheaded, except for the captain, who was impaled and mounted like a human scarecrow as a warning to other sailors on the strait.

Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, the companion and standard bearer of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, had died during the first Siege of Constantinople (674–678). As Mehmed II&#x27;s army approached Constantinople, Mehmed&#x27;s sheikh Akshamsaddin discovered the tomb of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. After the conquest, Mehmed built Eyüp Sultan Mosque at the site to emphasize the importance of the conquest to the Islamic world and highlight his role as ghazi.

In 1453, Mehmed commenced the siege of Constantinople with an army between 80,000 and 200,000 troops, an artillery train of over seventy large field pieces, and a navy of 320 vessels, the bulk of them transports and storeships. The city was surrounded by sea and land; the fleet at the entrance of the Bosphorus stretched from shore to shore in the form of a crescent, to intercept or repel any assistance for Constantinople from the sea. In early April, the Siege of Constantinople began. At first, the city&#x27;s walls held off the Turks, even though Mehmed&#x27;s army used the new bombard designed by Orban, a giant cannon similar to the Dardanelles Gun. The harbor of the Golden Horn was blocked by a boom chain and defended by twenty-eight warships.

On 22 April, Mehmed transported his lighter warships overland, around the Genoese colony of Galata, and into the Golden Horn&#x27;s northern shore; eighty galleys were transported from the Bosphorus after paving a route, little over one mile, with wood. Thus, the Byzantines stretched their troops over a longer portion of the walls. About a month later, Constantinople fell, on 29 May, following a fifty-seven-day siege. After this conquest, Mehmed moved the Ottoman capital from Adrianople to Constantinople.

When Sultan Mehmed II stepped into the ruins of the Boukoleon, known to the Ottomans and Persians as the Palace of the Caesars, probably built over a thousand years before by Theodosius II, he uttered the famous lines of Saadi:

Some Muslim scholars claimed that a hadith in Musnad Ahmad referred specifically to Mehmed&#x27;s conquest of Constantinople, seeing it as the fulfillment of a prophecy and a sign of the approaching apocalypse.

After the conquest of Constantinople, Mehmed claimed the title of caesar of the Roman Empire (&quot;Qayser-i Rûm&quot;), based on the assertion that Constantinople had been the seat and capital of the Roman Empire since 330 AD and whoever possessed the Imperial capital was the ruler of the empire. The contemporary scholar George of Trebizond supported his claim. The claim was not recognized by the Catholic Church and most of, if not all, Western Europe, but was recognized by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Mehmed had installed Gennadius Scholarius, a staunch antagonist of the West, as the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople with all the ceremonial elements, ethnarch (or &quot;milletbashi&quot;) status, and rights of property that made him the second largest landlord in the empire after the sultan himself in 1454, and in turn, Gennadius II recognized Mehmed the Conqueror as the successor to the throne.

Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen to the Ottomans, he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother. Those children were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed Hass Murad, became a personal favorite of Mehmed and served as beylerbey of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed Mesih Pasha, became admiral of the Ottoman fleet and sanjak-bey of the Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed&#x27;s son, Bayezid II.

After the fall of Constantinople, Mehmed would also go on to conquer the Despotate of Morea in the Peloponnese in two campaigns in 1458 and 1460 and the Empire of Trebizond in northeastern Anatolia in 1461. The last two vestiges of Byzantine rule were thus absorbed by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Constantinople bestowed immense glory and prestige on the country. There is some historical evidence that, 10 years after the conquest of Constantinople, Mehmed II visited the site of Troy and boasted that he had avenged the Trojans by conquering the Greeks (Byzantines).

=== Conquest of Serbia (1454–1459) ===
Mehmed II&#x27;s first campaigns after Constantinople were in the direction of Serbia, which had been an Ottoman vassal state intermittently since the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. The Ottoman ruler had a connection with the Serbian Despotate – one of Murad II&#x27;s wives was Mara Branković – and he used that fact to claim Serbian lands. Đurađ Branković&#x27;s recently made alliance with the Hungarians, and his irregular payments of tribute, further served as justifications for the invasion. The Ottomans sent an ultimatum demanding the keys to some Serbian castles which formerly belonged to the Ottomans. When Serbia refused these demands, the Ottoman army led by Mehmed set out from Edirne towards Serbia in 1454, sometime after the 18th of April. Mehmed&#x27;s forces quickly succeeded in capturing Sivricehisar (sometimes identified with the Ostrvica Fortress) and Omolhisar, and repulsed a Serbian cavalry force of 9,000 cavalry sent against them by the despot. Following these actions, the Serbian capital of Smederevo was put under siege by the Ottoman forces. Before the city could be taken, intelligence was received about an approaching Hungarian relief force led by Hunyadi, which caused Mehmed to lift the siege and start marching back to his domains. By August the campaign was effectively over, Mehmed left a part of his force under the command of Firuz Bey in Serbia in anticipation of a possible offensive on Ottoman territories by Hunyadi. This force was defeated by a combined Hungarian-Serbian army led by Hunyadi and Nikola Skobaljić on the 2nd of October near Kruševac, after which Hunyadi went on to raid Ottoman controlled Nish and Pirot before returning back to Belgrade. Roughly a month later, on the 16th of November, the Ottomans avenged their earlier defeat at Kruševac by defeating Skobaljić&#x27;s army near Tripolje, where the Serbian voivode was captured and executed via impalement. Following this a temporary treaty was signed with the Serbian despot, where Đurađ would formally recognize the recently captured Serbian forts as Ottoman land, send thirty thousand florins to the Porte as yearly tribute and provide troops for Ottoman campaigns. The 1454 campaign had resulted in the capture of fifty thousand prisoners from Serbia, four thousand of whom were settled in various villages near Constantinople. The following year, Mehmed received reports from one of his frontier commanders about Serbian weakness against a possible invasion, the reports in combination with the dissatisfactory results of the 1454 campaign convinced Mehmed to initiate another campaign against Serbia. The Ottoman army marched on the important mining town of Novo Brdo, which Mehmed put under siege. The Serbians couldn&#x27;t resist the Ottoman army out in the open, thus resorted to fortifying their various settlements and having their peasants flee to either various fortresses or forests. After forty days of siege and intense cannon fire, Novo Brdo surrendered. Following the conquest of the city, Mehmed captured various other Serbian settlements in the surrounding area, after which he started his march back towards Edirne, visiting his ancestor Murad I&#x27;s grave in Kosovo on the way. 

In 1456, Mehmed decided to continue his momentum towards the northwest and capture the city of Belgrade, which had been ceded to the Kingdom of Hungary by the Serbian despot Đurađ Branković in 1427. Significant preparations were made by the Sultan for the conquest of the city, including the casting of 22 large cannons alongside many smaller ones and the establishment of a navy which would sail up the Danube to aid the army during the siege. The exact number of troops Mehmed commanded varies between sources, but the rumours of its size were significant enough to cause panic in Italy. Ottoman troops began arriving at Belgrade on the 13th of June. After the necessary preparations were finished, Ottoman cannons started bombarding the city walls and Ottoman troops started filling the ditches in front of the walls with earth to advance forward. As despair started to set in amongst the defenders, news started arriving of a relief force assembling across the Danube under the command of John Hunyadi. Upon learning of this development, Mehmed held a war council with his commanders to determine the army&#x27;s next actions. Karaca Pasha recommended that a part of the army should cross the Danube to counter the approaching relief army. This plan was rejected by the council, particularly due to the opposition by the Rumelian Begs. Instead, the decision was made to prioritize capturing the fortress, a move seen as a tactical blunder by modern historians. This allowed Hunyadi to set up camp with his army across the Danube uncontested. Shortly after, the Ottoman navy was defeated in a five hour long battle by the newly arrived Christian Danubian navy. Following this, Hunyadi&#x27;s troops started entering the city to reinforce the besieged, which increased the morale of the defending forces. Infuriated by the unfolding events, Mehmed ordered a final attack to capture the city on the 21st of July, after continuous cannon fire building up to the day of the attack. Ottoman troops were initially successful in breaching the defences and entering the city, however were eventually repulsed by the defenders. The Christians pressed their advantage by launching a counter attack, which started pushing back the Ottoman forces, managing to advance as far as the Ottoman camp. At this crucial point of the battle, one of the viziers advised Mehmed to abandon the camp for his safety, which he refused to do so on the grounds that it would be a &quot;sign of cowardice&quot;. After this, Mehmed personally joined the fighting, accompanied by two of his begs. The Sultan managed to personally kill three enemy soldiers before being injured, forcing him to abandon the battlefield. The news of their Sultan fighting alongside them and the arrival of reinforcements caused a morale boost amongst the Ottoman troops, which allowed them to go on the offensive again and push the Christian forces out of the Ottoman camp. The actions of the Sultan had prevented a complete rout of the Ottoman army, however, the army had been far too weakened to attempt to take the city again, causing the Ottoman war council to decide on ending the siege. The Sultan and his army began a retreat to Edirne during the night, without the Christian forces being able to pursue them. Hunyadi died shortly after the siege, meanwhile Đurađ Branković regained possession of some parts of Serbia.

Shortly before the end of the year 1456, roughly 5 months after the Siege of Belgrade, the 79-year-old Branković died. Serbian independence survived after him for only around three years, when the Ottoman Empire formally annexed Serbian lands following dissension among his widow and three remaining sons. Lazar, the youngest, poisoned his mother and exiled his brothers, but he died soon afterwards. In the continuing turmoil the oldest brother Stefan Branković gained the throne. Observing the chaotic situation in Serbia, the Ottoman government decided to definitively conclude the Serbian issue. The Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha was dispatched with an army to the region in 1458, where he initially conquered Resava and a number of other settlements before moving towards Smederevo. After a battle outside the city walls, the defenders were forced to retreat inside the fortress. In the ensuing siege, the outer walls were breached by Ottoman forces, however the Serbians continued to resist inside the inner walls of the fortress. Not wanting to waste time capturing the inner citadel, Mahmud lifted the siege diverted his army elsewhere, conquering Rudnik and its environs before attacking and capturing the fortress of Golubac. Subsequently, Mehmed who had returned from his campaign in Morea met up with Mahmud Pasha in Skopje. During this meeting, reports were received that a Hungarian army was assembling near the Danube to launch an offensive against the Ottoman positions in the region. The Hungarians crossed the Danube near Belgrade, after which they marched south towards Užice. While the Hungarian troops were engaged in plunder near Užice, they got ambushed by the Ottoman forces in the region, forcing them to retreat. Despite this victory, for Serbia to be fully annexed into the empire, Smederevo still had to be taken. The opportunity for its capture presented itself the following year. Stefan Branković was ousted from power in March 1459. After that the Serbian throne was offered to Stephen Tomašević, the future king of Bosnia, which infuriated Sultan Mehmed. After Mahmud Pasha suppressed an uprising near Pizren, Mehmed personally led an army against the Serbian capital, capturing Smederevo on the 20th of June 1459. After the surrender of the capital, other Serbian castles which continued to resist were captured in the following months, ending the existence of the Serbian Despotate.

=== Conquest of the Morea (1458–1460) ===
The Despotate of the Morea bordered the southern Ottoman Balkans. The Ottomans had already invaded the region under Murad II, destroying the Byzantine defenses – the Hexamilion wall – at the Isthmus of Corinth in 1446. Before the final siege of Constantinople, Mehmed ordered Ottoman troops to attack the Morea. The despots, Demetrios Palaiologos and Thomas Palaiologos, brothers of the last emperor, failed to send any aid. The chronic instability and the tribute payment to the Turks, after the peace treaty of 1446 with Mehmed II, resulted in an Albanian-Greek revolt against them, during which the brothers invited Ottoman troops to help put down the revolt. At this time, a number of influential Moreote Greeks and Albanians made private peace with Mehmed. After more years of incompetent rule by the despots, their failure to pay their annual tribute to the Sultan, and finally their own revolt against Ottoman rule, Mehmed entered the Morea in May 1460. The capital Mistra fell exactly seven years after Constantinople, on 29 May 1460. Demetrios ended up a prisoner of the Ottomans and his younger brother Thomas fled. By the end of the summer, the Ottomans had achieved the submission of virtually all cities possessed by the Greeks.

A few holdouts remained for a time. The island of Monemvasia refused to surrender, and it was ruled for a brief time by a Catalan corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to submit to the Pope&#x27;s protection before the end of 1460. The Mani Peninsula, on the Morea&#x27;s south end, resisted under a loose coalition of local clans, and the area then came under the rule of Venice. The last holdout was Salmeniko, in the Morea&#x27;s northwest. Graitzas Palaiologos was the military commander there, stationed at Salmeniko Castle (also known as Castle Orgia). While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.

=== Conquest of Trebizond (1460–1461) ===

Emperors of Trebizond formed alliances through royal marriages with various Muslim rulers. Emperor John IV of Trebizond married his daughter to the son of his brother-in-law, Uzun Hasan, sultan of the Aq Qoyunlu (also known as White Sheep Turkomans), in return for his promise to defend Trebizond. He also secured promises of support from the Turkish beys of Sinope and Karamania, and from the king and princes of Georgia. The Ottomans were motivated to capture Trebizond or to get an annual tribute. In the time of Murad II, they first attempted to take the capital by sea in 1442, but bad weather made the landings difficult and the attempt was repulsed. While Mehmed II was away laying siege to Belgrade in 1456, the Ottoman governor of Amasya attacked Trebizond, and although he was defeated, he took many prisoners and extracted a heavy tribute.

After John&#x27;s death in 1459, his brother David came to power and intrigued with various European powers for help against the Ottomans, speaking of wild schemes that included the conquest of Jerusalem. Mehmed II eventually heard of these intrigues and was further provoked to action by David&#x27;s demand that Mehmed remit the tribute imposed on his brother.

Mehmed the Conqueror&#x27;s response came in the summer of 1461. He led a sizable army from Bursa by land and the Ottoman navy by sea, first to Sinope, joining forces with Ismail&#x27;s brother Ahmed (the Red). He captured Sinope and ended the official reign of the Jandarid dynasty, although he appointed Ahmed as the governor of Kastamonu and Sinope, only to revoke the appointment the same year. Various other members of the Jandarid dynasty were offered important functions throughout the history of the Ottoman Empire. During the march to Trebizond, Uzun Hasan sent his mother Sara Khatun as an ambassador; while they were climbing the steep heights of Zigana on foot, she asked Sultan Mehmed why he was undergoing such hardship for the sake of Trebizond. Mehmed replied:

Having isolated Trebizond, Mehmed quickly swept down upon it before the inhabitants knew he was coming, and he placed it under siege. The city held out for a month before the emperor David surrendered on 15 August 1461.

=== Submission of Wallachia (1459–1462) ===

The Ottomans since the early 15th century tried to bring Wallachia () under their control by putting their own candidate on the throne, but each attempt ended in failure. The Ottomans regarded Wallachia as a buffer zone between them and the Kingdom of Hungary and for a yearly tribute did not meddle in their internal affairs. The two primary Balkan powers, Hungary and the Ottomans, maintained an enduring struggle to make Wallachia their own vassal. To prevent Wallachia from falling into the Hungarian fold, the Ottomans freed young Vlad III (Dracula), who had spent four years as a prisoner of Murad, together with his brother Radu, so that Vlad could claim the throne of Wallachia. His rule was short-lived, however, as Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and restored his ally Vladislav II, of the Dănești clan, to the throne.

Vlad III Dracula fled to Moldavia, where he lived under the protection of his uncle, Bogdan II. In October 1451, Bogdan was assassinated and Vlad fled to Hungary. Impressed by Vlad&#x27;s vast knowledge of the mindset and inner workings of the Ottoman Empire, as well as his hatred towards the Turks and new Sultan Mehmed II, Hunyadi reconciled with his former enemy and tried to make Vlad III his own advisor, but Vlad refused.

In 1456, three years after the Ottomans had conquered Constantinople, they threatened Hungary by besieging Belgrade. Hunyadi began a concerted counterattack in Serbia: While he himself moved into Serbia and relieved the siege (before dying of the plague), Vlad III Dracula led his own contingent into Wallachia, reconquered his native land, and killed Vladislav II.

In 1459, Mehmed II sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay a delayed tribute of 10,000 ducats and 500 recruits into the Ottoman forces. Vlad III Dracula refused and had the Ottoman envoys killed by nailing their turbans to their heads, on the pretext that they had refused to raise their &quot;hats&quot; to him, as they only removed their headgear before Allah.

Meanwhile, the Sultan sent the Bey of Nicopolis, Hamza Pasha, to make peace and, if necessary, eliminate Vlad III. Vlad III set an ambush; the Ottomans were surrounded and almost all of them caught and impaled, with Hamza Pasha impaled on the highest stake, as befit his rank.

In the winter of 1462, Vlad III crossed the Danube and scorched the entire Bulgarian land in the area between Serbia and the Black Sea. Allegedly disguising himself as a Turkish Sipahi and utilizing his command of the Turkish language and customs, Vlad III infiltrated Ottoman camps, ambushed, massacred or captured several Ottoman forces. In a letter to Corvinus dated 2 February, he wrote:

Mehmed II abandoned his siege of Corinth to launch a punitive attack against Vlad III in Wallachia but suffered many casualties in a surprise night attack led by Vlad III Dracula, who was apparently bent on personally killing the Sultan. However, Vlad&#x27;s policy of staunch resistance against the Ottomans was not a popular one, and he was betrayed by the boyars&#x27;s (local aristocracy) appeasing faction, most of them also pro-Dăneşti (a rival princely branch). His best friend and ally Stephen III of Moldavia, who had promised to help him, seized the chance and instead attacked him trying to take back the Fortress of Chilia. Vlad III had to retreat to the mountains. After this, the Ottomans captured the Wallachian capital Târgoviște and Mehmed II withdrew, having left Radu as ruler of Wallachia. Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey, who served with distinction and wiped out a force of 6,000 Wallachians and deposited 2,000 of their heads at the feet of Mehmed II, was also reinstated, as a reward, in his old gubernatorial post in Thessaly. Vlad eventually escaped to Hungary, where he was imprisoned on a false accusation of treason against his overlord, Matthias Corvinus.

=== Conquest of Bosnia (1463) ===
The despot of Serbia, Lazar Branković, died in 1458, and a civil war broke out among his heirs that resulted in the Ottoman conquest of Serbia in 1459/1460. Stephen Tomašević, son of the king of Bosnia, tried to bring Serbia under his control, but Ottoman expeditions forced him to give up his plan and Stephen fled to Bosnia, seeking refuge at the court of his father. After some battles, Bosnia became tributary kingdom to the Ottomans.

On 10 July 1461, Stephen Thomas died, and Stephen Tomašević succeeded him as King of Bosnia. In 1461, Stephen Tomašević made an alliance with the Hungarians and asked Pope Pius II for help in the face of an impending Ottoman invasion. In 1463, after a dispute over the tribute paid annually by the Bosnian Kingdom to the Ottomans, he sent for help from the Venetians. However, none ever reached Bosnia. In 1463, Sultan Mehmed II led an army into the country. The royal city of Bobovac soon fell, leaving Stephen Tomašević to retreat to Jajce and later to Ključ. Mehmed invaded Bosnia and conquered it very quickly, executing Stephen Tomašević and his uncle Radivoj. Bosnia officially fell in 1463 and became the westernmost province of the Ottoman Empire.

===Ottoman-Venetian War (1463–1479)===
According to the Byzantine historian Michael Critobulus, hostilities broke out after an Albanian slave of the Ottoman commander of Athens fled to the Venetian fortress of Coron (Koroni) with 100,000 silver aspers from his master&#x27;s treasure. The fugitive then converted to Christianity, so Ottoman demands for his rendition were refused by the Venetian authorities. Using this as a pretext in November 1462, the Ottoman commander in central Greece, Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey, attacked and nearly succeeded in taking the strategically important Venetian fortress of Lepanto (Nafpaktos). On 3 April 1463, however, the governor of the Morea, Isa Beg, took the Venetian-held town of Argos by treason.

The new alliance launched a two-pronged offensive against the Ottomans: a Venetian army, under the Captain General of the Sea Alvise Loredan, landed in the Morea, while Matthias Corvinus invaded Bosnia. At the same time, Pius II began assembling an army at Ancona, hoping to lead it in person. Negotiations were also begun with other rivals of the Ottomans, such as Karamanids, Uzun Hassan and the Crimean Khanate.

In early August, the Venetians retook Argos and refortified the Isthmus of Corinth, restoring the Hexamilion wall and equipping it with many cannons. They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the Acrocorinth, which controlled the northwestern Peloponnese. The Venetians engaged in repeated clashes with the defenders and with Ömer Bey&#x27;s forces, until they suffered a major defeat on 20 October and were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion and to Nauplia (Nafplion). In Bosnia, Matthias Corvinus seized over sixty fortified places and succeeded in taking its capital, Jajce, after a 3-month siege, on 16 December.

Ottoman reaction was swift and decisive: Mehmed II dispatched his Grand Vizier, Mahmud Pasha Angelović, with an army against the Venetians. To confront the Venetian fleet, which had taken station outside the entrance of the Dardanelles Straits, the Sultan further ordered the creation of the new shipyard of Kadirga Limani in the Golden Horn (named after the &quot;kadirga&quot; type of galley), and of two forts to guard the Straits, Kilidulbahr and Sultaniye. The Morean campaign was swiftly victorious for the Ottomans; they razed the Hexamilion, and advanced into the Morea. Argos fell, and several forts and localities that had recognized Venetian authority reverted to their Ottoman allegiance.

Sultan Mehmed II, who was following Mahmud Pasha with another army to reinforce him, had reached Zeitounion (Lamia) before being apprised of his Vizier&#x27;s success. Immediately, he turned his men north, towards Bosnia. However, the Sultan&#x27;s attempt to retake Jajce in July and August 1464 failed, with the Ottomans retreating hastily in the face of Corvinus&#x27; approaching army. A new Ottoman army under Mahmud Pasha then forced Corvinus to withdraw, but Jajce was not retaken for many years after. However, the death of Pope Pius II on 15 August in Ancona spelled the end of the Crusade.

In the meantime, the Venetian Republic had appointed Sigismondo Malatesta for the upcoming campaign of 1464. He launched attacks against Ottoman forts and engaged in a failed siege of Mistra in August through October. Small-scale warfare continued on both sides, with raids and counter-raids, but a shortage of manpower and money meant that the Venetians remained largely confined to their fortified bases, while Ömer Bey&#x27;s army roamed the countryside.

In the Aegean, the Venetians tried to take Lesbos in the spring of 1464, and besieged the capital Mytilene for six weeks, until the arrival of an Ottoman fleet under Mahmud Pasha on 18 May forced them to withdraw. Another attempt to capture the island shortly after also failed. The Venetian navy spent the remainder of the year in ultimately fruitless demonstrations of force before the Dardanelles. In early 1465, Mehmed II sent peace feelers to the Venetian Senate; distrusting the Sultan&#x27;s motives, these were rejected.

In April 1466, the Venetian war effort was reinvigorated under Vettore Cappello: the fleet took the northern Aegean islands of Imbros, Thasos, and Samothrace, and then sailed into the Saronic Gulf. On 12 July, Cappello landed at Piraeus and marched against Athens, the Ottomans&#x27; major regional base. He failed to take the Acropolis and was forced to retreat to Patras, the capital of Peloponnese and the seat of the Ottoman bey, which was being besieged by a joint force of Venetians and Greeks. Before Cappello could arrive, and as the city seemed on the verge of falling, Ömer Bey suddenly appeared with 12,000 cavalry and drove the outnumbered besiegers off. Six hundred Venetians and a hundred Greeks were taken prisoner out of a force of 2,000, while Barbarigo himself was killed. Cappello, who arrived some days later, attacked the Ottomans but was heavily defeated. Demoralized, he returned to Negroponte with the remains of his army. There Cappello fell ill and died on 13 March 1467. In 1470 Mehmed personally led an Ottoman army to besiege Negroponte. The Venetian relief navy was defeated, and Negroponte was captured.

In spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against the Albanians. Under their leader, Skanderbeg, they had long resisted the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy. Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania but was unsuccessful. The winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance. Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus (Lezhë), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage. After Skanderbeg died, some Venetian-controlled northern Albanian garrisons continued to hold territories coveted by the Ottomans, such as Žabljak Crnojevića, Drisht, Lezhë, and Shkodra – the most significant. Mehmed II sent his armies to take Shkodra in 1474 but failed. Then he went personally to lead the siege of Shkodra of 1478–79. The Venetians and Shkodrans resisted the assaults and continued to hold the fortress until Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Constantinople as a condition of ending the war.

The agreement was established as a result of the Ottomans having reached the outskirts of Venice. Based on the terms of the treaty, the Venetians were allowed to keep Ulcinj, Antivan, and Durrës. However, they ceded Shkodra, which had been under Ottoman siege for many months, as well as other territories on the Dalmatian coastline, and they relinquished control of the Greek islands of Negroponte (Euboea) and Lemnos. Moreover, the Venetians were forced to pay 100,000 ducat indemnity and agreed to a tribute of around 10,000 ducats per year in order to acquire trading privileges in the Black Sea. As a result of this treaty, Venice acquired a weakened position in the Levant.

=== Anatolian conquests (1464–1473) ===

During the post-Seljuks era in the second half of the Middle Ages, numerous Turkmen principalities collectively known as Anatolian beyliks emerged in Anatolia. Karamanids initially centred around the modern provinces of Karaman and Konya, the most important power in Anatolia. But towards the end of the 14th century, Ottomans began to dominate on most of Anatolia, reducing the Karaman influence and prestige.

İbrahim II of Karaman was the ruler of Karaman, and during his last years, his sons began struggling for the throne. His heir apparent was İshak of Karaman, the governor of Silifke. But Pir Ahmet, a younger son, declared himself as the bey of Karaman in Konya. İbrahim escaped to a small city in western territories where he died in 1464. The competing claims to the throne resulted in an interregnum in the &quot;beylik&quot;. Nevertheless, with the help of Uzun Hasan, İshak was able to ascend to the throne. His reign was short, however, as Pir Ahmet appealed to Sultan Mehmed II for help, offering Mehmed some territory that İshak refused to cede. With Ottoman help, Pir Ahmet defeated İshak in the battle of Dağpazarı. İshak had to be content with Silifke up to an unknown date. Pir Ahmet kept his promise and ceded a part of the &quot;beylik&quot; to the Ottomans, but he was uneasy about the loss. So, during the Ottoman campaign in the West, he recaptured his former territory. Mehmed returned, however, and captured both Karaman (Larende) and Konya in 1466. Pir Ahmet barely escaped to the East. A few years later, Ottoman vizier (later grand vizier) Gedik Ahmet Pasha captured the coastal region of the &quot;beylik&quot;.

Pir Ahmet as well as his brother Kasım escaped to Uzun Hasan&#x27;s territory. This gave Uzun Hasan a chance to interfere. In 1472, the Akkoyunlu army invaded and raided most of Anatolia (this was the reason behind the Battle of Otlukbeli in 1473). But then Mehmed led a successful campaign against Uzun Hasan in 1473 that resulted in the decisive victory of the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Otlukbeli. Before that, Pir Ahmet with Akkoyunlu help had captured Karaman. However, Pir Ahmet could not enjoy another term. Because immediately after the capture of Karaman, the Akkoyunlu army was defeated by the Ottomans near Beyşehir and Pir Ahmet had to escape once more. Although he tried to continue his struggle, he learned that his family members had been transferred to Istanbul by Gedik Ahmet Pasha, so he finally gave up. Demoralized, he escaped to Akkoyunlu territory where he was given a &quot;tımar&quot; (fief) in Bayburt. He died in 1474.

Uniting the Anatolian &quot;beylik&quot;s was first accomplished by Sultan Bayezid I, more than fifty years before Mehmed II but after the destructive Battle of Ankara in 1402, the newly formed unification was gone. Mehmed II recovered Ottoman power over the other Turkish states, and these conquests allowed him to push further into Europe.

Another important political entity that shaped the Eastern policy of Mehmed II were the Aq Qoyunlu. Under the leadership of Uzun Hasan, this kingdom gained power in the East, but because of its strong relations with Christian powers like the Empire of Trebizond and the Republic of Venice and the alliance between the Turcomans and the Karamanid tribe, Mehmed saw them as a threat to his own power.

=== War with Moldavia (1475–1476) ===
In 1456, Peter III Aaron agreed to pay the Ottomans an annual tribute of 2,000 gold ducats to ensure his southern borders, thus becoming the first Moldavian ruler to accept the Turkish demands. His successor Stephen the Great rejected Ottoman suzerainty and a series of fierce wars ensued. Stephen tried to bring Wallachia under his sphere of influence and so supported his own choice for the Wallachian throne. This resulted in an enduring struggle between different Wallachian rulers backed by Hungarians, Ottomans, and Stephen. An Ottoman army under Hadim Pasha (governor of Rumelia) was sent in 1475 to punish Stephen for his meddling in Wallachia; however, the Ottomans suffered a great defeat at the Battle of Vaslui. Stephen inflicted a decisive defeat on the Ottomans, described as &quot;the greatest ever secured by the Cross against Islam,&quot; with casualties, according to Venetian and Polish records, reaching beyond 40,000 on the Ottoman side. Mara Brankovic (Mara Hatun), the former younger wife of Murad II, told a Venetian envoy that the invasion had been worst ever defeat for the Ottomans. Stephen was later awarded the title &quot;Athleta Christi&quot; (Champion of Christ) by Pope Sixtus IV, who referred to him as &quot;verus christianae fidei athleta&quot; (&quot;the true defender of the Christian faith&quot;). Mehmed II assembled a large army and entered Moldavia in June 1476. Meanwhile, groups of Tartars from the Crimean Khanate (the Ottomans&#x27; recent ally) were sent to attack Moldavia. Romanian sources may state that they were repelled. Other sources state that joint Ottoman and Crimean Tartar forces &quot;occupied Bessarabia and took Akkerman, gaining control of the southern mouth of the Danube. Stephan tried to avoid open battle with the Ottomans by following a scorched-earth policy&quot;.

Finally, Stephen faced the Ottomans in battle. The Moldavians luring the main Ottoman forces into a forest that was set on fire, causing some casualties. According to another battle description, the defending Moldavian forces repelled several Ottoman attacks with steady fire from hand-guns. The attacking Turkish Janissaries were forced to crouch on their stomachs instead of charging headlong into the defenders positions. Seeing the imminent defeat of his forces, Mehmed charged with his personal guard against the Moldavians, managing to rally the Janissaries, and turning the tide of the battle. Turkish Janissaries penetrated inside the forest and engaged the defenders in man-to-man fighting.

The Moldavian army was utterly defeated (casualties were very high on both sides), and the chronicles say that the entire battlefield was covered with the bones of the dead, a probable source for the toponym (&quot;Valea Albă&quot; is Romanian and &quot;Akdere&quot; Turkish for &quot;The White Valley&quot;).

Stephen the Great retreated into the north-western part of Moldavia or even into the Polish Kingdom and began forming another army.
The Ottomans were unable to conquer any of the major Moldavian strongholds (Suceava, Neamț, and Hotin) and were constantly harassed by small-scale Moldavian attacks. Soon they were also confronted with starvation, a situation made worse by an outbreak of the plague, and the Ottoman army returned to Ottoman lands. The threat of Stephen to Wallachia continued for decades. That very same year Stephen helped his cousin Vlad the Impaler return to the throne of Wallachia for the third and final time. Even after Vlad&#x27;s untimely death several months later Stephen continued to support, with force of arms, a variety of contenders to the Wallachian throne succeeding after Mehmet&#x27;s death to instate Vlad Călugărul, half brother to Vlad the Impaler, for a period of 13 years from 1482 to 1495.

===Conquest of Albania (1466–1478)===
Skanderbeg, a member of the Albanian nobility and a former member of the Ottoman ruling elite, led a rebellion against the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into Europe. Skanderbeg, son of Gjon Kastrioti (who had joined the unsuccessful Albanian revolt of 1432–1436), united the Albanian principalities in a military and diplomatic alliance, the League of Lezhë, in 1444. Mehmed II was never successful in his efforts to subjugate Albania while Skanderbeg was alive, even though he twice (1466 and 1467) led the Ottoman armies himself against Krujë. After Skanderbeg died in 1468, the Albanians could not find a leader to replace him, and Mehmed II eventually conquered Krujë and Albania in 1478.

In spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against Skanderbeg and the Albanians. Skanderbeg had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy, and believed that the ongoing Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479) offered a golden opportunity to reassert Albanian independence; for the Venetians, the Albanians provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of Durrës () and Shkodër (). The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of Elbasan, allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically sited fortress, at the lowlands near the end of the old &quot;Via Egnatia&quot;, cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skanderbeg&#x27;s base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south. However, following the Sultan&#x27;s withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid. On his return in early 1467, his forces sallied from the highlands, defeated Ballaban Pasha, and lifted the siege of the fortress of Croia (Krujë); they also attacked Elbasan but failed to capture it. Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania. He energetically pursued the attacks against the Albanian strongholds, while sending detachments to raid the Venetian possessions to keep them isolated. The Ottomans failed again to take Croia, and they failed to subjugate the country. However, the winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance. Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus (Lezhë), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage. The Albanians were left to their own devices and were gradually subdued over the next decade.

After Skanderbeg died, Mehmed II personally led the siege of Shkodra in 1478–79, of which early Ottoman chronicler Aşıkpaşazade (1400–81) wrote, &quot;All the conquests of Sultan Mehmed were fulfilled with the seizure of Shkodra.&quot; The Venetians and Shkodrans resisted the assaults and continued to hold the fortress until Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Constantinople as a condition of ending the war.

===Crimean policy (1475)===

A number of Turkic peoples, collectively known as the Crimean Tatars, had been inhabiting the peninsula since the early Middle Ages. After the destruction of the Golden Horde by Timur earlier in the 15th century, the Crimean Tatars founded an independent Crimean Khanate under Hacı I Giray, a descendant of Genghis Khan.

The Crimean Tatars controlled the steppes that stretched from the Kuban to the Dniester River, but they were unable to take control over the commercial Genoese towns called Gazaria (Genoese colonies), which had been under Genoese control since 1357. After the conquest of Constantinople, Genoese communications were disrupted, and when the Crimean Tatars asked for help from the Ottomans, they responded with an invasion of the Genoese towns, led by Gedik Ahmed Pasha in 1475, bringing Kaffa and the other trading towns under their control. After the capture of the Genoese towns, the Ottoman Sultan held Meñli I Giray captive, later releasing him in return for accepting Ottoman suzerainty over the Crimean Khans and allowing them to rule as tributary princes of the Ottoman Empire. However, the Crimean khans still had a large amount of autonomy from the Ottoman Empire, while the Ottomans directly controlled the southern coast.

=== Expedition to Italy (1480) ===

An Ottoman army under Gedik Ahmed Pasha invaded Italy in 1480, capturing Otranto. Because of lack of food, Gedik Ahmed Pasha returned with most of his troops to Albania, leaving a garrison of 800 infantry and 500 cavalry behind to defend Otranto in Italy. It was assumed he would return after the winter. Since it was only 28 years after the fall of Constantinople, there was some fear that Rome would suffer the same fate. Plans were made for the Pope and citizens of Rome to evacuate the city. Pope Sixtus IV repeated his 1481 call for a crusade. Several Italian city-states, Hungary, and France responded positively to the appeal. The Republic of Venice did not, however, as it had signed an expensive peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1479.

In 1481 king Ferdinand I of Naples raised an army to be led by his son Alphonso II of Naples. A contingent of troops was provided by king Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. The city was besieged starting 1 May 1481. After the death of Mehmed on 3 May, ensuing quarrels about his succession possibly prevented the Ottomans from sending reinforcements to Otranto. So, the Turkish occupation of Otranto ended by negotiation with the Christian forces, permitting the Turks to withdraw to Albania, and Otranto was retaken by Papal forces in 1481.

===Return to Constantinople (1453–1478)===

After conquering Constantinople, when Mehmed II finally entered the city through what is now known as the Topkapi Gate, he immediately rode his horse to the Hagia Sophia, where he ordered the building to be protected. He ordered that an imam meet him there in order to chant the Muslim Creed: &quot;I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.&quot; The Orthodox cathedral was transformed into a Muslim mosque through a charitable trust, solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople.

Mehmed&#x27;s main concern with Constantinople was with rebuilding the city&#x27;s defenses and repopulation. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, a remarkable hospital with students and medical staff, a large cultural complex, two sets of barracks for the janissaries, a &quot;tophane&quot; gun foundry outside Galata, and a new palace. To encourage the return of the Greeks and the Genoese who had fled from Galata, the trading quarter of the city, he returned their houses and provided them with guarantees of safety. Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle in the city, demanding that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September. From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city; these people were called &quot;Sürgün&quot; in Turkish ( &quot;sourgounides&quot;; &quot;immigrants&quot;).

Mehmed restored the Ecumenical Orthodox Patriarchate (6 January 1454), monk Gennadios being appointed as the first Orthodox Patriarch, and established a Jewish Grand Rabbinate (Ḥakham Bashi) and the prestigious Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople in the capital, as part of the millet system. In addition, he founded, and encouraged his viziers to found, a number of Muslim institutions and commercial installations in the main districts of Constantinople, such as the Rum Mehmed Pasha Mosque built by the Grand Vizier Rum Mehmed Pasha. From these nuclei, the metropolis developed rapidly. According to a survey carried out in 1478, there were then in Constantinople and neighboring Galata 16,324 households, 3,927 shops, and an estimated population of 80,000. The population was about 60% Muslim, 20% Christian, and 10% Jewish.

By the end of his reign, Mehmed&#x27;s ambitious rebuilding program had changed the city into a thriving imperial capital. According to the contemporary Ottoman historian Neşri, &quot;Sultan Mehmed created all of Istanbul&quot;. Fifty years later, Constantinople had again become the largest city in Europe.

Two centuries later, the well-known Ottoman itinerant Evliya Çelebi gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of Istanbul, such as Aksaray and Çarşamba, bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants. However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmed allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city. This measure apparently had no great success, since French voyager Pierre Gilles wrote in the middle of the 16th century that the Greek population of Constantinople was unable to name any of the ancient Byzantine churches that had been transformed into mosques or abandoned. This shows that the population substitution had been total.

== Administration and culture ==

Mehmed II introduced the word Politics into Arabic &quot;Siyasah&quot; from a book he published and claimed to be the collection of Politics doctrines of the Byzantine Caesars before him. He gathered Italian artists, humanists and Greek scholars at his court, allowed the Byzantine Church to continue functioning, ordered the patriarch Gennadius to translate Christian doctrine into Turkish, and called Gentile Bellini from Venice to paint his portrait as well as Venetian frescoes that are vanished today. He collected in his palace a library that included works in Greek, Persian, and Latin. Mehmed invited Muslim scientists and astronomers such as Ali Qushji and artists to his court in Constantinople, started a university, and built mosques (for example, the Fatih Mosque), waterways, and Istanbul&#x27;s Topkapı Palace and the Tiled Kiosk.
Around the grand mosque that he constructed, he erected eight madrasas, which, for nearly a century, kept their rank as the highest teaching institutions of the Islamic sciences in the empire.

Mehmed II allowed his subjects a considerable degree of religious freedom, provided they were obedient to his rule. After his conquest of Bosnia in 1463, he issued the Ahdname of Milodraž to the Bosnian Franciscans, granting them the freedom to move freely within the Empire, offer worship in their churches and monasteries, and practice their religion free from official and unofficial persecution, insult, or disturbance. However, his standing army was recruited from the &quot;Devshirme&quot;, a group that took Christian subjects at a young age (8–20 yrs): they were converted to Islam, then schooled for administration or the military Janissaries. This was a meritocracy which &quot;produced from among their alumni four out of five Grand Viziers from this time on&quot;.

Within Constantinople, Mehmed established a &quot;millet&quot;, or an autonomous religious community, and appointed the former Patriarch Gennadius Scholarius as religious leader for the Orthodox Christians of the city. His authority extended to all Ottoman Orthodox Christians, and this excluded the Genoese and Venetian settlements in the suburbs, and excluded Muslim and Jewish settlers entirely. This method allowed for an indirect rule of the Christian Byzantines and allowed the occupants to feel relatively autonomous even as Mehmed II began the Turkish remodeling of the city, turning it into the Turkish capital, which it remained until the 1920s.

===Centralization of government===

Mehmed the Conqueror consolidated power by building his imperial court, the divan, with officials who would be solely loyal to him and allow him greater autonomy and authority. Under previous sultans the divan had been filled with members of aristocratic families that sometimes had other interests and loyalties than that of the sultan. Mehmed the Conqueror transitioned the empire away from the Ghazi mentality that emphasizes ancient traditions and ceremonies in governance and moved it towards a centralized bureaucracy largely made of officials of devşirme background. Additionally, Mehmed the Conqueror took the step of converting the religious scholars who were part of the Ottoman madrasas into salaried employees of the Ottoman bureaucracy who were loyal to him. This centralization was possible and formalized through a kanunname, issued during 1477–1481, which for the first time listed the chief officials in the Ottoman government, their roles and responsibilities, salaries, protocol and punishments, as well as how they related to each other and the sultan.

Once Mehmed had created an Ottoman bureaucracy and transformed the empire from a frontier society to a centralized government, he took care to appoint officials who would help him implement his agenda. His first grand vizier was Zaganos Pasha, who was of devşirme background as opposed to an aristocrat, and Zaganos Pasha&#x27;s successor, Mahmud Pasha Angelović, was also of devşirme background. Mehmed was the first sultan who was able to codify and implement kanunname solely based on his own independent authority. Additionally, Mehmed was able to later implement kanunname that went against previous tradition or precedent. This was monumental in an empire that was so steeped in tradition and could be slow to change or adapt. Having viziers and other officials who were loyal to Mehmed was an essential part of this government because he transferred more power to the viziers than previous sultans had. He delegated significant powers and functions of government to his viziers as part of his new policy of imperial seclusions. A wall was built around the palace as an element of the more closed era, and unlike previous sultans Mehmed was no longer accessible to the public or even lower officials. His viziers directed the military and met foreign ambassadors, two essential parts of governing especially with his numerous military campaigns. One such notable ambassador was Kinsman Karabœcu Pasha (Turkish: &quot;Karaböcü Kuzen Paşa&quot;), who came from a rooted family of spies, which enabled him to play a notable role in Mehmed&#x27;s campaign of conquering Constantinople.

=== Interest in Western culture ===

Aside from his efforts to expand Ottoman dominion throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Mehmed II also cultivated a large collection of Western art and literature, many of which were produced by Renaissance artists. From a young age, Mehmed had shown interest in Renaissance art and Classical literature and histories, with his school books having caricaturistic illustrations of ancient coins and portraiture sketched in distinctly European styles. Furthermore, he reportedly had two tutors, one trained in Greek and another in Latin, who read him Classical histories, including those of Laertius, Livy, and Herodotus, in the days leading up to the fall of Constantinople.

From early on in his reign, Mehmed invested in the patronage of Italian Renaissance artists. His first documented request in 1461 was a commission from artist Matteo de&#x27; Pasti, who resided in the court of the lord of Rimini, Sigismondo Malatesta. This first attempt was unsuccessful, though, as Pasti was arrested in Crete by Venetian authorities accusing him of being an Ottoman spy. Later attempts would prove more fruitful, with some notable artists including Costanzo da Ferrara and Gentile Bellini both being invited to the Ottoman court.

Aside from his patronage of Renaissance artists, Mehmed was also an avid scholar of contemporary and Classical literature and history. This interest culminated in Mehmed&#x27;s work on building a massive multilingual library that contained over 8000 manuscripts in Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Latin, and Greek, among other languages. Of note in this large collection was Mehmed&#x27;s Greek scriptorium, which included copies of Arrians&#x27; &quot;Anabasis of Alexander the Great&quot; and Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. His interest in Classical works extended in many directions, including the patronage of the Greek writer Kritiboulos of Imbros, who produced the Greek manuscript &quot;History of Mehmed the Conqueror&quot;, alongside his efforts to salvage and rebind Greek manuscripts acquired after his conquest of Constantinople.

Historians believe that Mehmed&#x27;s widespread cultural and artistic tastes, especially those aimed towards the West, served various important diplomatic and administrative functions. His patronage of Renaissance artists have been interpreted as a method of diplomacy with other influential Mediterranean states, significantly many Italian states including the Kingdom of Naples and the Republic of Florence. Furthermore, historians speculate that his Greek scriptorium was used to educate Greek chancellery officials in an attempt to reintegrate former Byzantine diplomatic channels with several Italian states that conducted their correspondences in Greek. Importantly, historians also assert that Mehmed&#x27;s vast collection of art and literature worked towards promoting his imperial authority and legitimacy, especially in his newly conquered lands. This was accomplished through various means, including the invocation of Mehmed&#x27;s image as an Oriental neo-Alexandrian figure, which is seen through shared helmet ornaments in depictions of Mehmed and Alexander on medallion portraits produced during Mehmed&#x27;s reign, as well as being a leitmotiv in Kritiboulous&#x27; work. Additionally, his commissioning of Renaissance artwork was, itself, possibly an attempt to break down Western-Oriental cultural binaries in order for Mehmed to present himself as a Western-oriented ruler, among the ranks of contemporary European Christian monarchs.

==== Collection of Christian art and relics ====

A significant part of Mehmed II&#x27;s foray into Western culture was his collection of Christian artwork and relics. The sultan obtained the relics after his conquest of Constantinople, when he ordered that all the relics in the local churches be brought to him. Among these relics were the putative skull and arm bone of St. John the Baptist and a stone on which, purportedly, Jesus was born. The relics were indeed very dear to him, as evidenced in a few anecdotes. For example, the sultan became &quot;greatly distressed&quot; when the royal librarian stepped on the aforementioned stone to reach a book high on a shelf. Again, after the Venetians had offered to purchase the same stone for 30,000 ducats, Mehmed replied that he would not sell it for even 100,000 ducats. This is confirmed by Guillaume Caoursin, a contemporary of the sultan, who writes that he would not sell any of his relics, for they were &quot;more precious than money.&quot; Sources even indicate that Mehmed lit candles in front of the relics of St. John the Baptist &quot;as a sign of veneration.&quot; In addition to Christian relics, Mehmed also maintained an interest in Christian artwork. The Hagia Sophia is a significant example, for, upon conquering Constantinople, Mehmed preserved the mosaics that it contained, which can still be seen today. Mehmed also himself commissioned a painting of the Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus, as two independent Italian sources report.

===== Purpose of the collection =====
Franz Babinger, a German orientalist, writes that Mehmed used these relics &quot;for purposes of bargaining with Christians.&quot; However, Julian Raby, Oxford lecturer on Islamic art and director emeritus of the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, argues the purpose of the collection is more unclear, mentioning that Niccolò Sagundino, a contemporary, writes of two conflicting opinions, the first being Babinger&#x27;s and the second being that it expressed Mehmed&#x27;s &quot;sincere devotion.&quot;

===== Reaction to the collection =====
Mehmed&#x27;s collection of Christian art and relics brought about various reactions from his contemporaries. Along with his general openness to Christianity, Mehmed&#x27;s collection was a cause of an unfulfilled hope of some in the West that he would convert to Christianity. His son and successor, Bayezid II, suspected similarly, accusing Mehmed of &quot;not believing in Muhammad.&quot; Although Mehmed&#x27;s interest in Christianity and Christian culture caused concern among traditionalist factions, Gülru Necipoğlu writes, the sources written in Islamic languages do not support &quot;such a perception of Mehmed&#x27;s irreligiosity.&quot; Upon his accession to the sultanate, Bayezid, who hated &quot;figural images of any sort,&quot; sold his father&#x27;s art collection and also offered the relics to the rulers of Rhodes, France, and Italy as ransom for his brother, Cem.

==Family==
Mehmed II had at least eight known consorts, at least one of whom was his legal wife.

=== Consorts ===
Mehmed II was the last sultan to legally marry until 1533/1534, when Suleiman the Magnificent married his favorite concubine Hürrem Sultan.

Mehmed II&#x27;s eight known consorts are:
* Gülbahar Hatun Mother of Bayezid II.
* Gülşah Hatun. Mother of Şehzade Mustafa.
* Sittişah Mukrime Hatun. Sometimes mistakenly believed to be the mother of Bayezid II. Called also Sitti Hatun. Daughter of Dulkadiroğlu Süleyman Bey, sixth ruler of Dulkadir, she was his legal wife, but the marriage was unhappy and it remained childless. Her niece Ayşe Hatun, daughter of her brother, became a consort of Bayezid II.
* Çiçek Hatun. Mother of Şehzade Cem.
* Anna Hatun. Daughter of the Greek emperor of Trebizond David II Komnenos and his wife Helena Kantakuzenos. The marriage was initially proposed by her father, but Mehmed refused. However, after the conquest of Trebizond in 1461, Anna entered Mehmed&#x27;s harem as a &quot;noble tribute&quot; or guest and stayed there for two years, after which Mehmed married her to Zaganos Mehmed Pasha. In exchange, Mehmed had the Zaganos&#x27;s daughter as his consort.
* Helena Hatun (1442–1469). Daughter of the despot of Morea Demetrios Palaiologos, Mehmed asked her for himself after the Morea campaign, having heard of her beauty. However, the union was never consummated because Mehmed feared that she might poison him.
* Maria Hatun. Born Maria Gattilusio, she was widow of Alexander Komnenos Asen, brother of Anna Hatun&#x27;s father and by him she had a son, Alexios, executed by Mehmed II. She was judicated as the most beautiful woman of her age and entered in the harem after her capture in 1462.
* Hatice Hatun. Daughter of Zaganos Mehmed Pasha by his first wife Sitti Nefise Hatun. She entered the harem in 1463. In return, her father was able to marry Anna Hatun, Mehmed&#x27;s consort or &quot;noble guest&quot;. After Mehmed&#x27;s death she remarried with a statesman.

===Sons===
Mehmed II had at least four sons:
* Bayezid II (3 December 1447 – 10 June 1512) – son of Gülbahar Hatun. He succeeded his father as the Ottoman Sultan.
* Şehzade Mustafa (1450, Manisa – 25 December 1474, Konya) – son of Gülşah Hatun. Governor of Konya until his death. He was the favorite son of his father.
* Şehzade Cem (22 December 1459, Constantinople – 25 February 1495; Capua, Kingdom of Naples, Italy) – son of Çiçek Hatun. Governor of Konya after the death of his brother Mustafa, he fought for the throne against his half-brother Bayezid. He died in exile.
* Şehzade Nureddin. Probably died as an infant.

===Daughters===
Mehmed II had at least four daughters:
* Gevherhan Hatun (1446 – Constantinople, 1514) – daughter of Gülbahar Hatun. She was the mother of Sultan Ahmad Beg.
* Ayşe Hatun.
* Kamerhan Hatun. She married her cousin Hasan Bey, son of Candaroğlu Kemaleddin İsmail Bey and Hatice Hatun, full-sister of Mehmed II. They had a daughter, Hanzade Hatun.
* &quot;Fülane&quot; Hatun.

== Personal life ==
Mehmed had a strong interest in ancient Greek and medieval Byzantine civilization. His heroes were Achilles and Alexander the Great and he could discuss Christian religion with some authority. He was reputed to be fluent in several languages, including Turkish, Serbian, Arabic, Persian, Greek and Latin.

At times, he assembled the Ulama, or learned Muslim teachers, and caused them to discuss theological problems in his presence. During his reign, mathematics, astronomy, and theology reached their highest level among the Ottomans. His social circle included a number of humanists and sages such as Ciriaco de&#x27; Pizzicolli of Ancona, Benedetto Dei of Florence and Michael Critobulus of Imbros, who mentions Mehmed as a Philhellene thanks to his interest in Grecian antiquities and relics. It was on his orders that the Parthenon and other Athenian monuments were spared destruction. Besides, Mehmed II himself was a poet writing under the name &quot;Avni&quot; (the helper, the helpful one) and he left a classical diwan poetry collection.

Some sources claim that Mehmed had a passion for his hostage and favourite, Radu the Fair. Young men condemned to death were spared and added to Mehmed&#x27;s seraglio if he found them attractive, and the Porte went to great lengths to procure young noblemen for him.

==Death and legacy==

In 1481 Mehmed marched with the Ottoman army, but upon reaching Maltepe, Istanbul, he became ill. He was just beginning new campaigns to capture Rhodes and southern Italy, however according to some historians his next voyage was planned to overthrow the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and to capture Egypt and claim the caliphate. But after some days he died, on 3 May 1481, at the age of forty-nine, and was buried in his &quot;türbe&quot; near the Fatih Mosque complex. According to the historian Colin Heywood, &quot;there is substantial circumstantial evidence that Mehmed was poisoned, possibly at the behest of his eldest son and successor, Bayezid.&quot;

The news of Mehmed&#x27;s death caused great rejoicing in Europe; church bells were rung, and celebrations held. The news was proclaimed in Venice thus: &quot;La Grande Aquila è morta!&quot; (&#x27;The Great Eagle is dead!&#x27;)

Mehmed II is recognized as the first sultan to codify criminal and constitutional law, long before Suleiman the Magnificent; he thus established the classical image of the autocratic Ottoman sultan. Mehmed&#x27;s thirty-year rule and numerous wars expanded the Ottoman Empire to include Constantinople, the Turkish kingdoms and territories of Asia Minor, Bosnia, Serbia, and Albania. Mehmed left behind an imposing reputation in both the Islamic and Christian worlds. According to historian Franz Babinger, Mehmed was regarded as a bloodthirsty tyrant by the Christian world and by a part of his subjects.

Istanbul&#x27;s Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge (completed 1988), which crosses the Bosporus Straits, is named after him, and his name and picture appeared on the Turkish 1000 lira note from 1986 to 1992.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
* Mehmed is the eponymous subject of Rossini&#x27;s 1820 opera, &quot;Maometto II&quot;. Rossini and librettist Cesare della Valle offer a nuanced picture of Mehmed, portraying him as a fearless and magnanimous leader, even on the verge of conquering Negroponte.

<doc id="19047" wikidata="Q134720" url="?curid=19047" title="Martina Hingis">
<text>Martina Hingis (, ; born 30 September 1980) is a Swiss former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 209 weeks (fifth-most of all time) and as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s doubles for 90 weeks, holding both No. 1 rankings simultaneously for 29 weeks. Hingis won 43 WTA Tour-level singles titles and 64 doubles titles, including a total of 25 major titles: five in singles, 13 in women&#x27;s doubles (including the Grand Slam in 1998), and seven in mixed doubles. In addition, she won the season-ending Tour Finals two times in singles and three in doubles, an Olympic silver medal in doubles, and a record 17 Tier I singles titles.

Hingis set a series of &quot;youngest-ever&quot; records during the 1990s, including youngest-ever Grand Slam champion and youngest-ever world No. 1. Before ligament injuries in both ankles forced her to withdraw temporarily from professional tennis in early 2003, at the age of 22, she had won 40 singles titles and 36 doubles titles and, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, was the highest-paid female athlete in the world for five consecutive years, 1997 to 2001. After several surgeries and long recoveries, Hingis returned to the WTA Tour in 2006, climbing to world No. 6 in singles, winning two Tier I tournaments, and receiving the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year. She retired in November 2007 after being hampered by a hip injury for several months. In January 2008, the International Tennis Federation suspended Hingis for two years following a positive test for a metabolite of cocaine in 2007.

In July 2013, Hingis again returned from retirement to play the doubles events of the North American hardcourt season. During her doubles-only comeback, she won four major women&#x27;s doubles tournaments, six major mixed doubles tournaments (completing the career Grand Slam in mixed doubles), 27 WTA Tour titles, and the silver medal in women&#x27;s doubles at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Hingis retired for the third and final time after the 2017 WTA Finals, while ranked as the doubles world No. 1.

Widely considered an all-time tennis great, Hingis was ranked by &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine in 2005 as the eighth-greatest female player of the preceding 40 years. She was named one of the &quot;30 Legends of Women&#x27;s Tennis: Past, Present and Future&quot; by &quot;TIME&quot; in June 2011. Hingis was the first Swiss player, male or female, to win a major title and to attain a world No. 1 ranking. In 2013, Hingis was elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and was appointed two years later the organization&#x27;s first ever Global Ambassador.
==Personal life==
Hingis was born in Košice, Czechoslovakia (now in Slovakia) as Martina Hingisová, to Melanie Molitorová and Karol Hingis, both of whom were tennis players. Molitorová was a professional tennis player who was once ranked tenth among women in Czechoslovakia, and was determined to develop Hingis into a top player as early as pregnancy. Her father was ranked as high as 19th in the Czechoslovak tennis rankings. Martina Hingis spent her early childhood growing up in the town of Rožnov pod Radhoštěm (now in the Czech Republic). Hingis&#x27;s parents divorced when she was six, and she and her mother defected from Czechoslovakia in 1987 and emigrated to Trübbach (Wartau) in Switzerland when she was seven. Her mother remarried to a Swiss man, Andreas Zogg, a computer technician. Hingis acquired Swiss citizenship through naturalization. Along with her native Czech and German, Hingis speaks English and French.

Hingis became engaged to Czech tennis player Radek Štěpánek in November 2006, but the couple broke off the engagement in August 2007. In December 2009, Hingis became engaged to then-38-year-old Andreas Bieri, a Swiss attorney she had been living with since the summer of 2009, but the couple broke off the engagement in April 2010.

On 10 December 2010, in Paris, Hingis married then-24-year-old Thibault Hutin, a French equestrian show jumper she had met at a competition in April of that year. On 8 July 2013, Hingis told the Swiss newspaper &quot;Schweizer Illustrierte&quot; the pair had been separated since the beginning of the year.

On 20 July 2018, Hingis married sports physician Harald Leemann in Switzerland in a secret ceremony at the Grand Resort Bad Ragaz. Hingis and Leemann had been in a relationship for almost a year before they got married. They were both 37. On 30 September 2018 (her 38th birthday) Hingis announced, via social media, her first pregnancy. She gave birth to a daughter, Lia, on 26 February 2019. The couple divorced in August 2022.

==Tennis career==

Hingis began playing tennis when she was two years old and entered her first tournament at age four. In 1993, 12-year-old Hingis became the youngest player to win a Grand Slam junior title: the girls&#x27; singles at the French Open. In 1994, she retained her French Open junior title, won the girls&#x27; singles title at Wimbledon, and reached the final of the US Open.

She made her WTA debut at the Zurich Open in October 1994, two weeks after turning 14, and ended 1994 ranked world No. 87.

===Grand Slam success and period of dominance (1996–2000)===

====1996====

In 1996, Hingis became the youngest Grand Slam champion of all time, when she teamed with Helena Suková at Wimbledon to win the women&#x27;s doubles title at age 15 years and 9 months. She also won her first professional singles title that year at Filderstadt, Germany. She reached the singles quarterfinals of the 1996 Australian Open and the singles semifinals of the 1996 US Open. Following her win at Filderstadt, Hingis defeated the reigning Australian Open champion and co-top ranked (with Steffi Graf) Monica Seles in the final in Oakland, but lost to Graf in the year-end WTA Tour Championships final in five sets.

====1997====

In 1997, Hingis became the World No. 1 women&#x27;s tennis player. She started the year by winning the warm-up tournament in Sydney. She then became the youngest Grand Slam singles winner in the 20th century by winning the Australian Open at age 16 years and 3 months (beating former champion Mary Pierce in the final). She also won the Australian Open women&#x27;s doubles with Natasha Zvereva. In March, she became the youngest top ranked player in history. In July, she became the youngest singles champion at Wimbledon since Lottie Dod in 1887 by beating Jana Novotná in the final. She then defeated another up-and-coming player, Venus Williams, in the final of the US Open. The only Grand Slam singles title that Hingis failed to win in 1997 was the French Open, where she lost in the final to Iva Majoli.

====1998: Doubles Grand Slam====

In 1998, Hingis won all four of the Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles titles, only the fourth in women&#x27;s tennis history to do so, (the Australian Open with Mirjana Lučić and the other three events with Novotná), and she became only the third woman to hold the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles simultaneously. She also retained her Australian Open singles title by beating Conchita Martínez in straight sets in the final. Hingis, however, lost in the final of the US Open to Lindsay Davenport. Davenport ended an 80-week stretch Hingis had enjoyed as the No. 1 singles player in October 1998, but Hingis finished the year by beating Davenport in the final of the WTA Tour Championships.

====1999====

1999 saw Hingis win her third successive Australian Open singles crown as well as the doubles title (with Anna Kournikova). She had dropped her former doubles partner Jana Novotná.
She then reached the French Open final and was three points away from victory in the second set before losing to Steffi Graf about whom she had said before: &quot;Steffi had some results in the past, but it&#x27;s a faster, more athletic game now... She is old now. Her time has passed.&quot; She broke into tears after a game in which the crowd had booed her for using underhand serves and crossing the line in a discussion about an umpire decision. After a shock first-round, straight set, loss to Jelena Dokić at Wimbledon, Hingis bounced back to reach her third consecutive US Open final, where she lost to 17-year-old Serena Williams. Hingis won a total of seven singles titles that year and reclaimed the No. 1 singles ranking. She also reached the final of the WTA Tour Championships, where she lost to Lindsay Davenport.

====2000====

In 2000, Hingis again found herself in both the singles and doubles finals at the Australian Open. This time, however, she lost both. Her three-year hold on the singles championship ended when she lost to Davenport. Later, Hingis and Mary Pierce, her new doubles partner, lost to Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. Hingis captured the French Open women&#x27;s doubles title with Pierce and produced consistent results in singles tournaments throughout the year. She reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before losing to Venus Williams. Although she did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament, the first time this had happened since 1996, she kept the year end No. 1 ranking because of nine tournament championships, including the WTA Tour Championships where she won the singles and doubles titles.

=== Injuries and first retirement from tennis (2001–2003) ===

====2001====

In 2001, Switzerland, with Hingis and Roger Federer on its team, won the Hopman Cup. Hingis didn&#x27;t drop a set in any of her singles matches during the event, defeating Tamarine Tanasugarn, Nicole Pratt, Amanda Coetzer, and Monica Seles. In 2018, after his second Hopman Cup victory, Federer was quoted as saying: &quot;I learned a lot from her, especially the two years I was here – once as a hitting partner and once as a partner with Martina. Definitely she helped me to become the player I am today.&quot;

Hingis reached her fifth consecutive Australian Open final in 2001, defeating both of the Williams sisters en route, before losing to Jennifer Capriati. She briefly ended her coaching relationship with her mother Melanie early in the year but had a change of heart two months later just before the French Open. 2001 was her least successful year in several seasons, with only three tournament victories in total. She lost her No. 1 ranking for the last time (to Jennifer Capriati) on 14 October 2001. In that same month, Hingis underwent surgery on her right ankle.

====2002====

Coming back from injury, Hingis won the Australian Open doubles final at the start of 2002 (again teaming with Anna Kournikova) and reached a sixth straight Australian Open final in singles, again facing Capriati. Hingis led by a set and 4–0 and had four match points but lost in three sets. In May 2002, she needed another ankle ligament operation, this time on her left ankle. After that, she continued to struggle with injuries and was not able to recapture her best form.

====2003====

In February 2003, at the age of 22, Hingis announced her retirement from tennis, due to her injuries and being in pain. &quot;I want to play tennis only for fun and concentrate more on horse riding and finish my studies.&quot; In several interviews, she indicated that she wished to return to her home country and coach full-time.

During this segment of her tennis career (until what would become her first retirement), Hingis won a total of 40 singles titles and 36 doubles. She held the world No. 1 singles ranking for a total of 209 weeks (fifth most following Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, and Serena Williams). In 2005, &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine put her in 22nd place in its list of 40 Greatest Players of the Tennis era.

=== Return to the game (2005–2007) ===

====2005====

In February 2005, Hingis came out of retirement and made an unsuccessful return to competition. This took place at an event in Pattaya, Thailand, where she lost to Germany&#x27;s Marlene Weingärtner in the first round. After the loss, she claimed that she had no further plans to continue further and make a full-fledged comeback.

Hingis, however, resurfaced in July, playing singles, doubles, and mixed doubles in World Team Tennis and notching up singles victories over two top 100 players and shutting out Martina Navratilova in singles on 7 July. With these promising results behind her, Hingis announced on 29 November her return to the next season&#x27;s WTA Tour.

====2006====
At the Australian Open, Hingis lost in the quarterfinals to second-seeded Kim Clijsters. However, Hingis won the mixed doubles title with Mahesh Bhupathi of India. This was her first career Grand Slam mixed doubles title and fifteenth overall (5 singles, 9 women&#x27;s doubles, 1 mixed doubles).

The week after the Australian Open, Hingis defeated world No. 4, Maria Sharapova, in the semifinals of the Tier I Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, before losing in the final to world No. 9, Elena Dementieva. Hingis competed in Dubai then, reaching the quarterfinals before falling to Sharapova. At the Tier I Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Hingis defeated world No. 4, Lindsay Davenport in the fourth round, before again losing to Sharapova in the semifinals.
At the Tier I Italian Open in Rome, Hingis posted her 500th career singles match victory in the quarterfinals, beating world No. 18 Flavia Pennetta, and subsequently won the tournament with wins over Venus Williams in the semifinals and Dinara Safina in the final. This was her 41st WTA Tour singles title and first in more than four years. Hingis then reached the quarterfinals of the French Open before losing to Kim Clijsters.

At Wimbledon, Hingis lost in the third round to Ai Sugiyama.

Hingis&#x27;s return to the US Open was short lived, as she was upset in the second round by world No. 112, Virginie Razzano of France.

In her first tournament after the US Open, Hingis won the second title of her comeback at the Tier III Sunfeast Open in Kolkata, India. She defeated unseeded Russian Olga Puchkova in the final. The following week in Seoul, Hingis notched her 50th match win of the year before losing in the second round to Sania Mirza.

Hingis qualified for the year-ending WTA Tour Championships in Madrid as the 8th seed. In her round robin matches, she lost in three sets to both Justine Henin and Amélie Mauresmo but defeated Nadia Petrova.

Hingis ended the year ranked world No. 7. She also finished eighth in prize money earnings (US$1,159,537). Hingis also ranked as No. 7 on the Annual Top Google News Searches in 2006.

====2007====

At the Australian Open, Hingis won her first three rounds without losing a set before defeating China&#x27;s Li Na in the fourth round. Hingis then lost a quarterfinal match to Kim Clijsters. This was the second consecutive year that Hingis had lost to Clijsters in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and the third time in the last five Grand Slam tournaments that Clijsters had eliminated Hingis in the quarterfinals.

Hingis won her next tournament, the Tier I Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, defeating Ana Ivanovic in the final. This was Hingis&#x27;s record fifth singles title at this event.

A hip injury that troubled her at the German Open caused her to withdraw from the Rome Masters, where she was the defending champion, and the French Open, the only important singles title that eluded her.

In her first round match at Wimbledon, Hingis saved two match points to defeat British wildcard Naomi Cavaday, apparently not having fully recovered from the hip injury that prevented her from playing the French Open. In the third round, Hingis lost to Laura Granville of the United States, and stated afterwards she should not have entered the tournament.

Hingis&#x27;s next tournament was the last Grand Slam tournament of the year, the US Open, in which Hingis lost in the third round to Belarusian teenager Victoria Azarenka. Hingis did not play any tournaments after the China Open, as she was beset by injuries for the rest of the year.

=== ITF suspension and second retirement (2007–2012) ===

In November 2007, Hingis called a press conference to announce that she was under investigation for testing positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, during a urine test taken by players at Wimbledon. Hingis&#x27;s urine sample contained an estimated 42 nanograms per millilitre of benzoylecgonine. The International Tennis Federation&#x27;s report on the matter states that &quot;the very low estimated concentration of benzoylecgonine (42 ng/ml) was such that it would go unreported in many drug testing programmes such as that of the US military, which uses a screening threshold of 150 ng/ml.&quot; As the amount was so low, Hingis appealed, arguing the likely cause was contamination rather than intentional ingestion. In January 2008, the ITF&#x27;s tribunal suspended Hingis from the sport for two years, effective from October 2007.

At the time of Hingis&#x27;s suspension, the ITF required an automatic two-year suspension for any players who tested positive for banned substances, regardless of extenuating circumstances such as contamination or extremely low detection levels. The ITF subsequently altered the suspension rules as a result of the Hingis case, allowing for future flexibility in cases of unintentional or unexplained ingestion.

====2008–09====

Having retired for the second time in 2007, Hingis played an exhibition match at the Liverpool International tournament on 13 June 2008. Although this event was a warm-up for Wimbledon, it was not part of the WTA Tour. In a rematch of their 1997 Wimbledon final, Hingis defeated Jana Novotná.

In 2009, Hingis took part in the British television dancing competition &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. She was the bookies&#x27; favourite for the competition, but went out in the first week after performing a waltz and a rumba.

====2010====

At the start of 2010, Hingis defeated former world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport, and hinted at a possible return to tennis. In February, she announced having committed to a full season with the World TeamTennis tour in 2010. She had previously played for World TeamTennis in 2005 to assist her first comeback. Sparking thoughts that she was trying to come back to the WTA Tour, she committed to playing at the Nottingham Masters. On 5 May 2010, it was announced that Hingis would reunite with her doubles partner Anna Kournikova. Kournikova was participating in competitive tennis for the first time in seven years, in the Invitational Ladies Doubles event at Wimbledon. Hingis also confirmed that she would play at the Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International championship in June 2010, preceding Wimbledon, before playing in the Manchester Masters after Wimbledon. Liverpool like the Nottingham and Manchester Masters are organised by her management company Northern Vision. At the Nottingham Masters, Hingis faced Michaëlla Krajicek (twice), Olga Savchuk and Monika Wejnert. Hingis won just once in the event, against Wejnert. After the Nottingham event, Billie Jean King stated that she believed that Hingis might return to the WTA Tour on the doubles circuit, after competing in the WTT.

====2011====

On 5 June 2011, Hingis, paired with Lindsay Davenport, won the Roland Garros Women&#x27;s Legends title, defeating Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotná in the final. Before facing Navratilova/Novotná, Hingis and Davenport won two round-robin matches in the tournament: first against Gigi Fernández/Natasha Zvereva, and then in the next match they prevailed over Andrea Temesvári/Sandrine Testud and 10:0 in the super tie-break.

On 3 July, Hingis partnering Lindsay Davenport won the Wimbledon Ladies&#x27; Invitation Doubles title, defeating Navratilova and Novotná in the final.
She also played for the New York Sportimes of the World TeamTennis Pro League in July 2011. She finished the season with the top winning percentage of any player competing in women&#x27;s singles.

====2012====

Hingis and Davenport successfully defended their Wimbledon Ladies&#x27; Invitation Doubles title in 2012, again beating Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotná in the final.

===Second return and doubles success (2013–2017)===

====2013: Coming out of retirement====

In April 2013, Hingis agreed to coach Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova; however, after a disagreement about how to prepare for tournaments they parted ways in June.

Hingis won the Ladies&#x27; Invitation Doubles for a third year in a row at Wimbledon, again with Davenport. They beat Jana Novotná and Barbara Schett in the final. Hingis was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in July 2013, and in the same month, announced that she was coming out of retirement to play a doubles tournament, with Daniela Hantuchová as her partner, in Carlsbad, California. She was accepted as a wildcard entry. She also played doubles in Toronto, Cincinnati, New Haven, and the US Open.

====2014: US Open doubles finalist====

Hingis helped Sabine Lisicki during the Australian Open. She participated in Champions Tennis League India to boost tennis in the country.

Hingis returned to the WTA Tour at Indian Wells, partnering Lisicki in the doubles. They lost in the first round to three-time Grand Slam finalists Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua. At the Miami Open, Hingis and Lisicki reached the finals of the tournament and then defeated Makarova and Vesnina in straight sets, marking Hingis&#x27;s first title since she won the Qatar Ladies Open in 2007 and her first Premier Mandatory doubles title since winning the 2001 title in Moscow. This was also her third win in Miami, having won her last title there in 1999.

Hingis reached the final at Eastbourne with Pennetta where they lost to Chan Hao-ching and Chan Yung-jan of Taiwan. At the Wimbledon Championships, she reached the quarterfinals with partner Bruno Soares in mixed doubles, where they lost to Daniel Nestor and Kristina Mladenovic in straight sets.

Entering as an unseeded team at the US Open, Hingis and Pennetta reached the final, without losing a set in any of their matches. In the final they lost to Makarova and Vesnina in three sets.

At the latter end of the season, Hingis and Flavia Pennetta won two titles. At the tournament in Wuhan, they beat Cara Black and Caroline Garcia to take the title; in Moscow they beat Caroline Garcia and Arantxa Parra Santonja.

====2015: Five major doubles titles====
In her first tournament of the year in Brisbane, Hingis and partner Sabine Lisicki didn&#x27;t drop a set en route to the title, beating Caroline Garcia and Katarina Srebotnik in straight sets in the final. Hingis played at the Australian Open with Flavia Pennetta, as the fourth seeds, but lost in the third round. However, Hingis paired with Leander Paes in the mixed doubles to win the title. The win was her first in a major event since capturing the mixed-doubles crown at the 2006 Australian Open.

After early exits with Pennetta at the Dubai Tennis Championships and Qatar Ladies Open, Hingis then partnered with Indian player Sania Mirza; they won the first 20 sets they contested, subsequently winning back-to-back titles in two WTA Premier Mandatory events: the Indian Wells Open and the Miami Open, also winning afterwise the Family Circle Cup. They were defeated in the first round in Stuttgart. At the Madrid Open they lost in the quarterfinals to Australian Open champions Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Lucie Šafářová 11–9 in the super tie-break. They reached the quarterfinals of the French Open, losing again to Mattek-Sands and Šafářová, this time in straight sets.

Hingis made a comeback in Fed Cup after a 17-year absence. She was scheduled to play doubles only, but then decided to try another comeback in singles by playing in the Fed Cup tie for Switzerland. She drew Agnieszka Radwańska in the first rubber and was defeated in two sets in her first official tour match since 2007. She lost her second singles rubber too, defeated by Urszula Radwańska in three sets, having been a set and a double break up.

On 11 July 2015, Hingis and Mirza beat Makarova and Vesnina in three tight sets, recovering from 5–2 down in the third to win the women&#x27;s doubles tournament at Wimbledon. The win gave Hingis her first Grand Slam in women&#x27;s doubles since the 2002 Australian Open. The following day, Hingis then won the mixed doubles final, partnering with Leander Paes, to defeat Alexander Peya and Tímea Babos in straight sets.

After two semifinal losses in Toronto and Cincinnati, Hingis won the mixed doubles title at the US Open on 12 September, partnering Paes, defeating Sam Querrey and Bethanie Mattek-Sands in three sets. The following day, Hingis and Mirza beat Casey Dellacqua and Yaroslava Shvedova in straight sets to win the doubles tournament. At the WTA Finals, they won all their group matches, including against Kops-Jones/Spears, Hlaváčková/Hradecká and Babos/Mladenovic. In the semifinals they beat the Chan sisters, and then they beat the Spanish team Muguruza/Suárez Navarro to win the title. That month Hingis participated at the Champions Tennis League in India, playing for the Hyderabad Aces team.

====2016: Mixed-doubles career Grand Slam====
In January, Hingis and Mirza won at Brisbane and Sydney. They then won the doubles tournament at the Australian Open, defeating Hlaváčková and Hradecká in the final, for their third consecutive Grand Slam title. Afterwards, Hingis said of their partnership: &quot;There&#x27;s not that many people who can match her in the forehand rallies and me on the backhand side and at the net. That&#x27;s what we try to do every match.&quot; In mixed doubles, Hingis and Paes lost in the quarterfinals to Mirza and Ivan Dodig.

In February, Hingis represented Switzerland in the Fed Cup tie against Germany alongside Belinda Bencic and Timea Bacsinszky. Switzerland beat Germany 3–2, with Hingis and Bencic clinching the doubles rubber. Switzerland advanced to the semifinals, where the team lost to the defending champions of the Czech Republic.

The Hingis-Mirza winning-streak record of 41 matches ended in the quarterfinals of the Qatar Ladies Open, where they lost to Kasatkina/Vesnina. Hingis and Mirza then proceeded to the Indian Wells Open to defend their title. However, they suffered a shock as the unseeded Vania King/Alla Kudryavtseva defeated them in straight sets.

At the Miami Open, Mirza and Hingis lost in the second round to Margarita Gasparyan and Monica Niculescu.

Hingis and Mirza started their clay season by reaching the finals of Porsche Tennis Grand Prix and Madrid Open, where they lost to Kristina Mladenovic and Caroline Garcia in both the tournaments. However, they won the Italian Open, defeating Makarova and Vesnina. At the French Open, they were upset by Czech pair Barbora Krejčíková and Kateřina Siniaková in the third round, which ended their 20 match winning streak in Grand Slam doubles tournaments.

Hingis won the French Open mixed doubles partnering Leander Paes. It is her first mixed doubles title at Roland Garros, and she completed the mixed-doubles career Grand Slam, becoming only the fourth woman ever to complete a career Grand Slam in both women&#x27;s doubles and mixed doubles.

Hingis qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, 20 years after her last Olympic appearance. She played doubles with Timea Bacsinszky and won the silver medal, losing to Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina in straight sets in the final. Hingis then played at the US Open with CoCo Vandeweghe, where they made the semifinals and lost to top seeds Garcia and Mladenovic. At the WTA Finals, Hingis reunited with Sania Mirza in what would be the partnership&#x27;s last tournament together; they defeated the Chan sisters in the quarterfinals but then lost to Makarova and Vesnina.

====2017: Three major doubles titles, back to world No. 1, final retirement====
Hingis continued to partner CoCo Vandeweghe in women&#x27;s doubles competition at the start of the season. Together they reached the quarterfinals of the Sydney International, losing to eventual champions Tímea Babos and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and the second round of the Australian Open, losing to the Australian duo of Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua. This capped a run of poor form, having gone 5–5 in tournaments since they made the semifinals at the US Open the previous season. As a result, Hingis split with Vandeweghe and entered a new partnership with Taiwan&#x27;s Chan Yung-jan, who herself had just split with her sister Hao-ching. In the mixed doubles competition at the Australian Open, Hingis reached the quarterfinals with Leander Paes before losing to another Australian duo, Samantha Stosur and Sam Groth in straight sets.

In preparation for the upcoming Fed Cup quarterfinal match between Switzerland and France, Hingis partnered with Belinda Bencic to defend her St. Petersburg title. The pair lost in the first round to Gabriela Dabrowski and Michaëlla Krajicek. In the Fed Cup quarterfinal match, Hingis instead paired up with Timea Bacsinszky and won their doubles match against Amandine Hesse and Kristina Mladenovic, helping the team to a 4–1 victory to advance to the semifinals.

In the first two tournaments of their new partnership, Hingis and Chan suffered some &quot;tough&quot; losses. They fell to Olga Savchuk and Yaroslava Shvedova in the semifinals of the Qatar Open and to Andrea Hlaváčková and Peng Shuai in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the Dubai Tennis Championships. However, they immediately rebounded by winning their first title together at the Indian Wells Open, defeating Hingis&#x27;s old partner Sania Mirza with Barbora Strýcová in the quarterfinals, top seeded Mattek-Sands and Šafářová in the semifinals, and Czech pair Lucie Hradecká and Kateřina Siniaková in the final. They then reached the semifinals of the Miami Open, before losing to Mirza and Strýcová.

Hingis again sought to practice with a Swiss partner before the Fed Cup semifinal clash of Switzerland versus Belarus, and this time paired up with Bacsinszky to enter the inaugural Ladies Open Biel Bienne. Hingis and Bacsinszky reached the final, succumbing there to Hsieh Su-wei and Monica Niculescu. Despite winning her doubles rubber with Bacsinszky in the Fed Cup semifinal tie, Switzerland would ultimately lose 2–3. Switzerland had been seeking to reach its first final since Hingis had spearheaded the team to a narrow defeat to Spain in 1998.

In the clay-court season, Hingis and Chan continued their good form to win back-to-back titles at the Madrid and Italian Opens, defeating Tímea Babos and Andrea Hlaváčková and Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina respectively, in the finals of each event. Hingis&#x27;s victory in Madrid was her 100th WTA career title. This success marked the pair as one of the pre-tournament favorites to win the French Open. Hingis and Chan reached the semifinals, where their 12 match winning streak was ended by eventual champions Mattek-Sands and Šafářová. Hingis and Paes lost in the opening round of the mixed doubles competition to Katarina Srebotnik and Raven Klaasen in a super tiebreak.

Hingis and Chan again won back-to-back titles, this time at the Mallorca Open and the Eastbourne International. At Mallorca, they won the title by walkover after Jelena Janković and Anastasija Sevastova withdrew from the title match owing to an injury sustained by Sevastova in the singles competition. At Eastbourne, they won after defeating Barty and Dellacqua in the final. However, like the French Open two months previous, Hingis and Chan could not replicate the success at Grand Slam level: losing at the quarterfinal stage to Grönefeld and Peschke at Wimbledon. In the mixed doubles competition, Hingis paired up with new partner Great Britain&#x27;s Jamie Murray after splitting from Leander Paes. As top seeds they reached the final without losing a set, before defeating defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen in the championship match.

Hingis and Chan next played at the Canadian Open, where the German-Czech pair of Grönefeld and Peschke defeated them for the second tournament in a row in the quarterfinals. However, not to be deterred, a week later at the Cincinnati Open they produced another winning run and defeated Hsieh and Niculescu in the final to capture their next title together. On 14 August, Hingis and Chan became one of the first teams to qualify for the doubles competition at the year-end WTA Finals.

At the US Open, Hingis emerged victorious from both the women&#x27;s and the mixed doubles competition. Jamie Murray and she defeated Chan Hao-ching and Michael Venus in the final to capture their second consecutive title together and remain undefeated as a pair. Then, less than 24 hours later with Chan, they defeated Hradecká and Siniaková in the final to win their first major title together. In total, this was Hingis&#x27;s 25th Grand Slam title across all disciplines.

Hingis and Chan extended their winning run to 18 matches in China by winning their third and fourth straight titles: the Wuhan and China Opens. In Wuhan, they defeated Shuko Aoyama and Yang Zhaoxuan in the final. With this win, Hingis ascended to the No. 1 ranking on 2 October for the 67th week in her career. In Beijing, they defeated Babos and Hlaváčková.

Hingis announced her retirement at the WTA Finals in Singapore in October 2017.

==Playing style==

Hingis was an all-court player who possessed an intelligent, crafty game. Hingis compensated for her lack of power with superior movement, anticipation, finesse, point construction, shot selection, and knowledge of the geometry of the court. Hingis used a semi-western grip for her forehand, allowing her to create sharp angles and dictate play. Her two-handed backhand was her most effective groundstroke, and was used to redirect power down the line. She could also hit her backhand one-handed with slice, and would use this shot to break up the pace of rallies. Her serve was not particularly powerful, and she rarely served aces, but was reliable, and she was proficient at defending her serve. Although her serve had been recorded as high as , her first serve was typically delivered at , and her second serve speed averaged . She was one of the most effective returners on the WTA tour, positioning herself on the baseline to return first serves, and her superior sense of anticipation allowed her to read serves effectively. Due to her doubles experience, Hingis was one of the most effective players at the net on the WTA tour, possessing an almost complete repertoire of shots at the net, and she would frequently choose to finish points off at the net.

<doc id="19048" wikidata="Q11423" url="?curid=19048" title="Mass">
<text>Mass is an intrinsic property of a body. It was traditionally believed to be related to the quantity of matter in a body, until the discovery of the atom and particle physics. It was found that different atoms and different elementary particles, theoretically with the same amount of matter, have nonetheless different masses. Mass in modern physics has multiple definitions which are conceptually distinct, but physically equivalent. Mass can be experimentally defined as a measure of the body&#x27;s inertia, meaning the resistance to acceleration (change of velocity) when a net force is applied. The object&#x27;s mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies.

The SI base unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). In physics, mass is not the same as weight, even though mass is often determined by measuring the object&#x27;s weight using a spring scale, rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses. An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass. This is because weight is a force, while mass is the property that (along with gravity) determines the strength of this force.

In the Standard Model of physics, the mass of elementary particles is believed to be a result of their coupling with the Higgs boson in what is known as the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism.

== Phenomena ==
There are several distinct phenomena that can be used to measure mass. Although some theorists have speculated that some of these phenomena could be independent of each other, current experiments have found no difference in results regardless of how it is measured:
* &quot;Inertial mass&quot; measures an object&#x27;s resistance to being accelerated by a force (represented by the relationship ).
* &quot;Active gravitational mass&quot; determines the strength of the gravitational field generated by an object.
* &quot;Passive gravitational mass&quot; measures the gravitational force exerted on an object in a known gravitational field.

The mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied force. The inertia and the inertial mass describe this property of physical bodies at the qualitative and quantitative level respectively. According to Newton&#x27;s second law of motion, if a body of fixed mass &quot;m&quot; is subjected to a single force &quot;F&quot;, its acceleration &quot;a&quot; is given by &quot;F&quot;/&quot;m&quot;. A body&#x27;s mass also determines the degree to which it generates and is affected by a gravitational field. If a first body of mass &quot;m&quot;A is placed at a distance &quot;r&quot; (center of mass to center of mass) from a second body of mass &quot;m&quot;B, each body is subject to an attractive force , where is the &quot;universal gravitational constant&quot;. This is sometimes referred to as gravitational mass. Repeated experiments since the 17th century have demonstrated that inertial and gravitational mass are identical; since 1915, this observation has been incorporated &quot;a priori&quot; in the equivalence principle of general relativity.

== Units of mass ==

The International System of Units (SI) unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). The kilogram is 1000 grams (g), and was first defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the melting point of ice. However, because precise measurement of a cubic decimetre of water at the specified temperature and pressure was difficult, in 1889 the kilogram was redefined as the mass of a metal object, and thus became independent of the metre and the properties of water, this being a copper prototype of the grave in 1793, the platinum Kilogramme des Archives in 1799, and the platinum–iridium International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) in 1889.

However, the mass of the IPK and its national copies have been found to drift over time. The re-definition of the kilogram and several other units came into effect on 20 May 2019, following a final vote by the CGPM in November 2018. The new definition uses only invariant quantities of nature: the speed of light, the caesium hyperfine frequency, the Planck constant and the elementary charge.

Non-SI units accepted for use with SI units include:
* the tonne (t) (or &quot;metric ton&quot;), equal to 1000 kg
* the electronvolt (eV), a unit of energy, used to express mass in units of eV/&quot;c&quot;2 through mass–energy equivalence
* the dalton (Da), equal to 1/12 of the mass of a free carbon-12 atom, approximately .

Outside the SI system, other units of mass include:
* the slug (sl), an Imperial unit of mass (about 14.6 kg)
* the pound (lb), a unit of mass (about 0.45 kg), which is used alongside the similarly named pound (force) (about 4.5 N), a unit of force
* the Planck mass (about ), a quantity derived from fundamental constants
* the solar mass (), defined as the mass of the Sun, primarily used in astronomy to compare large masses such as stars or galaxies (≈ )
* the mass of a particle, as identified with its inverse Compton wavelength ()
* the mass of a star or black hole, as identified with its Schwarzschild radius ().

=== History of units of mass ===
== Definitions ==

In physical science, one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven different aspects of &quot;mass&quot;, or seven physical notions that involve the concept of &quot;mass&quot;. Every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be proportional, and in some cases equal, and this proportionality gives rise to the abstract concept of mass. There are a number of ways mass can be measured or operationally defined:
* Inertial mass is a measure of an object&#x27;s resistance to acceleration when a force is applied. It is determined by applying a force to an object and measuring the acceleration that results from that force. An object with small inertial mass will accelerate more than an object with large inertial mass when acted upon by the same force. One says the body of greater mass has greater inertia.
* Active gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object&#x27;s gravitational flux (gravitational flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface). Gravitational field can be measured by allowing a small &quot;test object&quot; to fall freely and measuring its free-fall acceleration. For example, an object in free-fall near the Moon is subject to a smaller gravitational field, and hence accelerates more slowly, than the same object would if it were in free-fall near the Earth. The gravitational field near the Moon is weaker because the Moon has less active gravitational mass.
* Passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object&#x27;s interaction with a gravitational field. Passive gravitational mass is determined by dividing an object&#x27;s weight by its free-fall acceleration. Two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same acceleration; however, the object with a smaller passive gravitational mass will experience a smaller force (less weight) than the object with a larger passive gravitational mass.
* According to relativity, mass is nothing else than the rest energy of a system of particles, meaning the energy of that system in a reference frame where it has zero momentum. Mass can be converted into other forms of energy according to the principle of mass–energy equivalence. This equivalence is exemplified in a large number of physical processes including pair production, beta decay and nuclear fusion. Pair production and nuclear fusion are processes in which measurable amounts of mass are converted to kinetic energy or vice versa.
* Curvature of spacetime is a relativistic manifestation of the existence of mass. Such curvature is extremely weak and difficult to measure. For this reason, curvature was not discovered until after it was predicted by Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity. Extremely precise atomic clocks on the surface of the Earth, for example, are found to measure less time (run slower) when compared to similar clocks in space. This difference in elapsed time is a form of curvature called gravitational time dilation. Other forms of curvature have been measured using the Gravity Probe B satellite.
* Quantum mass manifests itself as a difference between an object&#x27;s quantum frequency and its wave number. The quantum mass of a particle is proportional to the inverse Compton wavelength and can be determined through various forms of spectroscopy. In relativistic quantum mechanics, mass is one of the irreducible representation labels of the Poincaré group.

=== Weight vs. mass ===
In everyday usage, mass and &quot;weight&quot; are often used interchangeably. For instance, a person&#x27;s weight may be stated as 75 kg. In a constant gravitational field, the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, and it is unproblematic to use the same unit for both concepts. But because of slight differences in the strength of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field at different places, the distinction becomes important for measurements with a precision better than a few percent, and for places far from the surface of the Earth, such as in space or on other planets. Conceptually, &quot;mass&quot; (measured in kilograms) refers to an intrinsic property of an object, whereas &quot;weight&quot; (measured in newtons) measures an object&#x27;s resistance to deviating from its current course of free fall, which can be influenced by the nearby gravitational field. No matter how strong the gravitational field, objects in free fall are weightless, though they still have mass.

The force known as &quot;weight&quot; is proportional to mass and acceleration in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall. For example, when a body is at rest in a gravitational field (rather than in free fall), it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the Earth or the Moon. This force keeps the object from going into free fall. Weight is the opposing force in such circumstances and is thus determined by the acceleration of free fall. On the surface of the Earth, for example, an object with a mass of 50 kilograms weighs 491 newtons, which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall. By contrast, on the surface of the Moon, the same object still has a mass of 50 kilograms but weighs only 81.5 newtons, because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon. Restated in mathematical terms, on the surface of the Earth, the weight &quot;W&quot; of an object is related to its mass &quot;m&quot; by , where is the acceleration due to Earth&#x27;s gravitational field, (expressed as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object).

For other situations, such as when objects are subjected to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface, the weight force is proportional to the mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall, which is called the proper acceleration. Through such mechanisms, objects in elevators, vehicles, centrifuges, and the like, may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects, resulting from planetary surfaces. In such cases, the generalized equation for weight &quot;W&quot; of an object is related to its mass &quot;m&quot; by the equation , where &quot;a&quot; is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity. (Again, if gravity is the only influence, such as occurs when an object falls freely, its weight will be zero).

=== Inertial vs. gravitational mass ===

Although inertial mass, passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct, no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them. In classical mechanics, Newton&#x27;s third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be identical (or at least proportional), but the classical theory offers no compelling reason why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass. That it does is merely an empirical fact.

Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity starting with the assumption that the inertial and passive gravitational masses are the same. This is known as the equivalence principle.

The particular equivalence often referred to as the &quot;Galilean equivalence principle&quot; or the &quot;weak equivalence principle&quot; has the most important consequence for freely falling objects. Suppose an object has inertial and gravitational masses &quot;m&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, respectively. If the only force acting on the object comes from a gravitational field &quot;g&quot;, the force on the object is:
: formula_1

Given this force, the acceleration of the object can be determined by Newton&#x27;s second law:
: formula_2

Putting these together, the gravitational acceleration is given by:
: formula_3

This says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is equal to some constant &quot;K&quot; if and only if all objects fall at the same rate in a given gravitational field. This phenomenon is referred to as the &quot;universality of free-fall&quot;. In addition, the constant &quot;K&quot; can be taken as 1 by defining our units appropriately.

The first experiments demonstrating the universality of free-fall were—according to scientific &#x27;folklore&#x27;—conducted by Galileo obtained by dropping objects from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This is most likely apocryphal: he is more likely to have performed his experiments with balls rolling down nearly frictionless inclined planes to slow the motion and increase the timing accuracy. Increasingly precise experiments have been performed, such as those performed by Loránd Eötvös, using the torsion balance pendulum, in 1889. , no deviation from universality, and thus from Galilean equivalence, has ever been found, at least to the precision 10−6. More precise experimental efforts are still being carried out.

The universality of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the only acting force. All other forces, especially friction and air resistance, must be absent or at least negligible. For example, if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on Earth, the feather will take much longer to reach the ground; the feather is not really in &quot;free&quot;-fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable to the downward force of gravity. On the other hand, if the experiment is performed in a vacuum, in which there is no air resistance, the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time (assuming the acceleration of both objects towards each other, and of the ground towards both objects, for its own part, is negligible). This can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump. It is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum, as David Scott did on the surface of the Moon during Apollo 15.

A stronger version of the equivalence principle, known as the &quot;Einstein equivalence principle&quot; or the &quot;strong equivalence principle&quot;, lies at the heart of the general theory of relativity. Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions of spacetime, it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field. Thus, the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by a gravitational field is a result of the object&#x27;s tendency to move in a straight line (in other words its inertia) and should therefore be a function of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field.

=== Origin ===
In theoretical physics, a mass generation mechanism is a theory which attempts to explain the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of physics. To date, a number of different models have been proposed which advocate different views of the origin of mass. The problem is complicated by the fact that the notion of mass is strongly related to the gravitational interaction but a theory of the latter has not been yet reconciled with the currently popular model of particle physics, known as the Standard Model.

== Pre-Newtonian concepts ==
=== Weight as an amount ===

The concept of is very old and predates recorded history. The concept of &quot;weight&quot; would incorporate &quot;amount&quot; and acquire a double meaning that was not clearly recognized as such.

Humans, at some early era, realized that the weight of a collection of similar objects was directly proportional to the number of objects in the collection:
: formula_4
where &quot;W&quot; is the weight of the collection of similar objects and &quot;n&quot; is the number of objects in the collection. Proportionality, by definition, implies that two values have a constant ratio:
: formula_5, or equivalently formula_6

An early use of this relationship is a balance scale, which balances the force of one object&#x27;s weight against the force of another object&#x27;s weight. The two sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational fields. Hence, if they have similar masses then their weights will also be similar. This allows the scale, by comparing weights, to also compare masses.

Consequently, historical weight standards were often defined in terms of amounts. The Romans, for example, used the carob seed (carat or siliqua) as a measurement standard. If an object&#x27;s weight was equivalent to 1728 carob seeds, then the object was said to weigh one Roman pound. If, on the other hand, the object&#x27;s weight was equivalent to 144 carob seeds then the object was said to weigh one Roman ounce (uncia). The Roman pound and ounce were both defined in terms of different sized collections of the same common mass standard, the carob seed. The ratio of a Roman ounce (144 carob seeds) to a Roman pound (1728 carob seeds) was:
: formula_7

=== Planetary motion ===

In 1600 AD, Johannes Kepler sought employment with Tycho Brahe, who had some of the most precise astronomical data available. Using Brahe&#x27;s precise observations of the planet Mars, Kepler spent the next five years developing his own method for characterizing planetary motion. In 1609, Johannes Kepler published his three laws of planetary motion, explaining how the planets orbit the Sun. In Kepler&#x27;s final planetary model, he described planetary orbits as following elliptical paths with the Sun at a focal point of the ellipse. Kepler discovered that the square of the orbital period of each planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit, or equivalently, that the ratio of these two values is constant for all planets in the Solar System.

On 25 August 1609, Galileo Galilei demonstrated his first telescope to a group of Venetian merchants, and in early January 1610, Galileo observed four dim objects near Jupiter, which he mistook for stars. However, after a few days of observation, Galileo realized that these &quot;stars&quot; were in fact orbiting Jupiter. These four objects (later named the Galilean moons in honor of their discoverer) were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit something other than the Earth or Sun. Galileo continued to observe these moons over the next eighteen months, and by the middle of 1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods.

=== Galilean free fall ===
Sometime prior to 1638, Galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of objects in free fall, attempting to characterize these motions. Galileo was not the first to investigate Earth&#x27;s gravitational field, nor was he the first to accurately describe its fundamental characteristics. However, Galileo&#x27;s reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would have a profound effect on future generations of scientists. It is unclear if these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept, or if they were real experiments performed by Galileo, but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and compelling. A biography by Galileo&#x27;s pupil Vincenzo Viviani stated that Galileo had dropped balls of the same material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. In support of this conclusion, Galileo had advanced the following theoretical argument: He asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of fall are tied by a string, does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive, or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body? The only convincing resolution to this question is that all bodies must fall at the same rate.

A later experiment was described in Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; published in 1638. One of Galileo&#x27;s fictional characters, Salviati, describes an experiment using a bronze ball and a wooden ramp. The wooden ramp was &quot;12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick&quot; with a straight, smooth, polished groove. The groove was lined with &quot;parchment, also smooth and polished as possible&quot;. And into this groove was placed &quot;a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball&quot;. The ramp was inclined at various angles to slow the acceleration enough so that the elapsed time could be measured. The ball was allowed to roll a known distance down the ramp, and the time taken for the ball to move the known distance was measured. The time was measured using a water clock described as follows:
:a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.

Galileo found that for an object in free fall, the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time:
: formula_8

Galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field have a constant acceleration, and Galileo&#x27;s contemporary, Johannes Kepler, had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence of the Sun&#x27;s gravitational mass. However, Galileo&#x27;s free fall motions and Kepler&#x27;s planetary motions remained distinct during Galileo&#x27;s lifetime.

=== Mass as distinct from weight ===
According to K. M. Browne: &quot;Kepler formed a [distinct] concept of mass (&#x27;amount of matter&#x27; (&quot;copia materiae&quot;)), but called it &#x27;weight&#x27; as did everyone at that time.&quot; Finally, in 1686, Newton gave this distinct concept its own name. In the first paragraph of &quot;Principia&quot;, Newton defined quantity of matter as “density and bulk conjunctly”, and mass as quantity of matter.

== Newtonian mass ==


Robert Hooke had published his concept of gravitational forces in 1674, stating that all celestial bodies have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own centers, and also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of their activity. He further stated that gravitational attraction increases by how much nearer the body wrought upon is to its own center. In correspondence with Isaac Newton from 1679 and 1680, Hooke conjectured that gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance between the two bodies. Hooke urged Newton, who was a pioneer in the development of calculus, to work through the mathematical details of Keplerian orbits to determine if Hooke&#x27;s hypothesis was correct. Newton&#x27;s own investigations verified that Hooke was correct, but due to personal differences between the two men, Newton chose not to reveal this to Hooke. Isaac Newton kept quiet about his discoveries until 1684, at which time he told a friend, Edmond Halley, that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits, but had misplaced the solution in his office. After being encouraged by Halley, Newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his findings. In November 1684, Isaac Newton sent a document to Edmund Halley, now lost but presumed to have been titled &quot;De motu corporum in gyrum&quot; (Latin for &quot;On the motion of bodies in an orbit&quot;). Halley presented Newton&#x27;s findings to the Royal Society of London, with a promise that a fuller presentation would follow. Newton later recorded his ideas in a three-book set, entitled &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (English: &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;). The first was received by the Royal Society on 28 April 1685–86; the second on 2 March 1686–87; and the third on 6 April 1686–87. The Royal Society published Newton&#x27;s entire collection at their own expense in May 1686–87.

Isaac Newton had bridged the gap between Kepler&#x27;s gravitational mass and Galileo&#x27;s gravitational acceleration, resulting in the discovery of the following relationship which governed both of these:
: formula_9

If is non-zero, the fraction is well-defined, which allows us to measure the inertial mass of &quot;m&quot;1. In this case, &quot;m&quot;2 is our &quot;reference&quot; object, and we can define its mass &quot;m&quot; as (say) 1 kilogram. Then we can measure the mass of any other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations.

Additionally, mass relates a body&#x27;s momentum p to its linear velocity v:
: formula_10,
and the body&#x27;s kinetic energy &quot;K&quot; to its velocity:
: formula_11.

The primary difficulty with Mach&#x27;s definition of mass is that it fails to take into account the potential energy (or binding energy) needed to bring two masses sufficiently close to one another to perform the measurement of mass. This is most vividly demonstrated by comparing the mass of the proton in the nucleus of deuterium, to the mass of the proton in free space (which is greater by about 0.239%—this is due to the binding energy of deuterium). Thus, for example, if the reference weight &quot;m&quot;2 is taken to be the mass of the neutron in free space, and the relative accelerations for the proton and neutron in deuterium are computed, then the above formula over-estimates the mass &quot;m&quot;1 (by 0.239%) for the proton in deuterium. At best, Mach&#x27;s formula can only be used to obtain ratios of masses, that is, as &quot;m&quot;1 / &quot;m&quot;2 =  / . An additional difficulty was pointed out by Henri Poincaré, which is that the measurement of instantaneous acceleration is impossible: unlike the measurement of time or distance, there is no way to measure acceleration with a single measurement; one must make multiple measurements (of position, time, etc.) and perform a computation to obtain the acceleration. Poincaré termed this to be an &quot;insurmountable flaw&quot; in the Mach definition of mass.

== Atomic masses ==
Typically, the mass of objects is measured in terms of the kilogram, which since 2019 is defined in terms of fundamental constants of nature. The mass of an atom or other particle can be compared more precisely and more conveniently to that of another atom, and thus scientists developed the dalton (also known as the unified atomic mass unit). By definition, 1 Da (one dalton) is exactly one-twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, and thus, a carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12 Da.

== In relativity ==

=== Special relativity ===

In some frameworks of special relativity, physicists have used different definitions of the term. In these frameworks, two kinds of mass are defined: rest mass (invariant mass), and relativistic mass (which increases with velocity). Rest mass is the Newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object. &quot;Relativistic mass&quot; is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided by &quot;c&quot;2. The two are related by the following equation:
: formula_12
where formula_13 is the Lorentz factor:
: formula_14

The invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames, while the relativistic mass depends on the observer&#x27;s frame of reference. In order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values do not change between observers, it is convenient to use rest mass. The rest mass of a body is also related to its energy &quot;E&quot; and the magnitude of its momentum p by the relativistic energy-momentum equation:
: formula_15

So long as the system is closed with respect to mass and energy, both kinds of mass are conserved in any given frame of reference. The conservation of mass holds even as some types of particles are converted to others. Matter particles (such as atoms) may be converted to non-matter particles (such as photons of light), but this does not affect the total amount of mass or energy. Although things like heat may not be matter, all types of energy still continue to exhibit mass. Thus, mass and energy do not change into one another in relativity; rather, both are names for the same thing, and neither mass nor energy &quot;appear&quot; without the other.

Both rest and relativistic mass can be expressed as an energy by applying the well-known relationship &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2, yielding rest energy and &quot;relativistic energy&quot; (total system energy) respectively:
: formula_16
: formula_17

The &quot;relativistic&quot; mass and energy concepts are related to their &quot;rest&quot; counterparts, but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in systems where there is a net momentum. Because the relativistic mass is proportional to the energy, it has gradually fallen into disuse among physicists. There is disagreement over whether the concept remains useful pedagogically.

In bound systems, the binding energy must often be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system, because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the time it is bound. The mass of the system changes in this process merely because the system was not closed during the binding process, so the energy escaped. For example, the binding energy of atomic nuclei is often lost in the form of gamma rays when the nuclei are formed, leaving nuclides which have less mass than the free particles (nucleons) of which they are composed.

Mass–energy equivalence also holds in macroscopic systems. For example, if one takes exactly one kilogram of ice, and applies heat, the mass of the resulting melt-water will be more than a kilogram: it will include the mass from the thermal energy (latent heat) used to melt the ice; this follows from the conservation of energy. This number is small but not negligible: about 3.7 nanograms. It is given by the latent heat of melting ice (334 kJ/kg) divided by the speed of light squared (&quot;c&quot;2 ≈ ).

=== General relativity ===
In general relativity, the equivalence principle is the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass. At the core of this assertion is Albert Einstein&#x27;s idea that the gravitational force as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the &quot;pseudo-force&quot; experienced by an observer in a non-inertial (i.e. accelerated) frame of reference.

However, it turns out that it is impossible to find an objective general definition for the concept of invariant mass in general relativity. At the core of the problem is the non-linearity of the Einstein field equations, making it impossible to write the gravitational field energy as part of the stress–energy tensor in a way that is invariant for all observers. For a given observer, this can be achieved by the stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor.

== In quantum physics ==

In classical mechanics, the inert mass of a particle appears in the Euler–Lagrange equation as a parameter &quot;m&quot;:
: formula_18

After quantization, replacing the position vector &quot;x&quot; with a wave function, the parameter &quot;m&quot; appears in the kinetic energy operator:
: formula_19

In the ostensibly covariant (relativistically invariant) Dirac equation, and in natural units, this becomes:
: formula_20
where the &quot;mass&quot; parameter &quot;m&quot; is now simply a constant associated with the quantum described by the wave function ψ.

In the Standard Model of particle physics as developed in the 1960s, this term arises from the coupling of the field ψ to an additional field Φ, the Higgs field. In the case of fermions, the Higgs mechanism results in the replacement of the term &quot;m&quot;ψ in the Lagrangian with formula_21. This shifts the explanandum of the value for the mass of each elementary particle to the value of the unknown coupling constant &quot;G&quot;ψ.

=== Tachyonic particles and imaginary (complex) mass ===
A tachyonic field, or simply tachyon, is a quantum field with an imaginary mass. Although tachyons (particles that move faster than light) are a purely hypothetical concept not generally believed to exist, fields with imaginary mass have come to play an important role in modern physics and are discussed in popular books on physics. Under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories—the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals (there is no violation of causality). While the &quot;field&quot; may have imaginary mass, any physical particles do not; the &quot;imaginary mass&quot; shows that the system becomes unstable, and sheds the instability by undergoing a type of phase transition called tachyon condensation (closely related to second order phase transitions) that results in symmetry breaking in current models of particle physics.

The term &quot;tachyon&quot; was coined by Gerald Feinberg in a 1967 paper, but it was soon realized that Feinberg&#x27;s model in fact did not allow for superluminal speeds. Instead, the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration:- any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons. This process is known as tachyon condensation. Well known examples include the condensation of the Higgs boson in particle physics, and ferromagnetism in condensed matter physics.

Although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass, the mass is not quantized. Rather, the scalar field is; even for tachyonic quantum fields, the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute (or anticommute), thus preserving causality. Therefore, information still does not propagate faster than light, and solutions grow exponentially, but not superluminally (there is no violation of causality). Tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons, to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared.

This is a special case of the general rule, where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part being their mass in the usual sense, and the imaginary part being the decay rate in natural units. However, in quantum field theory, a particle (a &quot;one-particle state&quot;) is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time; i.e., an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. An unstable particle is a state which is only approximately constant over time; If it exists long enough to be measured, it can be formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part. If both parts are of the same magnitude, this is interpreted as a resonance appearing in a scattering process rather than a particle, as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process. In the case of a tachyon, the real part of the mass is zero, and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it.

In a Lorentz invariant theory, the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles (sometimes called &quot;bradyons&quot; in discussions of tachyons) must also apply to tachyons. In particular the energy–momentum relation:
: formula_22
(where p is the relativistic momentum of the bradyon and m is its rest mass) should still apply, along with the formula for the total energy of a particle:
: formula_23
This equation shows that the total energy of a particle (bradyon or tachyon) contains a contribution from its rest mass (the &quot;rest mass–energy&quot;) and a contribution from its motion, the kinetic energy.
When &quot;v&quot; is larger than &quot;c&quot;, the denominator in the equation for the energy is &quot;imaginary&quot;, as the value under the radical is negative. Because the total energy must be real, the numerator must &quot;also&quot; be imaginary: i.e. the rest mass m must be imaginary, as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number.

<text>The markka (; ; sign: mk; ISO code: FIM), also known as the Finnish mark, was the currency of Finland from 1860 until 28 February 2002, when it ceased to be legal tender. The markka was divided into 100 pennies (; ), abbreviated as &quot;p&quot;. At the point of conversion, the rate was fixed at €1 = 5.94573 mk.

The markka was replaced by the euro (€), which had been introduced, in cash form, on 1 March 2002. This was after a transitional period of three years, when the euro was the official currency but only existed as &quot;book money&quot; outside of the monetary base. The dual circulation period, when both the markka and the euro had legal tender status, ended on 28 February 2002.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;markka&quot; was based on a medieval unit of weight. Both &quot;markka&quot; and &quot;penni&quot; are similar to words used in Germany for that country&#x27;s former currency, based on the same etymological roots as the Deutsche Mark and pfennig.

Although the word &quot;markka&quot; predates the currency by several centuries, the currency was established before being named &quot;markka&quot;. A competition was held for its name, and some of the other entries included &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;having a hundred parts&quot;), &quot; (apple) and &quot; (from &quot;&quot;, the Finnish name for Finland).

The Finnish language does not use plurals when referring to multiple markkaa, but partitive singular forms: &quot;10 markkaa&quot; and &quot;10 penniä&quot; (the nominative is &quot;penni&quot;). In Swedish, the singular and plural forms of &quot;mark&quot; and &quot;penni&quot; are the same.

===Nicknames===
When the euro replaced the markka, (, sometimes shortened to just ) became a new colloquial term for the old currency. The sometimes used &quot;old markka&quot; can be misleading, since it can also be used to refer to the pre-1963 markka. In Helsinki slang, the sum of a hundred markkaa was traditionally called a [hu.ge] (from Swedish for &quot;hundred&quot;). After the 1963 reform, this name was used for one new markka.

==History==


During its time as a grand duchy under the Russian Empire, Finland used the Russian rouble and the &quot;riksdaler&quot; of its former parent country Sweden as concurrent currencies until the currency redefinition in 1840. After this Finland used the Russian rouble as its sole currency for two decades.

The markka was introduced in 1860 by the Bank of Finland, replacing the Russian ruble at a rate of four markkaa to one ruble.

Senator Fabian Langenskiöld is called &quot;father of the markka&quot;. In late 1859, on Langenskiöld&#x27;s initiative the Senate of Finland made a proposition to the Emperor that banknotes of the Russian rouble would no longer be used for their face value in Finland, but instead for their real price, which would be defined at the stock market in St. Petersburg. The reason for this was instability caused by the Crimean War, which had caused the Bank of Finland to stop exchanging its rouble banknotes for silver. Finland asked the Emperor for permission for a currency of its own and got the permission on 4 April 1860, when Emperor Alexander II of Russia signed the &quot;Merciful announcement by his Imperial Majesty for a new currency for the Grand Duchy of Finland&quot;. The markka was taken into use in 1860, but its value was tied to the Russian rouble: one markka equalled one quarter of a rouble, but there was speculation in Russia that even that was too much of a value for the new currency.

Both Fabian Langenskiöld who acted as the head of the finance office of the Senate of Finland from 1858 to 1863 and his successor Johan Vilhelm Snellman have been called &quot;the father of the markka&quot;. The markka was taken into use in Langenskiöld&#x27;s time, but its separation from the Russian rouble fell to Snellman. In 1862 Langenskiöld had received acceptance from the Emperor for his plan to have the markka coins as Finland&#x27;s only legal tender and give the Bank of Finland the right to accept its banknotes for their face value. The implementation of this plan fell to Snellman after Langenskiöld&#x27;s death in summer 1863.

A loan was necessary for the birth of the markka, as accepting banknotes would only be possible if there was enough silver in the vault of the Bank of Finland. This loan was received from the powerful banker Carl Mayer von Rotschild. This was Finland&#x27;s first loan from the western finance market.

In 1865, the markka was separated from the ruble and tied to the value of silver, becoming an independent currency. From 1878 to 1915, Finland adopted the gold standard of the Latin Monetary Union.

In 1878 the markka was tied to a gold standard, and 20 markkaa corresponded to 6.45 grams of a mixture containing 900 per mille of pure gold. The markka was of equal value with the French franc, the Belgian franc, the Swiss franc and the Italian lira (and later also with other member states of the so-called Latin Monetary Union). The size, weight and gold content of these coins was equal regardless of the issuing country and in theory, they were also legal tender regardless of the issuing country, even though gold 10 and 20 markkaa coins were struck in so small amounts compared to the other corresponding European coins that no significant numbers of these coins ever wound up in central Europe.

Before World War I the legal tender in Finland was gold markka coins, of which quite few were actually in circulation. On the other hand, banknotes issued by the Bank of Finland were not legal tender. This meant that a creditor had to accept Finnish gold coins as payment, but was under no obligation to accept banknotes, even though these could be exchanged for gold coins. In practice however everyone also accepted payment in banknotes.

Up until World War I, the value of the markka fluctuated within +23%/−16% of its initial value, but with no trend. The markka suffered heavy inflation (91%) during 1914–18. Gaining independence in 1917, Finland returned to the gold standard from 1926 to 1931. While prices remained stable until 1940, the markka suffered heavy inflation (17% annually on average) during World War II and again in 1956–57 (11%). In 1963, in order to reset the inflation, the markka was redenominated and replaced by a &quot;new markka&quot; worth 100 old markkaa.

Finland joined the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1948. The value of the markka was pegged to the dollar at 320 mk = US$1, which became New 3.20 mk = US$1 in 1963 and devalued to 4.20 mk = US$1 in 1967. After the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971, a basket of currencies became the new reference. Inflation was high (over 5%) during 1971–85. Occasionally, devaluation was used, 60% in total between 1975 and 1990, allowing the currency to more closely follow the depreciating US dollar than the rising German mark. The paper industry, which mainly traded in US dollars, was often blamed for demanding these devaluations to boost their exports. Various economic controls were removed and the market was gradually liberalized throughout the 1980s and the 1990s.

The monetary policy called &quot;strong markka policy&quot; (&quot;vahvan markan politiikka&quot;) was a characteristic feature of the 1980s and early 1990s. The main architect of this policy was President Mauno Koivisto, who opposed floating the currency and devaluations. As a result, the nominal value of the markka was extremely high, and in the year 1990, Finland was nominally the most expensive country in the world according to OECD&#x27;s Purchasing Power Parities report.

Koivisto&#x27;s policy was maintained only briefly after Esko Aho was elected Prime Minister. In 1991, the markka was pegged to the currency basket ECU, but the peg had to be withdrawn after two months with a devaluation of 12%. In 1992, Finland was hit by a severe recession, the early 1990s depression in Finland. It was caused by several factors, the most severe being the incurring of debt, as the 1980s economic boom was based on debt. Also, the Soviet Union had collapsed, which brought an end to bilateral trade, and existing trade connections were severed. The most important source of export revenue, Western markets, were also depressed during the same time, in part due to the war in Kuwait. As a result, by some opinions years overdue, the artificial fixed exchange rate was abandoned and the markka was floated. Its value immediately decreased 13% and the inflated nominal prices converged towards German levels. In total, the value of the markka had decreased 40% as a result of the recession. Also, as a result, several entrepreneurs who had borrowed money denominated in foreign currency suddenly faced insurmountable debt.

Inflation was low during the markka&#x27;s independent existence as a floating currency (1992–1999): 1.3% annually on average. The markka was added into the ERM system in 1996 and then became a fraction of the euro in 1999, with physical euro money arriving later in 2002. It has been speculated that if Finland had not joined the euro, market fluctuations such as the dot-com bubble would have reflected as wild fluctuations in the price of the markka. Nokia, formerly traded in markka, was in 2000 the European company with the highest market capitalization.

==Coins==

=== First markka ===

When the markka was introduced, coins were minted in copper (1, 5 and 10 penniä), silver (25p and 50p, 1 mk and 2 mk) and gold (10 mk and 20 mk). The first markka coins were designed by the Russian artist Alexander Fadeyev. The first coin stamps for the markka coins were carved by the carver of the Mint of Finland Lea Ahlborn in 1863. The Mint of Finland started operating right after its premises were completed in Katajanokka, Helsinki in autumn 1864, and the first silver markka coins were struck on 15 October 1864.

When the markka was tied to silver in 1865, markka coins were struck for &quot;94.48 pieces for a pound of clear silver&quot;, meaning that a pound of silver gave 94.48 markka coins. &quot;Full-value&quot; coins of 1 and 2 markkaa were struck from a mixture containing 868 per mille of silver. The mixture used for penni coins contained 750 per mille of silver.

When the markka was tied to gold in 1877, coins of 10 and 20 markkaa were struck in gold. They were made from a mixture containing 90% of gold and 10% of copper. The gold 20 markkaa coin (6.45 g) contained 5 and 25/31 grams of pure gold, the rest was copper. The 10 markkaa coin contained gold of half of this amount, i.e. 2 and 28/31 grams of pure gold.

After the First World War, silver and gold issues were ceased and cupro-nickel 25p and 50p and 1 mk coins were introduced in 1921, followed by aluminium-bronze 5 mk, 10 mk and 20 mk between 1928 and 1931. During the Second World War, copper replaced cupro-nickel in the 25p and 50p and 1 mk, followed by an issue of iron 10p, 25p and 50p and 1 mk. This period also saw the issue of holed 5p and 10p coins.
All coins below 1 markka had ceased to be produced by 1948. In 1952, a new coinage was introduced, with smaller iron (later nickel-plated) 1 mk and 5 mk coins alongside aluminium-bronze 10 mk, 20 mk and 50 mk coins and (from 1956) silver 100 mk and 200 mk denominations. This coinage continued to be issued until the introduction of the new markka in 1963.

=== Second markka ===
The old coins and banknotes were exchanged to new ones at 100:1 rate.

==== First series ====
The new markka coinage consisted initially of six denominations: 1 (bronze, later aluminium), 5 (bronze, later aluminium), 10 (aluminium-bronze, later aluminium), 20 and 50 penniä (aluminium-bronze) and 1 markka (silver, later cupro-nickel). The design of new coins (1963) was identical to those of the last issue of the old markka but with new denominations (i.e. 1 penni instead of 1 markka, etc.).

From 1972, aluminium-bronze 5 mk were also issued.

==== Second series ====

The last series of Finnish markka coins included five coins (listed with final euro values, rounded to the nearest cent):
* 10p (cupronickel) – a honeycomb on the reverse and a lily of the valley flower on the obverse = €0.02
* 50p (cupronickel) – haircap moss on the reverse and a bear on the obverse = €0.08
* 1 mk (aluminum-bronze) – the Finnish coat of arms on the reverse = €0.17
* 5 mk (aluminum-bronze) – a lily pad leaf and a dragonfly on the reverse and a Saimaa seal on the obverse = €0.84
* 10 mk (bimetallic coin, aluminum-bronze centre and cupronickel ring) – rowan tree branches and berries on the reverse and a wood grouse on the obverse = €1.68

== Banknotes ==
This section covers the last design series of the Finnish markka, designed in the 1980s by and Finnish designer Erik Bruun and issued in 1986.
In this final banknote series, the Bank of Finland used a photograph of Väinö Linna on the 20 mk note without permission from copyright holders. This was only revealed after several million notes were in use. The Bank paid 100,000 mk (€17,000) compensation to the rights holders.

The second-to-last banknote design series, designed by Tapio Wirkkala, was introduced in 1955 and revised in the reform of 1963. It was the first series to depict actual specific persons rather than allegorical figures. These included Juho Kusti Paasikivi on the 10 mk, K. J. Ståhlberg on the 50 mk, J. V. Snellman on the 100 mk and, controversially, Urho Kekkonen on the 500 mk, added in 1975 to commemorate the president&#x27;s 75th birthday. Unlike Erik Bruun&#x27;s series, this series did not depict any other real-life subjects, but only abstract ornaments in addition to the depictions of people. A popular joke at the time was to cover Paasikivi&#x27;s face except for his ear and back of the head on the 10 mk note, ending up with something resembling a mouse, said to be the only animal illustration in the entire series.

The still-older notes, designed by Eliel Saarinen, were introduced in 1922. They also depicted people, but these were generic men and women, and did not represent any specific individuals. The fact that these men and women were depicted nude caused a minor controversy at the time.

== Euro banknotes ==
By the end of 2001, Finland was a relatively cashless society. Most transactions were paid either using the 100 mk banknote or by debit card. There were 4 million banknotes apiece of the 500 mk and 1,000 mk denomination banknotes for a country with a population of over 5 million people. There were about 19 banknotes per individual of the smaller denomination, adding up to €241 per inhabitant. For the introduction of the euro, ECB produced €8,020 million in banknotes before the changeover.

During the first weeks of 2002, Finland&#x27;s replacement of previous national banknotes with euro banknotes was among the fastest in the euro area. Of the cash payments, three-fourths were paid in euro already at the end of the first changeover week. Coins and banknotes that were legal tender at the time of the markka&#x27;s retirement could be exchanged for euros until 29 February 2012. Today, the only value that markka coins and banknotes have is their value as collectibles.

<doc id="19051" wikidata="Q731" url="?curid=19051" title="Manganese">
<text>Manganese is a chemical element; it has symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is a hard, brittle, silvery metal, often found in minerals in combination with iron. Manganese was first isolated in the 1770s. It is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels. It improves strength, workability, and resistance to wear. Manganese oxide is used as an oxidising agent; as a rubber additive; and in glass making, fertilisers, and ceramics. Manganese sulfate can be used as a fungicide.

Manganese is also an essential human dietary element, important in macronutrient metabolism, bone formation, and free radical defense systems. It is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes. It is found mostly in the bones, but also the liver, kidneys, and brain. In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.

It is familiar in the laboratory in the form of the deep violet salt potassium permanganate. It occurs at the active sites in some enzymes. Of particular interest is the use of a Mn-O cluster, the oxygen-evolving complex, in the production of oxygen by plants.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Manganese is a silvery-gray metal that resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese and its common ions are paramagnetic. Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes (&quot;rusts&quot;) like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.

===Isotopes===

Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable isotope, 55Mn. Several radioisotopes have been isolated and described, ranging in atomic weight from 46 u (46Mn) to 72 u (72Mn). The most stable are 53Mn with a half-life of 3.7 million years, 54Mn with a half-life of 312.2 days, and 52Mn with a half-life of 5.591 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than three hours, and the majority of less than one minute. The primary decay mode in isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope, 55Mn, is electron capture and the primary mode in heavier isotopes is beta decay. Manganese also has three meta states.

Manganese is part of the iron group of elements, which are thought to be synthesized in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion. 53Mn decays to 53Cr with a half-life of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, 53Mn is relatively rare, produced by cosmic rays impact on iron. Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the Solar System. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio, which indicate that Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from &quot;in situ&quot; decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, 53Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the Solar System.

===Allotropes===

Four allotropes (structural forms) of solid manganese are known, labeled α, β, γ and δ, and occurring at successively higher temperatures. All are metallic, stable at standard pressure, and have a cubic crystal lattice, but they vary widely in their atomic structures.

Alpha manganese (α-Mn) is the equilibrium phase at room temperature. It has a body-centered cubic lattice and is unusual among elemental metals in having a very complex unit cell, with 58 atoms per cell (29 atoms per primitive unit cell) in four different types of site. It is paramagnetic at room temperature and antiferromagnetic at temperatures below .
Beta manganese (β-Mn) forms when heated above the transition temperature of . It has a primitive cubic structure with 20 atoms per unit cell at two types of sites, which is as complex as that of any other elemental metal. It is easily obtained as a metastable phase at room temperature by rapid quenching. It does not show magnetic ordering, remaining paramagnetic down to the lowest temperature measured (1.1 K).

Gamma manganese (γ-Mn) forms when heated above . It has a simple face-centered cubic structure (four atoms per unit cell). When quenched to room temperature it converts to β-Mn, but it can be stabilized at room temperature by alloying it with at least 5 percent of other elements (such as C, Fe, Ni, Cu, Pd or Au), and these solute-stabilized alloys distort into a face-centered tetragonal structure.

Delta manganese (δ-Mn) forms when heated above and is stable up to the manganese melting point of . It has a body-centered cubic structure (two atoms per cubic unit cell).

==Chemical compounds==
Common oxidation states of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, although all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Manganese in oxidation state +7 is represented by salts of the intensely purple permanganate anion . Potassium permanganate is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it is used as a topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.

Aside from various permanganate salts, Mn(VII) is represented by the unstable, volatile derivative Mn2O7. Oxyhalides (MnO3F and MnO3Cl) are powerful oxidizing agents. The most prominent example of Mn in the +6 oxidation state is the green anion manganate, [MnO4]2−. Manganate salts are intermediates in the extraction of manganese from its ores. Compounds with oxidation states +5 are somewhat elusive, and often found associated to an oxide (O2−) or nitride (N3−) ligand. One example is the blue anion hypomanganate [MnO4]3−.

Mn(IV) is somewhat enigmatic because it is common in nature but far rarer in synthetic chemistry. The most common Mn ore, pyrolusite, is MnO2. It is the dark brown pigment of many cave drawings but is also a common ingredient in dry cell batteries. Complexes of Mn(IV) are well known, but they require elaborate ligands. Mn(IV)-OH complexes are an intermediate in some enzymes, including the oxygen evolving center (OEC) in plants.

Simple derivatives Mn3+ are rarely encountered but can be stabilized by suitably basic ligands. Manganese(III) acetate is an oxidant useful in organic synthesis. Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the Jahn-Teller effect. 
A particularly common oxidation state for manganese in aqueous solution is +2, which has a pale pink color. Many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as the aquo complexes derived from manganese(II) sulfate (MnSO4) and manganese(II) chloride (MnCl2). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite (manganese(II) carbonate). Manganese(II) commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese(II). There are no spin-allowed d–d transitions in manganese(II), which explain its faint color.
===Organomanganese compounds===

Manganese forms a large variety of organometallic derivatives, i.e., compounds with Mn-C bonds. The organometallic derivatives include numerous examples of Mn in its lower oxidation states, i.e. Mn(−III) up through Mn(I). This area of organometallic chemistry is attractive because Mn is inexpensive and of relatively low toxicity.

Of greatest commercial interest is &quot;MMT&quot;, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, which is used as an anti-knock compound added to gasoline (petrol) in some countries. It features Mn(I). Consistent with other aspects of Mn(II) chemistry, manganocene () is high-spin. In contrast, its neighboring metal iron forms an air-stable, low-spin derivative in the form of ferrocene (). When conducted under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide, reduction of Mn(II) salts gives dimanganese decacarbonyl , an orange and volatile solid. The air-stability of this Mn(0) compound (and its many derivatives) reflects the powerful electron-acceptor properties of carbon monoxide. Many alkene complexes and alkyne complexes are derived from .

In Mn(CH3)2(dmpe)2, Mn(II) is low spin, which contrasts with the high spin character of its precursor, MnBr2(dmpe)2 (dmpe = (CH3)2PCH2CH2P(CH3)2). Polyalkyl and polyaryl derivatives of manganese often exist in higher oxidation states, reflecting the electron-releasing properties of alkyl and aryl ligands. One example is [Mn(CH3)6]2−.

==History==
The origin of the name manganese is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals were identified from the regions of the Magnetes (either Magnesia, located within modern Greece, or Magnesia ad Sipylum, located within modern Turkey). They were both called &quot;magnes&quot; from their place of origin, but were considered to differ in sex. The male &quot;magnes&quot; attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female &quot;magnes&quot; ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This female &quot;magnes&quot; was later called &quot;magnesia&quot;, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called &quot;manganesum&quot; (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a &quot;magnesia nigra&quot; (the black ore) from &quot;magnesia alba&quot; (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia nigra &quot;manganesa&quot;, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as &quot;manganese&quot; (). The name &quot;magnesia&quot; eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.

Manganese dioxide, which is abundant in nature, has long been used as a pigment. The cave paintings in Gargas that are 30,000 to 24,000 years old are made from the mineral form of MnO2 pigments.

Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers, either to add to, or remove, color from glass. Use as &quot;glassmakers soap&quot; continued through the Middle Ages until modern times and is evident in 14th-century glass from Venice.

Because it was used in glassmaking, manganese dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. Kaim also may have reduced manganese dioxide to isolate the metal, but that is uncertain. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, and later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.

Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (mineral form of manganese dioxide) contained a new element. Johan Gottlieb Gahn isolated an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.

The manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard. Around the beginning of the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic James Couper noted an association between miners&#x27; heavy exposure to manganese and a form of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.

The invention of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand for manganese dioxide. Until the development of batteries with nickel–cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc–carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because naturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc–carbon) and alkaline types.

Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties. This application was first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811–1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen.

==Occurrence==

Manganese comprises about 1000 ppm (0.1%) of the Earth&#x27;s crust and is the 12th most abundant element. Soil contains 7–9000 ppm of manganese with an average of 440 ppm. The atmosphere contains 0.01 μg/m3. Manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite (MnO2), braunite (Mn2+Mn3+6)SiO12), psilomelane , and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite (MnCO3).


The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO2). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores, such as sphalerite. Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, Gabon and Brazil. According to 1978 estimate, the ocean floor has 500 billion tons of manganese nodules. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s.

In South Africa, most identified deposits are located near Hotazel in the Northern Cape Province, (Kalahari manganese fields), with a 2011 estimate of 15 billion tons. In 2011 South Africa produced 3.4 million tons, topping all other nations.

Manganese is mainly mined in South Africa, Australia, China, Gabon, Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, Ghana, Ukraine and Malaysia.

== Production ==

For the production of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30–80%. Pure manganese used for the production of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.
A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing (a low grade) manganese ore by heap leaching. This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850 °C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide (MnO2) to form iron hydroxide (FeO(OH)) and elemental manganese (Mn).

This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.

===Oceanic environment===

In 1972, the CIA&#x27;s Project Azorian, through billionaire Howard Hughes, commissioned the ship &quot;Hughes Glomar Explorer&quot; with the cover story of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor. That triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules, which was not actually practical until the 2020s. The real mission of &quot;Hughes Glomar Explorer&quot; was to raise a sunken Soviet submarine, the K-129, with the goal of retrieving Soviet code books.

An abundant resource of manganese in the form of manganese nodules found on the ocean floor. These nodules, which are composed of 29% manganese, are located along the ocean floor. The environmental impacts of nodule collection are of interest.

Dissolved manganese (dMn) is found throughout the world&#x27;s oceans, 90% of which originates from hydrothermal vents. Particulate Mn develops in buoyant plumes over an active vent source, while the dMn behaves conservatively. Mn concentrations vary between the water columns of the ocean. At the surface, dMn is elevated due to input from external sources such as rivers, dust, and shelf sediments. Coastal sediments normally have lower Mn concentrations, but can increase due to anthropogenic discharges from industries such as mining and steel manufacturing, which enter the ocean from river inputs. Surface dMn concentrations can also be elevated biologically through photosynthesis and physically from coastal upwelling and wind-driven surface currents. Internal cycling such as photo-reduction from UV radiation can also elevate levels by speeding up the dissolution of Mn-oxides and oxidative scavenging, preventing Mn from sinking to deeper waters. Elevated levels at mid-depths can occur near mid-ocean ridges and hydrothermal vents. The hydrothermal vents release dMn enriched fluid into the water. The dMn can then travel up to 4,000 km due to the microbial capsules present, preventing exchange with particles, lowing the sinking rates. Dissolved Mn concentrations are even higher when oxygen levels are low. Overall, dMn concentrations are normally higher in coastal regions and decrease when moving offshore.

=== Soils ===
Manganese occurs in soils in three oxidation states: the divalent cation, Mn2+ and as brownish-black oxides and hydroxides containing Mn (III,IV), such as MnOOH and MnO2. Soil pH and oxidation-reduction conditions affect which of these three forms of Mn is dominant in a given soil. At pH values less than 6 or under anaerobic conditions, Mn(II) dominates, while under more alkaline and aerobic conditions, Mn(III,IV) oxides and hydroxides predominate. These effects of soil acidity and aeration state on the form of Mn can be modified or controlled by microbial activity. Microbial respiration can cause both the oxidation of Mn2+ to the oxides, and it can cause reduction of the oxides to the divalent cation.

The Mn(III,IV) oxides exist as brownish-black stains and small nodules on sand, silt, and clay particles. These surface coatings on other soil particles have high surface area and carry negative charge. The charged sites can adsorb and retain various cations, especially heavy metals (e.g., Cr3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+). In addition, the oxides can adsorb organic acids and other compounds. The adsorption of the metals and organic compounds can then cause them to be oxidized while the Mn(III,IV) oxides are reduced to Mn2+ (e.g., Cr3+ to Cr(VI) and colorless hydroquinone to tea-colored quinone polymers).

==Applications==
===Steel===
Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties. Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in these applications in metallurgy. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel. Often ferromanganese (usually about 80% manganese) is the intermediate in modern processes.

Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863 MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel (mangalloy). It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.

===Aluminium alloys===

Manganese is used in production of alloys with aluminium. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased resistance to corrosion through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion. The corrosion-resistant aluminium alloys 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most beverage cans. Before 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.

====Batteries====
Manganese(IV) oxide was used in the original type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon–zinc type flashlight cells. The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery.

:MnO2 + H2O + e− → MnO(OH) + 

The same material also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), which use the same basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000 tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose.

====Resistors====
Copper alloys of manganese, such as Manganin, are commonly found in metal element shunt resistors used for measuring relatively large amounts of current. These alloys have very low temperature coefficient of resistance and are resistant to sulfur. This makes the alloys particularly useful in harsh automotive and industrial environments.

====Fertilizers and feed additive====
Manganese oxide and sulfate are components of fertilizers. In the year 2000, an estimated 20,000 tons of these compounds were used in fertilizers in the US alone. A comparable amount of Mn compounds was also used in animal feeds.

====Niche====
Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl is an additive in some unleaded gasoline to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking.

Manganese(IV) oxide (manganese dioxide, MnO2) is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols (where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints. In some preparations, it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber.

Tetravalent manganese is used as an activator in red-emitting phosphors. While many compounds are known which show luminescence, the majority are not used in commercial application due to low efficiency or deep red emission. However, several Mn4+ activated fluorides were reported as potential red-emitting phosphors for warm-white LEDs. But to this day, only K2SiF6:Mn4+ is commercially available for use in warm-white LEDs.

The metal is occasionally used in coins; until 2000, the only United States coin to use manganese was the &quot;wartime&quot; nickel from 1942 to 1945. An alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins. However, because of shortage of nickel metal during the war, it was substituted by more available silver and manganese, thus resulting in an alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. Since 2000, dollar coins, for example the Sacagawea dollar and the Presidential $1 coins, are made from a brass containing 7% of manganese with a pure copper core. In both cases of nickel and dollar, the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin in the mechanisms of vending machines. In the case of the later U.S. dollar coins, the manganese alloy was intended to duplicate the properties of the copper/nickel alloy used in the previous Susan B. Anthony dollar.

Manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to reduce strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass. In 2009, Mas Subramanian and associates at Oregon State University discovered that manganese can be combined with yttrium and indium to form an intensely blue, non-toxic, inert, fade-resistant pigment, YInMn Blue, the first new blue pigment discovered in 200 years.

==Biochemistry==
Many classes of enzymes contain manganese cofactors including oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases and ligases. Other enzymes containing manganese are arginase and a Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). Some reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (although not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain manganese. Manganese-containing polypeptides are the diphtheria toxin, lectins, and integrins.

The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), containing four atoms of manganese, is a part of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. The OEC is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis, i.e., it is the catalyst that makes the O2 produced by plants.

==Human health and nutrition ==
Manganese is an essential human dietary element and is present as a coenzyme in several biological processes, which include macronutrient metabolism, bone formation, and free radical defense systems. Manganese is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes. The human body contains about 12 mg of manganese, mostly in the bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.


===Regulation===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for minerals in 2001. For manganese, there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese, the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Manganese deficiency is rare.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For people ages 15 and older, the AI is set at 3.0 mg/day. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 3.0 mg/day. For children ages 1–14 years, the AIs increase with age from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient information to set a UL.

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For manganese labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 2.0 mg, but as of 27 May 2016 it was revised to 2.3 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

Excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Deficiency ===

Manganese deficiency in humans, which is rare, results in a number of medical problems. A deficiency of manganese causes skeletal deformation in animals and inhibits the production of collagen in wound healing.

==Exposure==
===In water===
Waterborne manganese has a greater bioavailability than dietary manganese. According to results from a 2010 study, higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school-age children. It is hypothesized that long-term exposure due to inhaling the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to 8.7 million Americans at risk. However, data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess.

Mn levels can increase in seawater when hypoxic periods occur. Since 1990 there have been reports of Mn accumulation in marine organisms including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and echinoderms. Specific tissues are targets in different species, including the gills, brain, blood, kidney, and liver/hepatopancreas. Physiological effects have been reported in these species. Mn can affect the renewal of immunocytes and their functionality, such as phagocytosis and activation of pro-phenoloxidase, suppressing the organisms&#x27; immune systems. This causes the organisms to be more susceptible to infections. As climate change occurs, pathogen distributions increase, and in order for organisms to survive and defend themselves against these pathogens, they need a healthy, strong immune system. If their systems are compromised from high Mn levels, they will not be able to fight off these pathogens and die.

===Gasoline===

Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is an additive developed to replace lead compounds for gasolines to improve the octane rating. MMT is used only in a few countries. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves.

===Air===
Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage.

===Regulation===
Manganese exposure in United States is regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). People can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it. OSHA has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for manganese exposure in the workplace as 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 3 mg/m3. At levels of 500 mg/m3, manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health.

==Health and safety==
Manganese is essential for human health, albeit in milligram amounts.

The current maximum safe concentration under U.S. EPA rules is 50 μg Mn/L.

===Manganism===
Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.

Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In its early stages, an intoxicated person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms give way to late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson&#x27;s disease, manganism is not associated with loss of the sense of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.

Chronic manganese exposure has been shown to produce a parkinsonism-like illness characterized by movement abnormalities. This condition is not responsive to typical therapies used in the treatment of PD, suggesting an alternative pathway to the typical dopaminergic loss within the substantia nigra. Manganese may accumulate in the basal ganglia, leading to the abnormal movements. A mutation of the SLC30A10 gene, a manganese efflux transporter necessary for decreasing intracellular Mn, has been linked with the development of this Parkinsonism-like disease. The Lewy bodies typical to PD are not seen in Mn-induced parkinsonism.

Animal experiments have given the opportunity to examine the consequences of manganese overexposure under controlled conditions. In (non-aggressive) rats, manganese induces mouse-killing behavior.

===Toxicity===

Manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals, such as nickel and copper. However, exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of 5 mg/m3 even for short periods because of its toxicity level. Manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders.

===Neurodegenerative diseases===
A protein called DMT1 is the major transporter in manganese absorption from the intestine and may be the major transporter of manganese across the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.

<text>Molybdenum is a chemical element; it has symbol Mo (from Neo-Latin &quot;molybdaenum&quot;) and atomic number 42. The name derived from Ancient Greek &quot;&quot;, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores. Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.

Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; in its minerals, it is found only in oxidized states. The free element, a silvery metal with a grey cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of the world production of the element (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys.

Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water. Heating molybdenum-bearing minerals under oxygen and water affords molybdate ion , which forms quite soluble salts. Industrially, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world production of the element) are used as pigments and catalysts.

 are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen in the process of biological nitrogen fixation. At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria, plants, and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation. Most nitrogenases contain an iron–molybdenum cofactor FeMoco, which is believed to contain either Mo(III) or Mo(IV). By contrast Mo(VI) and Mo(IV) are complexed with molybdopterin in all other molybdenum-bearing enzymes. Molybdenum is an essential element for all higher eukaryote organisms, including humans. A species of sponge, &quot;Theonella conica&quot;, is known for hyperaccumulation of molybdenum.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
In its pure form, molybdenum is a silvery-grey metal with a Mohs hardness of 5.5 and a standard atomic weight of 95.95 g/mol. It has a melting point of , sixth highest of the naturally occurring elements; only tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten, and carbon have higher melting points. It has one of the lowest coefficients of thermal expansion among commercially used metals.

===Chemical properties===
Molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of 2.16 on the Pauling scale. It does not visibly react with oxygen or water at room temperature, but is attacked by halogens and hydrogen peroxide. Weak oxidation of molybdenum starts at ; bulk oxidation occurs at temperatures above 600 °C, resulting in molybdenum trioxide. Like many heavier transition metals, molybdenum shows little inclination to form a cation in aqueous solution, although the Mo3+ cation is known to form under carefully controlled conditions.

Gaseous molybdenum consists of the diatomic species Mo2. That molecule is a singlet, with two unpaired electrons in bonding orbitals, in addition to 5 conventional bonds. The result is a sextuple bond.

===Isotopes===

There are 39 known isotopes of molybdenum, ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 119, as well as 13 metastable nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these naturally occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable.

Molybdenum-98 is the most abundant isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019 y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and ruthenium. Of the synthetic radioisotopes, the most stable is 93Mo, with a half-life of 4,839 years.

The most common isotopic molybdenum application involves molybdenum-99, which is a fission product. It is a parent radioisotope to the short-lived gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine.
In 2008, the Delft University of Technology applied for a patent on the molybdenum-98-based production of molybdenum-99.

==Compounds==

Molybdenum forms chemical compounds in oxidation states −4 and from −2 to +6. Higher oxidation states are more relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its biological roles, mid-level oxidation states are often associated with metal clusters, and very low oxidation states are typically associated with organomolybdenum compounds. The chemistry of molybdenum and tungsten show strong similarities. The relative rarity of molybdenum(III), for example, contrasts with the pervasiveness of the chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), whereas the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2.


From the perspective of commerce, the most important compounds are molybdenum disulfide () and molybdenum trioxide (). The black disulfide is the main mineral. It is roasted in air to give the trioxide:

:2 + 7 → 2 + 4 

The trioxide, which is volatile at high temperatures, is the precursor to virtually all other Mo compounds as well as alloys. Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left).

Molybdenum(VI) oxide is soluble in strong alkaline water, forming molybdates (MoO42−). Molybdates are weaker oxidants than chromates. They tend to form structurally complex oxyanions by condensation at lower pH values, such as [Mo7O24]6− and [Mo8O26]4−. Polymolybdates can incorporate other ions, forming polyoxometalates. The dark-blue phosphorus-containing heteropolymolybdate P[Mo12O40]3− is used for the spectroscopic detection of phosphorus. 

The broad range of oxidation states of molybdenum is reflected in various molybdenum chlorides:
* Molybdenum(II) chloride MoCl2, which exists as the hexamer Mo6Cl12 and the related dianion [Mo6Cl14]2-.
* Molybdenum(III) chloride MoCl3, a dark red solid, which converts to the anion trianionic complex [MoCl6]3-.
* Molybdenum(IV) chloride MoCl4, a black solid, which adopts a polymeric structure.
* Molybdenum(V) chloride MoCl5 dark green solid, which adopts a dimeric structure.
* Molybdenum(VI) chloride MoCl6 is a black solid, which is monomeric and slowly decomposes to MoCl5 and Cl2 at room temperature.

The accessibility of these oxidation states depends quite strongly on the halide counterion: although molybdenum(VI) fluoride is stable, molybdenum does not form a stable hexachloride, pentabromide, or tetraiodide. 

Like chromium and some other transition metals, molybdenum forms quadruple bonds, such as in Mo2(CH3COO)4 and [Mo2Cl8]4−. The Lewis acid properties of the butyrate and perfluorobutyrate dimers, Mo2(O2CR)4 and Rh2(O2CR) 4, have been reported.

The oxidation state 0 and lower are possible with carbon monoxide as ligand, such as in molybdenum hexacarbonyl, Mo(CO)6.

==History==
Molybdenite—the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted—was previously known as molybdena. Molybdena was confused with and often utilized as though it were graphite. Like graphite, molybdenite can be used to blacken a surface or as a solid lubricant. Even when molybdena was distinguishable from graphite, it was still confused with the common lead ore PbS (now called galena); the name comes from Ancient Greek &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;lead&quot;. (The Greek word itself has been proposed as a loanword from Anatolian Luvian and Lydian languages).

Although (reportedly) molybdenum was deliberately alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ), that art was never employed widely and was later lost. In the West in 1754, Bengt Andersson Qvist examined a sample of molybdenite and determined that it did not contain lead and thus was not galena.

By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) neither galena nor graphite. Instead, Scheele correctly proposed that molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element, named &quot;molybdenum&quot; for the mineral in which it resided, and from which it might be isolated. Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.

For the next century, molybdenum had no industrial use. It was relatively scarce, the pure metal was difficult to extract, and the necessary techniques of metallurgy were immature. Early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise of increased hardness, but efforts to manufacture the alloys on a large scale were hampered with inconsistent results, a tendency toward brittleness, and recrystallization. In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to applications as a heating element for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas. In 1913, Frank E. Elmore developed a froth flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the primary isolation process.

During World War I, demand for molybdenum spiked; it was used both in armor plating and as a substitute for tungsten in high-speed steels. Some British tanks were protected by 75 mm (3 in) manganese steel plating, but this proved to be ineffective. The manganese steel plates were replaced with much lighter molybdenum steel plates allowing for higher speed, greater maneuverability, and better protection. The Germans also used molybdenum-doped steel for heavy artillery, like in the super-heavy howitzer Big Bertha, because traditional steel melts at the temperatures produced by the propellant of the one ton shell. After the war, demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications. In World War II, molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys.

==Occurrence and production==

Molybdenum is the 54th most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s crust with an average of 1.5 parts per million and the 25th most abundant element in the oceans, with an average of 10 parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe. The Soviet Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6 μm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth&#x27;s crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur in the same way as copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.

The world&#x27;s production of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000 t), the United States (64,000 t), Chile (38,000 t), Peru (18,000 t) and Mexico (12,000 t). The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3 Mt), the US (2.7 Mt) and Chile (1.2 Mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly shared between North America, South America (mainly in Chile), and China. Europe and the rest of Asia (mostly Armenia, Russia, Iran and Mongolia) produce the remainder.

In molybdenite processing, the ore is first roasted in air at a temperature of . The process gives gaseous sulfur dioxide and the molybdenum(VI) oxide:

:&lt;chem&gt;2MoS2 + 7O2 -&gt; 2MoO3 + 4SO2&lt;/chem&gt;

The resulting oxide is then usually extracted with aqueous ammonia to give ammonium molybdate:
:&lt;chem&gt;MoO3 + 2NH3 + H2O -&gt; (NH4)2(MoO4)&lt;/chem&gt;
Copper, an impurity in molybdenite, is separated at this stage by treatment with hydrogen sulfide. Ammonium molybdate converts to ammonium dimolybdate, which is isolated as a solid. Heating this solid gives molybdenum trioxide:
: &lt;chem&gt;(NH4)2Mo2O7 -&gt; 2MoO3 + 2NH3 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
Crude trioxide can be further purified by sublimation at .

Metallic molybdenum is produced by reduction of the oxide with hydrogen:
:&lt;chem&gt;MoO3 + 3H2 -&gt; Mo + 3H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The molybdenum for steel production is reduced by the aluminothermic reaction with addition of iron to produce ferromolybdenum. A common form of ferromolybdenum contains 60% molybdenum.

Molybdenum had a value of approximately $30,000 per tonne as of August 2009. It maintained a price at or near $10,000 per tonne from 1997 through 2003, and reached a peak of $103,000 per tonne in June 2005. In 2008, the London Metal Exchange announced that molybdenum would be traded as a commodity.

===Mining===
The Knaben mine in southern Norway, opened in 1885, was the first dedicated molybdenum mine. Closed in 1973 but reopened in 2007, it now produces of molybdenum disulfide per year. Large mines in Colorado (such as the Henderson mine and the Climax mine) and in British Columbia yield molybdenite as their primary product, while many porphyry copper deposits such as the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah and the Chuquicamata mine in northern Chile produce molybdenum as a byproduct of copper-mining.

==Applications==

===Alloys===

About 86% of molybdenum produced is used in metallurgy, with the rest used in chemical applications. The estimated global use is structural steel 35%, stainless steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool &amp; high-speed steels 9%, cast iron 6%, molybdenum elemental metal 6%, and superalloys 5%.

Molybdenum can withstand extreme temperatures without significantly expanding or softening, making it useful in environments of intense heat, including military armor, aircraft parts, electrical contacts, industrial motors, and supports for filaments in light bulbs.

Most high-strength steel alloys (for example, 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum. Even in these small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used each year in stainless steels, tool steels, cast irons, and high-temperature superalloys.

Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially so in the so-called superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO and 1925hMo). Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. Molybdenum is also used to enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless steels.

Because of its lower density and more stable price, molybdenum is sometimes used in place of tungsten. An example is the &#x27;M&#x27; series of high-speed steels such as M2, M4 and M42 as substitution for the &#x27;T&#x27; steel series, which contain tungsten. Molybdenum can also be used as a flame-resistant coating for other metals. Although its melting point is , molybdenum rapidly oxidizes at temperatures above making it better-suited for use in vacuum environments.

TZM (Mo (~99%), Ti (~0.5%), Zr (~0.08%) and some C) is a corrosion-resisting molybdenum superalloy that resists molten fluoride salts at temperatures above . It has about twice the strength of pure Mo, and is more ductile and more weldable, yet in tests it resisted corrosion of a standard eutectic salt (FLiBe) and salt vapors used in molten salt reactors for 1100 hours with so little corrosion that it was difficult to measure. Due to its excellent mechanical properties under high temperature and high pressure, TZM alloys are extensively applied in the military industry. It is used as the valve body of torpedo engines, rocket nozzles and gas pipelines, where it can withstand extreme thermal and mechanical stresses. It is also used as radiation shields in nuclear applications.

Other molybdenum-based alloys that do not contain iron have only limited applications. For example, because of its resistance to molten zinc, both pure molybdenum and molybdenum-tungsten alloys (70%/30%) are used for piping, stirrers and pump impellers that come into contact with molten zinc.

===Pure element applications===
* Molybdenum powder is used as a fertilizer for some plants, such as cauliflower.
* Elemental molybdenum is used in NO, NO2, NOx analyzers in power plants for pollution controls. At , the element acts as a catalyst for NO2/NOx to form NO molecules for detection by infrared light.
* Molybdenum anodes replace tungsten in certain low voltage X-ray sources for specialized uses such as mammography.
* The radioactive isotope molybdenum-99 is used to generate technetium-99m, used for medical imaging The isotope is handled and stored as the molybdate.

===Compound applications===
* Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is used as a solid lubricant and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) anti-wear agent. It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — in the event of a catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts.
* When combined with small amounts of cobalt, MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of petroleum. In the presence of hydrogen, this catalyst facilitates the removal of nitrogen and especially sulfur from the feedstock, which otherwise would poison downstream catalysts. HDS is one of the largest scale applications of catalysis in industry.
* Molybdenum oxides are important catalysts for selective oxidation of organic compounds. The production of the commodity chemicals acrylonitrile and formaldehyde relies on MoO&quot;x&quot;-based catalysts.
* Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) is an electrically conducting ceramic with primary use in heating elements operating at temperatures above 1500 °C in air.
* Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is used as an adhesive between enamels and metals.
* Lead molybdate (wulfenite) co-precipitated with lead chromate and lead sulfate is a bright-orange pigment used with ceramics and plastics.
* The molybdenum-based mixed oxides are versatile catalysts in the chemical industry. Some examples are the catalysts for the oxidation of carbon monoxide, propylene to acrolein and acrylic acid, the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile.
* Molybdenum carbides, nitride and phosphides can be used for hydrotreatment of rapeseed oil.
* Ammonium heptamolybdate is used in biological staining.
* Molybdenum coated soda lime glass is used in CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) solar cells, called CIGS solar cells.
* Phosphomolybdic acid is a stain used in thin-layer chromatography and trichrome staining in histochemistry.

==Biological role==

Molybdenum, despite its low concentration in the environment, is a critically important element for Earth&#x27;s biosphere due to its presence in the most common nitrogenases. Without molybdenum, nitrogen fixation would be greatly reduced, and a large part of biosynthesis as we know it would not occur. Molybdenum is also essential to many individual organisms as a component of enzymes, particularly as part of the molybdopterin class of cofactors.

===Mo-containing enzymes===
Molybdenum is an essential element in most organisms; a 2008 research paper speculated that a scarcity of molybdenum in the Earth&#x27;s early oceans may have strongly influenced the evolution of eukaryotic life (which includes all plants and animals).

At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes have been identified, mostly in bacteria. Those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. With one exception, Mo in proteins is bound by molybdopterin to give the molybdenum cofactor. The only known exception is nitrogenase, which uses the FeMoco cofactor, which has the formula Fe7MoS9C.

In terms of function, molybdoenzymes catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules in the process of regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional to the amount of molybdenum in the body. An extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can inhibit purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.

Mo is a component in most nitrogenases. Among molybdoenzymes, nitrogenases are unique in lacking the molybdopterin. Nitrogenases catalyze the production of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen:
:formula_1
The biosynthesis of the FeMoco active site is highly complex.

Molybdate is transported in the body as MoO42−.

===Human metabolism and deficiency===
Molybdenum is an essential trace dietary element. Four mammalian Mo-dependent enzymes are known, all of them harboring a pterin-based molybdenum cofactor (Moco) in their active site: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidoreductase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reductase. People severely deficient in molybdenum have poorly functioning sulfite oxidase and are prone to toxic reactions to sulfites in foods. The human body contains about 0.07 mg of molybdenum per kilogram of body weight, with higher concentrations in the liver and kidneys and lower in the vertebrae. Molybdenum is also present within human tooth enamel and may help prevent its decay.

Acute toxicity has not been seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180 mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10 mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.

Low soil concentration of molybdenum in a geographical band from northern China to Iran results in a general dietary molybdenum deficiency and is associated with increased rates of esophageal cancer. Compared to the United States, which has a greater supply of molybdenum in the soil, people living in those areas have about 16 times greater risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Molybdenum deficiency has also been reported as a consequence of non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, in much the same way as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. Since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults, the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.

A congenital molybdenum cofactor deficiency disease, seen in infants, is an inability to synthesize molybdenum cofactor, the heterocyclic molecule discussed above that binds molybdenum at the active site in all known human enzymes that use molybdenum. The resulting deficiency results in high levels of sulfite and urate, and neurological damage.

=== Excretion ===
Most molybdenum is excreted from the human body as molybdate in the urine. Furthermore, urinary excretion of molybdenum increases as dietary molybdenum intake increases. Small amounts of molybdenum are excreted from the body in the feces by way of the bile; small amounts also can be lost in sweat and in hair.

===Excess and copper antagonism===
High levels of molybdenum can interfere with the body&#x27;s uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency can be aggravated by excess sulfur.

Copper reduction or deficiency can also be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically in the treatment of copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson&#x27;s disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.

In some grazing livestock, most strongly in cattle, molybdenum excess in the soil of pasturage can produce scours (diarrhea) if the pH of the soil is neutral to alkaline; see .

===Mammography===
Molybdenum targets are used in mammography because they produce X-rays in the energy range of 17-20 keV, which is optimal for imaging soft tissues like the breast. The characteristic X-rays emitted from molybdenum provide high contrast between different types of tissues, allowing for the effective visualization of microcalcifications and other subtle abnormalities in breast tissue. This energy range also minimizes radiation dose while maximizing image quality, making molybdenum targets particularly suitable for breast cancer screening.

==Dietary recommendations==
In 2000, the then U.S. Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine, NAM) updated its Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for molybdenum. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead.

An AI of 2 micrograms (μg) of molybdenum per day was established for infants up to 6 months of age, and 3 μg/day from 7 to 12 months of age, both for males and females. For older children and adults, the following daily RDAs have been established for molybdenum: 17 μg from 1 to 3 years of age, 22 μg from 4 to 8 years, 34 μg from 9 to 13 years, 43 μg from 14 to 18 years, and 45 μg for persons 19 years old and older. All these RDAs are valid for both sexes. Pregnant or lactating females from 14 to 50 years of age have a higher daily RDA of 50 μg of molybdenum.

As for safety, the NAM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of molybdenum, the UL is 2000 μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For women and men ages 15 and older, the AI is set at 65 μg/day. Pregnant and lactating women have the same AI. For children aged 1–14 years, the AIs increase with age from 15 to 45 μg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs, but on the other hand, the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 600 μg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.

===Labeling===
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For molybdenum labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 75 μg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 45 μg. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

==Food sources==
Average daily intake varies between 120 and 240 μg/day, which is higher than dietary recommendations. Pork, lamb, and beef liver each have approximately 1.5 parts per million of molybdenum. Other significant dietary sources include green beans, eggs, sunflower seeds, wheat flour, lentils, cucumbers, and cereal grain.

==Precautions==
Molybdenum dusts and fumes, generated by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust trapped in the sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5 mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600 mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000 mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.
