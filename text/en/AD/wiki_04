<text>Interlingua (, ) is an international auxiliary language (IAL) developed between 1937 and 1951 by the American International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA). It is a constructed language of the &quot;naturalistic&quot; variety, whose vocabulary, grammar, and other characteristics are derived from natural languages. Interlingua literature maintains that (written) Interlingua is comprehensible to the billions of people who speak Romance languages, though it is actively spoken by only a few hundred.

Interlingua was developed to combine a simple, mostly regular grammar with a vocabulary common to a wide range of western European languages, making it easy to learn for those whose native languages were sources of Interlingua&#x27;s vocabulary and grammar.

The name Interlingua comes from the Latin words &#x27;, meaning &#x27;between&#x27;, and&#x27;, meaning &#x27;tongue&#x27; or &#x27;language&#x27;. These morphemes are the same in Interlingua; thus, &quot;Interlingua&quot; would mean &#x27;between language&#x27;.

== Overview ==
Interlingua focuses on common vocabulary shared by Western European languages, which are often descended from or heavily influenced by the Latin language (such as the Romance languages) and Greek language. Interlingua organizers have four &quot;primary control languages&quot; where, by default, a word (or variant thereof) is expected to appear in at least three of them to qualify for inclusion in Interlingua. These are English; French; Italian; and a combination of Spanish and Portuguese which are treated as a single mega-language for Interlingua purposes, as both are west Iberian languages. Additionally, German and Russian have been dubbed &quot;secondary control languages&quot;. While the result is often akin to Neo-Latin as the most frequent source of commonality, Interlingua words can have origins in any language, as long as they have drifted into the primary control languages as loanwords. For example, the Japanese words &quot;geisha&quot; and &quot;samurai&quot; and the Finnish word &quot;sauna&quot; are used in most Western European languages, and therefore in Interlingua as well; similarly, the Guugu Yimithirr word &quot;gangurru&quot; is used in latinized form (Interlingua: , English: &quot;kangaroo&quot;).

The maintainers of Interlingua attempt to keep the grammar simple and word formation regular, and use only a small number of roots and affixes. This is intended to make the language quicker to learn.

== History ==
The American heiress Alice Vanderbilt Morris (1874–1950) became interested in linguistics and the international auxiliary language movement in the early 1920s. In 1924, Morris and her husband, Dave Hennen Morris, established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in New York City. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a more complex and scientific basis. Morris developed the research program of IALA in consultation with Edward Sapir, William Edward Collinson, and Otto Jespersen.

Investigations of the auxiliary language problem were in progress at the International Research Council, the American Council on Education, the American Council of Learned Societies, the British, French, Italian, and American Associations for the advancement of science, and other groups of specialists. Morris created IALA as a continuation of this work.

=== International Auxiliary Language Association ===
The IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics. Numerous studies by Sapir, Collinson, and Morris Swadesh in the 1930s and 1940s, for example, were funded by IALA. Alice Morris edited several of these studies and provided much of IALA&#x27;s financial support. For example, Morris herself edited Sapir and Morris Swadesh&#x27;s 1932 cross-linguistic study of ending-point phenomena, and Collinson&#x27;s 1937 study of indication. IALA also received support from groups such as the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation, the Research Corporation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.

In its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about languages and interlinguistics; and comparing extant IALs, including Esperanto, Esperanto II, Ido, Peano&#x27;s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Novial, and Interlingue (Occidental). In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages.

At the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in Geneva in 1931, IALA began to break new ground; 27 recognized linguists signed a testimonial of support for IALA&#x27;s research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in Rome in 1933. That same year, Herbert N. Shenton and Edward Thorndike became influential in IALA&#x27;s work by authoring studies in the interlinguistic field.

The first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken in 1937, when a committee of 24 linguists from 19 universities published &quot;Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary&quot;. However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.

===Development of a new language===
Originally, the association had not intended to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it more effectively. However, after ten years of research, many members of IALA concluded that none of the existing interlanguages were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world&#x27;s interlanguage community.

To that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., Peano&#x27;s Interlingua, Novial and Occidental) or systematic (e.g., Esperanto and Ido) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Thorndike&#x27;s paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many, or even a majority, of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a Procrustean bed, forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.

IALA&#x27;s research activities were based in Liverpool, before relocating to New York due to the outbreak of World War II, where E. Clark Stillman established a new research staff. Stillman, with the assistance of Alexander Gode, constructed the methodology for selecting Interlingua vocabulary based on a comparison of control languages.

In 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. IALA began to develop models of the proposed language, the first of which were presented in Morris&#x27;s &quot;General Report&quot; in 1945.

===The four models===
From 1946 to 1948, French linguist André Martinet was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.

Model P was unchanged from 1945; Model M was relatively modern in comparison to more classical P. Model K was slightly modified in the direction of Ido. The resulting four models that were canvassed were:
An example sentence:
The vote total ended up as follows: P 26.6%, M 37.5%, C 20%, and K 15%. The two more schematic models, C and K, were rejected. Of the two naturalistic models, M attracted somewhat more support than P. Taking national biases into account (for example, the French who were polled disproportionately favored Model M), IALA decided on a compromise between models M and P, with certain elements of C.

===Finalization===
The German-American Gode and the French Martinet did not get along. Martinet resigned and took up a position at Columbia University in 1948, and Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua&#x27;s development. His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; take the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repair them with elements of Model C as needed; and develop a vocabulary. Alice Vanderbilt Morris died in 1950, and the funding that had sustained IALA ceased, but sufficient funds remained to publish a dictionary and grammar. The vocabulary and grammar of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized &quot;&quot; and the Interlingua–English Dictionary (IED). In 1954, IALA published an introductory manual entitled &quot;Interlingua a Prime Vista&quot; (&quot;Interlingua at First Sight&quot;).

Interlingua as presented by the IALA is very close to Peano&#x27;s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), both in its grammar and especially in its vocabulary. A distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.

===Interlingua&#x27;s first decades===
An early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter &quot;Spectroscopia Molecular&quot;, published from 1952 to 1980. In 1954, the Second World Cardiological Congress in Washington, D.C. released summaries of its talks in both English and Interlingua. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. Gode wrote a monthly column in Interlingua in the &quot;Science Newsletter&quot; published by the Science Service from the early 1950s until his death in 1970.

IALA closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later. Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service, which hired Gode as head of its newly formed Interlingua Division. Hugh E. Blair, Gode&#x27;s close friend and colleague, became his assistant. A successor organization, the Interlingua Institute, was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua summaries for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.

Beginning in the 1980s, UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Several Scandinavian schools undertook projects that used Interlingua as a means of teaching the international scientific and intellectual vocabulary.

In 2000, the Interlingua Institute was dissolved amid funding disputes with the UMI; the American Interlingua Society, established the following year, succeeded the institute.

===Interlingua today===
The original goal of an interlanguage meant for global events has faced competition from English as a lingua franca and International English in the 21st century. The scientific community frequently uses English in international conferences and publications, for example, rather than Interlingua. However, the rise of the Internet has made it easier for the general public with an interest in constructed languages to learn Interlingua. Interlingua is promoted internationally by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua. Periodicals and books are produced by national organizations, such as the Societate American pro Interlingua, the Svenska Sällskapet för Interlingua, and the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua.

&quot;Panorama in Interlingua&quot; is the most prominent of several Interlingua periodicals. It is a 28-page magazine published bimonthly that covers current events, science, editorials, and Interlingua.

== Community ==
It is not certain how many people have an active knowledge of Interlingua. Most constructed languages other than Esperanto have very few speakers. The Hungarian census of 2001, which collected information about languages spoken, found just two people in the entire country who claimed to speak Interlingua.

Advocates say that Interlingua&#x27;s greatest advantage is that it is the most widely &quot;understood&quot; international auxiliary language besides Interlingua (IL) de A.p.I. by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.

Interlingua web pages include editions of Wikipedia and Wiktionary, and a number of periodicals, including &quot;Panorama in Interlingua&quot; from the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI).

Every two years, the UMI organizes an international conference in a different country. In the year between, the Scandinavian Interlingua societies co-organize a conference in Sweden, as a number of Interlingua speakers are in Scandinavia. National organizations such as the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua also organize regular conferences.

Interlingua is taught in some high schools and universities, sometimes as a means of teaching other languages quickly, presenting interlinguistics, or introducing an international vocabulary. A two-week course was taught at the University of Granada in Spain in 2007, for example.

, Google Keyboard supports Interlingua.

== Orthography ==
Interlingua has a largely phonemic orthography.

=== Interlingua alphabet ===
Interlingua uses the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet with no diacritics. The alphabet, pronunciation in IPA and letter names in Interlingua are:

===Collateral orthography===

The book &quot;Grammar of Interlingua&quot; defines in §15 a &quot;collateral orthography&quot; that defines how a word is spelt in Interlingua once assimilated regardless of etymology.

== Phonology ==

Interlingua is primarily a written language, and the pronunciation is not entirely settled. The sounds in parentheses are not used by all speakers.

===Pronunciation===
For the most part, consonants are pronounced as in English, while the vowels are like Spanish. Written double consonants may be geminated as in Italian for extra clarity or pronounced as single as in English or French. Interlingua has five falling diphthongs, , and , although and are rare.

=== Stress ===
The &quot;general rule&quot; is that stress falls on the vowel before the last consonant (e.g., , &#x27;language&#x27;, , &#x27;to be&#x27;, , &#x27;requirement&#x27;) ignoring the final plural (e.g. , the plural of , still has the same stress as the singular), and where that is not possible, on the first vowel (, &#x27;way&#x27;, , &#x27;I create&#x27;). There are a few exceptions, and the following rules account for most of them:
* Adjectives and nouns ending in a vowel followed by , , or are stressed on the third-last syllable (, , &#x27;other&#x27;, but &#x27;she imposes&#x27;).
* Words ending in , and , are stressed on the third-last syllable (, , , , , &#x27;century&#x27;).
* Words ending in are stressed on the second-last syllable ().

Speakers may pronounce all words according to the general rule mentioned above. For example, is acceptable, although is more common.

=== Phonotactics ===
Interlingua has no explicitly defined phonotactics. However, the prototyping procedure for determining Interlingua words, which strives for internationality, should in general lead naturally to words that are easy for most learners to pronounce. In the process of forming new words, an ending cannot always be added without a modification of some kind in between. A good example is the plural &quot;-s&quot;, which is always preceded by a vowel to prevent the occurrence of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. If the singular does not end in a vowel, the final &quot;-s&quot; becomes &quot;-es.&quot;

=== Loanwords ===
Unassimilated foreign loanwords, or borrowed words, are spelled as in their language of origin. Their spelling may contain diacritics, or accent marks. If the diacritics do not affect pronunciation, they are removed.

== Vocabulary ==
Words in Interlingua may be taken from any language, as long as their internationality is verified by their presence in seven &quot;control&quot; languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, and English, with German and Russian acting as secondary controls. These are the most widely spoken Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages, respectively. Because of their close relationship, Spanish and Portuguese are treated as one unit. The largest number of Interlingua words are of Latin origin, with the Greek and Germanic languages providing the second and third largest number. The remainder of the vocabulary originates in Slavic and non-Indo-European languages.

=== Eligibility ===

A word, that is a form with meaning, is eligible for the Interlingua vocabulary if it is verified by at least three of the four primary control languages. Either secondary control language can substitute for a primary language. Any word of Indo-European origin found in a control language can contribute to the eligibility of an international word. In some cases, the archaic or &quot;potential&quot; presence of a word can contribute to its eligibility.

A word can be potentially present in a language when a derivative is present, but the word itself is not. English &quot;proximity&quot;, for example, gives support to Interlingua , meaning &#x27;near, close&#x27;. This counts as long as one or more control languages actually have this basic root word, which the Romance languages all do. Potentiality also occurs when a concept is represented as a compound or derivative in a control language, the morphemes that make it up are themselves international, and the combination adequately conveys the meaning of the larger word. An example is Italian (lit. &#x27;flamebearer&#x27;), meaning &#x27;match, lucifer&#x27;, which leads to Interlingua , or &#x27;match&#x27;. This word is thus said to be potentially present in the other languages although they may represent the meaning with a single morpheme.

Words do not enter the Interlingua vocabulary solely because cognates exist in a sufficient number of languages. If their meanings have become different over time, they are considered different words for the purpose of Interlingua eligibility. If they still have one or more meanings in common, however, the word can enter Interlingua with this smaller set of meanings.

If this procedure did not produce an international word, the word for a concept was originally taken from Latin (see below). This only occurred with a few grammatical particles.

=== Form ===
The form of an Interlingua word is considered an &quot;international prototype&quot; with respect to the other words. On the one hand, it should be neutral, free from characteristics peculiar to one language. On the other hand, it should maximally capture the characteristics common to all contributing languages. As a result, it can be transformed into any of the contributing variants using only these language-specific characteristics. If the word has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their morphological connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for &#x27;time&#x27; is spelled and not or in order to match it with its derived adjectives, such as .

The language-specific characteristics are closely related to the sound laws of the individual languages; the resulting words are often close or even identical to the most recent form common to the contributing words. This sometimes corresponds with that of Vulgar Latin. At other times, it is much more recent or even contemporary. It is never older than the classical period.

=== An illustration ===
The French , Italian , Spanish , and Portuguese appear quite different, but they descend from a historical form . German , Dutch and English &quot;eye&quot; (cf. Czech and Polish , Russian and Ukrainian ()) are related to this form in that all three descend from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;. In addition, international derivatives like &quot;ocular&quot; and occur in all of Interlingua&#x27;s control languages. Each of these forms contributes to the eligibility of the Interlingua word. German and English base words do not influence the form of the Interlingua word, because their Indo-European connection is considered too remote. Instead, the remaining base words and especially the derivatives determine the form found in Interlingua.

===Free word-building===
Words can also be included in Interlingua by deriving them using Interlingua words and affixes; a method called free word-building. Thus, in the Interlingua–English Dictionary (IED), Alexander Gode followed the principle that every word listed is accompanied by all of its clear compounds and derivatives, along with the word or words it is derived from. A reader skimming through the IED notices many entries followed by large groups of derived and compound words. A good example is the Interlingua word , which is followed by , , , , , , , and many other words.

Other words in the IED do not have derivatives listed. Gode saw these words as potential word families. Although all derived words in the IED are found in at least one control language, speakers may make free use of Interlingua roots and affixes. For example, (&#x27;jade&#x27;) can be used to form , (&#x27;to jadify, make into jade, make look like jade&#x27;), , and so on. These word forms would be impermissible in English but would be good Interlingua.

====Word-building by analogy====
Gode and Hugh E. Blair explained in the that the &quot;basic principle of practical word-building&quot; is analogical. If a pattern can be found in the existing international vocabulary, new words can be formed according to that pattern. A meaning of the suffix is &#x27;person who practices the art or science of...&#x27; This suffix allows the derivation of from , from , and so on. An Interlingua speaker can freely form from and from by following the same pattern.

====Usefulness and clarity====
As noted above, the only limits to free word-building in Interlingua are &quot;clarity&quot; and &quot;usefulness&quot;. These concepts are touched upon here:

Any number of words could be formed by stringing roots and affixes together, but some would be more useful than others. For example, the English word &quot;rainer&quot; means &#x27;a person who rains&#x27;, but most people would be surprised that it is included in English dictionaries. The corresponding Interlingua word is unlikely to appear in a dictionary because of its lack of utility. Interlingua, like any traditional language, &quot;could&quot; build up large numbers of these words, but this would be undesirable.

Gode stressed the principle of &quot;clarity&quot; in free word-building. As Gode noted, the noun (&#x27;mariner&#x27;) can be formed from the adjective , because its meaning is clear. The noun meaning &#x27;navy&#x27; cannot be formed, because its meaning would not be clear from the adjective and suffix that gave rise to it.

== Grammar ==
Interlingua has been developed to omit any grammatical feature that is absent from any one primary control language. Thus, Interlingua has no noun–adjective agreement by gender, case, or number (cf. Spanish and Portuguese or Italian , &#x27;black female cats&#x27;), because this is absent from English, and it has no progressive verb tenses (English &quot;I am reading&quot;), because they are absent from French. Conversely, Interlingua distinguishes singular nouns from plural nouns because all the control languages do. With respect to the secondary control languages, Interlingua has articles, unlike Russian.

The definite article is invariable, as in English (&quot;the&quot;). Nouns have no grammatical gender. Plurals are formed by adding &quot;-s&quot;, or &quot;-es&quot; after a final consonant. Personal pronouns take one form for the subject and one for the direct object and reflexive. In the third person, the reflexive is always &quot;se&quot;. Most adverbs are derived regularly from adjectives by adding , or after a &quot;-c&quot;. An adverb can be formed from any adjective in this way.

Verbs take the same form for all persons (, , , &#x27;I live&#x27;, &#x27;you live&#x27;, &#x27;she lives&#x27;). The indicative (, &#x27;appear&#x27;, &#x27;appears&#x27;) is the same as the imperative ( &#x27;appear!&#x27;), and there is no subjunctive. Three common verbs usually take short forms in the present tense: for &#x27;is&#x27;, &#x27;am&#x27;, &#x27;are;&#x27; for &#x27;has&#x27;, &#x27;have;&#x27; and for &#x27;go&#x27;, &#x27;goes&#x27;. A few irregular verb forms are available, but rarely used.

There are four simple tenses (present, past, future, and conditional), three compound tenses (past, future, and conditional), and the passive voice. The compound structures employ an auxiliary plus the infinitive or the past participle (e.g., , &#x27;He has arrived&#x27;). Simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses (e.g., , &#x27;We would have died&#x27;).

Word order is subject–verb–object, except that a direct object pronoun or reflexive pronoun comes before the verb (, &#x27;I see them&#x27;). Adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify, but they most often follow it. The position of adverbs is flexible, though constrained by common sense.

The grammar of Interlingua has been described as similar to that of the Romance languages, but simplified, primarily under the influence of English. A 1991 paper argued that Interlingua&#x27;s grammar was similar to the simple grammars of Japanese and particularly Chinese.

F. P. Gopsill has written that Interlingua has no irregularities, although Gode&#x27;s &quot;Interlingua Grammar&quot; suggests that Interlingua has a small number of irregularities.

== Reception ==

One criticism that applies to naturalistic constructed languages in general is that if an educated traveler is willing to learn a naturalistic conlang, they may find it even more useful to learn a natural language outright, such as International English. Planned conlangs at least hold out the promise of &quot;fixing&quot; or standardizing certain irregular aspects of natural languages and providing unique advantages, despite the lack of speakers, but naturalistic conlangs have to compete with the natural languages they are based on. In practice, conferences with international attendance tend to be held in a natural language popular among the attendees rather than an international auxiliary language.

== Samples ==
From an essay by Alexander Gode:

:Interlingua has detached itself from the movement for the development and introduction of a universal language for all humanity. Whether or not one believes that a language for all humanity is possible, whether or not one believes that Interlingua will become such a language is totally irrelevant from the point of view of Interlingua itself. The only fact that matters (from the point of view of Interlingua itself) is that Interlingua, thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that Interlingua wishes to be judged.

==Flags and symbols==
As with Esperanto, there have been proposals for a flag of Interlingua; the proposal by Czech translator Karel Podrazil is recognized by multilingual sites. It consists of a white four-pointed star extending to the edges of the flag and dividing it into an upper blue and lower red half. The star is symbolic of the four cardinal directions, and the two halves symbolize Romance and non-Romance speakers of Interlingua who understand each other.

Another symbol of Interlingua is the &quot;Blue Marble&quot; surrounded by twelve stars on a black or blue background, echoing the twelve stars of the Flag of Europe (because the source languages of Interlingua are purely European).

<text>The Isle of Wight ( ) is an island, English county and unitary authority in the English Channel, off the coast of Hampshire, across the Solent. It is the largest and second-most populous island in England. Referred to as &quot;The Island&quot; by residents, the Isle of Wight has resorts that have been popular holiday destinations since Victorian times. It is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland, and chines. The island is historically part of Hampshire. The island is designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. With a land area of , it is about half the size of Singapore.

The island has been home to the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Queen Victoria built her summer residence and final home, Osborne House, at East Cowes on the Isle. It has a maritime and industrial tradition of boat-building, sail-making, the manufacture of flying boats, hovercraft, and Britain&#x27;s space rockets. The island hosts annual music festivals, including the Isle of Wight Festival, which in 1970 was the largest rock music event ever held. It has well-conserved wildlife and some of Europe&#x27;s richest cliffs and quarries of dinosaur fossils.

The island has played an essential part in the defence of the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth and has been near the front line of conflicts through the ages, having faced the Spanish Armada and weathered the Battle of Britain. Being rural for most of its history, its Victorian fashionability and the growing affordability of holidays led to significant urban development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The island was historically a part of Hampshire, but became a separate administrative county in 1890. It had continued to share the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire until 1974, when it was made a ceremonial county in its own right. The island no longer has administrative links to Hampshire. However, the two counties continue to share their police force and fire and rescue service, and the island&#x27;s Anglican churches belong to the Diocese of Portsmouth (originally Winchester). A combined local authority with Portsmouth and Southampton was considered as part of a regional devolution package but was subsequently rejected by the UK government in 2018.

The quickest public transport link to the mainland is the hovercraft (Hovertravel) from Ryde to Southsea. Three vehicle ferries and two catamaran services cross the Solent to Southampton, Lymington, and Portsmouth via the island&#x27;s largest ferry operator, Wightlink, and the island&#x27;s second-largest ferry company, Red Funnel. Tourism is the largest industry on the island.

==Name==
The oldest records that give a name for the Isle of Wight are from the Roman Empire. It was called &quot;Vectis&quot; or &quot;Vecta&quot; in Latin and &quot;Iktis&quot; or &quot;Ouiktis&quot; in Greek. Latin &quot;Vecta,&quot; Old English &quot;Wiht,&quot; and Old Welsh &quot;Gueid&quot; and &quot;Guith&quot; were recorded from the Anglo-Saxon period. The Domesday Book called the island &quot;Wit.&quot; The modern Welsh name is &quot;Ynys Wyth&quot; (&quot;ynys&quot; meaning island). These are all variants of the same name, possibly sharing a Celtic origin with Welsh &quot;gwaith&quot; &#x27;work&#x27;, a cognate of both Latin &quot;vectis&quot; (&quot;lever,&quot; or literally &quot;the act of lifting&quot;) and Old English &quot;wiht&quot; (&quot;weight&quot;). It may mean &#x27;place of the division,&#x27; since the island divides the two arms of the Solent.

In Old English, inhabitants of the Isle were known as &quot;Wihtware&quot;.

==History==
===Stone Age ===
During Pleistocene glacial periods sea levels were lower than at present, and the area that today forms the Solent was part of the valley of the now extinct Solent River. The river flowed eastward from Dorset, following the course of the modern Solent strait. The river travelled east of the Isle of Wight before flowing southwest towards the major Channel River system. At these times, extensive gravel terraces associated with the Solent River and the forerunners of the island&#x27;s modern rivers were deposited. During warmer interglacial periods, silts, beach gravels, clays, and muds of marine and estuarine origin were deposited due to higher sea levels, suggesting similar marine or estuary conditions to those experienced today. 
The earliest clear evidence of Lower Palaeolithic archaic human occupation on what is now the Isle of Wight is found close to Priory Bay. More than 300 acheulean handaxes have been recovered from the beach and cliff slopes, originating from a sequence of Pleistocene gravels dating approximately to MIS 11-MIS 9 (424,000–374,000 years ago). Reworked and abraded artefacts found at the site may be considerably older however, closer to 500,000 years old. The identity of the hominids who produced these tools is unknown. However, sites and fossils of the same age range in Europe are often attributed to &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; or early populations of Neanderthals.

A Middle Palaeolithic Mousterian flint assemblage, consisting of 50 handaxes and debitage, has been recovered from Great Pan Farm in the Medina Valley near Newport. Gravel sequences at the site have been dated to the MIS 3 interstadial during the last glacial period ( ago). These tools are associated with the late Neanderthal occupation, and evidence of late Neanderthal presence is seen across Britain at this time.

No significant evidence of Upper Palaeolithic activity exists on the Isle of Wight. This period is associated with the expansion and establishment of populations of modern human (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) hunter-gatherers in Europe, beginning around 45,000 years ago. However, evidence of late Upper Palaeolithic activity has been found at nearby sites on the mainland, notably Hengistbury Head in Dorset, dating to just before the onset of the Holocene and the end of the last glacial period ago. 
Evidence of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer occupation on the island is generally found along the river valleys, particularly along the Solent coastline of the island and in the former catchment of the western Yar. Other key terrestrial sites are found at Newtown Creek, Werrar, and Wootton-Quarr.

A submerged escarpment below sea level off Bouldnor Cliff on the island&#x27;s Solent coastline has yielded an internationally significant mesolithic archaeological site. The Bouldnor Cliff site exhibits evidence of seasonal occupation by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers dating to . Finds include flint tools, burnt flint, worked timbers, wooden platforms, and pits. The worked wood shows evidence of splitting large planks from oak trunks, interpreted as being intended for use as dug-out canoes. DNA analysis of sediments at the site yielded wheat DNA, not found in Britain until 2,000 years after the occupation at Bouldnor Cliff. It has been suggested this is evidence of wide-reaching trade in Mesolithic Europe; however, the contemporaneity of the wheat with the Mesolithic occupation has been contested. Owing to lower sea levels during the mesolithic the hunter-gatherer site was located on a river bank surrounded by wetlands and woodland. As sea levels rose throughout the early Holocene the Solent flooded, submerging the site.

From ago migrations of farming populations to Britain from northwest Europe brought the onset of the Neolithic, largely replacing and assimilating previous mesolithic hunter-gatherer populations. On the Isle of Wight neolithic occupation is attested to by flint tool finds, pottery and monuments. The Isle of Wight&#x27;s neolithic communities were agriculturalists, farming livestock and crops. The Isle of Wight&#x27;s most recognisable neolithic site is the Longstone at Mottistone, the remains of an early Neolithic long barrow. Initially constructed with two standing stones at the entrance, only one remains upright today. The site would have likely served as a communal tomb and ritual site for nearby farming communities. A Neolithic mortuary enclosure has also been identified on Tennyson Down near Freshwater.

===Bronze Age and Iron Age===
From ago Britain experienced a new wave of migrations from continental Europe, linked to the Bell Beaker Culture. Bell beaker migrants are typically thought to have introduced metal-working to Britain marking the beginning of the Bronze Age. Evidence of early Bronze Age occupation on the Isle of Wight include distinctive bell beaker pots, flint tools, occupation sites and finds of bronze weapons and tools, occurring either individually or in hoard deposits such as the famous Arreton hoard. Highly visible evidence of early Bronze Age activity on the Isle of Wight comes in the form of the barrow monuments present across the island&#x27;s chalk downland. It is likely these barrows were high-status burial sites, and often occur in &#x27;cemeteries&#x27; a notable example being Five Barrows near Brook. 
Bronze Age Britain had large tin reserves in Cornwall and Devon areas, which was necessary to smelt bronze. At that time, the sea level was much lower, and carts of tin were brought across the Solent at low tide for export, possibly on the Ferriby Boats. Anthony Snodgrass suggests that a shortage of tin, as a part of the Bronze Age Collapse and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300 BC, forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze. 

From the 7th century BC, during the Late Iron Age, the Isle of Wight, like the rest of Great Britain, was occupied by the Celtic Britons, in the form of the Durotriges tribe, as attested by finds of their coins, for example, the South Wight Hoard, and the Shalfleet Hoard. The island was known as &quot;Ynys Weith&quot; in Brittonic Celtic. Southeastern Britain experienced significant immigration, which is reflected in the current residents&#x27; genetic makeup. As the Iron Age began, tin value likely dropped sharply, greatly changing the Isle of Wight&#x27;s economy. Trade, however, continued, as evidenced by the local abundance of European Iron Age coins.

===Roman period===
Julius Caesar reported that the Belgae took the Isle of Wight in about 85 BC and recognised the culture of this general region as &quot;Belgic&quot; but made no reference to Vectis. The Roman historian Suetonius mentions that the island was captured by the commander Vespasian. The Romans built no towns on the island, but the remains of at least seven Roman villas have been found, indicating the prosperity of local agriculture. First-century exports were principally hides, enslaved people, hunting dogs, grain, cattle, silver, gold, and iron.

===Early medieval period===

There are indications that the island had vast trading links, with a port at Bouldnor, evidence of Bronze Age tin trading, and finds of Late Iron Age coins. Starting in AD 449, the 5th and 6th centuries saw groups of Germanic-speaking peoples from Northern Europe crossing the English Channel and gradually set about conquering the region.

During the Early Middle Ages, the island was settled by Jutes as the heathen kingdom of the Wihtwara. In Asser’s &quot;Life of Alfred&quot;, he states that the West Saxon kings Cerdic and Cynric granted lordship of Wight to two brothers, Stuf and Wihtgar, said to be of Jutish and Gothic origin and cousins of Cynric. The brothers then set about exterminating the native Britons, either killing them or driving them into exile. According to Bede, in 685, Wight was invaded by King Cædwalla of Wessex, who attempted to violently replace the Jutish inhabitants with his own followers. In 686, the native King Arwald was killed in battle, and the island became the last part of English lands to be converted to Christianity.

It suffered especially from Viking raids and was often used as a winter base by Viking raiders when they could not reach Normandy. Later, both Earl Tostig and his brother Harold Godwinson (who became King Harold II) held manors on the island.

===Norman Conquest to 18th century===
The Norman Conquest of 1066 created the position of Lord of the Isle of Wight; the island was given by William the Conqueror to his kinsman William FitzOsbern. Carisbrooke Priory and the fort of Carisbrooke Castle were then founded. Allegiance was sworn to FitzOsbern rather than the king; the Lordship was subsequently granted to the de Redvers family by Henry I after his succession in 1100.
For nearly 200 years the island was a semi-independent feudal fiefdom, with the de Redvers family ruling from Carisbrooke. The final private owner was the Countess Isabella de Fortibus, who, on her deathbed in 1293, was persuaded to sell it to Edward I. Subsequently, the island was under the control of the English Crown and its Lordship a royal appointment.

The island continued to be attacked from the continent: it was raided in 1374 by the fleet of Castile and in 1377 by French raiders who burned several towns, including Newtown.

Under Henry VIII, who developed the Royal Navy and its Portsmouth base, the island was fortified at Yarmouth, Cowes, East Cowes, and Sandown.

The French invasion on 21 July 1545 (famous for the sinking of the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; on the 19th) was repulsed by local militia.

On 1 May 1647, Swedish and English ships clashed in a brief skirmish off the island, ending in the Swedish fleet being able to escape.

During the English Civil War, King Charles I fled to the Isle of Wight, believing he would receive sympathy from Governor Robert Hammond. Still, Hammond imprisoned the king in Carisbrooke Castle.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the island was a staging post for British troops departing on expeditions against the French coast, such as the Raid on Rochefort. During 1759, with a planned French invasion imminent, a large force of soldiers was stationed there. The French called off their invasion following the Battle of Quiberon Bay.

===19th century===

In the spring of 1817, the twenty-one year old John Keats spent time in Carisbrooke and Shanklin, where he found inspiration in the countryside and coast, and worked on his long poem &quot;Endymion&quot;.

In the mid-1840s, potato blight was first found in the UK on the island, having arrived from Belgium. It was later transmitted to Ireland.

In the 1860s, what remains in real terms the most expensive ever government spending project saw fortifications built on the island and in the Solent, as well as elsewhere along the south coast, including the Palmerston Forts, The Needles Batteries, and Fort Victoria, because of fears about possible French invasion.

The future Queen Victoria spent childhood holidays on the island and became fond of it. When she became queen, she made Osborne House her winter home. Subsequently, the island became a fashionable holiday resort for many, including Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Julia Margaret Cameron, and Charles Dickens (who wrote much of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; there), as well as the French painter Berthe Morisot and members of European royalty.

Until the queen&#x27;s example, the island had been rural, with most people employed in farming, fishing, or boat-building. The boom in tourism, spurred by growing wealth and leisure time and by Victoria&#x27;s presence, led to the significant urban development of the island&#x27;s coastal resorts. As one report summarises, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s regular presence on the island helped put the Isle of Wight &#x27;on the map&#x27; as a Victorian holiday and wellness destination ... and her former residence Osborne House is now one of the most visited attractions on the island.&quot; While on the island, the queen used a bathing machine that could be wheeled into the water on Osborne Beach; inside the small wooden hut, she could undress and then bathe, without being visible to others. Her machine had a changing room and a WC with plumbing. The refurbished machine is now displayed at the beach.

On 14 January 1878, Alexander Graham Bell demonstrated an early version of the telephone to the queen, placing calls to Cowes, Southampton, and London. These were the first publicly-witnessed long-distance telephone calls in the UK. The queen tried the device and considered the process to be &quot;quite extraordinary&quot; although the sound was &quot;rather faint&quot;. She later asked to buy the equipment that was used, but Bell offered to make &quot;a set of telephones&quot; specifically for her.

The world&#x27;s first radio station was set up by Guglielmo Marconi in 1897, during her reign, at the Needles Battery, at the western tip of the island. A high mast was erected near the Royal Needles Hotel as part of an experiment on communicating with ships at sea. That location is now the site of the Marconi Monument. In 1898 the first paid wireless telegram (called a &quot;Marconigram&quot;) was sent from this station, and the island was for some time the home of the National Wireless Museum near Ryde.

Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on 22 January 1901 at 81.

===20th century and later===

During the Second World War, the island was frequently bombed. With its proximity to German-occupied France, the island hosted observation stations, transmitters, and the RAF radar station at Ventnor. Adolf Hitler personally suggested an invasion of the Isle of Wight as a supplementary operation for Operation Sealion, and the possibility of an invasion was incorporated into Fuhrer Directive 16. Field Marshal Alan Brooke, in charge of defending the UK during 1940, was sceptical about being able to hold the island in the face of an invasion, instead considering that British forces would retreat to the western side of the island rather than commit forces against what might be a diversionary landing. In the end no invasion of the island was carried out as German naval commanders feared any invasion force might be cut off by British naval forces, particularly Royal Navy submarines.

The island was the starting point for one of the earlier Operation Pluto pipelines to feed fuel to Europe after the Normandy landings.

The Needles Battery was used to develop and test the Black Arrow and Black Knight space rockets, which were subsequently launched from Woomera, Australia.
The Isle of Wight Festival was a large rock festival near Afton Down, West Wight, in August 1970, following two smaller events in 1968 and 1969. The 1970 show was one of the last public performances by Jimi Hendrix and attracted somewhere between 600,000 and 700,000 attendees. The festival was revived in 2002 in a different format and is now an annual event.

On 26 October 2020, an oil tanker, the &quot;Nave Andromeda&quot;, suspected to have been hijacked by Nigerian stowaways, was stormed southeast of the island by the Special Boat Service. Seven people believed to be Nigerians seeking UK asylum were handed over to Hampshire Police.

== Governance ==
The island had a single Member of Parliament until 2024. The Isle of Wight constituency covered the entire island, with 138,300 permanent residents in 2011, being one of the most populated constituencies in the United Kingdom (more than 50% above the English average). Following passage of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies was to have changed this, but this was deferred to no earlier than October 2022 by the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013. Thus the single constituency remained for the 2015, 2017 and 2019 general elections. However, two separate constituencies, Isle of Wight East and Isle of Wight West were created for the island under the 2022 review, and were first contested in the 2024 general election.

The Isle of Wight is a ceremonial and non-metropolitan county. Since the abolition of its two borough councils and restructuring of the Isle of Wight County Council into the new Isle of Wight Council in 1995, it has been administered by a single tier Island Council which has the same powers as a unitary authority in England.

There have been small regionalist movements: the Vectis National Party and the Isle of Wight Party; but they have attracted little support at elections.

== Geography and environment ==

The Isle of Wight is situated between the Solent and the English Channel, is roughly rhomboid in shape, and covers an area of . Slightly more than half, mainly in the west, is designated as the Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The island has of farmland, of developed areas, and of coastline. Its landscapes are diverse, leading to its oft-quoted description as &quot;England in miniature&quot;. In June 2019 the whole island was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, recognising the sustainable relationships between its residents and the local environment.

West Wight is predominantly rural, with dramatic coastlines dominated by the chalk downland ridge, running across the whole island and ending in the Needles stacks. The southwestern quarter is commonly referred to as the Back of the Wight, and has a unique character. The highest point on the island is St Boniface Down in the south east, which at is a marilyn. The most notable habitats on the rest of the island are probably the soft cliffs and sea ledges, which are scenic features, important for wildlife, and internationally protected.

The island has three principal rivers. The River Medina flows north into the Solent, the Eastern Yar flows roughly northeast to Bembridge Harbour, and the Western Yar flows the short distance from Freshwater Bay to a relatively large estuary at Yarmouth. Without human intervention the sea might well have split the island into three: at the west end where a bank of pebbles separates Freshwater Bay from the marshy backwaters of the Western Yar east of Freshwater, and at the east end where a thin strip of land separates Sandown Bay from the marshy Eastern Yar basin.

The Undercliff between St Catherine&#x27;s Point and Bonchurch is the largest area of landslip morphology in western Europe.

The north coast is unusual in having four high tides each day, with a double high tide every twelve and a half hours. This arises because the western Solent is narrower than the eastern; the initial tide of water flowing from the west starts to ebb before the stronger flow around the south of the island returns through the eastern Solent to create a second high water.

===Geology===
The Isle of Wight is made up of a variety of rock types dating from early Cretaceous (around 127 million years ago) to the middle of the Palaeogene (around 30 million years ago). The geological structure is dominated by a large monocline which causes a marked change in age of strata from the northern younger Tertiary beds to the older Cretaceous beds of the south. This gives rise to a dip of almost 90 degrees in the chalk beds, seen best at the Needles.

The northern half of the island is mainly composed of clays, with the southern half formed of the chalk of the central east–west downs, as well as Upper and Lower Greensands and Wealden strata. These strata continue west from the island across the Solent into Dorset, forming the basin of Poole Harbour (Tertiary) and the Isle of Purbeck (Cretaceous) respectively. The chalky ridges of Wight and Purbeck were a single formation before they were breached by waters from the River Frome during the last ice age, forming the Solent and turning Wight into an island. The Needles, along with Old Harry Rocks on Purbeck, represent the edges of this breach.

All the rocks found on the island are sedimentary, such as limestones, mudstones and sandstones. They are rich in fossils; many can be seen exposed on beaches as the cliffs erode. Lignitic coal is present in small quantities within seams, and can be seen on the cliffs and shore at Whitecliff Bay. Fossilised molluscs have been found there, and also on the northern coast along with fossilised crocodiles, turtles and mammal bones; the youngest date back to around 30 million years ago.

The island is one of the most important areas in Europe for dinosaur fossils. The eroding cliffs often reveal previously hidden remains, particularly along the Back of the Wight. Dinosaur bones and fossilised footprints can be seen in and on the rocks exposed around the island&#x27;s beaches, especially at Yaverland and Compton Bay, from the strata of the Wessex Formation. As a result, the island has been nicknamed &quot;Dinosaur Island&quot; and Dinosaur Isle was established in 2001.

The area was affected by sea level changes during the repeated Quaternary glaciations. The island probably became separated from the mainland about 125,000 years ago, during the Ipswichian interglacial.

===Climate===
Like the rest of the UK, the island has an oceanic climate, but is somewhat milder and sunnier, which makes it a holiday destination. It also has a longer growing season. Lower Ventnor and the neighbouring Undercliff have a particular microclimate, because of their sheltered position south of the downs. The island enjoys 1,800–2,100 hours of sunshine a year. Some years have almost no snow in winter, and only a few days of hard frost. The island is in Hardiness zone 9.
===Flora and fauna===
The Isle of Wight is one of the few places in England where the European red squirrel is still flourishing, as no competitive grey squirrels are to be found there. Other mammalian species on the island include the European badger, hedgehog, least weasel, red fox and stoat, with the hedgehogs proving to be quite popular amongst locals and visitors alike; in 2019, a rescue and rehabilitation group was organised to assist them, called Save Our Hedgehogs Isle of Wight. The Isle is also home to several protected species, such as the European dormouse and several rare bats, including the western barbastelle.

There are several species of deer on the island, both endemic and non-native, all of which are monitored and surveyed annually by the organisation Isle of Wight Deer Conservation. According to the British Deer Society (BDS), the Isle of Wight Biodiversity Group would like to see the island&#x27;s ecosystems and flora preserved, one method being to keep the island &quot;deer-free&quot;; however, of the five types of deer documented, the European red deer and roe deer are truly native species, having been known to swim to the island from the mainland. 

The diminutive Chinese Reeve&#x27;s muntjac or barking deer—so-called due to its signature dog-like &quot;bark&quot; when threatened—is one of the smallest deer species on earth and is present on the island. The Asian sika (the second-largest species on the island) and Eurasian fallow deer also will journey to the island from the mainland, generally seen in very small herds, in pairs, or alone. Ultimately, all five of the deer species seen on the Isle of Wight are adept swimmers, thus any that are observed may or may not be long-term Island residents. Nonetheless, the island deer (that are present at any given time) tend to remain strategically hidden and are generally thought of as being difficult to spot, even on such a small island. Besides deer, there exists a colony of feral goats on Ventnor&#x27;s downs. 

The Glanville fritillary, a species of butterfly, has a distribution in the United Kingdom largely restricted to the edges of the island&#x27;s crumbling cliffs.

A competition in 2002 named the pyramidal orchid as the Isle of Wight&#x27;s county flower.

The occurrence of species and habitats of conservation importance in the island&#x27;s waters has led to the designation of a suite of marine protected areas seeking to protect these features, including marine conservation zones (MCZ&#x27;s) and special areas of conservation (SAC&#x27;s). The island&#x27;s marine environment also forms a component of its UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, and is part of the Western English Channel Important Marine Mammal Area (IMMA). 
===Settlements===

* Newport is the centrally located county town, with a population of about 25,000 and the island&#x27;s main shopping area. Located next to the River Medina, Newport Quay was a busy port until the mid-19th century.
* Ryde, the largest town with a population of about 30,000, is in the northeast. It is Victorian with the oldest seaside pier in England and miles of sandy and pebble beaches.
* Cowes hosts the annual Cowes Week and is an international sailing centre. 
* East Cowes is famous for Osborne House, Norris Castle and as the home from 1929 to 1964 of Saunders-Roe, the historic aircraft, flying boat, rocket and hovercraft company.
* Sandown is a popular seaside resort. It is home to the Wildheart Animal Sanctuary, formerly the Isle of Wight Zoo, the Dinosaur Isle geological museum and one of the island&#x27;s two 18-hole golf courses.
* Shanklin, just south of Sandown, attracts tourists with its high summer sunshine levels, sandy beaches, Shanklin Chine and the old village.
* Ventnor, built on the steep slopes of St Boniface Down on the south coast of the island, leads down to a bay that attracts many tourists. Ventnor Haven is a small harbour.
==Economy==
===Socio-economic data===
The table below shows the regional gross value (in millions of pounds) added by the Isle of Wight economy, at current prices, compiled by the Office for National Statistics.

According to the 2011 census, the island&#x27;s population of 138,625 lives in 61,085 households, giving an average household size of 2.27 people.

41% of households own their home outright and a further 29% own with a mortgage, so in total 70% of households are owned (compared to 68% for South East England).

Compared to South East England, the island has fewer children (19% aged 0–17 compared to 22% for the South East) and more elderly (24% aged 65+ compared to 16% for the South East), giving an average age of 44 years for an island resident compared to 40 in South East England.

===Industry and agriculture===

The largest industry on the island is tourism, but it also has a significant agriculture including sheep, dairy farming and arable crops. Traditional agricultural commodities are more difficult to market off the island because of transport costs, but local farmers have succeeded in exploiting some specialist markets, with the higher price of such products absorbing the transport costs. One of the most successful agricultural sectors is now the growing of crops under cover, particularly salad crops including tomatoes and cucumbers. The island has a warmer climate and a longer growing season than much of the United Kingdom. Garlic has been grown in Newchurch for many years, and is, in part, exported to France. This has led to the establishment of an annual Garlic Festival at Newchurch, which is one of the largest events of the local calendar.

A favourable climate supports two vineyards, including one of the oldest in the British Isles at Adgestone. Lavender is grown for its oil. The largest agricultural sector has been dairying, but due to low milk prices and strict legislation for UK milk producers, the dairy industry has been in decline: there were nearly 150 producers in the mid-1980s, but now just 24.

Maritime industries, especially the making of sailcloth and boat building, have long been associated with the island, although this has diminished in recent years. GKN operates what began as the British Hovercraft Corporation, a subsidiary of (and known latterly as) Westland Aircraft, although they have reduced the extent of plant and workforce and sold the main site. Previously it had been the independent company Saunders-Roe, one of the island&#x27;s most notable historic firms that produced many flying boats and the world&#x27;s first hovercraft.

Another manufacturing activity is in composite materials, used by boat-builders and the wind turbine manufacturer Vestas, which has a wind turbine blade factory and testing facilities in West Medina Mills and East Cowes.

Bembridge Airfield is the home of Britten-Norman, manufacturers of the Islander and Trislander aircraft. This is shortly to become the site of the European assembly line for Cirrus light aircraft. The Norman Aeroplane Company is a smaller aircraft manufacturing company operating in Sandown. There have been three other firms that built planes on the island.

In 2005, Northern Petroleum began exploratory drilling for oil at its Sandhills-2 borehole at Porchfield, but ceased operations in October that year after failing to find significant reserves.

====Breweries====
There are three breweries on the island. Goddards Brewery in Ryde opened in 1993. David Yates, who was head brewer of the Island Brewery, started brewing as Yates Brewery at the Inn at St Lawrence in 2000. Ventnor Brewery, which closed in 2009, was the last incarnation of Burt&#x27;s Brewery, brewing since the 1840s in Ventnor. Until the 1960s most pubs were owned by Mews Brewery, situated in Newport near the old railway station, but it closed and the pubs were taken over by Strong&#x27;s, and then by Whitbread. By some accounts Mews beer was apt to be rather cloudy and dark. In the 19th century they pioneered the use of screw top cans for export to British India.

===Services===

====Tourism and heritage====

The island&#x27;s heritage is a major asset that has for many years supported its tourist economy. Holidays focused on natural heritage, including wildlife and geology, are becoming an alternative to the traditional British seaside holiday, which went into decline in the second half of the 20th century due to the increased affordability of foreign holidays. The island is still an important destination for coach tours from other parts of the United Kingdom.
Tourism is still the largest industry, and most island towns and villages offer hotels, hostels and camping sites. In 1999, it hosted 2.7 million visitors, with 1.5 million staying overnight, and 1.2 million day visits; only 150,000 of these were from abroad. Between 1993 and 2000, visits increased at an average rate of 3% per year.

At the turn of the 19th century the island had ten pleasure piers, including two at Ryde and a &quot;chain pier&quot; at Seaview. The Victoria Pier in Cowes succeeded the earlier Royal Pier but was itself removed in 1960. The piers at Ryde, Seaview, Sandown, Shanklin and Ventnor originally served a coastal steamer service that operated from Southsea on the mainland. The piers at Seaview, Shanklin, Ventnor and Alum Bay were all destroyed by various storms during the 20th century; only the railway pier at Ryde and the piers at Sandown, Totland Bay (currently closed to the public) and Yarmouth survive.

Blackgang Chine is the oldest theme park in Britain, opened in 1843. The skeleton of a dead whale that its founder Alexander Dabell found in 1844 is still on display.

As well as its more traditional attractions, the island is often host to walking or cycling holidays through the attractive scenery. An annual walking festival has attracted considerable interest. The Isle of Wight Coastal Path follows the coastline as far as possible, deviating onto roads where the route along the coast is impassable.

The tourist board for the island is Visit Isle of Wight, a non-profit company. It is the Destination Management Organisation for the Isle of Wight, a public and private sector partnership led by the private sector, and consists of over 1,200 companies, including the ferry operators, the local bus company, rail operator and tourism providers working together to collectively promote the island. Its income is derived from the Wight BID, a business improvement district levy fund.

A major contributor to the local economy is sailing and marine-related tourism.

Summer Camp at Camp Beaumont is an attraction at the old Bembridge School site.

====Media====
The main local newspaper purchased is the &quot;Isle of Wight County Press&quot;. Its circulation has declined over the years, estimated at 11,575 in 2024, especially after it was taken over by Newsquest in July 2017. In 2018 a new free newspaper was launched, the &quot;Isle of Wight Observer&quot;.

On-line news websites include &quot;Island Echo&quot;, launched in May 2012, and &quot;On the Wight&quot;.

The island has a local commercial radio station and a community radio station: commercial station Isle of Wight Radio has broadcast in the medium-wave band since 1990 and on 107.0 MHz (with three smaller transmitters on 102.0 MHz) FM since 1998, as well as streaming on the Internet. Community station Vectis Radio has broadcast online since 2010, and in 2017 started broadcasting on FM 104.6. The station operates from the Riverside Centre in Newport. The island is also covered by a number of local stations on the mainland, including the BBC station BBC Radio Solent broadcast from Southampton. The island&#x27;s not-for-profit community radio station Angel Radio opened in 2007. Angel Radio began broadcasting on 91.5 MHz from studios in Cowes and a transmitter near Newport.

Important broadcasting infrastructure includes Chillerton Down transmitting station with a mast that is the tallest structure on the island, and Rowridge transmitting station, which broadcasts the main television signal both locally and for most of Hampshire and parts of Dorset and West Sussex.

== Culture ==

===Language and dialect===
The local accent is similar to the traditional dialect of Hampshire, featuring the dropping of some consonants and an emphasis on longer vowels. It is similar to the West Country dialects heard in South West England, but less pronounced.

The island has its own local and regional words. Some, such as &quot;nipper/nips&quot; (a young male person), are still sometimes used and shared with neighbouring areas of the mainland. A few are unique to the island, for example &quot;overner&quot; and &quot;caulkhead&quot; (see below). Others are more obscure and now used mainly for comic emphasis, such as &quot;mallishag&quot; (meaning &quot;caterpillar&quot;), &quot;gurt&quot; meaning &quot;large&quot;, &quot;nammit&quot; (a mid-morning snack) and &quot;gallybagger&quot; (&quot;scarecrow&quot;, and now the name of a local cheese).

===Identity===
There remains occasional confusion between the Isle of Wight as a county and its former position within Hampshire. The island was regarded and administered as a part of Hampshire until 1 April 1890, when its distinct identity was recognised with the formation of Isle of Wight County Council (see also &quot;Politics of the Isle of Wight&quot;). However, it remained a part of Hampshire until the local government reforms of 1974, when it became a full ceremonial county with its own Lord Lieutenant.

In January 2009, the first general flag for the county was accepted by the Flag Institute.

Island residents are sometimes referred to as &quot;Vectensians&quot;, &quot;Vectians&quot; or, if born on the island, &quot;caulkheads&quot;. One theory is that this last comes from the once prevalent local industry of caulking or sealing wooden boats; the term became attached to islanders either because they were so employed, or as a derisory term for perceived unintelligent labourers from elsewhere. The term &quot;overner&quot; is used for island residents originating from the mainland (an abbreviated form of &quot;overlander&quot;, which is an archaic term for &quot;outsider&quot; still found in parts of Australia).

Residents refer to the island as &quot;The Island&quot;, as did Jane Austen in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, and sometimes to the UK mainland as &quot;North Island&quot;.

To promote the island&#x27;s identity and culture, the High Sheriff, Robin Courage, founded an Isle of Wight Day; the first was held on 24 September 2016.

===Sport===
Sport plays a key part of culture on the Isle of Wight. Sports include golf, marathon, cycling and sailing.

===Music===
The island is home to the Isle of Wight Festival and until 2016, Bestival, before it was relocated to Lulworth Estate in Dorset. In 1970, the festival was headlined by Jimi Hendrix attracting an audience of 600,000, some six times the local population at the time. It is the home of the bands The Bees, Trixie&#x27;s Big Red Motorbike, Level 42, and Wet Leg.

== Landmarks ==


==Transport==

The Isle of Wight has of roadway. It does not have a motorway, although there is a short stretch of dual carriageway towards the north of Newport near the hospital and prison.

A comprehensive bus network operated by Southern Vectis links most settlements, with Newport as its central hub.

Journeys away from the island involve a ferry journey. Car ferry and passenger catamaran services are run by Wightlink and Red Funnel, and a hovercraft passenger service (the only such remaining in the world) by Hovertravel.

The island formerly had its own railway network of over , but only one line remains in regular use. The Island Line is part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Rail network, running a little under from to , where there is a connecting ferry service to station on the mainland network. The line was opened by the Isle of Wight Railway in 1864, and from 1996 to 2007 was run by the smallest train operating company on the network, Island Line Trains. It is notable for utilising old ex-London Underground rolling stock, due to the small size of its tunnels and unmodernised signalling. Branching off the Island Line at is the heritage Isle of Wight Steam Railway, which runs for to the outskirts of on the former line to Newport.

There are two airfields for general aviation, Isle of Wight Airport at Sandown and Bembridge Airport.

The island has over of cycleways, many of which can be enjoyed off-road. The principal trails are:
* The Sunshine Trail, which is a circular route linking Sandown, Shanklin, Godshill, and Wroxall of ;
* The Red Squirrel Trail, a track between Cowes and Sandown that is in total;
* The Round the Island Cycle Route of .

== Prisons ==
The Isle of Wight is near the densely populated south of England, yet separated from the mainland. This position led to it hosting three prisons: Albany, Camp Hill and Parkhurst, all located outside Newport near the main road to Cowes. Albany and Parkhurst were among the few Category A prisons in the UK until they were downgraded in the 1990s. The downgrading of Parkhurst was precipitated by a major escape: three prisoners (two murderers and a blackmailer) escaped from the prison on 3 January 1995 for four days, before being recaptured. Parkhurst enjoyed notoriety as one of the toughest jails in the United Kingdom, and housed many notable inmates including the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, New Zealand drug lord Terry Clark and the Kray twins.

Camp Hill is located adjacent but to the west of Albany and Parkhurst, on the very edge of Parkhurst Forest, having been converted first to a borstal and later to a Category C prison. It was built on the site of an army camp (both Albany and Parkhurst were barracks); there is a small estate of tree-lined roads with the former officers&#x27; quarters (now privately owned) to the south and east. Camp Hill closed as a prison in March 2013.

The management of all three prisons was merged into a single administration, under HMP Isle of Wight in April 2009.

==Education==
There are 69 local education authority-maintained schools on the Isle of Wight, and two independent schools. As a rural community, many of these are small and with fewer pupils than in urban areas. The Isle of Wight College is located on the outskirts of Newport.

From September 2010, there was a transition period from the three-tier system of primary, middle and high schools to the two-tier system that is usual in England. Some schools have now closed, such as Chale C.E. Primary. Others have become &quot;federated&quot;, such as Brading C.E. Primary and St Helen&#x27;s Primary. Christ the King College started as two &quot;middle schools&quot;, Trinity Middle School and Archbishop King Catholic Middle School, but has now been converted into a dual-faith secondary school and sixth form.

Since September 2011 five new secondary schools, with an age range of 11 to 18 years, replaced the island&#x27;s high schools (as a part of the previous three-tier system).

==Notable people==
Notable residents have included:

===17th century and earlier===

* King Arwald, last pagan king in England

<doc id="15107" wikidata="Q13162" url="?curid=15107" title="Internet Control Message Protocol">
<text>The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with another IP address. For example, an error is indicated when a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. ICMP differs from transport protocols such as TCP and UDP in that it is not typically used to exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools like ping and traceroute).

A separate Internet Control Message Protocol (called ICMPv6) is used with IPv6.

== Technical details ==
ICMP is part of the Internet protocol suite as defined in RFC 792. ICMP messages are typically used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors in IP operations (as specified in RFC 1122). ICMP errors are directed to the source IP address of the originating packet.

For example, every device (such as an intermediate router) forwarding an IP datagram first decrements the time to live (TTL) field in the IP header by one. If the resulting TTL is 0, the packet is discarded and an ICMP &quot;time exceeded&quot; message is sent to the datagram&#x27;s source address.

Many commonly used network utilities are based on ICMP messages. The traceroute command can be implemented by transmitting IP datagrams with specially set IP TTL header fields, and looking for ICMP time exceeded in transit and &quot;destination unreachable&quot; messages generated in response. The related ping utility is implemented using the ICMP &quot;echo request&quot; and &quot;echo reply&quot; messages.

ICMP uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher-level protocol, however, ICMP is actually an integral part of IP. Although ICMP messages are contained within standard IP packets, ICMP messages are usually processed as a special case, distinguished from normal IP processing. In many cases, it is necessary to inspect the contents of the ICMP message and deliver the appropriate error message to the application responsible for transmitting the IP packet that prompted the ICMP message to be sent.

ICMP is a network-layer protocol; this makes it a layer 3 protocol in the seven-layer OSI model. Based on the four-layer TCP/IP model, ICMP is an internet-layer protocol, which makes it a layer 2 protocol in the Internet Standard RFC 1122 TCP/IP four-layer model or a layer 3 protocol in the modern five-layer TCP/IP protocol definitions (by Kozierok, Comer, Tanenbaum, Forouzan, Kurose, Stallings).

There is no TCP or UDP port number associated with ICMP packets as these numbers are associated with the transport layer above.

==Datagram structure==
The ICMP packet is encapsulated in an IPv4 packet. The packet consists of header and data sections.

===Header===
The ICMP header starts after the IPv4 header and is identified by its protocol number, &quot;1&quot;. All ICMP packets have an eight-byte header and variable-sized data section. The first four bytes of the header have fixed format, while the last four bytes depend on the type and code of the ICMP packet.

;
;

===Data===
ICMP error messages contain a data section that includes a copy of the entire IPv4 header, plus at least the first eight bytes of data from the IPv4 packet that caused the error message. The length of ICMP error messages should not exceed 576 bytes. This data is used by the host to match the message to the appropriate process. If a higher level protocol uses port numbers, they are assumed to be in the first eight bytes of the original datagram&#x27;s data.

The variable size of the ICMP packet data section has been exploited. In the &quot;Ping of death&quot;, large or fragmented ICMP packets are used for denial-of-service attacks. ICMP data can also be used to create covert channels for communication. These channels are known as ICMP tunnels.

==Control messages==
Control messages are identified by the value in the &quot;type&quot; field. The &quot;code&quot; field gives additional context information for the message. Some control messages have been deprecated since the protocol was first introduced.
===Source quench===
&quot;Source Quench&quot; requests that the sender decrease the rate of messages sent to a router or host. This message may be generated if a router or host does not have sufficient buffer space to process the request, or may occur if the router or host buffer is approaching its limit.

Data is sent at a very high speed from a host or from several hosts at the same time to a particular router on a network. Although a router has buffering capabilities, the buffering is limited to within a specified range. The router cannot queue any more data than the capacity of the limited buffering space. Thus if the queue gets filled up, incoming data is discarded until the queue is no longer full. But as no acknowledgement mechanism is present in the network layer, the client does not know whether the data has reached the destination successfully. Hence some remedial measures should be taken by the network layer to avoid these kind of situations. These measures are referred to as source quench.

In a source quench mechanism, the router sees that the incoming data rate is much faster than the outgoing data rate, and sends an ICMP message to the clients, informing them that they should slow down their data transfer speeds or wait for a certain amount of time before attempting to send more data. When a client receives this message, it automatically slows down the outgoing data rate or waits for a sufficient amount of time, which enables the router to empty the queue. Thus the source quench ICMP message acts as flow control in the network layer.

Since research suggested that &quot;ICMP Source Quench [was] an ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion&quot;, routers&#x27; creation of source quench messages was deprecated in 1995 by RFC 1812. Furthermore, forwarding of and any kind of reaction to (flow control actions) source quench messages was deprecated from 2012 by RFC 6633.

Where:
:Type must be set to 4
:Code must be set to 0
:IP header and additional data is used by the sender to match the reply with the associated request

===Redirect===
&quot;Redirect&quot; requests data packets be sent on an alternative route. ICMP Redirect is a mechanism for routers to convey routing information to hosts. The message informs a host to update its routing information (to send packets on an alternative route). If a host tries to send data through a router (R1) and R1 sends the data on another router (R2) and a direct path from the host to R2 is available (that is, the host and R2 are on the same subnetwork), then R1 will send a redirect message to inform the host that the best route for the destination is via R2. The host should then change its route information and send packets for that destination directly to R2. The router will still send the original datagram to the intended destination. However, if the datagram contains routing information, this message will not be sent even if a better route is available. RFC 1122 states that redirects should only be sent by gateways and should not be sent by Internet hosts.

Where:
: Type must be set to 5.
: Code specifies the reason for the redirection, and may be one of the following:
: IP address is the 32-bit address of the gateway to which the redirection should be sent.
: IP header and additional data is included to allow the host to match the reply with the request that caused the redirection reply.

===Time exceeded===
&quot;Time Exceeded&quot; is generated by a gateway to inform the source of a discarded datagram due to the time to live field reaching zero. A time exceeded message may also be sent by a host if it fails to reassemble a fragmented datagram within its time limit.

Time exceeded messages are used by the traceroute utility to identify gateways on the path between two hosts.

Where:
:Type must be set to 11
:Code specifies the reason for the &quot;time exceeded&quot; message, include the following:
:IP header and first 64 bits of the original payload are used by the source host to match the time exceeded message to the discarded datagram. For higher-level protocols such as UDP and TCP the 64-bit payload will include the source and destination ports of the discarded packet.

===Timestamp===
&quot;Timestamp&quot; is used for time synchronization. The originating timestamp is set to the time (in milliseconds since midnight) the sender last touched the packet. The receive and transmit timestamps are not used.

Where:
:Type must be set to 13
:Code must be set to 0
:Identifier and Sequence Number can be used by the client to match the timestamp reply with the timestamp request.
:Originate timestamp is the number of milliseconds since midnight Universal Time (UT). If a UT reference is not available the most-significant bit can be set to indicate a non-standard time value.

===Timestamp reply===
&quot;Timestamp Reply&quot; replies to a &quot;Timestamp&quot; message. It consists of the originating timestamp sent by the sender of the &quot;Timestamp&quot; as well as a receive timestamp indicating when the &quot;Timestamp&quot; was received and a transmit timestamp indicating when the &quot;Timestamp reply&quot; was sent.

Where:
:Type must be set to 14
:Code must be set to 0
:Identifier and Sequence number can be used by the client to match the reply with the request that caused the reply.
:Originate timestamp is the time the sender last touched the message before sending it.
:Receive timestamp is the time the echoer first touched it on receipt.
:Transmit timestamp is the time the echoer last touched the message on sending it.

:All timestamps are in units of milliseconds since midnight UT. If the time is not available in milliseconds or cannot be provided with respect to midnight UT then any time can be inserted in a timestamp provided the high order bit of the timestamp is also set to indicate this non-standard value.

The use of Timestamp and Timestamp Reply messages to synchronize the clocks of Internet nodes has largely been replaced by the UDP-based Network Time Protocol and the Precision Time Protocol.

===Address mask request===
&quot;Address mask request&quot; is normally sent by a host to a router in order to obtain an appropriate subnet mask.

Recipients should reply to this message with an &quot;Address mask reply&quot; message.

Where:
:Type must be set to 17
:Code must be set to 0
:Address mask can be set to 0

ICMP Address Mask Request may be used as a part of reconnaissance attack to gather information on the target network, therefore ICMP Address Mask Reply is disabled by default on Cisco IOS.

===Address mask reply===
&quot;Address mask reply&quot; is used to reply to an address mask request message with an appropriate subnet mask.

Where:
:Type must be set to 18
:Code must be set to 0
:Address mask should be set to the subnet mask

===Destination unreachable===
&quot;Destination unreachable&quot; is generated by the host or its inbound gateway to inform the client that the destination is unreachable for some reason. Reasons for this message may include: the physical connection to the host does not exist (distance is infinite); the indicated protocol or port is not active; the data must be fragmented but the &#x27;don&#x27;t fragment&#x27; flag is on. Unreachable TCP ports notably respond with TCP RST rather than a &quot;destination unreachable&quot; type 3 as might be expected. &quot;Destination unreachable&quot; is never reported for IP multicast transmissions.

<text>In mathematics, the inverse limit (also called the projective limit) is a construction that allows one to &quot;glue together&quot; several related objects, the precise gluing process being specified by morphisms between the objects. Thus, inverse limits can be defined in any category although their existence depends on the category that is considered. They are a special case of the concept of limit in category theory. 

By working in the dual category, that is by reversing the arrows, an inverse limit becomes a direct limit or &quot;inductive limit&quot;, and a &quot;limit&quot; becomes a colimit.

== Formal definition ==

=== Algebraic objects ===

We start with the definition of an inverse system (or projective system) of groups and homomorphisms. Let formula_1 be a directed poset (not all authors require &quot;I&quot; to be directed). Let (&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;)&quot;i&quot;∈&quot;I&quot; be a family of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms formula_2 for all formula_3 (note the order) with the following properties:
# formula_4 is the identity on formula_5,
# formula_6
Then the pair formula_7 is called an inverse system of groups and morphisms over formula_8, and the morphisms formula_9 are called the transition morphisms of the system.

We define the inverse limit of the inverse system formula_7 as a particular subgroup of the direct product of the &quot;formula_5&quot;&#x27;s:

:formula_12

The inverse limit formula_13 comes equipped with &quot;natural projections&quot; which pick out the th component of the direct product for each formula_14 in formula_8. The inverse limit and the natural projections satisfy a universal property described in the next section.

This same construction may be carried out if the formula_5&#x27;s are sets, semigroups, topological spaces, rings, modules (over a fixed ring), algebras (over a fixed ring), etc., and the homomorphisms are morphisms in the corresponding category. The inverse limit will also belong to that category.

=== General definition ===

The inverse limit can be defined abstractly in an arbitrary category by means of a universal property. Let formula_17 be an inverse system of objects and morphisms in a category &quot;C&quot; (same definition as above). The inverse limit of this system is an object &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot; together with morphisms &quot;i&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; (called &quot;projections&quot;) satisfying &quot;i&quot; = formula_9 ∘ &quot;j&quot; for all &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;j&quot;. The pair (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;i&quot;) must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair (&quot;Y&quot;, ψ&quot;i&quot;) there exists a unique morphism &quot;u&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;X&quot; such that the diagram

commutes for all &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;j&quot;. The inverse limit is often denoted
:formula_19
with the inverse system formula_20 and the canonical projections formula_21 being understood.

In some categories, the inverse limit of certain inverse systems does not exist. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given any two inverse limits &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X&quot;&#x27; of an inverse system, there exists a &quot;unique&quot; isomorphism &quot;X&quot;′ → &quot;X&quot; commuting with the projection maps.

Inverse systems and inverse limits in a category &quot;C&quot; admit an alternative description in terms of functors. Any partially ordered set &quot;I&quot; can be considered as a small category where the morphisms consist of arrows &quot;i&quot; → &quot;j&quot; if and only if &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;j&quot;. An inverse system is then just a contravariant functor &quot;I&quot; → &quot;C&quot;. Let formula_22 be the category of these functors (with natural transformations as morphisms). An object &quot;X&quot; of &quot;C&quot; can be considered a trivial inverse system, where all objects are equal to &quot;X&quot; and all arrow are the identity of &quot;X&quot;. This defines a &quot;trivial functor&quot; from &quot;C&quot; to formula_23 The inverse limit, if it exists, is defined as a right adjoint of this trivial functor.

== Examples ==
* The ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers is the inverse limit of the rings formula_24 (see modular arithmetic) with the index set being the natural numbers with the usual order, and the morphisms being &quot;take remainder&quot;. That is, one considers sequences of integers formula_25 such that each element of the sequence &quot;projects&quot; down to the previous ones, namely, that formula_26 whenever formula_27 The natural topology on the &quot;p&quot;-adic integers is the one implied here, namely the product topology with cylinder sets as the open sets.
* The &quot;p&quot;-adic solenoid is the inverse limit of the topological groups formula_28 with the index set being the natural numbers with the usual order, and the morphisms being &quot;take remainder&quot;. That is, one considers sequences of real numbers formula_29 such that each element of the sequence &quot;projects&quot; down to the previous ones, namely, that formula_30 whenever formula_27 Its elements are exactly of form formula_32, where formula_33 is a &quot;p&quot;-adic integer, and formula_34 is the &quot;remainder&quot;.
* The ring formula_35 of formal power series over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; can be thought of as the inverse limit of the rings formula_36, indexed by the natural numbers as usually ordered, with the morphisms from formula_37 to formula_36 given by the natural projection.
* Pro-finite groups are defined as inverse limits of (discrete) finite groups.
* Let the index set &quot;I&quot; of an inverse system (&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, formula_9) have a greatest element &quot;m&quot;. Then the natural projection &quot;m&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot;&quot;m&quot; is an isomorphism.
* In the category of sets, every inverse system has an inverse limit, which can be constructed in an elementary manner as a subset of the product of the sets forming the inverse system. The inverse limit of any inverse system of non-empty finite sets is non-empty. This is a generalization of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma in graph theory and may be proved with Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, viewing the finite sets as compact discrete spaces, and then applying the finite intersection property characterization of compactness.
* In the category of topological spaces, every inverse system has an inverse limit. It is constructed by placing the initial topology on the underlying set-theoretic inverse limit. This is known as the limit topology.
** The set of infinite strings is the inverse limit of the set of finite strings, and is thus endowed with the limit topology. As the original spaces are discrete, the limit space is totally disconnected. This is one way of realizing the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers and the Cantor set (as infinite strings).

==Derived functors of the inverse limit==

For an abelian category &quot;C&quot;, the inverse limit functor
:formula_40
is left exact. If &quot;I&quot; is ordered (not simply partially ordered) and countable, and &quot;C&quot; is the category Ab of abelian groups, the Mittag-Leffler condition is a condition on the transition morphisms &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot; that ensures the exactness of formula_41. Specifically, Eilenberg constructed a functor
:formula_42
(pronounced &quot;lim one&quot;) such that if (&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot;), (&quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;g&quot;&quot;ij&quot;), and (&quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;h&quot;&quot;ij&quot;) are three inverse systems of abelian groups, and
:formula_43
is a short exact sequence of inverse systems, then
:formula_44
is an exact sequence in Ab.

===Mittag-Leffler condition===

If the ranges of the morphisms of an inverse system of abelian groups (&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot;) are &quot;stationary&quot;, that is, for every &quot;k&quot; there exists &quot;j&quot; ≥ &quot;k&quot; such that for all &quot;i&quot; ≥ &quot;j&quot; :formula_45 one says that the system satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition.

The name &quot;Mittag-Leffler&quot; for this condition was given by Bourbaki in their chapter on uniform structures for a similar result about inverse limits of complete Hausdorff uniform spaces. Mittag-Leffler used a similar argument in the proof of Mittag-Leffler&#x27;s theorem.

The following situations are examples where the Mittag-Leffler condition is satisfied: 
* a system in which the morphisms &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot; are surjective
* a system of finite-dimensional vector spaces or finite abelian groups or modules of finite length or Artinian modules.

An example where formula_46 is non-zero is obtained by taking &quot;I&quot; to be the non-negative integers, letting &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;Z, &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot; = Z, and &quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot; / &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; = Z/&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;Z. Then
:formula_47
where Z&quot;p&quot; denotes the p-adic integers.

===Further results===

More generally, if &quot;C&quot; is an arbitrary abelian category that has enough injectives, then so does &quot;C&quot;&quot;I&quot;, and the right derived functors of the inverse limit functor can thus be defined. The &quot;n&quot;th right derived functor is denoted
:formula_48
In the case where &quot;C&quot; satisfies Grothendieck&#x27;s axiom (AB4*), Jan-Erik Roos generalized the functor lim1 on Ab&quot;I&quot; to series of functors limn such that
:formula_49
It was thought for almost 40 years that Roos had proved (in ) that lim1 &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 0 for (&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot;) an inverse system with surjective transition morphisms and &quot;I&quot; the set of non-negative integers (such inverse systems are often called &quot;Mittag-Leffler sequences&quot;). However, in 2002, Amnon Neeman and Pierre Deligne constructed an example of such a system in a category satisfying (AB4) (in addition to (AB4*)) with lim1 &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≠ 0. Roos has since shown (in &quot;Derived functors of inverse limits revisited&quot;) that his result is correct if &quot;C&quot; has a set of generators (in addition to satisfying (AB3) and (AB4*)).

Barry Mitchell has shown (in &quot;The cohomological dimension of a directed set&quot;) that if &quot;I&quot; has cardinality formula_50 (the &quot;d&quot;th infinite cardinal), then &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;lim is zero for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;d&quot; + 2. This applies to the &quot;I&quot;-indexed diagrams in the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules, with &quot;R&quot; a commutative ring; it is not necessarily true in an arbitrary abelian category (see Roos&#x27; &quot;Derived functors of inverse limits revisited&quot; for examples of abelian categories in which lim&quot;n&quot;, on diagrams indexed by a countable set, is nonzero for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1).

== Related concepts and generalizations ==

The categorical dual of an inverse limit is a direct limit (or inductive limit). More general concepts are the limits and colimits of category theory. The terminology is somewhat confusing: inverse limits are a class of limits, while direct limits are a class of colimits.

<text>Interplanetary spaceflight or interplanetary travel is spaceflight (crewed or uncrewed) between bodies within a single planetary system. Spaceflights become interplanetary by accelerating spacecrafts beyond orbital speed, reaching escape velocity relative to Earth at 11.2 km/s, entering heliocentric orbit, possibly accelerating further, often by performing gravity assist flybys at Earth and other planets. Most of today&#x27;s spaceflight remains Earth bound, with much less being interplanetary, all of which performed by uncrewed spacecrafts, and only just a few spaceflights having accelerated beyond, to system escape velocity, eventually performing interstellar spaceflight.

Uncrewed space probes have flown to all the observed planets in the Solar System as well as to dwarf planets Pluto and Ceres, and several asteroids. Orbiters and landers return more information than fly-by missions. Crewed flights have landed on the Moon and have been planned, from time to time, for Mars, Venus and Mercury. While many scientists appreciate the knowledge value that uncrewed flights provide, the value of crewed missions is more controversial. Science fiction writers propose a number of benefits, including the mining of asteroids, access to solar power, and room for colonization in the event of an Earth catastrophe.

A number of techniques have been developed to make interplanetary flights more economical. Advances in computing and theoretical science have already improved some techniques, while new proposals may lead to improvements in speed, fuel economy, and safety. Travel techniques must take into consideration the velocity changes necessary to travel from one body to another in the Solar System. For orbital flights, an additional adjustment must be made to match the orbital speed of the destination body. Other developments are designed to improve rocket launching and propulsion, as well as the use of non-traditional sources of energy. Using extraterrestrial resources for energy, oxygen, and water would reduce costs and improve life support systems.

Any crewed interplanetary flight must include certain design requirements. Life support systems must be capable of supporting human lives for extended periods of time. Preventative measures are needed to reduce exposure to radiation and ensure optimum reliability.

==Current achievements in interplanetary travel==
Remotely guided space probes have flown by all of the observed planets of the Solar System from Mercury to Neptune, with the &quot;New Horizons&quot; probe having flown by the dwarf planet Pluto and the &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft currently orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres. The most distant spacecraft, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; have left the Solar System as of 8 December 2018 while &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, and &quot;New Horizons&quot; are on course to leave it.

In general, planetary orbiters and landers return much more detailed and comprehensive information than fly-by missions. Space probes have been placed into orbit around all the five planets known to the ancients: The first being Venus (Venera 7, 1970), Mars (Mariner 9, 1971), Jupiter (&quot;Galileo&quot;, 1995), Saturn (&quot;Cassini/Huygens&quot;, 2004), and most recently Mercury (&quot;MESSENGER&quot;, March 2011), and have returned data about these bodies and their natural satellites.

The NEAR Shoemaker mission in 2000 orbited the large near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros, and was even successfully landed there, though it had not been designed with this maneuver in mind. The Japanese ion-drive spacecraft &quot;Hayabusa&quot; in 2005 also orbited the small near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa, landing on it briefly and returning grains of its surface material to Earth. Another ion-drive mission, &quot;Dawn&quot;, has orbited the large asteroid Vesta (July 2011 – September 2012) and later moved on to the dwarf planet Ceres, arriving in March 2015.

Remotely controlled landers such as Viking, Pathfinder and the two Mars Exploration Rovers have landed on the surface of Mars and several Venera and Vega spacecraft have landed on the surface of Venus, with the latter deploying balloons to the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. The &quot;Huygens&quot; probe successfully landed on Saturn&#x27;s moon, Titan.

No crewed missions have been sent to any planet of the Solar System. NASA&#x27;s Apollo program, however, landed twelve people on the Moon and returned them to Earth. The American Vision for Space Exploration, originally introduced by U.S. President George W. Bush and put into practice through the Constellation program, had as a long-term goal to eventually send human astronauts to Mars. However, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed cancelling the program in Fiscal Year 2011. An earlier project which received some significant planning by NASA included a crewed fly-by of Venus in the Manned Venus Flyby mission, but was cancelled when the Apollo Applications Program was terminated due to NASA budget cuts in the late 1960s.

==Reasons for interplanetary travel==

The costs and risk of interplanetary travel receive a lot of publicity—spectacular examples include the malfunctions or complete failures of probes without a human crew, such as Mars 96, Deep Space 2, and Beagle 2 (the article List of Solar System probes gives a full list).

Many astronomers, geologists and biologists believe that exploration of the Solar System provides knowledge that could not be gained by observations from Earth&#x27;s surface or from orbit around Earth. However, they disagree about whether human-crewed missions justify their cost and risk. Critics of human spaceflight argue that robotic probes are more cost-effective, producing more scientific knowledge per dollar spent; robots do not need costly life-support systems, can be sent on one-way missions, and are becoming more capable as artificial intelligence advances. Others argue that either astronauts or spacefaring scientists, advised by Earth-based scientists, can respond more flexibly and intelligently to new or unexpected features of whatever region they are exploring. 

Some members of the general public mainly value space activities for whatever tangible benefits they may deliver to themselves or to the human race as a whole. So far the only benefits of this type have been &quot;spin-off&quot; technologies which were developed for space missions and then were found to be at least as useful in other activities. However, public support, at least in the US, remains higher for basic scientific research than for human space flight; a 2023 survey found that Americans rate basic research as their third-highest priority for NASA, after monitoring Earth-endangering asteroids and understanding climate change. Support for scientific research is about four times higher than for human flight to the Moon or Mars.

Besides spinoffs, other practical motivations for interplanetary travel are more speculative. But science fiction writers have a fairly good track record in predicting future technologies—for example geosynchronous communications satellites (Arthur C. Clarke) and many aspects of computer technology (Mack Reynolds).

Many science fiction stories feature detailed descriptions of how people could extract minerals from asteroids and energy from sources including orbital solar panels (unhampered by clouds) and the very strong magnetic field of Jupiter. Some claim that such techniques may be the only way to provide rising standards of living without being stopped by pollution or by depletion of Earth&#x27;s resources (for example peak oil).

There are also non-scientific motives for human spaceflight, such as adventure or the belief that humans have a spiritually fated destiny in space.

Finally, establishing completely self-sufficient colonies in other parts of the Solar System could, if feasible, prevent the human species from being exterminated by several possible events (see Human extinction). One of these possible events is an asteroid impact like the one which may have resulted in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Although various Spaceguard projects monitor the Solar System for objects that might come dangerously close to Earth, current asteroid deflection strategies are crude and untested. To make the task more difficult, carbonaceous chondrites are rather sooty and therefore very hard to detect. Although carbonaceous chondrites are thought to be rare, some are very large and the suspected &quot;dinosaur-killer&quot; may have been a carbonaceous chondrite.

Some scientists, including members of the Space Studies Institute, argue that the vast majority of mankind eventually will live in space and will benefit from doing so.

==Economical travel techniques==
One of the main challenges in interplanetary travel is producing the very large velocity changes necessary to travel from one body to another in the Solar System.

Due to the Sun&#x27;s gravitational pull, a spacecraft moving farther from the Sun will slow down, while a spacecraft moving closer will speed up. Also, since any two planets are at different distances from the Sun, the planet from which the spacecraft starts is moving around the Sun at a different speed than the planet to which the spacecraft is travelling (in accordance with Kepler&#x27;s Third Law). Because of these facts, a spacecraft desiring to transfer to a planet closer to the Sun must decrease its speed with respect to the Sun by a large amount in order to intercept it, while a spacecraft traveling to a planet farther out from the Sun must increase its speed substantially. Then, if additionally the spacecraft wishes to enter into orbit around the destination planet (instead of just flying by it), it must match the planet&#x27;s orbital speed around the Sun, usually requiring another large velocity change.

Simply doing this by brute force – accelerating in the shortest route to the destination and then matching the planet&#x27;s speed – would require an extremely large amount of fuel. And the fuel required for producing these velocity changes has to be launched along with the payload, and therefore even more fuel is needed to put both the spacecraft and the fuel required for its interplanetary journey into orbit. Thus, several techniques have been devised to reduce the fuel requirements of interplanetary travel.

As an example of the velocity changes involved, a spacecraft travelling from low Earth orbit to Mars using a simple trajectory must first undergo a change in speed (also known as a delta-v), in this case an increase, of about 3.8 km/s. Then, after intercepting Mars, it must change its speed by another 2.3 km/s in order to match Mars&#x27; orbital speed around the Sun and enter an orbit around it. For comparison, launching a spacecraft into low Earth orbit requires a change in speed of about 9.5 km/s.

===Hohmann transfers===

For many years economical interplanetary travel meant using the Hohmann transfer orbit. Hohmann demonstrated that the lowest energy route between any two orbits is an elliptical &quot;orbit&quot; which forms a tangent to the starting and destination orbits. Once the spacecraft arrives, a second application of thrust will re-circularize the orbit at the new location. In the case of planetary transfers this means directing the spacecraft, originally in an orbit almost identical to Earth&#x27;s, so that the aphelion of the transfer orbit is on the far side of the Sun near the orbit of the other planet. A spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars via this method will arrive near Mars orbit in approximately 8.5 months, but because the orbital velocity is greater when closer to the center of mass (i.e. the Sun) and slower when farther from the center, the spacecraft will be traveling quite slowly and a small application of thrust is all that is needed to put it into a circular orbit around Mars. If the manoeuver is timed properly, Mars will be &quot;arriving&quot; under the spacecraft when this happens.

The Hohmann transfer applies to any two orbits, not just those with planets involved. For instance it is the most common way to transfer satellites into geostationary orbit, after first being &quot;parked&quot; in low Earth orbit. However, the Hohmann transfer takes an amount of time similar to ½ of the orbital period of the outer orbit, so in the case of the outer planets this is many years – too long to wait. It is also based on the assumption that the points at both ends are massless, as in the case when transferring between two orbits around Earth for instance. With a planet at the destination end of the transfer, calculations become considerably more difficult.

===Gravitational slingshot===

The gravitational slingshot technique uses the gravity of planets and moons to change the speed and direction of a spacecraft without using fuel. In typical example, a spacecraft is sent to a distant planet on a path that is much faster than what the Hohmann transfer would call for. This would typically mean that it would arrive at the planet&#x27;s orbit and continue past it. However, if there is a planet between the departure point and the target, it can be used to bend the path toward the target, and in many cases the overall travel time is greatly reduced. A prime example of this are the two crafts of the Voyager program, which used slingshot effects to change trajectories several times in the outer Solar System. It is difficult to use this method for journeys in the inner part of the Solar System, although it is possible to use other nearby planets such as Venus or even the Moon as slingshots in journeys to the outer planets.

This maneuver can only change an object&#x27;s velocity relative to a third, uninvolved object, – possibly the “centre of mass” or the Sun. There is no change in the velocities of the two objects involved in the maneuver relative to each other. The Sun cannot be used in a gravitational slingshot because it is stationary compared to rest of the Solar System, which orbits the Sun. It may be used to send a spaceship or probe into the galaxy because the Sun revolves around the center of the Milky Way.

===Powered slingshot===

A powered slingshot is the use of a rocket engine at or around closest approach to a body (periapsis). The use at this point multiplies up the effect of the delta-v, and gives a bigger effect than at other times.

===Fuzzy orbits===
Computers did not exist when Hohmann transfer orbits were first proposed (1925) and were slow, expensive and unreliable when gravitational slingshots were developed (1959). Recent advances in computing have made it possible to exploit many more features of the gravity fields of astronomical bodies and thus calculate even lower-cost trajectories. Paths have been calculated which link the Lagrange points of the various planets into the so-called Interplanetary Transport Network. Such &quot;fuzzy orbits&quot; use significantly less energy than Hohmann transfers but are much, much slower. They aren&#x27;t practical for human crewed missions because they generally take years or decades, but may be useful for high-volume transport of low-value commodities if humanity develops a space-based economy.

===Aerobraking===

Aerobraking uses the atmosphere of the target planet to slow down. It was first used on the Apollo program where the returning spacecraft did not enter Earth orbit but instead used a S-shaped vertical descent profile (starting with an initially steep descent, followed by a leveling out, followed by a slight climb, followed by a return to a positive rate of descent continuing to splash-down in the ocean) through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to reduce its speed until the parachute system could be deployed enabling a safe landing. Aerobraking does not require a thick atmosphere – for example most Mars landers use the technique, and Mars&#x27; atmosphere is only about 1% as thick as Earth&#x27;s.

Aerobraking converts the spacecraft&#x27;s kinetic energy into heat, so it requires a heatshield to prevent the craft from burning up. As a result, aerobraking is only helpful in cases where the fuel needed to transport the heatshield to the planet is less than the fuel that would be required to brake an unshielded craft by firing its engines. This can be addressed by creating heatshields from material available near the target.

==Improved technologies and methodologies==
Several technologies have been proposed which both save fuel and provide significantly faster travel than the traditional methodology of using Hohmann transfers. Some are still just theoretical, but over time, several of the theoretical approaches have been tested on spaceflight missions. For example, the Deep Space 1 mission was a successful test of an ion drive. These improved technologies typically focus on one or more of:
* Space propulsion systems with much better fuel economy. Such systems would make it possible to travel much faster while keeping the fuel cost within acceptable limits.
* Using solar energy and in-situ resource utilization to avoid or minimize the expensive task of shipping components and fuel up from the Earth&#x27;s surface, against the Earth&#x27;s gravity (see &quot;Using non-terrestrial resources&quot;, below).
* Novel methodologies of using energy at different locations or in different ways that can shorten transport time or reduce cost per unit mass of space transport

Besides making travel faster or cost less, such improvements could also allow greater design &quot;safety margins&quot; by reducing the imperative to make spacecraft lighter.

===Improved rocket concepts===

All rocket concepts are limited by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, of initial (&quot;M&quot;0, including fuel) to final (&quot;M&quot;1, fuel depleted) mass. The main consequence is that mission velocities of more than a few times the velocity of the rocket motor exhaust (with respect to the vehicle) rapidly become impractical, as the dry mass (mass of payload and rocket without fuel) falls to below 10% of the entire rocket&#x27;s wet mass (mass of rocket with fuel).

====Nuclear thermal and solar thermal rockets====

In a nuclear thermal rocket or solar thermal rocket a working fluid, usually hydrogen, is heated to a high temperature, and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The energy replaces the chemical energy of the reactive chemicals in a traditional rocket engine. Due to the low molecular mass and hence high thermal velocity of hydrogen these engines are at least twice as fuel efficient as chemical engines, even after including the weight of the reactor.

The US Atomic Energy Commission and NASA tested a few designs from 1959 to 1968. The NASA designs were conceived as replacements for the upper stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle, but the tests revealed reliability problems, mainly caused by the vibration and heating involved in running the engines at such high thrust levels. Political and environmental considerations make it unlikely such an engine will be used in the foreseeable future, since nuclear thermal rockets would be most useful at or near the Earth&#x27;s surface and the consequences of a malfunction could be disastrous. Fission-based thermal rocket concepts produce lower exhaust velocities than the electric and plasma concepts described below, and are therefore less attractive solutions. For applications requiring high thrust-to-weight ratio, such as planetary escape, nuclear thermal is potentially more attractive.

====Electric propulsion====
Electric propulsion systems use an external source such as a nuclear reactor or solar cells to generate electricity, which is then used to accelerate a chemically inert propellant to speeds far higher than achieved in a chemical rocket. Such drives produce feeble thrust, and are therefore unsuitable for quick maneuvers or for launching from the surface of a planet. But they are so economical in their use of
working mass that they can keep firing continuously for days or weeks, while chemical rockets use up reaction mass so quickly that they can only fire for seconds or minutes. Even a trip to the Moon is long enough for an electric propulsion system to outrun a chemical rocket – the Apollo missions took 3 days in each direction.

NASA&#x27;s Deep Space One was a very successful test of a prototype ion drive, which fired for a total of 678 days and enabled the probe to run down Comet Borrelly, a feat which would have been impossible for a chemical rocket. &quot;Dawn&quot;, the first NASA operational (i.e., non-technology demonstration) mission to use an ion drive for its primary propulsion, successfully orbited the large main-belt asteroids 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta. A more ambitious, nuclear-powered version was intended for a Jupiter mission without human crew, the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO), originally planned for launch sometime in the next decade. Due to a shift in priorities at NASA that favored human crewed space missions, the project lost funding in 2005. A similar mission is currently under discussion as the US component of a joint NASA/ESA program for the exploration of Europa and Ganymede.

A NASA multi-center Technology Applications Assessment Team led from the Johnson Spaceflight Center, has as of January 2011 described &quot;Nautilus-X&quot;, a concept study for a multi-mission space exploration vehicle useful for missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), of up to 24 months duration for a crew of up to six. Although Nautilus-X is adaptable to a variety of mission-specific propulsion units of various low-thrust, high specific impulse (Isp) designs, nuclear ion-electric drive is shown for illustrative purposes. It is intended for integration and checkout at the International Space Station (ISS), and would be suitable for deep-space missions from the ISS to and beyond the Moon, including Earth/Moon L1, Sun/Earth L2, near-Earth asteroidal, and Mars orbital destinations. It incorporates a reduced-g centrifuge providing artificial gravity for crew health to ameliorate the effects of long-term 0g exposure, and the capability to mitigate the space radiation environment.

====Fission powered rockets====
The electric propulsion missions already flown, or currently scheduled, have used solar electric power, limiting their capability to operate far from the Sun, and also limiting their peak acceleration due to the mass of the electric power source. Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, can reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles.

====Fusion rockets====
Fusion rockets, powered by nuclear fusion reactions, would &quot;burn&quot; such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, or 3He. Because fusion yields about 1% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases only about 0.1% of the fuel&#x27;s mass-energy. However, either fission or fusion technologies can in principle achieve velocities far higher than needed for Solar System exploration, and fusion energy still awaits practical demonstration on Earth.

One proposal using a fusion rocket was Project Daedalus. Another fairly detailed vehicle system, designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, &quot;Discovery II&quot;, based on the D3He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, has been described by a team from NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center. It achieves characteristic velocities of &gt;300 km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7•10−3 &quot;g&quot;, with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%.

Fusion rockets are considered to be a likely source of interplanetary transport for a planetary civilization.

====Exotic propulsion====
See the spacecraft propulsion article for a discussion of a number of other technologies that could, in the medium to longer term, be the basis of interplanetary missions. Unlike the situation with interstellar travel, the barriers to fast interplanetary travel involve engineering and economics rather than any basic physics.

===Solar sails===
Solar sails rely on the fact that light reflected from a surface exerts pressure on the surface. The radiation pressure is small and decreases by the square of the distance from the Sun, but unlike rockets, solar sails require no fuel. Although the thrust is small, it continues as long as the Sun shines and the sail is deployed.

The original concept relied only on radiation from the Sun – for example in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1965 story &quot;Sunjammer&quot;. More recent light sail designs propose to boost the thrust by aiming ground-based lasers or masers at the sail. Ground-based lasers or masers can also help a light-sail spacecraft to &quot;decelerate&quot;: the sail splits into an outer and inner section, the outer section is pushed forward and its shape is changed mechanically to focus reflected radiation on the inner portion, and the radiation focused on the inner section acts as a brake.

Although most articles about light sails focus on interstellar travel, there have been several proposals for their use within the Solar System.

Currently, the only spacecraft to use a solar sail as the main method of propulsion is IKAROS which was launched by JAXA on May 21, 2010. It has since been successfully deployed, and shown to be producing acceleration as expected. Many ordinary spacecraft and satellites also use solar collectors, temperature-control panels and Sun shades as light sails, to make minor corrections to their attitude and orbit without using fuel. A few have even had small purpose-built solar sails for this use (for example Eurostar E3000 geostationary communications satellites built by EADS Astrium).

===Cyclers===
It is possible to put stations or spacecraft on orbits that cycle between different planets, for example a Mars cycler would synchronously cycle between Mars and Earth, with very little propellant usage to maintain the trajectory. Cyclers are conceptually a good idea, because massive radiation shields, life support and other equipment only need to be put onto the cycler trajectory once. A cycler could combine several roles: habitat (for example it could spin to produce an &quot;artificial gravity&quot; effect), or a mothership (providing life support for the crews of smaller spacecraft which hitch a ride on it). Cyclers could also possibly make excellent cargo ships for resupply of a colony.

===Space elevator===

A space elevator is a theoretical structure that would transport material from a planet&#x27;s surface into orbit. The idea is that, once the expensive job of building the elevator is complete, an indefinite number of loads can be transported into orbit at minimal cost. Even the simplest designs avoid the vicious circle of rocket launches from the surface, wherein the fuel needed to travel the last 10% of the distance into orbit must be lifted all the way from the surface, requiring even more fuel, and so on. More sophisticated space elevator designs reduce the energy cost per trip by using counterweights, and the most ambitious schemes aim to balance loads going up and down and thus make the energy cost close to zero. Space elevators have also sometimes been referred to as &quot;beanstalks&quot;, &quot;space bridges&quot;, &quot;space lifts&quot;, &quot;space ladders&quot; and &quot;orbital towers&quot;.

A terrestrial space elevator is beyond our current technology, although a lunar space elevator could theoretically be built using existing materials.

===Skyhook===
A skyhook is a theoretical class of orbiting tether propulsion intended to lift payloads to high altitudes and speeds. Proposals for skyhooks include designs that employ tethers spinning at hypersonic speed for catching high speed payloads or high altitude aircraft and placing them in orbit. In addition, it has been suggested that the rotating skyhook is &quot;not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials&quot;.

===Launch vehicle and spacecraft reusability===
The SpaceX Starship is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable, making use of the SpaceX reusable technology that was developed during 2011–2018 for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk estimates that the reusability capability alone, on both the launch vehicle and the spacecraft associated with the Starship will reduce overall system costs per tonne delivered to Mars by at least two orders of magnitude over what NASA had previously achieved.

===Staging propellants===
When launching interplanetary probes from the surface of Earth, carrying all energy needed for the long-duration mission, payload quantities are necessarily extremely limited, due to the basis mass limitations described theoretically by the rocket equation. One alternative to transport more mass on interplanetary trajectories is to use up nearly all of the upper stage propellant on launch, and then refill propellants in Earth orbit before firing the rocket to escape velocity for a heliocentric trajectory. These propellants could be stored on orbit at a propellant depot, or carried to orbit in a propellant tanker to be directly transferred to the interplanetary spacecraft. For returning mass to Earth, a related option is to mine raw materials from a solar system celestial object, refine, process, and store the reaction products (propellant) on the Solar System body until such time as a vehicle needs to be loaded for launch.

====On-orbit tanker transfers====
As of 2019, SpaceX is developing a system in which a reusable first stage vehicle would transport a crewed interplanetary spacecraft to Earth orbit, detach, return to its launch pad where a tanker spacecraft would be mounted atop it, then both fueled, then launched again to rendezvous with the waiting crewed spacecraft. The tanker would then transfer its fuel to the human crewed spacecraft for use on its interplanetary voyage. The SpaceX Starship is a stainless steel-structure spacecraft propelled by six Raptor engines operating on densified methane/oxygen propellants. It is -long, -diameter at its widest point, and is capable of transporting up to of cargo and passengers per trip to Mars, with on-orbit propellant refill before the interplanetary part of the journey.

====Propellant plant on a celestial body====
As an example of a funded project currently under development, a key part of the system SpaceX has designed for Mars in order to radically decrease the cost of spaceflight to interplanetary destinations is the placement and operation of a physical plant on Mars to handle production and storage of the propellant components necessary to launch and fly the Starships back to Earth, or perhaps to increase the mass that can be transported onward to destinations in the outer Solar System.

The first Starship to Mars will carry a small propellant plant as a part of its cargo load. The plant will be expanded over multiple synods as more equipment arrives, is installed, and placed into mostly-autonomous production.

The SpaceX propellant plant will take advantage of the large supplies of carbon dioxide and water resources on Mars, mining the water (H2O) from subsurface ice and collecting CO2 from the atmosphere. A chemical plant will process the raw materials by means of electrolysis and the Sabatier process to produce oxygen (O2) and methane (CH4), and then liquefy it to facilitate long-term storage and ultimate use.

===Using extraterrestrial resources===
Current space vehicles attempt to launch with all their fuel (propellants and energy supplies) on board that they will need for their entire journey, and current space structures are lifted from the Earth&#x27;s surface. Non-terrestrial sources of energy and materials are mostly a lot further away, but most would not require lifting out of a strong gravity field and therefore should be much cheaper to use in space in the long term.

The most important non-terrestrial resource is energy, because it can be used to transform non-terrestrial materials into useful forms (some of which may also produce energy). At least two fundamental non-terrestrial energy sources have been proposed: solar-powered energy generation (unhampered by clouds), either directly by solar cells or indirectly by focusing solar radiation on boilers which produce steam to drive generators; and electrodynamic tethers which generate electricity from the powerful magnetic fields of some planets (Jupiter has a very powerful magnetic field).

Water ice would be very useful and is widespread on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn:
* The low gravity of these moons would make them a cheaper source of water for space stations and planetary bases than lifting it up from Earth&#x27;s surface.
* Non-terrestrial power supplies could be used to electrolyse water ice into oxygen and hydrogen for use in bipropellant rocket engines.
* Nuclear thermal rockets or Solar thermal rockets could use it as reaction mass. Hydrogen has also been proposed for use in these engines and would provide much greater specific impulse (thrust per kilogram of reaction mass), but it has been claimed that water will beat hydrogen in cost/performance terms despite its much lower specific impulse by orders of magnitude.
* A spacecraft with an adequate water supply could carry the water under the hull, which could provide a considerable additional safety margin for the vessel and its occupants:
** The water would absorb and conduct solar energy, thus acting as a heat shield. A vessel traveling in the inner Solar System could maintain a constant heading relative to the Sun without overheating the side of the spacecraft facing the Sun, provided the water under the hull was constantly circulated to evenly distribute the solar heat throughout the hull;
** The water would provide some additional protection against ionizing radiation;
** The water would act as an insulator against the extreme cold assuming it was kept heated, whether by the Sun when traveling in the inner Solar System or by an on board power source when traveling further away from the Sun;
** The water would provide some additional protection against micrometeoroid impacts, provided the hull was compartmentalized so as to ensure any leak could be isolated to a small section of the hull.

Oxygen is a common constituent of the Moon&#x27;s crust, and is probably abundant in most other bodies in the Solar System. Non-terrestrial oxygen would be valuable as a source of water ice only if an adequate source of hydrogen can be found. Possible uses include:

* In the life support systems of space ships, space stations and planetary bases.
* In rocket engines. Even if the other propellant has to be lifted from Earth, using non-terrestrial oxygen could reduce propellant launch costs by up to 2/3 for hydrocarbon fuel, or 85% for hydrogen. The savings are so high because oxygen accounts for the majority of the mass in most rocket propellant combinations.

Unfortunately hydrogen, along with other volatiles like carbon and nitrogen, are much less abundant than oxygen in the inner Solar System.

Scientists expect to find a vast range of organic compounds in some of the planets, moons and comets of the outer Solar System, and the range of possible uses is even wider. For example, methane can be used as a fuel (burned with non-terrestrial oxygen), or as a feedstock for petrochemical processes such as making plastics. And ammonia could be a valuable feedstock for producing fertilizers to be used in the vegetable gardens of orbital and planetary bases, reducing the need to lift food to them from Earth.

Even unprocessed rock may be useful as rocket propellant if mass drivers are employed.

==Design requirements for crewed interplanetary travel==

===Life support===
Life support systems must be capable of supporting human life for weeks, months or even years. A breathable atmosphere of at least must be maintained, with adequate amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, and controlled levels of carbon dioxide, trace gases and water vapor.

In October 2015, the NASA Office of Inspector General issued a health hazards report related to human spaceflight, including a human mission to Mars.
===Radiation===
Once a vehicle leaves low Earth orbit and the protection of Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, it enters the Van Allen radiation belt, a region of high radiation. Beyond the Van Allen belts, radiation levels generally decrease, but can fluctuate over time. These high energy cosmic rays pose a health threat. Even the minimum levels of radiation during these fluctuations is comparable to the current annual limit for astronauts in low-Earth orbit.

Scientists of Russian Academy of Sciences are searching for methods of reducing the risk of radiation-induced cancer in preparation for the mission to Mars. They consider as one of the options a life support system generating drinking water with low content of deuterium (a stable isotope of hydrogen) to be consumed by the crew members. Preliminary investigations have shown that deuterium-depleted water features certain anti-cancer effects. Hence, deuterium-free drinking water is considered to have the potential of lowering the risk of cancer caused by extreme radiation exposure of the Martian crew.

In addition, coronal mass ejections from the Sun are highly dangerous, and are fatal within a very short timescale to humans unless they are protected by massive shielding.

===Reliability===
Any major failure to a spacecraft en route is likely to be fatal, and even a minor one could have dangerous results if not repaired quickly, something difficult to accomplish in open space. The crew of the Apollo 13 mission survived despite an explosion caused by a faulty oxygen tank (1970).

===Launch windows===

For astrodynamics reasons, economic spacecraft travel to other planets is only practical within certain time windows. Outside these windows the planets are essentially inaccessible from Earth with current technology. This constrains flights and limits rescue options in the case of an emergency.

<text>In physics, interference is a phenomenon in which two coherent waves are combined by adding their intensities or displacements with due consideration for their phase difference. The resultant wave may have greater intensity (constructive interference) or lower amplitude (destructive interference) if the two waves are in phase or out of phase, respectively.
Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, for example, light, radio, acoustic, surface water waves, gravity waves, or matter waves as well as in loudspeakers as electrical waves.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;interference&quot; is derived from the Latin words &quot;inter&quot; which means &quot;between&quot; and &quot;fere&quot; which means &quot;hit or strike&quot;, and was used in the context of wave superposition by Thomas Young in 1801.

== Mechanisms ==


The principle of superposition of waves states that when two or more propagating waves of the same type are incident on the same point, the resultant amplitude at that point is equal to the vector sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves. If a crest of a wave meets a crest of another wave of the same frequency at the same point, then the amplitude is the sum of the individual amplitudes—this is constructive interference. If a crest of one wave meets a trough of another wave, then the amplitude is equal to the difference in the individual amplitudes—this is known as destructive interference. In ideal mediums (water, air are almost ideal) energy is always conserved, at points of destructive interference, the wave amplitudes cancel each other out, and the energy is redistributed to other areas. For example, when two pebbles are dropped in a pond, a pattern is observable; but eventually waves continue, and only when they reach the shore is the energy absorbed away from the medium.

Constructive interference occurs when the phase difference between the waves is an even multiple of (180°), whereas destructive interference occurs when the difference is an odd multiple of . If the difference between the phases is intermediate between these two extremes, then the magnitude of the displacement of the summed waves lies between the minimum and maximum values.

Consider, for example, what happens when two identical stones are dropped into a still pool of water at different locations. Each stone generates a circular wave propagating outwards from the point where the stone was dropped. When the two waves overlap, the net displacement at a particular point is the sum of the displacements of the individual waves. At some points, these will be in phase, and will produce a maximum displacement. In other places, the waves will be in anti-phase, and there will be no net displacement at these points. Thus, parts of the surface will be stationary—these are seen in the figure above and to the right as stationary blue-green lines radiating from the centre.

Interference of light is a unique phenomenon in that we can never observe superposition of the EM field directly as we can, for example, in water. Superposition in the EM field is an assumed phenomenon and necessary to explain how two light beams pass through each other and continue on their respective paths. Prime examples of light interference are the famous double-slit experiment, laser speckle, anti-reflective coatings and interferometers. 

In addition to classical wave model for understanding optical interference, quantum matter waves also demonstrate interference. 

=== Real-valued wave functions ===
The above can be demonstrated in one dimension by deriving the formula for the sum of two waves. The equation for the amplitude of a sinusoidal wave traveling to the right along the x-axis is
formula_1
where formula_2 is the peak amplitude, formula_3 is the wavenumber and formula_4 is the angular frequency of the wave. Suppose a second wave of the same frequency and amplitude but with a different phase is also traveling to the right
formula_5
where formula_6 is the phase difference between the waves in radians. The two waves will superpose and add: the sum of the two waves is
formula_7
Using the trigonometric identity for the sum of two cosines: formula_8 this can be written
formula_9
This represents a wave at the original frequency, traveling to the right like its components, whose amplitude is proportional to the cosine of formula_10.
* &quot;Constructive interference&quot;: If the phase difference is an even multiple of : formula_11 then formula_12, so the sum of the two waves is a wave with twice the amplitude formula_13
* &quot;Destructive interference&quot;: If the phase difference is an odd multiple of : formula_14 then formula_15, so the sum of the two waves is zero formula_16

=== Between two plane waves ===

A simple form of interference pattern is obtained if two plane waves of the same frequency intersect at an angle.
One wave is travelling horizontally, and the other is travelling downwards at an angle θ to the first wave. Assuming that the two waves are in phase at the point B, then the relative phase changes along the &quot;x&quot;-axis. The phase difference at the point A is given by

formula_17

It can be seen that the two waves are in phase when

formula_18

and are half a cycle out of phase when

formula_19

Constructive interference occurs when the waves are in phase, and destructive interference when they are half a cycle out of phase. Thus, an interference fringe pattern is produced, where the separation of the maxima is

formula_20

and is known as the fringe spacing. The fringe spacing increases with increase in wavelength, and with decreasing angle .

The fringes are observed wherever the two waves overlap and the fringe spacing is uniform throughout.

=== Between two spherical waves ===
A point source produces a spherical wave. If the light from two point sources overlaps, the interference pattern maps out the way in which the phase difference between the two waves varies in space. This depends on the wavelength and on the separation of the point sources. The figure to the right shows interference between two spherical waves. The wavelength increases from top to bottom, and the distance between the sources increases from left to right.

When the plane of observation is far enough away, the fringe pattern will be a series of almost straight lines, since the waves will then be almost planar.

=== Multiple beams ===
Interference occurs when several waves are added together provided that the phase differences between them remain constant over the observation time.

It is sometimes desirable for several waves of the same frequency and amplitude to sum to zero (that is, interfere destructively, cancel). This is the principle behind, for example, 3-phase power and the diffraction grating. In both of these cases, the result is achieved by uniform spacing of the phases.

It is easy to see that a set of waves will cancel if they have the same amplitude and their phases are spaced equally in angle. Using phasors, each wave can be represented as formula_21 for formula_22 waves from formula_23 to formula_24, where
formula_25

To show that
formula_26

one merely assumes the converse, then multiplies both sides by formula_27

The Fabry–Pérot interferometer uses interference between multiple reflections.

A diffraction grating can be considered to be a multiple-beam interferometer; since the peaks which it produces are generated by interference between the light transmitted by each of the elements in the grating; see interference vs. diffraction for further discussion.

== Complex valued wave functions ==
Mechanical and gravity waves can be directly observed: they are real-valued wave functions; optical and matter waves cannot be directly observed: they are complex valued wave functions. Some of the differences between real valued and complex valued wave interference include:

=== Optical wave interference ===
Because the frequency of light waves (~1014 Hz) is too high for currently available detectors to detect the variation of the electric field of the light, it is possible to observe only the intensity of an optical interference pattern. The intensity of the light at a given point is proportional to the square of the average amplitude of the wave. This can be expressed mathematically as follows. The displacement of the two waves at a point is:

formula_28
formula_29

where represents the magnitude of the displacement, represents the phase and represents the angular frequency.

The displacement of the summed waves is

formula_30

The intensity of the light at is given by

formula_31

This can be expressed in terms of the intensities of the individual waves as

formula_32

Thus, the interference pattern maps out the difference in phase between the two waves, with maxima occurring when the phase difference is a multiple of 2. If the two beams are of equal intensity, the maxima are four times as bright as the individual beams, and the minima have zero intensity.

Classically the two waves must have the same polarization to give rise to interference fringes since it is not possible for waves of different polarizations to cancel one another out or add together. Instead, when waves of different polarization are added together, they give rise to a wave of a different polarization state.

Quantum mechanically the theories of Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman offer a more modern approach. Dirac showed that every quanta or photon of light acts on its own which he famously stated as &quot;every photon interferes with itself&quot;. Richard Feynman showed that by evaluating a path integral where all possible paths are considered, that a number of higher probability paths will emerge. In thin films for example, film thickness which is not a multiple of light wavelength will not allow the quanta to traverse, only reflection is possible. 

==== Light source requirements ====
The discussion above assumes that the waves which interfere with one another are monochromatic, i.e. have a single frequency—this requires that they are infinite in time. This is not, however, either practical or necessary. Two identical waves of finite duration whose frequency is fixed over that period will give rise to an interference pattern while they overlap. Two identical waves which consist of a narrow spectrum of frequency waves of finite duration (but shorter than their coherence time), will give a series of fringe patterns of slightly differing spacings, and provided the spread of spacings is significantly less than the average fringe spacing, a fringe pattern will again be observed during the time when the two waves overlap.

Conventional light sources emit waves of differing frequencies and at different times from different points in the source. If the light is split into two waves and then re-combined, each individual light wave may generate an interference pattern with its other half, but the individual fringe patterns generated will have different phases and spacings, and normally no overall fringe pattern will be observable. However, single-element light sources, such as sodium- or mercury-vapor lamps have emission lines with quite narrow frequency spectra. When these are spatially and colour filtered, and then split into two waves, they can be superimposed to generate interference fringes. All interferometry prior to the invention of the laser was done using such sources and had a wide range of successful applications.

A laser beam generally approximates much more closely to a monochromatic source, and thus it is much more straightforward to generate interference fringes using a laser. The ease with which interference fringes can be observed with a laser beam can sometimes cause problems in that stray reflections may give spurious interference fringes which can result in errors.

Normally, a single laser beam is used in interferometry, though interference has been observed using two independent lasers whose frequencies were sufficiently matched to satisfy the phase requirements.
This has also been observed for widefield interference between two incoherent laser sources.

It is also possible to observe interference fringes using white light. A white light fringe pattern can be considered to be made up of a &#x27;spectrum&#x27; of fringe patterns each of slightly different spacing. If all the fringe patterns are in phase in the centre, then the fringes will increase in size as the wavelength decreases and the summed intensity will show three to four fringes of varying colour. Young describes this very elegantly in his discussion of two slit interference. Since white light fringes are obtained only when the two waves have travelled equal distances from the light source, they can be very useful in interferometry, as they allow the zero path difference fringe to be identified.

==== Optical arrangements ====
To generate interference fringes, light from the source has to be divided into two waves which then have to be re-combined. Traditionally, interferometers have been classified as either amplitude-division or wavefront-division systems.

In an amplitude-division system, a beam splitter is used to divide the light into two beams travelling in different directions, which are then superimposed to produce the interference pattern. The Michelson interferometer and the Mach–Zehnder interferometer are examples of amplitude-division systems.

In wavefront-division systems, the wave is divided in space—examples are Young&#x27;s double slit interferometer and Lloyd&#x27;s mirror.

Interference can also be seen in everyday phenomena such as iridescence and structural coloration. For example, the colours seen in a soap bubble arise from interference of light reflecting off the front and back surfaces of the thin soap film. Depending on the thickness of the film, different colours interfere constructively and destructively.

=== Quantum interference ===

Quantum interference – the observed wave-behavior of matter – resembles optical interference. Let formula_33 be a wavefunction solution of the Schrödinger equation for a quantum mechanical object. Then the probability formula_34 of observing the object at position formula_35 is formula_36 where * indicates complex conjugation. Quantum interference concerns the issue of this probability when the wavefunction is expressed as a sum or linear superposition of two terms formula_37:
formula_38

Usually, formula_39 and formula_40 correspond to distinct situations A and B. When this is the case, the equation formula_37 indicates that the object can be in situation A or situation B. The above equation can then be interpreted as: The probability of finding the object at formula_35 is the probability of finding the object at formula_35 when it is in situation A plus the probability of finding the object at formula_35 when it is in situation B plus an extra term. This extra term, which is called the &quot;quantum interference term&quot;, is formula_45 in the above equation. As in the classical wave case above, the quantum interference term can add (constructive interference) or subtract (destructive interference) from formula_46 in the above equation depending on whether the quantum interference term is positive or negative. If this term is absent for all formula_35, then there is no quantum mechanical interference associated with situations A and B.

The best known example of quantum interference is the double-slit experiment. In this experiment, matter waves from electrons, atoms or molecules approach a barrier with two slits in it. One slit becomes formula_39 and the other becomes formula_40. The interference pattern occurs on the far side, observed by detectors suitable to the particles originating the matter wave. The pattern matches the optical double slit pattern.

== Applications ==
===Beat===

In acoustics, a beat is an interference pattern between two sounds of slightly different frequencies, &quot;perceived&quot; as a periodic variation in volume whose rate is the difference of the two frequencies.

With tuning instruments that can produce sustained tones, beats can be readily recognized. Tuning two tones to a unison will present a peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating. The volume varies like in a tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively. As the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and may become so slow as to be imperceptible. As the two tones get further apart, their beat frequency starts to approach the range of human pitch perception, the beating starts to sound like a note, and a combination tone is produced. This combination tone can also be referred to as a missing fundamental, as the beat frequency of any two tones is equivalent to the frequency of their implied fundamental frequency.

=== Interferometry ===

Interferometry has played an important role in the advancement of physics, and also has a wide range of applications in physical and engineering measurement. The impact on physics and the applications span various types of waves.

==== Optical interferometry ====
Thomas Young&#x27;s double slit interferometer in 1803 demonstrated interference fringes when two small holes were illuminated by light from another small hole which was illuminated by sunlight. Young was able to estimate the wavelength of different colours in the spectrum from the spacing of the fringes. The experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light.
In quantum mechanics, this experiment is considered to demonstrate the inseparability of the wave and particle natures of light and other quantum particles (wave–particle duality). Richard Feynman was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment.

The results of the Michelson–Morley experiment are generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the theory of a luminiferous aether and in favor of special relativity.

Interferometry has been used in defining and calibrating length standards. When the metre was defined as the distance between two marks on a platinum-iridium bar, Michelson and Benoît used interferometry to measure the wavelength of the red cadmium line in the new standard, and also showed that it could be used as a length standard. Sixty years later, in 1960, the metre in the new SI system was defined to be equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum. This definition was replaced in 1983 by defining the metre as the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a specific time interval. Interferometry is still fundamental in establishing the calibration chain in length measurement.

Interferometry is used in the calibration of slip gauges (called gauge blocks in the US) and in coordinate-measuring machines. It is also used in the testing of optical components.

==== Radio interferometry ====

In 1946, a technique called astronomical interferometry was developed. Astronomical radio interferometers usually consist either of arrays of parabolic dishes or two-dimensional arrays of omni-directional antennas. All of the telescopes in the array are widely separated and are usually connected together using coaxial cable, waveguide, optical fiber, or other type of transmission line. Interferometry increases the total signal collected, but its primary purpose is to vastly increase the resolution through a process called Aperture synthesis. This technique works by superposing (interfering) the signal waves from the different telescopes on the principle that waves that coincide with the same phase will add to each other while two waves that have opposite phases will cancel each other out. This creates a combined telescope that is equivalent in resolution (though not in sensitivity) to a single antenna whose diameter is equal to the spacing of the antennas farthest apart in the array.

==== Acoustic interferometry ====
An acoustic interferometer is an instrument for measuring the physical characteristics of sound waves in a gas or liquid, such velocity, wavelength, absorption, or impedance. A vibrating crystal creates ultrasonic waves that are radiated into the medium. The waves strike a reflector placed parallel to the crystal, reflected back to the source and measured.

<doc id="15114" wikidata="Q763407" url="?curid=15114" title="Indictable offence">
<text>In many common law jurisdictions (e.g. England and Wales, Ireland, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore), an indictable offence is an offence which can only be tried on an indictment after a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is a &quot;prima facie&quot; case to answer or by a grand jury (in contrast to a summary offence). A similar concept in the United States is known as a felony, which for federal crimes, also requires an indictment. In Scotland, which is a hybrid common law jurisdiction, the procurator fiscal will commence solemn proceedings for serious crimes to be prosecuted on indictment before a jury.

==Australia==

In Australia, an indictable offence is more serious than a summary offence, and one where the defendant has the right to trial by jury. They include crimes such as murder, rape, and threatening or endangering life. The system is underpinned by various state and territory acts and the &quot;Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914&quot;.

In South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland, indictable offences are further split into two categories: major indictable offences (including murder, rape, and threatening or endangering life) are heard in the state&#x27;s Supreme Court, while minor indictable offences are heard in the District Court. In South Australia, minor indictable offences are generally heard in magistrates courts, although the defendant may elect to be heard in the District Court.
==Canada==

In Canada, an indictable offence is a crime that is more serious than a summary offence. Examples of indictable offences include theft over $5,000, breaking and entering, aggravated sexual assault, and murder. Maximum penalties for indictable offences are different depending on the crime and can include life in prison. There are minimum penalties for some indictable offences.

==England and Wales==
In relation to England and Wales, the expression &quot;indictable offence&quot; means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable on indictment, whether it is exclusively so triable or triable either way; and the term &quot;indictable&quot;, in its application to offences, is to be construed accordingly. In this definition, references to the way or ways in which an offence is triable are to be construed without regard to the effect, if any, of section 22 of the Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1980 on the mode of trial in a particular case.

An either-way offence allows the defendant to elect between trial by jury on indictment in the Crown Court and summary trial in a magistrates&#x27; court. However, the election may be overruled by the magistrates&#x27; court if the facts suggest that the sentencing powers of a magistrates&#x27; court would be inadequate to reflect the seriousness of the offence. 

In relation to some indictable offences, for example criminal damage, only summary trial is available unless the damage caused exceeds £5,000. 

A youth court has jurisdiction to try all indictable offences with the exception of homicide and certain firearms offences, and will normally do so provided that the available sentencing power of two years&#x27; detention is adequate to punish the offender if found guilty.

===History===
See section 64 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. 

Grand juries were abolished in 1933.

===Offences triable only on indictment===
Some offences such as murder and rape are considered so serious that they can only be tried on indictment at the Crown Court where the widest range of sentencing powers is available to the judge.

The expression &quot;indictable-only offence&quot; was defined by section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, as originally enacted, as an offence triable only on indictment. Sections 51 and 52 of, and Schedule 3 to, that Act abolished committal proceedings for such offences and made other provisions in relation to them.

When the accused is charged with an indictable-only offence, he or she will be tried in the Crown Court. The rules are different in England and Wales in respect of those under 18 years of age.

See also section 14(a) of the Criminal Law Act 1977.

==New Zealand==
Similarly in New Zealand, a rape or murder charge will be tried at the High Court, while less serious offences such as theft will be tried at the District Court. However, the District Court can hold both jury and summary trials.

==United States==
In the United States, federal felonies always require an indictment from a grand jury before proceeding to trial. In contrast, while misdemeanors may proceed to trial on indictment, this is not required, as they may also proceed on information or complaint. Different states have different policies; since the requirement of an indictment by grand jury is not incorporated against the states, in many states, an indictment is not required for a felony case to proceed. However, some states do still use grand jury indictments for felony-level offenses and may use other terminology. For instance, in New Jersey, whose constitution requires all &quot;crimes&quot; to be charged by indictment but allows lesser &quot;offenses&quot; not to be, felony-level offenses are commonly called &quot;indictable offenses&quot;, including in the New Jersey Penal Code, to avoid confusion between the narrow technical definition of the word &quot;crime&quot; from the state&#x27;s constitutional jurisprudence and the broader sense.

<doc id="15116" wikidata="Q631" url="?curid=15116" title="Inter Milan">
<text>Football Club Internazionale Milano, commonly referred to as Internazionale () or simply Inter, and colloquially known as Inter Milan in English-speaking countries, is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Inter is the only Italian side to have always competed in the top flight of Italian football since its debut in 1909.

Founded in 1908 following a schism within the Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club (now AC Milan), Inter won its first championship in 1910. Since its formation, the club has won 37 domestic trophies, including 20 league titles, nine Coppa Italia, and eight Supercoppa Italiana. From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record at that time. They have won the European Cup/Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965, and then another in 2010. Their latest win completed an unprecedented Italian seasonal treble, with Inter winning the Coppa Italia and the &quot;Scudetto&quot; the same year. The club has also won three UEFA Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.

Inter&#x27;s home games are played at the San Siro stadium, which they share with city rivals AC Milan. The stadium is the largest in Italian football with a capacity of 75,817. They have long-standing rivalries with Milan, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, and Juventus, with whom they contest the Derby d&#x27;Italia; their rivalry with the former is one of the most followed derbies in football. Inter has the highest home game attendance in Italy and the fourth-highest attendance in Europe. Since May 2024, the club has been owned by American asset management company Oaktree Capital Management. Inter is one of the most valuable clubs in Italian and world football.

==History==
===Foundation and early years (1908–1960)===


The club was founded on 9 March 1908 as &quot;Football Club Internazionale&quot;, when a group of players left the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now AC Milan) to form a new club because they wanted to accept more foreign players. The name of the club derives from the wish of its founding members to accept foreign players as well as Italians. The club won its first championship in 1910 and its second in 1920. The captain and coach of the first championship winning team was Virgilio Fossati, who was later killed in battle while serving in the Italian army during World War I.

In 1922, Inter was at risk of relegation to the second division, but they remained in the top league after winning two play-offs.

Six years later, during the Fascist era, the club merged with the &quot;Unione Sportiva Milanese&quot; and, for political reasons, was renamed &quot;Società Sportiva Ambrosiana&quot;. During the 1928–29 season, the team wore white jerseys with a red cross emblazoned on it; the jersey&#x27;s design was inspired by the flag and coat of arms of the city of Milan. In 1929, the new club chairman Oreste Simonotti changed the club&#x27;s name to &quot;Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana&quot; and restored the previous black-and-blue jerseys; however, supporters continued to call the team &quot;Inter&quot;, and in 1931 new chairman Pozzani succumbed to shareholder pressure and changed the name to &quot;Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana-Inter&quot;.

Inter won its third and fourth Serie A title in 1930 and 1938, and also their first Coppa Italia (Italian Cup) was won in 1939, led by Giuseppe Meazza one of the greatest Italian player of all time and the greatest scorer in Inter history with 284 goals, and after whom the San Siro stadium is officially named. A fifth championship followed in 1940, that ended a decade dominated by three teams: Inter, Bologna and the historic rival Juventus.

In the 30&#x27;s Inter also played for seven times in one of the first major European football cups, the Central European Cup, with Meazza that was a record three times topscorer of the competition; coached by Hungarian Árpád Weisz Inter reached the final of the competition in 1933, when after had won the first leg in Milan 2–1, lost 3–1 in 9 men against Austria Vienna. 
4 out of 11 players of that team: Meazza, Luigi Allemandi, Attilio Demaría and Armando Castellazzi would go on to win the 1934 World Cup with Italian national team, while other four Inter players will contribute to the win of 1938 World Cup with Italy: Meazza, Ugo Locatelli, Giovanni Ferrari and Pietro Ferraris.

After the end of World War II, the club&#x27;s name changed back to its original one, Internazionale, and it come close to win Serie A title in two occasions, one in the last season of Grande Torino in 1949 and in 1951 with the contribution of great players acquired by president Carlo Masseroni in these years, like the first Dutch player in club history Faas Wilkes; Inter will win its sixth championship in 1953 and its seventh in 1954, for the first time in two consecutive years, coached by Alfredo Foni and led by two of the most prolific strikers in club history: István Nyers and Benito Lorenzi with Lennart Skoglund that completed the offensive trio.

In May 1955 Angelo Moratti became the new owner of Inter and despite a disappointment start in the first years with different coaches and players, he put foundations to one of the greatest team in football history.

===&quot;Grande Inter&quot; (1960–1967)===
In 1960, manager Helenio Herrera joined Inter from Barcelona, bringing with him Spanish midfielder Luis Suárez in 1961, who won the European Footballer of the Year in the same year for his role in Barcelona&#x27;s La Liga/Fairs Cup double. He would transform Inter into one of the leading teams in Europe that would win three Serie A titles in four years, two European Cup and two Intercontinental Cup in a row. He modified a 5–3–2 tactic known as the &quot;Verrou&quot; (&quot;door bolt&quot;), which created greater flexibility for counterattacks. The &quot;catenaccio&quot; system was invented by an Austrian coach, Karl Rappan. Rappan&#x27;s original system was implemented with four fixed defenders, playing a strict man-to-man marking system, plus a playmaker in the middle of the field, who plays the ball together with two midfield wings. Herrera would modify it by adding a fifth defender, the sweeper or libero, behind the two centre backs. The sweeper or &quot;libero&quot;, who acted as the free man, would deal with any attackers who went through the two centre backs. Inter finished third in the Serie A in his first season, second the next year and first in his third season. Then followed a back-to-back European Cup victory in 1964 and 1965, earning him the title &quot;il Mago&quot; (&quot;the Wizard&quot;). The core of Herrera&#x27;s team were the attacking full-backs Tarcisio Burgnich and Giacinto Facchetti, Armando Picchi the sweeper, Suárez the playmaker, Jair the winger, Mario Corso the left midfielder and Sandro Mazzola, who played on the inside-right.

After the Serie A title won in previous season, in 1964 Inter reached the European Cup Final by beating Borussia Dortmund in the semi-final and Partizan in the quarter-final. In the final in Praterstadion, Vienna they met Real Madrid, a team that had reached seven out of the nine finals to date. Mazzola scored two goals and one from Milani in a 3–1 victory, becoming also the first ever team to win the tournament without losing a single game. 
The team also won the Intercontinental Cup after have lost the first match in Argentine against Independiente 1–0, Inter won second leg 2–0 in San Siro with goals from Mazzola and Corso, in the third decisive match played in Santiago Bernabeu Inter won in extra-time with a goal from Mario Corso, the first Italian club to win the trophy.

In 1964 Inter added other important players Angelo Domenghini, Gianfranco Bedin and another Spanish Joaquín Peiró that played with constance and was decisive in European Cup where three foreign players could play in the same time while in Serie A only two were allowed to play.

A year later, after have defeated Liverpool F.C. in the semi-final second leg 3–0 recovering from a 3–1 defeat at Anfield with Facchetti scoring the decisive goal, Inter repeated the feat by beating two-time winner Benfica in the final held at home, from a Jair goal, and then again beat Independiente in the Intercontinental Cup with a 3–0 win in San Siro, with two goals from Mazzola and one from Peirò, and a draw in Argentine, becoming the first European team to win two times in a row the competition. Inter came close to winning the Treble for the first time in European football history that year, after having also won the Serie A title, but lost the Coppa Italia final against Juventus in a game played in the last days of August 1965.

Inter again reached semifinals of the European cup in 1966, but this time lost against a Real Madrid team that would go on to win the tournament, while in national championship Herrera&#x27;s squad won the tenth scudetto in club history, the first Star.

At the end of the season Moratti signed two of the greatest players of all time: Franz Beckenbauer and Eusebio, but after 1966 World Cup when Italian National Team was eliminated by North Korea, Italian Federation decided to block new signings of foreign players who will last until 1980, avoided the contract with the two players.

In 1967, after Inter eliminated Real Madrid in quarterfinals, with Suárez injured, Inter lost the European Cup Final in Lisbon 2–1 to Celtic; a week later, despite the first position, with a lost against Mantova in the last match of the championship Inter lost also the Serie A title and a week later the Coppa Italia semifinal against Padova, putting an end de facto to the Grande Inter cicle with the first season without trophy since 1961–1962. During that year, the club changed its name to &quot;Football Club Internazionale Milano&quot;, and in 1968 after 13 years Angelo Moratti sold the team to Ivanoe Fraizzoli, and also Helenio Herrera left the team.

===Subsequent achievements (1967–1991)===
Following the golden era of the 1960s, Inter managed to win their eleventh league title in 1971 with Roberto Boninsegna that leaded the league with 24 goals, and their twelfth in 1980. Inter were defeated for the second time in five years in the final of the European Cup, losing 0–2 to Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Ajax in 1972. During the 1970s and the 1980s, Inter also added two to its Coppa Italia tally, in 1977–78 and 1981–82 under coach Eugenio Bersellini.

Italian federation reopened the possibility to sign foreign players in 1980, Inter signed among others Hansi Müller (1975–1982 VfB Stuttgart, 1982–1984 Inter), Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (1974–1984 Bayern Munich, 1984–1987 Inter) and Argentinian Daniel Passarella (1986–1988 Inter); other important players in that time were Italians Graziano Bini, Walter Zenga, Giuseppe Bergomi, Alessandro Altobelli, Gabriele Oriali, Riccardo Ferri, Gianpiero Marini and Giuseppe Baresi: Bergomi, Oriali, Marini and Altobelli were part of Italy squad that won 1982 FIFA World Cup.

In 1981 Inter reached for the sixth time in six participations European Cup Semifinals this time against Real Madrid, a classic match that will repeat in 3 different European competitions in the 80&#x27;s: in UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarter-finals in 1983 and in Uefa Cup semi-finals in 1985 and 1986.

Led by the German duo of Andreas Brehme and Lothar Matthäus, with Aldo Serena top scorer in Serie A with 22 goals, Argentine Ramón Díaz and Nicola Berti, Inter coached by Giovanni Trapattoni captured the 1989 Serie A championship ended with an all-time record for most points in Serie A history with 18 teams, with 58 points out of 68. Inter were unable to defend their title in the following season in a very competitive Serie A, despite adding fellow German Jürgen Klinsmann to the squad and winning their first Supercoppa Italiana at the start of the season.

===Mixed fortunes (1991–2004)===
The 1990s was a lackluster period. While their great rivals Milan and Juventus were achieving success both domestically and in Europe, Inter enjoyed little success in the domestic league standings, their worst coming in 1993–94 when they finished just one point out of the relegation zone. Nevertheless, they achieved some European success, with three UEFA Cup victories, in 1991, 1994 and 1998.

After the win of the 1990 World Cup of West Germany led by three Inter players, Matthews was awarded of Ballon d&#x27;Or and ended 1990–1991, his most prolific season in career, with 23 goals including 6 in 1991 UEFA Cup won against Roma in May 1991, the first European trophy since the Grande Inter period.

In 1992, after a disappointing season, in sostitution of the three German players that left in the summer and with the new coach Osvaldo Bagnoli, Inter signed important players like the future Ballon d&#x27;Or Matthias Sammer, Rubén Sosa, the first Russian player in club history Igor Shalimov and others that will delude like Darko Pancev and Salvatore Schillaci; Inter ended the season second behind AC Milan coached by Fabio Capello.

In the following season Inter acquired from Ajax Wim Jonk and Dennis Bergkamp that, with 8 goals in the competition, led Inter to their second victory in UEFA Cup despite the worst result in club history in Serie A.

With Massimo Moratti&#x27;s takeover from Ernesto Pellegrini in 1995, Inter twice broke the world record transfer fee in this period (£19.5 million for Ronaldo from Barcelona in 1997 and £31 million for Christian Vieri from Lazio two years later).
Among Moratti first acquisitions in 1995 there were Javier Zanetti from Banfield, that will stay at Inter until 2014 with a record of 858 game played and with a record 13 season as a captain, Paul Ince from Manchester United and Roberto Carlos from Palmeiras that will be sold the next season to Real Madrid with many regrets and recriminations from fans.

However, the 1990s remained the only decade in Inter&#x27;s history, alongside the 1940s, in which they did not win a single Serie A championship. This persistent lack of success led to poor relations between the fanbase and the chairman, the managers, and even some individual players.

Moratti later became a target of the fans, especially when he sacked the much-loved coach Luigi Simoni after a few games into the 1998–99 season, five days after Inter have defeated Real Madrid 3–1 at San Siro in Champions League group stage with two goals from Roberto Baggio, and having just received the Italian manager of the year award for 1998 the day before being dismissed.
That season despite 4 coaches changes Inter reached Champions League quarter Finals when it will be eliminated from Manchester United that would go on to win the trophy that year; Inter failed to qualify for any European competition for the first time in seven years, finishing in eighth place.

In the previous seasons in 1996–1997 Inter reached for third time Uefa Cup final losing this time at penalty in Giuseppe Meazza against Schalke 04 with Roy Hodgson that resigned shortly afterwards, instead in 1997–1998 under Simoni Inter had won his third UEFA Cup defending in Paris final Lazio 3–0 with goals from Ivan Zamorano, Zanetti and Ronaldo, and nearly won Serie A title, with many controversial referee decisions culminated in the decisive match against Juventus in Turin with Inter behind only 1 point with 4 games left, when referee didn&#x27;t concede a penalty on Ronaldo and after few seconds conceded a penalty for Juventus, that generated a turmoil on the pitch and a big scandal, with president Moratti that left the building shortly afterwards.

The following season, 1999–2000, Moratti appointed former Juventus manager Marcello Lippi, and signed players such as Angelo Peruzzi, Laurent Blanc and Clarence Seedorf from Real Madrid, together with other former Juventus players Vieri and Vladimir Jugović and sold important players like Diego Simeone, Youri Djorkaeff and Gianluca Pagliuca. The team came close to their first domestic success since 1989 when they reached the Coppa Italia final, only to be defeated by Lazio, in a match remembered for the second severe injury to the right knee of Ronaldo, who was returning after five months of inactivity, and which would keep him out for more than a year and a half.

Inter&#x27;s misfortunes continued the following season, losing the 2000 Supercoppa Italiana match against Lazio 4–3, after initially taking the lead through new signing Robbie Keane. They were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the Champions League by Swedish club Helsingborg, with Álvaro Recoba missing a crucial late penalty. Lippi was sacked after only a single game of the new season following Inter&#x27;s first ever Serie A defeat to Reggina. Marco Tardelli, chosen to replace Lippi, failed to improve results, and is remembered by Inter fans as the manager who lost 6–0 in the city derby against Milan.

In 2002 with new coach Hector Cuper, the acquisition of the second most expensive goalkeeper in the world at that time Francesco Toldo and the return after injury of Ronaldo in pair with Vieri, not only did Inter manage to make it to the UEFA Cup semi-finals, but were also only 45 minutes away from capturing the &quot;Scudetto&quot; when they needed to maintain their one-goal advantage away to Lazio. Inter were 2–1 up after only 24 minutes. Lazio equalised during first half injury time, and then scored two more goals by Simeone and Simone Inzaghi in the second half to secure victory that saw Juventus win the championship, Roma ended second and Inter third. After brilliant performances and have won 2002 World Cup with Brazil, Ronaldo demanded and ottened to be sold to Real Madrid for €45 million, and was replaced by Hernan Crespo from Lazio for €40 million, Seedorf was sold to AC Milan and Fabio Cannavaro was acquired from Parma.

The next season Inter finished as league runners-up with Vieri that was top scorer of Serie A with 24 goals in 23 matches, while Crespo set a new record for UCL Group stage with 8 goals in 6 matches but missed almost the rest of the season for a severe injury in January. In October 2002 in a home game against Lyon Inter was defeated for the first time in its history at home in European Cup/UEFA Champions League after 33 matches in 39 years. Inter reached 2002–03 Champions League semi-finals against AC Milan, that were played also without Vieri out for injury, losing on the away goals rule with two draw in the same stadium in San Siro.

2003–2004 season started well with an historic win for Inter and for Italian football in Champions League in Highbury against Arsenal of Invincibles with a 3–0 and a win against Dinamo Kyiv, but after a draw against Brescia in Serie A in October coach Cuper was sacked and was replaced by Alberto Zaccheroni that will end up eliminated from Champions League in group stage, and despite acquisition in January of strong players like Dejan Stankovic and Adriano, Inter will finish only 4th. Other members of the Inter &quot;family&quot; during this period who suffered were the likes of Vieri and Cannavaro, both of whom had their restaurants in Milan vandalised after the second defeats of the season to the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; 3–2 in February 2004 in Serie A, but most important was the resignation from presidency by Massimo Moratti in favour of Giacinto Facchetti in January 2004, that lasted until the premature death of Inter legend in September 2006.

===Comeback and unprecedented treble (2004–2011)===
On 8 July 2004, Inter appointed former Lazio manager Roberto Mancini as its new head coach, with players who will make the history of Inter like Esteban Cambiasso, Julio Cesar, and in 2005 Walter Samuel and Luis Figo. In his first season, the team collected 72 points from 18 wins, 18 draws and only two losses, as well as winning the Coppa Italia against Roma with two goal from Adriano and later the Supercoppa Italiana in Turin against Juventus with a goal from Juan Sebastián Verón. On 11 May 2006, Inter won the Coppa Italia title for the second season in a row after defeating Roma with a 4–1 aggregate victory (a 1–1 scoreline in Rome and a 3–1 win at the San Siro).

Inter were awarded the 2005–06 Serie A championship retrospectively, after title-winning Juventus was relegated and points were stripped from Milan due to the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal. During the following season, Inter with new players like Maicon, Maxwell, Patrick Vieira, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the return of Crespo from Chelsea, went on a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in Serie A, starting on 25 September 2006, with a 4–1 home victory over Livorno, and ending on 28 February 2007, after a 1–1 draw at home to Udinese. On 22 April 2007, Inter won their second consecutive &quot;Scudetto&quot;—and first on the field since 1989—when they defeated Siena 2–1 at Stadio Artemio Franchi, ended the season with an all time Serie A record of 97 points and an all-time record margin of 22 points over second place Roma. Italian World Cup-winning defender Marco Materazzi scored both goals.

In this period Inter also reached two times UCL quarter-finals in 2005 and 2006, and UCL round of 16 in 2007: in the last two occasions Inter was eliminated from away goals rules by Villareal and Valencia.

Inter started the 2007–08 season with the goal of winning both Serie A and Champions League in the year of centenary from the foundation of the club. The team started well in the league, topping the table from the first round of matches, and also managed to qualify for the Champions League knockout stage. However, a late collapse, leading to a 2–0 defeat with ten men away to Liverpool on 19 February in the Champions League, brought manager Roberto Mancini&#x27;s future at Inter, into question while domestic form took a sharp turn of fortune, with the team failing to win in the three following Serie A games. After being eliminated by Liverpool in the Champions League, Mancini announced his intention to leave his job immediately only to change his mind the following day. On the final day of the 2007–08 Serie A season, Inter played Parma away, that had to win to not be relegated in Serie B after 18 years; Roma scored in Catania and was in the first place until Zlatan Ibrahimović, 10 minutes after have been entered on the pitch in the second half, scored two goals sealed their third consecutive championship. Mancini, however, was sacked soon after, due to his previous announcement to leave the club.

On 2 June 2008, Inter appointed former Porto and Chelsea boss José Mourinho as new head coach. In his first season, the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; won a Suppercoppa Italiana and a fourth consecutive title, though falling in the Champions League in the first knockout round for a third-straight year, losing to eventual finalist Manchester United. In winning the league title, Inter became the first club in since 1949 to win the title for four consecutive seasons, and joined Torino and Juventus as the only clubs to accomplish this feat, as well as being the first club based outside Turin.

In the summer of 2009 Inter put foundation to maybe the greatest single season of its history: after have signed Diego Milito and Thiago Motta from Genoa, Lúcio from Bayern Munich, the club agreed to sell Ibrahimovic to Barcelona in change for Samuel Eto&#x27;o plus 49 millions euros.
The transfer session ended with the sign of Wesley Sneijder from Real Madrid in the last days of August.
Inter won the 2009–10 Champions League, defeating in round of 16 Ancelotti&#x27;s Chelsea, Cska Moscow and reigning champions Barcelona in the semi-final, before beating Bayern Munich 2–0 in the final in Madrid, with two goals from Diego Milito. Inter also won the 2009–10 Serie A title by two points over Roma, the fifth consecutive, and the 2010 Coppa Italia by defeating the same side 1–0 in the final. This made Inter the first and only Italian team to win the treble. At the end of the season, Mourinho left the club to manage Real Madrid; he was replaced by Rafael Benítez.

On 21 August 2010, Inter defeated Roma 3–1 and won the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana, their fourth trophy of the year. In December 2010, they claimed the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time after a 3–0 win against Mazembe in the final. However, after this win, on 23 December 2010, due to their declining performance in Serie A, the club fired Benítez. He was replaced by Leonardo the following day.

Leonardo started with 30 points from 12 games, with an average of 2.5 points per game, better than his predecessors Benítez and Mourinho. On 6 March 2011, Leonardo set a new Italian Serie A record by collecting 33 points in 13 games; the previous record was 32 points in 13 games, made by Fabio Capello in the 2004–05 season. Leonardo led the club to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, after have defeated again Bayern Munich in Round of 16, before losing to Schalke 04; Inter ended second in Serie A and won the Coppa Italia title. At the end of the season, however, he resigned, and was followed by new managers Gian Piero Gasperini, Claudio Ranieri and Andrea Stramaccioni, all hired during the following season.

===Changes in ownership (2011–2019)===
On 1 August 2012, the club announced that Moratti was to sell a minority stake of the club to a Chinese consortium led by Kenneth Huang. On the same day, Inter announced an agreement was formed with China Railway Construction Corporation Limited for a new stadium project, however, the deal with the Chinese eventually collapsed. The 2012–13 season was the worst in recent club history, with Inter finishing ninth in Serie A and failing to qualify for any European competitions. Walter Mazzarri was appointed to replace Stramaccioni as the manager for 2013–14 season on 24 May 2013, having ended his tenure at Napoli. He guided the club to fifth in Serie A and to 2014–15 UEFA Europa League qualification.

On 15 October 2013, an Indonesian consortium (International Sports Capital HK Ltd.) led by Erick Thohir, Handy Soetedjo and Rosan Roeslani, signed an agreement to acquire 70% of Inter shares from Internazionale Holding S.r.l. Immediately after the deal, Moratti&#x27;s Internazionale Holding S.r.l. still retained 29.5% of the shares of FC Internazionale Milano S.p.A. After the deal, the shares of Inter was owned by a chain of holding companies, namely International Sports Capital S.p.A. of Italy (for 70% stake), International Sports Capital HK Limited and Asian Sports Ventures HK Limited of Hong Kong. Asian Sports Ventures HK Limited, itself another intermediate holding company, was owned by Nusantara Sports Ventures HK Limited (60% stake, a company owned by Thohir), Alke Sports Investment HK Limited (20% stake) and Aksis Sports Capital HK Limited (20% stake).

Thohir, who also co-owned Major League Soccer (MLS) club D.C. United and Indonesia Super League (ISL) club Persib Bandung, announced on 2 December 2013 that Inter and D.C. United had formed a strategic partnership. During the Thohir era the club began to modify its financial structure from one reliant on continual owner investment to a more self-sustainable business model, although the club still breached UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in 2015. The club was fined and received a squad reduction in UEFA competitions, with additional penalties suspended during the probation period. During this time, Roberto Mancini returned as the club manager on 14 November 2014, with Inter finishing eighth. Inter finished 2015–2016 season fourth, failing to return to Champions League.

On 6 June 2016, Suning Holdings Group (via a Luxembourg-based subsidiary Great Horizon S.á r.l.) a company owned by Zhang Jindong, co-founder and chairman of Suning Commerce Group, acquired a majority stake of Inter from Thohir&#x27;s consortium International Sports Capital S.p.A. and from Moratti family&#x27;s remaining shares in Internazionale Holding S.r.l. According to various filings, the total investment from Suning was €270 million. The deal was approved by an extraordinary general meeting on 28 June 2016, from which Suning Holdings Group had acquired a 68.55% stake in the club.

The first season of new ownership, however, started with poor performance in pre-season friendlies. On 8 August 2016, Inter parted company with head coach Roberto Mancini by mutual consent over disagreements regarding the club&#x27;s direction, especially with new signings Joao Mario for 44,75 million € (the second most expensive player in club history at that time) and Gabigol for 29,5 million €. He was replaced by Frank de Boer, who was sacked on 1 November 2016 after leading Inter to a 4W–2D–5L record in 11 Serie A games as head coach. The successor, Stefano Pioli, could not prevent the team from getting the worst group result in UEFA competitions in the club&#x27;s history. Despite an eight-game winning streak, he and the club parted away before season&#x27;s end, when it became clear they would finish outside the league&#x27;s top three for the sixth consecutive season. On 9 June 2017, former Roma coach Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Inter manager, signing a two-year contract, and eleven months later Inter secured a UEFA Champions League group stage spot after going six years without Champions League participation, thanks to a 3–2 victory against Lazio in the final game of 2017–18 Serie A. Due to this success, in August the club extended the contract with Spalletti to 2021.

On 26 October 2018, Steven Zhang was appointed as new president of the club, and on 13 December 2018 
Giuseppe Marotta officially joined Inter Milan as CEO for sport. On 25 January 2019, the club officially announced that LionRock Capital from Hong Kong had reached an agreement with International Sports Capital HK Limited, in order to acquire its 31.05% shares in Inter and to become the club&#x27;s new minority shareholder.
After the 2018–19 Serie A season, despite Inter finishing fourth, Spalletti was sacked.

===Renewed successes (2019–present)===
On 31 May 2019, Inter appointed former Juventus and Italian manager Antonio Conte as their new coach, signing a three-year deal; 
In the summer of 2019 Inter acquired from Manchester United for 74 million € Romelu Lukaku, the new most expensive player in the history of the club, Nicolò Barella for 44,5 million € from Cagliari and sold Mauro Icardi, one of the best striker in Italy in the past years, to PSG for 50 million €.

In September 2019, Steven Zhang was elected to the board of the European Club Association. In the 2019–20 Serie A, Inter Milan finished as runner-up, as they won 2–0 against Atalanta on the last matchday. They also reached the 2020 UEFA Europa League final, ultimately losing 3–2 to Sevilla. 
Inter improved team with signigns of new players, among others in January 2020 Christian Eriksen from Tottenham for 27 million € and in July Achraf Hakimi from Borussia Dortmund for 43 million €.

Despite the worst group result in Champions League in the club&#x27;s history, following Atalanta&#x27;s draw against Sassuolo on 2 May 2021, Internazionale were confirmed as champions for the first time in eleven years, ending Juventus&#x27;s run of nine consecutive titles. However, despite securing Serie A glory, Conte left the club by mutual consent on 26 May 2021. The departure was reportedly due to disagreements between Conte and the board over player transfers. In June 2021, Simone Inzaghi was appointed as Conte&#x27;s replacement. On 6 July 2021 Achraf Hakimi was sold to Paris Saint Germain for €60 million and on 8 August 2021, Romelu Lukaku was sold to Chelsea for €115 million, representing the most expensive association football transfer by an Italian football club ever.

Inter qualified in the UCL Round of 16 for the first time in ten years, but despite the club&#x27;s first ever win at Anfield Road thanks to a goal from Lautaro Martinez, they were eliminated by Liverpool.
On 12 January 2022, Inter won the Supercoppa Italiana, defeating Juventus 2–1 at San Siro. After conceding a goal to the opponent, Inter equalised with a penalty scored by Lautaro Martínez, and the match finished 1–1 in regulation time. In the last second of the extra-time, Alexis Sánchez scored the winning goal following a defensive error, giving Inter the first trophy of the season, also Simone Inzaghi&#x27;s first trophy as Inter manager. On 11 May 2022, Inter won the Coppa Italia, defeating Juventus 4–2 at Stadio Olimpico. After normal time had ended 2–2, with Nicolò Barella and Hakan Çalhanoğlu scoring Inter&#x27;s goals, Ivan Perišić&#x27;s brace in the extra-time gave Inter the win and a second title of the season. The 2021–22 Serie A campaign saw Inter finish in second place, being the most prolific attacking side with 84 goals. On 18 January 2023, Inter won the Supercoppa Italiana, defeating Milan 3−0 at King Fahd International Stadium, thanks to goals from Federico Dimarco, Edin Džeko, and Lautaro Martinez.

Inter passed again UCL group stage after have eliminated Barcelona, and then after have defeated Porto and Benfica, qualified for semifinals of the competition.
On 16 May 2023, Inter defeated archrivals Milan in the semi-finals of 2022–23 UEFA Champions League with goals from Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the first leg and a goal from Martinez in the second leg, advanced to the Champions League final for the first time since 2010. However, they were defeated at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium 1−0 by Manchester City after a second half goal from midfielder Rodri.

In January 2024 Inter won its eight Supercoppa Italiana and its third consecutive, in a new format with 4 teams, tying the record set by AC Milan in 90&#x27;s for consecutive win, after have defeated in Riad Lazio 3–0 and then in the final match Napoli 1–0, with a late goal by Lautaro Martinez.

In July 2023 Inter sold for 50 million € goalkeeper Andre Onana to Manchester United, acquired the prior season for free, like Hakan Calhanoglu in 2021, Henrikh Mkhitaryan in 2022 and Marcus Thuram in 2023.

On 22 April 2024, Inter secured their 20th Serie A title and the second Star by defeating Milan 2–1 at the San Siro in a record sixth consecutive Derby della Madonnina win in a dominant season ended with 94 points, 19 over Milan second, the best attack with 89 goals made and the best defense with only 22 goals conceded with +67 difference, the best in Serie A since 1950–1951 season.

On 22 May 2024, Oaktree Capital Management assumed ownership of Inter Milan following the default of Suning Holdings Group on a substantial loan given in May 2021 to the club in order to cover losses incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. The firm took control of the club after Suning Holdings Group failed to repay a debt of €395 million ($428 million). This development was confirmed by Oaktree in an emailed statement. As a consequence, the new ownership chose to appoint CEO Giuseppe Marotta as the club&#x27;s new chairman.

==Colours and badge==

One of the founders of Inter, a painter named Giorgio Muggiani, was responsible for the design of the first Inter logo in 1908. The first design incorporated the letters &quot;FCIM&quot; in the centre of a series of circles that formed the badge of the club. The basic elements of the design have remained constant even as finer details have been modified over the years. Starting from the 1999–2000 season, the original club crest was reduced in size, to create space for the addition of the club&#x27;s name and foundation year at the upper and lower part of the logo respectively.

In 2007, the logo was returned to the pre-1999–2000 era. It was given a more modern look with a smaller &quot;Scudetto&quot; star and lighter colour scheme. This version was used until July 2014, when the club decided to undertake a rebranding. The most significant difference between the current and the previous logo is the omission of the star from other media except match kits.

Since its founding in 1908, Inter have almost always worn black and blue stripes, earning them the nickname &quot;Nerazzurri&quot;. According to the tradition, the colours were adopted to represent the nocturnal sky: in fact, the club was established on the night of 9 March, at 23:30; moreover, blue was chosen by Giorgio Muggiani because he considered it to be the opposite colour to red, worn by the Milan Cricket and Football Club rivals.

During the 1928–29 season, however, Inter were forced by Fascist regime to abandon their black and blue uniforms. In 1928, Inter&#x27;s name and philosophy made the ruling Fascist Party uneasy; as a result, during the same year the 20-year-old club was merged with &quot;Unione Sportiva Milanese&quot;: the new club was named &quot;Società Sportiva Ambrosiana&quot; after the patron saint of Milan. The flag of Milan (the red cross on white background) replaced the traditional black and blue. In 1929, the black-and-blue jerseys were restored, and after World War II, when the Fascists had fallen from power, the club reverted to their original name. In 2008, Inter celebrated their centenary with a red cross on their away shirt. The cross is reminiscent of the flag of their city, and they continue to use the pattern on their third kit. In 2014, the club adopted a predominantly black home kit with thin blue pinstripes before returning to a more traditional design the following season.

Animals are often used to represent football clubs in Italy – the grass snake, called &quot;Biscione&quot;, represents Inter. The snake is a symbol for the city of Milan, appearing often in Milanese heraldry as a coiled viper with a man in its jaws. The symbol is present on the coat of arms of the House of Sforza (which ruled over Italy from Milan during the Renaissance period), the city of Milan, the historical Duchy of Milan (a 400-year state of the Holy Roman Empire) and Insubria (a historical region the city of Milan falls within). For the 2010–11 season, Inter&#x27;s away kit featured the snake.

==Stadium==


The team&#x27;s stadium is the 75,923 seat San Siro, officially known as the &quot;Stadio Giuseppe Meazza&quot; after the former player who represented for 14 seasons Inter and for two Milan. The more commonly used name, &quot;San Siro&quot;, is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan&#x27;s chairman at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Inter, when they were accepted as joint tenant.

The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Inter beat Milan 6–3 in a friendly match. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations. A major structural renovation was made for the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final while another one took place in late 2021 to host the UEFA Nations League final. The stadium is going to be refurbished again in time for Milano Cortina 2026.

Based on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its atmosphere during matches, owing to the closeness of the stands to the pitch.

===New Milano Stadium===
Since 2012, various proposals and projects by Massimo Moratti have alternated regarding a possible construction of a new Inter stadium.
 Between June and July 2019, Inter and Milan announced the agreement for the construction of a new shared stadium in the San Siro area. In the winter of 2021, Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, gave official permission for the construction of the new stadium next to San Siro, which is expected to be partially demolished and refunctionalised after the 2026 Olympic Games. In early 2022, Inter and Milan revealed a &quot;plan B&quot; to relocate the construction of the new Milano stadium in the Greater Milan, away from the San Siro area.

==Supporters and rivalries==

Inter is the second most supported club in Italy, according to an August 2024 research by &quot;Ipsos&quot;. In the early years (until the First World War), Inter fans from the city of Milan were typically middle class, while Milan fans were typically working class. During Massimo Moratti&#x27;s ownership, Inter fans were considered to be on the moderate left. At the same time, during Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s reign, Milan fans were viewed as belonging to the centre-right.

The traditional ultras group of Inter is &quot;Boys San&quot;; which are one of the oldest Italian ultras groups, being founded in 1969. Politically, one group (Irriducibili) of Inter Ultras are right-wing and this group has relations with the Lazio ultras. As well as the main group (apolitical) of &quot;Boys San&quot;, there are five more significant groups: &quot;Viking&quot; (apolitical), &quot;Irriducibili&quot; (right-wing), &quot;Ultras&quot; (apolitical), &quot;Brianza Alcoolica&quot; (apolitical) and &quot;Imbastisci&quot; (left-wing).

Inter&#x27;s most vocal fans gather in the Curva Nord, or north curve of the San Siro. This longstanding tradition has led to the Curva Nord being synonymous with the club&#x27;s most die-hard supporters, who unfurl banners and wave flags in support of their team. Throughout 2024, the Curva Nord (labelled as the &quot;Curva Nord Milano&quot;) have collaborated with rap duo ¥$ (composed of Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign) on multiple occasions, appearing as a choir on the chart-topping hit song &quot;Carnival&quot; (alongside rapping on its chorus) featuring Playboi Carti and Rich the Kid and on the ¥$ remix of &quot;Like That&quot; featuring only Future and record producer Metro Boomin (Kendrick Lamar would not appear on the remixed version of the song).

Inter have several rivalries, two of which are highly significant in Italian football; firstly, they participate in the intracity &quot;Derby della Madonnina&quot; with Milan; the rivalry has existed ever since Inter splintered off from Milan in 1908. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary atop the Milan Cathedral. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the match. Flares are commonly present, but they also led to the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final matchup between Milan and Inter on 12 April, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan keeper Dida on the shoulder.

The other principal rivalry is with Juventus; matches between the two clubs are known as the &quot;Derby d&#x27;Italia&quot;. Up until the 2006 Italian football scandal, which saw Juventus relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs never to have played below Serie A. In the 2000s, Inter developed a rivalry with Roma, who finished as runners-up to Inter in all but one of Inter&#x27;s five &quot;Scudetto&quot;-winning seasons between 2005–06 and 2009–10. The two sides have also contested in five Coppa Italia finals and four Supercoppa Italiana finals since 2006. Other clubs, like Atalanta and Napoli, are also considered among their rivals. Their supporters collectively go by &quot;Interisti&quot;, or &quot;Nerazzurri.&quot;

== Honours ==

Inter have won 37 domestic trophies, including the Serie A twenty times, the Coppa Italia nine times and the Supercoppa Italiana eight times. From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record before 2017, when Juventus won their sixth successive league title. They have won the UEFA Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965 and then another in 2010; the last completed an unprecedented Italian treble with the Coppa Italia and the &quot;Scudetto&quot;. The club has also won three UEFA Europa League, two Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup.

Inter has never been relegated from the top flight of Italian football in its entire existence. It is the sole club to have competed in Serie A and its predecessors in every season since its debut in 1909.

==Club statistics and records==

Javier Zanetti holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Inter, with 858 official games played in total and 618 in Serie A.

Giuseppe Meazza is Inter&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer, with 284 goals in 408 games. Behind him, in second place, is Alessandro Altobelli with 209 goals in 466 games, and Roberto Boninsegna in third place, with 171 goals over 281 games.

Helenio Herrera had the longest reign as Inter coach, with nine years (eight consecutive) in charge, and is the most successful coach in Inter history with three &quot;Scudetti&quot;, two European Cups, and two Intercontinental Cup wins. José Mourinho, who was appointed on 2 June 2008, completed his first season in Italy by winning the Serie A title and the Supercoppa Italiana; in his second season he won the first &quot;treble&quot; in Italian history: the Serie A, Coppa Italia and the UEFA Champions League.

==Corporate==
FC Internazionale Milano S.p.A. was heavily dependent on the financial contribution from the owner Massimo Moratti. In June 2006, the shirt sponsor and the minority shareholder of the club, Pirelli, sold 15.26% shares of the club to Moratti family, for €13.5 million. The tyre manufacturer retained 4.2%. However, due to several capital increases of Inter, such as a reversed merger with an intermediate holding company, Inter Capital S.r.l. in 2006, which held 89% shares of Inter and €70 million capitals at that time, or issues new shares for €70.8 million in June 2007, €99.9 million in December 2007, €86.6 million in 2008, €70 million in 2009, €40 million in 2010 and 2011, €35 million in 2012 or allowing Thoir subscribed €75 million new shares of Inter in 2013, Pirelli became the third largest shareholders of just 0.5%, . Inter had yet another recapitalization that was reserved for Suning Holdings Group in 2016. In the prospectus of Pirelli&#x27;s second IPO in 2017, the company also revealed that the value of the remaining shares of Inter that was owned by Pirelli, was write-off to zero in 2016 financial year. Inter also received direct capital contribution from the shareholders to cover loss which was excluded from issuing shares in the past. ()

Right before the takeover of Thohir, the consolidated balance sheets of &quot;Internazionale Holding S.r.l.&quot; showed the whole companies group had a bank debt of €157 million, including the bank debt of a subsidiary &quot;Inter Brand Srl&quot;, as well as the club itself, to Istituto per il Credito Sportivo (ICS), for €15.674 million on the balance sheet at the end of the 2012–13 financial year. In 2006, Inter sold its brand to the new subsidiary, &quot;Inter Brand S.r.l.&quot;, a special purpose entity with a shares capital of €40 million, for €158 million (the deal made Internazionale make a net loss of just €31 million in a separate financial statement). At the same time, the subsidiary secured a €120 million loan from Banca Antonveneta, which would be repaid in installments until 30 June 2016; &quot;La Repubblica&quot; described the deal as &quot;doping&quot;. In September 2011, Inter secured a loan from ICS by factoring the sponsorship of Pirelli of 2012–13 and 2013–14 season, for €24.8 million, in an interest rate of 3 months Euribor + 1.95% spread. In June 2014, new Inter Group secured €230 million loan from Goldman Sachs and UniCredit at a new interest rate of 3 months Euribor + 5.5% spread, as well as setting up a new subsidiary to be the debt carrier: &quot;Inter Media and Communication S.r.l.&quot;. €200 million of which would be utilized in debt refinancing of the group. The €230million loan, €1 million (plus interests) would be due on 30 June 2015, €45 million (plus interests) would be repaid in 15 installments from 30 September 2015 to 31 March 2019, as well as €184 million (plus interests) would be due on 30 June 2019. In ownership side, the Hong Kong-based International Sports Capital HK Limited, had pledged the shares of Italy-based International Sports Capital S.p.A. (the direct holding company of Inter) to CPPIB Credit Investments for €170 million in 2015, at an interest rate of 8% p.a (due March 2018) to 15% p.a. (due March 2020). ISC repaid the notes on 1 July 2016 after they sold part of the shares of Inter to Suning Holdings Group. However, in the late 2016 the shares of ISC S.p.A. was pledged again by ISC HK to private equity funds of OCP Asia for US$80 million. In December 2017, the club also refinanced its debt of €300 million, by issuing corporate bond to the market, via Goldman Sachs as the bookkeeper, for an interest rate of 4.875% p.a.

Considering revenue alone, Inter surpassed city rivals in Deloitte Football Money League for the first time, in the 2008–2009 season, to rank in ninth place, one place behind Juventus in eighth place, with Milan in tenth place. In the 2009–10 season, Inter remained in ninth place, surpassing Juventus (10th) but Milan re-took the leading role as the seventh. Inter became the eighth in 2010–2011, but was still one place behind Milan. Since 2011, Inter fell to 11th in 2011–12, 15th in 2012–13, 17th in 2013–14, 19th in 2014–15 and 2015–16 season. In 2016–17 season, Inter was ranked 15th in the &quot;Money League&quot;.

In 2010 &quot;Football Money League&quot; (2008–09 season), the normalized revenue of €196.5 million were divided up between matchday (14%, €28.2 million), broadcasting (59%, €115.7 million, +7%, +€8 million) and commercial (27%, €52.6 million, +43%). Kit sponsors Nike and Pirelli contributed €18.1 million and €9.3 million respectively to commercial revenues, while broadcasting revenues were boosted €1.6 million (6%) by Champions League distribution. Deloitte expressed the idea that issues in Italian football, particularly matchday revenue issues, were holding Inter back compared to other big European clubs, and developing their own stadia would result in Serie A clubs being more competitive on the world stage.

In the 2009–10 season, the revenue of Inter was boosted by the sales of Ibrahimović, the treble and the release clause of coach José Mourinho. According to the normalized figures by Deloitte in their 2011 &quot;Football Money League&quot;, in the 2009–10 season, the revenue had increased €28.3 million (14%) to €224.8 million. The ratio of matchday, broadcasting and commercial in the adjusted figures was 17%:62%:21%.

For the 2010–11 season, Serie A clubs started negotiating club TV rights collectively rather than individually. This was predicted to result in lower broadcasting revenues for big clubs such as Juventus and Inter, with smaller clubs gaining from the loss. Eventually the result included an extraordinary income of €13 million from RAI. In 2012 &quot;Football Money League&quot; (2010–11 season), the normalized revenue was €211.4 million. The ratio of matchday, broadcasting and commercial in the adjusted figures was 16%:58%:26%.

However, combining revenue and cost, in the 2006–07 season they had a net loss of €206 million (€112 million extraordinary basis, due to the abolition of non-standard accounting practice of the special amortization fund), followed by a net loss of €148 million in the 2007–08 season, a net loss of €154 million in 2008–09 season, a net loss of €69 million in the 2009–10 season, a net loss of €87 million in the 2010–11 season, a net loss of €77 million in the 2011–12 season, a net loss of €80 million in the 2012–13 season and a net profit of €33 million in 2013–14 season, due to special income from the establishment of subsidiary Inter Media and Communication. All aforementioned figures were in separate financial statement. Figures from consolidated financial statement were announced since the 2014–15 season, which were net losses of €140.4 million (2014–15), €59.6 million (2015–16 season, before 2017 restatement) and €24.6 million (2016–17).

In 2015, Inter and Roma were the only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by the UEFA due to their breaking of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations, which was followed by AC Milan which was once barred from returning to European competition in 2018. As a probation to avoid further sanction, Inter agreed to have a three-year aggregate break-even from 2015 to 2018, with the 2015–16 season being allowed to have a net loss of a maximum of €30 million, followed by break-even in the 2016–17 season and onwards. Inter was also fined €6 million plus an additional €14 million in probation.

Inter also made a financial trick in the transfer market in mid-2015, in which Stevan Jovetić and Miranda were signed by Inter on temporary deals plus an obligation to sign outright in 2017, making their cost less in the loan period. Moreover, despite heavily investing in new signings, namely Geoffrey Kondogbia and Ivan Perišić, signings which potentially increased the cost in amortization, Inter also sold Mateo Kovačić for €29 million, making a windfall profit. In November 2018, documents from Football Leaks further revealed that the loan signings such as Xherdan Shaqiri in January 2015, was in fact had inevitable conditions to trigger the outright purchase.

On 21 April 2017, Inter announced that their net loss (FFP adjusted) of the 2015–16 season was within the allowable limit of €30 million. However, on the same day, UEFA also announced that the reduction of squad size of Inter in European competitions would not be lifted yet, due to partial fulfilment of the targets in the settlement agreement. The same announcement was made by UEFA in June 2018, based on Inter&#x27;s 2016–17 season financial result.

In February 2020, Inter Milan sued Major League Soccer (MLS) for trademark infringement, claiming that the term &quot;Inter&quot; is synonymous with its club and no one else.

On May 22, 2024, US-based investment firm Oaktree Capital Management said it “assumed ownership” of the club, after previous owner, Suning, a Chinese holding company, missed the deadline on a €395 million debt payment taken out during the COVID pandemic. Oaktree had previously guaranteed Suning&#x27;s loan in 2021 with Suning&#x27;s ownership stake in the club as collateral. As a result, Suning&#x27;s default on the loan resulted in Oaktree&#x27;s right to take control of the organization.

<text>Interferons (IFNs, ) are a group of signaling proteins made and released by host cells in response to the presence of several viruses. In a typical scenario, a virus-infected cell will release interferons causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defenses.

IFNs belong to the large class of proteins known as cytokines, molecules used for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system that help eradicate pathogens. Interferons are named for their ability to &quot;interfere&quot; with viral replication by protecting cells from virus infections. However, virus-encoded genetic elements have the ability to antagonize the IFN response, contributing to viral pathogenesis and viral diseases. IFNs also have various other functions: they activate immune cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, and they increase host defenses by up-regulating antigen presentation by virtue of increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. Certain symptoms of infections, such as fever, muscle pain and &quot;flu-like symptoms&quot;, are also caused by the production of IFNs and other cytokines.

More than twenty distinct IFN genes and proteins have been identified in animals, including humans. They are typically divided among three classes: Type I IFN, Type II IFN, and Type III IFN. IFNs belonging to all three classes are important for fighting viral infections and for the regulation of the immune system.

==Types of interferon==
Based on the type of receptor through which they signal, human interferons have been classified into three major types.
* Interferon type I: All type I IFNs bind to a specific cell surface receptor complex known as the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) that consists of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains. The type I interferons present in humans are IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ε, IFN-κ and IFN-ω. Interferon beta (IFN-β) can be produced by all nucleated cells when they recognize that a virus has invaded them. The most prolific producers of IFN-α and IFN-β are plasmacytoid dendritic cells circulating in the blood. Monocytes and macrophages can also produce large amounts of type I interferons when stimulated by viral molecular patterns. The production of type I IFN-α is inhibited by another cytokine known as Interleukin-10. Once released, type I interferons bind to the IFN-α/β receptor on target cells, which leads to expression of proteins that will prevent the virus from producing and replicating its RNA and DNA. Overall, IFN-α can be used to treat hepatitis B and C infections, while IFN-β can be used to treat multiple sclerosis.
* Interferon type II (IFN-γ in humans): This is also known as immune interferon and is activated by Interleukin-12. Type II interferons are also released by cytotoxic T cells and type-1 T helper cells. However, they block the proliferation of type-2 T helper cells. The previous results in an inhibition of Th2 immune response and a further induction of Th1 immune response. IFN type II binds to IFNGR, which consists of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 chains.
* Interferon type III: Signal through a receptor complex consisting of IL10R2 (also called CRF2-4) and IFNLR1 (also called CRF2-12). Although discovered more recently than type I and type II IFNs, recent information demonstrates the importance of Type III IFNs in some types of virus or fungal infections.

In general, type I and II interferons are responsible for regulating and activating the immune response. Expression of type I and III IFNs can be induced in virtually all cell types upon recognition of viral components, especially nucleic acids, by cytoplasmic and endosomal receptors, whereas type II interferon is induced by cytokines such as IL-12, and its expression is restricted to immune cells such as T cells and NK cells.

== Function ==
All interferons share several common effects: they are antiviral agents and they modulate functions of the immune system. Administration of Type I IFN has been shown experimentally to inhibit tumor growth in animals, but the beneficial action in human tumors has not been widely documented.
A virus-infected cell releases viral particles that can infect nearby cells. However, the infected cell can protect neighboring cells against a potential infection of the virus by releasing interferons. In response to interferon, cells produce large amounts of an enzyme known as protein kinase R (PKR). This enzyme phosphorylates a protein known as eIF-2 in response to new viral infections; the phosphorylated eIF-2 forms an inactive complex with another protein, called eIF2B, to reduce protein synthesis within the cell. Another cellular enzyme, RNAse L—also induced by interferon action—destroys RNA within the cells to further reduce protein synthesis of both viral and host genes. Inhibited protein synthesis impairs both virus replication and infected host cells. In addition, interferons induce production of hundreds of other proteins—known collectively as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)—that have roles in combating viruses and other actions produced by interferon.
They also limit viral spread by increasing p53 activity, which kills virus-infected cells by promoting apoptosis. The effect of IFN on p53 is also linked to its protective role against certain cancers.

Another function of interferons is to up-regulate major histocompatibility complex molecules, MHC I and MHC II, and increase immunoproteasome activity. All interferons significantly enhance the presentation of MHC I dependent antigens. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) also significantly stimulates the MHC II-dependent presentation of antigens. Higher MHC I expression increases presentation of viral and abnormal peptides from cancer cells to cytotoxic T cells, while the immunoproteasome processes these peptides for loading onto the MHC I molecule, thereby increasing the recognition and killing of infected or malignant cells. Higher MHC II expression increases presentation of these peptides to helper T cells; these cells release cytokines (such as more interferons and interleukins, among others) that signal to and co-ordinate the activity of other immune cells.

Interferons can also suppress angiogenesis by down regulation of angiogenic stimuli deriving from tumor cells. They also suppress the proliferation of endothelial cells. Such suppression causes a decrease in tumor angiogenesis, a decrease in its vascularization and subsequent growth inhibition. Interferons, such as interferon gamma, directly activate other immune cells, such as macrophages and natural killer cells.

==Induction of interferons==
Production of interferons occurs mainly in response to microbes, such as viruses and bacteria, and their products. Binding of molecules uniquely found in microbes—viral glycoproteins, viral RNA, bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), bacterial flagella, CpG motifs—by pattern recognition receptors, such as membrane bound toll like receptors or the cytoplasmic receptors RIG-I or MDA5, can trigger release of IFNs.
Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) is important for inducing interferons in response to the presence of double-stranded RNA viruses; the ligand for this receptor is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). After binding dsRNA, this receptor activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which are important for initiating synthesis of many inflammatory proteins. RNA interference technology tools such as siRNA or vector-based reagents can either silence or stimulate interferon pathways. Release of IFN from cells (specifically IFN-γ in lymphoid cells) is also induced by mitogens. Other cytokines, such as interleukin 1, interleukin 2, interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor and colony-stimulating factor, can also enhance interferon production.

==Downstream signaling==
By interacting with their specific receptors, IFNs activate &quot;signal transducer and activator of transcription&quot; (STAT) complexes; STATs are a family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of certain immune system genes. Some STATs are activated by both type I and type II IFNs. However each IFN type can also activate unique STATs.

STAT activation initiates the most well-defined cell signaling pathway for all IFNs, the classical Janus kinase-STAT (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway. In this pathway, JAKs associate with IFN receptors and, following receptor engagement with IFN, phosphorylate both STAT1 and STAT2. As a result, an IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex forms—this contains STAT1, STAT2 and a third transcription factor called IRF9—and moves into the cell nucleus. Inside the nucleus, the ISGF3 complex binds to specific nucleotide sequences called &quot;IFN-stimulated response elements&quot; (ISREs) in the promoters of certain genes, known as IFN stimulated genes ISGs. Binding of ISGF3 and other transcriptional complexes activated by IFN signaling to these specific regulatory elements induces transcription of those genes. A collection of known ISGs is available on Interferome, a curated online database of ISGs (www.interferome.org); Additionally, STAT homodimers or heterodimers form from different combinations of STAT-1, -3, -4, -5, or -6 during IFN signaling; these dimers initiate gene transcription by binding to IFN-activated site (GAS) elements in gene promoters. Type I IFNs can induce expression of genes with either ISRE or GAS elements, but gene induction by type II IFN can occur only in the presence of a GAS element.

In addition to the JAK-STAT pathway, IFNs can activate several other signaling cascades. For instance, both type I and type II IFNs activate a member of the CRK family of adaptor proteins called CRKL, a nuclear adaptor for STAT5 that also regulates signaling through the C3G/Rap1 pathway. Type I IFNs further activate &quot;p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase&quot; (MAP kinase) to induce gene transcription. Antiviral and antiproliferative effects specific to type I IFNs result from p38 MAP kinase signaling. The &quot;phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase&quot; (PI3K) signaling pathway is also regulated by both type I and type II IFNs. PI3K activates P70-S6 Kinase 1, an enzyme that increases protein synthesis and cell proliferation; phosphorylates ribosomal protein s6, which is involved in protein synthesis; and phosphorylates a translational repressor protein called &quot;eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1&quot; (EIF4EBP1) in order to deactivate it.

Interferons can disrupt signaling by other stimuli. For example, interferon alpha induces RIG-G, which disrupts the CSN5-containing COP9 signalosome (CSN), a highly conserved multiprotein complex implicated in protein deneddylation, deubiquitination, and phosphorylation. RIG-G has shown the capacity to inhibit NF-κB and STAT3 signaling in lung cancer cells, which demonstrates the potential of type I IFNs.

==Viral resistance to interferons==
Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to resist interferon activity. They circumvent the IFN response by blocking downstream signaling events that occur after the cytokine binds to its receptor, by preventing further IFN production, and by inhibiting the functions of proteins that are induced by IFN. Viruses that inhibit IFN signaling include Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2), and viruses of the herpesvirus family, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8). Viral proteins proven to affect IFN signaling include EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) from Epstein-Barr virus, the large T antigen of Polyomavirus, the E7 protein of Human papillomavirus (HPV), and the B18R protein of vaccinia virus. Reducing IFN-α activity may prevent signaling via STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 (as with JEV infection) or through the JAK-STAT pathway (as with DEN-2 infection). Several poxviruses encode soluble IFN receptor homologs—like the B18R protein of the vaccinia virus—that bind to and prevent IFN interacting with its cellular receptor, impeding communication between this cytokine and its target cells. Some viruses can encode proteins that bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to prevent the activity of RNA-dependent protein kinases; this is the mechanism reovirus adopts using its sigma 3 (σ3) protein, and vaccinia virus employs using the gene product of its E3L gene, p25. The ability of interferon to induce protein production from interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) can also be affected. Production of protein kinase R, for example, can be disrupted in cells infected with JEV. Some viruses escape the anti-viral activities of interferons by gene (and thus protein) mutation. The H5N1 influenza virus, also known as bird flu, has resistance to interferon and other anti-viral cytokines that is attributed to a single amino acid change in its Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1), although the precise mechanism of how this confers immunity is unclear. The relative resistance of hepatitis C virus genotype I to interferon-based therapy has been attributed in part to homology between viral envelope protein E2 and host protein kinase R, a mediator of interferon-induced suppression of viral protein translation, although mechanisms of acquired and intrinsic resistance to interferon therapy in HCV are polyfactorial.

==Coronavirus response==
Coronaviruses evade innate immunity during the first ten days of viral infection. In the early stages of infection, SARS-CoV-2 induces an even lower interferon type I (IFN-I) response than SARS-CoV, which itself is a weak IFN-I inducer in human cells. SARS-CoV-2 limits the IFN-III response as well. Reduced numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells with age is associated with increased COVID-19 severity, possibly because these cells are substantial interferon producers.

Ten percent of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 have autoantibodies against type I interferon.

Delayed IFN-I response contributes to the pathogenic inflammation (cytokine storm) seen in later stages of COVID-19 disease. Application of IFN-I prior to (or in the very early stages of) viral infection can be protective, which should be validated in randomized clinical trials.

With pegylated IFN lambda, the relative risk for hospitalization with the Omicron strains is reduced by about 80 %.

==Interferon therapy==
===Diseases===

Interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b are used to treat and control multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disorder. This treatment may help in reducing attacks in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and slowing disease progression and activity in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.

Interferon therapy is used (in combination with chemotherapy and radiation) as a treatment for some cancers. This treatment can be used in hematological malignancy, such as in leukemia and lymphomas including hairy cell leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, nodular lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Patients with recurrent melanomas receive recombinant IFN-α2b.

Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C can be treated with IFN-α, often in combination with other antiviral drugs. Some of those treated with interferon have a sustained virological response and can eliminate hepatitis virus in the case of hepatitis C. The most common strain of hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide—genotype I— can be treated with interferon-α, ribavirin and protease inhibitors such as telaprevir, boceprevir or the nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir. Biopsies of patients given the treatment show reductions in liver damage and cirrhosis. Control of chronic hepatitis C by IFN is associated with reduced hepatocellular carcinoma. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding the type III interferon IFN-λ3 was found to be protective against chronic infection following proven HCV infection and predicted treatment response to interferon-based regimens. The frequency of the SNP differed significantly by race, partly explaining observed differences in response to interferon therapy between European-Americans and African-Americans.

Unconfirmed results suggested that interferon eye drops may be an effective treatment for people who have herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis, a type of eye infection. There is no clear evidence to suggest that removing the infected tissue (debridement) followed by interferon drops is an effective treatment approach for these types of eye infections. Unconfirmed results suggested that the combination of interferon and an antiviral agent may speed the healing process compared to antiviral therapy alone.

When used in systemic therapy, IFNs are mostly administered by an intramuscular injection. The injection of IFNs in the muscle or under the skin is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are flu-like symptoms: increased body temperature, feeling ill, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, convulsion, dizziness, hair thinning, and depression. Erythema, pain, and hardness at the site of injection are also frequently observed. IFN therapy causes immunosuppression, in particular through neutropenia and can result in some infections manifesting in unusual ways.

===Drug formulations===

Several different types of interferons are approved for use in humans. One was first approved for medical use in 1986. For example, in January 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of PEGylated interferon-alpha in the USA; in this formulation, PEGylated interferon-alpha-2b (&quot;Pegintron&quot;), polyethylene glycol is linked to the interferon molecule to make the interferon last longer in the body. Approval for PEGylated interferon-alpha-2a (&quot;Pegasys&quot;) followed in October 2002. These PEGylated drugs are injected once weekly, rather than administering two or three times per week, as is necessary for conventional interferon-alpha. When used with the antiviral drug ribavirin, PEGylated interferon is effective in treatment of hepatitis C; at least 75% of people with hepatitis C genotypes 2 or 3 benefit from interferon treatment, although this is effective in less than 50% of people infected with genotype 1 (the more common form of hepatitis C virus in both the U.S. and Western Europe). Interferon-containing regimens may also include protease inhibitors such as boceprevir and telaprevir.

There are also interferon-inducing drugs, notably tilorone that is shown to be effective against Ebola virus.

==History==

Interferons were first described in 1957 by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann at the National Institute for Medical Research in London; the discovery was a result of their studies of viral interference. Viral interference refers to the inhibition of virus growth caused by previous exposure of cells to an active or a heat-inactivated virus. Isaacs and Lindenmann were working with a system that involved the inhibition of the growth of live influenza virus in chicken embryo chorioallantoic membranes by heat-inactivated influenza virus. Their experiments revealed that this interference was mediated by a protein released by cells in the heat-inactivated influenza virus-treated membranes. They published their results in 1957 naming the antiviral factor they had discovered &quot;interferon&quot;. The findings of Isaacs and Lindenmann have been widely confirmed and corroborated in the literature.

Furthermore, others may have made observations on interferons before the 1957 publication of Isaacs and Lindenmann. For example, during research to produce a more efficient vaccine for smallpox, Yasu-ichi Nagano and Yasuhiko Kojima—two Japanese virologists working at the Institute for Infectious Diseases at the University of Tokyo—noticed inhibition of viral growth in an area of rabbit-skin or testis previously inoculated with UV-inactivated virus. They hypothesised that some &quot;viral inhibitory factor&quot; was present in the tissues infected with virus and attempted to isolate and characterize this factor from tissue homogenates. Independently, Monto Ho, in John Enders&#x27;s lab, observed in 1957 that attenuated poliovirus conferred a species specific anti-viral effect in human amniotic cell cultures. They described these observations in a 1959 publication, naming the responsible factor &quot;viral inhibitory factor&quot; (VIF). It took another fifteen to twenty years, using somatic cell genetics, to show that the interferon action gene and interferon gene reside in different human chromosomes. The purification of human beta interferon did not occur until 1977. Y.H. Tan and his co-workers purified and produced biologically active, radio-labeled human beta interferon by superinducing the interferon gene in fibroblast cells, and they showed its active site contains tyrosine residues. Tan&#x27;s laboratory isolated sufficient amounts of human beta interferon to perform the first amino acid, sugar composition and N-terminal analyses. They showed that human beta interferon was an unusually hydrophobic glycoprotein. This explained the large loss of interferon activity when preparations were transferred from test tube to test tube or from vessel to vessel during purification. The analyses showed the reality of interferon activity by chemical verification. The purification of human alpha interferon was not reported until 1978. A series of publications from the laboratories of Sidney Pestka and Alan Waldman between 1978 and 1981, describe the purification of the type I interferons IFN-α and IFN-β. By the early 1980s, genes for these interferons had been cloned, adding further definitive proof that interferons were responsible for interfering with viral replication. Gene cloning also confirmed that IFN-α was encoded by a family of many related genes. The type II IFN (IFN-γ) gene was also isolated around this time.

Interferon was first synthesized manually at Rockefeller University in the lab of Dr. Bruce Merrifield, using solid phase peptide synthesis, one amino acid at a time. He later won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Interferon was scarce and expensive until 1980, when the interferon gene was inserted into bacteria using recombinant DNA technology, allowing mass cultivation and purification from bacterial cultures or derived from yeasts. Interferon can also be produced by recombinant mammalian cells.
Before the early 1970s, large scale production of human interferon had been pioneered by Kari Cantell. He produced large amounts of human alpha interferon from large quantities of human white blood cells collected by the Finnish Blood Bank. Large amounts of human beta interferon were made by superinducing the beta interferon gene in human fibroblast cells.

Cantell&#x27;s and Tan&#x27;s methods of making large amounts of natural interferon were critical for chemical characterisation, clinical trials and the preparation of small amounts of interferon messenger RNA to clone the human alpha and beta interferon genes. The superinduced human beta interferon messenger RNA was prepared by Tan&#x27;s lab for Cetus. to clone the human beta interferon gene in bacteria and the recombinant interferon was developed as &#x27;betaseron&#x27; and approved for the treatment of MS. Superinduction of the human beta interferon gene was also used by Israeli scientists to manufacture human beta interferon.

<text>Israeli settlements, also called Israeli colonies, are the civilian communities built by Israel throughout the Israeli-occupied territories. They are populated by Israeli citizens, almost exclusively of Jewish identity or ethnicity, and have been constructed on lands that Israel has militarily occupied since the Six-Day War in 1967. The international community considers Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law, but Israel disputes this. In 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found in an advisory opinion that Israel&#x27;s occupation was illegal and ruled that Israel had &quot;an obligation to cease immediately all new settlement activities and to evacuate all settlers&quot; from the occupied territories. The expansion of settlements often involves the confiscation of Palestinian land and resources, leading to displacement of Palestinian communities and creating a source of tension and conflict. Settlements are often protected by the Israeli military and are frequently flashpoints for violence against Palestinians. Furthermore, the presence of settlements and Jewish-only bypass roads creates a fragmented Palestinian territory, seriously hindering economic development and freedom of movement for Palestinians.

Currently, Israeli settlements exist in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), which is claimed by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sovereign territory of the State of Palestine, and in the Golan Heights, which is internationally recognized as a part of the sovereign territory of Syria. Through the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law, Israel effectively annexed both territories, though the international community has rejected any change to their status as occupied territory. Although Israel&#x27;s West Bank settlements have been built on territory administered under military rule rather than civil law, Israeli civil law is &quot;pipelined&quot; into the settlements, such that Israeli citizens living there are treated similarly to those living in Israel. Many consider it to be a major obstacle to the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. In &quot;Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory&quot; (2004), the ICJ found that Israel&#x27;s settlements and the then-nascent Israeli West Bank barrier were both in violation of international law; part of the latter has been constructed within the West Bank, as opposed to being entirely on Israel&#x27;s side of the Green Line.

As of January 2023, there are 144 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including 12 in East Jerusalem; the Israeli government administers the West Bank as the Judea and Samaria Area, which does not include East Jerusalem. In addition to the settlements, the West Bank is also hosting at least 196 Israeli outposts, which are settlements that have not been authorized by the Israeli government. In total, over 450,000 Israeli settlers reside in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, with an additional 220,000 Israeli settlers residing in East Jerusalem. Additionally, over 25,000 Israeli settlers live in Syria&#x27;s Golan Heights. Between 1967 and 1982, there were 18 settlements established in the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, though these were dismantled by Israel after the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979. Additionally, as part of the Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005, Israel dismantled all 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the West Bank.

Per the Fourth Geneva Convention, the transfer by an occupying power of its civilian population into the territory it is occupying constitutes a war crime, although Israel disputes that this statute applies to the West Bank. On 20 December 2019, the International Criminal Court announced the opening of an investigation of war crimes in the Palestinian territories. The presence and ongoing expansion of existing settlements by Israel and the construction of outposts is frequently criticized as an obstacle to peace by the PLO, and by a number of third parties, such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the United Nations (UN), Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and the European Union. The UN has repeatedly upheld the view that Israel&#x27;s construction of settlements in the occupied territories constitutes a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. For decades, the United States also designated Israeli settlements as illegal, but the first Trump administration reversed this long-standing policy in November 2019, declaring that &quot;the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not &quot;&quot; inconsistent with international law&quot;; this new policy, in turn, was reversed to the original by the Biden administration in February 2024, once again classifying Israeli settlement expansion as &quot;inconsistent with international law&quot; and matching the official positions of the other three members of the Middle East Quartet.

== Name and characterization ==
Certain observers and Palestinians occasionally use the term &quot;Israeli colonies&quot; as a substitute for the term &quot;settlements&quot;. Settlements range in character from farming communities and frontier villages to urban suburbs and neighborhoods. The four largest settlements, Modi&#x27;in Illit, Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, Beitar Illit and Ariel, have achieved city status. Ariel has 18,000 residents, while the rest have around 37,000 to 55,500 each.

== Housing costs and state subventions ==
Settlement has an economic dimension, much of it driven by the significantly lower costs of housing for Israeli citizens living in Israeli settlements compared to the cost of housing and living in Israel proper. Government spending per citizen in the settlements is double that spent per Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while government spending for settlers in isolated Israeli settlements is three times the Israeli national average. Most of the spending goes to the security of the Israeli citizens living there.

== Number of settlements and inhabitants ==

As of January 2023, there are 144 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including 12 in East Jerusalem. In addition, there are at least 196 Israeli illegal outposts (not sanctioned by the Israeli government) in the West Bank. In total, over 500,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, with an additional 220,000 Jewish settlers residing in East Jerusalem.

Additionally, over 20,000 Israeli citizens live in settlements in the Golan Heights.

== History ==
=== Occupied territories ===
Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied a number of territories. It took over the remainder of the Palestinian Mandate territories of the West Bank including East Jerusalem, from Jordan which had controlled the territories since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, which had held Gaza under occupation since 1949. From Egypt, it also captured the Sinai Peninsula and from Syria it captured most of the Golan Heights, which since 1981 has been administered under the Golan Heights Law.

=== Settlement policy ===
As early as September 1967, Israeli settlement policy was progressively encouraged by the Labor government of Levi Eshkol. The basis for Israeli settlement in the West Bank became the Allon Plan, named after its inventor Yigal Allon. It implied Israeli annexation of major parts of the Israeli-occupied territories, especially East Jerusalem, Gush Etzion and the Jordan Valley. The settlement policy of the government of Yitzhak Rabin was also derived from the Allon Plan.

The first settlement was Kfar Etzion, in the southern West Bank, although that location was outside the Allon Plan. Many settlements began as Nahal settlements. They were established as military outposts and later expanded and populated with civilian inhabitants. According to a secret document dating to 1970, obtained by Haaretz, the settlement of Kiryat Arba was established by confiscating land by military order and falsely representing the project as being strictly for military use while in reality, Kiryat Arba was planned for settler use. The method of confiscating land by military order for establishing civilian settlements was an open secret in Israel throughout the 1970s, but publication of the information was suppressed by the military censor.

In the 1970s, Israel&#x27;s methods for seizing Palestinian land to establish settlements included requisitioning for ostensibly military purposes and spraying of land with poison.

The Likud government of Menahem Begin, from 1977, was more supportive to settlement in other parts of the West Bank, by organizations like Gush Emunim and the Jewish Agency/World Zionist Organization, and intensified the settlement activities. In a government statement, Likud declared that the entire historic Land of Israel is the inalienable heritage of the Jewish people and that no part of the West Bank should be handed over to foreign rule. Ariel Sharon declared in the same year (1977) that there was a plan to settle 2 million Jews in the West Bank by 2000. The government abrogated the prohibition from purchasing occupied land by Israelis; the &quot;Drobles Plan&quot;, a plan for large-scale settlement in the West Bank meant to prevent a Palestinian state under the pretext of security became the framework for its policy. The &quot;Drobles Plan&quot; from the World Zionist Organization, dated October 1978 and named &quot;Master Plan for the Development of Settlements in Judea and Samaria, 1979–1983&quot;, was written by the Jewish Agency director and former Knesset member Matityahu Drobles. In January 1981, the government adopted a follow-up plan from Drobles, dated September 1980 and named &quot;The current state of the settlements in Judea and Samaria&quot;, with more details about settlement strategy and policy.
Since 1967, government-funded settlement projects in the West Bank are implemented by the &quot;Settlement Division&quot; of the World Zionist Organization. Though formally a non-governmental organization, it is funded by the Israeli government and leases lands from the Civil Administration to settle in the West Bank. It is authorized to create settlements in the West Bank on lands licensed to it by the Civil Administration. Traditionally, the Settlement Division has been under the responsibility of the Agriculture Ministry. Since the Oslo Accords, it was always housed within the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO). In 2007, it was moved back to the Agriculture Ministry. In 2009, the Netanyahu Government decided to subject all settlement activities to additional approval of the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister. In 2011, Netanyahu sought to move the Settlement Division again under the direct control of (his own) PMO, and to curtail Defense Minister Ehud Barak&#x27;s authority.

At the presentation of the Oslo II Accord on 5 October 1995 in the Knesset, PM Yitzhak Rabin expounded the Israeli settlement policy in connection with the permanent solution to the conflict. Israel wanted &quot;a Palestinian entity, less than a state, which will be a home to most of the Palestinian residents living in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank&quot;. It wanted to keep settlements beyond the Green Line including Ma&#x27;ale Adumim and Givat Ze&#x27;ev in East Jerusalem. Blocs of settlements should be established in the West Bank. Rabin promised not to return to the 4 June 1967 lines.

In June 1997, the Likud government of Benjamin Netanyahu presented its &quot;Allon Plus Plan&quot;. This plan holds the retention of some 60% of the West Bank, including the &quot;Greater Jerusalem&quot; area with the settlements Gush Etzion and Ma&#x27;aleh Adumim, other large concentrations of settlements in the West Bank, the entire Jordan Valley, a &quot;security area&quot;, and a network of Israeli-only bypass roads.

In the Road map for peace of 2002, which was never implemented, the establishment of a Palestinian state was acknowledged. Outposts would be dismantled. However, many new outposts appeared instead, few were removed. Israel&#x27;s settlement policy remained unchanged. Settlements in East Jerusalem and remaining West Bank were expanded.

While according to official Israeli policy no new settlements were built, at least some hundred unauthorized outposts were established since 2002 with state funding in the 60% of the West Bank that was not under Palestinian administrative control and the population growth of settlers did not diminish.

In 2005, all 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and four in the northern West Bank were forcibly evacuated as part of Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip, known to some in Israel as &quot;the Expulsion&quot;. Nevertheless, the total settler population continued to rise.

After the failure of the Roadmap, several new plans emerged to settle in major parts of the West Bank. In 2011, &quot;Haaretz&quot; revealed the Civil Administration&#x27;s &quot;Blue Line&quot;-plan, written in January 2011, which aims to increase Israeli &quot;state-ownership&quot; of West Bank land (&quot;state lands&quot;) and settlement in strategic areas like the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea area. In March 2012, it was revealed that the Civil Administration over the years covertly allotted 10% of the West Bank for further settlement. Provisional names for future new settlements or settlement expansions were already assigned. The plan includes many Palestinian built-up sites in the Areas A and B.

=== Settlements in the Gaza Strip ===
Land in the Gaza Strip available to its Palestinian inhabitants has historically been limited as a result of Israeli land confiscation and the establishment of settlements. Settlement growth in the Gaza Strip before 1977 was limited, as the Israeli labor party&#x27;s policy of containment preferred the establishment of a collection of settlements along the border of the Strip. At this point, 6 settlements in the Strip existed, Kfar Darom, Netzarim, Morag, Eretz, Katif, and Netzer Hazani. With the Likud party&#x27;s revisionist Zionist policies entering with Begin&#x27;s government, the scale of settlement expansion increased, although the basic policies relating to the settlements did not change. By 1978, 13 settlements had been built as part of a buffer zone along Gaza&#x27;s southern border in Rafah.

The discussions at Camp David that year surrounding the idea of potential future Palestinian autonomy would trigger an increase in settlement expansion in the Gaza Strip, following the Israeli policy of establishing &quot;facts on the ground&quot;. Political economist Sara Roy described this as a policy intended to make the establishment of an independent Palestinian state more difficult. The locations and size of these new settlements would contribute to geographically isolating Palestinian communities from each other.

In the seven years between 1978 and 1985, 11,500 acres of land were confiscated by the Israeli government for the establishment of settlements. By 1991, the settler population in Gaza would reach 3,500 and 4,000 by 1993, or less than 1% of Gaza&#x27;s population. The land available for use by the Jewish settler community exceeded 25% of the total land in Gaza. The ratio of dunams to people was 23 for Jewish settlers, and 0.27 for Palestinians. Comparing the available built-up area available to each of the two groups in 1993, the ratio is 115 people per square mile for Jewish settlers and over 9,000 people per square mile for Palestinians. Sara Roy estimates the increase in Palestinian population density in Gaza due to Israeli policies alone to be an increase of almost 2,000 people per square mile in 1993.

All the settlements were surrounded by electric fences or barbed wire.

While the settlements maintained an isolated economic system, they affected the Gazan economy via land confiscation, the disproportionate consumption of local resources such as water, by overwhelmingly denying work opportunities and through the large disparities in funding (both private and governmental) for economic development.

== Geography and municipal status ==

Some settlements are self-contained cities with a stable population in the tens of thousands, infrastructure, and all other features of permanence. Examples are Beitar Illit (a city of close to 45,000 residents), Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, Modi&#x27;in Illit, and Ariel (almost 20,000 residents). Some are towns with a local council status with populations of 2,000–20,0000, such as Alfei Menashe, Eli, Elkana, Efrat and Kiryat Arba. There are also clusters of villages governed by a local elected committee and regional councils that are responsible for municipal services. Examples are Kfar Adumim, Neve Daniel, Kfar Tapuach and Ateret. Kibbutzim and moshavim in the territories include Argaman, Gilgal, Na&#x27;aran and Yitav. Jewish neighborhoods have been built on the outskirts of Arab neighborhoods, for example in Hebron. In Jerusalem, there are urban neighborhoods where Jews and Arabs live together: the Muslim Quarter, Silwan, Abu Tor, Sheikh Jarrah and Shimon HaTzadik.

Under the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into three separate parts designated as Area A, Area B and Area C. Leaving aside the position of East Jerusalem, all of the settlements are in Area C which comprises about 60% of the West Bank.

== Types of settlement ==
* Cities/towns: Ariel, Betar Illit, Modi&#x27;in Illit and Ma&#x27;ale Adumim.
* Urban suburbs, such as Har Gilo.
* Block settlements, such as Gush Etzion and settlements in the Nablus area.
* Frontier villages, such as those along the Jordan River.
* Outposts, small settlements, some authorized and some unauthorized, often on hilltops. The Sasson Report, commissioned by Ariel Sharon&#x27;s administration, found that several government ministries had cooperated to establish illegal outposts, spending millions of dollars on infrastructure.

== Resettlement of former Jewish communities ==
Some settlements were established on sites where Jewish communities had existed during the British Mandate of Palestine or even since the First Aliyah or ancient times.
* Golan Heights – Bnei Yehuda, founded in 1890, abandoned because of Arab attacks in 1920, rebuilt near the original site in 1972.
* Jerusalem – Jewish presence alongside other peoples since biblical times, various surrounding communities and neighborhoods, including Kfar Shiloah, also known as Silwan—settled by Yemenite Jews in 1884, Jewish residents evacuated in 1938, a few Jewish families move into reclaimed homes in 2004. Other communities: Shimon HaTzadik, Neve Yaakov and Atarot which in post-1967 was rebuilt as an industrial zone.
* Gush Etzion – four communities, established between 1927 and 1947, destroyed 1948, reestablished beginning 1967.
* Hebron – Jewish presence since biblical times, forced out in the wake of the 1929 Hebron massacre, some families returned in 1931 but were evacuated by the British, a few buildings resettled since 1967.
* Dead Sea, northern area – Kalia and Beit HaArava – the former was built in 1934 as a kibbutz for potash mining. The latter was built in 1943 as an agricultural community. Both were abandoned in 1948, and subsequently destroyed by Jordanian forces, and resettled after the Six-Day War.
* Gaza City had a Jewish community for many centuries that was evacuated following riots in 1929. After the Six-Day War, Jewish communities weren&#x27;t built in Gaza City, but in Gush Katif in the southwestern part of the Gaza Strip, f.e. Kfar Darom – established in 1946, evacuated in 1948 after an Egyptian attack, resettled in 1970, evacuated in 2005 as part of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.

== Demographics ==

At the end of 2010, 534,224 Jewish Israelis lived in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. 314,132 of them lived in the 121 authorised settlements and 102 unauthorised settlement outposts on the West Bank, 198,629 were living in East Jerusalem, and almost 20,000 lived in settlements in the Golan Heights.

By 2011, the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem had increased to 328,423 people.

In June 2014, the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem had increased to 382,031 people, with over 20,000 Israeli settlers in the Golan Heights.

In January 2015, the Israeli Interior Ministry gave figures of 389,250 Israeli citizens living in the West Bank outside East Jerusalem.

By the end of 2016, the West Bank Jewish population had risen to 420,899, excluding East Jerusalem, where there were more than 200,000 Jews.

In 2019, the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem had risen to 441,600 individuals, and the number of Israeli settlers in the Golan Heights had risen to 25,261.

In 2020, the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem had reportedly risen to 451,700 individuals, with an additional 220,000 Jews living in East Jerusalem.

Based on various sources, population dispersal can be estimated as follows:
: 1 including Sinai
: 2 Janet Abu-Lughod mentions 500 settlers in Gaza in 1978 (excluding Sinai), and 1,000 in 1980

In addition to internal migration, in large though declining numbers, the settlements absorb annually about 1000 new immigrants from outside Israel. The American Kulanu organization works with such right-wing Israeli settler groups as Amishav and Shavei Israel to settle &quot;lost&quot; Jews of color in such areas where local Palestinians are being displaced. In the 1990s, the annual settler population growth was more than three times the annual population growth in Israel. Population growth has continued in the 2000s. According to the BBC, the settlements in the West Bank have been growing at a rate of 5–6% since 2001. In 2016, there were sixty thousand American Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank.

The establishment of settlements in the Palestinian territories is linked to the displacement of the Palestinian populations as evidenced by a 1979 Security Council Commission which established a link between Israeli settlements and the displacement of the local population. The commission also found that those who remained were under consistent pressure to leave to make room for further settlers who were being encouraged into the area. In conclusion the commission stated that settlement in the Palestinian territories was causing &quot;profound and irreversible changes of a geographic and demographic nature&quot;.

== Administration and local government ==

=== West Bank ===

The Israeli settlements in the West Bank fall under the administrative district of &quot;Judea and Samaria Area&quot;. Since December 2007, approval by both the Israeli Prime Minister and Israeli Defense Minister of all settlement activities (including planning) in the West Bank is required. Authority for planning and construction is held by the Israel Defense Forces Civil Administration.

The area consists of four cities, thirteen local councils and six regional councils.
*Cities: Ariel, Betar Illit, Maale Adumim, Modi&#x27;in Illit;
*Local councils: Alfei Menashe, Beit Aryeh-Ofarim, Beit El, Efrat, Elkana, Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev, Har Adar, Immanuel, Karnei Shomron, Kedumim, Kiryat Arba, Ma&#x27;ale Efraim, Oranit;
*Regional councils: Gush Etzion (&quot;Ezion Bloc&quot;), Har Hebron (&quot;Mount Hebron&quot;), Matte Binyamin (&quot;Staff of Benjamin&quot;, named after the ancient Israelite tribe that dwelled in the area), Megilot (&quot;Scrolls&quot;, named after the Dead Sea scrolls, which were discovered in the area), Shomron Regional Council (&quot;Samaria&quot;), Biq&#x27;at HaYarden (&quot;Jordan valley&quot;).
The Yesha Council (, &quot;Moatzat Yesha&quot;, a Hebrew acronym for Judea, Samaria and Gaza) is the umbrella organization of municipal councils in the West Bank.

The actual buildings of the Israeli settlements cover only 1 percent of the West Bank, but their jurisdiction and their regional councils extend to about 42 percent of the West Bank, according to the Israeli NGO B&#x27;Tselem. Yesha Council chairman Dani Dayan disputes the figures and claims that the settlements only control 9.2 percent of the West Bank.

Between 2001 and 2007 more than 10,000 Israeli settlement units were built, while 91 permits were issued for Palestinian construction, and 1,663 Palestinian structures were demolished in Area C.

West Bank Palestinians have their cases tried in Israel&#x27;s military courts while Jewish Israeli settlers living in the same occupied territory are tried in civil courts. The arrangement has been described as &quot;de facto segregation&quot; by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
A bill to formally extend Israeli law to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank was rejected in 2012. The basic military laws governing the West Bank are influenced by what is called the &quot;pipelining&quot; of Israeli legislation. As a result of &quot;enclave law&quot;, large portions of Israeli civil law are applied to Israeli settlements and Israeli residents in the occupied territories.

On 31 August 2014, Israel announced it was appropriating 400 hectares of land in the West Bank to eventually house 1,000 Israel families. The appropriation was described as the largest in more than 30 years. According to reports on Israel Radio, the development is a response to the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers.

In March 2024 and during the Israel-Hamas war, it was announced that Israel was planning on building more than 3,300 new homes in the Kedar and Ma&#x27;ale Adumim settlement in the West Bank. The settlement expansion was announced by Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich after three Palestinians opened fire near the Ma&#x27;ale Adumim settlement, killing one and wounding five, and drew criticism from the US due to increasing tensions. During the Israel-Hamas war, the lines between settlers and the military were described as having become &quot;indistinguishable&quot;.

=== East Jerusalem ===
East Jerusalem is defined in the Jerusalem Law of 1980 as part of Israel and its capital, Jerusalem. As such it is administered as part of the city and its district, the Jerusalem District. Pre-1967 residents of East Jerusalem and their descendants have residency status in the city but many have refused Israeli citizenship. Thus, the Israeli government maintains an administrative distinction between Israeli citizens and non-citizens in East Jerusalem, but the Jerusalem municipality does not.

=== Golan Heights ===
The Golan Heights is administered under Israeli civil law as the Golan sub-district, a part of the Northern District. Israel makes no legal or administrative distinction between pre-1967 communities in the Golan Heights (mainly Druze) and the post-1967 settlements.

=== Sinai Peninsula ===

After the capture of the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War, settlements were established along the Gulf of Aqaba and in northeast Sinai, just below the Gaza Strip. Israel had plans to expand the settlement of Yamit into a city with a population of 200,000, though the actual population of Yamit did not exceed 3,000. The Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt in stages beginning in 1979 as part of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty. As required by the treaty, in 1982 Israel evacuated the Israeli civilian population from the 18 Sinai settlements in Sinai. In some instances evacuations were done forcefully, such as the evacuation of Yamit. All the settlements were then dismantled.

=== Gaza Strip ===

Before Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan in which the Israeli settlements were evacuated, there were in the Gaza Strip under the administration of the Hof Aza Regional Council. The land was allocated in such a way that each Israeli settler disposed of 400 times the land available to the Palestinian refugees, and 20 times the volume of water allowed to the peasant farmers of the Strip.

== Legal status ==

The International Court of Justice delivered a landmark advisory opinion in July 2024 that Israel&#x27;s occupation of West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip was illegal, that Israel had &quot;an obligation to cease immediately all new settlement activities and to evacuate all settlers&quot; from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and that Israel should &quot;make reparation for the damage caused to all&quot; the people of such lands.

The consensus view in the international community is that the existence of Israeli settlements in the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights is in violation of international law. The Fourth Geneva Convention includes statements such as &quot;the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies&quot;. On 20 December 2019, International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced an International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine into alleged war crimes committed during the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. At present, the view of the international community, as reflected in numerous UN resolutions, regards the building and existence of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as a violation of international law. UN Security Council Resolution 446 refers to the Fourth Geneva Convention as the applicable international legal instrument, and calls upon Israel to desist from transferring its own population into the territories or changing their demographic makeup. The reconvened Conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions has declared the settlements illegal as has the primary judicial organ of the UN, the International Court of Justice.

The position of successive Israeli governments is that all authorized settlements are entirely legal and consistent with international law. In practice, Israel does not accept that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies &quot;de jure&quot;, but has stated that on humanitarian issues it will govern itself &quot;de facto&quot; by its provisions, without specifying which these are. The scholar and jurist Eugene Rostow has disputed the illegality of authorized settlements.

Under Israeli law, West Bank settlements must meet specific criteria to be legal. In 2009, there were approximately 100 small communities that did not meet these criteria and are referred to as illegal outposts.

In 2014 twelve EU countries warned businesses against involving themselves in the settlements. According to the warnings, economic activities relating to the settlements involve legal and economic risks stemming from the fact that the settlements are built on occupied land not recognized as Israel&#x27;s.

=== Illegality arguments ===
The consensus of the international community – the vast majority of states, the overwhelming majority of legal experts, the International Court of Justice and the UN – is that settlements are in violation of international law.
After the Six-Day War, in 1967, Theodor Meron, legal counsel to the Israeli Foreign Ministry stated in a legal opinion to the Prime Minister,

&quot;My conclusion is that civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention.&quot;

This legal opinion was sent to Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. However, it was not made public at the time. The Labor cabinet allowed settlements despite the warning. This paved the way for future settlement growth. In 2007, Meron stated that &quot;I believe that I would have given the same opinion today.&quot;

In 1978, the Legal Adviser of the Department of State of the United States reached the same conclusion.

The International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion, has since ruled that Israel is in breach of international law by establishing settlements in Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. The Court maintains that Israel cannot rely on its right of self-defense or necessity to impose a regime that violates international law. The Court also ruled that Israel violates basic human rights by impeding liberty of movement and the inhabitants&#x27; right to work, health, education and an adequate standard of living.

International intergovernmental organizations such as the Conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, major organs of the United Nations, the European Union, and Canada, also regard the settlements as a violation of international law. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination wrote that &quot;The status of the settlements was clearly inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention, which, as noted in the Committee&#x27;s General Recommendation XIX, prohibited all forms of racial segregation in all countries. There is a consensus among publicists that the prohibition of racial discrimination, irrespective of territories, is an imperative norm of international law.&quot; Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch have also characterized the settlements as a violation of international law.

In late January 2013 a report drafted by three justices, presided over by Christine Chanet, and issued by the United Nations Human Rights Council declared that Jewish settlements constituted a creeping annexation based on multiple violations of the Geneva Conventions and international law, and stated that if Palestine ratified the Rome Accord, Israel could be tried for &quot;gross violations of human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law.&quot; A spokesman for Israel&#x27;s Foreign Ministry declared the report &#x27;unfortunate&#x27; and accused the UN&#x27;s Human Rights Council of a &quot;systematically one-sided and biased approach towards Israel.&quot;

The Supreme Court of Israel, with a variety of different justices sitting, has repeatedly stated that Israel&#x27;s presence in the West Bank is in violation of international law.

=== Legality arguments ===
Four prominent jurists cited the concept of the &quot;sovereignty vacuum&quot; in the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War to describe the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza: Yehuda Zvi Blum in 1968, Elihu Lauterpacht in 1968, Julius Stone in 1969 and 1981, and Stephen M. Schwebel in 1970. Eugene V. Rostow also argued in 1979 that the occupied territories&#x27; legal status was undetermined.
*Stephen M. Schwebel made three distinctions specific to the Israeli situation to claim that the territories were seized in self-defense and that Israel has more title to them than the previous holders.
*Julius Stone also wrote that &quot;Israel&#x27;s presence in all these areas pending negotiation of new borders is entirely lawful, since Israel entered them lawfully in self-defense.&quot; He argued that it would be an &quot;irony bordering on the absurd&quot; to read Article 49(6) as meaning that the State of Israel was obliged to ensure (by force if necessary) that areas with a millennial association with Jewish life shall be forever &quot;judenrein&quot;.
Professor Ben Saul took exception to this view, arguing that Article 49(6) can be read to include voluntary or assisted transfers, as indeed it was in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which had expressed this interpretation in the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion (2003).

Israel maintains that a temporary use of land and buildings for various purposes is permissible under a plea of military necessity and that the settlements fulfilled security needs. Israel argues that its settlement policy is consistent with international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, while recognising that some settlements have been constructed illegally on private land. The Israeli Supreme Court has ruled that the power of the Civil Administration and the Military Commander in the occupied territories is limited by the entrenched customary rules of public international law as codified in the Hague Regulations. In 1998 the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs produced &quot;The International Criminal Court Background Paper&quot;. It concludesInternational law has long recognised that there are crimes of such severity they should be considered &quot;international crimes.&quot; Such crimes have been established in treaties such as the Genocide Convention and the Geneva Conventions... The following are Israel&#x27;s primary issues of concern [i.e. with the rules of the ICC]: The inclusion of settlement activity as a &quot;war crime&quot; is a cynical attempt to abuse the Court for political ends. The implication that the transfer of civilian population to occupied territories can be classified as a crime equal in gravity to attacks on civilian population centres or mass murder is preposterous and has no basis in international law.

A UN conference was held in Rome in 1998, where Israel was one of seven countries to vote against the Rome Statute to establish the International Criminal Court. Israel was opposed to a provision that included as a war crime the transfer of civilian populations into territory the government occupies. Israel has signed the statute, but not ratified the treaty.

== Land ownership ==
A 1996 amendment to an Israeli military order states that land privately owned can not be part of a settlement unless the land in question has been confiscated for military purposes. In 2006 Peace Now acquired a report, which it claims was leaked from the Israeli Government&#x27;s Civil Administration, indicating that up to 40 percent of the land Israel plans to retain in the West Bank is privately owned by Palestinians. Peace Now called this a violation of Israeli law. Peace Now published a comprehensive report about settlements on private lands. In the wake of a legal battle, Peace Now lowered the figure to 32 percent, which the Civil Administration also denied. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;The 38-page report offers what appears to be a comprehensive argument against the Israeli government&#x27;s contention that it avoids building on private land, drawing on the state&#x27;s own data to make the case.&quot;

In February 2008, the Civil Administration stated that the land on which more than a third of West Bank settlements was built had been expropriated by the IDF for &quot;security purposes.&quot; The unauthorized seizure of private Palestinian land was defined by the Civil Administration itself as &#x27;theft.&#x27; According to B&#x27;Tselem, more than 42 percent of the West Bank are under control of the Israeli settlements, 21 percent of which was seized from private Palestinian owners, much of it in violation of the 1979 Israeli Supreme Court decision.

In 1979, the government decided to extend settlements or build new ones only on &quot;state lands&quot;.

A secret database, drafted by a retired senior officer, Baruch Spiegel, on orders from former defense minister Shaul Mofaz, found that some settlements deemed legal by Israel were illegal outposts, and that large portions of Ofra, Elon Moreh and Beit El were built on private Palestinian land. The &quot;Spiegel report&quot; was revealed by Haaretz in 2009. Many settlements are largely built on private lands, without approval of the Israeli Government. According to Israel, the bulk of the land was vacant, was leased from the state, or bought fairly from Palestinian landowners.

Invoking the Absentees&#x27; Property Laws to transfer, sell or lease property in East Jerusalem owned by Palestinians who live elsewhere without compensation has been criticized both inside and outside of Israel. Opponents of the settlements claim that &quot;vacant&quot; land belonged to Arabs who fled or collectively to an entire village, a practice that developed under Ottoman rule. B&#x27;Tselem charged that Israel is using the absence of modern legal documents for the communal land as a legal basis for expropriating it. These &quot;abandoned lands&quot; are sometimes laundered through a series of fraudulent sales.

According to Amira Hass, one of the techniques used by Israel to expropriate Palestinian land is to place desired areas under a &quot;military firing zone&quot; classification, and then issue orders for the evacuation of Palestinians from the villages in that range while allowing contiguous Jewish settlements to remain unaffected.

== Effects on Palestinian human rights ==
Amnesty International argues that Israel&#x27;s settlement policy is discriminatory and a violation of Palestinian human rights. B&#x27;Tselem claims that Israeli travel restrictions impact on Palestinian freedom of movement and Palestinian human rights have been violated in Hebron due to the presence of the settlers within the city. According to B&#x27;Tselem, over fifty percent of West Bank land expropriated from Palestinians has been used to establish settlements and create reserves of land for their future expansion. The seized lands mainly benefit the settlements and Palestinians cannot use them. The roads built by Israel in the West Bank to serve the settlements are closed to Palestinian vehicles&#x27; and act as a barrier often between villages and the lands on which they subsist.

Human Rights Watch and other human rights observer volunteer regularly file reports on &quot;settler violence&quot;, referring to stoning and shooting incidents involving Israeli settlers. Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Gaza and Hebron have led to violent settler protests and disputes over land and resources. Meron Benvenisti described the settlement enterprise as a &quot;commercial real estate project that conscripts Zionist rhetoric for profit.&quot;

The construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has been criticized as an infringement on Palestinian human and land rights. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 10% of the West Bank would fall on the Israeli side of the barrier.

In July 2012, the UN Human Rights Council decided to set up a probe into Jewish settlements. The report of the independent international fact-finding mission which investigated the &quot;implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory&quot; was published in February 2013.

In February 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights published a list of 112 companies linked to activities related to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

== Economy ==

Goods produced in Israeli settlements are able to stay competitive on the global market, in part because of massive state subsidies they receive from the Israeli government. Farmers and producers are given state assistance, while companies that set up in the territories receive tax breaks and direct government subsidies. An Israeli government fund has also been established to help companies pay customs penalties. Palestinian officials estimate that settlers sell goods worth some $500 million to the Palestinian market. Israel has built 16 industrial zones, containing roughly 1000 industrial plants, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem on acreage that consumes large parts of the territory planned for a future Palestinian state. According to Jodi Rudoren these installations both entrench the occupation and provide work for Palestinians, even those opposed to it. The 16 parks are located at Shaked, Beka&#x27;ot, Baran, Karnei Shomron, Emmanuel, Barkan, Ariel, Shilo, Halamish, Ma&#x27;ale Efraim, Sha&#x27;ar Binyamin, Atarot, Mishor Adumim, Gush Etzion, Kiryat Arba and Metarim (2001).
In spite of this, the West Bank settlements have failed to develop a self-sustaining local economy. About 60% of the settler workforce commutes to Israel for work. The settlements rely primarily on the labor of their residents in Israel proper rather than local manufacturing, agriculture, or research and development. Of the industrial parks in the settlements, there are only two significant ones, at Ma&#x27;ale Adumim and Barkan, with most of the workers there being Palestinian. Only a few hundred settler households cultivate agricultural land, and rely primarily on Palestinian labor in doing so.

Settlement has an economic dimension, much of it driven by the significantly lower costs of housing for Israeli citizens living in Israeli settlements compared to the cost of housing and living in Israel proper. Government spending per citizen in the settlements is double that spent per Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while government spending for settlers in isolated Israeli settlements is three times the Israeli national average. Most of the spending goes to the security of the Israeli citizens living there.

=== Export to EU ===
According to Israeli government estimates, $230 million worth of settler goods including fruit, vegetables, cosmetics, textiles and toys are exported to the EU each year, accounting for approximately 2% of all Israeli exports to Europe. A 2013 report of Profundo revealed that at least 38 Dutch companies imported settlement products.

European Union law requires a distinction to be made between goods originating in Israel and those from the occupied territories. The former benefit from preferential custom treatment according to the EU-Israel Association Agreement (2000); the latter don&#x27;t, having been explicitly excluded from the agreement. In practice, however, settler goods often avoid mandatory customs through being labelled as originating in Israel, while European customs authorities commonly fail to complete obligatory postal code checks of products to ensure they have not originated in the occupied territories.

In 2009, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs issued new guidelines concerning labelling of goods imported from the West Bank. The new guidelines require labelling to clarify whether West Bank products originate from settlements or from the Palestinian economy. Israel&#x27;s foreign ministry said that the UK was &quot;catering to the demands of those whose ultimate goal is the boycott of Israeli products&quot;; but this was denied by the UK government, who said that the aim of the new regulations was to allow consumers to choose for themselves what produce they buy. Denmark has similar legislation requiring food products from settlements in the occupied territories to be accurately labelled. In June 2022, Norway also stated that it would begin complying with EU regulation to label produce originating from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Golan Heights as such.

On 12 November 2019 the Court of Justice of the European Union in a ruling covering all territory Israel captured in the 1967 war decided that labels on foodstuffs must not imply that goods produced in occupied territory came from Israel itself and must &quot;prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity&quot;. In its ruling, the court said that failing to inform EU consumers they were potentially buying goods produced in settlements denies them access to &quot;ethical considerations and considerations relating to the observance of international law&quot;.

In January 2019 the Dail (Ireland&#x27;s lower house) voted in favour, by 78 to 45, of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill. This piece of legislation prohibits the purchasing of any good and/or service from the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem or West Bank settlements. The Bill made no further progress until 2024 when the then government sought legal advice from the Attorney General in response to the International Court of Justice&#x27;s ruling on Israel&#x27;s occupation of the Palestinian territories. Following the Attorney General&#x27;s advice the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin confirmed on 22 October 2024 that the Bill would be &quot;reviewed and amendments prepared in order to bring in into line with the Constitution and EU Law&quot;. On 31 October 2024, it was reported that a technical blockage of the Bill would be removed to allow it to proceed to committee stage, however the Bill was not passed before the Dáil was suspended &quot;sine die&quot; on the 7 November 2024 marking the end of the 33rd Dáil.

A petition under the European Citizens&#x27; Initiative, submitted in September 2021, was accepted on 20 February 2022. The petition seeks the adoption of legislation to ban trade with unlawful settlements. The petition requires a million signatures from across the EU and has received support from civil society groups including Human Rights Watch.

=== Palestinian economy and resources ===
A Palestinian report argued in 2011 that settlements have a detrimental effect on the Palestinian economy, equivalent to about 85% of the nominal gross domestic product of Palestine, and that the &quot;occupation enterprise&quot; allows the state of Israel and commercial firms to profit from Palestinian natural resources and tourist potential. A 2013 report published by the World Bank analysed the impact that the limited access to Area C lands and resources had on the Palestinian economy. While settlements represent a single axis of control, it is the largest with 68% of the Area C lands reserved for the settlements. The report goes on to calculate that access to the lands and resources of Area C, including the territory in and around settlements, would increase the Palestinian GDP by some $3.5 billion (or 35%) per year.

The Israeli Supreme Court has ruled that Israeli companies are entitled to exploit the West Bank&#x27;s natural resources for economic gain, and that international law must be &quot;adapted&quot; to the &quot;reality on the ground&quot; of long-term occupation.

== Palestinian labour ==
Due to the availability of jobs offering twice the prevailing salary of the West Bank (), as well as high unemployment, tens of thousands of Palestinians work in Israeli settlements. According to the Manufacturers Association of Israel, some 22,000 Palestinians were employed in construction, agriculture, manufacturing and service industries. An Al-Quds University study in 2011 found that 82% of Palestinian workers said they would prefer to not work in Israeli settlements if they had alternative employment in the West Bank.

Palestinians have been highly involved in the construction of settlements in the West Bank. In 2013, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics released their survey showing that the number of Palestinian workers who are employed by the Jewish settlements increased from 16,000 to 20,000 in the first quarter. The survey also found that Palestinians who work in Israel and the settlements are paid more than twice their salary compared to what they receive from Palestinian employers.

In 2008, Kav LaOved charged that Palestinians who work in Israeli settlements are not granted basic protections of Israeli labor law. Instead, they are employed under Jordanian labor law, which does not require minimum wage, payment for overtime and other social rights. In 2007, the Supreme Court of Israel ruled that Israeli labor law does apply to Palestinians working in West Bank settlements and applying different rules in the same work place constituted discrimination. The ruling allowed Palestinian workers to file lawsuits in Israeli courts. In 2008, the average sum claimed by such lawsuits stood at 100,000 shekels.

According to the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, 63% of Palestinians opposed PA plans to prosecute Palestinians who work in the settlements. However, 72% of Palestinians support a boycott of the products they sell. Although the Palestinian Authority has criminalized working in the settlements, the director-general at the Palestinian Ministry of Labor, Samer Salameh, described the situation in February 2014 as being &quot;caught between two fires&quot;. He said &quot;We strongly discourage work in the settlements, since the entire enterprise is illegal and illegitimate...but given the high unemployment rate and the lack of alternatives, we do not enforce the law that criminalizes work in the settlements.&quot;

== Violence ==

=== Israeli settler violence ===


Gush Emunim Underground was a militant organization that operated in 1979–1984. The organization planned attacks on Palestinian officials and the Dome of the Rock. In 1994, Baruch Goldstein of Hebron, a member of Kach carried out the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, killing 29 Muslim worshipers and injuring 125. The attack was widely condemned by the Israeli government and Jewish community. The Palestinian leadership has accused Israel of &quot;encouraging and enabling&quot; settler violence in a bid to provoke Palestinian riots and violence in retaliation. Violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers against Palestinians constitutes terrorism according to the U.S. Department of State, and former IDF Head of Central Command Avi Mizrahi stated that such violence constitutes &quot;terror.&quot;

In mid-2008, a UN report recorded 222 acts of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and IDF troops compared with 291 in 2007. This trend reportedly increased in 2009. Maj-Gen Shamni said that the number had risen from a few dozen individuals to hundreds, and called it &quot;a very grave phenomenon.&quot; In 2008–2009, the defense establishment adopted a harder line against the extremists. This group responded with a tactic dubbed &quot;price tagging&quot;, vandalizing Palestinian property whenever police or soldiers were sent in to dismantle outposts. From January through to September 2013, 276 attacks by settlers against Palestinians were recorded.

Leading religious figures in the West Bank have harshly criticized these tactics. Rabbi Menachem Froman of Tekoa said that &quot;Targeting Palestinians and their property is a shocking thing, ... It&#x27;s an act of hurting humanity. ... This builds a wall of fire between Jews and Arabs.&quot; The Yesha Council and Hanan Porat also condemned such actions. Other rabbis have been accused of inciting violence against non-Jews. In response to settler violence, the Israeli government said that it would increase law enforcement and cut off aid to illegal outposts. Some settlers are thought to lash out at Palestinians because they are &quot;easy victims.&quot; The United Nations accused Israel of failing to intervene and arrest settlers suspected of violence. In 2008, Haaretz wrote that &quot;Israeli society has become accustomed to seeing lawbreaking settlers receive special treatment and no other group could similarly attack Israeli law enforcement agencies without being severely punished.&quot;

In September 2011, settlers vandalized a mosque and an army base. They slashed tires and cut cables of 12 army vehicles and sprayed graffiti. In November 2011, the United Nations Office for Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA) in the Palestinian territories published a report on settler violence that showed a significant rise compared to 2009 and 2010. The report covered physical violence and property damage such as uprooted olive trees, damaged tractors and slaughtered sheep. The report states that 90% of complaints filed by Palestinians have been closed without charge.

According to EU reports, Israel has created an &quot;atmosphere of impunity&quot; for Jewish attackers, which is seen as tantamount to tacit approval by the state. In the West Bank, Jews and Palestinians live under two different legal regimes and it is difficult for Palestinians to lodge complaints, which must be filed in Hebrew in Israeli settlements.

The 27 ministers of foreign affairs of the European Union published a report in May 2012 strongly denouncing policies of the State of Israel in the West Bank and denouncing &quot;continuous settler violence and deliberate provocations against Palestinian civilians.&quot; The report by all EU ministers called &quot;on the government of Israel to bring the perpetrators to justice and to comply with its obligations under international law.&quot;

In July 2014, a day after the burial of three murdered Israeli teens, Khdeir, a 16-year-old Palestinian, was forced into a car by 3 Israeli settlers on an East Jerusalem street. His family immediately reported the fact to Israeli Police who located his charred body a few hours later at Givat Shaul in the Jerusalem Forest. Preliminary results from the autopsy suggested that he was beaten and burnt while still alive. The murder suspects explained the attack as a response to the June abduction and murder of three Israeli teens. The murders contributed to a breakout of hostilities in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.
In July 2015, a similar incident occurred where Israeli settlers made an arson attack on two Palestinian houses, one of which was empty; however, the other was occupied, resulting in the burning to death of a Palestinian infant; the four other members of his family were evacuated to the hospital suffering serious injuries. These two incidents received condemnation from the United States, European Union and the IDF. The European Union criticized Israel for &quot;failing to protect the Palestinian population&quot;.

=== Olive trees ===
While the economy of the Palestinian territories has shown signs of growth, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported that Palestinian olive farming has suffered. According to the ICRC, 10,000 olive trees were cut down or burned by settlers in 2007–2010. Foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the report ignored official PA data showing that the economic situation of Palestinians had improved substantially, citing Mahmoud Abbas&#x27;s comment to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in May 2009, where he said &quot;in the West Bank, we have a good reality, the people are living a normal life.&quot;

&quot;Haaretz&quot; blamed the violence during the olive harvest on a handful of extremists. In 2010, trees belonging to both Jews and Arabs were cut down, poisoned or torched. In the first two weeks of the harvest, 500 trees owned by Palestinians and 100 trees owned by Jews had been vandalized. In October 2013, 100 trees were cut down.

Violent attacks on olive trees seem to be facilitated by the apparently systematic refusal of the Israeli authorities to allow Palestinians to visit their own groves, sometimes for years, especially in cases where the groves are deemed to be too close to settlements.

=== Palestinian violence against settlers ===
Israeli civilians living in settlements have been targeted by violence from armed Palestinian groups. These groups, according to Human Rights Watch, assert that settlers are &quot;legitimate targets&quot; that have &quot;forfeited their civilian status by residing in settlements that are illegal under international humanitarian law.&quot; Both Human Rights Watch and B&#x27;tselem rejected this argument on the basis that the legal status of the settlements has no effect on the civilian status of their residents. Human Rights Watch said the &quot;prohibition against intentional attacks against civilians is absolute.&quot; B&#x27;tselem said &quot;The settlers constitute a distinctly civilian population, which is entitled to all the protections granted civilians by international law. The Israeli security forces&#x27; use of land in the settlements or the membership of some settlers in the Israeli security forces does not affect the status of the other residents living among them, and certainly does not make them proper targets of attack.&quot;

Fatal attacks on settlers have included firing of rockets and mortars and drive-by shootings, also targeting infants and children. Violent incidents include the murder of Shalhevet Pass, a ten-month-old baby shot by a Palestinian sniper in Hebron, and the murder of two teenagers by unknown perpetrators on 8 May 2001, whose bodies were hidden in a cave near Tekoa, a crime that Israeli authorities suggest may have been committed by Palestinian terrorists. In the Bat Ayin axe attack, children in Bat Ayin were attacked by a Palestinian wielding an axe and a knife. A 13-year-old boy was killed and another was seriously wounded. Rabbi Meir Hai, a father of seven, was killed in a drive-by shooting. In August 2011, five members of one family were killed in their beds. The victims were the father Ehud (Udi) Fogel, the mother Ruth Fogel, and three of their six children—Yoav, 11, Elad, 4, and Hadas, the youngest, a three-month-old infant. According to David Ha&#x27;ivri, and as reported by multiple sources, the infant was decapitated.

==== Pro-Palestinian activist violence ====
Pro-Palestinian activists who hold regular protests near the settlements have been accused of stone-throwing, physical assault and provocation. In 2008, Avshalom Peled, head of the Israel Police&#x27;s Hebron district, called &quot;left-wing&quot; activity in the city dangerous and provocative, and accused activists of antagonizing the settlers in the hope of getting a reaction.

== Environmental issues ==
Municipal Environmental Associations of Judea and Samaria, an environmental awareness group, was established by the settlers to address sewage treatment problems and cooperate with the Palestinian Authority on environmental issues. According to a 2004 report by Friends of the Earth Middle East, settlers account for 10% of the population in the West Bank but produce 25% of the sewage output. Beit Duqqu and Qalqilyah have accused settlers of polluting their farmland and villagers claim children have become ill after swimming in a local stream. Legal action was taken against 14 settlements by the Israeli Ministry of the Environment. The Palestinian Authority has also been criticized by environmentalists for not doing more to prevent water pollution. Settlers and Palestinians share the mountain aquifer as a water source, and both generate sewage and industrial effluents that endanger the aquifer. Friends of the Earth Middle East claimed that sewage treatment was inadequate in both sectors. Sewage from Palestinian sources was estimated at 46 million cubic meters a year, and sources from settler sources at 15 million cubic meters a year. A 2004 study found that sewage was not sufficiently treated in many settlements, while sewage from Palestinian villages and cities flowed into unlined cesspits, streams and the open environment with no treatment at all.

In a 2007 study, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, found that Palestinian towns and cities produced 56 million cubic meters of sewage per year, 94 percent discharged without adequate treatment, while Israeli sources produced 17.5 million cubic meters per year, 31.5 percent without adequate treatment.

According to Palestinian environmentalists, the settlers operate industrial and manufacturing plants that can create pollution as many do not conform to Israeli standards. In 2005, an old quarry between Kedumim and Nablus was slated for conversion into an industrial waste dump. Pollution experts warned that the dump would threaten Palestinian water sources.

== Impact on Palestinian demographics ==

The Consortium for Applied Research on International Migration (CARIM) has reported in their 2011 migration profile for Palestine that the reasons for individuals to leave the country are similar to those of other countries in the region and they attribute less importance to the specific political situation of the occupied Palestinian territory. Human Rights Watch in 2010 reported that Israeli settlement policies have had the effect of &quot;forcing residents to leave their communities&quot;.

In 2008, Condoleezza Rice suggested sending Palestinian refugees to South America, which might reduce pressure on Israel to withdraw from the settlements. Sushil P. Seth speculates that Israelis might feel that increasing settlements will force many Palestinians to flee to other countries and that the remainder will be forced to live under Israeli terms. Speaking anonymously with regard to Israeli policies in the South Hebron Hills, a UN expert said that the Israeli crackdown on alternative energy infrastructures like solar panels is part of a deliberate strategy in Area C.
&quot;From December 2010 to April 2011, we saw a systematic targeting of the water infrastructure in Hebron, Bethlehem and the Jordan valley. Now, in the last couple of months, they are targeting electricity. Two villages in the area have had their electrical poles demolished. There is this systematic effort by the civil administration targeting all Palestinian infrastructure in Hebron. They are hoping that by making it miserable enough, they [the Palestinians] will pick up and leave.&quot;
Approximately 1,500 people in 16 communities are dependent on energy produced by these installations duct business are threatened with work stoppage orders from the Israeli administration on their installation of alternative power infrastructure, and demolition orders expected to follow will darken the homes of 500 people.

== Educational institutions ==

Ariel University, formerly the College of Judea and Samaria, is the major Israeli institution of higher education in the West Bank. With close to 13,000 students, it is Israel&#x27;s largest public college. The college was accredited in 1994 and awards bachelor&#x27;s degrees in arts, sciences, technology, architecture and physical therapy. On 17 July 2012, the Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria voted to grant the institution full university status.

Teacher training colleges include Herzog College in Alon Shvut and Orot Israel College in Elkana. Ohalo College is located in Katzrin, in the Golan Heights. Curricula at these institutions are overseen by the Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria (CHE-JS).

In March 2012, The Shomron Regional Council was awarded the Israeli Ministry of Education&#x27;s first prize National Education Award in recognizing its excellence in investing substantial resources in the educational system. The Shomron Regional Council achieved the highest marks in all parameters (9.28 / 10). Gershon Mesika, the head of the regional council, declared that the award was a certificate of honour of its educators and the settlement youth who proved their quality and excellence.

== Strategic significance ==

In 1983 an Israeli government plan entitled &quot;Master Plan and Development Plan for Settlement in Samaria and Judea&quot; envisaged placing a &quot;maximally large Jewish population&quot; in priority areas to accomplish incorporation of the West Bank in the Israeli &quot;national system&quot;. According to Ariel Sharon, strategic settlement locations would work to preclude the formation of a Palestinian state.

Palestinians argue that the policy of settlements constitutes an effort to preempt or sabotage a peace treaty that includes Palestinian sovereignty, and claim that the presence of settlements harm the ability to have a viable and contiguous state. This was also the view of the Israeli Vice Prime Minister Haim Ramon in 2008, saying &quot;the pressure to enlarge Ofra and other settlements does not stem from a housing shortage, but rather is an attempt to undermine any chance of reaching an agreement with the Palestinians ...&quot;

The Israel Foreign Ministry asserts that some settlements are legitimate, as they took shape when there was no operative diplomatic arrangement, and thus they did not violate any agreement. Based on this, they assert that:

* Prior to the signing of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty, the eruption of the First Intifada, down to the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, Israeli governments on the left and right argued that the settlements were of strategic and tactical importance. The location of the settlements was primarily chosen based on the threat of an attack by the bordering hostile countries of Jordan, Syria, and Egypt and possible routes of advance into Israeli population areas. These settlements were seen as contributing to the security of Israel at a time when peace treaties had not been signed.

== Dismantling of settlements ==
An early evacuation took place in 1982 as part of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty, when Israel was required to evacuate its settlers from the 18 Sinai settlements. Arab parties to the conflict had demanded the dismantlement of the settlements as a condition for peace with Israel. The evacuation was carried out with force in some instances, for example in Yamit. The settlements were demolished, as it was feared that settlers might try to return to their homes after the evacuation.

Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip took place in 2005. It involved the evacuation of settlements in the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank, including all 21 settlements in Gaza and four in the West Bank, while retaining control over Gaza&#x27;s borders, coastline, and airspace. Most of these settlements had existed since the early 1980s, some were over 30 years old; the total population involved was more than 8,000. There was significant opposition to the plan among parts of the Israeli public, and especially those living in the territories. George W. Bush said that a permanent peace deal would have to reflect &quot;demographic realities&quot; in the West Bank regarding Israel&#x27;s settlements.

The Israeli human rights group GISHA maintains that despite the disengagement, Israel continues to occupy Gaza because it maintains its control over the area. For example, Israel maintains control over Gaza&#x27;s airspace and waters, its borders (specifically, passage of goods and people to and from Gaza), the population registry, its telecommunications networks, and the collection of customs and tax on imports. GISHA also reports that Israel continues to control Gaza&#x27;s infrastructure through its control over the supply of resources such as electricity. In addition, under the disengagement plan, Israel can prevent the PA from reopening its airport or seaport.

Within the former settlements, almost all buildings were demolished by Israel, with the exception of certain government and religious structures, which were completely emptied. Under an international arrangement, greenhouses were left to assist the Palestinian economy although half had been demolished by the settlers two months prior to the disengagement. The reduction in greenhouse space and increased restrictions on exports reduced the viability of the project. After the redeployment of Israeli troops to the Gaza border, 30% of the greenhouses suffered various degrees of damage due to Palestinian looters stealing, for example, hoses and irrigation equipment. Following the withdrawal, many of the former synagogues were torched and destroyed by Palestinians.

Some believe that settlements need not necessarily be dismantled and evacuated, even if Israel withdraws from the territory where they stand, as they can remain under Palestinian rule. These ideas have been expressed both by left-wing Israelis, and by Palestinians who advocate the two-state solution, and by extreme Israeli right-wingers and settlers who object to any dismantling and claim links to the land that are stronger than the political boundaries of the state of Israel.

The Israeli government has often threatened to dismantle outposts. Some have actually been dismantled, occasionally with use of force; this led to settler violence.

== Palestinian statehood bid of 2011 ==
American refusal to declare the settlements illegal was said to be the determining factor in the 2011 attempt to declare Palestinian statehood at the United Nations, the so-called Palestine 194 initiative.

Israel announced additional settlements in response to the Palestinian diplomatic initiative and Germany responded by moving to stop deliveries to Israel of submarines capable of carrying nuclear weapons.

Finally in 2012, several European states switched to either abstain or vote for statehood in response to continued settlement construction. Israel approved further settlements in response to the vote, which brought further worldwide condemnation.

== Impact on peace process ==


The settlements have been a source of tension between Israel and the U.S. Jimmy Carter regarded the settlements as illegal and tactically unwise. Ronald Reagan stated that they were legal but an obstacle to negotiations. In 1991, the U.S. delayed a subsidized loan to pressure Israel on the subject of settlement-building in the Jerusalem-Bethlehem corridor. In 2005, U.S. declared support for &quot;the retention by Israel of major Israeli population centers as an outcome of negotiations,&quot; reflecting the statement by George W. Bush that a permanent peace treaty would have to reflect &quot;demographic realities&quot; in the West Bank. In June 2009, Barack Obama said that the United States &quot;does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.&quot;

Palestinians claim that Israel has undermined the Oslo accords and peace process by continuing to expand the settlements. Settlements in the Sinai Peninsula were evacuated and razed in the wake of the peace agreement with Egypt. The 27 ministers of foreign affairs of the European Union published a report in May 2012 strongly denouncing policies of the State of Israel in the West Bank and finding that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and &quot;threaten to make a two-state solution impossible.&quot; In the framework of the Oslo I Accord of 1993 between the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a modus vivendi was reached whereby both parties agreed to postpone a final solution on the destination of the settlements to the permanent status negotiations (Article V.3). Israel claims that settlements thereby were not prohibited, since there is no explicit interim provision prohibiting continued settlement construction, the agreement does register an undertaking by both sides, namely that &quot;Neither side shall initiate or take any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent status negotiations&quot; (Article XXX1 (7)), which has been interpreted as, not forbidding settlements, but imposing severe restrictions on new settlement building after that date. Melanie Jacques argued in this context that even &#x27;agreements between Israel and the Palestinians which would allow settlements in the OPT, or simply tolerate them pending a settlement of the conflict, violate the Fourth Geneva Convention.&#x27;

Final status proposals have called for retaining long-established communities along the Green Line and transferring the same amount of land in Israel to the Palestinian state. The Clinton administration proposed that Israel keep some settlements in the West Bank, especially those in large blocs near the pre-1967 borders of Israel, with the Palestinians receiving concessions of land in other parts of the country. Both Clinton and Tony Blair pointed out the need for territorial and diplomatic compromise based on the validity of some of the claims of both sides.

As Minister of Defense, Ehud Barak approved a plan requiring security commitments in exchange for withdrawal from the West Bank. Barak also expressed readiness to cede parts of East Jerusalem and put the holy sites in the city under a &quot;special regime.&quot;

On 14 June 2009, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as an answer to U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s speech in Cairo, delivered a speech setting out his principles for a Palestinian-Israeli peace, among others, he alleged &quot;... we have no intention of building new settlements or of expropriating additional land for existing settlements.&quot; In March 2010, the Netanyahu government announced plans for building 1,600 housing units in Ramat Shlomo across the Green Line in East Jerusalem during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden&#x27;s visit to Israel causing a diplomatic row.

On 6 September 2010, Jordanian King Abdullah II and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said that Israel would need to withdraw from all of the lands occupied in 1967 in order to achieve peace with the Palestinians.

Bradley Burston has said that a negotiated or unilateral withdraw from most of the settlements in the West Bank is gaining traction in Israel.

In November 2010, the United States offered to &quot;fight against efforts to delegitimize Israel&quot; and provide extra arms to Israel in exchange for a continuation of the settlement freeze and a final peace agreement, but failed to come to an agreement with the Israelis on the exact terms.

In December 2010, the United States criticised efforts by the Palestinian Authority to impose borders for the two states through the United Nations rather than through direct negotiations between the two sides. In February 2011, it vetoed a draft resolution to condemn all Jewish settlements established in the occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 as illegal. The resolution, which was supported by all other Security Council members and co-sponsored by nearly 120 nations, would have demanded that &quot;Israel, as the occupying power, immediately and completely ceases all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem and that it fully respect its legal obligations in this regard.&quot; The U.S. representative said that while it agreed that the settlements were illegal, the resolution would harm chances for negotiations. Israel&#x27;s deputy Foreign Minister, Daniel Ayalon, said that the &quot;UN serves as a rubber stamp for the Arab countries and, as such, the General Assembly has an automatic majority,&quot; and that the vote &quot;proved that the United States is the only country capable of advancing the peace process and the only righteous one speaking the truth: that direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are required.&quot; Palestinian negotiators, however, have refused to resume direct talks until Israel ceases all settlement activity.

In November 2009, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu issued a 10-month settlement freeze in the West Bank in an attempt to restart negotiations with the Palestinians. The freeze did not apply to building in Jerusalem in areas across the green line, housing already under construction and existing construction described as &quot;essential for normal life in the settlements&quot; such as synagogues, schools, kindergartens and public buildings. The Palestinians refused to negotiate without a complete halt to construction. In the face of pressure from the United States and most world powers supporting the demand by the Palestinian Authority that Israel desist from settlement project in 2010, Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the UN Meron Reuben said Israel would only stop settlement construction after a peace agreement is concluded, and expressed concern were Arab countries to press for UN recognition of a Palestinian state before such an accord. He cited Israel&#x27;s dismantlement of settlements in both the Sinai which took place after a peace agreement, and its unilateral dismantlement of settlements in the Gaza Strip. He presumed that settlements would stop being built were Palestinians to establish a state in a given area.

=== Proposals for land swap ===
The Clinton Parameters, a 2000 peace proposal by then U.S. President Bill Clinton, included a plan on which the Palestinian State was to include 94–96% of the West Bank, and around 80% of the settlers were to be under Israeli sovereignty, and in exchange for that, Israel will concede some territory (so called &#x27;Territory Exchange&#x27; or &#x27;Land Swap&#x27;) within the Green Line (1967 borders). The swap would consist of 1–3% of Israeli territory, such that the final borders of the West Bank part of the Palestinian state would include 97% of the land of the original borders.

In 2010, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that the Palestinians and Israel have agreed on the principle of a land swap. The issue of the ratio of land Israel would give to the Palestinians in exchange for keeping settlement blocs is an issue of dispute, with the Palestinians demanding that the ratio be 1:1, and Israel insisting that other factors be considered as well.

Under any peace deal with the Palestinians, Israel intends to keep the major settlement blocs close to its borders, which contain over 80% of the settlers. Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin, Ariel Sharon, and Benjamin Netanyahu have all stated Israel&#x27;s intent to keep such blocs under any peace agreement. U.S. President George W. Bush acknowledged that such areas should be annexed to Israel in a 2004 letter to Prime Minister Sharon.

The European Union position is that any annexation of settlements should be done as part of mutually agreed land swaps, which would see the Palestinians controlling territory equivalent to the territory captured in 1967. The EU says that it will not recognise any changes to the 1967 borders without an agreement between the parties.

Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has proposed a plan which would see settlement blocs annexed to Israel in exchange for heavily Arab areas inside Israel as part of a population exchange.

According to Mitchell G. Bard: &quot;Ultimately, Israel may decide to unilaterally disengage from the West Bank and determine which settlements it will incorporate within the borders it delineates. Israel would prefer, however, to negotiate a peace treaty with the Palestinians that would specify which Jewish communities will remain intact within the mutually agreed border of Israel, and which will need to be evacuated. Israel will undoubtedly insist that some or all of the &quot;consensus&quot; blocs become part of Israel&quot;.

=== Proposal of dual citizenship ===
A number of proposals for the granting of Palestinian citizenship or residential permits to Jewish settlers in return for the removal of Israeli military installations from the West Bank have been fielded by such individuals as Arafat, Ibrahim Sarsur and Ahmed Qurei. In contrast, Mahmoud Abbas said in July 2013 that &quot;In a final resolution, we would not see the presence of a single Israeli—civilian or soldier—on our lands.&quot;

Israeli Minister Moshe Ya&#x27;alon said in April 2010 that &quot;&quot;just as Arabs live in Israel, so, too, should Jews be able to live in Palestine.&quot; ... &quot;If we are talking about coexistence and peace, why the [Palestinian] insistence that the territory they receive be ethnically cleansed of Jews?&quot;&quot;.

The idea has been expressed by both advocates of the two-state solution and supporters of the settlers and conservative or fundamentalist currents in Israeli Judaism that, while objecting to any withdrawal, claim stronger links to the land than to the State of Israel.

== Settlement expansion ==
===Pre Resolution 2334===
On 19 June 2011, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that the Israeli cabinet voted to revoke Defense Minister Ehud Barak&#x27;s authority to veto new settlement construction in the West Bank, by transferring this authority from the Agriculture Ministry, headed by Barak ally Orit Noked, to the Prime Minister&#x27;s office.

In 2009, newly elected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: &quot;I have no intention of building new settlements in the West Bank... But like all the governments there have been until now, I will have to meet the needs of natural growth in the population. I will not be able to choke the settlements.&quot; On 15 October 2009, he said the settlement row with the United States had been resolved.

In April 2012, four illegal outposts were retroactively legalized by the Israeli government. In June 2012, the Netanyahu government announced a plan to build 851 homes in five settlements: 300 units in Beit El and 551 units in other settlements.

Amid peace negotiations that showed little signs of progress, Israel issued on 3 November 2013, tenders for 1,700 new homes for Jewish settlers. The plots were offered in nine settlements in areas Israel says it intends to keep in any peace deal with the Palestinians. On 12 November, Peace Now revealed that the Construction and Housing Ministry had issued tenders for 24,000 more settler homes in the West Bank, including 4,000 in East Jerusalem. 2,500 units were planned in Ma&#x27;aleh Adumim, some 9,000 in the Gush Etzion Region, and circa 12,000 in the Binyamin Region, including 1,200 homes in the E1 area in addition to 3,000 homes in previously frozen E1 projects. Circa 15,000 homes of the 24,000 plan would be east of the West Bank Barrier and create the first new settlement blocs for two decades, and the first blocs ever outside the Barrier, far inside the West Bank.

As stated before, the Israeli government (as of 2015) has a program of residential subsidies in which Israeli settlers receive about double that given to Israelis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. As well, settlers in isolated areas receive three times the Israeli national average. From the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2013, the Israeli settlement population as a whole increased by a rate of over 4% per year. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 2015 stated that said building had been &quot;at the heart of mounting European criticism of Israel.&quot;

===Resolution 2334 and quarterly reports===
United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 &quot;Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council every three months on the implementation of the provisions of the present resolution;&quot;
In the first of these reports, delivered verbally at a security council meeting on 24 March 2017, United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nickolay Mladenov, noted that Resolution 2334 called on Israel to take steps to cease all settlement activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, that &quot;no such steps have been taken during the reporting period&quot; and that instead, there had been a marked increase in statements, announcements and decisions related to construction and expansion.

===Regularization and outpost method===

The 2017 Settlement Regularization in &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot; Law permits backdated legalization of outposts constructed on private Palestinian land. Following a petition challenging its legality, on June 9, 2020, Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court struck down the law that had retroactively legalized about 4,000 settler homes built on privately owned Palestinian land. The Israeli Attorney General has stated that existing laws already allow legalization of Israeli constructions on private Palestinian land in the West Bank. The Israeli Attorney General, Avichai Mandelblit, has updated the High Court on his official approval of the use of a legal tactic permitting the de facto legalization of roughly 2,000 illegally built Israeli homes throughout the West Bank. The legal mechanism is known as &quot;market regulation&quot; and relies on the notion that wildcat Israeli homes built on private Palestinian land were done so in good faith.

In a report of 22 July 2019, PeaceNow notes that after a gap of 6 years when there were no new outposts, establishment of new outposts recommenced in 2012, with 32 of the current 126 outposts set up to date. 2 outposts were subject to eviction, 15 were legalized and at least 35 are in process of legalization.

===Updates and related matters===
The Israeli government announced in 2019 that it has made monetary grants available for the construction of hotels in Area C of the West Bank.

According to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem expanded by 60% between 2017, when Donald Trump became US president, and 2019.

On 9 July 2021, Michael Lynk, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, addressing a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, said &quot;I conclude that the Israeli settlements do amount to a war crime,&quot; and &quot;I submit to you that this finding compels the international community...to make it clear to Israel that its illegal occupation, and its defiance of international law and international opinion, can and will no longer be cost-free.&quot; Israel, which does not recognize Lynk&#x27;s mandate, boycotted the session.

A new Israeli government, formed on 13 June 2021, declared a &quot;status quo&quot; in the settlements policy. According to Peace Now, as of 28 October this has not been the case. On October 24, 2021, tenders were published for 1,355 housing units plus another 83 in Givat HaMatos and on 27 October 2021, approval was given for 3,000 housing units including in settlements deep inside the West Bank. These developments were condemned by the U.S. as well as by the United Kingdom, Russia and 12 European countries. while UN experts, Michael Lynk, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 and Mr. Balakrishnan Rajagopal (United States of America), UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing said that settlement expansion should be treated as a &quot;presumptive war crime&quot;.

In February 2023, the new Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu approved the legalization of nine illegal settler outposts in the West Bank. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of most of the Civil Administration, obtaining broad authority over civilian issues in the West Bank. In March 2023, Netanyahu&#x27;s government repealed a 2005 law whereby four Israeli settlements, Homesh, Sa-Nur, Ganim and Kadim, were dismantled as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. In June 2023, Israel shortened the procedure of approving settlement construction and gave Finance Minister Smotrich the authority to approve one of the stages, changing the system operating for the last 27 years. In its first six months, construction of 13,000 housing units in settlements, almost triple the amount advanced in the whole of 2022.

<text>Irrealism is a term that has been used by various writers in the fields of philosophy, literature, and art to denote specific modes of unreality and/or the problems in concretely defining reality. While in philosophy the term specifically refers to a position put forward by the American philosopher Nelson Goodman, in literature and art it refers to a variety of writers and movements. If the term has nonetheless retained a certain consistency in its use across these fields and would-be movements, it perhaps reflects the word&#x27;s position in general English usage: though the standard dictionary definition of &quot;irreal&quot; gives it the same meaning as &quot;unreal&quot;, &quot;irreal&quot; is very rarely used in comparison with &quot;unreal&quot;. Thus, it has generally been used to describe something which, while unreal, is so in a very specific or unusual fashion, usually one emphasizing not just the &quot;not real,&quot; but some form of estrangement from our generally accepted sense of reality.

==Irrealism in literature==

In literature, the term irrealism was first used extensively in the United States in the 1970s to describe the post-realist &quot;new fiction&quot; of writers such as Donald Barthelme or John Barth. More generally, it described the notion that all forms of writing could only &quot;offer particular versions of reality rather than actual descriptions of it,&quot; and that a story need not offer a clear resolution at its end. John Gardner, in &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot;, cites in this context the work of Barthelme and its &quot;seemingly limitless ability to manipulate [literary] techniques as modes of apprehension [which] apprehend nothing.&quot; Though Barth, in a 1974 interview, stated, &quot;irrealism—not antirealism or unrealism, but irrealism—is all that I would confidently predict is likely to characterize the prose fiction of the 1970s,&quot; this did not prove to be the case. Instead writing in the United States quickly returned to its realist orthodoxy and the term irrealism fell into disuse.

In recent years, however, the term has been revived in an attempt to describe and categorize, in literary and philosophical terms, how it is that the work of an irrealist writer differs from the work of writers in other, non-realistic genres (e.g., the fantasy of J.R.R. Tolkien, the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez) and what the significance of this difference is. This can be seen in Dean Swinford&#x27;s essay &quot;Defining irrealism: scientific development and allegorical possibility&quot;. Approaching the issue from a structuralist and narratological point of view, he has defined irrealism as a &quot;peculiar mode of postmodern allegory&quot; that has resulted from modernity&#x27;s fragmentation and dismantling of the well-ordered and coherent medieval system of symbol and allegory. Thus a lion, when presented in a given context in medieval literature, could only be interpreted in a single, approved way. Contemporary literary theory, however, denies the attribution of such fixed meanings. According to Swinford, this change can be attributed in part to the fact that &quot;science and technical culture have changed perceptions of the natural world, have significantly changed the natural world itself, thereby altering the vocabulary of symbols applicable to epistemological and allegorical attempts to understand it.&quot; Thus irreal works such as Italo Calvino&#x27;s &quot;Cosmicomics&quot; and Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; &quot;Ficciones&quot; can be seen as an attempt to find a new allegorical language to explain our changed perceptions of the world that have been brought about by our scientific and technical culture, especially concepts such as quantum physics or the theory of relativity. &quot;The Irrealist work, then, operates within a given system,&quot; writes Swinford, &quot;and attests to its plausibility, despite the fact that this system, and the world it represents, is often a mutation, an aberration.&quot;

The online journal &quot;The Cafe Irreal&quot; , on the other hand, has defined irrealism as being a type of existentialist literature in which the means are continually and absurdly rebelling against the ends that we have determined for them. An example of this would be Franz Kafka&#x27;s story &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, in which the salesman Gregor Samsa&#x27;s plans for supporting his family and rising up in rank by hard work and determination are suddenly thrown topsy-turvy by his sudden and inexplicable transformation into a man-sized insect. Such fiction is said to emphasize the fact that human consciousness, being finite in nature, can never make complete sense of, or successfully order, a universe that is infinite in its aspects and possibilities. Which is to say: as much as we might try to order our world with a certain set of norms and goals (which we consider our real world), the paradox of a finite consciousness in an infinite universe creates a zone of irreality (&quot;that which is beyond the real&quot;) that offsets, opposes, or threatens the real world of the human subject. Irrealist writing often highlights this irreality, and our strange fascination with it, by combining the unease we feel because the real world doesn&#x27;t conform to our desires with the narrative quality of the dream state (where reality is constantly and inexplicably being undermined); it is thus said to communicate directly, &quot;by feeling rather than articulation, the uncertainties inherent in human existence or, to put it another way... the irreconcilability between human aspiration and human reality.&quot; If the irreal story can be considered an allegory, then, it would be an allegory that is &quot;so many pointers to an unknown meaning,&quot; in which the meaning is felt more than it is articulated or systematically analyzed.

==Irrealism in art==

Various writers have addressed the question of Irrealism in Art. Many salient observations on Irrealism in Art are found in Nelson Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Languages of Art&quot;. Goodman himself produced some multimedia shows, one of which inspired by hockey and is entitled &quot;Hockey Seen: A Nightmare in Three Periods and Sudden Death&quot;.

Garret Rowlan, writing in &quot;The Cafe Irreal&quot;, writes that the malaise present in the work of the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, &quot;which recalls Kafka, has to do with the sense of another world lurking, hovering like the long shadows that dominate de Chirico&#x27;s paintings, which frequently depict a landscape at twilight&#x27;s uncertain hour. Malaise and mystery are all by-products of the interaction of the real and the unreal, the rub and contact of two worlds caught on irrealism&#x27;s shimmering surface.&quot; 

The writer Dean Swinford, whose concept of irrealism was described at length in the section &quot;Irrealism in Literature&quot;, wrote that the artist Remedios Varos, in her painting &quot;The Juggler&quot;, &quot;creates a personal allegorical system which relies on the predetermined symbols of Christian and classical iconography. But these are quickly refigured into a personal system informed by the scientific and organized like a machine...in the Irreal work, allegory operates according to an altered, but constant and orderly iconographic system.&quot;

Artist Tristan Tondino claims &quot;There is no specific style to Irrealist Art. It is the result of awareness that every human act is the result of the limitations of the world of the actor.&quot;

In Australia, the art journal &quot;the art life&quot; has recently detected the presence of a &quot;New Irrealism&quot; among the painters of that country, which is described as being an &quot;approach to painting that is decidedly low key, deploying its effects without histrionic showmanship, while creating an eerie other world of ghostly images and abstract washes.&quot; What exactly constituted the &quot;old&quot; irrealism, they do not say.

== Irrealist Art, Film and Music Edition ==

Irrealist Art Edition is a publishing company created in the 90s by contemporary plastic artist Frédéric Iriarte. Together with the Estonian poet, writer and art critic Ilmar Laaban, they developed their concept of Irrealism through several essays, exhibitions, projects, manifest and a book, &quot;Irréalisation&quot;.

<doc id="15129" wikidata="Q2073177" url="?curid=15129" title="You have two cows">
<text>&quot;You have two cows&quot; is a political analogy and form of early 20th century American political satire to describe various economic systems of government. The setup of a typical joke of this kind is the assumption that the listener lives within a given system and has two cows, a very relatable occupation across countries and national boundaries. The punch line is what happens to the listener and the cows in the system; it offers a brief and humorous take on the subject or locale.

A newer variant of the joke cycle compares different peoples and countries.

==History==

An article in &quot;The Modern Language Journal&quot; lists the following classical ones:
*&quot;Socialism&quot;: If you have two cows, the Government takes one and gives it to your neighbor.
*&quot;Communism&quot;: If you have two cows, Government takes both and then gives you some milk.
*&quot;Fascism&quot;: If you have two cows, you keep the cows and give the milk to the Government; then the government sells you some milk.
*&quot;New Dealism&quot;: If you have two cows, you shoot one and milk the other; then you pour the milk down the drain.
*&quot;Nazism&quot;: If you have two cows, the Government shoots you and keeps the cows.
*&quot;Capitalism&quot;: If you have two cows, you sell one and buy a bull.

Bill Sherk mentions that such lists circulated throughout the United States since around 1936 under the title &quot;Parable of the Isms&quot;. A column in &quot;The Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; in 1938 attributes a version involving socialism, communism, fascism and New Dealism to an address by Silas Strawn to the Economic Club of Chicago on 29 November 1935.

Richard M Steers and Luciara Nardon in their book about global economy use the &quot;two cows&quot; metaphor to illustrate the concept of cultural differences. They write that jokes of the kind are considered funny because they are &quot;realistic but exaggerated caricatures&quot; of various cultures, and the pervasiveness of such jokes stems from the significant cultural differences. Steers and Nardon also state that others believe such jokes present cultural stereotypes and must be viewed with caution.

==Notable variants==
Jokes of this genre formed the base of a monologue by American comedian Pat Paulsen on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in the late 1960s. Satirising the satire, he appended this comment to capitalism: &quot;...Then put both of them in your wife&#x27;s name and declare bankruptcy.&quot; This material was later used as an element of his satirical US presidential campaign in 1968, and was included on his 1968 comedy album &quot;Pat Paulsen for President&quot;.

=== Enron scandal ===
The economics of the Enron scandal have been a target of the &quot;two cows&quot; joke, often describing the accounting fraud that took place in Enron&#x27;s finances. Much of the beginning of the joke when used to describe Enron resembles the following:

The ending of the joke varies in most interactions. The magazine &quot;Wired&quot; in 2008 ended the joke with Enron selling one cow to buy a new president of the United States, that no balance sheet was provided with the annual report, and ultimately the public buying Enron&#x27;s bull. In 2002, Power Engineering ended the joke by announcing Enron would start trading cows online using the platform COW (cows on web).

<text>A lightbulb joke is a joke cycle that asks how many people of a certain group are needed to change, replace, or screw in a light bulb. Generally, the punch line answer highlights a stereotype of the target group. There are numerous versions of the lightbulb joke satirizing a wide range of cultures, beliefs, and occupations.

Early versions of the joke, popular in the late 1960s and the 1970s, were used to insult the intelligence of people, especially Poles (&quot;Polish jokes&quot;). Such jokes generally take the form of:
Although lightbulb jokes tend to be derogatory in tone (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;How many drunkards...&quot; / &quot;Four: one to hold the light bulb and three to drink until the room spins&quot;), the people targeted by them may take pride in the stereotypes expressed and are often themselves the jokes&#x27; originators. An example where the joke itself becomes a statement of ethnic pride is:
Lightbulb jokes applied to subgroups can be used to ease tensions between them.

== Variations ==

Some versions of the joke are puns on the words &quot;change&quot; or &quot;screw&quot;, or &quot;light&quot;:



Lightbulb jokes are often responses to contemporary events.
For example, the lightbulb may not need to be changed at all due to ongoing power outages.

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; held a $200 lightbulb joke contest around the time of the Iran hostage crisis, with the winning joke being:

Lightbulb jokes can also be about sports, teasing about their team&#x27;s past, future, etc.

Lightbulb jokes can also be related to religious groups and denominations.

<doc id="15144" wikidata="Q193858" url="?curid=15144" title="International Electrotechnical Commission">
<text>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC; ) is an international standards organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies. IEC standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation, transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment, semiconductors, fibre optics, batteries, solar energy, nanotechnology, and marine energy, as well as many others. The IEC also manages four global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment, system or components conform to its international standards.

All electrotechnologies are covered by IEC Standards, including energy production and distribution, electronics, magnetics and electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia, telecommunications and medical technology, as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility, measurement and performance, dependability, design and development, safety and the environment.

==History==
The first International Electrical Congress took place in 1881 at the International Exposition of Electricity, held in Paris. At that time the International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units was agreed to.

The International Electrotechnical Commission held its inaugural meeting on 26 June 1906, following discussions among the British Institution of Electrical Engineers, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and others, which began at the 1900 Paris International Electrical Congress, with British engineer R. E. B. Crompton playing a key role. In 1906, Lord Kelvin was elected as the first President of the International Electrotechnical Commission.

The IEC was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement, particularly the gauss, hertz, and weber. It was also first to promote the Giorgi System of standards, later developed into the SI, or &quot;Système International d&#x27;unités&quot; (in English, the International System of Units).

In 1938, it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical, electronic and related technologies. This effort continues, and the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary is published online as the &quot;Electropedia&quot;.

The CISPR (&quot;Comité International Spécial des Perturbations Radioélectriques&quot;) – in English, the International Special Committee on Radio Interference – is one of the groups founded by the IEC.

Currently, 89 countries are IEC members while another 85 participate in the Affiliate Country Programme, which is not a form of membership but is designed to help industrializing countries get involved with the IEC. Originally located in London, United Kingdom, the IEC moved to its current headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland in 1948.

It has regional centres in Africa (Nairobi, Kenya), Asia (Singapore), Oceania (Sydney, Australia), Latin America (São Paulo, Brazil) and North America (Worcester, Massachusetts, United States).

The work is done by some 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry, government, academia, test labs and others with an interest in the subject.

IEC Standards are often adopted as national standards by its members.

==IEC Standards==
The IEC cooperates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, it works with several major standards development organizations, including the IEEE with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2002, which was amended in 2008 to include joint development work.

IEC Standards that are not jointly developed with ISO have numbers in the range 60000–79999 and their titles take a form such as &quot;IEC 60417: Graphical symbols for use on equipment&quot;. Following the Dresden Agreement with CENELEC the numbers of older IEC standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000, for example IEC 27 became IEC 60027. Standards of the 60000 series are also found preceded by EN to indicate that the IEC standard is also adopted by CENELEC as a European standard; for example IEC 60034 is also available as EN 60034.

Standards developed jointly with ISO, such as ISO/IEC 26300 (&quot;Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0&quot;), ISO/IEC 27001 (&quot;Information technology, Security techniques, Information security management systems, Requirements&quot;), and ISO/IEC 17000 series, carry the acronym of both organizations. The use of the ISO/IEC prefix covers publications from ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 – &quot;Information Technology&quot;, as well as conformity assessment standards developed by ISO CASCO (Committee on conformity assessment) and IEC CAB (Conformity Assessment Board). Other standards developed in cooperation between IEC and ISO are assigned numbers in the 80000 series, such as IEC 82045–1.

IEC Standards are also being adopted by other certifying bodies such as BSI (United Kingdom), CSA (Canada), UL &amp; ANSI/INCITS (United States), SABS (South Africa), Standards Australia, SPC/GB (China) and DIN (Germany). IEC standards adopted by other certifying bodies may have some noted differences from the original IEC standard.

==Membership and participation==
The IEC is made up of members, called national committees, and each NC represents its nation&#x27;s electrotechnical interests in the IEC. This includes manufacturers, providers, distributors and vendors, consumers and users, all levels of governmental agencies, professional societies and trade associations as well as standards developers from national standards bodies. National committees are constituted in different ways. Some NCs are public sector only, some are a combination of public and private sector, and some are private sector only. About 90% of those who prepare IEC standards work in industry. IEC Member countries include:

===Affiliates===
In 2001 and in response to calls from the WTO to open itself to more developing nations, the IEC launched the Affiliate Country Programme to encourage developing nations to become involved in the commission&#x27;s work or to use its International Standards. Countries signing a pledge to participate in the work and to encourage the use of IEC Standards in national standards and regulations are granted access to a limited number of technical committee documents for the purposes of commenting. In addition, they can select a limited number of IEC Standards for their national standards&#x27; library. Countries participating in the Affiliate Country Programme are:

* Afghanistan
* Angola
* Antigua and Barbuda

<text>ISO 9660 (also known as [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-119) is a file system for optical disc media. The file system is an international standard available from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Since the specification is available for anybody to purchase, implementations have been written for many operating systems.

ISO 9660 traces its roots to the &quot;High Sierra Format&quot;, which arranged file information in a dense, sequential layout to minimize nonsequential access by using a hierarchical (eight levels of directories deep) tree file system arrangement, similar to Unix file systems and FAT. To facilitate cross platform compatibility, it defined a minimal set of common file attributes (directory or ordinary file and time of recording) and name attributes (name, extension, and version), and used a separate system use area where future optional extensions for each file may be specified. High Sierra was adopted in December 1986 (with changes) as an international standard by Ecma International as ECMA-119 and submitted for fast tracking to the ISO, where it was eventually accepted as ISO 9660:1988. Subsequent amendments to the standard were published in 2013 and 2020.

The first 16 sectors of the file system are empty and reserved for other uses. The rest begins with a &quot;volume descriptor set&quot; (a header block which describes the subsequent layout) and then the path tables, directories and files on the disc. An ISO 9660 compliant disc must contain at least one &quot;primary volume descriptor&quot; describing the file system and a &quot;volume descriptor set terminator&quot; which is a volume descriptor that marks the end of the descriptor set. The primary volume descriptor provides information about the volume, characteristics and metadata, including a root directory record that indicates in which sector the root directory is located. Other fields contain metadata such as the volume&#x27;s name and creator, along with the size and number of logical blocks used by the file system. Path tables summarize the directory structure of the relevant directory hierarchy. For each directory in the image, the path table provides the directory identifier, the location of the extent in which the directory is recorded, the length of any extended attributes associated with the directory, and the index of its parent directory path table entry.

There are several extensions to ISO 9660 that relax some of its limitations. Notable examples include &quot;Rock Ridge&quot; (Unix-style permissions and longer names), &quot;Joliet&quot; (Unicode, allowing non-Latin scripts to be used), &quot;El Torito&quot; (enables CDs to be bootable) and the &quot;Apple ISO 9660 Extensions&quot; (file characteristics specific to the classic Mac OS and macOS, such as resource forks, file backup date and more).

== History ==

Compact discs were originally developed for recording musical data, but soon were used for storing additional digital data types because they were equally effective for archival mass data storage. Called CD-ROMs, the lowest level format for these type of compact discs was defined in the &quot;Yellow Book&quot; specification in 1983. However, this book did not define any format for organizing data on CD-ROMs into logical units such as files, which led to every CD-ROM maker creating its own format. In order to develop a CD-ROM file system standard (&quot;Z39.60&quot; - &quot;Volume and File Structure of CDROM for Information Interchange&quot;), the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) set up Standards Committee SC EE (Compact Disc Data Format) in July 1985. In September/ October 1985 several companies invited experts to participate in the development of a working paper for such a standard.

In November 1985, representatives of computer hardware manufacturers gathered at the High Sierra Hotel and Casino (currently called the Golden Nugget Lake Tahoe) in Stateline, Nevada. This group became known as the &quot;High Sierra Group&quot; (&quot;HSG&quot;). Present at the meeting were representatives from Apple Computer, AT&amp;T, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Hitachi, LaserData, Microware, Microsoft, 3M, Philips, Reference Technology Inc., Sony Corporation, TMS Inc., VideoTools (later Meridian), Xebec, and Yelick. The meeting report evolved from the &quot;Yellow Book&quot; CD-ROM standard, which was so open ended it was leading to diversification and creation of many incompatible data storage methods. The &quot;High Sierra Group Proposal&quot; (&quot;HSGP&quot;) was released in May 1986, defining a file system for CD-ROMs commonly known as the High Sierra Format.

A draft version of this proposal was submitted to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) for standardization. With some changes, this led to the issue of the initial edition of the ECMA-119 standard in December 1986. The ECMA submitted their standard to the International Standards Organization (ISO) for &quot;fast tracking&quot;, where it was further refined into the ISO 9660 standard. For compatibility the second edition of ECMA-119 was revised to be equivalent to ISO 9660 in December 1987. &quot;ISO 9660:1988&quot; was published in 1988. The main changes from the High Sierra Format in the ECMA-119 and ISO 9660 standards were international extensions to allow the format to work better on non-US markets.

In order not to create incompatibilities, NISO suspended further work on Z39.60, which had been adopted by NISO members on 28 May 1987. It was withdrawn before final approval, in favour of ISO 9660.

JIS X 0606:1998 was passed in Japan in 1998 with much-relaxed file name rules using a new &quot;enhanced volume descriptor&quot; data structure. The standard was submitted for ISO 9660:1999 and supposedly fast-tracked, but nothing came out of it. Nevertheless, several operating systems and disc authoring tools (such as Nero Burning ROM, mkisofs and ImgBurn) now support the addition, under such names as &quot;ISO 9660:1999&quot;, &quot;ISO 9660 v2&quot;, or &quot;ISO 9660 Level 4&quot;. In 2013, the proposal was finally formalized in the form of ISO 9660/Amendment 1, intended to &quot;bring harmonization between ISO 9660 and widely used &#x27;Joliet Specification&#x27;.&quot; In December 2017, a 3rd Edition of ECMA-119 was published that is technically identical with ISO 9660, Amendment 1.

In 2019, ECMA published a 4th version of ECMA-119, integrating the Joliet text as &quot;Annex C&quot;.

In 2020, ISO published Amendment 2, which adds some minor clarifying matter, but does not add or correct any technical information of the standard.

== Specifications ==

The following is the rough overall structure of the ISO 9660 file system.

Multi-byte values can be stored in three different formats: little-endian, big-endian, and in a concatenation of both types in what the specification calls &quot;both-byte&quot; order. Both-byte order is required in several fields in the volume descriptors and directory records, while path tables can be either little-endian or big-endian.

=== Top level ===

The &quot;system area&quot;, the first 32,768 data bytes of the disc (16 sectors of 2,048 bytes each), is unused by ISO 9660 and therefore available for other uses. While it is suggested that they are reserved for use by bootable media, a CD-ROM may contain an alternative file system descriptor in this area, and it is often used by hybrid CDs to offer classic Mac OS-specific and macOS-specific content.

=== Volume descriptor set ===

The &quot;data area&quot; begins with the &quot;volume descriptor set&quot;, a set of one or more &quot;volume descriptors&quot; terminated with a &quot;volume descriptor set terminator&quot;. These collectively act as a header for the data area, describing its content (similar to the BIOS parameter block used by FAT, HPFS and NTFS formatted disks).

Each volume descriptor is 2048 bytes in size, fitting perfectly into a single Mode 1 or Mode 2 Form 1 sector. They have the following structure:

The data field of a volume descriptor may be subdivided into several fields, with the exact content depending on the type. Redundant copies of each volume descriptor can also be included in case the first copy of the descriptor becomes corrupt.

Standard volume descriptor types are the following:

An ISO 9660 compliant disc must contain at least one &quot;primary volume descriptor&quot; describing the file system and a &quot;volume descriptor set terminator&quot; for indicating the end of the descriptor sequence. The &quot;volume descriptor set terminator&quot; is simply a particular type of volume descriptor with the purpose of marking the end of this set of structures. The primary volume descriptor provides information about the volume, characteristics and metadata, including a root directory record that indicates in which sector the root directory is located. Other fields contain the description or name of the volume, and information about who created it and with which application. The size of the logical blocks which the file system uses to segment the volume is also stored in a field inside the primary volume descriptor, as well as the amount of space occupied by the volume (measured in number of logical blocks).

In addition to the primary volume descriptor(s), &quot;supplementary volume descriptors&quot; or &quot;enhanced volume descriptors&quot; may be present.
* Supplementary volume descriptors describe the same volume as the primary volume descriptor does, and are normally used for providing additional code page support when the standard code tables are insufficient. The standard specifies that ISO 2022 is used for managing code sets that are wider than 8 bytes, and that ISO 2375 escape sequences are used to identify each particular code page used. Consequently, ISO 9660 supports international single-byte and multi-byte character sets, provided they fit into the framework of the referenced standards. However, ISO 9660 does not specify any code pages that are guaranteed to be supported: all use of code tables other than those defined in the standard itself are subject to agreement between the originator and the recipient of the volume.
* Enhanced volume descriptors were introduced in ISO 9660, Amendment 1. They relax some of the requirements of the other volume descriptors and the directory records referenced by them: for example, the directory depth can exceed eight, file identifiers need not contain &#x27;.&#x27; or file version number, the length of a file and directory identifier is maximized to 207.

=== Path tables ===

Path tables summarize the directory structure of the relevant directory hierarchy. For each directory in the image, the path table provides the directory identifier, the location of the extent in which the directory is recorded, the length of any extended attributes associated with the directory, and the index of its parent directory path table entry. The parent directory number is a 16-bit number, limiting its range from 1 to 65,535.

=== Directories and files ===
Directory entries are stored following the location of the root directory entry, where evaluation of filenames is begun. Both directories and files are stored as extents, which are sequential series of sectors. Files and directories are differentiated only by a file attribute that indicates its nature (similar to Unix). The attributes of a file are stored in the directory entry that describes the file, and optionally in the extended attribute record. To locate a file, the directory names in the file&#x27;s path can be checked sequentially, going to the location of each directory to obtain the location of the subsequent subdirectory. However, a file can also be located through the path table provided by the file system. This path table stores information about each directory, its parent, and its location on disc. Since the path table is stored in a contiguous region, it can be searched much faster than jumping to the particular locations of each directory in the file&#x27;s path, thus reducing seek time.

The standard specifies three nested levels of interchange (paraphrased from section 10):

* Level 1: File names are limited to eight characters with a three-character extension. Directory names are limited to eight characters. Files may contain one single file section.
* Level 2: File Name + &#x27;.&#x27; + File Name extension or Directory Name may not exceed 31 characters in length (sections 7.5 and 7.6). Files may contain one single file section.
* Level 3: No additional restrictions than those stipulated in the main body of the standard. Files are also allowed to consist of multiple non-contiguous sections (with some restrictions as to order).

Additional restrictions in the body of the standard: The depth of the directory hierarchy must not exceed 8 (root directory being at level 1), and the path length of any file must not exceed 255. (section 6.8.2.1).

The standard also specifies the following name restrictions (sections 7.5 and 7.6):

* All levels restrict file names in the mandatory file hierarchy to upper case letters, digits, underscores (&quot;_&quot;), and a dot. (See also section 7.4.4 and Annex A.)
* If no characters are specified for the File Name then the File Name Extension shall consist of at least one character.
* If no characters are specified for the File Name Extension then the File Name shall consist of at least one character.
* File names shall not have more than one dot.
* Directory names shall not use dots at all.

A CD-ROM producer may choose one of the lower Levels of Interchange specified in chapter 10 of the standard, and further restrict file name length from 30 characters to only 8+3 in file identifiers, and 8 in directory identifiers in order to promote interchangeability with implementations that do not implement the full standard.

All numbers in ISO 9660 file systems except the single byte value used for the GMT offset are unsigned numbers. As the length of a file&#x27;s extent on disc is stored in a 32 bit value, it allows for a maximum length of just over 4.2 GB (more precisely, one byte less than 4 GiB). It is possible to circumvent this limitation by using the multi-extent (fragmentation) feature of ISO 9660 Level 3 to create ISO 9660 file systems and single files up to 8 TB. With this, files larger than 4 GiB can be split up into multiple extents (sequential series of sectors), each not exceeding the 4 GiB limit. For example, the free software such as InfraRecorder, ImgBurn and mkisofs as well as Roxio Toast are able to create ISO 9660 file systems that use multi-extent files to store files larger than 4 GiB on appropriate media such as recordable DVDs. Linux supports multiple extents.

Since amendment 1 (or ECMA-119 3rd edition, or &quot;JIS X 0606:1998 / ISO 9660:1999&quot;), a much wider variety of file trees can be expressed by the EVD system. There is no longer any character limit (even 8-bit characters are allowed), nor any depth limit or path length limit. There still is a limit on name length, at 207. The character set is no longer enforced, so both sides of the disc interchange need to agree via a different channel.

== Extensions and improvements ==

There are several extensions to ISO 9660 that relax some of its limitations. Notable examples include &quot;Rock Ridge&quot; (Unix-style permissions and longer names), &quot;Joliet&quot; (Unicode, allowing non-Latin scripts to be used), &quot;El Torito&quot; (enables CDs to be bootable) and the &quot;Apple ISO 9660 Extensions&quot; (file characteristics specific to the classic Mac OS and macOS, such as resource forks, file backup date and more).

=== SUSP ===

&quot;System Use Sharing Protocol&quot; (SUSP, IEEE P1281) provides a generic way of including additional properties for any directory entry reachable from the primary volume descriptor (PVD). In an ISO 9660 volume, every directory entry has an optional &quot;system use area&quot; whose contents are undefined and left to be interpreted by the system. SUSP defines a method to subdivide that area into multiple system use fields, each identified by a two-character signature tag. The idea behind SUSP was that it would enable any number of independent extensions to ISO 9660 to be created and included on a volume without conflicting. It also allows for the inclusion of property data that would otherwise be too large to fit within the limits of the system use area.

SUSP defines several common tags and system use fields:

* codice_1: Continuation area
* codice_2: Padding field
* codice_3: System use sharing protocol indicator
* codice_4: System use sharing protocol terminator
* codice_5: Extensions reference
* codice_6: Extension selector

Other known SUSP fields include:

* codice_7: Apple extension, preferred
* codice_8: Apple extension, old (length attribute is missing)
* codice_9: Amiga file properties
* codice_10: zisofs compressed file, usually produced by program mkzftree or by libisofs. Transparently decompressed by Linux kernel if built with CONFIG_ZISOFS.
* codice_11: records Extended File Attributes, including ACLs. Proposed by libburnia, supported by libisofs.

The Apple extensions do not technically follow the SUSP standard; however the basic structure of the AA and AB fields defined by Apple are forward compatible with SUSP; so that, with care, a volume can use both Apple extensions as well as RRIP extensions.

=== Rock Ridge ===

The &quot;Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol&quot; (RRIP, IEEE P1282) is an extension which adds POSIX file system semantics. The availability of these extension properties allows for better integration with Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The standard takes its name from the fictional town &quot;Rock Ridge&quot; in Mel Brooks&#x27; film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. The RRIP extensions are, briefly:

* Longer file names (up to 255 bytes) and fewer restrictions on allowed characters (support for lowercase, etc.)
* UNIX-style file modes, user ids and group ids, and file timestamps
* Support for Symbolic links and device files
* Deeper directory hierarchy (more than 8 levels)
* Efficient storage of sparse files

The RRIP extensions are built upon SUSP, defining additional tags for support of POSIX semantics, along with the format and meaning of the corresponding system use fields:

* codice_12: Rock Ridge extensions in-use indicator (note: dropped from standard after version 1.09)
* codice_13: POSIX file attributes
* codice_14: POSIX device numbers
* codice_15: symbolic link
* codice_16: alternate name
* codice_17: child link
* codice_18: parent link
* codice_19: relocated directory
* codice_20: time stamp
* codice_21: sparse file data

&quot;Amiga Rock Ridge&quot; is similar to RRIP, except it provides additional properties used by AmigaOS. It too is built on the SUSP standard by defining an &quot;AS&quot;-tagged system use field. Thus both Amiga Rock Ridge and the POSIX RRIP may be used simultaneously on the same volume. Some of the specific properties supported by this extension are the additional Amiga-bits for files. There is support for attribute &quot;P&quot; that stands for &quot;pure&quot; bit (indicating re-entrant command) and attribute &quot;S&quot; for script bit (indicating batch file). This includes the protection flags plus an optional comment field. These extensions were introduced by Angela Schmidt with the help of Andrew Young, the primary author of the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol and System Use Sharing Protocol. The first publicly available software to master a CD-ROM with Amiga extensions was MakeCD, an Amiga software which Angela Schmidt developed together with Patrick Ohly.

=== El Torito ===
&quot;El Torito&quot; is an extension designed to allow booting a computer from a CD-ROM. It was announced in November 1994 and first issued in January 1995 as a joint proposal by IBM and BIOS manufacturer Phoenix Technologies. According to legend, the El Torito CD/DVD extension to ISO 9660 got its name because its design originated in an El Torito restaurant in Irvine, California (). The initial two authors were Curtis Stevens, of Phoenix Technologies, and Stan Merkin, of IBM.

A 32-bit PC BIOS will search for boot code on an ISO 9660 CD-ROM. The standard allows for booting in two different modes. Either in hard disk emulation when the boot information can be accessed directly from the CD media, or in floppy emulation mode where the boot information is stored in an image file of a floppy disk, which is loaded from the CD and then behaves as a virtual floppy disk. This is useful for computers that were designed to boot only from a floppy drive. For modern computers the &quot;no emulation&quot; mode is generally the more reliable method. The BIOS will assign a BIOS drive number to the CD drive. The drive number (for INT 13H) assigned is any of 80hex (hard disk emulation), 00hex (floppy disk emulation) or an arbitrary number if the BIOS should not provide emulation. Emulation is useful for booting older operating systems from a CD, by making it appear to them as if they were booted from a hard or floppy disk.

UEFI systems also accept El Torito records, as platform 0xEF. The record is expected to be a disk image containing a FAT filesystem, the filesystem being an EFI System Partition containing the usual directory. The image should be marked for &quot;no emulation&quot;, though it does not actually work like the BIOS &quot;no emulation&quot; mode, in which the BIOS would load the image in memory and execute the code from there.

El Torito can also be used to produce CDs which can boot up Linux operating systems, by including the GRUB bootloader on the CD and following the Multiboot Specification. While the El Torito spec alludes to a &quot;Mac&quot; platform ID, PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh computers don&#x27;t use it.

=== Joliet ===

&quot;Joliet&quot; is an extension specified and endorsed by Microsoft and has been supported by all versions of its Windows operating system since Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. Its primary focus is the relaxation of the filename restrictions inherent with full ISO 9660 compliance. Joliet accomplishes this by supplying an additional set of filenames that are encoded in UCS-2BE (UTF-16BE in practice since Windows 2000). These filenames are stored in a special supplementary volume descriptor, that is safely ignored by ISO 9660-compliant software, thus preserving backward compatibility. The specification only allows filenames to be up to 64 Unicode characters in length. However, the documentation for mkisofs states filenames up to 103 characters in length do not appear to cause problems. Microsoft has documented it &quot;can use up to 110 characters.&quot; The difference lies in whether CDXA extension space is used.

Joliet allows Unicode characters to be used for all text fields, which includes file names and the volume name. A &quot;Secondary&quot; volume descriptor with type 2 contains the same information as the Primary one (sector 16 offset 40 bytes), but in UCS-2BE in sector 17, offset 40 bytes. As a result of this, the volume name is limited to 16 characters.

Many current PC operating systems are able to read Joliet-formatted media, thus allowing exchange of files between those operating systems even if non-Roman characters are involved (such as Arabic, Japanese or Cyrillic), which was formerly not possible with plain ISO 9660-formatted media. Operating systems which can read Joliet media include:

* Microsoft Windows; Microsoft recommends the use of the Joliet extension for developers targeting Windows.
* Linux
* macOS
* FreeBSD
* OpenSolaris
* Haiku
* AmigaOS
* RISC OS

=== Romeo ===

&quot;Romeo&quot; was developed by Adaptec and allows the use of long filenames up to 128 characters, written directly into the primary volume descriptor using the current code page. This format is built around the workings of Windows 9x and Windows NT &quot;CDFS&quot; drivers. When a Windows installation of a different language opens a &quot;Romeo&quot; disk, the lack of code page indication will cause non-ASCII characters in file names to become Mojibake. For example, &quot;ü&quot; may become &quot;³&quot;. A different OS may encounter a similar problem or refuse to recognize these noncompliant names outright.

The same code page problem technically exists in standard ISO 9660, which allows open interpretation of the supplemental and enhanced volume descriptors to any character encoding subject to agreement. However, the primary volume descriptor is guaranteed to be a small subset of ASCII.

=== Apple extensions ===

Apple Computer authored a set of extensions that add ProDOS or HFS/HFS+ (the primary contemporary file systems for the classic Mac OS) properties to the filesystem. Some of the additional metadata properties include:
* Date of last backup
* File type
* Creator code
* Flags and data for display
* Reference to a resource fork

In order to allow non-Macintosh systems to access Macintosh files on CD-ROMs, Apple chose to use an extension of the standard ISO 9660 format. Most of the data, other than the Apple specific metadata, remains visible to operating systems that are able to read ISO 9660.

=== Other extensions ===

For operating systems which do not support any extensions, a name translation file codice_22 must be used. The codice_22 file is a plain ASCII text file. Each line contains three fields, separated by an arbitrary amount of whitespace:

* The file type (&quot;F&quot; for file or &quot;D&quot; for directory);
* The ISO 9660 filename (including the usually hidden &quot;;1&quot; for files); and
* The extended filename, which may contain spaces.
Most implementations that create TRANS.TBL files put a single space between the file type and ISO 9660 name and some arbitrary number of tabs between the ISO 9660 filename and the extended filename.

Native support for using codice_22 still exists in many ISO 9660 implementations, particularly those related to Unix. However, it has long since been superseded by other extensions, and modern utilities that create ISO 9660 images either cannot create TRANS.TBL files at all, or no longer create them unless explicitly requested by the user. Since a TRANS.TBL file has no special identification other than its name, it can also be created separately and included in the directory before filesystem creation.

The ISO 13490 standard is an extension to the ISO 9660 format that adds support for multiple sessions on a disc. Since ISO 9660 is by design a read-only, pre-mastered file system, all the data has to be written in one go or &quot;session&quot; to the medium. Once written, there is no provision for altering the stored content. ISO 13490 was created to allow adding more files to a writeable disc such as CD-R in multiple sessions.

The ISO 13346/ECMA-167 standard was designed in conjunction to the ISO 13490 standard. This new format addresses most of the shortcomings of ISO 9660, and a subset of it evolved into the Universal Disk Format (UDF), which was adopted for DVDs. The volume descriptor table retains the ISO9660 layout, but the identifier has been updated.

== Disc images ==

Optical disc images are a common way to electronically transfer the contents of CD-ROMs. They often have the filename extension codice_25 (codice_26 is less common, but also in use) and are commonly referred to as &quot;ISOs&quot;.

== Platforms ==

Most operating systems support reading of ISO 9660 formatted discs, and most new versions support the extensions such as Rock Ridge and Joliet. Operating systems that do not support the extensions usually show the basic (non-extended) features of a plain ISO 9660 disc.

Operating systems that support ISO 9660 and its extensions include the following:

* DOS: access with extensions, such as MSCDEX.EXE (Microsoft CDROM Extension), NWCDEX.EXE or CORELCDX.EXE
* Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME: can read ISO 9660 Level 1, 2, 3, and Joliet
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and newer Windows versions, can read ISO 9660 Level 1, 2, 3, Joliet, and ISO 9660:1999. Windows 7 may also mistake UDF format for CDFS. for more information see UDF.
* Linux and BSD: ISO 9660 Level 1, 2, 3, Joliet, Rock Ridge, and ISO 9660:1999
* Apple GS/OS: ISO Level 1 and 2 support via the HS.FST File System Translator.
* Classic Mac OS 7 to 9: ISO Level 1, 2. Optional free software supports Rock Ridge and Joliet (including ISO Level 3): Joke Ridge and Joliet Volume Access.
* macOS (all versions): ISO Level 1, 2, Joliet and Rock Ridge Extensions. Level 3 is not currently supported, although users have been able to mount these discs
* AmigaOS supports the &quot;AS&quot; extensions (which preserve the Amiga protection bits and file comments)
* QNX
* ULTRIX
* OS/2, eComStation and ArcaOS
* BeOS, Zeta and Haiku
* OpenVMS supports only ISO 9660 Interchange levels 1–3, with &quot;no&quot; extensions
* RISC OS support for optical media written on a PC is patchy. Most CD-Rs/RWs work perfectly, however DVD+-Rs/RWs/RAMs are entirely hit and miss running RISC OS 4.02, RISC OS 4.39 and RISC OS 6.20

<text>Ice skating is the self-propulsion and gliding of a person across an ice surface, using metal-bladed ice skates. People skate for various reasons, including recreation (fun), exercise, competitive sports, and commuting. Ice skating may be performed on naturally frozen bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers, and on human-made ice surfaces both indoors and outdoors.

Natural ice surfaces used by skaters can accommodate a variety of winter sports which generally require an enclosed area, but are also used by skaters who need ice tracks and trails for distance skating and speed skating. Man-made ice surfaces include ice rinks, ice hockey rinks, bandy fields, ice tracks required for the sport of ice cross downhill, and arenas.

Various formal sports involving ice skating have emerged since the 19th century. Ice hockey, bandy, rinkball, and ringette are team sports played with, respectively, a flat sliding puck, a ball, and a rubber ring. Synchronized skating is a unique artistic team sport derived from figure skating. Figure skating, ice cross downhill, speed skating, and barrel jumping (a discipline of speed skating) are among the sporting disciplines for individuals.

==History==
===Early history of ice skating===
Research suggests that the earliest ice skating happened in southern Finland more than 4,000 years ago. This was done to save energy during winter journeys. True skating emerged when a steel blade with sharpened edges was used. Skates now cut into the ice instead of gliding on top of it. The Dutch added edges to ice skates in the 13th or 14th century. These ice skates were made of steel, with sharpened edges on the bottom to aid movement.

The fundamental construction of modern ice skates has stayed largely the same since then, although differing greatly in the details, particularly in the method of binding and the shape and construction of the steel blades. In the Netherlands, ice skating was considered proper for all classes of people, as shown in many pictures from Dutch Golden Age painters.

Ice skating was also practiced in China during the Song dynasty, and became popular among the ruling family of the Qing dynasty. Ancient ice skates, made of animal bones, were found at the bronze age Gaotai Ruins in north west China, and are estimated to be likely 3,500 years old. Archeologists say these ancient skates are &quot;clear evidence for communication between China and Europe&quot; in the Bronze Age era, as they are very similar to bone skates unearthed in Europe.

===Rising popularity and first clubs===

In England &quot;the London boys&quot; had improvised butcher&#x27;s bones as skates since the 12th century. Skating on metal skates seems to have arrived in England at the same time as the garden canal, with the English Restoration in 1660, after the king and court returned from an exile largely spent in the Netherlands. In London the ornamental &quot;canal&quot; in St James&#x27;s Park was the main centre until the 19th century. Both Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn, the two leading diarists of the day, saw it on the &quot;new canal&quot; there on 1 December 1662, the first time Pepys had ever seen it (&quot;a very pretty art&quot;). Then it was &quot;performed before their Majesties and others, by diverse gentlemen and others, with scheets after the manner of the Hollanders&quot;. Two weeks later, on 15 December 1662, Pepys accompanied the Duke of York, later King James II, on a skating outing: &quot;To the Duke, and followed him in the Park, when, though the ice was broken, he would go slide upon his skates, which I did not like; but he slides very well.&quot; In 1711 Jonathan Swift still thinks the sport might be unfamiliar to his &quot;Stella&quot;, writing to her: &quot;Delicate walking weather; and the Canal and Rosamund&#x27;s Pond full of the rabble and with skates, &quot;if you know what that is&quot;.&quot;

The first organised skating club was the Edinburgh Skating Club, formed in the 1740s; some claim the club was established as early as 1642.An early contemporary reference to the club appeared in the second edition (1783) of the Encyclopædia Britannica:

From this description and others, it is apparent that the form of skating practiced by club members was indeed an early form of figure skating rather than speed skating. For admission to the club, candidates had to pass a skating test where they performed a complete circle on either foot (e.g., a figure eight), and then jumped over first one hat, then two and three, placed over each other on the ice.

On the Continent, participation in ice skating was limited to members of the upper classes. Emperor Rudolf II of the Holy Roman Empire enjoyed ice skating so much, he had a large ice carnival constructed in his court in order to popularise the sport. King Louis XVI of France brought ice skating to Paris during his reign. Madame de Pompadour, Napoleon I, Napoleon III, and the House of Stuart were, among others, royal and upper-class fans of ice skating.

The next skating club to be established was in London and was not founded until 1830. Members wore a silver skate hanging from their buttonhole and met on The Serpentine, Hyde Park on 27 December 1830.
By the mid-19th century, ice skating was a popular pastime among the British upper and middle classes. Queen Victoria became acquainted with her future husband, Prince Albert, through a series of ice skating trips. Albert continued to skate after their marriage and on falling through the ice was once rescued by Victoria and a lady in waiting from a stretch of water in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

Early attempts at the construction of artificial ice rinks were made during the &quot;rink mania&quot; of 1841–44. As the technology for the maintenance of natural ice did not exist, these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of hog&#x27;s lard and various salts. An item in the 8 May 1844 issue of Littell&#x27;s &#x27;Living Age&#x27; headed the &#x27;Glaciarium&#x27; reported that &quot;This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton Street East&#x27; Tottenham Court Road, was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating.&quot;
===Emergence as a sport===

Skating became popular as a recreation, a means of transport and spectator sport in The Fens in England for people from all walks of life. Racing was the preserve of workers, most of them agricultural labourers. It is not known when the first skating matches were held, but by the early nineteenth century racing was well established and the results of matches were reported in the press. Skating as a sport developed on the lakes of Scotland and the canals of the Netherlands. In the 13th and 14th centuries wood was substituted for bone in skate blades, and in 1572 the first iron skates were manufactured. When the waters froze, skating matches were held in towns and villages all over the Fens. In these local matches men (or sometimes women or children) would compete for prizes of money, clothing, or food.

The winners of local matches were invited to take part in the grand or championship matches, in which skaters from across the Fens would compete for cash prizes in front of crowds of thousands. The championship matches took the form of a Welsh main or &quot;last man standing&quot; contest (single-elimination tournament). The competitors, 16 or sometimes 32, were paired off in heats and the winner of each heat went through to the next round. A course of 660 yards was measured out on the ice, and a barrel with a flag on it placed at either end. For a one-and-a-half-mile race the skaters completed two rounds of the course, with three barrel turns.
In the Fens, skates were called pattens, fen runners, or Whittlesey runners. The footstock was made of beechwood. A screw at the back was screwed into the heel of the boot, and three small spikes at the front kept the skate steady. There were holes in the footstock for leather straps to fasten it to the foot. The metal blades were slightly higher at the back than the front. In the 1890s, fen skaters started to race in Norwegian style skates.

On Saturday 1 February 1879, a number of professional ice skaters from Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire met in the Guildhall, Cambridge, to set up the National Skating Association, the first national ice skating body in the world. The founding committee consisted of several landowners, a vicar, a fellow of Trinity College, a magistrate, two members of parliament, the mayor of Cambridge, the Lord Lieutenant of Cambridge, journalist James Drake Digby, the president of Cambridge University Skating Club, and Neville Goodman, a graduate of Peterhouse, Cambridge (and son of Potto Brown&#x27;s milling partner, Joseph Goodman). The newly formed Association held their first one-and-a-half-mile British professional championship at Thorney in December 1879.

===Figure skating===

The first instructional book concerning ice skating was published in London in 1772. The book titled &quot;The Art of Figure Skating&quot;, written by a British artillery lieutenant, Robert Jones, describes basic figure skating forms such as circles and figure eights. The book was written solely for men, as women did not normally ice skate in the late 18th century. It was with the publication of this manual that ice skating split into its two main disciplines, speed skating and figure skating.

The founder of modern figure skating as it is known today was Jackson Haines, an American. He was the first skater to incorporate ballet and dance movements into his skating, as opposed to focusing on tracing patterns on the ice. Haines also invented the sit spin and developed a shorter, curved blade for figure skating that allowed for easier turns. He was also the first to wear blades that were permanently attached to the boot.

The International Skating Union was founded in 1892 as the first international ice skating organisation in Scheveningen, in the Netherlands. The Union created the first codified set of figure skating rules and governed international competition in speed and figure skating. The first Championship, known as the Championship of the Internationale Eislauf-Vereinigung, was held in Saint Petersburg in 1896. The event had four competitors and was won by Gilbert Fuchs.
== Physical mechanics of skating==

A skate can glide over ice because there is a layer of ice molecules on the surface that are not as tightly bound as the molecules of the mass of ice beneath. These molecules are in a semiliquid state, providing lubrication. The molecules in this &quot;quasi-fluid&quot; or &quot;water-like&quot; layer are less mobile than liquid water, but are much more mobile than the molecules deeper in the ice. At about the slippery layer is one molecule thick; as the temperature increases the slippery layer becomes thicker.

It had long been believed that ice is slippery because the pressure of an object in contact with it causes a thin layer to melt. The hypothesis was that the blade of an ice skate, exerting pressure on the ice, melts a thin layer, providing lubrication between the ice and the blade. This explanation, called &quot;pressure melting&quot;, originated in the 19th century. (See Regelation.) Pressure melting could not account for skating on ice temperatures lower than −3.5 °C, whereas skaters often skate on lower-temperature ice.

In the 20th century, an alternative explanation, called &quot;friction melting&quot;, proposed by Lozowski, Szilder, Le Berre, Pomeau, and others showed that because of the viscous frictional heating, a macroscopic layer of melt ice is in-between the ice and the skate. With this they fully explained the low friction with nothing else but macroscopic physics, whereby the frictional heat generated between skate and ice melts a layer of ice. This is a self-stabilizing mechanism of skating. If by fluctuation the friction gets high, the layer grows in thickness and lowers the friction, and if it gets low, the layer decreases in thickness and increases the friction. The friction generated in the sheared layer of water between skate and ice grows as &quot;√V&quot; with &quot;V&quot; the velocity of the skater, such that for low velocities the friction is also low.

Whatever the origin of the water layer, skating is more destructive than simply gliding. A skater leaves a visible trail behind on virgin ice and skating rinks have to be regularly resurfaced to improve the skating conditions. It means that the deformation caused by the skate is plastic rather than elastic. The skate ploughs through the ice in particular due to the sharp edges. Van Leeuwen proposed that another component has to be added to the friction: the &quot;ploughing friction&quot;. The calculated frictions are of the same order as the measured frictions in real skating in a rink. The ploughing friction decreases with the velocity &quot;V&quot;, since the pressure in the water layer increases with V and lifts the skate (aquaplaning). As a result the sum of the water-layer friction and the ploughing friction only increases slightly with &quot;V&quot;, making skating at high speeds (&gt;90 km/h) possible.

==Inherent safety risks==

A person&#x27;s ability to ice skate depends on the roughness of the ice, the design of the ice skate, and the skill and experience of the skater. While serious injury is rare, a number of short track speed skaters have been paralysed after a heavy fall when they collided with the boarding. A fall can be fatal if a helmet is not worn to protect against severe head injury. Accidents are rare but there is a risk of injury from collisions, particularly during hockey games or in pair skating.

A significant danger when skating outdoors on a frozen body of water is falling through the ice into the freezing water underneath. Death can result from shock, hypothermia, or drowning. It is often difficult or impossible for the skater to climb out of the water, due to the weight of their ice skates and thick winter clothing, and the ice repeatedly breaking as they struggle to get back onto the surface. Also, if the skater becomes disoriented under the water, they might not be able to find the hole in the ice through which they have fallen. Although this can prove fatal, it is also possible for the rapid cooling to produce a condition in which a person can be revived up to hours after falling into the water. Experts have warned not to ice skate alone, and also warned parents not to leave children unattended on a frozen body of water.

==Communal activities on ice==

A number of recreational and sporting activities take place on ice:

== IOC member oath ==
All IOC members must swear to the following:

&quot;Honoured to be chosen as a member of the International Olympic Committee,
I fully accept all the responsibilities that this office brings:
I promise to serve the Olympic Movement to the best of my ability.
I will respect the Olympic Charter and accept the decisions of the IOC.
I will always act independently of commercial and political interests as well as
of any racial or religious consideration.
I will fully comply with the IOC Code of Ethics.
I promise to fight against all forms of discrimination and dedicate myself
in all circumstances to promote the interests of the International Olympic
Committee and Olympic Movement.&quot;

==History==
The IOC was created by Pierre de Coubertin, on 23 June 1894 with Demetrios Vikelas as its first president. As of February 2022, its membership consists of 105 active members and 45 honorary members. The IOC is the supreme authority of the worldwide modern Olympic Movement.

The IOC organises the modern Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games (YOG), held in summer and winter every four years. The first Summer Olympics was held in Athens, Greece, in 1896; the first Winter Olympics was in Chamonix, France, in 1924. The first Summer YOG was in Singapore in 2010, and the first Winter YOG was in Innsbruck, Austria in 2012.

Until 1992, both the Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same year. After that year, however, the IOC shifted the Winter Olympics to the even years between Summer Games to help space the planning of the two events from one another, and to improve the financial balance of the IOC, which receives a proportionally greater income in Olympic years.

Since 1995, the IOC has worked to address environmental health concerns resulting from hosting the games. In 1995, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch stated, &quot;the International Olympic Committee is resolved to ensure that the environment becomes the third dimension of the organization of the Olympic Games, the first and second being sport and culture.&quot; Acting on this statement, in 1996 the IOC added the &quot;environment&quot; as a third pillar to its vision for the Olympic Games.

In 2000, the &quot;Green Olympics&quot; effort was developed by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Beijing Olympic Games. The Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics executed over 160 projects addressing the goals of improved air quality and water quality, sustainable energy, improved waste management, and environmental education. These projects included industrial plant relocation or closure, furnace replacement, introduction of new emission standards, and more strict traffic control.

In 2009, the UN General Assembly granted the IOC Permanent Observer status. The decision enables the IOC to be directly involved in the UN Agenda and to attend UN General Assembly meetings where it can take the floor. In 1993, the General Assembly approved a Resolution to further solidify IOC–UN cooperation by reviving the Olympic Truce.

The IOC received approval in November 2015 to construct a new headquarters in Vidy, Lausanne. The cost of the project was estimated to stand at $156m. The IOC announced on 11 February 2019 that the &quot;Olympic House&quot; would be inaugurated on 23 June 2019 to coincide with its 125th anniversary. The Olympic Museum remains in Ouchy, Lausanne.

Since 2002, the IOC has been involved in several high-profile controversies including taking gifts, its DMCA take down request of the 2008 Tibetan protest videos, Russian doping scandals, and its support of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics despite China&#x27;s human rights violations documented in the Xinjiang Papers.

Detailed frameworks for environmental sustainability were prepared for the 2018 Winter Olympics and 2020 Summer Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, and Tokyo, Japan, respectively.

In September 2024, the IOC revealed its list of candidates for the presidency, featuring Sebastian Coe, David Lappartient, Kirsty Coventry, and Juan Antonio Samaranch Salisachs among the seven contenders. The other candidates included Prince Faisal bin Hussein and the Presidents of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation and the International Gymnastics Federation, Johan Eliasch and Morinari Watanabe.

In February 2025, the IOC announced the inaugural Olympic Esports Games would take place in 2027 in Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia. The IOC will collaborate with the Esports World Cup Foundation (EWCF) to produce the event, which President Thomas Bach called &quot;historic&quot;.

==Olympic marketing==

During the first half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget. As IOC president from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests. Brundage believed that corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC&#x27;s decision-making. Brundage&#x27;s resistance to this revenue stream left IOC organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.

When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2 million in assets; eight years later coffers had swollen, to US$45 million. This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights. When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent. Samaranch appointed Canadian IOC member Richard Pound to lead the initiative as Chairman of the &quot;New Sources of Finance Commission&quot;.

In 1982 the IOC drafted International Sport and Leisure, a Swiss sports marketing company, to develop a global marketing programme for the Olympic Movement. ISL developed the programme, but was replaced by Meridian Management, a company partly owned by the IOC in the early 1990s. In 1989, a staff member at ISL Marketing, Michael Payne, moved to the IOC and became the organisation&#x27;s first marketing director. ISL and then Meridian continued in the established role as the IOC&#x27;s sales and marketing agents until 2002. In collaboration with ISL Marketing and Meridian Management, Payne made major contributions to the creation of a multibillion-dollar sponsorship marketing programme for the organisation which, along with improvements in TV marketing and improved financial management, helped to restore the IOC&#x27;s financial viability.

===Revenue===
The Olympic Movement generates revenue through five major programmes.

*Broadcast partnerships, managed by the IOC.
*Commercial sponsorship, organised through the IOC&#x27;s worldwide TOP programme.
*Domestic sponsorship, managed by the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs).
*Ticketing.
*Licensing programmes within host countries.

The OCOGs have responsibility for domestic sponsorship, ticketing and licensing programmes, under the direction of the IOC. The Olympic Movement generated a total of more than US$4 billion (€2.5 billion) in revenue during the Olympic quadrennium from 2001 to 2004.

;Revenue distribution
The IOC distributes some of its revenue to organisations throughout the Olympic Movement to support the staging of the Olympic Games and to promote worldwide sport development. The IOC retains approximately 10% of the Olympic marketing revenue for operational and administrative costs. For the 2013–2016 period, the IOC had revenues of about US$5.0 billion, of which 73% were from broadcasting rights and 18% were from Olympic Partners. The Rio 2016 organising committee received US$1.5 billion and the Sochi 2014 organising committee received US$833 million. National Olympic committees and international federations received US$739 million each.

In July 2000, when the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on how the IOC redistributes profits from sponsorships and broadcasting rights, historian Bob Barney stated that he had &quot;yet to see matters of corruption in the IOC&quot;, but noted there were &quot;matters of unaccountability&quot;. He later noted that when the spotlight is on the athletes, it has &quot;the power to eclipse impressions of scandal or corruption&quot;, with respect to the Olympic bid process.
===Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games===
The IOC provides TOP programme contributions and broadcast revenue to the OCOGs to support the staging of the Olympic Games:
*TOP programme revenue: the two OCOGs of each Olympic quadrennium generally share approximately 50% of TOP programme revenue and value-in-kind contributions, with approximately 30% provided to the summer OCOG and 20% provided to the winter OCOG.
*Broadcast revenue: the IOC contributes 49% of the Olympic broadcast revenue for each Games to the OCOG. During the 2001–2004 Olympic quadrennium, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee received US$443 million, €395 million in broadcast revenue from the IOC, and the Athens 2004 Organizing Committee received US$732 million, €690 million.
*Domestic programme revenue: the OCOGs generate substantial revenue from the domestic marketing programmes that they manage within the host country, including domestic sponsorship, ticketing, and licensing.

===National Olympic Committees===

NOCs receive financial support for training and developing their Olympic teams, Olympic athletes, and Olympic hopefuls. The IOC distributes TOP programme revenue to each NOC. The IOC also contributes Olympic broadcast revenue to Olympic Solidarity, an IOC organisation that provides financial support to NOCs with the greatest need. The continued success of the TOP programme and Olympic broadcast agreements has enabled the IOC to provide increased support for the NOCs with each Olympic quadrennium. The IOC provided approximately US$318.5 million to NOCs for the 2001–2004 quadrennium.

===International Olympic Sports Federations===
The IOC is the largest single revenue source for the majority of IOSFs, with contributions that assist them in developing their respective sports. The IOC provides financial support to the 28 IOSFs of Olympic summer sports and the seven IOSFs of Olympic winter sports. The continually increasing value of Olympic broadcasts has enabled the IOC to substantially increase financial support to IOSFs with each successive Games. The seven winter sports IFs shared US$85.8 million, €75 million in Salt Lake 2002 broadcast revenue.

===Other organizations===
The IOC contributes Olympic marketing revenue to the programmes of various recognized international sports organizations, including the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

==Environmental concerns==
The IOC requires cities bidding to host the Olympics to provide a comprehensive strategy to protect the environment in preparation for hosting, and following the conclusion of the Games.

===IOC approaches===
The IOC has four major approaches to addressing environmental health concerns.

* IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission focuses on how the IOC can improve the strategies and policies associated with environmental health throughout the process of hosting the Olympic Games. 
* Every candidate city must provide information on environmental health issues such as air quality and environmental impact assessments. 
* Every host city is given the option to declare &quot;pledges&quot; to address specific or general environmental health concerns. 
* Every host city must collaborate with the United Nations to work towards addressing environmental health objectives.

===Venue construction ===

==== Effects on air ====
Host cities have concerns about traffic congestion and air pollution, both of which can compromise air quality during and after venue construction. Various air quality improvement measures are undertaken before and after each event. Traffic control is the primary method to reduce concentrations of air pollutants, including barring heavy vehicles.

===== Beijing Olympics =====
Research at the Beijing Olympic Games identified particulate matter – measured in terms of PM10 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle ≤ 10 μm in a given amount of air) – as a top priority. Particulate matter, along with other airborne pollutants, cause both serious health problems, such as asthma, and damage urban ecosystems. Black carbon is released into the air from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fluids, contributing to climate change and injuring human health. Secondary pollutants such as CO, NOx, SO2, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) are also released during construction.

For the Beijing Olympics, vehicles not meeting the Euro 1 emission standards were banned, and the odd-even rule was implemented in the Beijing administrative area. Air quality improvement measures implemented by the Beijing government included replacing coal with natural gas, suspending construction, imposing strict dust control on construction sites, closing or relocating the polluting industrial plants, building long subway lines, using cleaner fluid in power plants, and reducing the activity by some of the polluting factories. There, levels of primary and secondary pollutants were reduced, and good air quality was recorded during the Beijing Olympics on most days. Beijing also sprayed silver iodide in the atmosphere to induce rain to remove existing pollutants from the air.

==== Effects on soil ====
Soil contamination can occur during construction. 
The Sydney Olympic Games of 2000 resulted in improving a highly contaminated area known as Homebush Bay. A pre-Games study reported soil metal concentrations high enough to potentially contaminate groundwater. A remediation strategy was developed. Contaminated soil was consolidated into four containment areas within the site, which left the remaining areas available for recreational use. The site contained waste materials that then no longer posed a threat to surrounding aquifers.
In the 2006 Games in Torino, Italy, soil impacts were observed. Before the Games, researchers studied four areas that the Games would likely affect: a floodplain, a highway, the motorway connecting the city to Lyon, France, and a landfill. They analyzed the chemicals in these areas before and after the Games. Their findings revealed an increase in the number of metals in the topsoil post-Games, and indicated that soil was capable of buffering the effects of many but not all heavy metals. Mercury, lead, and arsenic may have been transferred into the food chain.

One promise made to Londoners for the 2012 Olympic Games was that the Olympic Park would be a &quot;blueprint for sustainable living.&quot; However, garden allotments were temporarily relocated due to the building of the Olympic stadium. The allotments were eventually returned. However, the soil quality was damaged. Further, allotment residents were exposed to radioactive waste for five months prior to moving, during the excavation of the site for the Games. Other local residents, construction workers, and onsite archaeologists faced similar exposures and risks.

==== Effects on water ====
The Olympic Games can affect water quality in several ways, including runoff and the transfer of polluting substances from the air to water sources through rainfall. Harmful particulates come from natural substances (such as plant matter crushed by higher volumes of pedestrian and vehicle traffic) and man-made substances (such as exhaust from vehicles or industry). Contaminants from these two categories elevate amounts of toxins in street dust. Street dust reaches water sources through runoff, facilitating the transfer of toxins to environments and communities that rely on these water sources.

In 2013, researchers in Beijing found a significant relationship between the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and in rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had transferred a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources. Notably, this cleared the air of such particulates, substantially improving air quality at the venues.

==Reception and incidences==
===Amateurism and professionalism===
De Coubertin was influenced by the aristocratic ethos exemplified by English public schools. The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education but that practicing or training was considered cheating. As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated. The advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot; of Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the notion of the pure amateur, as it put Western, self-financed amateurs at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism.

Near the end of the 1960s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet full-time athletes and other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues, but met opposition from the IIHF and IOC. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players at the 1970 World Championships in Montreal and Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The decision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage declared that the change would put ice hockey&#x27;s status as an Olympic sport in jeopardy. In response, Canada withdrew from international ice hockey competition and officials stated that they would not return until &quot;open competition&quot; was instituted.

Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism was gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. After the 1988 Games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, subject to the approval of the IFOSs.

=== Bid controversies ===

==== 1976 Winter Olympics ====
The Games were originally awarded to Denver on 12 May 1970, but a steep rise in costs led to Colorado voters&#x27; rejection on 7 November 1972, by 60% of the vote, of a $5 million bond issue to finance the Games with public funds.

Denver officially withdrew on 15 November: the IOC then offered the Games to Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, but they too declined due to a change of government following elections.

Salt Lake City, Utah, a 1972 Winter Olympics final candidate (who eventually hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics) offered itself as a potential host after Denver&#x27;s withdrawal, but the IOC declined Salt Lake City&#x27;s offer. On 5 February 1973, the IOC selected Innsbruck, the city that had hosted the Games twelve years earlier.

====1998 Winter Olympics====
Eight years after the 1998 Winter Olympics, a report ordered by the Nagano region&#x27;s governor said the Japanese city provided millions of dollars in an &quot;illegitimate and excessive level of hospitality&quot; to IOC members, including US$4.4 million spent on entertainment. Earlier reports put the figure at approximately US$14 million. The precise figures are unknown: after the IOC asked that the entertainment expenditures not be made public Nagano destroyed its financial records.

==== 2002 Winter Olympics ====
A scandal broke on 10 December 1998, when Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler, head of the coordination committee overseeing the organisation of the 2002 Games, announced that several members of the IOC had received gifts from members of the Salt Lake City 2002 bid Committee in exchange for votes. Soon four independent investigations were underway: by the IOC, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), the SLOC, and the United States Department of Justice. Before any of the investigations could get under way, SLOC co-heads Tom Welch and David Johnson both resigned their posts. Many others soon followed. The Department of Justice filed fifteen counts of bribery and fraud against the pair.

As a result of the investigation, ten IOC members were expelled and another ten were sanctioned. Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were put into place as to how much IOC members could accept from bid cities. Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, an Athlete&#x27;s Commission was created and fifteen former Olympic athletes gained provisional membership status.

==== 2008 Summer Olympics ====
In 2000, international human rights groups attempted to pressure the IOC to reject Beijing&#x27;s bid to protest human rights in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. One Chinese dissident was sentenced to two years in prison during an IOC tour. After the city won the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, Amnesty International and others expressed concerns regarding the human rights situation. The second principle in the Fundamental Principles of Olympism, Olympic Charter states that &quot;The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.&quot; Amnesty International considered PRC policies and practices as violating that principle.

Some days before the Opening Ceremonies, in August 2008, the IOC issued DMCA take down notices on Tibetan Protests videos on YouTube. YouTube and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) pushed back against the IOC, which then withdrew their complaint.

====2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics====
On 1 March 2016, Owen Gibson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that French financial prosecutors investigating corruption in world athletics had expanded their remit to include the bidding and voting processes for the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Olympics. The story followed an earlier report in January by Gibson, who revealed that Papa Massata Diack, the son of then-IAAF president Lamine Diack, appeared to arrange for &quot;parcels&quot; to be delivered to six IOC members in 2008 when Qatar was bidding for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, though it failed to make it beyond the shortlist. Weeks later, Qatari authorities denied the allegations. Gibson then reported that a €1.3m (£1m, $1.5m) payment from the Tokyo Olympic Committee team to an account linked to Papa Diack was made during Japan&#x27;s successful race to host the 2020 Summer Games. The following day, French prosecutors confirmed they were investigating allegations of &quot;corruption and money laundering&quot; of more than $2m in suspicious payments made by the Tokyo 2020 Olympic bid committee to a secret bank account linked to Diack. Tsunekazu Takeda of the Tokyo 2020 bid committee responded on 17 May 2016, denying allegations of wrongdoing, and refused to reveal transfer details. The controversy was reignited on 11 January 2019 after it emerged Takeda had been indicted on corruption charges in France over his role in the bid process.

==== 2022 Winter Olympics ====
In 2014, at the final stages of the bid process for 2022, Oslo, seen as the favourite, surprised with a withdrawal. Following a string of local controversies over the masterplan, local officials were outraged by IOC demands on athletes and the Olympic family. In addition, allegations about lavish treatment of stakeholders, including separate lanes to &quot;be created on all roads where IOC members will travel, which are not to be used by regular people or public transportation&quot;, exclusive cars and drivers for IOC members. The differential treatment irritated Norwegians. The IOC demanded &quot;control over all advertising space throughout Oslo and the subsites during the Games, to be used exclusively by official sponsors.&quot;

Human rights groups and governments criticised the committee for allowing Beijing to bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Some weeks before the Opening Ceremonies, the Xinjiang Papers were released, documenting abuses by the Chinese government against the Uyghur population in Xinjiang, documenting what many governments described as genocide.

Many government officials, notably those in the United States and the Great Britain, called for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Games. The IOC responded to concerns by saying that the Olympic Games must not be politicised. Some nations diplomatically boycotted games, which prohibited a diplomatic delegation from representing a nation at the games, rather than a full boycott that would have barred athletes from competing. In September 2021, the IOC suspended the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, after they boycotted the 2020 Summer Olympics claiming &quot;COVID-19 Concerns&quot;.

On 8 September 2021, after the IOC suspended the North Korean NOC for not being present at the 2020 Summer Olympics, there was speculation about whether the IOC was also intending to send a message to nations considering a boycott of the games that they could be banned from participation in future Olympic Games if they chose to boycott this edition. On 14 October 2021, vice-president of the IOC, John Coates, announced that the IOC had no plans to challenge the Chinese government on humanitarian issues, stating that the issues were &quot;not within the IOC&#x27;s remit&quot;.

=== Sex verification controversies ===
The IOC uses sex verification to ensure participants compete only in events matching their sex. Verifying the sex of Olympic participants dates back to ancient Greece, when Kallipateira attempted to break Greek law by dressing as a man to enter the arena as a trainer. After she was discovered, a policy was erected wherein trainers, just as athletes, were made to appear naked in order to better assure all were male.

In more recent history, sex verification has taken many forms and been subject to dispute. Before sex testing, Olympic officials relied on &quot;nude parades&quot; and doctor&#x27;s notes. Successful women athletes perceived to be masculine were most likely to be inspected. In 1966, IOC implemented a compulsory sex verification process that took effect at the 1968 Winter Olympics where a lottery system was used to determine who would be inspected with a Barr body test. The scientific community found fault with this policy. The use of the Barr body test was evaluated by fifteen geneticists who unanimously agreed it was scientifically invalid. By the 1970s this method was replaced with PCR testing, as well as evaluating factors such as brain anatomy and behavior. Following continued backlash against mandatory sex testing, the IOC&#x27;s Athletes&#x27; Commission&#x27;s opposition ended of the practice in 1999.

Although sex testing was no longer mandated, women who did not present as feminine continued to be inspected based on suspicion. This started at 2000 Summer Olympics and remained in use until the 2010 Winter Olympics. By 2011 the IOC created a Hyperandrogenism Regulation, which aimed to standardise natural testosterone levels in women athletes. This transition in sex testing was to assure fairness within female events. This was due to the belief that higher testosterone levels increased athletic ability and gave unfair advantages to intersex and transgender competitors. Any female athlete flagged for suspicion and whose testosterone surpassed regulation levels was prohibited from competing until medical treatment brought their hormone levels within standard levels. It has been argued by press, scholars, and politicians that some ethnicities are disproportionately impacted by this regulation and that the rule excludes too many.

The most notable cases of bans testing results are: Maria José Martínez-Patiño (1985), Santhi Soundarajan (2006), Caster Semenya (2009), Annet Negesa (2012), and Dutee Chand (2014).

Before the 2014 Asian Games, Indian athlete Dutee Chand was banned from competing internationally having been found to be in violation of the Hyperandrogenism Regulation. Following the denial of her appeal by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the IOC suspended the policy for the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics.

=== London 2012 and the Munich massacre ===
Before the start of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the IOC decided not to hold a minute of silence to honour the 11 Israeli Olympians who were killed 40 years prior in the Munich massacre. Jacques Rogge, the then-IOC President, said it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to do so. Speaking of the decision, Israeli Olympian Shaul Ladany, who had survived the Munich Massacre, commented: &quot;I do not understand. I do not understand, and I do not accept it&quot;.

=== Wrestling ===
In February 2013, the IOC excluded wrestling from its core Olympic sports for the Summer Olympic programme for the 2020 Summer Olympics, because the sport did not offer equal opportunities for men and women. This decision was attacked by the sporting community, given the wrestling&#x27;s long tradition at the Olympics. After reassessment, however, wrestling was placed among the core Olympic sports again, a status it will hold until at least 2032.

=== Russian doping ===

Media attention began growing in December 2014 when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report and the World Athletics (then known as the IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported that they were unable to fully carry out their work and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.
After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren. McLaren&#x27;s investigation found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a &quot;state-directed failsafe system&quot; using a &quot;disappearing positive [test] methodology&quot; (DPM) from &quot;at least late 2011 to August 2015&quot;.

In response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code and recommended that Russia be banned from competing at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that a separate decision would be made for each athlete by the relevant IF and the IOC, based on the athlete&#x27;s individual circumstances. One day prior to the opening ceremony, 270 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 167 were removed because of doping. In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag (for a non-doping related matter).

In contrast to the IOC, the IPC voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, having found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.

On 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended effective immediately from the 2018 Winter Olympics. Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag as an &quot;Olympic Athlete from Russia&quot; (OAR). Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country&#x27;s flag nor anthem would be present. The Olympic Flag and Olympic Anthem would be used instead, and on 20 December 2017 the IOC proposed an alternate uniform logo.

On 1 February 2018, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence for 28 athletes, and overturned their IOC sanctions. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics. The IOC said in a statement that &quot;the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation&quot; and that &quot;this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping&quot;. The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General &quot;insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent&quot; and that they would consider an appeal against the court&#x27;s decision. Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite numerous failed drug tests by Russian athletes in the 2018 Olympics. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian rejection of the McLaren Report.

=== 2018 plebiscite in Taiwan ===
On 24 November 2018, the Taiwanese government held a referendum over a change in the naming of their National Olympic Committee, from &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;, a name agreed to in 1981 by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the Nagoya Protocol, which denies the Republic of China&#x27;s legitimacy, to simply &quot;Taiwan&quot;, after the main island in the Free Area. In the immediate days prior to the referendum, the IOC and the PRC government, issued a threatening statement, suggesting that if the team underwent the name change, the IOC had the legal right to make a &quot;suspension of or forced withdrawal,&quot; of the team from the 2020 Summer Olympics. In response to the allegations of election interference, the IOC stated, &quot;The IOC does not interfere with local procedures and fully respects freedom of expression. However, to avoid any unnecessary expectations or speculations, the IOC wishes to reiterate that this matter is under its jurisdiction.&quot; Subsequently, with a significant PRC pressure, the referendum failed in Taiwan with 45% to 54%.

===Peng Shuai disappearance===
In November 2021, the IOC was again criticised by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others for its response to the 2021 disappearance of Peng Shuai, following her publishing of sexual assault allegations against a former Chinese vice premier, and high-ranking member of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang Gaoli.
The IOC&#x27;s response was internationally criticised as complicit in assisting the Chinese government to silence Peng&#x27;s sexual assault allegations. Zhang Gaoli previously led the Beijing bidding committee to host the 2022 Winter Olympics.

===Fencing handshaking controversy===
In July 2020 (and reconfirmed in September 2020 and in January 2021), the FIE replaced its previous handshake requirement with a &quot;salute&quot; by the opposing fencers, writing in a public notice that handshakes were &quot;suspended until further notice.&quot; Nevertheless, in July 2023, the Ukrainian four-time world champion Olga Kharlan was disqualified at the World Fencing Championships for not shaking the hand of her defeated Russian opponent, although Kharlan instead offered a tapping of blades in acknowledgement. The President of the IOC, Thomas Bach, sent a letter to Kharlan in which he expressed empathy for her, and wrote that in light of the situation she was guaranteed a spot in the 2024 Summer Olympics. He wrote further: &quot;as a fellow fencer, it is impossible for me to imagine how you feel at this moment. The war against your country, the suffering of the people in Ukraine, the uncertainty around your participation at the Fencing World Championships ... and then the events which unfolded yesterday – all this is a roller coaster of emotions and feelings. It is admirable how you are managing this incredibly difficult situation, and I would like to express my full support to you. Rest assured that the IOC will continue to stand in full solidarity with the Ukrainian athletes and the Olympic community of Ukraine.&quot;

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
On 12 October 2023, the International Olympic Committee issued a statement stating that after Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Russian Olympic Committee unilaterally transferred four regions that were originally under the jurisdiction of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine: Donetsk Oblast, Luhansk Oblast, Kherson Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast were included as members of their own, so the International Olympic Committee announced the suspension of the membership of the Russian Olympic Committee with immediate effect.

On 19 March 2024, the IOC announced that, due to their suspension, Russian and Belarusian athletes would be barred from the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony as neither nation&#x27;s athletes were invited. Russia responded by accusing the IOC of being &quot;neo-nazis.&quot; Under the ruling, Russian athletes would not be allowed to participate in team events, and are not allowed to display the Russian flag. For 2026 Winter Games the IOC plans to continue this line, with approaching the International Biathlon Union and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation to allow Russian athletes compete in Olympic qualifications under a neutral flag.

=== Israel at the 2024 Summer Olympics ===
Palestinian sports organizations and sports organizations from Arab countries have called for sanctions to be imposed against Israel and to prevent its participation in the 2024 Summer Olympics due to the Israel–Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The calls from the organizations have been prompted by concerns about the war&#x27;s impact on Palestinian athletes and sports facilities. In November 2023, Russia accused the IOC of having double standards by not sanctioning Israel due to its military actions in Gaza and occupation of Palestine, as Palestine is also an IOC member. In January 2024, over 300 Palestinian sports clubs called for Israel to be barred from the 2024 Olympics after Israeli airstrikes had killed Palestine&#x27;s Olympic football team coach, and damaged the headquarters of the Palestine Olympic Committee in Gaza. The IOC has cautioned athletes against boycotting or discriminating others, stating that immediate action will follow any discriminatory behavior such as the case of Algerian judoka Fethi Nourine, who received a ten-year ban following his refusal to fight Tohar Butbul, an Israeli in 2020. The IOC also stated that athletes are not to be held accountable for their government&#x27;s actions. In March 2024, IOC President Thomas Bach made it clear there was no issue regarding Israel participating at the 2024 Summer Olympics and cautioned athletes against boycotts and discrimination.

=== 2024 WADA scandal ===
In late 2022 and early 2023 at different locations and different times, several athletes were suspended for testing positive for trace amounts of metandienone. This includes 23 Chinese swimmers who were suspended for more than a year, as samples collected on 6 October 2022 had trace amounts of metandienone. The lab later found that the samples were likely contaminated, as control testing revealed the presence of metandienone in substances such as nutrutional supplements and meat products.

In July 2024, the IOC threatened to withdraw Salt Lake City&#x27;s bid to host the 2034 Winter Olympics if U.S. authorities continued to investigate allegations of doping by Chinese swimmers. The IOC insisted that Salt Lake City agree that it may &quot;terminate Olympic host city contracts in cases where the supreme authority of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in the fight against doping is not fully respected or if the application of the world antidoping code is hindered or undermined.&quot; This was intended to undermine the United States Department of Justice&#x27;s criminal investigation into the allegations that the World Anti-Doping Agency covered up and failed to sanction drug use by Chinese swimmers.

<doc id="15150" wikidata="Q80831" url="?curid=15150" title="Integrated circuit">
<text>An integrated circuit (IC), also known as a microchip or simply chip, is a set of electronic circuits, consisting of various electronic components (such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors) and their interconnections. These components are etched onto a small, flat piece (&quot;chip&quot;) of semiconductor material, usually silicon. Integrated circuits are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including computers, smartphones, and televisions, to perform various functions such as processing and storing information. They have greatly impacted the field of electronics by enabling device miniaturization and enhanced functionality.

Integrated circuits are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete components, allowing a large transistor count.

The IC&#x27;s mass production capability, reliability, and building-block approach to integrated circuit design have ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones, and other home appliances are now essential parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs such as modern computer processors and microcontrollers.

Very-large-scale integration was made practical by technological advancements in semiconductor device fabrication. Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more transistors on chips of the same size – a modern chip may have many billions of transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail. These advances, roughly following Moore&#x27;s law, make the computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.

ICs have three main advantages over circuits constructed out of discrete components: size, cost and performance. The size and cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC&#x27;s components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity. The main disadvantage of ICs is the high initial cost of designing them and the enormous capital cost of factory construction. This high initial cost means ICs are only commercially viable when high production volumes are anticipated.

== Terminology ==
An &quot;integrated circuit&quot; is defined as: A circuit in which all or some of the circuit elements are inseparably associated and electrically interconnected so that it is considered to be indivisible for the purposes of construction and commerce. In strict usage, &quot;integrated circuit&quot; refers to the single-piece circuit construction originally known as a &quot;monolithic integrated circuit&quot;, which comprises a single piece of silicon. In general usage, circuits not meeting this strict definition are sometimes referred to as ICs, which are constructed using many different technologies, e.g. 3D IC, 2.5D IC, MCM, thin-film transistors, thick-film technologies, or hybrid integrated circuits. The choice of terminology frequently appears in discussions related to whether Moore&#x27;s Law is obsolete.

== History ==
An early attempt at combining several components in one device (like modern ICs) was the Loewe 3NF vacuum tube first made in 1926. Unlike ICs, it was designed with the purpose of tax avoidance, as in Germany, radio receivers had a tax that was levied depending on how many tube holders a radio receiver had. It allowed radio receivers to have a single tube holder. One million were manufactured, and were &quot;a first step in integration of radioelectronic devices&quot;. The device contained an amplifier, composed of three triodes, two capacitors and four resistors in a six-pin device. Radios with the Loewe 3NF were less expensive than other radios, showing one of the advantages of integration over using discrete components, that would be seen decades later with ICs.

Early concepts of an integrated circuit go back to 1949, when German engineer Werner Jacobi (Siemens AG) filed a patent for an integrated-circuit-like semiconductor amplifying device showing five transistors on a common substrate in a three-stage amplifier arrangement. Jacobi disclosed small and cheap hearing aids as typical industrial applications of his patent. An immediate commercial use of his patent has not been reported.

Another early proponent of the concept was Geoffrey Dummer (1909–2002), a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the British Ministry of Defence. Dummer presented the idea to the public at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in Washington, D.C., on 7 May 1952. He gave many symposia publicly to propagate his ideas and unsuccessfully attempted to build such a circuit in 1956. Between 1953 and 1957, Sidney Darlington and Yasuo Tarui (Electrotechnical Laboratory) proposed similar chip designs where several transistors could share a common active area, but there was no electrical isolation to separate them from each other.

The monolithic integrated circuit chip was enabled by the inventions of the planar process by Jean Hoerni and p–n junction isolation by Kurt Lehovec. Hoerni&#x27;s invention was built on Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick&#x27;s work on surface protection and passivation by silicon dioxide masking and predeposition, as well as Fuller, Ditzenberger&#x27;s and others work on the diffusion of impurities into silicon. 

=== The first integrated circuits ===


A precursor idea to the IC was to create small ceramic substrates (so-called &quot;micromodules&quot;), each containing a single miniaturized component. Components could then be integrated and wired into a bidimensional or tridimensional compact grid. This idea, which seemed very promising in 1957, was proposed to the US Army by Jack Kilby and led to the short-lived Micromodule Program (similar to 1951&#x27;s Project Tinkertoy). However, as the project was gaining momentum, Kilby came up with a new, revolutionary design: the IC.

Newly employed by Texas Instruments, Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working example of an integrated circuit on 12 September 1958. In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as &quot;a body of semiconductor material … wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated&quot;. The first customer for the new invention was the US Air Force. Kilby won the 2000 Nobel Prize in physics for his part in the invention of the integrated circuit.

However, Kilby&#x27;s invention was not a true monolithic integrated circuit chip since it had external gold-wire connections, which would have made it difficult to mass-produce. Half a year after Kilby, Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor invented the first true monolithic IC chip. More practical than Kilby&#x27;s implementation, Noyce&#x27;s chip was made of silicon, whereas Kilby&#x27;s was made of germanium, and Noyce&#x27;s was fabricated using the planar process, developed in early 1959 by his colleague Jean Hoerni and included the critical on-chip aluminum interconnecting lines. Modern IC chips are based on Noyce&#x27;s monolithic IC, rather than Kilby&#x27;s.

NASA&#x27;s Apollo Program was the largest single consumer of integrated circuits between 1961 and 1965.

=== TTL integrated circuits ===
Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) was developed by James L. Buie in the early 1960s at TRW Inc. TTL became the dominant integrated circuit technology during the 1970s to early 1980s.

Dozens of TTL integrated circuits were a standard method of construction for the processors of minicomputers and mainframe computers. Computers such as IBM 360 mainframes, PDP-11 minicomputers and the desktop Datapoint 2200 were built from bipolar integrated circuits, either TTL or the even faster emitter-coupled logic (ECL).

=== MOS integrated circuits ===

Nearly all modern IC chips are metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuits, built from MOSFETs (metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistors). The MOSFET invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960, made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits. In contrast to bipolar transistors which required a number of steps for the p–n junction isolation of transistors on a chip, MOSFETs required no such steps but could be easily isolated from each other. Its advantage for integrated circuits was pointed out by Dawon Kahng in 1961. The list of IEEE milestones includes the first integrated circuit by Kilby in 1958, Hoerni&#x27;s planar process and Noyce&#x27;s planar IC in 1959.

The earliest experimental MOS IC to be fabricated was a 16-transistor chip built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962. General Microelectronics later introduced the first commercial MOS integrated circuit in 1964, a 120-transistor shift register developed by Robert Norman. By 1964, MOS chips had reached higher transistor density and lower manufacturing costs than bipolar chips. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore&#x27;s law, leading to large-scale integration (LSI) with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s.
Following the development of the self-aligned gate (silicon-gate) MOSFET by Robert Kerwin, Donald Klein and John Sarace at Bell Labs in 1967, the first silicon-gate MOS IC technology with self-aligned gates, the basis of all modern CMOS integrated circuits, was developed at Fairchild Semiconductor by Federico Faggin in 1968. The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor could be contained on a single MOS LSI chip. This led to the inventions of the microprocessor and the microcontroller by the early 1970s. During the early 1970s, MOS integrated circuit technology enabled the very large-scale integration (VLSI) of more than 10,000 transistors on a single chip.

At first, MOS-based computers only made sense when high density was required, such as aerospace and pocket calculators. Computers built entirely from TTL, such as the 1970 Datapoint 2200, were much faster and more powerful than single-chip MOS microprocessors such as the 1972 Intel 8008 until the early 1980s.

Advances in IC technology, primarily smaller features and larger chips, have allowed the number of MOS transistors in an integrated circuit to double every two years, a trend known as Moore&#x27;s law. Moore originally stated it would double every year, but he went on to change the claim to every two years in 1975. This increased capacity has been used to decrease cost and increase functionality. In general, as the feature size shrinks, almost every aspect of an IC&#x27;s operation improves. The cost per transistor and the switching power consumption per transistor goes down, while the memory capacity and speed go up, through the relationships defined by Dennard scaling (MOSFET scaling). Because speed, capacity, and power consumption gains are apparent to the end user, there is fierce competition among the manufacturers to use finer geometries. Over the years, transistor sizes have decreased from tens of microns in the early 1970s to 10 nanometers in 2017 with a corresponding million-fold increase in transistors per unit area. As of 2016, typical chip areas range from a few square millimeters to around 600 mm2, with up to 25 million transistors per mm2.

The expected shrinking of feature sizes and the needed progress in related areas was forecast for many years by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). The final ITRS was issued in 2016, and it is being replaced by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems.

Initially, ICs were strictly electronic devices. The success of ICs has led to the integration of other technologies, in an attempt to obtain the same advantages of small size and low cost. These technologies include mechanical devices, optics, and sensors. 
* Charge-coupled devices, and the closely related active-pixel sensors, are chips that are sensitive to light. They have largely replaced photographic film in scientific, medical, and consumer applications. Billions of these devices are now produced each year for applications such as cellphones, tablets, and digital cameras. This sub-field of ICs won the Nobel Prize in 2009. 
* Very small mechanical devices driven by electricity can be integrated onto chips, a technology known as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). These devices were developed in the late 1980s and are used in a variety of commercial and military applications. Examples include DLP projectors, inkjet printers, and accelerometers and MEMS gyroscopes used to deploy automobile airbags.
* Since the early 2000s, the integration of optical functionality (optical computing) into silicon chips has been actively pursued in both academic research and in industry resulting in the successful commercialization of silicon based integrated optical transceivers combining optical devices (modulators, detectors, routing) with CMOS based electronics. Photonic integrated circuits that use light such as Lightelligence&#x27;s PACE (Photonic Arithmetic Computing Engine) also being developed, using the emerging field of physics known as photonics.
* Integrated circuits are also being developed for sensor applications in medical implants or other bioelectronic devices. Special sealing techniques have to be applied in such biogenic environments to avoid corrosion or biodegradation of the exposed semiconductor materials.
, the vast majority of all transistors are MOSFETs fabricated in a single layer on one side of a chip of silicon in a flat two-dimensional planar process. Researchers have produced prototypes of several promising alternatives, such as:
* various approaches to stacking several layers of transistors to make a three-dimensional integrated circuit (3DIC), such as through-silicon via, &quot;monolithic 3D&quot;, stacked wire bonding, and other methodologies.
* transistors built from other materials: graphene transistors, molybdenite transistors, carbon nanotube field-effect transistor, gallium nitride transistor, transistor-like nanowire electronic devices, organic field-effect transistor, etc.
* fabricating transistors over the entire surface of a small sphere of silicon.
* modifications to the substrate, typically to make &quot;flexible transistors&quot; for a flexible display or other flexible electronics, possibly leading to a roll-away computer.

As it becomes more difficult to manufacture ever smaller transistors, companies are using multi-chip modules/chiplets, three-dimensional integrated circuits, package on package, High Bandwidth Memory and through-silicon vias with die stacking to increase performance and reduce size, without having to reduce the size of the transistors. Such techniques are collectively known as advanced packaging. Advanced packaging is mainly divided into 2.5D and 3D packaging. 2.5D describes approaches such as multi-chip modules while 3D describes approaches where dies are stacked in one way or another, such as package on package and high bandwidth memory. All approaches involve 2 or more dies in a single package. Alternatively, approaches such as 3D NAND stack multiple layers on a single die. A technique has been demonstrated to include microfluidic cooling on integrated circuits, to improve cooling performance as well as peltier thermoelectric coolers on solder bumps, or thermal solder bumps used exclusively for heat dissipation, used in flip-chip.

==Design==

The cost of designing and developing a complex integrated circuit is quite high, normally in the multiple tens of millions of dollars. Therefore, it only makes economic sense to produce integrated circuit products with high production volume, so the non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs are spread across typically millions of production units.

Modern semiconductor chips have billions of components, and are far too complex to be designed by hand. Software tools to help the designer are essential. Electronic design automation (EDA), also referred to as electronic computer-aided design (ECAD), is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems, including integrated circuits. The tools work together in a design flow that engineers use to design, verify, and analyze entire semiconductor chips. Some of the latest EDA tools use artificial intelligence (AI) to help engineers save time and improve chip performance.

== Types ==

Integrated circuits can be broadly classified into analog, digital and mixed signal, consisting of analog and digital signaling on the same IC.

Digital integrated circuits can contain billions of logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and other circuits in a few square millimeters. The small size of these circuits allows high speed, low power dissipation, and reduced manufacturing cost compared with board-level integration. These digital ICs, typically microprocessors, DSPs, and microcontrollers, use boolean algebra to process &quot;one&quot; and &quot;zero&quot; signals.
Among the most advanced integrated circuits are the microprocessors or &quot;cores&quot;, used in personal computers, cell-phones, etc. Several cores may be integrated together in a single IC or chip. Digital memory chips and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are examples of other families of integrated circuits.

In the 1980s, programmable logic devices were developed. These devices contain circuits whose logical function and connectivity can be programmed by the user, rather than being fixed by the integrated circuit manufacturer. This allows a chip to be programmed to do various LSI-type functions such as logic gates, adders and registers. Programmability comes in various forms – devices that can be programmed only once, devices that can be erased and then re-programmed using UV light, devices that can be (re)programmed using flash memory, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) which can be programmed at any time, including during operation. Current FPGAs can (as of 2016) implement the equivalent of millions of gates and operate at frequencies up to 1 GHz.

Analog ICs, such as sensors, power management circuits, and operational amplifiers (op-amps), process continuous signals, and perform analog functions such as amplification, active filtering, demodulation, and mixing.

ICs can combine analog and digital circuits on a chip to create functions such as analog-to-digital converters and digital-to-analog converters. Such mixed-signal circuits offer smaller size and lower cost, but must account for signal interference. Prior to the late 1990s, radios could not be fabricated in the same low-cost CMOS processes as microprocessors. But since 1998, radio chips have been developed using RF CMOS processes. Examples include Intel&#x27;s DECT cordless phone, or 802.11 (Wi-Fi) chips created by Atheros and other companies.

Modern electronic component distributors often further sub-categorize integrated circuits:
* Digital ICs are categorized as logic ICs (such as microprocessors and microcontrollers), memory chips (such as MOS memory and floating-gate memory), interface ICs (level shifters, serializer/deserializer, etc.), power management ICs, and programmable devices.
* Analog ICs are categorized as linear integrated circuits and RF circuits (radio frequency circuits).
* Mixed-signal integrated circuits are categorized as data acquisition ICs (including A/D converters, D/A converters, digital potentiometers), clock/timing ICs, switched capacitor (SC) circuits, and RF CMOS circuits.
* Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) are categorized into through-silicon via (TSV) ICs and Cu-Cu connection ICs.

=== Fabrication ===


The semiconductors of the periodic table of the chemical elements were identified as the most likely materials for a &quot;solid-state vacuum tube&quot;. Starting with copper oxide, proceeding to germanium, then silicon, the materials were systematically studied in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, monocrystalline silicon is the main substrate used for ICs although some III-V compounds of the periodic table such as gallium arsenide are used for specialized applications like LEDs, lasers, solar cells and the highest-speed integrated circuits. It took decades to perfect methods of creating crystals with minimal defects in semiconducting materials&#x27; crystal structure.

Semiconductor ICs are fabricated in a planar process which includes three key process steps photolithography, deposition (such as chemical vapor deposition), and etching. The main process steps are supplemented by doping and cleaning. More recent or high-performance ICs may instead use multi-gate FinFET or GAAFET transistors instead of planar ones, starting at the 22 nm node (Intel) or 16/14 nm nodes.

Mono-crystal silicon wafers are used in most applications (or for special applications, other semiconductors such as gallium arsenide are used). The wafer need not be entirely silicon. Photolithography is used to mark different areas of the substrate to be doped or to have polysilicon, insulators or metal (typically aluminium or copper) tracks deposited on them. Dopants are impurities intentionally introduced to a semiconductor to modulate its electronic properties. Doping is the process of adding dopants to a semiconductor material.
* Integrated circuits are composed of many overlapping layers, each defined by photolithography, and normally shown in different colors. Some layers mark where various dopants are diffused into the substrate (called diffusion layers), some define where additional ions are implanted (implant layers), some define the conductors (doped polysilicon or metal layers), and some define the connections between the conducting layers (via or contact layers). All components are constructed from a specific combination of these layers.
* In a self-aligned CMOS process, a transistor is formed wherever the gate layer (polysilicon or metal) crosses a diffusion layer (this is called &quot;the self-aligned gate&quot;).
* Capacitive structures, in form very much like the parallel conducting plates of a traditional electrical capacitor, are formed according to the area of the &quot;plates&quot;, with insulating material between the plates. Capacitors of a wide range of sizes are common on ICs.
* Meandering stripes of varying lengths are sometimes used to form on-chip resistors, though most logic circuits do not need any resistors. The ratio of the length of the resistive structure to its width, combined with its sheet resistivity, determines the resistance.
* More rarely, inductive structures can be built as tiny on-chip coils, or simulated by gyrators.

Since a CMOS device only draws current on the &quot;transition&quot; between logic states, CMOS devices consume much less current than bipolar junction transistor devices.

A random-access memory is the most regular type of integrated circuit; the highest density devices are thus memories; but even a microprocessor will have memory on the chip. (See the regular array structure at the bottom of the first image.) Although the structures are intricate – with widths which have been shrinking for decades – the layers remain much thinner than the device widths. The layers of material are fabricated much like a photographic process, although light waves in the visible spectrum cannot be used to &quot;expose&quot; a layer of material, as they would be too large for the features. Thus photons of higher frequencies (typically ultraviolet) are used to create the patterns for each layer. Because each feature is so small, electron microscopes are essential tools for a process engineer who might be debugging a fabrication process.

Each device is tested before packaging using automated test equipment (ATE), in a process known as wafer testing, or wafer probing. The wafer is then cut into rectangular blocks, each of which is called a &quot;die&quot;. Each good die (plural &quot;dice&quot;, &quot;dies&quot;, or &quot;die&quot;) is then connected into a package using aluminium (or gold) bond wires which are thermosonically bonded to &quot;pads&quot;, usually found around the edge of the die. Thermosonic bonding was first introduced by A. Coucoulas which provided a reliable means of forming these vital electrical connections to the outside world. After packaging, the devices go through final testing on the same or similar ATE used during wafer probing. Industrial CT scanning can also be used. Test cost can account for over 25% of the cost of fabrication on lower-cost products, but can be negligible on low-yielding, larger, or higher-cost devices.

, a fabrication facility (commonly known as a &quot;semiconductor fab&quot;) can cost over US$12 billion to construct. The cost of a fabrication facility rises over time because of increased complexity of new products; this is known as Rock&#x27;s law. Such a facility features:
* The wafers up to 300 mm in diameter (wider than a common dinner plate).
* , 5 nm transistors.
* Copper interconnects where copper wiring replaces aluminum for interconnects.
* Low-κ dielectric insulators.
* Silicon on insulator (SOI).
* Strained silicon in a process used by IBM known as Strained silicon directly on insulator (SSDOI).
* Multigate devices such as tri-gate transistors.

ICs can be manufactured either in-house by integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) or using the foundry model. IDMs are vertically integrated companies (like Intel and Samsung) that design, manufacture and sell their own ICs, and may offer design and/or manufacturing (foundry) services to other companies (the latter often to fabless companies). In the foundry model, fabless companies (like Nvidia) only design and sell ICs and outsource all manufacturing to pure play foundries such as TSMC. These foundries may offer IC design services.

=== Packaging ===

The earliest integrated circuits were packaged in ceramic flat packs, which continued to be used by the military for their reliability and small size for many years. Commercial circuit packaging quickly moved to the dual in-line package (DIP), first in ceramic and later in plastic, which is commonly cresol-formaldehyde-novolac. In the 1980s pin counts of VLSI circuits exceeded the practical limit for DIP packaging, leading to pin grid array (PGA) and leadless chip carrier (LCC) packages. Surface mount packaging appeared in the early 1980s and became popular in the late 1980s, using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull-wing or J-lead, as exemplified by the small-outline integrated circuit (SOIC) package – a carrier which occupies an area about 30–50% less than an equivalent DIP and is typically 70% thinner. This package has &quot;gull wing&quot; leads protruding from the two long sides and a lead spacing of 0.050 inches.

In the late 1990s, plastic quad flat pack (PQFP) and thin small-outline package (TSOP) packages became the most common for high pin count devices, though PGA packages are still used for high-end microprocessors.

Ball grid array (BGA) packages have existed since the 1970s. Flip-chip Ball Grid Array packages, which allow for a much higher pin count than other package types, were developed in the 1990s. In an FCBGA package, the die is mounted upside-down (flipped) and connects to the package balls via a package substrate that is similar to a printed-circuit board rather than by wires. FCBGA packages allow an array of input-output signals (called Area-I/O) to be distributed over the entire die rather than being confined to the die periphery. BGA devices have the advantage of not needing a dedicated socket but are much harder to replace in case of device failure.

Intel transitioned away from PGA to land grid array (LGA) and BGA beginning in 2004, with the last PGA socket released in 2014 for mobile platforms. , AMD uses PGA packages on mainstream desktop processors, BGA packages on mobile processors, and high-end desktop and server microprocessors use LGA packages.

Electrical signals leaving the die must pass through the material electrically connecting the die to the package, through the conductive traces (paths) in the package, through the leads connecting the package to the conductive traces on the printed circuit board. The materials and structures used in the path these electrical signals must travel have very different electrical properties, compared to those that travel to different parts of the same die. As a result, they require special design techniques to ensure the signals are not corrupted, and much more electric power than signals confined to the die itself.

When multiple dies are put in one package, the result is a system in package, abbreviated . A multi-chip module (), is created by combining multiple dies on a small substrate often made of ceramic. The distinction between a large MCM and a small printed circuit board is sometimes fuzzy.

Packaged integrated circuits are usually large enough to include identifying information. Four common sections are the manufacturer&#x27;s name or logo, the part number, a part production batch number and serial number, and a four-digit date-code to identify when the chip was manufactured. Extremely small surface-mount technology parts often bear only a number used in a manufacturer&#x27;s lookup table to find the integrated circuit&#x27;s characteristics.

The manufacturing date is commonly represented as a two-digit year followed by a two-digit week code, such that a part bearing the code 8341 was manufactured in week 41 of 1983, or approximately in October 1983.

== Intellectual property ==
The possibility of copying by photographing each layer of an integrated circuit and preparing photomasks for its production on the basis of the photographs obtained is a reason for the introduction of legislation for the protection of layout designs. The US Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 established intellectual property protection for photomasks used to produce integrated circuits.

A diplomatic conference held at Washington, D.C., in 1989 adopted a Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits, also called the Washington Treaty or IPIC Treaty. The treaty is currently not in force, but was partially integrated into the TRIPS agreement.

There are several United States patents connected to the integrated circuit, which include patents by J.S. Kilby , , and by R.F. Stewart .

National laws protecting IC layout designs have been adopted in a number of countries, including Japan, the EC, the UK, Australia, and Korea. The UK enacted the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988, c. 48, § 213, after it initially took the position that its copyright law fully protected chip topographies. See British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.

Criticisms of inadequacy of the UK copyright approach as perceived by the US chip industry are summarized in further chip rights developments.

Australia passed the Circuit Layouts Act of 1989 as a &quot;sui generis&quot; form of chip protection. Korea passed the &quot;Act Concerning the Layout-Design of Semiconductor Integrated Circuits&quot; in 1992.

== Generations ==
In the early days of simple integrated circuits, the technology&#x27;s large scale limited each chip to only a few transistors, and the low degree of integration meant the design process was relatively simple. Manufacturing yields were also quite low by today&#x27;s standards. As metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology progressed, millions and then billions of MOS transistors could be placed on one chip, and good designs required thorough planning, giving rise to the field of electronic design automation, or EDA.
Some SSI and MSI chips, like discrete transistors, are still mass-produced, both to maintain old equipment and build new devices that require only a few gates. The 7400 series of TTL chips, for example, has become a de facto standard and remains in production.

===Small-scale integration (SSI) ===

The first integrated circuits contained only a few transistors. Early digital circuits containing tens of transistors provided a few logic gates, and early linear ICs such as the Plessey SL201 or the Philips TAA320 had as few as two transistors. The number of transistors in an integrated circuit has increased dramatically since then. The term &quot;large scale integration&quot; (LSI) was first used by IBM scientist Rolf Landauer when describing the theoretical concept; that term gave rise to the terms &quot;small-scale integration&quot; (SSI), &quot;medium-scale integration&quot; (MSI), &quot;very-large-scale integration&quot; (VLSI), and &quot;ultra-large-scale integration&quot; (ULSI). The early integrated circuits were SSI.

SSI circuits were crucial to early aerospace projects, and aerospace projects helped inspire development of the technology. Both the Minuteman missile and Apollo program needed lightweight digital computers for their inertial guidance systems. Although the Apollo Guidance Computer led and motivated integrated-circuit technology, it was the Minuteman missile that forced it into mass-production. The Minuteman missile program and various other United States Navy programs accounted for the total $4 million integrated circuit market in 1962, and by 1968, U.S. Government spending on space and defense still accounted for 37% of the $312 million total production.

The demand by the U.S. Government supported the nascent integrated circuit market until costs fell enough to allow IC firms to penetrate the industrial market and eventually the consumer market. The average price per integrated circuit dropped from $50 in 1962 to $2.33 in 1968. Integrated circuits began to appear in consumer products by the turn of the 1970s decade. A typical application was FM inter-carrier sound processing in television receivers.

The first application MOS chips were small-scale integration (SSI) chips. Following Mohamed M. Atalla&#x27;s proposal of the MOS integrated circuit chip in 1960, the earliest experimental MOS chip to be fabricated was a 16-transistor chip built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962. The first practical application of MOS SSI chips was for NASA satellites.

===Medium-scale integration (MSI) ===
The next step in the development of integrated circuits introduced devices which contained hundreds of transistors on each chip, called &quot;medium-scale integration&quot; (MSI).

MOSFET scaling technology made it possible to build high-density chips. By 1964, MOS chips had reached higher transistor density and lower manufacturing costs than bipolar chips.

In 1964, Frank Wanlass demonstrated a single-chip 16-bit shift register he designed, with a then-incredible 120 MOS transistors on a single chip. The same year, General Microelectronics introduced the first commercial MOS integrated circuit chip, consisting of 120 p-channel MOS transistors. It was a 20-bit shift register, developed by Robert Norman and Frank Wanlass. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore&#x27;s law, leading to chips with hundreds of MOSFETs on a chip by the late 1960s.

===Large-scale integration (LSI) ===
Further development, driven by the same MOSFET scaling technology and economic factors, led to &quot;large-scale integration&quot; (LSI) by the mid-1970s, with tens of thousands of transistors per chip.

The masks used to process and manufacture SSI, MSI and early LSI and VLSI devices (such as the microprocessors of the early 1970s) were mostly created by hand, often using Rubylith-tape or similar. For large or complex ICs (such as memories or processors), this was often done by specially hired professionals in charge of circuit layout, placed under the supervision of a team of engineers, who would also, along with the circuit designers, inspect and verify the correctness and completeness of each mask.

Integrated circuits such as 1K-bit RAMs, calculator chips, and the first microprocessors, that began to be manufactured in moderate quantities in the early 1970s, had under 4,000 transistors. True LSI circuits, approaching 10,000 transistors, began to be produced around 1974, for computer main memories and second-generation microprocessors.

=== Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) ===

&quot;Very-large-scale integration&quot; (VLSI) is a development that started with hundreds of thousands of transistors in the early 1980s. As of 2023, maximum transistor counts continue to grow beyond 5.3 trillion transistors per chip.

Multiple developments were required to achieve this increased density. Manufacturers moved to smaller MOSFET design rules and cleaner fabrication facilities. The path of process improvements was summarized by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), which has since been succeeded by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Electronic design tools improved, making it practical to finish designs in a reasonable time. The more energy-efficient CMOS replaced NMOS and PMOS, avoiding a prohibitive increase in power consumption. The complexity and density of modern VLSI devices made it no longer feasible to check the masks or do the original design by hand. Instead, engineers use tools to perform most functional verification work.

In 1986, one-megabit random-access memory (RAM) chips were introduced, containing more than one million transistors. Microprocessor chips passed the million-transistor mark in 1989, and the billion-transistor mark in 2005. The trend continues largely unabated, with chips introduced in 2007 containing tens of billions of memory transistors.

=== ULSI, WSI, SoC and 3D-IC ===

To reflect further growth of the complexity, the term &quot;ULSI&quot; that stands for &quot;ultra-large-scale integration&quot; was proposed for chips of more than 1 million transistors.

Wafer-scale integration (WSI) is a means of building very large integrated circuits that uses an entire silicon wafer to produce a single &quot;super-chip&quot;. Through a combination of large size and reduced packaging, WSI could lead to dramatically reduced costs for some systems, notably massively parallel supercomputers. The name is taken from the term Very-Large-Scale Integration, the current state of the art when WSI was being developed.

A system-on-a-chip (SoC or SOC) is an integrated circuit in which all the components needed for a computer or other system are included on a single chip. The design of such a device can be complex and costly, and whilst performance benefits can be had from integrating all needed components on one die, the cost of licensing and developing a one-die machine still outweigh having separate devices. With appropriate licensing, these drawbacks are offset by lower manufacturing and assembly costs and by a greatly reduced power budget: because signals among the components are kept on-die, much less power is required (see Packaging). Further, signal sources and destinations are physically closer on die, reducing the length of wiring and therefore latency, transmission power costs and waste heat from communication between modules on the same chip. This has led to an exploration of so-called Network-on-Chip (NoC) devices, which apply system-on-chip design methodologies to digital communication networks as opposed to traditional bus architectures.

A three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) has two or more layers of active electronic components that are integrated both vertically and horizontally into a single circuit. Communication between layers uses on-die signaling, so power consumption is much lower than in equivalent separate circuits. Judicious use of short vertical wires can substantially reduce overall wire length for faster operation.

== Silicon labeling and graffiti ==
To allow identification during production, most silicon chips will have a serial number in one corner. It is also common to add the manufacturer&#x27;s logo. Ever since ICs were created, some chip designers have used the silicon surface area for surreptitious, non-functional images or words. These artistic additions, often created with great attention to detail, showcase the designers&#x27; creativity and add a touch of personality to otherwise utilitarian components. These are sometimes referred to as chip art, silicon art, silicon graffiti or silicon doodling.

<text>The IBM 3270 is a family of block oriented display and printer computer terminals introduced by IBM in 1971 and normally used to communicate with IBM mainframes. The 3270 was the successor to the IBM 2260 display terminal. Due to the text color on the original models, these terminals are informally known as &quot;green screen&quot; terminals. Unlike a character-oriented terminal, the 3270 minimizes the number of I/O interrupts required by transferring large blocks of data known as data streams, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using coaxial cable.

IBM no longer manufactures 3270 terminals, but the IBM 3270 protocol is still commonly used via TN3270 clients, 3270 terminal emulation or web interfaces to access mainframe-based applications, which are sometimes referred to as &quot;green screen applications&quot;.

==Principles==
The 3270 series was designed to connect with mainframe computers, often at a remote location, using the technology then available in the early 1970s. The main goal of the system was to maximize the number of terminals that could be used on a single mainframe. To do this, the 3270 was designed to minimize the amount of data transmitted, and minimize the frequency of interrupts to the mainframe. By ensuring the CPU is not interrupted at every keystroke, a 1970s-era IBM 3033 mainframe fitted with only 16 MB of main memory was able to support up to 17,500 3270 terminals under CICS.
Most 3270 devices are &quot;clustered&quot;, with one or more displays or printers connected to a &quot;control unit&quot; (the 3275 and 3276 included an integrated control unit). Originally devices were connected to the control unit over coaxial cable; later Token Ring, twisted pair, or Ethernet connections were available. A &quot;local&quot; control unit attaches directly to the channel of a nearby mainframe. A &quot;remote&quot; control unit is connected to a communications line by a modem. Remote 3270 controllers are frequently &quot;multi-dropped&quot;, with multiple control units on a line.

IBM 3270 devices are connected to a 3299 multiplexer or to the cluster controller, e.g., 3271, 3272, 3274, 3174, using 93ohm RG-62 coaxial cables in a point-to-point configuration with one dedicated cable per terminal. Data is sent with a bit rate of 2.3587 Mbit/s using a slightly modified differential Manchester encoding. Cable runs of up to are supported, although IBM documents routinely stated the maximum supported coax cable length was . Originally devices were equipped with BNC connectors, which were later replaced with special &quot;dual-purpose connectors&quot; (&quot;DPCs&quot;) supporting the IBM shielded twisted-pair cabling system without the need for red baluns.

In a data stream, both text and control (or formatting functions) are interspersed allowing an entire screen to be painted as a single output operation. The concept of formatting in these devices allows the screen to be divided into fields (clusters of contiguous character cells) for which numerous field attributes, e.g., color, highlighting, character set, and protection from modification, can be set. A field attribute occupies a physical location on the screen that also determines the beginning and end of a field. There are also character attributes associated with individual screen locations.

Using a technique known as &quot;read modified&quot;, a single transmission back to the mainframe can contain the changes from any number of formatted fields that have been modified, but without sending any unmodified fields or static data. This technique enhances the terminal throughput of the CPU, and minimizes the data transmitted. Some users familiar with character interrupt-driven terminal interfaces find this technique unusual. There is also a read buffer capability that transfers the entire content of the 3270-screen buffer including field attributes. This is mainly used for debugging purposes to preserve the application program screen contents while replacing it, temporarily, with debugging information.

Early 3270s offered three types of keyboards. The &quot;typewriter keyboard&quot; came in both a 66 key version, with no programmed function (PF) keys, and a 78 key version with twelve. Both versions had two &quot;Program Attention&quot; (PA) keys. The &quot;data entry keyboard&quot; had five PF keys and two PA keys. The &quot;operator console keyboard&quot; had twelve PF keys and two PA keys. Later 3270s had an Attention key, a Cursor Select key, a System Request key, twenty-four PF keys and three PA keys. There was also a TEST REQ key. When one of these keys is pressed, it will cause its control unit to generate an I/O interrupt to the host computer and present an &quot;Attention ID&quot; (AID) identifying which key was pressed. Application program functions such as termination, page-up, page-down, or help can be invoked by a single key press, thereby reducing the load on very busy processors.

A downside to this approach was that vi-like behavior, responding to individual keystrokes, was not possible. For the same reason, a port of Lotus 1-2-3 to mainframes with 3279 screens did not meet with success because its programmers were not able to properly adapt the spreadsheet&#x27;s user interface to a screen at a time rather than character at a time device. But end-user responsiveness was arguably more predictable with 3270, something users appreciated.

==Applications==
Following its introduction the 3270 and compatibles were by far the most commonly used terminals on IBM System/370 and successor systems. IBM and third-party software that included an interactive component took for granted the presence of 3270 terminals and provided a set of ISPF panels and supporting programs.

Conversational Monitor System (CMS) in VM has support for the 3270 continuing to z/VM.

Time Sharing Option (TSO) in OS/360 and successors has line mode command line support and also has facilities for full screen applications, e.g., ISPF.

Device Independent Display Operator Console Support (DIDOCS) in Multiple Console Support (MCS) for OS/360 and successors supports 3270 devices and, in fact, MCS in current versions of MVS no longer supports line mode, 2250 or 2260 devices.

The SPF and &quot;Program Development Facility&quot; (ISPF/PDF) editors for MVS and VM/SP (ISPF/PDF was available for VM, but little used) and the XEDIT editors for VM/SP through z/VM make extensive use of 3270 features.

Customer Information Control System (CICS) has support for 3270 panels. Indeed, from the early 1970s on, CICS applications were often written for the 3270.

The online editing and job submission environment Source Program Maintenance Online II (SPM) was oriented around the 3270.

Various versions of Wylbur have support for 3270, including support for full-screen applications.

McGill University&#x27;s MUSIC/SP operating system provided support for 3270 terminals and applications, including a full-screen text editor, a menu system, and a PANEL facility to create 3270 full-screen applications. 

The modified data tag is well suited to converting formatted, structured punched card input onto the 3270 display device. With the appropriate programming, any batch program that uses formatted, structured card input can be layered onto a 3270 terminal.

IBM&#x27;s OfficeVision office productivity software enjoyed great success with 3270 interaction because of its design understanding. And for many years the PROFS calendar was the most commonly displayed screen on office terminals around the world.

A version of the WordPerfect word processor ported to System/370 was designed for the 3270 architecture.

== SNA ==
3270 devices can be a part of an SNA – System Network Architecture network or non-SNA network. If the controllers are SNA connected, they appear to SNA as PU – Physical Unit type 2.0 (PU2.1 for APPN) nodes typically with LU – Logical Unit type 1, 2, and 3 devices connected. Local, channel attached, controllers are controlled by VTAM – Virtual Telecommunications Access Method. Remote controllers are controlled by the NCP – Network Control Program in the Front End Processor i.e. 3705, 3720, 3725, 3745, and VTAM.

==Third parties==
One of the first groups to write and provide operating system support for the 3270 and its early predecessors was the University of Michigan, who created the Michigan Terminal System in order for the hardware to be useful outside of the manufacturer. MTS was the default OS at Michigan for many years, and was still used at Michigan well into the 1990s.
Many manufacturers, such as GTE, Hewlett-Packard, Honeywell/Incoterm Div, Memorex, ITT Courier, McData, Harris, Alfaskop and Teletype/AT&amp;T created 3270 compatible terminals, or adapted ASCII terminals such as the HP 2640 series to have a similar block-mode capability that would transmit a screen at a time, with some form validation capability. The industry distinguished between &#x27;system compatible&#x27; and &#x27;plug compatible&#x27; controllers, where &#x27;system compatibility&#x27; meant that the third-party system was compatible with the 3270 data stream terminated in the unit, but &#x27;plug compatible&#x27; equipment was also compatible at the coax level, thereby allowing IBM terminals to be connected to a third-party controller or vice versa. Modern applications are sometimes built upon legacy 3270 applications, using software utilities to capture (screen scrape) screens and transfer the data to web pages or GUI interfaces.

In the early 1990s a popular solution to link PCs with the mainframes was the Irma board, an expansion card that plugged into a PC and connected to the controller through a coaxial cable. 3270 simulators for IRMA and similar adapters typically provide file transfers between the PC and the mainframe using the same protocol as the IBM 3270 PC.

==Models==

The IBM 3270 display terminal subsystem consists of displays, printers and controllers.
Optional features for the 3275 and 3277 are the &quot;selector-pen&quot;, ASCII rather than EBCDIC character set, an audible alarm, and a keylock for the keyboard. A &quot;keyboard numeric lock&quot; was available and will lock the keyboard if the operator attempts to enter non-numeric data into a field defined as numeric. Later an &quot;Operator Identification Card Reader&quot; was added which could read information encoded on a magnetic stripe card.

===Displays===
Generally, 3277 models allow only upper-case input, except for the mixed EBCDIC/APL or &quot;text&quot; keyboards, which have lower case. Lower-case capability and dead keys were available as an RPQ (&quot;Request Price Quotation&quot;); these were added to the later 3278 &amp; 3279 models.

A version of the IBM PC called the 3270 PC, released in October 1983, includes 3270 terminal emulation. Later, the 3270 PC/G (graphics), 3270 PC/GX (extended graphics), 3270 Personal Computer AT, 3270 PC AT/G (graphics) and 3270 PC AT/GX (extended graphics) followed.

====CUT vs. DFT====
There are two types of 3270 displays in respect to where the 3270 data stream terminates. For CUT (Control Unit Terminal) displays, the stream terminates in the display controller, the controller instructs the display to move the cursor, position a character, etc. EBCDIC is translated by the controller into &#x27;3270 Character Set&#x27;, and keyboard scan-codes from the terminal, read by the controller through a poll, is translated by the controller into EBCDIC. For DFT (Distributed Function Terminal) type displays, most of the 3270 data stream is forwarded to the display by the controller. The display interprets the 3270 protocol itself.

In addition to passing the 3270 data stream directly to the terminal, allowing for features like EAB — Extended Attributes, Graphics, etc., DFT also enabled multi sessions (up to 5 simultaneous), featured in the 3290 and 3194 multisession displays. This feature was also widely used in 2nd generation 3270 terminal emulation software.

The MLT — Multiple Logical Terminals feature of the 3174 controller also enabled multiple sessions from a CUT type terminal.

====3277====
*3277 model 1: 40×12 terminal
*3277 model 2: 80×24 terminal, the biggest success of all
*3277 GA: a 3277 with an RS232C I/O, often used to drive a Tektronix 4013 or 4015 graphic screen (monochrome)
====3278====
*3278 models 1–5: next-generation, with accented characters and dead keys in countries that needed them
** model 1: 80x12
** model 2: 80×24
** model 2A: 80x24 (console) with 4 lines reserved
** model 3: 80×32 or 80x24 (switchable)
** model 4: 80×43 or 80x24 (switchable)
** model 5: 132×27 or 80×24 (switchable)
* Extended Highlighting: ability to set highlighting attributes on individual characters as well as on fields. For the 3278 that includes:
** blinking
** character set
** reverse video
** underscored
* Programmed Symbols {PS): programmable characters; able to display monochrome graphics

The 3278, along with the 3279 color display and the 3287 printer, introduced the &quot;Extended Display Stream&quot; (EDS) as the framework for new features.

====3279====

The IBM 3279 was IBM&#x27;s first color terminal. IBM initially announced four models, and later added a fifth model for use as a processor console.
* Models
** model 2A: 80-24 base color
** model 2B: 80-24 extended color 
** model 2C: 80-24 base color (console) with 4 lines reserved
** model 3A: 80-32 base color
** model 3B: 80-32 extended color 
** model S3G: 80-32 extended color with programmed symbol set graphics
;Base color: In base color mode the protection and intensity field attributes determine the color:
;Extended color: In extended color mode the color field and character attributes determine the color as one of
* Neutral (White) 
* Red 
* Blue 
* Green 
* Pink 
* Yellow 
* Turquoise

The 3279 was introduced in 1979. The 3279 was widely used as an IBM mainframe terminal before PCs became commonly used for the purpose. It was part of the 3270 series, using the 3270 data stream. Terminals could be connected to a 3274 controller, either channel connected to an IBM mainframe or linked via an SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control) link. In the Systems Network Architecture (SNA) protocol these terminals were logical unit type 2 (LU2). The basic models 2A and 3A used red, green for input fields, and blue and white for output fields. However, the models 2B and 3B supported seven colors, and when equipped with the optional Programmed Symbol Set feature had a loadable character set that could be used to show graphics. The Programmed Symbol Set feature could be added in the field, and was standard in the model S3G.

The IBM 3279 with its graphics software support, Graphical Data Display Manager (GDDM), was designed at IBM&#x27;s Hursley Development Laboratory, near Winchester, England.

====3290====

The 3290 Information Panel a 17&quot;, amber monochrome plasma display unit announced March 8, 1983, capable of displaying in various modes, including four independent 3278 model 2 terminals, or a single 160×62 terminal; it also supports partitioning. The 3290 supports graphics through the use of &quot;programmed symbols&quot;. A 3290 application can divide its screen area up into as many as 16 separate &quot;explicit partitions&quot; (logical screens).

The 3290 is a Distributed Function Terminal (DFT) and requires that the controller do a downstream load (DSL) of microcode from floppy or hard disk.

====317x====
*3178: lower cost terminal (1983)
*3179: low cost color terminal announced March 20, 1984.

====3180====
The 3180 was a monochrome display, introduced on March 20, 1984, that the user could configure for several different basic and extended display modes; all of the basic modes have a primary screen size of 24x80. Modes 2 and 2+ have a secondary size of 24x80, 3 and 3+ have a secondary size of 32x80, 4 and 4+ have a secondary size of 43x80 and 5 and 5+ have a secondary size of 27x132. An application can override the primary and alternate screen sizes for the extended mode. The 3180 also supported a single explicit partition that could be reconfigured under application control.

====3191====
The IBM 3191 Display Station is an economical monochrome CRT. Models A and B are 1920 characters 12-inch CRTs. Models D, E and L are 1920 or 2560 character 14-inch CRTs.

====3192====
* Model C provides a 7-color 14 inch CRT with 80x24 or 80x32 characters
* Model D provides a green monochrome 15 inch CRT with 80x24, 80x32, 80x44 or 132x27 characters
* Model F provides a 7-color high-resolution 14 inch CRT with 80x24, 80x32, 80x44 or 132x27 characters
* Model G provides a 7-color 14 inch CRT with 80x24 or 80x32 characters
* Model L provides a green monochrome 15 inch CRT with 80x24, 80x32, 80x44 or 132x27 characters with a selector pen capability
* Model W provides a black and while 15 inch CRT with 80x24, 80x32, 80x44 or 132x27 characters

====3193====
The IBM 3193 Display Station is a high-resolution, portrait-type, monochrome, 380mm (15 inch) CRT image display providing up to letter or A4 size document display capabilities in addition to alphanumeric data.
Compressed images can be sent to the 3193 from a scanner and decompression is performed in the 3193.
Image data compression is a technique to save transmission time and reduce storage requirements.

====3194====
The IBM 3194 is a Display Station that features a 1.44 MB 3.5&quot; floppy drive and IND$FILE transfer.
* Model C provides a 12-inch color CRT with 80x24 or 80x32 characters
* Model D provides a 15-inch monochrome CRT with 80x24, 80x31, 80x44 or 132x27 characters
* Model H provides a 14-inch color CRT with 80x24, 80x31, 80x44 or 132x27 characters

====Subsequent====
*3104: low-cost R-loop connected terminal for the IBM 8100 system
*3472 Infowindow

====Non-IBM Displays====
Several third-party manufacturers produced 3270 displays besides IBM.

=====GTE=====
GTE manufactured the IS/7800 Video Display System, nominally compatible with IBM 3277 displays attached to a 3271 or 3272. An incompatibility with the RA buffer order broke the logon screen in VM/SE (SEPP).

=====Harris=====
Harris manufactured the 8000 Series Terminal Systems, compatible with IBM 3277 displays attached to a 3271 or 3272.

Harris later manufactured the 9100–9200 Information Processing Systems, which included
* 9178
* 9278
* 9279-2A
* 9279-3G
* 9280

=====Informer 270 376/SNA=====
Informer Computer Terminals manufactured a special version of their model 270 terminal that was compatible with IBM 3270 and its associated coax port to connect to a 3x74.

=====Memorex Telex=====

* Memorex 1377, compatible with IBM 3277Attaches to 1371 or 1372

Documentation for the following is available at

* Memorex/Telex 2078
* Memorex/Telex 2079
* Memorex/Telex 2080
* Memorex/Telex 2178
* Memorex/Telex 2179

=====Nokia/Alfaskop=====
* Alfaskop Display Unit 4110
* Alfaskop Display Unit 4112

=====AT&amp;T=====
AT&amp;T introduced the Dataspeed 40 terminal/controller, compatible with the IBM 3275, in 1980.

====Graphics models====
IBM had two different implementations for supporting graphics. The first was implemented in the optional Programmed Symbol Sets (PSS) of the 3278, 3279 and 3287, which became a standard feature on the later 3279-S3G, a.k.a. 3279G, and was based on piecing together graphics with on-the-fly custom-defined symbols downloaded to the terminal.

The second later implementation provided All Points Addressable (APA) graphics, a.k.a. Vector Graphics, allowing more efficient graphics than the older technique. The first terminal to support APA / Vector graphics was the 3179G terminal, which was later replaced by first the 3192G, then the 3472G.

Both implementations are supported by IBM GDDM — Graphical Data Display Manager first released in 1979, and by SAS with their SAS/GRAPH software.

=====IBM 3279G=====
IBM 3279-S3G, a.k.a. 3279G, terminal, announced in 1979, was IBM&#x27;s graphics replacement for the 3279-3B with PSS. The terminal supported 7 colors and the graphics were made up of Programmable Symbol sets loaded to the terminal by the graphical application GDDM — Graphical Data Display Manager using Write Structured Field command.

Programmable Symbols is an addition to the normal base character set consisting of Latin characters, numbers, etc. hardwired into the terminal. The 3279G supports six additional sets of symbols each supporting 190 symbols, resulting in a total of 1.140 programmable symbols. Three of the Programmable Symbols sets have three planes each enabling coloring (red, blue, green) the Programmable Symbols downloaded to those sets, thereby supporting a total of seven colors.

Each &#x27;character&#x27; cell consists of a 9x12 or a 9x16 dot matrix depending on the screen model. In order to program a cell with a symbol 18 bytes of data is needed making the data load quite heavy in some instances when compared to classic text screens.

If one for example wishes to draw a hyperbola on the screen, the application must first compute the required Programmable Symbols to make up hyperbola and load them to the terminal. The next step is then for the application to paint the screen by addressing the screen cell position and select the appropriate symbol in one of the Programmable Symbols sets.

The 3279G could be ordered with Attribute Select Keyboard enabling the operator to select attributes, colors and Programmable Symbols sets, making that version of the terminal quite distinctive.

=====IBM 3179G=====

The IBM 3179G announced June 18, 1985, is an IBM mainframe computer terminal providing 80×24 or 80×32 characters, 16 colors, plus graphics and is the first terminal to support the APA graphics apart from the 3270 PC/G, 3270 PC/GX, PC AT/G and PC AT/GX.

3179-G terminals combine text and graphics as separate layers on the screen. Although the text and graphics appear combined on the screen, the text layer actually sits over the graphics layer. The text layer contains the usual 3270-style cells which display characters (letters, numbers, symbols, or invisible control characters). The graphics layer is an area of 720×384 pixels. &quot;All Points Addressable&quot; or &quot;vector graphics&quot; is used to paint each pixel in one of sixteen colors. As well as being separate layers on the screen, the text and graphics layers are sent to the display in separate data streams, making them completely independent.

The application i.e. GDDM sends the vector definitions to the 3179-G, and the work of activating the pixels that represent the picture (the vector-to-raster conversion) is done in the terminal itself. The datastream is related to the number of graphics primitives (lines, arcs, and so on) in the picture. Arcs are split into short vectors, that are sent to the 3179-G to be drawn. The 3179-G does not store graphic data, and so cannot offload any manipulation function from GDDM. In particular, with user control, each new viewing operation means that the data has to be regenerated and retransmitted.

The 3179G is a distributed function terminal (DFT) and requires a downstream load (DSL) to load its microcode from the cluster controller&#x27;s floppy disk or hard drive.

The G10 model is a standard 122-key typewriter keyboard, while the G20 model offers APL on the same layout. Compatible with IBM System/370, IBM 4300 series, 303x, 308x, IBM 3090, and IBM 9370.

===== IBM 3192G =====
&lt;dfn&gt;The IBM 3192G, announced in&lt;/dfn&gt; 1987 &lt;dfn&gt;was the&lt;/dfn&gt; successor to 3179G. It featured 16 colors, and support for printers (i.e., IBM Proprinter) for local hardcopy with graphical support, or system printer, text only, implemented as an additional LU.

=====IBM 3472G=====
The IBM 3472G announced in 1989 was the successor to 3192G and featured five concurrent sessions, one of which could be graphics. Unlike the 3192-G, it needed no expansion unit to attach a mouse or color plotter, and it could also attach a tablet device for digitised input and a bar code reader.

=== APL / APL2 ===
Most IBM terminals, starting with the 3277, could be delivered with an APL keyboard, allowing the operator/programmer to enter APL symbolic instructions directly into the editor. In order to display APL symbols on the terminal, it had to be equipped with an APL character set in addition to the normal 3270-character set. The APL character set is addressed with a preceding Graphic Escape X&#x27;08&#x27; instruction.

With the advent of the graphic terminal 3179G, the APL character set was expandable to 138 characters, called APL2. The added characters were: Diamond, Quad Null, Iota Underbar, Epsilon Underbar, Left Tack, Right Tack, Equal Underbar, Squished Quad, Quad Slope, and Dieresis Dot. Later APL2 symbols were supported by 3191 Models D, E, L, the CUT version of 3192, and 3472.

Please note that IBM&#x27;s version&#x27;s of APL also is called APL2.

===Display-Controller===
* 3275 remote display with controller function (no additional displays up to one printer)
* 3276 remote display with controller function. IBM 3276, announced in 1981, was a combined remote controller and display terminal, offering support for up to 8 displays, the 3276 itself included. By default, the 3276 had two type A coax ports, one for its own display, and one free for an additional terminal or printer. Up to three additional adapters, each supporting two coax devices, could be installed. The 3276 could connect to a non-SNA or SNA host using BSC or SDLC with line speed of up to 9,600 bit/s. The 3276 looked very much like the 3278 terminal, and the terminal feature of the 3276 itself, was more or less identical to those of the 3278.

===Printers===

* 3284 matrix printer
* 3286 matrix printer
* 3287 printer, including a color model
* 3288 line printer
* 3268-1 R-loop connected stand-alone printer for the IBM 8100 system
* 4224 matrix printer
In 1984 announced IPDS – Intelligent Printer Data Stream for online printing of AFP — Advanced Function Presentation documents, using bidirectional communications between the application and the printer. IPDS support among others printing of text, fonts, images, graphics, and barcodes. The IBM 4224 is one of the IPDS capable dot matrix printers.

With the emergence of printers, including laser printers, from HP, Canon, and others, targeted the PC market, 3270 customers got an alternative to IBM 3270 printers by connecting this type of printers through printer protocol converters from manufactures like I-data, MPI Tech, Adacom, and others. The printer protocol converters basically emulate a 3287 type printer, and later extended to support IPDS.

The IBM 3482 terminal, announced in 1992, offered a printer port, which could be used for host addressable printing as well as local screen copy. codice_1

In the later versions of 3174 the Asynchronous Emulation Adapter (AEA), supporting async RS-232 character-based type terminals, was enhanced to support printers equipped with a serial interface.

=== Controllers ===
* 3271 remote controller
* 3272 local controller
* 3274 cluster controller (different models could be channel-attached or remote via BSC or SDLC communication lines, and had between eight and 32 coaxial ports)
* 3174 cluster controller

On the 3274 and 3174, IBM used the term configuration support &quot;letter&quot;, sometimes followed by a release number, to designate a list of features together with the hardware and microcode needed to support them.

By 1994 the 3174 Establishment Controller supported features such as attachment to multiple hosts via Token Ring, Ethernet, or X.25 in addition to the standard channel attach or SDLC; terminal attachment via twisted pair, Token Ring or Ethernet in addition to 3270 coaxial; and TN3270. They also support attachment of asynchronous ASCII terminals, printers, and plotters alongside 3270 devices.

==== 3274 controller ====
IBM introduced the 3274 controller family in 1977, replacing the 3271–2 product line.

Where the features of the 3271–2 was hardcoded, the 3274 was controlled by its microcode that was read from the 3274&#x27;s built-in 8&quot; floppy drive.

3274 models included 8, 12, 16, and 32 port remote controllers and 32-port local channel attached units. In total 16 different models were over time released to the market. The 3274-1A was an SNA physical Unit type 2.0 (PU2.0), required only a single address on the channel for all 32 devices and was not compatible with the 3272. The 3274-1B and 3274-1D were compatible with the 3272 and were referred to as local non-SNA models.

The 3274 controllers introduced a new generation of the coax protocol, named Category A, to differentiate them from the Category B coax devices, such as the 3277 terminal and the 3284 printer. The first Category A coax devices were the 3278 and the first color terminal, the IBM 3279 Color Display Station.

Enabling backward compatibility, it was possible to install coax boards, so-called &#x27;panels&#x27;, in groups of 4 or 8 supporting the now older Category B coax devices. A maximum of 16 Category B terminals could be supported, and only 8 if the controller were fully loaded with a maximum of 4 panels each supporting 8 Category A devices.

During its life span, the 3274 supported several features including:

* Extended Data Stream
* Extended Highlighting
* Programmed Symbol Set (PSS)
* V.24 interfaces with speed up to 14.4 kbit/s
* V.35 interfaces with speed up to 56 kbit/s
* X.25 network attachment
* DFT – Distributed Function Terminal
* DSL – Downstream load for 3290 and 3179G
* 9901 and 3299 multiplexer
* Entry Assist
* Dual Logic (the feature of having two sessions from a CUT mode display).

==== 3174 controller ====
IBM introduced the 3174 Subsystem Control Unit in 1986, replacing the 3274 product line.

The 3174 was designed to enhance the 3270 product line with many new connectivity options and features. Like the 3274, it was customizable, the main difference was that it used smaller (5.25-inch) diskettes than the 3274 (8-inch diskettes), and that the larger floor models had 10 slots for adapters, some of them were per default occupied by channel adapter/serial interface, coax adapter, etc. Unlike the 3274, any local models could be configured as either local SNA or local non-SNA, including PU2.1 (APPN).
The models included: 01L, 01R, 02R, 03R, 51R, 52R, 53R, 81R and 82R.

The 01L were local channel attached, the R models remotely connected, and the x3R Token Ring (upstream) connected. The 0xL/R models were floor units supporting up to 32 coax devices through the use of internal or external multiplexers (TMA/3299). The 5xR, models were shelf units with 9 coax ports, expandable to 16, by the connection of a 3299 multiplexer. The smallest desktop units, 8xR, had 4 coax ports expandable to 8, by the connection of a 3299 multiplexer.

In the 3174 controller line IBM also slightly altered the classical BNC coax connector by changing the BNC connector to DPC – Dual Purpose Connector. The DPC female connector was a few millimeters longer and with a built-in switch that detected if a normal BNC connector were connected or a newer DPC connector was connected, thereby changing the physical layer from 93 ohm unbalanced coax, to 150 ohm balanced twisted-pair, thereby directly supporting the IBM Cabling system without the need for a so-called red balun.

Configuration Support A was the first microcode offered with the 3174. It supported all the hardware modules present at the time, almost all the microcode features found in 3274 and introduced a number of new features including: Intelligent Printer Data Stream (IPDS), Multiple Logical Terminals, Country Extended Code Page (CECP), Response Time Monitor, and Token Ring configured as host interface.

Configuration Support S, strangely following release A, introduced that a local or remote controller could act as 3270 Token-Ring DSPU Gateway, supporting up to 80 Downstream PU&#x27;s.

In 1989, IBM introduced a new range of 3174 models and changed the name from 3174 Subsystem Control Unit to 3174 Establishment Controller. The main new feature was support for an additional 32 coax port in floor models.

The models included: 11L, 11R, 12R, 13R, 61R, 62R, 63R, 91R, and 92R.

The new line of controllers came with Configuration Support B release 1, increased the number of supported DSPU on the Token-Ring gateway to 250 units, and introduced at the same time &#x27;Group Polling&#x27; that offloaded the mainframe/VTAM polling requirement on the channel.

Configuration Support B release 2 to 5, enabled features like: Local Format Storage (CICS Screen Buffer), Type Ahead, Null/Space Processing, ESCON channel support.

In 1990–1991, a total of 7 more models were added: 21R, 21L, 12L, 22L, 22R, 23R, and 90R. The 12L offered ESCON fibreoptic channel attachment. The models with 2xx designation were equal to the 1xx models but repacked for rackmount and offered only 4 adapter slots. The 90R was not intended as a coax controller, it was positioned as a Token Ring 3270 DSPU gateway. However, it did have one coax port for configuring the unit, which with a 3299 multiplexer could be expanded to 8.

The line of controllers came with Configuration Support C to support ISDN, APPN and Peer Communication. The ISDN feature allowed downstream devices, typically PC&#x27;s, to connect to the 3174 via the ISDN network. The APPN support enabled the 3174 to be a part of an APPN network, and the Peer Communication allowed coax attached PC&#x27;s with &#x27;Peer Communication Support&#x27; to access resources on the Token-Ring network attached to the 3174.

The subsequent releases 2 to 6 of Configuration Support C enables support for: Split screen, Copy from session to session, Calculator function, Access to AS/400 host and 5250 keyboard emulation, Numerous APPN enhancements, TCP/IP Telnet support that allowed 3270 CUT terminals to communicate with TCP/IP servers using Telnet, and at the same time in another screen to communicate with the mainframe using native 3270. TN3270 support where the 3174 could connect to a TN3270 host/gateway, eliminating SNA, but preserving the 3270 data stream. IP forwarding allowing bridging of LAN (Token-Ring or Ethernet) connected devices downstream to the 3174 to route IP traffic onto the Frame Relay WAN interface.

In 1993, three new models were added with the announcement of Ethernet Adapter (FC 3045). The models were: 14R, 24R, and 64R.

This was also IBM&#x27;s final hardware announcement of 3174.

The floor models, and the rack-mountable units, could be expanded with a range of special 3174 adapters, that by 1993 included: Channel adapter, ESCON adapter, Serial (V.24/V.35) adapter, Concurrent Communication Adapter, Coax adapter, Fiber optic &quot;coax&quot; adapter, Async adapter, ISDN adapter, Token-Ring adapter, Ethernet adapter, and line encryption adapter.

In 1994, IBM incorporated the functions of RPQ 8Q0935 into Configuration Support-C release 3, including the TN3270 client.

====Non-IBM Controllers====
=====GTE=====
The GTE IS/7800 Video Display Systems used one of two nominally IBM compatible controllers:

* 7801 (remote, 3271 equivalent)
* 7802 (local, 3277 equivalent)

=====Harris=====
The Harris 8000 Series Terminal Systems used one of four controllers:

* 8171 (remote, 3271 equivalent)
* 8172 (local, 3277 equivalent)
* 8181 (remote, 3271 equivalent)
* 8182 (local, 3277 equivalent)
* 9116
* 9210
* 9220

=====Home grown=====
An alternative implementation of an establishment controller exists in form of OEC (Open Establishment Controller). It&#x27;s a combination of an Arduino shield with a BNC connector and a Python program that runs on a POSIX system. OEC allows to connect a 3270 display to IBM mainframes via TN3270 or to other systems via VT100. Currently only CUT but not DFT displays are supported.

=====Memorex=====
Memorex had two controllers for its 3277-compatible 1377; the 1371 for remote connection and the 1372 for local connection.

Later Memorex offered a series of controllers compatible with the IBM 3274 and 3174

* 2074
* 2076
* 2174
* 2274

===Multiplexers===
IBM offered a device called 3299 that acted as a multiplexer between an accordingly configured 3274 controller, with the 9901 multiplexer feature, and up to eight displays/printers, thereby reducing the number of coax cables between the 3x74 controller and the displays/printers.

With the introduction of the 3174 controller internal or external multiplexers (3299) became mainstream as the 3174-1L controller was equipped with four multiplexed ports each supporting eight devices. The internal 3174 multiplexer card was named TMA – Terminal Multiplexer adapter 9176.

A number of vendors manufactured 3270 multiplexers before and alongside IBM including Fibronics and Adacom offering multiplexers that supported TTP – Telephone Twisted Pair as an alternative to coax, and fiber-optic links between the multiplexers.

In some instances, the multiplexer worked as an &quot;expansion&quot; unit on smaller remote controllers including the 3174-81R / 91R, where the 3299 expanded the number of coax ports from four to eight, or the 3174-51R / 61R, where the 3299 expanded the number of coax ports from eight to 16.

==Manufacture==
The IBM 3270 display terminal subsystem was designed and developed by IBM&#x27;s Kingston, New York, laboratory (which later closed during IBM&#x27;s difficult time in the mid-1990s). The printers were developed by the Endicott, New York, laboratory. As the subsystem expanded, the 3276 display-controller was developed by the Fujisawa laboratory, Japan, and later the Yamato laboratory; and the 3279 color display and 3287 color printer by the Hursley, UK, laboratory. The subsystem products were manufactured in Kingston (displays and controllers), Endicott (printers), and Greenock, Scotland, UK, (most products) and shipped to users in U.S. and worldwide. 3278 terminals continued to be manufactured in Hortolândia, near Campinas, Brazil as far as late 1980s, having its internals redesigned by a local engineering team using modern CMOS technology, while retaining its external look and feel.

==Telnet 3270==
Telnet 3270, or tn3270 describes both the process of sending and receiving 3270 data streams using the telnet protocol and the software that emulates a 3270 class terminal that communicates using that process. tn3270 allows a 3270 terminal emulator to communicate over a TCP/IP network instead of an SNA network. Telnet 3270 can be used for either terminal or print connections. Standard telnet clients cannot be used as a substitute for tn3270 clients, as they use fundamentally different techniques for exchanging data.

TN3270 is typically deployed for online IBM mainframe application access via VTAM.

==Technical Information==

===3270 character set===
The 3270 displays are available with a variety of keyboards and character sets. The following table shows the 3275/3277/3284–3286 character set for US English EBCDIC (optional characters were available for US ASCII, and UK, French, German, and Italian EBCDIC).

On the 3275 and 3277 terminals without the a text feature, lower case characters display as uppercase. NL, EM, DUP, and FM control characters display and print as 5, 9, *, and ; characters, respectively, except by the printer when WCC or CCC bits 2 and 3 = &#x27;00&#x27;b, in which case NL and EM serve their control function and do not print.


===Data stream===

Data sent to the 3270 consist of commands, a Copy Control Character (CCC) or Write Control Character (WCC) if appropriate, a device address for copy, orders, character data and structured fields. Commands instruct the 3270 control unit to perform some action on a specified device, such as a read or write. Orders are sent as part of the data stream to control the format of the device buffer. Structured fields are to convey additional control functions and data to or from the terminal.

On a local non-SNA controller, the command is a CCW opcode rather than the first byte of the outbound display stream; on all other controllers, the command is the first byte of the display stream, exclusive of protocol headers.

====Commands====

The following table includes datastream commands and CCW opcodes for local non-SNA controllers; it does not include CCW opcodes for local SNA controllers.


====Write control character====
The data sent by Write or Erase/Write consists of the command code itself followed by a &quot;Write Control Character&quot; (WCC) optionally followed by a buffer containing orders or data (or both). The WCC controls the operation of the device. Bits may start printer operation and specify a print format. Other bit settings will sound the audible alarm if installed, unlock the keyboard to allow operator entry, or reset all the Modified Data Tags in the device buffer.

====Orders====
Orders consist of the order code byte followed by zero to three bytes of variable information.

====Attributes====
The 3270 has three kinds of attributes:
* Field attributes
* Extended attributes
* Character attributes

=====Field attributes=====
The original 3277 and 3275 displays used an 8-bit field attribute byte of which five bits were used.
* Bits 0 and 1 are set so that the attribute will always be a valid EBCDIC (or ASCII) character.
* Bit 2 is zero to indicate that the associated field is &quot;unprotected&quot; (operator could enter data) or one for &quot;protected&quot;.
* Bit 3 is zero to indicate that this field, if unprotected, could accept alphanumeric input. One indicates that only numeric input is accepted, and automatically shifts to numeric for some keyboards.
* Bit 4 and 5 operate in tandem: 
** &#x27;00&#x27;B indicate that the field is displayed on the screen and is not &quot;selector-pen detectable&quot;.
** &#x27;01&#x27;B indicates that the field is displayable and selector-pen detectable.
** &#x27;10&#x27;B indicates that the field is &quot;intensified&quot; (bright), displayable, and selector-pen detectable.
** &#x27;11&#x27;B indicates that the field is non-display, non-printable, and not pen detectable. This last can be used in conjunction with the modified data tag to imbed static data on the screen that will be read each time data was read from the device.
* Bit 7 is the &quot;Modified Data Tag&quot;, where &#x27;0&#x27; indicates that the associated field has not been modified by the operator and &#x27;1&#x27; indicates that it has been modified. As noted above, this bit can be set programmatically to cause the field to be treated as modified.

Later models include &quot;base color&quot;: &quot;Base color (four colors) can be produced on color displays and color printers from current 3270 application programs by use of combinations of the field intensify and field protection attribute bits. For more information on color, refer to IBM 3270 Information System: Color and Programmed Symbols, GA33-3056.&quot;

=====Extended attributes=====
The 3278 and 3279 and later models used &quot;extended attributes&quot; to add support for seven colors, blinking, reverse video, underscoring, field outlining, field validation, and programmed symbols.

=====Character attributes=====
The 3278 and 3279 and later models allowed attributes on individual characters in a field to override the corresponding field attributes.

This allowed programs (such as the LEXX text editor) to assign any font (including the programmable fonts), colour, etc. to any character on the screen.

====Buffer addressing====
3270 displays and printers have a buffer containing one byte for every screen position. For example, a 3277 model 2 featured a screen size of 24 rows of 80 columns for a buffer size of 1920 bytes. Bytes are addressed from zero to the screen size minus one, in this example 1919. &quot;There is a fixed relationship between each ... buffer storage location and its position on the display screen.&quot; Most orders start operation at the &quot;current&quot; buffer address, and executing an order or writing data will update this address. The buffer address can be set directly using the &quot;Set Buffer Address (SBA)&quot; order, often followed by &quot;Start Field&quot; or &quot;Start Field Extended&quot;. For a device with a 1920 character display a twelve bit address is sufficient. Later 3270s with larger screen sizes use fourteen or sixteen bits.

Addresses are encoded within orders in two bytes. For twelve bit addresses the high order two bits of each byte are set to form valid EBCDIC (or ASCII) characters. For example, address 0 is coded as X&#x27;4040&#x27;, or space-space, address 1919 is coded as X&#x27;5D7F&#x27;, or &quot;. Programmers hand-coding panels usually keep the table of addresses from the 3270 Component Description or the 3270 Reference Card handy. For fourteen and sixteen-bit address, the address uses contiguous bits in two bytes.

====Example====
The following data stream writes an attribute in row 24, column 1, writes the (protected) characters &#x27;&gt; &#x27; in row 24, columns 2 and 3, and creates an unprotected field on row 24 from columns 5-79. Because the buffer wraps around an attribute is placed on row 24, column 80 to terminate the input field. This data stream would normally be written using an Erase/Write command which would set undefined positions on the screen to &#x27;00&#x27;x. Values are given in hexadecimal.
===Extended Data Stream===

Most 3270 terminals newer than the 3275, 3277, 3284 and 3286 support an extended data stream (EDS) that allows many new capabilities, including:
*Display buffers larger than 4096 characters
*Additional field attributes, e.g., color
*Character attributes within a field
*Redefining display geometry
*Querying terminal characteristics
*Programmed Symbol Sets
*All Points Addressable (APA) graphics
