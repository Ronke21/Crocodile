<text>Legnica (; , ; ; ) is a city in southwestern Poland, in the central part of Lower Silesia, on the Kaczawa River and the Czarna Woda. As well as being the seat of the county, since 1992 the city has been the seat of the Diocese of Legnica. Legnica had a population of 97,300 inhabitants.

The city was first referenced in chronicles dating from the year 1004, although previous settlements could be traced back to the 7th century. The name &quot;Legnica&quot; was mentioned in 1149 under High Duke of Poland Bolesław IV the Curly. Legnica was most likely the seat of Bolesław and it became the residence of the dukes of Legnica from 1248 until 1675. Legnica is a city over which the Piast dynasty reigned the longest, for about 700 years, from the time of ruler Mieszko I of Poland after the creation of the Polish state in the 10th century, until 1675 and the death of the last Piast duke George William. Legnica is one of the historical burial sites of Polish monarchs and consorts.

Legnica became renowned for the fierce battle that took place at Legnickie Pole near the city on 9 April 1241 during the first Mongol invasion of Poland, which ended in the defeat of the Polish-led Christian coalition by the Mongols.

Legnica is an economic, cultural and academic centre in Lower Silesia, together with Wrocław. The city is renowned for its varied architecture, spanning from early medieval to modern period, and its preserved Old Town with the Piast Castle, one of the largest in Poland. According to the Foreign direct investment ranking (FDI) from 2016, Legnica is one of the most progressive high-income cities in the Silesian region.

==Population==
 Legnica has 102,708 inhabitants and is the third largest city in the voivodeship (after Wrocław and Wałbrzych) and 38th in Poland. It also constitutes the southernmost and the largest urban center of a copper deposit (&quot;Legnicko-Głogowski Okręg Miedziowy&quot;) with agglomeration of 448,617 inhabitants. Legnica is the largest city of the conurbation and is a member of the Association of Polish Cities.

==History==
===Pre-history===
Archaeological research conducted in eastern Legnica in the late 1970s, showed the existence of a bronze foundry and the graves of three metallurgists. The find indicates a time interval about year 1000 BC.

A settlement of the Lusatian culture people existed in the 8th century B.C. After invasions of Celts beyond upper Danube basin, the area of Legnica and north foothills of Sudetes was infiltrated by Celtic settlers and traders.

Tacitus and Ptolemy recorded the ancient nation of Lugii (Lygii) in the area, and mentioned their town of Lugidunum, which has been attributed to both Legnica and Głogów.

===Early Poland===

Slavic Lechitic tribes moved into the area in the 8th century.

The city was first officially mentioned in chronicles from 1004, although settlement dates to the 7th century. Dendrochronological research proves that during the reign of Mieszko I of Poland, a new fortified settlement was built here in a style typical of the early Piast dynasty. It is mentioned in 1149 when High Duke Bolesław IV the Curly funded a chapel at the St. Benedict monastery. Legnica was the most likely place of residence for Bolesław and it became the residence of the high dukes of Poland in 1163 and was the seat of a principality ruled from 1248 until 1675.

Legnica became famous for the battle that took place at Legnickie Pole near the city on 9 April 1241 during the First Mongol invasion of Poland. The Christian army of the Polish duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia, supported by feudal nobility, which included in addition to Poles, Bavarian miners and military orders and Czech troops, was decisively defeated by the Mongols. The Mongols killed Henry and destroyed his forces, then turned south to rejoin the rest of the Mongol armies, which were massing at the Plain of Mohi in Hungary via Moravia against a coalition of King Bela IV and his armies, and Bela&#x27;s Kipchak allies.

After the war, nonetheless, the city was developing rapidly. In 1258 at the church of St. Peter, a parish school was established, probably the first of its kind in Poland. Around 1278 a Dominican monastery was founded by Bolesław II the Horned, who was buried there as the only monarch of Poland to be buried in Legnica. Already by 1300 there was a city council in Legnica. Duke Bolesław III the Generous granted new trade privileges in 1314 and 1318 and allowed the construction of a town hall, and in 1337 the first waterworks were built. In the years 1327–1380 a new Gothic church of Saint Peter (today&#x27;s Cathedral) was erected in place of the old one, and is one of Legnica&#x27;s landmarks since. Also by the 14th century the city walls were erected. In 1345 the first coins were produced in the local mint. In 1374, the potters&#x27; guild was founded, as one of the oldest in Silesia. Queen consort of Poland Hedwig of Sagan died in Legnica in 1390 and was buried in the local collegiate church, which has not survived to this day.

===Duchy of Legnica===

As the capital of the Duchy of Legnica at the beginning of the 14th century, Legnica was one of the most important cities of Central Europe, having a population of nearly 16,000 residents. The city began to expand quickly after the discovery of gold in the Kaczawa River between Legnica and Złotoryja (Goldberg). Unfortunately, such a growth rate can not be maintained long. Shortly after the city reached its maximum population increase, wooden buildings which had been erected during this period of rapid growth were devastated by a huge fire. The fire decreased the number of inhabitants in the city and halted any significant further development for many decades.

Legnica, along with other Silesian duchies, became a vassal of the Kingdom of Bohemia during the 14th century and was included within the multi-ethnic Holy Roman Empire, however remained ruled by local dukes of the Polish Piast dynasty. In 1454, a local rebellion prevented Legnica from falling under direct rule of the Bohemian kings. In 1505, Duke Frederick II of Legnica met in Legnica with the duke of nearby Głogów, Sigismund I the Old, the future king of Poland.


The Protestant Reformation was introduced in the duchy as early as 1522 and the population became Lutheran. In 1526, a Protestant university was established in Legnica, which, however, was closed in 1529. In 1528 the first printing house in Legnica was established. After the death of King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia at Mohács in 1526, Legnica became a fief of the Habsburg monarchy of Austria. The first map of Silesia was made by native son Martin Helwig. The city suffered during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1633 a plague epidemic broke out, and in 1634 the Austrian army destroyed the suburbs.

In 1668 Duke of Legnica Christian presented his candidacy to the Polish throne, however, in the 1669 Polish–Lithuanian royal election he wasn&#x27;t chosen as King. In 1676, Legnica passed to direct Habsburg rule after the death of the last Silesian Piast duke and the last Piast duke overall, George William (son of Duke Christian), despite the earlier inheritance pact by Brandenburg and Silesia, by which it was to go to Brandenburg. The last Piast duke was buried in the St. John&#x27;s church in Legnica in 1676.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Silesian aristocracy was trained at the Liegnitz Ritter-Akademie, established in the early 18th century. One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the city in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland traveled that route many times. The postal milestone of King Augustus II comes from that period.

In 1742 most of Silesia, including Liegnitz, became part of the Kingdom of Prussia after King Frederick the Great&#x27;s defeat of Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1760 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, Liegnitz was the site of the Battle of Liegnitz when Frederick&#x27;s army defeated an Austrian army led by Laudon.

During the Napoleonic Wars and Polish national liberation fights, in 1807 Polish uhlans were stationed in the city, and in 1813, the Prussians, under Field Marshal Blücher, defeated the French forces of MacDonald in the Battle of Katzbach (Kaczawa) nearby. After the administrative reorganization of the Prussian state following the Congress of Vienna, Liegnitz and the surrounding territory (&quot;Landkreis Liegnitz&quot;) were incorporated into the Regierungsbezirk (administrative district) of Liegnitz, within the Province of Silesia on 1 May 1816. Along with the rest of Prussia, the town became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany. On 1 January 1874 Liegnitz became the third city in Lower Silesia (after Breslau and Görlitz) to be raised to an urban district, although the district administrator of the surrounding &quot;Landkreis&quot; of Liegnitz continued to have his seat in the city. Its military garrison was home to Königsgrenadier-Regiment Nr. 7 a military unit formed almost exclusively out of Polish soldiers.

===The 20th century===
The census of 1910 gave Liegnitz&#x27;s population as 95.86% German, 0.15% German and Polish, 1.27% Polish, 2.26% Wendish, and 0.19% Czech. On 1 April 1937 parts of the &quot;Landkreis&quot; of Liegnitz communities of Alt Beckern (Piekary), Groß Beckern (Piekary Wielkie), Hummel, Liegnitzer Vorwerke, Pfaffendorf (Piątnica) und Prinkendorf (Przybków) were incorporated into the city limits. After the Treaty of Versailles following World War I, Liegnitz was part of the newly created Province of Lower Silesia from 1919 to 1938, then of the Province of Silesia from 1938 to 1941, and again of the Province of Lower Silesia from 1941 to 1945. After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, as early as 1933, a boycott of local Jewish premises was ordered, during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938 the synagogue was burned down, and in 1939 the local Polish population was terrorized and persecuted. A Nazi court prison was operated in the city with a forced labour subcamp. During World War II, several members of the Polish resistance movement were imprisoned and sentenced to death there. The Germans also established two forced labour camps in the city, as well as two prisoner of war labor subcamps of the POW camp located in Żagań (then &quot;Sagan&quot;), and one labor subcamp of the Stalag VIII-A POW camp in Zgorzelec (then &quot;Görlitz&quot;).
After the defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II, Liegnitz and all of Silesia east of the Neisse was preliminarily transferred to Poland following the Potsdam Conference in 1945. The majority of the German population was either expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement or fled from the city.

The city was repopulated with Poles, including expellees from pre-war eastern Poland after its annexation by the Soviet Union. Also Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in Legnica in 1950. As the medieval Polish name &quot;Lignica&quot; was considered archaic, the town was renamed Legnica. The transfer to Poland decided at Potsdam in 1945 was officially recognized by East Germany in 1950, by West Germany under Chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw, and finally by the reunited Germany by the Two Plus Four Agreement in 1990. By 1990 only a handful of Polonized Germans, prewar citizens of Liegnitz, remained of the pre-1945 German population. In 2010 the city celebrated the 65th anniversary of the return of Legnica to Poland and its liberation from Nazi Germany.

The city was only partly damaged in World War II. In June 1945 Legnica was briefly the capital of the Lower Silesian (Wrocław) Voivodship, after the administration was moved there from Trzebnica and before it was finally moved to Wrocław. In 1947, the Municipal Library was opened, in 1948 a piano factory was founded, and in the years 1951-1959 Poland&#x27;s first copper smelter was built in Legnica. After 1965 most parts of the preserved old town with its town houses were demolished, the historical layout was abolished, and the city was rebuilt in modern form.

From 1945 to 1990, during the Cold War, the headquarters of the Soviet forces in Poland, the so-called Northern Group of Forces, was located in the city. This fact had a strong influence on the life of the city. For much of the period, the city was divided into Polish and Soviet areas, with the latter closed to the public. These were first established in July 1945, when the Soviets forcibly ejected newly arrived Polish inhabitants from the parts of the city they wanted for their own use. The ejection was perceived by some as a particularly brutal action, and rumours circulated exaggerating its severity, though no evidence of anyone being killed in the course of it has come to light. In April 1946 city officials estimated that there were 16,700 Poles, 12,800 Germans, and 60,000 Soviets in Legnica. In October 1956, the largest anti-Soviet demonstrations in Lower Silesia took place in Legnica. The last Soviet units left the city in 1993.

Between 1 June 1975 and 1998 Legnica was the capital of the Legnica Voivodeship. In 1992 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Legnica was established, Tadeusz Rybak became the first bishop of Legnica. New local newspapers and a radio station were founded in the 1990s. In 1997, Legnica was visited by Pope John Paul II. The city suffered in the 1997 Central European flood.

<doc id="18119" wikidata="Q1130849" url="?curid=18119" title="Liverpool F.C.">
<text>Liverpool Football Club is a professional football club based in Liverpool, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world.

Domestically, the club has won nineteen league titles, eight FA Cups, a record ten League Cups and sixteen FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups—all English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup. Liverpool established itself as a major force in domestic football in the 1960s under Bill Shankly, before becoming perennial title challengers at home and abroad under Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish who led the club to a combined eleven league titles and four European Cups through the 1970s and 80s. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club&#x27;s first during the Premier League era.

Already nicknamed &quot;The Reds&quot;, it was under Shankly in the 60s that the team first adopted the distinctive all-red home strip which has been used ever since. Also adopted under Shankly&#x27;s tenure was the club&#x27;s anthem &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. The Reds compete in the local Merseyside derby against fellow Liverpool club Everton, often referred to simply as &quot;The Blues&quot;. As the two most decorated clubs in England, and inter-city rivals, Liverpool also has a long-standing rivalry with the Manchester club Manchester United.

The club&#x27;s supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths, most of which were Italians and Juventus fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European competitions, and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a crowd crush against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for justice saw further coroner&#x27;s inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.

== History ==

Liverpool were founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield. Originally named &quot;Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd&quot; (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.

Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players—the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland—so they became known as the &quot;team of Macs&quot;. The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94 season. After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.

Liverpool reached their first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham United centre half George Kay. Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal. The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season. Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958–59 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24 players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other &quot;Boot Room&quot; members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team.

The club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final. Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley. In 1976, Paisley&#x27;s second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979. During Paisley&#x27;s nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 20 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.

Paisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan. Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan&#x27;s first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season. Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence that separated the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.

Fagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager. During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup &quot;Double&quot; in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool&#x27;s success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster: in an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing. Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later, the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness, and the 97th, Andrew Devine, died in 2021 of injuries sustained in the disaster. After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.

Liverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.

Dalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player Graeme Souness. Under his leadership Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by Roy Evans, and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final. While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned. In 2001, Houllier&#x27;s second full season in charge, Liverpool won a &quot;treble&quot;: the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal. They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.

Houllier was replaced by Rafael Benítez at the end of the 2003–04 season. Despite finishing fifth in Benítez&#x27;s first season, Liverpool won the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, beating A.C. Milan 3–2 in a penalty shootout after the match ended with a score of 3–3. The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating West Ham United in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–3. American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks became the owners of the club during the 2006–07 season, in a deal which valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. The club reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan, as it had in 2005, but lost 2–1. During the 2008–09 season Liverpool achieved 86 points, its then-highest Premier League points total, prior to the record-breaking 2018–19 season, and finished as runners up to Manchester United.

In the 2009–10 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Benítez subsequently left by mutual consent and was replaced by Fulham manager Roy Hodgson. At the start of the 2010–11 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the club&#x27;s creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club, overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett. John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox and of Fenway Sports Group, bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 2010. Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson leaving the club by mutual consent and former player and manager Kenny Dalglish taking over. In the 2011–12 season, Liverpool secured a record eighth League Cup success and reached the FA Cup final, but finished in eighth position, the worst league finish in 18 years; this led to the sacking of Dalglish. He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers, whose Liverpool team in the 2013–14 season mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions Manchester City and subsequently return to the Champions League, scoring 101 goals in the process, the most since the 106 scored in the 1895–96 season. Following a disappointing 2014–15 season, where Liverpool finished sixth in the league, and a poor start to the following campaign, Rodgers was sacked in October 2015.

Rodgers was replaced by Jürgen Klopp. Liverpool reached the finals of the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in Klopp&#x27;s first season, finishing as runner-up in both competitions. The club finished second in the 2018–19 season with 97 points (surpassing the 86 points gained during the 2008–09 season), losing only one game: a points record for a non-title winning side. Klopp took Liverpool to successive Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, with the club defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to win the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final. Liverpool beat Flamengo of Brazil in the final 1–0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time. Liverpool then went on to win the 2019–20 Premier League, winning their first top-flight league title in thirty years. The club set multiple records in the season, including winning the league with seven games remaining making it the earliest any team has ever won the title, amassing a club record 99 points, and achieving a joint-record 32 wins in a top-flight season. In January 2024, Klopp announced that he would leave the club at the end of the season. On 20 May 2024, Arne Slot was announced as Klopp&#x27;s successor, becoming head coach on 1 June.

== Colours and badge ==

For much of Liverpool&#x27;s history, its home colours have been all red. When the club was founded in 1892, blue and white quartered shirts were used until the club adopted the city&#x27;s colour of red in 1896. The city&#x27;s symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the club&#x27;s badge (or crest, as it is sometimes known) in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all-red strip. Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht, as Ian St John recalled in his autobiography:

The Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and ecru, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team&#x27;s home kit. Between 2012 and 2015, the kits were designed by Warrior Sports, who became the club&#x27;s kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season. In February 2015, Warrior&#x27;s parent company New Balance announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance. The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985, when they were replaced by Adidas, who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over. They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012. Nike became the club&#x27;s official kit supplier at the start of the 2020–21 season.

Liverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor&#x27;s logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with Hitachi in 1979. However, for the first few years of the deal, broadcasting rules meant that sponsors logos could not be shown on shirts for televised matches.

Since then, the club has been sponsored by Crown Paints, Candy, Carlsberg and Standard Chartered. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football. The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club&#x27;s sponsor.

The Liverpool badge is based on the city&#x27;s liver bird symbol, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1977, a red liver bird standing on a football (blazoned as &quot;Statant upon a football a Liver Bird wings elevated and addorsed holding in the beak a piece of seaweed gules&quot;) was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League intended for use by Liverpool. However, Liverpool never made use of this badge. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports&#x27; first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough. Following the death of Andrew Devine and the subsequent ruling by a coroner that he was unlawfully killed, the number 97 has been worn in this place since the beginning of the 2022–23 season.
== Stadium ==


Liverpool&#x27;s home stadium is Anfield, which was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park. Situated 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre, it was originally used by Everton before the latter moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding. Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool&#x27;s first match at Anfield.

The Kop is the stadium section where Liverpool&#x27;s most vocal supporters, often referred to as &quot;Kopites,&quot; have traditionally gathered. Historically, the Kop was a terraced stand before it was converted to seating, and it has long been recognized as the heart of Anfield&#x27;s fan base. It was originally built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0. In 1906, the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal. The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool. At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadiums in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield&#x27;s was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.

Anfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s, when, following recommendations from the Taylor Report, all clubs in the Premier League were obliged to convert to all-seater stadiums in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing its capacity to 45,276. The findings of the report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season.

Because of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 2002. Planning permission was granted in July 2004, and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a 999-year lease on the proposed site. Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with HKS, Inc. contracted to build the stadium. Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300 million needed for the development. In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment, the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately £150m. When construction was completed on the new Main stand, the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This £100 million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a £260 million project to improve the Anfield area. Jürgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as &quot;impressive&quot;.

In June 2021, it was reported that Liverpool City Council had given planning permission for the club to renovate and expand the Anfield Road stand, boosting the capacity by around 7,000 and taking the overall capacity at Anfield to 61,000. The expansion, which is estimated to cost £60m, was described as &quot;a huge milestone&quot; by managing director Andy Hughes, and would also see rail seating being trialled in the Kop for the 2021–22 Premier League season. The first league game to feature an attendance of over 60,000 at Anfield, following the near completion of the Anfield Road stand redevelopment, was a Premier League match against Brighton on 31 March 2024.

== Support ==
Liverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes 300 officially recognised Supporters Clubs in 100 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours, which has included playing in front of 101,000 in Michigan, U.S., and 95,000 in Melbourne, Australia. The club also has a significant following on social media, and in 2024, it became the first Premier League club (and the third sports team in the world, after Barcelona and Real Madrid) to amass 10 million subscribers on YouTube. Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008, a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.

The song &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Carousel&quot; and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry and the Pacemakers, is the club&#x27;s anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s. Simon Hart of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote: &quot;The pre-match, scarfs-raised, sing-it-loud ritual is as much a part of Liverpool&#x27;s fabric as their red shirts.&quot; The song&#x27;s title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club&#x27;s badge.

The club&#x27;s supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 people, mostly Italians and Juventus supporters, were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters, and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990. Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial. In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14 Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter; half of the terms were suspended.

The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-seven Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days, &quot;The Sun&quot;″s coverage of the event spread falsehoods, particularly an article entitled &quot;The Truth&quot; that claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police. Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy &quot;The Sun&quot; 30 years later. Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice.

=== Rivalries ===

Liverpool&#x27;s longest-established rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton, against whom they contest the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from Liverpool&#x27;s formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield. The Merseyside derby is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and hence has been known as the &quot;friendly derby&quot;. Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game. It has been referred to as &quot;the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League&quot;. In terms of support within the city, the number of Liverpool fans outweighs Everton supporters by a ratio of 2:1.

Liverpool&#x27;s rivalry with Manchester United stems from the cities&#x27; competition in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. Connected by the world&#x27;s first inter-city railway, by road Liverpool and Manchester are separated by approximately 30 miles (48 km) along the East Lancs Road. Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by &quot;France Football&quot; magazine, Liverpool and Manchester United are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions, and both clubs have a global fanbase. Viewed as one of the biggest rivalries in world football, it is considered the most famous fixture in English football. The two clubs alternated as champions between 1964 and 1967, and Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968, followed by Liverpool&#x27;s four European Cup victories. Despite the 39 league titles and nine European Cups between them, the two rivals have rarely been successful at the same time – Liverpool&#x27;s run of titles in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with Manchester United&#x27;s 26-year title drought while United&#x27;s success in the Premier League-era coincided with Liverpool&#x27;s 30-year title drought, with the two clubs having finished first and second in the league only five times. Such is the rivalry between the clubs that they rarely do transfer business with each other. The last player to be transferred between the two clubs was Phil Chisnall, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.

== Ownership and finances ==

As the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club&#x27;s first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houlding&#x27;s departure. McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League. The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool&#x27;s history before stepping down in 1990. His successor was Noel White who became chairman in 1990. In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years, became chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51 percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.

Moores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. The pair paid £5,000 per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club&#x27;s debts. Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans&#x27; lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club. Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale. In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion. The group&#x27;s creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and paved the way for the sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal. Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for £300m.

Liverpool has been described as a global brand; a 2010 report valued the club&#x27;s trademarks and associated intellectual property at £141m, an increase of £5m on the previous year. Liverpool was given a brand rating of AA (Very Strong). In April 2010, business magazine &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Liverpool as the sixth most valuable football team in the world, behind Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Barcelona and Bayern Munich; they valued the club at $822m (£532m), excluding debt. Accountants Deloitte ranked Liverpool eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League, which ranks the world&#x27;s football clubs in terms of revenue. Liverpool&#x27;s income in the 2009–10 season was €225.3m. According to a 2018 report by Deloitte, the club had an annual revenue of €424.2 million for the previous year, and &quot;Forbes&quot; valued the club at $1.944 billion. In 2018, annual revenue increased to €513.7 million, and &quot;Forbes&quot; valued the club at $2.183 billion. In 2019, revenue increased to €604 million (£533 million) according to Deloitte, with the club breaching the half a billion pounds mark.

In April 2020, the owners of the club came under fire from fans and the media for deciding to furlough all non-playing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this, the club made a U-turn on the decision and apologised for their initial decision. In April 2021, &quot;Forbes&quot; valued the club at $4.1 billion, a two-year increase of 88%, making it the world&#x27;s fifth-most-valuable football club. Based on the latest rankings by &quot;Forbes&quot;, as of May 2023, Liverpool is ranked as the fourth most valuable football club in the world, behind Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona; they valued the club at $5.29 billion, an increase of 19% from 2022.

== Liverpool in the media ==
Liverpool featured in the first edition of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, which screened highlights of their match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967. Liverpool fans featured in the Pink Floyd song &quot;Fearless&quot;, in which they sang excerpts from &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. To mark the club&#x27;s appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released the &quot;Anfield Rap&quot;, a song featuring John Barnes and other members of the squad.

A docudrama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by Jimmy McGovern, was screened in 1996. It featured Christopher Eccleston as Trevor Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums, and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group. Liverpool featured in the 2001 film &quot;The 51st State&quot;, in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United. The club also featured in the 1984 children&#x27;s television show &quot;Scully&quot;, about a young boy who tries to gain a trial with Liverpool. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Halloween Apocalypse&quot;, aired in October 2021, features The Doctor (played by Jodie Whittaker) exiting the TARDIS outside Anfield, as she exclaims: &quot;Liverpool? Anfield! Klopp era, classic!&quot;.

In 2024, Liverpool was named the most-watched club in world football across the last five seasons by media analytics firm Nielsen with an average per season global broadcast audience of more than 724 million across league and cup fixtures.

== Honours ==


Liverpool&#x27;s first trophy was the Lancashire League, which it won in the club&#x27;s first season. In 1901, the club won its first League title, while the nineteenth and most recent was in 2020. Its first success in the FA Cup was in 1965. In terms of the number of trophies won, Liverpool&#x27;s most successful decade was the 1980s, when the club won six League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Football League Super Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared) and two European Cups. In 2020, Liverpool became the first English club to have won a League title in eight different decades.

The club has accumulated more top-flight wins and points than any other English team. Liverpool also has the highest average league finishing position (3.3) for the 50-year period to 2015 and second-highest average league finishing position for the period 1900–1999 after Arsenal, with an average league placing of 8.7.

Liverpool is the most successful British club in international football with fourteen trophies, having won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League (UEFA&#x27;s premier club competition) six times, an English record that is only surpassed by Real Madrid and A.C. Milan. Liverpool&#x27;s fifth European Cup win, in 2005, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and was also awarded a multiple-winner badge. Liverpool also hold the English record of three wins in the UEFA Cup, UEFA&#x27;s secondary club competition. Liverpool also hold the English record of four wins in the UEFA Super Cup. In 2019, the club won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, and also became the first English club to win the international treble of Club World Cup, Champions League and UEFA Super Cup.

<doc id="18120" wikidata="Q83330" url="?curid=18120" title="Lysosome">
<text>A lysosome () is a single membrane-bound organelle found in many animal cells. They are spherical vesicles that contain hydrolytic enzymes that digest many kinds of biomolecules. A lysosome has a specific composition, of both its membrane proteins and its lumenal proteins. The lumen&#x27;s pH (~4.5–5.0) is optimal for the enzymes involved in hydrolysis, analogous to the activity of the stomach. Besides degradation of polymers, the lysosome is involved in cell processes of secretion, plasma membrane repair, apoptosis, cell signaling, and energy metabolism.

Lysosomes are degradative organelles that act as the waste disposal system of the cell by digesting used materials in the cytoplasm, from both inside and outside the cell. Material from outside the cell is taken up through endocytosis, while material from the inside of the cell is digested through autophagy. The sizes of the organelles vary greatly—the larger ones can be more than 10 times the size of the smaller ones. They were discovered and named by Belgian biologist Christian de Duve, who eventually received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974.

Lysosomes contain more than 60 different enzymes, and have more than 50 membrane proteins. Enzymes of the lysosomes are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and exported to the Golgi apparatus upon recruitment by a complex composed of CLN6 and CLN8 proteins. The enzymes are transported from the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes in small vesicles, which fuse with larger acidic vesicles. Enzymes destined for a lysosome are tagged with the molecule mannose 6-phosphate, so that they are properly sorted into acidified vesicles.

In 2009, Marco Sardiello and co-workers discovered that the synthesis of most lysosomal enzymes and membrane proteins is controlled by transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes the transcription of nuclear genes. Mutations in the genes for these enzymes are responsible for more than 50 different human genetic disorders collectively known as lysosomal storage diseases. These diseases result in an accumulation of specific substrates, due to the inability to break them down. These genetic defects are related to several neurodegenerative disorders, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and aging-related diseases.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;lysosome&quot; (, ) is Neo-Latin that uses the combining forms &quot;lyso-&quot; (referring to and derived from the Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to loosen&quot;, via Ancient Greek λύσις [lúsis]), and &quot;&quot;, from &quot;soma&quot;, &quot;body&quot;, yielding &quot;body that lyses&quot; or &quot;lytic body&quot;. The adjectival form is &quot;lysosomal&quot;. The forms &quot;*lyosome&quot; and &quot;*lyosomal&quot; are much rarer; they use the &quot;&quot; form of the prefix but are often treated by readers and editors as mere unthinking replications of typos, which has no doubt been true as often as not.

==Discovery==

Christian de Duve, at the Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, had been studying the mechanism of action of insulin in liver cells. By 1949, he and his team had focused on the enzyme called glucose 6-phosphatase, which is the first crucial enzyme in sugar metabolism and the target of insulin. They already suspected that this enzyme played a key role in regulating blood sugar levels. However, even after a series of experiments, they failed to purify and isolate the enzyme from the cellular extracts. Therefore, they tried a more arduous procedure of cell fractionation, by which cellular components are separated based on their sizes using centrifugation.

They succeeded in detecting the enzyme activity from the microsomal fraction. This was the crucial step in the serendipitous discovery of lysosomes. To estimate this enzyme activity, they used that of the standardized enzyme acid phosphatase and found that the activity was only 10% of the expected value. One day, the enzyme activity of purified cell fractions which had been refrigerated for five days was measured. Surprisingly, the enzyme activity was increased to normal of that of the fresh sample. The result was the same no matter how many times they repeated the estimation, and led to the conclusion that a membrane-like barrier limited the accessibility of the enzyme to its substrate, and that the enzymes were able to diffuse after a few days (and react with their substrate). They described this membrane-like barrier as a &quot;saclike structure surrounded by a membrane and containing acid phosphatase.&quot;

It became clear that this enzyme from the cell fraction came from membranous fractions, which were definitely cell organelles, and in 1955 De Duve named them &quot;lysosomes&quot; to reflect their digestive properties. The same year, Alex B. Novikoff from the University of Vermont visited de Duve&#x27;s laboratory, and successfully obtained the first electron micrographs of the new organelle. Using a staining method for acid phosphatase, de Duve and Novikoff confirmed the location of the hydrolytic enzymes of lysosomes using light and electron microscopic studies. de Duve won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 for this discovery.

Originally, De Duve had termed the organelles the &quot;suicide bags&quot; or &quot;suicide sacs&quot; of the cells, for their hypothesized role in apoptosis. However, it has since been concluded that they only play a minor role in cell death.

== Function and structure ==

Lysosomes contain a variety of enzymes, enabling the cell to break down various biomolecules it engulfs, including peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids (lysosomal lipase). The enzymes responsible for this hydrolysis require an acidic environment for optimal activity.

In addition to being able to break down polymers, lysosomes are capable of fusing with other organelles &amp; digesting large structures or cellular debris; through cooperation with phagosomes, they are able to conduct autophagy, clearing out damaged structures. Similarly, they are able to break down virus particles or bacteria in phagocytosis of macrophages.

The size of lysosomes varies from 0.1 μm to 1.2 μm. With a pH ranging from ~4.5–5.0, the interior of the lysosomes is acidic compared to the slightly basic cytosol (pH 7.2). The lysosomal membrane protects the cytosol, and therefore the rest of the cell, from the degradative enzymes within the lysosome. The cell is additionally protected from any lysosomal acid hydrolases that drain into the cytosol, as these enzymes are pH-sensitive and do not function well or at all in the alkaline environment of the cytosol. This ensures that cytosolic molecules and organelles are not destroyed in case there is leakage of the hydrolytic enzymes from the lysosome.

The lysosome maintains its pH differential by pumping in protons (H+ ions) from the cytosol across the membrane via proton pumps and chloride ion channels. Vacuolar-ATPases are responsible for transport of protons, while the counter transport of chloride ions is performed by ClC-7 Cl−/H+ antiporter. In this way a steady acidic environment is maintained.

It sources its versatile capacity for degradation by import of enzymes with specificity for different substrates; cathepsins are the major class of hydrolytic enzymes, while lysosomal alpha-glucosidase is responsible for carbohydrates, and lysosomal acid phosphatase is necessary to release phosphate groups of phospholipids.

Recent research also indicates that lysosomes can act as a source of intracellular calcium.

== Formation ==
Many components of animal cells are recycled by transferring them inside or embedded in sections of membrane. For instance, in endocytosis (more specifically, macropinocytosis), a portion of the cell&#x27;s plasma membrane pinches off to form vesicles that will eventually fuse with an organelle within the cell. Without active replenishment, the plasma membrane would continuously decrease in size. It is thought that lysosomes participate in this dynamic membrane exchange system and are formed by a gradual maturation process from endosomes.

The production of lysosomal proteins suggests one method of lysosome sustainment. Lysosomal protein genes are transcribed in the nucleus in a process that is controlled by transcription factor EB (TFEB). mRNA transcripts exit the nucleus into the cytosol, where they are translated by ribosomes. The nascent peptide chains are translocated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where they are modified. Lysosomal soluble proteins exit the endoplasmic reticulum via COPII-coated vesicles after recruitment by the EGRESS complex (ER-to-Golgi relaying of enzymes of the lysosomal system), which is composed of CLN6 and CLN8 proteins. COPII vesicles then deliver lysosomal enzymes to the Golgi apparatus, where a specific lysosomal tag, mannose 6-phosphate, is added to the peptides. The presence of these tags allow for binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi apparatus, a phenomenon that is crucial for proper packaging into vesicles destined for the lysosomal system.

Upon leaving the Golgi apparatus, the lysosomal enzyme-filled vesicle fuses with a late endosome, a relatively acidic organelle with an approximate pH of 5.5. This acidic environment causes dissociation of the lysosomal enzymes from the mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The enzymes are packed into vesicles for further transport to established lysosomes. The late endosome itself can eventually grow into a mature lysosome, as evidenced by the transport of endosomal membrane components from the lysosomes back to the endosomes.

== Pathogen entry ==
As the endpoint of endocytosis, the lysosome also acts as a safeguard in preventing pathogens from being able to reach the cytoplasm before being degraded. Pathogens often hijack endocytotic pathways such as pinocytosis in order to gain entry into the cell. The lysosome prevents easy entry into the cell by hydrolyzing the biomolecules of pathogens necessary for their replication strategies; reduced lysosomal activity results in an increase in viral infectivity, including HIV. In addition, AB5 toxins such as cholera hijack the endosomal pathway while evading lysosomal degradation.

==Clinical significance==

Lysosomes are involved in a group of genetically inherited deficiencies, or mutations called lysosomal storage diseases (LSD), inborn errors of metabolism caused by a dysfunction of one of the enzymes. The rate of incidence is estimated to be 1 in 5,000 births, and the true figure expected to be higher as many cases are likely to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The primary cause is deficiency of an acid hydrolase. Other conditions are due to defects in lysosomal membrane proteins that fail to transport the enzyme, non-enzymatic soluble lysosomal proteins. The initial effect of such disorders is accumulation of specific macromolecules or monomeric compounds inside the endosomal–autophagic–lysosomal system. This results in abnormal signaling pathways, calcium homeostasis, lipid biosynthesis and degradation and intracellular trafficking, ultimately leading to pathogenetic disorders. The organs most affected are brain, viscera, bone and cartilage.

There is no direct medical treatment to cure LSDs. The most common LSD is Gaucher&#x27;s disease, which is due to deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Consequently, the enzyme substrate, the fatty acid glucosylceramide accumulates, particularly in white blood cells, which in turn affects spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain and bone marrow. The disease is characterized by bruises, fatigue, anaemia, low blood platelets, osteoporosis, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. As of 2017, enzyme replacement therapy is available for treating 8 of the 50-60 known LDs.

The most severe and rarely found, lysosomal storage disease is inclusion cell disease.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy is another lysosomal storage disease that also affects sphingolipid metabolism.

Dysfunctional lysosome activity is also heavily implicated in the biology of aging, and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, and cardiovascular disease.

== Different enzymes present in Lysosomes ==


===Lysosomotropism===

Weak bases with lipophilic properties accumulate in acidic intracellular compartments like lysosomes. While the plasma and lysosomal membranes are permeable for neutral and uncharged species of weak bases, the charged protonated species of weak bases do not permeate biomembranes and accumulate within lysosomes. The concentration within lysosomes may reach levels 100 to 1000 fold higher than extracellular concentrations. This phenomenon is called , &quot;acid trapping&quot; or &quot;proton pump&quot; effect. The amount of accumulation of lysosomotropic compounds may be estimated using a cell-based mathematical model.

A significant part of the clinically approved drugs are lipophilic weak bases with lysosomotropic properties. This explains a number of pharmacological properties of these drugs, such as high tissue-to-blood concentration gradients or long tissue elimination half-lives; these properties have been found for drugs such as haloperidol, levomepromazine, and amantadine. However, high tissue concentrations and long elimination half-lives are explained also by lipophilicity and absorption of drugs to fatty tissue structures. Important lysosomal enzymes, such as acid sphingomyelinase, may be inhibited by lysosomally accumulated drugs. Such compounds are termed FIASMAs (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase) and include for example fluoxetine, sertraline, or amitriptyline.

Ambroxol is a lysosomotropic drug of clinical use to treat conditions of productive cough for its mucolytic action. Ambroxol triggers the exocytosis of lysosomes via neutralization of lysosomal pH and calcium release from acidic calcium stores. Presumably for this reason, Ambroxol was also found to improve cellular function in some disease of lysosomal origin such as Parkinson&#x27;s or lysosomal storage disease.

=== Systemic lupus erythematosus ===
Impaired lysosome function is prominent in systemic lupus erythematosus preventing macrophages and monocytes from degrading neutrophil extracellular traps and immune complexes. The failure to degrade internalized immune complexes stems from chronic mTORC2 activity, which impairs lysosome acidification. As a result, immune complexes in the lysosome recycle to the surface of macrophages causing an accumulation of nuclear antigens upstream of multiple lupus-associated pathologies.

== Controversy in botany ==

By scientific convention, the term lysosome is applied to these vesicular organelles only in animals, and the term vacuole is applied to those in plants, fungi and algae (some animal cells also have vacuoles). Discoveries in plant cells since the 1970s started to challenge this definition. Plant vacuoles are found to be much more diverse in structure and function than previously thought. Some vacuoles contain their own hydrolytic enzymes and perform the classic lysosomal activity, which is autophagy. These vacuoles are therefore seen as fulfilling the role of the animal lysosome. Based on de Duve&#x27;s description that &quot;only when considered as part of a system involved directly or indirectly in intracellular digestion does the term lysosome describe a physiological unit&quot;, some botanists strongly argued that these vacuoles are lysosomes. However, this is not universally accepted as the vacuoles are strictly not similar to lysosomes, such as in their specific enzymes and lack of phagocytic functions. Vacuoles do not have catabolic activity and do not undergo exocytosis as lysosomes do.

<doc id="18121" wikidata="Q1480954" url="?curid=18121" title="Leg spin">
<text>Leg spin is a type of spin bowling in cricket. A bowler who uses this technique is called a leg spinner. Leg spinners bowl with their right-arm and a wrist spin action. The leg spinner&#x27;s normal delivery is called a leg break, which spins from right to left (from the bowler&#x27;s perspective) when the ball bounces on the pitch. For a right-handed batter, the ball breaks towards them from the leg side, hence the name &#x27;leg break&#x27;.

Leg spinners bowl mostly leg breaks, varying them by adjusting the line and length, and amount of side spin versus topspin of the deliveries. Leg spinners also typically use variations of flight by sometimes looping the ball in the air, allowing any cross-breeze and the aerodynamic effects of the spinning ball to cause the ball to dip and drift before bouncing and spinning or &quot;turning&quot;, sharply. Leg spinners also bowl other types of delivery, which spin differently, such as the googly.

The terms &#x27;leg spin&#x27;, &#x27;leg spinner&#x27;, &#x27;leg break&#x27; and &#x27;leggie&#x27; are used in slightly different ways by different sources.

The bowlers with the second- and fourth-highest number of wickets in the history of Test cricket, Shane Warne and Anil Kumble, respectively, were leg spinners. One famous example of leg spin is Warne&#x27;s Ball of the Century.

==History==
In the 1970s and 1980s, it was thought that leg spin would disappear from the game due to the success of West Indian, and later Australian teams, exclusively using fast bowlers. During this time Abdul Qadir of Pakistan was the highest-profile leg spinner in the world and is sometimes credited with &quot;keeping the art alive&quot;. However, leg spin has again become popular with cricket fans and a successful part of cricket teams, driven largely by the success of Shane Warne, beginning with his spectacular Ball of the Century to Mike Gatting in 1993.

==Comparison with other types of bowling==
A left-handed bowler who bowls with the same (wrist spin) action as a leg spinner is known as a left-arm unorthodox spin bowler. The ball itself spins in the opposite direction.

The same kind of trajectory, which spins from right to left on pitching, when performed by a left-arm bowler is known as left-arm orthodox spin bowling.

As with all spinners, leg spinners bowl the ball far more slowly (70–90 km/h or 45–55 mph) than fast bowlers. The fastest leg spinners will sometimes top 100 km/h (60 mph). While very difficult to bowl accurately, good leg spin is considered one of the most threatening types of bowling to bat against for a right-handed batter, since the flight and sharp turn make the ball&#x27;s movement extremely hard to read, and the turn away from the right-handed batter is more dangerous than the turn into the right-handed batter generated by an off spinner. Any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Alternatively, for a ball aimed outside the leg stump, the breaking may be so sharp that the ball goes behind a right-handed batter and hits the stumps – the batter is then said (informally) to be &quot;bowled around his or her legs&quot;. A left-handed batter has less difficulty facing leg spin bowling, because the ball moves in towards the batter&#x27;s body, meaning the batter&#x27;s legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge. This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batter out bowled or caught from a leg break.

Leg spin: Some sources make the term &#x27;leg spin&#x27; synonymous with leg break, implying that other deliveries bowled by a leg spinner do not count as &#x27;leg spin&#x27;. However, other sources use the term &#x27;leg spin&#x27; more widely, to include all deliveries bowled by a leg spinner, including non-leg break deliveries. 

Leg break: In the definition of a leg break, some sources actually include the bowler being a leg spinner, which implies that only leg spinners can bowl leg breaks; all leg breaks are bowled by leg spinners. Other sources do not include the bowler being a leg spinner in the definition of a leg break, and say a leg break is simply a delivery that spins from the legside to the offside, and so can also be bowled by other types of bowler. In this case, leg breaks are (only) mostly bowled by leg spinners.

Leg spinner: The term leg spinner can be used to mean either the bowler or the leg break delivery.

Leggie: The term leggie can also be used to mean either the bowler or the leg break delivery.

==Technique==
A leg break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger, giving the ball an anti-clockwise spin as seen from behind.

To grip the ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam parallel to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and the third and fourth fingers close together and rest against the side of the ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batter will see the hand with the palm facing towards them when the ball is released.
==Notable leg spin bowlers==

Players listed below have been included as they meet specific criteria which the general cricketing public would recognise as having achieved significant success in the art of leg spin bowling. For example: leading wicket-takers, and inventors of new deliveries.

* Shane Warne – 708 Test wickets (second all-time), one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century
* Bernard Bosanquet – credited with inventing the googly (also known as the &quot;Bosie&quot; in Australia)
* Robin Hobbs – the last English leg spin bowler to take 1,000 first-class wickets in his career. In all he took 1,099 with a best of 8 for 63 at an average of 27.09. 
* B. S. Chandrasekhar – took 16 five-wicket hauls
* Clarrie Grimmett – 216 Test wickets
* Anil Kumble – 619 Test wickets (currently 4th on the list of all-time Test cricket wicket takers), best bowling in an innings of 10/74 
* Abdul Qadir – took 10 wickets in a Test match on five occasions
* Tich Freeman - 3776 first-class wickets, the second of all time and the most of any leg spin bowler.

==Other deliveries bowled by leg spin bowlers==

Highly skilled leg spin bowlers are also able to bowl deliveries that behave unexpectedly, including the googly, which turns the opposite way to a normal leg break and the topspinner, which does not turn but dips sharply and bounces higher than other deliveries. A few leg spinners such as Abdul Qadir, Anil Kumble, Shane Warne and Mushtaq Ahmed have also mastered the flipper, a delivery that like a topspinner goes straight on landing, but floats through the air before skidding and keeping low, often dismissing batters leg before wicket or bowled. Another variation in the arsenal of some leg spinners is the slider, a leg break pushed out of the hand somewhat faster, so that it does not spin as much, but travels more straight on.

<text>Lisp machines are general-purpose computers designed to efficiently run Lisp as their main software and programming language, usually via hardware support. They are an example of a high-level language computer architecture. In a sense, they were the first commercial single-user workstations. Despite being modest in number (perhaps 7,000 units total as of 1988) Lisp machines commercially pioneered many now-commonplace technologies, including windowing systems, computer mice, high-resolution bit-mapped raster graphics, computer graphic rendering, laser printing, networking innovations such as Chaosnet, and effective garbage collection. Several firms built and sold Lisp machines in the 1980s: Symbolics (3600, 3640, XL1200, MacIvory, and other models), Lisp Machines Incorporated (LMI Lambda), Texas Instruments (Explorer, MicroExplorer), and Xerox (Interlisp-D workstations). The operating systems were written in Lisp Machine Lisp, Interlisp (Xerox), and later partly in Common Lisp.

==History==

===Historical context===
Artificial intelligence (AI) computer programs of the 1960s and 1970s intrinsically required what was then considered a huge amount of computer power, as measured in processor time and memory space. The power requirements of AI research were exacerbated by the Lisp symbolic programming language, when commercial hardware was designed and optimized for assembly- and Fortran-like programming languages. At first, the cost of such computer hardware meant that it had to be shared among many users. As integrated circuit technology shrank the size and cost of computers in the 1960s and early 1970s, and the memory needs of AI programs began to exceed the address space of the most common research computer, the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-10, researchers considered a new approach: a computer designed specifically to develop and run large artificial intelligence programs, and tailored to the semantics of the Lisp language. To keep the operating system (relatively) simple, these machines would often not be shared, but would be dedicated to a single user at a time.

===Initial development===

In 1973, Richard Greenblatt and Thomas Knight, programmers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab), began what would become the MIT Lisp Machine Project when they first began building a computer hardwired to run certain basic Lisp operations, rather than run them in software, in a 24-bit tagged architecture. The machine also did incremental (or &quot;Arena&quot;) garbage collection. More specifically, since Lisp variables are typed at runtime rather than compile time, a simple addition of two variables could take five times as long on conventional hardware, due to test and branch instructions. Lisp Machines ran the tests in parallel with the more conventional single instruction additions. If the simultaneous tests failed, then the result was discarded and recomputed; this meant in many cases a speed increase by several factors. This simultaneous checking approach was used as well in testing the bounds of arrays when referenced, and other memory management necessities (not merely garbage collection or arrays).

Type checking was further improved and automated when the conventional byte word of 32 bits was lengthened to 36 bits for Symbolics 3600-model Lisp machines and eventually to 40 bits or more (usually, the excess bits not accounted for by the following were used for error-correcting codes). The first group of extra bits were used to hold type data, making the machine a tagged architecture, and the remaining bits were used to implement CDR coding (wherein the usual linked list elements are compressed to occupy roughly half the space), aiding garbage collection by reportedly an order of magnitude. A further improvement was two microcode instructions which specifically supported Lisp functions, reducing the cost of calling a function to as little as 20 clock cycles, in some Symbolics implementations.

The first machine was called the CONS machine (named after the list construction operator codice_1 in Lisp). Often it was affectionately referred to as the &quot;Knight machine&quot;, perhaps since Knight wrote his master&#x27;s thesis on the subject; it was extremely well received. It was subsequently improved into a version called CADR (a pun; in Lisp, the codice_2 function, which returns the second item of a list, is pronounced or , as some pronounce the word &quot;cadre&quot;) which was based on essentially the same architecture. About 25 of what were essentially prototype CADRs were sold within and without MIT for ~$50,000; it quickly became the favorite machine for hacking many of the most favored software tools were quickly ported to it (e.g. Emacs was ported from ITS in 1975). It was so well received at an AI conference held at MIT in 1978 that Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began funding its development.

===Commercializing MIT Lisp machine technology===
In 1979, Russell Noftsker, being convinced that Lisp machines had a bright commercial future due to the strength of the Lisp language and the enabling factor of hardware acceleration, proposed to Greenblatt that they commercialize the technology. In a counter-intuitive move for an AI Lab hacker, Greenblatt acquiesced, hoping perhaps that he could recreate the informal and productive atmosphere of the Lab in a real business. These ideas and goals were considerably different from those of Noftsker. The two negotiated at length, but neither would compromise. As the proposed firm could succeed only with the full and undivided assistance of the AI Lab hackers as a group, Noftsker and Greenblatt decided that the fate of the enterprise was up to them, and so the choice should be left to the hackers.

The ensuing discussions of the choice divided the lab into two factions. In February 1979, matters came to a head. The hackers sided with Noftsker, believing that a commercial venture-fund-backed firm had a better chance of surviving and commercializing Lisp machines than Greenblatt&#x27;s proposed self-sustaining start-up. Greenblatt lost the battle.

It was at this juncture that Symbolics, Noftsker&#x27;s enterprise, slowly came together. While Noftsker was paying his staff a salary, he had no building or any equipment for the hackers to work on. He bargained with Patrick Winston that, in exchange for allowing Symbolics&#x27; staff to keep working out of MIT, Symbolics would let MIT use internally and freely all the software Symbolics developed. A consultant from CDC, who was trying to put together a natural language computer application with a group of West-coast programmers, came to Greenblatt, seeking a Lisp machine for his group to work with, about eight months after the disastrous conference with Noftsker. Greenblatt had decided to start his own rival Lisp machine firm, but he had done nothing. The consultant, Alexander Jacobson, decided that the only way Greenblatt was going to start the firm and build the Lisp machines that Jacobson desperately needed was if Jacobson pushed and otherwise helped Greenblatt launch the firm. Jacobson pulled together business plans, a board, a partner for Greenblatt (one F. Stephen Wyle). The newfound firm was named &quot;LISP Machine, Inc.&quot; (LMI), and was funded by CDC orders, via Jacobson.

Around this time Symbolics (Noftsker&#x27;s firm) began operating. It had been hindered by Noftsker&#x27;s promise to give Greenblatt a year&#x27;s head start, and by severe delays in procuring venture capital. Symbolics still had the major advantage that while 3 or 4 of the AI Lab hackers had gone to work for Greenblatt, 14 other hackers had signed onto Symbolics. Two AI Lab people were not hired by either: Richard Stallman and Marvin Minsky. Stallman, however, blamed Symbolics for the decline of the hacker community that had centered around the AI lab. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the Symbolics programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab&#x27;s computers.

Regardless, after a series of internal battles, Symbolics did get off the ground in 1980/1981, selling the CADR as the LM-2, while Lisp Machines, Inc. sold it as the LMI-CADR. Symbolics did not intend to produce many LM-2s, since the 3600 family of Lisp machines was supposed to ship quickly, but the 3600s were repeatedly delayed, and Symbolics ended up producing ~100 LM-2s, each of which sold for $70,000. Both firms developed second-generation products based on the CADR: the Symbolics 3600 and the LMI-LAMBDA (of which LMI managed to sell ~200). The 3600, which shipped a year late, expanded on the CADR by widening the machine word to 36-bits, expanding the address space to 28-bits, and adding hardware to accelerate certain common functions that were implemented in microcode on the CADR. The LMI-LAMBDA, which came out a year after the 3600, in 1983, was compatible with the CADR (it could run CADR microcode), but hardware differences existed. Texas Instruments (TI) joined the fray when it licensed the LMI-LAMBDA design and produced its own variant, the TI Explorer. Some of the LMI-LAMBDAs and the TI Explorer were dual systems with both a Lisp and a Unix processor. TI also developed a 32-bit microprocessor version of its Lisp CPU for the TI Explorer. This Lisp chip also was used for the MicroExplorer – a NuBus board for the Apple Macintosh II (NuBus was initially developed at MIT for use in Lisp machines).

Symbolics continued to develop the 3600 family and its operating system, Genera, and produced the Ivory, a VLSI implementation of the Symbolics architecture. Starting in 1987, several machines based on the Ivory processor were developed: boards for Suns and Macs, stand-alone workstations and even embedded systems (I-Machine Custom LSI, 32 bit address, Symbolics XL-400, UX-400, MacIvory II; in 1989 available platforms were Symbolics XL-1200, MacIvory III, UX-1200, Zora, NXP1000 &quot;pizza box&quot;). Texas Instruments shrank the Explorer into silicon as the MicroExplorer which was offered as a card for the Apple Mac II. LMI abandoned the CADR architecture and developed its own K-Machine, but LMI went bankrupt before the machine could be brought to market. Before its demise, LMI was working on a distributed system for the LAMBDA using Moby space.

These machines had hardware support for various primitive Lisp operations (data type testing, CDR coding) and also hardware support for incremental garbage collection. They ran large Lisp programs very efficiently. The Symbolics machine was competitive against many commercial super minicomputers, but was never adapted for conventional purposes. The Symbolics Lisp Machines were also sold to some non-AI markets like computer graphics, modeling, and animation.

The MIT-derived Lisp machines ran a Lisp dialect named Lisp Machine Lisp, descended from MIT&#x27;s Maclisp. The operating systems were written from the ground up in Lisp, often using object-oriented extensions. Later, these Lisp machines also supported various versions of Common Lisp (with Flavors, New Flavors, and Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)).

===Interlisp, BBN, and Xerox=== 
Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) developed its own Lisp machine, named Jericho, which ran a version of Interlisp. It was never marketed. Frustrated, the whole AI group resigned, and were hired mostly by Xerox. So, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center had, simultaneously with Greenblatt&#x27;s own development at MIT, developed their own Lisp machines which were designed to run InterLisp (and later Common Lisp). The same hardware was used with different software also as Smalltalk machines and as the Xerox Star office system. These included the Xerox 1100, &quot;Dolphin&quot; (1979); the Xerox 1132, &quot;Dorado&quot;; the Xerox 1108, &quot;Dandelion&quot; (1981); the Xerox 1109, &quot;Dandetiger&quot;; and the Xerox 1186/6085, &quot;Daybreak&quot;. The operating system of the Xerox Lisp machines has also been ported to a virtual machine and is available for several platforms as a product named &quot;Medley&quot;. The Xerox machine was well known for its advanced development environment (InterLisp-D), the ROOMS window manager, for its early graphical user interface and for novel applications like NoteCards (one of the first hypertext applications).

Xerox also worked on a Lisp machine based on reduced instruction set computing (RISC), using the &#x27;Xerox Common Lisp Processor&#x27; and planned to bring it to market by 1987, which did not occur.

===Integrated Inference Machines===
In the mid-1980s, Integrated Inference Machines (IIM) built prototypes of Lisp machines named Inferstar.

===Developments of Lisp machines outside the United States===
In 1984–85 a UK firm, Racal-Norsk, a joint subsidiary of Racal and Norsk Data, attempted to repurpose Norsk Data&#x27;s ND-500 supermini as a microcoded Lisp machine, running CADR software: the Knowledge Processing System (KPS).

There were several attempts by Japanese manufacturers to enter the Lisp machine market: the Fujitsu Facom-alpha mainframe co-processor, NTT&#x27;s Elis, Toshiba&#x27;s AI processor (AIP) and NEC&#x27;s LIME. Several university research efforts produced working prototypes, among them are Kobe University&#x27;s TAKITAC-7, RIKEN&#x27;s FLATS, and Osaka University&#x27;s EVLIS.

In France, two Lisp Machine projects arose: M3L at Toulouse Paul Sabatier University and later MAIA.

In Germany Siemens designed the RISC-based Lisp co-processor COLIBRI.

===End of the Lisp machines===
With the onset of the &quot;AI winter&quot; and the early beginnings of the microcomputer revolution, which would sweep away the minicomputer and workstation makers, cheaper desktop PCs soon could run Lisp programs even faster than Lisp machines, with no use of special purpose hardware. Their high profit margin hardware business eliminated, most Lisp machine makers had gone out of business by the early 90s, leaving only software based firms like Lucid Inc. or hardware makers who had switched to software and services to avoid the crash. , besides Xerox and TI, Symbolics is the only Lisp machine firm still operating, selling the Open Genera Lisp machine software environment and the Macsyma computer algebra system.

===Legacy===
Several attempts to write open-source emulators for various Lisp Machines have been made: CADR Emulation, Symbolics L Lisp Machine Emulation, the E3 Project (TI Explorer II Emulation), Meroko (TI Explorer I), and Nevermore (TI Explorer I). On 3 October 2005, the MIT released the CADR Lisp Machine source code as open source.

In September 2014, Alexander Burger, developer of PicoLisp, announced PilMCU, an implementation of PicoLisp in hardware.

The Bitsavers&#x27; PDF Document Archive has PDF versions of the extensive documentation for the Symbolics Lisp Machines, the TI Explorer and MicroExplorer Lisp Machines and the Xerox Interlisp-D Lisp Machines.

===Applications===

Domains using the Lisp machines were mostly in the wide field of artificial intelligence applications, but also in computer graphics, medical image processing, and many others.

The main commercial expert systems of the 80s were available: Intellicorp&#x27;s Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE), Knowledge Craft, from The Carnegie Group Inc., and ART (Automated Reasoning Tool) from Inference Corporation.

==Technical overview==

Initially the Lisp machines were designed as personal workstations for software development in Lisp. They were used by one person and offered no multi-user mode. The machines provided a large, black and white, bitmap display, keyboard and mouse, network adapter, local hard disks, more than 1 MB RAM, serial interfaces, and a local bus for extension cards. Color graphics cards, tape drives, and laser printers were optional.

The processor did not run Lisp directly, but was a stack machine with instructions optimized for compiled Lisp. The early Lisp machines used microcode to provide the instruction set. For several operations, type checking and dispatching was done in hardware at runtime. For example, only one addition operation could be used with various numeric types (integer, float, rational, and complex numbers). The result was a very compact compiled representation of Lisp code.

The following example uses a function that counts the number of elements of a list for which a predicate returns codice_3.
(defun example-count (predicate list)
 (let ((count 0))
 (dolist (i list count)
 (when (funcall predicate i)
 (incf count)))))
The disassembled machine code for above function (for the Ivory microprocessor from Symbolics):
Command: (disassemble (compile #&#x27;example-count))

 2 PUSH 0 ;Creating COUNT
 3 PUSH FP|3 ;LIST
 4 PUSH NIL ;Creating I

 11 PUSH FP|6 ;I
 12 FINISH-CALL-1-VALUE
 13 BRANCH-FALSE 15
 14 INCREMENT FP|4 ;COUNT
 15 ENDP FP|5
 16 BRANCH-FALSE 6
 17 SET-SP-TO-ADDRESS SP|-2
 20 RETURN-SINGLE-STACK
The operating system used virtual memory to provide a large address space. Memory management was done with garbage collection. All code shared a single address space. All data objects were stored with a tag in memory, so that the type could be determined at runtime. Multiple execution threads were supported and termed &quot;processes&quot;. All processes ran in the one address space.

All operating system software was written in Lisp. Xerox used Interlisp. Symbolics, LMI, and TI used Lisp Machine Lisp (descendant of MacLisp). With the appearance of Common Lisp, Common Lisp was supported on the Lisp Machines and some system software was ported to Common Lisp or later written in Common Lisp.

Some later Lisp machines (like the TI MicroExplorer, the Symbolics MacIvory or the Symbolics UX400/1200) were no longer complete workstations, but boards designed to be embedded in host computers: Apple Macintosh II and Sun-3 or Sun-4.

Some Lisp machines, such as the Symbolics XL1200, had extensive graphics abilities using special graphics boards. These machines were used in domains like medical image processing, 3D animation, and CAD.

<doc id="18125" wikidata="Q608910" url="?curid=18125" title="Links (web browser)">
<text>Links is a free software text and graphical web browser with a pull-down menu system. It renders complex pages, has partial HTML 4.0 support (including tables, frames, and support for UTF-8), supports color and monochrome terminals, and allows horizontal scrolling.

It is intended for users who want to retain many typical elements of graphical user interfaces (pop-up windows, menus, etc.) in a text-only environment.

The original version of Links was developed by Mikuláš Patočka in the Czech Republic. His group, &quot;&quot;Twibright Labs&quot;,&quot; later developed version 2 of the Links browser, which displays graphics, and renders fonts in different sizes (with spatial anti-aliasing), but no longer supports JavaScript (it used to, up to version 2.1pre28). The resulting browser is very fast, but does not display many pages as intended. The graphical mode works even on Unix systems without the X Window System or any other window environment, using either SVGAlib or the framebuffer of the system&#x27;s graphics card.

==Graphics stacked ==

The graphics stack varies from a stack typically used by a web browser. The fonts displayed by Links are not derived from the system, but compiled into binary as grayscale bitmaps using the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format. This allows the browser to be distributed as a single executable file, independent of the system&#x27;s installed libraries. However, this raises the size of the executable to approximately 5 MB. The fonts are anti-aliased without hinting, and for small line pitches, artificial sharpening is used to increase legibility. Sub-pixel sampling is used to further improve legibility on LCD displays. These techniques allow Links to use anti-aliased fonts when libraries for rendering them are not available.

All graphic elements (images and text) are first converted from a given gamma space (according to known or assumed gamma information in PNG, JPEG, etc.) through known user gamma setting into a 48 bits pixel photometrically linear space where they are re-sampled with bilinear re-sampling to the target size, possibly taking aspect ratio correction into account. Then the image data are passed through a high-performance dithering engine, which is used regardless of monitor bit depth, i.e., it is still used with 24 bits per pixel color. This implementation of a Floyd-Steinberg dithering engine avoids time expensive calculations by considering the gamma characteristics of the monitor, using 768 KiB of dithering tables. A technique similar to self-modifying code, called function templates, is used to maximise the speed of the dithering engine without using assembly language optimization.

Scaled down images also use sub-pixel sampling on LCD to increase the level of detail.

This processing is used to provide realistic up and downsampling of images, and photorealistic display regardless of the monitor&#x27;s gamma, without color fringing caused by 8-bit gamma correction built into the X server.

==Forks==
===ELinks===

&quot;Experimental/Enhanced Links&quot; (ELinks) is a fork of Links led by Petr Baudis. It is based on Links 0.9. It has a more open development and incorporates patches from other Links versions (such as additional extension scripting in Lua) and from Internet users.

===Hacked Links===
&quot;Hacked Links&quot; is another version of the Links browser which has merged some of Elinks&#x27; features into Links 2.

Andrey Mirtchovski has ported it to Plan 9 from Bell Labs. It is considered a good browser on that operating system, though some users have complained about its inability to cut and paste with the Plan 9 snarf buffer.

, the last release of Hacked Links is that of July 9, 2003, with some further changes unreleased.

===Other===
Links was also ported to run on the Sony PSP platform as PSPRadio by Rafael Cabezas with the last version (2.1pre23_PSP_r1261) released on February 6, 2007.

The BeOS port was updated by François Revol who also added GUI support. It also runs on Haiku.

The concept encompassed by &#x27;Learning Objects&#x27; is known by numerous other terms, including: content objects, chunks, educational objects, information objects, intelligent objects, knowledge bits, knowledge objects, learning components, media objects, reusable curriculum components, nuggets, reusable information objects, reusable learning objects, testable reusable units of cognition, training components, and units of learning.

The core idea of the use of learning objects is characterized by the following: discoverability, reusability, and interoperability. To support discoverability, learning objects are described by Learning Object Metadata, formalized as IEEE 1484.12 Learning object metadata. To support reusability, the IMS Consortium proposed a series of specifications such as the IMS Content package. And to support interoperability, the U.S. military&#x27;s Advanced Distributed Learning organization created the Sharable Content Object Reference Model. Learning objects were designed in order to reduce the cost of learning, standardize learning content, and to enable the use and reuse of learning content by learning management systems.

==Definitions==
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines a learning object as &quot;any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training&quot;.

Chiappe defined Learning Objects as: &quot;A digital self-contained and reusable entity, with a clear educational purpose, with at least three internal and editable components: content, learning activities and elements of context. The learning objects must have an external structure of information to facilitate their identification, storage and retrieval: the metadata.&quot;

The following definitions focus on the relation between learning object and digital media. RLO-CETL, a British inter-university Learning Objects Center, defines &quot;reusable learning objects&quot; as &quot;web-based interactive chunks of e-learning designed to explain a stand-alone learning objective&quot;. Daniel Rehak and Robin Mason define it as &quot;a digitized entity which can be used, reused or referenced during technology supported learning&quot;.

Adapting a definition from the Wisconsin Online Resource Center, Robert J. Beck suggests that learning objects have the following key characteristics:

* Learning objects are a new way of thinking about learning content. Traditionally, content comes in a several hour chunk. Learning objects are much smaller units of learning, typically ranging from 2 minutes to 15 minutes.
* Are self-contained – each learning object can be taken independently
* Are reusable – a single learning object may be used in multiple contexts for multiple purposes
* Can be aggregated – learning objects can be grouped into larger collections of content, including traditional course structures
* Are tagged with metadata – every learning object has descriptive information allowing it to be easily found by a search

== Components ==
The following is a list of some of the types of information that may be included in a learning object and its metadata:
* General Course Descriptive Data, including: course identifiers, language of content (English, Spanish, etc.), subject area (Maths, Reading, etc.), descriptive text, descriptive keywords
* Life Cycle, including: version, status
* Instructional Content, including: text, web pages, images, sound, video
* Glossary of Terms, including: terms, definition, acronyms
* Quizzes and Assessments, including: questions, answers
* Rights, including: cost, copyrights, restrictions on Use
* Relationships to Other Courses, including prerequisite courses
* Educational Level, including: grade level, age range, typical learning time, and difficulty. [IEEE 1484.12.1:2002]
*Typology as defined by Churchill (2007): presentation, practice, simulation, conceptual models, information, and contextual representation 

==Metadata==
One of the key issues in using learning objects is their identification by search engines or content management systems. This is usually facilitated by assigning descriptive learning object metadata. Just as a book in a library has a record in the card catalog, learning objects must also be tagged with metadata. The most important pieces of metadata typically associated with a learning object include:
# objective: The educational objective the learning object is instructing
# prerequisites: The list of skills (typically represented as objectives) which the learner must know before viewing the learning object
# topic: Typically represented in a taxonomy, the topic the learning object is instructing
# interactivity: The Interaction Model of the learning object.
# technology requirements: The required system requirements to view the learning object.

==Mutability==

A mutated learning object is, according to Michael S. Shaw, MSc (2003), a learning object that has been &quot;re-purposed and/or re-engineered, changed or simply re-used in some way different from its original intended design&quot;. In other words, educational content or learning materials, initially designed for a specific domain, may be intentionally or unintentionally, repurposed or applied, or become relevant in some significant way to the learner or situation, even though it is from a totally different domain. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the inherent properties of the learning objects remain constant, but their application becomes beneficial and adaptable across diverse domains. Shaw&#x27;s speculative interpretation suggests an intrinsic stimulation of cognitive flexibility and creative reuse of learning resources for the learner. Shaw also introduces the term &quot;contextual learning object&quot;, to describe a learning object with high specificity, that has been &quot;designed to have specific meaning and purpose to an intended learner&quot;. This may be useful if the intent involves just-in-time learning and the individual needs of individual learners.

==Portability==
Before any institution invests a great deal of time and energy into building high-quality e-learning content (which can cost over $10,000 per classroom hour), it needs to consider how this content can be easily loaded into a Learning Management System. It is possible for example, to package learning objects with SCORM specification and load it in Moodle Learning Management System or Desire2Learn Learning Environment.

If all of the properties of a course can be precisely defined in a common format, the content can be serialized into a standard format such as XML and loaded into other systems. When it is considered that some e-learning courses need to include video, mathematical equations using MathML, chemistry equations using CML and other complex structures, the issues become very complex, especially if the systems needs to understand and validate each structure and then place it correctly in a database.

==Criticism==
In 2001, David Wiley criticized learning object theory in his paper, The Reusability Paradox which is summarized by D&#x27;Arcy Norman as, &quot;If a learning object is useful in a particular context, by definition it is not reusable in a different context. If a learning object is reusable in many contexts, it isn’t particularly useful in any.&quot; 
In Three Objections to Learning Objects and E-learning Standards , Norm Friesen, Canada Research Chair in E-Learning Practices at Thompson Rivers University, points out that the word &quot;neutrality&quot; in itself implies &quot;a state or position that is antithetical ... to pedagogy and teaching.&quot;

<text>The name &quot;Labour Party&quot; (or &quot;Labor Party&quot;) is used by political parties around the world, particularly in Commonwealth nations. Historically, these parties are associated with democratic socialism, although not exclusively. Over time, most have evolved into social democratic parties. They are traditionally allied with trade unions and the broader labour movement. Many Labour parties are also members of the Socialist International or participants in the Progressive Alliance.

<doc id="18130" wikidata="Q1588" url="?curid=18130" title="Louisiana">
<text>Louisiana ( ; ; ) is a state in the Deep South and South Central regions of the United States. It borders Texas to the west, Arkansas to the north, and Mississippi to the east. Of the 50 U.S. states, it ranks 31st in area and 25th in population, with roughly 4.6 million residents. Reflecting its French heritage, Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are equivalent to counties, making it one of only two U.S. states not subdivided into counties (the other being Alaska and its boroughs). Baton Rouge is the state&#x27;s capital, and New Orleans, a French Louisiana region, is its largest city with a population of about 383,000 people. Louisiana has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the south; a large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River.

Much of Louisiana&#x27;s lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota, including birds such as ibises and egrets, many species of tree frogs—such as the state-recognized American green tree frog—and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. More elevated areas, particularly in the north, contain a wide variety of ecosystems such as tallgrass prairie, longleaf pine forest and wet savannas; these support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of terrestrial orchids and carnivorous plants. Over half the state is forested.

Louisiana is situated at the confluence of the Mississippi river system and the Gulf of Mexico. Its location and biodiversity attracted various indigenous groups thousands of years before Europeans arrived in the 17th century. Louisiana has eighteen Native American tribes—the most of any southern state—of which four are federally recognized and ten are state-recognized. The French claimed the territory in 1682, and it became the political, commercial, and population center of the larger colony of New France. From 1762 to 1801 Louisiana was under Spanish rule, briefly returning to French rule before being sold by Napoleon to the U.S. in 1803. It was admitted to the Union in 1812 as the 18th state. Following statehood, Louisiana saw an influx of settlers from the eastern U.S. as well as immigrants from the West Indies, Germany, and Ireland. It experienced an agricultural boom, particularly in cotton and sugarcane, which were cultivated primarily by slaves from Africa. As a slave state, Louisiana was one of the original seven members of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.

Louisiana&#x27;s unique French heritage is reflected in its toponyms, dialects, culture, demographics, and legal system. Relative to the rest of the southern U.S., Louisiana is multilingual and multicultural, reflecting an admixture of Louisiana French (Cajun, Creole), Spanish, French Canadian, Acadian, Saint-Domingue Creole, Native American, and West African cultures (generally the descendants of slaves stolen in the 18th century); more recent migrants include Filipinos and Vietnamese. In the post–Civil War environment, Anglo-Americans increased the pressure for Anglicization, and in 1921, English was shortly made the sole language of instruction in Louisiana schools before a policy of multilingualism was revived in 1974. Louisiana has never had an official language, and the state constitution enumerates &quot;the right of the people to preserve, foster, and promote their respective historic, linguistic, and cultural origins.&quot;

Based on national averages, Louisiana frequently ranks low among U.S. states in terms of health, education, and development, with high rates of poverty and homicide. In 2018, Louisiana was ranked as the least healthy state in the country, with high levels of drug-related deaths. It also has had the highest homicide rate in the United States since at least the 1990s.

==Etymology==
Louisiana was named after Louis XIV, King of France from 1643 to 1715. When René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle claimed the territory drained by the Mississippi River for France, he named it . The suffix –ana (or –ane) is a Latin suffix that can refer to &quot;information relating to a particular individual, subject, or place.&quot; Thus, roughly, Louis + ana carries the idea of &quot;related to Louis.&quot; Once part of the French colonial empire, the Louisiana Territory stretched from present-day Mobile Bay to just north of the present-day Canada–United States border, including a small part of what are now the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

==History==
=== Pre–colonial history ===
The area of Louisiana is the place of origin of the Mound Builders culture during the Middle Archaic period, in the 4th millennium BC. The sites of Caney and Frenchman&#x27;s Bend have been securely dated to 5600–5000 BP (about 3700–3100 BC), demonstrating that seasonal hunter-gatherers from around this time organized to build complex earthwork constructions in what is now northern Louisiana. The Watson Brake site near present-day Monroe has an eleven-mound complex; it was built about 5400 BP (3500 BC). These discoveries overturned previous assumptions in archaeology that such complex mounds were built only by cultures of more settled peoples who were dependent on maize cultivation. The Hedgepeth Site in Lincoln Parish is more recent, dated to 5200–4500 BP (3300–2600 BC).
Nearly 2,000 years later, Poverty Point was built; it is the largest and best-known Late Archaic site in the state. The city of modern–day Epps developed near it. The Poverty Point culture may have reached its peak around 1500 BC, making it the first complex culture, and possibly the first tribal culture in North America. It lasted until approximately 700 BC.

The Poverty Point culture was followed by the Tchefuncte and Lake Cormorant cultures of the Tchula period, local manifestations of Early Woodland period. The Tchefuncte culture were the first people in the area of Louisiana to make large amounts of pottery. These cultures lasted until 200 AD. The Middle Woodland period started in Louisiana with the Marksville culture in the southern and eastern part of the state, reaching across the Mississippi River to the east around Natchez, and the Fourche Maline culture in the northwestern part of the state. The Marksville culture was named after the Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site in Avoyelles Parish.
These cultures were contemporaneous with the Hopewell cultures of present-day Ohio and Illinois, and participated in the Hopewell Exchange Network. Trade with peoples to the southwest brought the bow and arrow. The first burial mounds were built at this time. Political power began to be consolidated, as the first platform mounds at ritual centers were constructed for the developing hereditary political and religious leadership.

By 400 the Late Woodland period had begun with the Baytown culture, Troyville culture, and Coastal Troyville during the Baytown period and were succeeded by the Coles Creek cultures. Where the Baytown peoples built dispersed settlements, the Troyville people instead continued building major earthwork centers. Population increased dramatically and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity. Many Coles Creek sites were erected over earlier Woodland period mortuary mounds. Scholars have speculated that emerging elites were symbolically and physically appropriating dead ancestors to emphasize and project their own authority.

The Mississippian period in Louisiana was when the Plaquemine and the Caddoan Mississippian cultures developed, and the peoples adopted extensive maize agriculture, cultivating different strains of the plant by saving seeds, selecting for certain characteristics, etc. The Plaquemine culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana began in 1200 and continued to about 1600. Examples in Louisiana include the Medora site, the archaeological type site for the culture in West Baton Rouge Parish whose characteristics helped define the culture, the Atchafalaya Basin Mounds in St. Mary Parish, the Fitzhugh Mounds in Madison Parish, the Scott Place Mounds in Union Parish, and the Sims site in St. Charles Parish.

Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture that is represented by its largest settlement, the Cahokia site in Illinois east of St. Louis, Missouri. At its peak Cahokia is estimated to have had a population of more than 20,000. The Plaquemine culture is considered ancestral to the historic Natchez and Taensa peoples, whose descendants encountered Europeans in the colonial era.

By 1000 in the northwestern part of the state, the Fourche Maline culture had evolved into the Caddoan Mississippian culture. The Caddoan Mississippians occupied a large territory, including what is now eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, northeast Texas, and northwest Louisiana. Archaeological evidence has demonstrated that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present. The Caddo and related Caddo-language speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact were the direct ancestors of the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma of today. Significant Caddoan Mississippian archaeological sites in Louisiana include Belcher Mound Site in Caddo Parish and Gahagan Mounds Site in Red River Parish.

Many current place names in Louisiana, including Atchafalaya, Natchitouches (now spelled Natchitoches), Caddo, Houma, Tangipahoa, and Avoyel (as Avoyelles), are transliterations of those used in various Native American languages.

===Exploration and colonization by Europeans===
The first European explorers to visit Louisiana came in 1528 when a Spanish expedition led by Pánfilo de Narváez located the mouth of the Mississippi River. In 1542, Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition skirted to the north and west of the state (encountering Caddo and Tunica groups) and then followed the Mississippi River down to the Gulf of Mexico in 1543. Spanish interest in Louisiana faded away for a century and a half.

In the late 17th century, French and French Canadian expeditions, which included sovereign, religious and commercial aims, established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast. With its first settlements, France laid claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada.

In 1682, the French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle named the region Louisiana to honor King Louis XIV of France. The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (now Ocean Springs, Mississippi), was founded in 1699 by Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville, a French military officer from New France. By then the French had also built a small fort at the mouth of the Mississippi at a settlement they named La Balise (or La Balize), &quot;seamark&quot; in French. By 1721, they built a wooden lighthouse-type structure here to guide ships on the river.

A royal ordinance of 1722—following the Crown&#x27;s transfer of the Illinois Country&#x27;s governance from Canada to Louisiana—may have featured the broadest definition of Louisiana: all land claimed by France south of the Great Lakes between the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies. A generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general Vaudreuil set the northern and eastern bounds of his domain as the Wabash valley up to the mouth of the Vermilion River (near present-day Danville, Illinois); from there, northwest to &quot;le Rocher&quot; on the Illinois River, and from there west to the mouth of the Rock River (at present day Rock Island, Illinois). Thus, Vincennes and Peoria were the limit of Louisiana&#x27;s reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (on the upper Wabash near present-day Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana), and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, operated as dependencies of Canada.

The settlement of Natchitoches (along the Red River in present-day northwest Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the modern state of Louisiana. The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in Texas via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.
Louisiana&#x27;s French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the Illinois Country, around present-day St. Louis, Missouri. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.

Initially, Mobile and then Biloxi served as the capital of La Louisiane. Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.

In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the German Coast.

France ceded most of its territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of Britain&#x27;s victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War (generally referred to in North America as the French and Indian War). This included the lands along the Gulf Coast and north of Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River, which became known as British West Florida. The rest of Louisiana west of the Mississippi, as well as the &quot;isle of New Orleans&quot;, had become a colony of Spain by the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762). The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.

In 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand Acadians from the French colony of Acadia (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island) made their way to Louisiana after having been expelled from Acadia by the British government after the French and Indian War. They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called Acadiana. The governor Luis de Unzaga y Amézaga, eager to gain more settlers, welcomed the Acadians, who became the ancestors of Louisiana&#x27;s Cajuns.

Spanish Canary Islanders, called Isleños, emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783. In 1800, France&#x27;s Napoleon Bonaparte reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for two years.

===Expansion of slavery===
Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier Antoine Crozat obtained a monopoly of commerce in La Louisiane, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois. According to historian Hugh Thomas, &quot;that concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year&quot;.
Starting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the &quot;Du Maine&quot; and the &quot;Aurore&quot;, arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.

In 1724, the French government issued a law called the Code Noir (&quot;Black Code&quot; in English) which regulated the interaction of whites (blancs) and blacks (noirs) in its colony of Louisiana (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). After the Sale of Louisiana, French Law survived in the Louisiana, such as the prohibition and outlaw of any cruel punishment.

Fugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements. The word &quot;maroon&quot; comes from the Spanish &quot;cimarron&quot;, meaning which means &quot;fierce&quot; or &quot;unruly.&quot;

In the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:

When the United States purchased Louisiana in 1803, it was soon accepted that slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring Mississippi, though it violated U.S. law to do so. Despite demands by United States Rep. James Hillhouse and by the pamphleteer Thomas Paine to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.

At the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. William C. C. Claiborne, Louisiana&#x27;s first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers &quot;cannot be had in this unhealthy climate.&quot; Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain enacted in 1807. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade—the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.

By 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state. New Orleans had become one of the wealthiest cities, and the third largest city, in the nation. The ban on the African slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market. During the decades after the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved African Americans underwent forced migration from the Upper South to the Deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade. Others were transported by their owners as slaveholders moved west for new lands.

With changing agriculture in the Upper South as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had excess laborers. Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the coastwise slave trade. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.

Unusually for a slave-state, Louisiana harbored escaped Filipino slaves from the Manila Galleons. The members of the Filipino community were then commonly referred to as &quot;Manila men,&quot; or &quot;Manilamen,&quot; and later &quot;Tagalas&quot;, as they were free when they created the oldest settlement of Asians in the United States in the village of Saint Malo, Louisiana, the inhabitants of which, even joined the United States in the War of 1812 against the British Empire while they were being led by the French-American Jean Lafitte.

===Asylum and influence of Creoles from Saint-Domingue===
Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800. Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from Saint-Domingue as refugees poured over following a slave rebellion that started during the French Revolution of Saint-Domingue in 1791. Over the next decade, thousands of refugees landed in Louisiana from the island, including Europeans, Creoles, and Africans, some of the latter brought in by each free group. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city.

Anglo-American officials initially made attempts to keep out the additional Creoles of color, but the Louisiana Creoles wanted to increase the Creole population: more than half of the refugees eventually settled in Louisiana, and the majority remained in New Orleans.

Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) said: &quot;Saint-Domingue was, of all our colonies in the Antilles, the one whose mentality and customs influenced Louisiana the most.&quot;
===Purchase by the United States===

When the United States won its independence from Great Britain in 1783, one of its major concerns was having a European power on its western boundary, and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River. As American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachian Mountains provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a flatboat to float it down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below Natchez.

Napoleon&#x27;s ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the Caribbean sugar trade. By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain returned control of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after the Haitian Revolution. When the army led by Napoleon&#x27;s brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.
Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon&#x27;s plans to re-establish French colonies in North America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, U.S. minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the city of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2million.

An official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon&#x27;s deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, acting intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed James Monroe a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10million.

However, on April 11, 1803, French foreign minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the entirety of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston&#x27;s instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of for sixty million Francs (approximately $15million).

Part of this sum, $3.5million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States. The payment was made in United States bonds, which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of Hope and Company, and the British banking house of Baring, at a discount of per each $100 unit. As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker Alexander Baring conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money—which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring&#x27;s own country.
When news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson&#x27;s political opponents in the Federalist Party argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert, and that the U.S. constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or negotiating treaties without the consent of the federal legislature. What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening western and southern interests in U.S. Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.

By statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance. A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. The Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific Ocean.

Shortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the Territory of Orleans to the south and the District of Louisiana (subsequently formed as the Louisiana Territory) to the north.

===Statehood===
Louisiana became the eighteenth U.S. state on April 30, 1812; the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Territory was simultaneously renamed the Missouri Territory.

At its creation, the state of Louisiana did not include the area north and east of the Mississippi River known as the Florida Parishes. On April 14, 1812, Congress had authorized Louisiana to expand its borders to include the Florida Parishes, but the border change required approval of the state legislature, which it did not give until August 4. For the roughly three months in between, the northern border of eastern Louisiana was the course of Bayou Manchac and the middle of Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain.

From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a distinct two-party system, with Democrats competing first against Whigs, then Know Nothings, and finally only other Democrats.

===Secession and the Civil War===


According to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, nearly 47% of the state&#x27;s total population of 708,002. The strong economic interest of elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana&#x27;s decision to secede from the Union on January 26, 1861. It followed other U.S. states in seceding after the election of Abraham Lincoln as president of the United States. Louisiana&#x27;s secession was announced on January 26, 1861, and it became part of the Confederate States of America.

The state was quickly defeated in the Civil War, a result of Union strategy to cut the Confederacy in two by controlling the Mississippi River. Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862. Because a large part of the population had Union sympathies (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives to the U.S. Congress.

=== Post–Civil War to mid–20th century ===

Following the American Civil War and emancipation of slaves, violence rose in the southern U.S. as the war was carried on by insurgent private and paramilitary groups. During the initial period after the war, there was a massive rise in black participation in terms of voting and holding political office. Louisiana saw the United States&#x27; first and second black governors with Oscar Dunn and P.B.S. Pinchback, with 125 black members of the state legislature being elected during this time, while Charles E. Nash was elected to represent the state&#x27;s 6th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Eventually former Confederates came to dominate the state legislature after the end of Reconstruction and federal occupation in the late 1870s, and black codes were implemented to regulate freedmen and increasingly restricted the right to vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).

Following the Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans riot the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with Texas in what was administered as the Fifth Military District.

African Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both freedmen and people of color who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy, first in Ku Klux Klan chapters.

By 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi&#x27;s example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively disfranchised people of color by raising barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.
The state population in 1900 was 47% African American: a total of 652,013 citizens. Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizeable population of free people of color before the Civil War. By 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state. Because of disfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color. Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries. White Democrats had established one-party Democratic rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after congressional passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote.
In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings. The boll weevil infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs. The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers. Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went west to California for jobs in its expanding defense industries.

In 1920 the state had no continuous paved roads running east to west or north to south which traversed the entire state.

During some of the Great Depression, Louisiana was led by Governor Huey Long. He was elected to office on populist appeal. His public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he supported education and increased suffrage for poor whites, but Long was criticized for his allegedly demagogic and autocratic style. He extended patronage control through every branch of Louisiana&#x27;s state government. Especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state. Long&#x27;s rule ended abruptly when he was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935.

=== Mid–20th century to present ===
Mobilization for World War II created jobs in the state. But thousands of other workers, black and white alike, migrated to California for better jobs in its burgeoning defense industry. Many African Americans left the state in the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s through the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs. The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in California, better education for their children, and living in communities where they could vote.

On November 26, 1958, at Chennault Air Force Base, a USAF B-47 bomber with a nuclear weapon on board developed a fire while on the ground. The aircraft wreckage and the site of the accident were contaminated after a limited explosion of non-nuclear material.

In the 1950s the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration. Despite opposition by the States&#x27; Rights Party (Dixiecrats), downstate black voters had begun to increase their rate of registration, which also reflected the growth of their middle classes. In 1960 the state established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission, to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation.

Despite this, gradually black voter registration and turnout increased to 20% and more, and it was 32% by 1964, when the first national civil rights legislation of the era was passed. The percentage of black voters ranged widely in the state during these years, from 93.8% in Evangeline Parish to 1.7% in Tensas Parish, for instance, where there were intense white efforts to suppress the vote in the black-majority parish.

Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill towns were catalysts to the founding of the first two chapters of the Deacons for Defense and Justice in late 1964 and early 1965, in Jonesboro and Bogalusa, respectively. Made up of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, they were armed self-defense groups established to protect activists and their families. Continued violent white resistance in Bogalusa to blacks trying to use public facilities in 1965, following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, caused the federal government to order local police to protect the activists. Other chapters were formed in Mississippi and Alabama.

By 1960 the proportion of African Americans in Louisiana had dropped to 32%. The 1,039,207 black citizens were still suppressed by segregation and disfranchisement. African Americans continued to suffer disproportionate discriminatory application of the state&#x27;s voter registration rules. Because of better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970, blacks continued to migrate out of Louisiana, for a net loss of more than 37,000 people. Based on official census figures, the African American population in 1970 stood at 1,085,109, a net gain of more than 46,000 people compared to 1960. During the latter period, some people began to migrate to cities of the New South for opportunities. Since that period, blacks entered the political system and began to be elected to office, as well as having other opportunities.

On May 21, 1919, the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, giving women full rights to vote, was passed at a national level, and was made the law throughout the United States on August 18, 1920. Louisiana finally ratified the amendment on June 11, 1970.
Due to its location on the Gulf Coast, Louisiana has regularly suffered the effects of tropical storms and damaging hurricanes. On August 29, 2005, New Orleans and many other low-lying parts of the state along the Gulf of Mexico were hit by the catastrophic Hurricane Katrina. It caused widespread damage due to breaching of levees and large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city. Officials had issued warnings to evacuate the city and nearby areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, stayed behind, many of them stranded. Many people died and survivors suffered through the damage of the widespread floodwaters.

In July 2016 the shooting of Alton Sterling sparked protests throughout the state capital of Baton Rouge. In August 2016, an unnamed storm dumped trillions of gallons of rain on southern Louisiana, including the cities of Denham Springs, Baton Rouge, Gonzales, St. Amant and Lafayette, causing catastrophic flooding. An estimated 110,000 homes were damaged and thousands of residents were displaced. In 2019, three Louisiana black churches were destroyed by arson.

The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was announced on March 9, 2020. As of October 27, 2020, there had been 180,069 confirmed cases; 5,854 people have died of COVID-19.

==Geography==


Louisiana is bordered to the west by Texas; to the north by Arkansas; to the east by Mississippi; and to the south by the Gulf of Mexico. The state may properly be divided into two parts, the uplands of the north (the region of North Louisiana), and the alluvial along the coast (the Central Louisiana, Acadiana, Florida Parishes, and Greater New Orleans regions). The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and barrier islands that cover about . This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River, which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; also in the state are the Red River; the Ouachita River and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous).

The breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is , and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a levee), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.

The higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than . They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50–60 feet (15–18m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to Driskill Mountain, the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and erosion. The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) spends around $1billion per year to help shore up and protect Louisiana shoreline and land in both federal and state funding.

Besides the waterways named, there are the Sabine, forming the western boundary; and the Pearl, the eastern boundary; the Calcasieu, the Mermentau, the Vermilion, Bayou Teche, the Atchafalaya, the Boeuf, Bayou Lafourche, the Courtableau River, Bayou D&#x27;Arbonne, the Macon River, the Tensas, Amite River, the Tchefuncte, the Tickfaw, the Natalbany River, and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural system of navigable waterways, aggregating over long.

The state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately -wide portion of subsea land of the inner continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Through a peculiarity of the political geography of the United States, this is substantially less than the -wide jurisdiction of nearby states Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have extensive Gulf coastlines.

The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is among the fastest-disappearing areas in the world. This has largely resulted from human mismanagement of the coast (see Wetlands of Louisiana). At one time, the land was added to when spring floods from the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated marsh growth; the land is now shrinking. There are multiple causes.

Artificial levees block spring flood water that would bring fresh water and sediment to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. And as the communities disappear, more and more people are leaving the region. Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry.

The Gulf of Mexico &#x27;dead zone&#x27; off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States. It was in 2017, the largest ever recorded.

===Geology===

The oldest rocks in Louisiana are exposed in the north, in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest. The oldest rocks date back to the early Cenozoic Era, some 60 million years ago. The youngest parts of the state were formed during the last 12,000 years as successive deltas of the Mississippi River: the Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, the modern Mississippi, and now the Atchafalaya. The sediments were carried from north to south by the Mississippi River.

Between the tertiary rocks of the north, and the relatively new sediments along the coast, is a vast belt known as the Pleistocene Terraces. Their age and distribution can be largely related to the rise and fall of sea levels during past ice ages. The northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep channels, while the newer terraces tend to be much flatter.

Salt domes are also found in Louisiana. Their origin can be traced back to the early Gulf of Mexico when the shallow ocean had high rates of evaporation. There are several hundred salt domes in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana. Salt domes are important not only as a source of salt; they also serve as underground traps for oil and gas.

===Flora and fauna===
===Climate===
Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), with long, hot, humid summers and short, mild winters. The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which at its farthest point is no more than away.

Rain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state&#x27;s wet season. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.

Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging or more, and overnight lows averaging above . At times, temperatures in the 90s°F(), combined with dew points in the upper 70s°F(), create sensible temperatures over . The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.

Temperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging . The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging . The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with the average near the Gulf and an average low of in the winter in the northern part of the state.

On occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade. Louisiana&#x27;s highest recorded temperature is in Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is at Minden on February 13, 1899.

Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to strikes by major hurricanes, particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.

The entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida. Louisiana averages 27 tornadoes annually. The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state. Tornadoes are more common from January to March in the southern part of the state, and from February through March in the northern part of the state. Louisiana is partially within the area of tornado activity called Dixie Alley, and the state has tornadoes which tend to be unpredictable but localized.

===Publicly owned land===
Owing to its location and geology, the state has high biological diversity. Some vital areas, such as southwestern prairie, have experienced a loss in excess of 98 percent. The pine flatwoods are also at great risk, mostly from fire suppression and urban sprawl. There is not yet a properly organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana&#x27;s biological diversity. Such a system would consist of a protected system of core areas linked by biological corridors, such as Florida is planning.

Louisiana contains a number of areas which, to varying degrees, prevent people from using them. In addition to National Park Service areas and a United States National Forest, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, one state preservation area, one state forest, and many Wildlife Management Areas.

One of Louisiana&#x27;s largest government-owned areas is Kisatchie National Forest. It is some 600,000 acres in area, more than half of which is flatwoods vegetation, which supports many rare plant and animal species. These include the Louisiana pinesnake and red-cockaded woodpecker. The system of government-owned cypress swamps around Lake Pontchartrain is another large area, with southern wetland species including egrets, alligators, and sturgeon. At least 12 core areas would be needed to build a &quot;protected areas system&quot; for the state; these would range from southwestern prairies, to the Pearl River Floodplain in the east, to the Mississippi River alluvial swamps in the north. Additionally, the state operates a system of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and one state preservation area; in these lands, Louisiana maintains a diversity of fauna and flora.

====National Park Service====
Historic or scenic areas managed, protected, or recognized by the National Park Service include:

* Atchafalaya National Heritage Area in Ascension Parish;
* Cane River National Heritage Area near Natchitoches;
* Cane River Creole National Historical Park near Natchitoches;
* Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, headquartered in New Orleans, with units in St. Bernard Parish, Barataria (Crown Point), and Acadiana (Lafayette);
* Poverty Point National Monument at Delhi, Louisiana; and
* Saline Bayou, a designated National Wild and Scenic River near Winn Parish in northern Louisiana.
====U.S. Forest Service====
* Kisatchie National Forest is Louisiana&#x27;s only national forest. It includes more than 600,000 acres in central and northern Louisiana with large areas of flatwoods and longleaf pine forest.

===Major cities===

Louisiana contains 308 incorporated municipalities, consisting of four consolidated city-parishes, and 304 cities, towns, and villages. Louisiana&#x27;s municipalities cover only 7.9% of the state&#x27;s land mass but are home to 45.3% of its population. The majority of urban Louisianians live along the coast or in northern Louisiana. The oldest permanent settlement in the state is Nachitoches. Baton Rouge, the state capital, is the second-largest city in the state. The most populous city is New Orleans. As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, Louisiana contains 10 metropolitan statistical areas. Major areas include Greater New Orleans, Greater Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Shreveport–Bossier City, and Slidell.
==Demographics==

The majority of the state&#x27;s population lives in southern Louisiana, spread throughout Greater New Orleans, the Florida Parishes, and Acadiana, while Central and North Louisiana have been stagnating and losing population. From the 2020 U.S. census, Louisiana had an apportioned population of 4,661,468. Its resident population was 4,657,757 as of 2020. In 2010, the state of Louisiana had a population of 4,533,372, up from 76,556 in 1810.

Despite historically positive trends of population growth leading up to the 2020 census, Louisiana began to experience population decline and stagnation since 2021, with Southwest Louisiana&#x27;s Calcasieu and Cameron parishes losing more than 5% of their populations individually. Experiencing decline due to deaths and emigration to other states outpacing births and in-migration, Louisiana&#x27;s 2022 census-estimated population was 4,590,241.

According to immigration statistics in 2019, approximately 4.2% of Louisianians were immigrants, while 2% were native-born U.S. citizens with at least one immigrant parent. The majority of Louisianian immigrants came from Honduras (18.8%), Mexico (13.6%), Vietnam (11.3%), Cuba (5.8%), and India (4.4%); an estimated 29.4% were undocumented immigrants. Its documented and undocumented population collectively paid $1.2 billion in taxes. New Orleans has been defined as a sanctuary city.

The population density of the state is 104.9 people per square mile. The center of population of Louisiana is located in Pointe Coupee Parish, in the city of New Roads. According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 7,373 homeless people in Louisiana.

In 2022, Louisiana had the highest percent of births to unmarried women of any US state, at 54.7 percent.

===Race and ethnicity===

Several American Indian tribes such as the Atakapa and Caddo inhabited Louisiana before European colonization, concentrated along the Red River and Gulf of Mexico. At the beginning of French and Spanish colonization of Louisiana, white and black Americans began to move into the area. From French and Spanish rule in Louisiana, they were joined by Filipinos, Germans, and Spaniards both slave and free, who settled in enclaves within the Greater New Orleans region and Acadiana; some of the Spanish-descended communities became the Isleños of St. Bernard Parish.

By the 19th and 20th centuries, the state&#x27;s most-populous racial and ethnic group fluctuated between white and black Americans; 47% of the population was black or African American in 1900. The black Louisianian population declined following migration to states including New York and California in efforts to flee Jim Crow regulations.

At the end of the 20th century, Louisiana&#x27;s population has experienced diversification again, and its non-Hispanic or non-Latino American white population has been declining. Since 2020, the black or African American population have made up the largest non-white share of youths. Hispanic and Latino Americans have also increased as the second-largest racial and ethnic composition in the state, making up nearly 7% of Louisiana&#x27;s population at the 2020 census. As of 2018, the largest single Hispanic and Latino American ethnicity were Mexican Americans (2.0%), followed by Puerto Ricans (0.3%) and Cuban Americans (0.2%). Other Hispanic and Latino Americans altogether made up 2.6% of Louisiana&#x27;s Hispanic or Latino American population. The Asian American and multiracial communities have also experienced rapid growth, with many of Louisiana&#x27;s multiracial population identifying as Cajun or Louisiana Creole.

At the 2019 American Community Survey, the largest ancestry groups of Louisiana were African American (31.4%), French (9.6%), German (6.2%), English (4.6%), Italian (4.2%), and Scottish (0.9%). African American and French heritage have been dominant since colonial Louisiana. As of 2011, 49.0% of Louisiana&#x27;s population younger than age1 were minorities.

===Religion===

As an ethnically and culturally diverse state, pre-colonial, colonial and present-day Louisianians have adhered to a variety of religions and spiritual traditions; pre-colonial and colonial Louisianian peoples practiced various Native American religions alongside Christianity through the establishment of Spanish and French missions; and other faiths including Haitian Vodou and Louisiana Voodoo were introduced to the state and are practiced to the present day. In the colonial and present-day U.S. state of Louisiana, Christianity grew to become its predominant religion, representing 84% of the adult population in 2014 and 76.5% in 2020, during two separate studies by the Pew Research Center and Public Religion Research Institute.

Among its Christian population—and in common with other southern U.S. states—the majority, particularly in the north of the state, belong to various Protestant denominations. Protestantism was introduced to the state in the 1800s, with Baptists establishing two churches in 1812, followed by Methodists; Episcopalians first entered the state by 1805. Protestant Christians made up 57% of the state&#x27;s adult population at the 2014 Pew Research Center study, and 53% at the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute&#x27;s study. Protestants are concentrated in North Louisiana, Central Louisiana, and the northern tier of the Florida Parishes.

Because of French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants the Creoles, and later Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and Greater New Orleans are predominantly Catholic in contrast; according to the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute study, 22% of the adult population were Catholic. Since Creoles were the first settlers, planters and leaders of the territory, they have traditionally been well represented in politics; for instance, most of the early governors were Creole Catholics, instead of Protestants. As Catholics continue to constitute a significant fraction of Louisiana&#x27;s population, they have continued to be influential in state politics. The high proportion and influence of the Catholic population makes Louisiana distinct among southern states. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans, Diocese of Baton Rouge, and Diocese of Lafayette in Louisiana are the largest Catholic jurisdictions in the state, located within the Greater New Orleans, Greater Baton Rouge, and Lafayette metropolitan statistical areas.

Louisiana was among the southern states with a significant Jewish population before the 20th century; Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia also had influential Jewish populations in some of their major cities from the 18th and 19th centuries. The earliest Jewish colonists were Sephardic Jews who immigrated to the Thirteen Colonies. Later in the 19th century, German Jews began to immigrate, followed by those from eastern Europe and the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Jewish communities have been established in the state&#x27;s larger cities, notably New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The most significant of these is the Jewish community of the New Orleans area. In 2000, before the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, its population was about 12,000. Dominant Jewish movements in the state include Orthodox and Reform Judaism; Reform Judaism was the largest Jewish tradition in the state according to the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020, representing some 5,891 Jews.
Prominent Jews in Louisiana&#x27;s political leadership have included Whig (later Democrat) Judah P. Benjamin, who represented Louisiana in the U.S. Senate before the American Civil War and then became the Confederate secretary of state; Democrat-turned-Republican Michael Hahn who was elected as governor, serving 1864–1865 when Louisiana was occupied by the Union Army, and later elected in 1884 as a U.S. congressman; Democrat Adolph Meyer, Confederate Army officer who represented the state in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1891 until his death in 1908; Republican secretary of state Jay Dardenne, and Republican (Democrat before 2011) attorney general Buddy Caldwell.

Other non-Christian and non-Jewish religions with a continuous, historical presence in the state have been Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. In the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan area, Muslims made up an estimated 14% of Louisiana&#x27;s total Muslim population as of 2014. In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were 24,732 Muslims living in the state. The largest Islamic denominations in the major metropolises of Louisiana were Sunni Islam, non-denominational Islam and Quranism, Shia Islam, and the Nation of Islam.

Among Louisiana&#x27;s irreligious community, 2% affiliated with atheism and 13% claimed no religion as of 2014; an estimated 10% of the state&#x27;s population practiced nothing in particular at the 2014 study. According to the Public Religion Research Institute in 2020, 19% were religiously unaffiliated.

==Economy==
Louisiana&#x27;s population, agricultural products, abundance of oil and natural gas, and southern Louisiana&#x27;s medical and technology corridors have contributed to its growing and diversifying economy. In 2014, Louisiana was ranked as one of the most small business friendly states, based on a study drawing upon data from more than 12,000 small business owners. The state&#x27;s principal agricultural products include seafood (it is the biggest producer of crawfish in the world, supplying approximately 90%), cotton, soybeans, cattle, sugarcane, poultry and eggs, dairy products, and rice. Among its energy and other industries, chemical products, petroleum and coal products, processed foods, transportation equipment, and paper products have contributed to a significant portion of the state&#x27;s GSP. Tourism and gaming are also important elements in the economy, especially in Greater New Orleans.

The Port of South Louisiana, located on the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, was the largest volume shipping port in the Western Hemisphere and 4th largest in the world, as well as the largest bulk cargo port in the U.S. in 2004. The Port of South Louisiana continued to be the busiest port by tonnage in the U.S. through 2018. South Louisiana was number 15 among world ports in 2016.

New Orleans, Shreveport, and Baton Rouge are home to a thriving film industry. State financial incentives since 2002 and aggressive promotion have given Louisiana the nickname &quot;Hollywood South&quot;. Because of its distinctive culture within the United States, only Alaska is Louisiana&#x27;s rival in popularity as a setting for reality television programs. In late 2007 and early 2008, a film studio was scheduled to open in Tremé, with state-of-the-art production facilities, and a film training institute. Tabasco sauce, which is marketed by one of the United States&#x27; biggest producers of hot sauce, the McIlhenny Company, originated on Avery Island.

From 2010 to 2020, Louisiana&#x27;s gross state product increased from $213.6billion to $253.3billion, the 26th highest in the United States at the time. As of 2020, its GSP is greater than the GDPs of Greece, Peru, and New Zealand. Ranking 41st in the United States with a per capita personal income of $30,952 in 2014, its residents per capita income decreased to $28,662 in 2019. The median household income was $51,073, while the national average was $65,712 at the 2019 American Community Survey. In July 2017, the state&#x27;s unemployment rate was 5.3%; it decreased to 4.4% in 2019.

Louisiana has three personal income tax brackets, ranging from 2% to 6%. The state sales tax rate is 4.45%, and parishes can levy additional sales tax on top of this. The state also has a use tax, which includes 4% to be distributed to local governments. Property taxes are assessed and collected at the local level. Louisiana is a subsidized state, and Louisiana taxpayers receive more federal funding per dollar of federal taxes paid compared to the average state. Per dollar of federal tax collected in 2005, Louisiana citizens received approximately $1.78 in the way of federal spending. This ranks the state fourth highest nationally and represents a rise from 1995 when Louisiana received $1.35 per dollar of taxes in federal spending (ranked seventh nationally). Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02). Federal spending in 2005 and subsequent years since has been exceptionally high due to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina.

==Culture==

Louisiana is home to many cultures; especially notable are the distinct cultures of the Louisiana Creoles and Cajuns, descendants of French and Spanish settlers in colonial Louisiana.

===African culture===
The French colony of &quot;La Louisiane&quot; struggled for decades to survive. Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.

At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of White and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them. This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in Saint-Domingue were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.

===Creole culture===

Creole culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures. Creole comes from the Portuguese word &quot;crioulo&quot;; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France. The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word &quot;Creole&quot;, from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony. But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.

Over time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of Creoles of Color (&quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans). Often the French would free their concubines and mixed-race children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term &quot;Creole&quot; became associated with this class of Creoles of color, many of whom achieved freedom long before the American Civil War.

Wealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in New Orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.

===Acadian culture===
The ancestors of Cajuns immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, known originally as the French colony of Acadia. After the British defeated France in the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. After the Acadians refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the British Crown, they were expelled from Acadia, and made their way to places such as France, Britain, and New England.

Other Acadians covertly remained in British North America or moved to New Spain. Many Acadians settled in southern Louisiana in the region around Lafayette and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture.

===Isleño culture===
A third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isleños. Its members are descendants of colonists from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as Frenchmen, Acadians, Creoles, Spaniards, and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.

In Louisiana, the Isleños originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. The transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.

Through the centuries, the various Isleño communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana. The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated annually in St. Bernard Parish which features heritage performances from local groups and the Canary Islands.

==Education==

Despite ranking as the third-least educated state as of 2023, preceded by Mississippi and West Virginia, Louisiana is home to over 40 public and private colleges and universities including: Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge; Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in Lafayette; and Tulane University in New Orleans. Louisiana State University is the largest and most comprehensive university in Louisiana; Louisiana Tech University is one the most well regarded universities in Louisiana; the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is the second largest by enrollment. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette became an R1 university in December 2021. Tulane University is a major private research university and the wealthiest university in Louisiana with an endowment over $1.1billion. Tulane is also highly regarded for its academics nationwide, consistently ranked in the top 50 on &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; list of best national universities.

Louisiana&#x27;s two oldest and largest historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are Southern University in Baton Rouge and Grambling State University in Grambling. Both these Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) schools compete against each other in football annually in the much anticipated Bayou Classic during Thanksgiving weekend in the Superdome.

Of note among the education system, the Louisiana Science Education Act was a controversial law passed by the Louisiana Legislature on June 11, 2008, and signed into law by Governor Bobby Jindal on June 25. The act allowed public school teachers to use supplemental materials in the science classroom which are critical of established science on such topics as the theory of evolution and global warming.

In 2000, of all of the states, Louisiana had the highest percentage of students in private schools. Danielle Dreilinger of &quot;The Times Picayune&quot; wrote in 2014 that &quot;Louisiana parents have a national reputation for favoring private schools.&quot; The number of students in enrolled in private schools in Louisiana declined by 9% from until 2014, due to the proliferation of charter schools, the 2008 recession and Hurricane Katrina. Ten parishes in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans area had a combined 17% decline in private school enrollment in that period. This prompted private schools to lobby for school vouchers.

Louisiana&#x27;s school voucher program is known as the Louisiana Scholarship Program. It was available in the New Orleans area beginning in 2008 and in the rest of the state beginning in 2012. In 2013, the number of students using school vouchers to attend private schools was 6,751, and for 2014 it was projected to exceed 8,800. As per a ruling from Ivan Lemelle, a U.S. district judge, the federal government has the right to review the charter school placements to ensure they do not further racial segregation.

==Transportation==
The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development is the state government organization in charge of maintaining public transportation, roadways, bridges, canals, select levees, floodplain management, port facilities, commercial vehicles, and aviation which includes 69 airports.

===Roads===


====Interstate highways====

====United States highways====

In 2022, Louisiana ranked 5th highest for fatal crashes in the US with a rate of 19.7 deaths per 100,000 population.

===Rail===

Six Class I freight railroads operate in Louisiana: BNSF, Canadian National, CPKC, CSX, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific. A number of Class II and Class III railroads also carry freight.

Amtrak, the national passenger railroad, operates three long-distance rail routes through Louisiana. All three originate at New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal. The &quot;Crescent&quot; serves then runs northeast to via , , , and The &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; stops at before continuing north to by way of and . The &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; serves , , , and on its route west to via , , , and . Before Hurricane Katrina, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; ran as far east as .

===Mass transit===

Predominantly serving New Orleans, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority is the largest transit agency in the state. Other transit organizations are St. Bernard Urban Rapid Transit, Jefferson Transit, Capital Area Transit System, Lafayette Transit System, Shreveport Area Transit System, and Monroe Transit, among others.

The Louisiana Transportation Authority (under the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development) was created in 2001 to &quot;promote, plan, finance, develop, construct, control, regulate, operate and maintain any tollway or transitway to be constructed within its jurisdiction. Development, construction, improvement, expansion, and maintenance of an efficient, safe, and well-maintained intermodal transportation system is essential to promote Louisiana&#x27;s economic growth and the ability of Louisiana&#x27;s business and industry to compete in regional, national, and global markets and to provide a high quality of life for the people of Louisiana.&quot;

===Air===

Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (MSY) is the busiest airport in Louisiana by an order of magnitude. It is also the second lowest-lying international airport in the world, at just above sea level. There are six other primary airports in the state: Baton Rouge Metropolitan, Shreveport Regional, Lafayette Regional, Alexandria International, Monroe Regional, and Lake Charles Regional. A total of 69 public-use airports exist in Louisiana.

===Waterways===
The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway is an important means of transporting commercial goods such as petroleum and petroleum products, agricultural produce, building materials and manufactured goods. In 2018, the state sued the federal government to repair erosion along the waterway.

==Law and government==
:

In 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. Donaldsonville, Opelousas, and Shreveport have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The Louisiana State Capitol and the Louisiana Governor&#x27;s Mansion are both located in Baton Rouge. The Louisiana Supreme Court, however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.

Louisiana is widely considered a Republican Party stronghold and its incumbent governor is Republican Jeff Landry. The current United States senators are Republicans John Neely Kennedy and Bill Cassidy. Louisiana has six congressional districts and is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by four Republicans and two Democrats. Louisiana had eight votes in the Electoral College for the 2020 election.

In a 2020 study, Louisiana was ranked as the 24th hardest state for citizens to vote in. Louisiana has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the United States.

The Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola is the largest maximum-security prison in the United States.

===Administrative divisions===
Louisiana is divided into 64 parishes (the equivalent of counties in most other states).
*List of parishes in Louisiana
*Louisiana census statistical areas

Most parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.

A more limited number of parishes operate under home rule charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor–council, council–manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.

===Civil law===
The Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term &quot;parish&quot; (from the French: ) in place of &quot;county&quot; for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of civil law based on French, German, and Spanish legal codes and ultimately Roman law, as opposed to English common law.

Louisiana&#x27;s civil law system is what the majority of sovereign states in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive their legal systems from the British Empire. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the Napoleonic Code. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had purchased and annexed Louisiana in 1803.

The Louisiana Civil Code is the controlling authority on civil matters in the state and has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment in 1808. While some of the differences between the legal systems have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition, the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law. Thus property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law, as well as some aspects of criminal law, are based mostly on traditional Roman legal thinking.

===Marriage===
In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a covenant marriage. In a covenant marriage, the couple waives their right to a &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce after six months of separation, which is available in a traditional marriage. To divorce under a covenant marriage, a couple must demonstrate cause. Marriages between ascendants and descendants, and marriages between collaterals within the fourth degree (i.e., siblings, aunt and nephew, uncle and niece, first cousins) are prohibited. Same-sex marriages were prohibited by statute, but the U.S. Supreme Court declared such bans unconstitutional in 2015 in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;. Same-sex marriages are now performed statewide. Louisiana is a community property state.

===Elections===

















From 1898 to 1965, a period when Louisiana had effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites by provisions of a new constitution, this was essentially a one-party state dominated by white Democrats. Elites had control in the early 20th century, before populist Huey Long came to power as governor. In multiple acts of resistance, blacks left behind the segregation, violence and oppression of the state and moved out to seek better opportunities in northern and western industrial cities during the Great Migrations of 1910–1970, markedly reducing their proportion of population in Louisiana. The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Since the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President Lyndon Johnson to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, David Vitter was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator. The previous Republican senator, John S. Harris, who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.

Louisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a nonpartisan blanket primary (or &quot;jungle primary&quot;) on Election Day. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.

Congressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except Washington, California, and Maine) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a plurality voting system or runoff voting, to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal congressional elections were run under a closed primary system—limited to registered party members. However, on the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.

Louisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. Though the state historically flips between Republican and Democratic governors, Louisiana is not classified as a swing state in presidential elections, as it has consistently voted for the Republican candidate by solid margins since backing Democrat Bill Clinton in 1996. The state&#x27;s two U.S. senators are Bill Cassidy (R) and John Neely Kennedy (R).

===Law enforcement===

Louisiana&#x27;s statewide police force is the Louisiana State Police. In 1988, the Criminal Investigation Bureau was reorganized. Its troopers have statewide jurisdiction with power to enforce all laws of the state, including city and parish ordinances. Each year, they patrol over of roadway and arrest about 10,000 impaired drivers. The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.
The elected sheriff in each parish is its chief law enforcement officer. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes, with the exception of Orleans Parish where this falls to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans Parish was the only parish to have two sheriff&#x27;s offices, with a different elected sheriff overseeing civil and criminal matters. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff&#x27;s departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both.

In 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year. Louisiana is the only state with an annual average murder rate (13.6 per 100,000) at least twice as high as the U.S. annual average (6.6 per 100,000) during that period, according to Bureau of Justice Statistics from FBI Uniform Crime Reports. In a different kind of criminal activity, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reports that Louisiana is the most corrupt state in the United States.

According to a 2012 article in &quot;The Times Picayune&quot;, Louisiana is the prison capital of the world. Many for-profit private prisons and sheriff-owned prisons have been built and operate here. Louisiana&#x27;s incarceration rate is nearly five times Iran&#x27;s, 13 times China&#x27;s and 20 times Germany&#x27;s. Minorities are incarcerated at rates disproportionate to their share of the state&#x27;s population. There are more people serving life sentences without parole in Louisiana than in Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi combined.

The New Orleans Police Department began a sanctuary policy to &quot;no longer cooperate with federal immigration enforcement&quot; beginning on February 28, 2016.

On June 19, 2024, Jeff Landry signed a bill to officially require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom in public schools and colleges, making it the only state to have that law.

===Judiciary===
The judiciary of Louisiana is defined under the constitution and law of Louisiana and comprises the Louisiana Supreme Court, the Louisiana Circuit Courts of Appeal, the district courts, the Justice of the Peace courts, the mayor&#x27;s courts, the city courts, and the parish courts. The chief justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court is the chief administrator of the judiciary. Its administration is aided by the Judiciary Commission of Louisiana, the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board, and the Judicial Council of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.

==National Guard==
Louisiana has more than 9,000 soldiers in the Louisiana Army National Guard, including the 225th Engineer Brigade and the 256th Infantry Brigade. Both these units have served overseas during the War on Terror. The Louisiana Air National Guard has more than 2,000 airmen, and its 159th Fighter Wing has likewise seen combat.

Training sites in the state include Louisiana National Guard Training Center Pineville near Pineville, Camp Villere near Slidell, Camp Minden near Minden, England Air Park (formerly England Air Force Base) near Alexandria, Gillis Long Center near Carville, and Jackson Barracks in New Orleans.

==Sports==

Louisiana is the least populous state with more than one major professional sports league franchise: the National Basketball Association&#x27;s New Orleans Pelicans and the National Football League&#x27;s New Orleans Saints.

Louisiana has 12 collegiate NCAA Division I programs, a high number given its population. The state has no NCAA Division II teams and only two NCAA Division III teams. As of 2019, the LSU Tigers football team has won 12 Southeastern Conference titles, six Sugar Bowls and four national championships.

Each year New Orleans plays host to the Bayou Classic, and the New Orleans Bowl college football games, while Shreveport hosts the Independence Bowl. New Orleans has hosted the Super Bowl a record eleven times, as well as the BCS National Championship Game, NBA All-Star Game and NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship.

The Zurich Classic of New Orleans, is a PGA Tour golf tournament held since 1938. The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Mardi Gras Marathon and Crescent City Classic are two road running competitions held at New Orleans.

As of 2016, Louisiana was the birthplace of the most NFL players per capita for the eighth year in a row.

REV.&quot; 4 (1971); Rodolfo Batiza, &quot;Sources of the Civil Code of 1808, Facts and Speculation: A Rejoinder&quot;, 46 &quot;TUL. L. REV.&quot; 628 (1972); Robert A.

* The standard history of the state, though only through the Civil War, is Charles Gayarré&#x27;s &quot;History of Louisiana&quot; (various editions, culminating in 1866, 4 vols., with a posthumous and further expanded edition in 1885).
* A number of accounts by 17th- and 18th-century French explorers: Jean-Bernard Bossu, François-Marie Perrin du Lac, Pierre-François-Xavier de Charlevoix, Dumont (as published by Fr. Mascrier), Fr. Louis Hennepin, Lahontan, Louis Narcisse Baudry des Lozières, Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe, and Laval. In this group, the explorer Antoine Simon Le Page du Pratz may be the first historian of Louisiana with his &quot;Histoire de la Louisiane&quot; (3 vols., Paris, 1758; 2 vols., London, 1763)
* François Xavier Martin&#x27;s &quot;History of Louisiana&quot; (2 vols., New Orleans, 1827–1829, later ed. by J. F. Condon, continued to 1861, New Orleans, 1882) is the first scholarly treatment of the subject, along with François Barbé-Marbois&#x27; &quot;Histoire de la Louisiane et de la cession de colonie par la France aux Etats-Unis&quot; (Paris, 1829; in English, Philadelphia, 1830).
* Alcée Fortier&#x27;s &quot;A History of Louisiana&quot; (N.Y., 4 vols., 1904) is the most recent of the large-scale scholarly histories of the state.
* The official works of Albert Phelps and Grace King, the publications of the Louisiana Historical Society and several works on the history of New Orleans (q.v.), among them those by Henry Rightor and John Smith Kendall provide background.

<text>Los Angeles International Airport is the primary international airport serving Los Angeles and its surrounding metropolitan area, in the U.S. state of California. LAX is located in the Westchester neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles, southwest of downtown Los Angeles, with the commercial and residential areas of Westchester to the north, the city of El Segundo to the south, and the city of Inglewood to the east. LAX is the closest airport to the Westside and the South Bay.

The airport is operated by Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), a branch of the Los Angeles city government, that also operates the Van Nuys Airport for general aviation. The airport covers of land and has four parallel runways.

In 2023, LAX handled 75,050,875 passengers, making it the world&#x27;s eighth-busiest airport, according to the Airports Council International rankings. In 2024, LAX served 76,587,980 passengers, a 2.04% increase from 2023. As the largest and busiest international airport on the West Coast of the United States, LAX is a major international gateway for the country, serving as a connection point for passengers traveling internationally (such as East and Southeast Asia, Australasia, Mexico, and Central America).

The airport holds the record for the world&#x27;s busiest origin and destination airport, because relative to other airports, many more travelers begin or end their trips in Los Angeles than use it as a connection. In 2019, LAWA reported approximately 88 percent of travelers at LAX were origination and destination passengers, and 12 percent were connecting. It is also the only airport to rank among the top five U.S. airports for both passenger and cargo traffic. LAX serves as a hub, focus city, or operating base for more passenger airlines than any other airport in the United States.

Although LAX is the busiest airport in the Greater Los Angeles area, several other airports serve the region including Burbank, John Wayne (Orange County), Long Beach, Ontario, and San Bernardino.

==History==


In 1926, the Los Angeles City Council and the Chamber of Commerce recognized the need for the city to have its own airport to tap into the fledgling, but quickly growing, aviation industry. Several locations were considered, but the final choice was a field in the southern part of Westchester. The location had been promoted by real estate agent William W. Mines, and Mines Field as it was known had already been selected to host the 1928 National Air Races. On August 13, 1928 the city leased the land and the newly formed Department of Airports began converting the fields, once used to grow wheat, barley, and lima beans, into dirt landing strips.

The airport opened on October 1, 1928 and the first structure, Hangar No. 1, was erected in 1929. The building still stands at the airport, remaining in active use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Over the next year, the airport started to come together: the dirt runway was replaced with an all-weather surface and more hangars, a restaurant, and a control tower were built. On June 7, 1930, the facility was dedicated and renamed Los Angeles Municipal Airport.

The airport was used by private pilots and flying schools, but the city’s vision was that Los Angeles would become the main passenger hub for the area. However, the airport failed to entice any carriers away from the established Burbank Airport or the Grand Central Airport in Glendale.

World War II put a pause on any further development of the airport for passenger use. Before the United States entered the war, the aviation manufacturers located around the airport were busy providing aircraft for the Allied powers, while the flying schools found themselves in high demand. In January 1942, the military assumed control of the airport, stationing fighter planes there, and building naval gun batteries in the ocean dunes to the west.

Meanwhile, airport managers published a master plan for the land and, in early 1943, convinced voters to back a $12.5 million bond for airport improvements. With a plan and funding in place, the airlines were finally convinced to make the move.

After the end of the War, four temporary terminals were quickly erected on the north side of the airport and, on December 9, 1946, American Airlines, Trans World Airlines (TWA), United Airlines, Southwest Airways, and Western Airlines began passenger operations at the airport, with Pan American Airways (Pan Am) joining the next month. The airport was renamed Los Angeles International Airport in 1949.

The temporary terminals remained in place for 15 years but quickly became inadequate, especially as air travel entered the &quot;jet age&quot; and other cities invested in modern facilities. Airport leaders once again convinced voters to back a $59 million bond on June 5, 1956.

The current layout of the passenger facilities was established in 1958 with a plan to build a series of terminals and parking facilities, arranged in the shape of the letter U, in the central portion of the property. The original plan called for the terminal buildings to be connected at the center of the property by a huge steel-and-glass dome. The dome was never built, but a smaller Theme Building, constructed in the central area, became a focal point for people coming to the airport.

The first of the new passenger buildings, Terminals 7 and 8, were opened for United Airlines on June 25, 1961, following opening festivities that lasted several days. Terminals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 opened later that same year.

There was a major expansion of the airport in the early 1980s, ahead of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games. In November 1983, a second-level roadway was added, Terminal 1 opened in January 1984 and the Tom Bradley International Terminal opened in June 1984. The original terminals also received expansions and updates in the 1980s.

Since 2008, the airport has been undergoing another major expansion. All of the terminals are being refurbished, and the Tom Bradley International Terminal was substantially rebuilt, with a West Gates satellite concourse added. Outside of the terminal area, the LAX West Intermodal Transportation Facility with 4,300 parking spaces opened in 2021, replacing the former Lot C. A new LAX/Metro Transit Center station and a LAX Consolidated Rent-A-Car Facility (ConRAC) are being built. All will be connected to the terminal area by the LAX Automated People Mover. Altogether, those projects are expected to cost $30 billion and bring LAX&#x27;s total gates from 146 to 182.

===The &quot;X&quot; in LAX===
Before the 1930s, US airports used a two-letter abbreviation and &quot;LA&quot; served as the designation for Los Angeles Airport. With rapid growth in the aviation industry, in 1947, the identifiers were expanded to three letters, and &quot;LA&quot; received an extra letter to become &quot;LAX&quot;. The &quot;X&quot; does not have any specific meaning. &quot;LAX&quot; is also used for the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro and by Amtrak for Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles.

==Infrastructure==
=== Airfield ===
Runways 24R/06L and 24L/06R (designated the North Airfield Complex) are north of the airport terminals, while runways 25R/07L and 25L/07R (designated the South Airfield Complex) are south of the airport terminals.

LAX is located with the Pacific Ocean to the west and residential communities on all other sides. Since 1972, Los Angeles World Airports has adopted a &quot;Preferential Runway Use Policy&quot; to minimize noise levels in the communities closest to LAX.

Typically, the loudest operations at an airport are from departing aircraft, with engines operating at high power, so during daytime hours (6:30am to midnight), LAX prefers to operate under the &quot;Westerly Operations&quot; air traffic pattern, named for the prevailing west winds. Under &quot;Westerly Operations&quot;, departing aircraft take off to the west, over the ocean, and arriving aircraft approach from the east. To reduce noise to areas north and south of the airport, LAX prefers to use the &quot;inboard&quot; runways (06R/24L and 07L/25R) for departures, closest to the central terminal area and further from residential areas, and the &quot;outboard&quot; runways for arrivals. Historically, over 90% of flights have used the &quot;inboard&quot; departures and &quot;outboard&quot; arrivals scheme.

During night-time hours, when there are fewer aircraft operations and residential areas tend to be more noise sensitive, additional changes are made to reduce noise. Between 10pm and 7am, air traffic controllers try to use the &quot;outboard&quot; runways as little as possible and, between midnight and 6:30am, the air traffic pattern shifts to &quot;Over-Ocean Operations&quot;, under which departing aircraft continue to take off to the west, but arriving aircraft also approach from the west, over the ocean.

There are times when the Over-Ocean and Westerly operations are not possible, particularly when the winds originate from the east, typically during inclement weather and when Santa Ana winds occur. In those cases, the airport shifts to the non-preferred &quot;Easterly Operations&quot; air traffic pattern, under which departing aircraft take off to the east, and arriving aircraft approach from the west.

The South Airfield Complex tends to see more operations than the North, because there are a larger number of passenger gates and air cargo operations areas on the south side of the airport grounds. In 2007, the southernmost runway (07R/25L) was moved to the south to accommodate a new central taxiway. Runways in the North Airfield Complex are separated by . There were plans to increase the separation by , which would have allowed a central taxiway between runways to have been built, but faced opposition from residents living north of LAX. These plans were scrapped in 2016, in favor of lifting a gate cap at the airport and building a new park on the airport&#x27;s north side.

=== Terminals ===
===Theme Building===

The distinctive Theme Building in the Googie style was built in 1961 and resembles a flying saucer that has landed on its four legs. A restaurant with a sweeping view of the airport is suspended beneath two arches that form the legs. The Los Angeles City Council designated the building a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1992. A $4 million renovation, with retro-futuristic interior and electric lighting designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, was completed before the Encounter Restaurant opened there in 1997 but is no longer in business. Visitors are able to take the elevator up to the observation deck of the &quot;Theme Building&quot;, which had previously been closed after the September 11, 2001 attacks for security reasons. A memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks is located on the grounds, as three of the four hijacked planes were originally destined for LAX. The Bob Hope USO expanded and relocated to the first floor of the Theme Building in 2018.

===Recent and future developments===
LAWA currently has several plans to modernize LAX, at a cost of $30 billion. These include terminal and runway improvements, which will &quot;enhance the passenger experience, reduce overcrowding, and provide airport access to the latest class of very large passenger aircraft&quot;; this will bring the number of LAX&#x27;s total gates from 146 to 182.

Recently completed improvements include:
* Renovations of Terminal 1 (completed 2018), Terminals 7 and 8 (completed 2019), and Terminals 2 and 3 (completed 2023)
* Terminal 1.5, a junction building connecting Terminals 1 and 2, with a bus gate to take passengers to boarding gates in the Tom Bradley International Terminal (completed 2021)
* The Midfield Satellite Concourse (West Gates at Tom Bradley International Terminal) adding 15 gates (completed 2021)
* Economy Parking facility, a 4,300-stall parking structure with passenger pick-up/drop-off areas, to later be connected to the terminal area by the APM (completed 2021)
* Replacement Los Angeles Airport Police headquarters (completed 2021)
* Terminal 4.5, a building connecting Terminals 4 and 5 to the LAX Automated People Mover and providing new landside space (completed 2022)
* LAX Consolidated Rent-A-Car Facility, connected to the terminal area by the LAX Automated People Mover (completed 2024)

Future improvements include:
* Renovation of Terminals 4 and 5 (under construction, scheduled completion 2028)
* Renovation of Terminal 6 (under construction, scheduled completion 2025)
* Expansion of the Midfield Satellite Concourse adding 8 gates (under construction, scheduled completion 2025)
* LAX Automated People Mover (APM) (under construction, scheduled completion 2026)
* LAX/Metro Transit Center station, a Los Angeles Metro Rail and bus station, connected to the terminal area by the APM (under construction, scheduled completion 2025)
* Construction of new Terminals 0 and 9 (in planning)
* Extension of Taxiway D (in planning)
* Roadway improvements, providing improved access to the above facilities and the Central Terminal Area (in planning)

===Transiting between terminals===
In the secure area of the airport, tunnels or above-ground connectors link all the terminals except for the regional terminal.

LAX Shuttle route A operates in a counter-clockwise loop around the Central Terminal Area, providing frequent service for connecting passengers. However, connecting passengers who use these shuttles must leave and then later re-enter security.

===LAX Shuttle routes===
LAX operates several shuttle routes to connect passengers and employees around the airport area:

Route A – Terminal Connector operates in a counter-clockwise loop around the Central Terminal Area, providing frequent service for connecting passengers. However, connecting passengers who use these shuttles must leave and then later re-enter security.

Route C – City Bus Center connects the Central Terminal Area and the LAX City Bus Center which is served by transit buses from Beach Cities Transit, Culver CityBus, Los Angeles Metro, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus and Torrance Transit. Buses on this route also serve the Employee South Lot.

Route E – Economy Parking connects the Central Terminal Area and the West Intermodal Transportation Facility, the airport&#x27;s economy parking garage.

Route M – Metro Connector connects the Central Terminal Area with the Aviation/LAX station on the Metro C Line and the Aviation/Century station on the C Line and K Line. Buses also stop at the &quot;Remote Rental Car Depot&quot;, a bus stop served by shuttles to smaller rental car companies.

Route X – LAX Employee Lots connects the Central Terminal Area and the Employee Parking Lots. The route has three service patterns: the East Lot route only stops at Terminals 1, 2, 3, and B; the West Lot route only stops at Terminals 4, 5, 6, and 7; and the South Lot route stops at all terminals and also stops at the City Bus Center as Route C.

=== Transit buses ===

Most transit buses operate from the LAX City Bus Center, which is located away from the Central Terminal Area on 96th Street, east of Sepulveda Boulevard.

LAX Shuttle route C offers free connections between the LAX City Bus Center and the Central Terminal Area.

The LAX City Bus Center is served by Beach Cities Transit line 109 to Redondo Beach, Culver CityBus lines 6 and Rapid 6 to Culver City and UCLA, Los Angeles Metro Bus lines to South Gate, to Norwalk, to Downey and to Long Beach, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus lines 3 and Rapid 3 to Santa Monica, and Torrance Transit line 8 to Torrance. During the overnight hours, Los Angeles Metro line offers service to Downtown Los Angeles.

The LAX City Bus Center will eventually be replaced by the LAX/Metro Transit Center station, which will be connected to the rest of LAX by the Automated People Mover system.

There is also a bus stop at Sepulveda Boulevard and Century Boulevard that is a walk away from Terminals 1 and 7/8 that is served by LADOT Commuter Express line to Sylmar and Encino. This bus stop is also served by some of the same routes as the LAX City Bus Center: Los Angeles Metro lines 40 (overnight only), 117 and 232 and Torrance Transit line 8.

===FlyAway Bus===


The FlyAway bus is a nonstop motorcoach/shuttle service run by LAWA, which provides scheduled service between LAX and Union Station in Downtown LA or the FlyAway terminal at the Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley.

FlyAway buses stop at every LAX terminal in a counter-clockwise direction, starting at terminal 1. The service hours vary based on the line, with most leaving on or near the top of the hour. Buses use the regional system of high-occupancy vehicle lanes and high-occupancy toll lanes (Metro ExpressLanes) to expedite their trips.

===Metro Rail and the LAX Automated People Mover===

LAX does not currently have a direct connection to the Los Angeles Metro Rail system. LAX Shuttle route G offers free connections between the Central Terminal Area and the Aviation/LAX station on the C Line, away.

The LAX Automated People Mover (APM), currently under construction by LAWA, is a rail line that will connect the terminal area with long- and short-term parking facilities, a connection to the Los Angeles Metro Rail and other transit at the LAX/Metro Transit Center, and a consolidated facility for all airport rental car agencies.

The APM project is estimated to cost $5.5 billion and is scheduled to begin operation in 2025, with the connection to Metro Rail opening thereafter.

===Freeways and roads===
LAX&#x27;s terminals are immediately west of the interchange between Century Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard (State Route 1). Interstate 405 can be reached to the east via Century Boulevard. Interstate 105 is to the south via Sepulveda Boulevard, through the Airport Tunnel that crosses under the airport runways.

=== Taxis, ride-share and private shuttles ===
Arriving passengers take a shuttle or walk to the LAXit waiting area east of Terminal 1 for taxi or ride-share pickups. Taxi services are operated by nine city-authorized taxi companies and regulated by Authorized Taxicab Supervision Inc. (ATS). ATS queues up taxis at the LAXit waiting area.

A number of private shuttle companies also offer limousine and bus services to LAX.

==Other facilities==
The airport has the administrative offices of Los Angeles World Airports.

Continental Airlines once had its corporate headquarters on the airport property. At a 1962 press conference in the office of Mayor of Los Angeles Sam Yorty, Continental Airlines announced that it planned to move its headquarters to Los Angeles in July 1963. In 1963 Continental Airlines headquarters moved to a two-story, $2.3 million building on the grounds of the airport. The July 2009 &quot;Continental Magazine&quot; issue stated that the move &quot;underlined Continental Airlines western and Pacific orientation&quot;. On July 1, 1983 the airline&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to the America Tower in the Neartown area of Houston.

In addition to Continental Airlines, Western Airlines and Flying Tiger Line also had their headquarters at LAX.

===Flight Path Museum LAX===
The Flight Path Museum LAX, formerly known as the Flight Path Learning Center, is a museum located at 6661 Imperial Highway and was formerly known as the &quot;West Imperial Terminal&quot;. This building used to house some charter flights. It sat empty for 10 years until it was re-opened as a learning center for LAX.

The center contains information on the history of aviation, several pictures of the airport, as well as aircraft scale models, flight attendant uniforms, and general airline memorabilia such as playing cards, china, magazines, signs, and a TWA gate information sign.

The museum&#x27;s library contains an extensive collection of rare items such as aircraft manufacturer company newsletters/magazines, technical manuals for both military and civilian aircraft, industry magazines dating back to World War II and before, historic photographs and other invaluable references on aircraft operation and manufacturing.

The museum has on display &quot;The Spirit of Seventy-Six,&quot; a DC-3 that flew in commercial airline service, before serving as a corporate aircraft for Union 76 Oil Company for 32 years. The plane was built in the Douglas Aircraft Company plant in Santa Monica in January 1941, which was a major producer of both commercial and military aircraft.
==Accidents and incidents==
During its history there have been numerous incidents, but only the most notable are summarized below:

===1930s===
* On January 23, 1939, the sole prototype Douglas 7B twin-engine attack bomber, designed and built as a company project, suffered a loss of the vertical fin and rudder during a demonstration flight over Mines Field, flat spun into the parking lot of North American Aviation, and burned. Another source states that the test pilot, in an attempt to impress the Gallic passenger, attempted a snap roll at low altitude with one engine feathered, resulting in a fatal spin. Douglas test pilot Johnny Cable bailed out at 300 feet, his chute unfurled but did not have time to deploy, he was killed on impact, the flight engineer John Parks rode in the airframe and died, but 33-year-old French Air Force Capt. Paul Chemidlin, riding in the aft fuselage near the top turret, survived with a broken leg, severe back injuries, and a slight concussion. The presence of Chemidlin, a representative of a foreign purchasing mission, caused a furor in Congress by isolationists over neutrality and export laws. The type was developed as the Douglas DB-7.

===1940s===
* On June 1, 1940, the first Douglas R3D-1 for the U.S. Navy, BuNo &quot;1901&quot;, crashed at Mines Field, before delivery. The Navy later acquired the privately owned DC-5 prototype, from William E. Boeing as a replacement.
* On November 20, 1940, the prototype NA-73X Mustang, &quot;NX19998&quot;, first flown October 26, 1940, by test pilot Vance Breese, crashed. According to P-51 designer Edgar Schmued, the NA-73 was lost because test pilot Paul Balfour refused, before a high-speed test run, to go through the takeoff and flight test procedure with Schmued while the aircraft was on the ground, claiming &quot;one airplane was like another&quot;. After making two high speed passes over Mines Field, he forgot to put the fuel valve on &quot;reserve&quot; and during the third pass ran out of fuel. An emergency landing in a freshly plowed field caused the wheels to dig in, the aircraft flipped over, the airframe was not rebuilt, the second aircraft being used for subsequent testing.
* On October 26, 1944, WASP pilot Gertrude Tompkins Silver of the 601st Ferrying Squadron, fifth Ferrying Group, Love Field, Dallas, Texas, departed Los Angeles Airport, in a North American P-51D Mustang, &quot;44-15669&quot;, at 1600 hrs PWT, headed for the East Coast. She took off into the wind, into an offshore fog bank, and was expected that night at Palm Springs. She never arrived. Owing to a paperwork foul-up, a search did not get under way for several days, and while the eventual search of land and sea was massive, it failed to find a trace of Silver or her plane. She is the only missing WASP pilot. She had married Sgt. Henry Silver one month before her disappearance.

===1960s===
* On January 13, 1969, Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 933, a Douglas DC-8-62, crashed into Santa Monica Bay, approximately west of LAX at 7:21 pm, local time. The aircraft was operating as flight SK933, nearing the completion of a flight from Seattle. Of nine crewmembers, three drowned, while 12 of the 36 passengers also drowned.
* On January 18, 1969, United Airlines Flight 266, a Boeing 727-100 bearing the registration number N7434U, crashed into Santa Monica Bay approximately west of LAX at 6:21 pm local time. The aircraft was destroyed, resulting in the death of all 32 passengers and six crew members aboard.

===1970s===
* On the evening of June 6, 1971, Hughes Airwest Flight 706, a Douglas DC-9 jetliner that had departed LAX on a flight to Salt Lake City, Utah, was struck nine minutes after takeoff by a U.S. Marine Corps McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter jet over the San Gabriel Mountains. The midair collision killed all 44 passengers and five crew members aboard the DC-9 airliner and one of two crewmen aboard the military jet.
* On August 4, 1971, Continental Airlines Flight 712, a Boeing 707, collided in midair with a Cessna 150 over Compton. Although the Cessna was destroyed upon landing, there were no fatalities.
* On August 6, 1974, a bomb exploded near the Pan Am ticketing area at Terminal 2; three people were killed and 35 were injured.
* On March 1, 1978, two tires burst in succession on a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 on Continental Airlines Flight 603 during its takeoff roll at LAX and the plane, bound for Honolulu, veered off the runway. A third tire burst and the DC-10&#x27;s left landing gear collapsed, causing a fuel tank to rupture. Following the aborted takeoff, spilled fuel ignited and enveloped the center portion of the aircraft in flames. During the ensuing emergency evacuation, a husband and wife died when they exited the passenger cabin onto the wing and dropped down directly into the flames. Two additional passengers died of their injuries approximately three months after the accident; 74 others aboard the plane were injured, as were 11 firemen battling the fire.
* On the evening of March 10, 1979, Swift Aire Flight 235, a twin-engine Aerospatiale Nord 262A-33 turboprop en route to Santa Maria, was forced to ditch in Santa Monica Bay after experiencing engine problems upon takeoff from LAX. The pilot, co-pilot, and a female passenger drowned when they were unable to exit the aircraft after the ditching. The female flight attendant and the three remaining passengers—two men and a pregnant woman—survived and were rescued by several pleasure boats and other watercraft in the vicinity.

===1980s===
* In January 1985, a woman was found dead in a suitcase that was lying on the baggage carousel for a while. The suitcase had arrived on a Lufthansa flight. The woman was later discovered to have been an Iranian citizen who had recently married another Iranian with UGreen card status. She had been denied a US visa in West Germany and therefore decided to enter the US in this way.
* On August 31, 1986, Aeroméxico Flight 498, a DC-9 en route from Mexico City, Mexico, to Los Angeles, began its descent into LAX when a Piper Cherokee collided with the DC-9&#x27;s left horizontal stabilizer over Cerritos, causing the DC-9 to crash into a residential neighborhood. All 67 people on the two aircraft were killed, in addition to 15 people on the ground. 5 homes were destroyed and an additional 7 were damaged by the crash and resulting fire. The Piper went down in a nearby schoolyard and caused no further injuries on the ground. As a result of this incident, the FAA required all commercial aircraft to be equipped with Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).

===1990s===
* On February 1, 1991, USAir Flight 1493 (arriving from Columbus, Ohio), a Boeing 737-300, landing on runway 24L at LAX, collided on touchdown with SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569, a Fairchild Metroliner, preparing to depart to Palmdale. The collision was caused by a controller who told the SkyWest plane to wait on the runway for takeoff, then later gave the USAir plane clearance to land on the same runway, forgetting that the SkyWest plane was there. The collision killed all 12 occupants of the SkyWest plane and 23 of the 89 people aboard the USAir 737.

===2000s===
* Al-Qaeda attempted to bomb LAX on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999/2000. The bomber, Algerian Ahmed Ressam, was captured in Port Angeles, Washington, the U.S. port of entry, with a cache of explosives that could have produced a blast 40 times greater than that of a car bomb hidden in the trunk of the rented car in which he had traveled from Canada. He had planned to leave one or two suitcases filled with explosives in an LAX passenger waiting area. He was initially sentenced to 22 years in prison, but in February 2010 an appellate court ordered that his sentence be extended.
* On January 31, 2000, Alaska Airlines Flight 261, attempted to land at LAX after experiencing problems with its tail-mounted horizontal stabilizer. Before the plane could divert to Los Angeles, it suddenly plummeted into the Pacific Ocean approximately north of Anacapa Island of the California coast, killing all 88 people aboard.
* During the September 11 attacks, American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175 and American Airlines Flight 77 were destined for LAX and they were hijacked mid-flight by Al-Qaeda terrorists. Flight 11 and Flight 175 deliberately crashed into the Twin Towers of World Trade Center and Flight 77 deliberately crashed into The Pentagon.
* In the 2002 Los Angeles International Airport shooting of July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet killed two Israelis at the ticket counter of El Al Airlines at LAX. Although the gunman was not linked to any terrorist group, the man was upset at U.S. support for Israel, and therefore was motivated by political disagreement. This led the FBI to classify this shooting as a terrorist act, one of the first on U.S. soil since the September 11 attacks.
* On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Flight 292, an Airbus A320 discovered a problem with its landing gear as it took off from Bob Hope Airport in Burbank. It flew in circles for three hours to burn off fuel, then landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport on runway 25L, balancing on its back wheels as it rolled down the center of the runway. Passengers were able to watch their own coverage live from the satellite broadcast on JetBlue in-flight TV seat displays of their plane as it made an emergency landing with the front landing gear visibly becoming damaged. Because JetBlue did not serve LAX at the time, the aircraft was evaluated and repaired at a Continental Airlines hangar.
* On 19 December 2005, Air India flight 136, a Boeing 747-400M (registered as VT-AIM) flying from Los Angeles to Delhi via Frankfurt, suffered a tire blowout after take-off. The plane dumped fuel and returned to Los Angeles after conducting an emergency landing. There were no injuries among 267 passengers and crew, however a woman passenger was hospitalized after fainting on landing.
* On June 2, 2006, an American Airlines Boeing 767 was about to complete a flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City when the plane&#x27;s pilots noted that the number 1 engine lagged the number 2 one by 2 percent. The plane landed safely and passengers disembarked, but when maintenance personnel retarded its throttle to idle, the number one engine, which had been put to maximum power, suffered an uncontained rupture of the high pressure turbine stage 1 disk, causing the engine to explode. There were no injuries among the three people on board the aircraft at the time (all of them maintenance workers), but the airplane was written off.
* On July 29, 2006, after America West Express Flight 6008, a Canadair Regional Jet operated by Mesa Airlines from Phoenix, Arizona, landed on runway 25L, controllers instructed the pilot to leave the runway on a taxiway known as &quot;Mike&quot; and stop short of runway 25R. Even though the pilot read back the instructions correctly, he accidentally taxied onto 25R and into the path of a departing SkyWest Airlines Embraer EMB-120 operating United Express Flight 6037 to Monterey. They cleared each other by and nobody was hurt.
* On August 16, 2007, a runway incursion occurred between WestJet Flight 900 and Northwest Airlines Flight 180 on runways 24R and 24L, respectively, with the aircraft coming within of each other. The planes were carrying a combined total of 296 people, none of whom were injured. The NTSB concluded that the incursion was the result of controller error. In September 2007, FAA Administrator Marion Blakey stressed the need for LAX to increase lateral separation between its pair of north runways in order to preserve the safety and efficiency of the airport.

===2010s===
* On October 13 and 14, 2013, two incidents of dry ice bomb explosions occurred at the airport. The first dry ice bomb exploded at 7:00 p.m. in an employee restroom in Terminal 2, with no injuries. Terminal 2 was briefly shut down as a result. On the next day at 8:30 p.m., a dry ice bomb exploded on the ramp area near the Tom Bradley International Terminal, also without injuries. Two other plastic bottles containing dry ice were found at the scene during the second explosion. On October 15, a 28-year-old airport employee was arrested in connection with the explosions and was booked on charges of possession of an explosive or destructive device near an aircraft. On October 18, a 41-year-old airport employee was arrested in connection with the second explosion, and was booked on suspicion of possessing a destructive device near an aircraft. Authorities believe that the incidents were not linked to terrorism. Both men subsequently pleaded no contest and were each sentenced to three years&#x27; probation. The airport workers had removed dry ice from a cargo hold into which a dog was to be loaded, because of fears that the dry ice could harm the animal.
* In the 2013 Los Angeles International Airport shooting of November 1, 2013, at around 9:31 a.m. PDT, a lone gunman entered Terminal 3 and opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle, killing a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer and wounding three other people. The gunman was later apprehended and taken into custody. Until the situation was clarified and under control, a few terminals at the airport were evacuated, all inbound flights were diverted and all outbound flights were grounded until the airport began returning to normal operation at around 2:30 p.m.
* On August 28, 2016, there was a false report of shots fired throughout the airport, causing a temporary lock down and about 3 hours of flight delays.
* On May 20, 2017, Aeroméxico Flight 642, a Boeing 737-800, collided with a utility truck on a taxiway near Runway 25R, injuring 8 people, two of them seriously.
* On July 25, 2018, jetblast from a Dash 8 caused some dollies to crash into a United 737.
* On November 21, 2019, Philippine Airlines Flight 113, operated by a Boeing 777-300ER suffered an engine compressor stall shortly after take off from the airport&#x27;s Runway 25R, forcing the flight to return. The flight made a successful emergency landing just 13 minutes after departure. There were 342 passengers and 18 crew on board the flight, with no injuries reported.

===2020s===
* On August 19, 2020, FedEx Express Flight 1026, a Boeing 767, made an emergency landing when its left main landing gear failed to extend. One of the pilots was injured while leaving the aircraft.
*On July 8, 2024, a Boeing 757-200 of United Airlines, registration N14107, was in the initial climb out of runway 25R bound for Denver when one of the main wheels detached. The aircraft continued to Denver and landed safely with no casualties.

==Aircraft spotting==
The &quot;Imperial Hill&quot; area of El Segundo is a prime location for aircraft spotting, especially for takeoffs. Part of the Imperial Hill area has been set aside as a city park, Clutter&#x27;s Park.

Another popular spotting location sits under the final approach for runways 24 L&amp;R on a lawn next to the Westchester In-N-Out Burger on Sepulveda Boulevard. This is one of the few remaining locations in Southern California from which spotters may watch such a wide variety of low-flying commercial airliners from directly underneath a flight path.

Another aircraft spotting location is at a small park in the take-off pattern that normally goes out over the Pacific. The park is on the east side of the street Vista Del Mar, from which it takes its name, Vista Del Mar Park.

===Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;===
At 12:51 p.m. on Friday, September 21, 2012, a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft carrying the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; landed at LAX on runway 25L. An estimated 10,000 people saw the shuttle land. Interstate 105 was backed up for miles at a standstill. Imperial Highway was shut down for spectators. It was quickly taken off the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, a modified Boeing 747, and was moved to a United Airlines hangar. The shuttle spent about a month in the hangar while it was prepared to be transported to the California Science Center.

==In popular culture==
Numerous films and television shows have been set or filmed partially at LAX, at least partly due to the airport&#x27;s proximity to Hollywood studios and Los Angeles. Film shoots at the Los Angeles airports, including LAX, produced $590 million for the Los Angeles region from 2002 to 2005.

<text>The La Tène culture (; ) was a European Iron Age culture. It developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from about 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC), succeeding the early Iron Age Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under considerable Mediterranean influence from the Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul, the Etruscans, and the Golasecca culture, but whose artistic style nevertheless did not depend on those Mediterranean influences.

La Tène culture&#x27;s territorial extent corresponded to what is now France, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, England, Southern Germany, the Czech Republic, Northern Italy and Central Italy, Slovenia, Hungary and Liechtenstein, as well as adjacent parts of the Netherlands, Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia, Transylvania (western Romania), and Transcarpathia (western Ukraine). The Celtiberians of western Iberia shared many aspects of the culture, though not generally the artistic style. To the north extended the contemporary Pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe, including the Jastorf culture of Northern Germany and Denmark and all the way to Galatia in Asia Minor (today Turkey).

Centered on ancient Gaul, the culture became very widespread, and encompasses a wide variety of local differences. It is often distinguished from earlier and neighbouring cultures mainly by the La Tène style of Celtic art, characterized by curving &quot;swirly&quot; decoration, especially of metalwork.

It is named after the type site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland, where thousands of objects had been deposited in the lake, as was discovered after the water level dropped in 1857 (due to the Jura water correction).

In the popular understanding, La Tène describes the culture and art of the ancient Celts, a term that is firmly entrenched in the popular understanding, but it is considered controversial by modern scholarship.

==Periodization==

Extensive contacts through trade are recognized in foreign objects deposited in elite burials; stylistic influences on La Tène material culture can be recognized in Etruscan, Italic, Greek, Dacian and Scythian sources. Datable Greek pottery and analysis employing scientific techniques such as dendrochronology and thermoluminescence help provide date ranges for an absolute chronology at some La Tène sites.

La Tène history was originally divided into &quot;early&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;late&quot; stages based on the typology of the metal finds (Otto Tischler 1885), with the Roman occupation greatly disrupting the culture, although many elements remain in Gallo-Roman and Romano-British culture. A broad cultural unity was not paralleled by overarching social-political unifying structures, and the extent to which the material culture can be linguistically linked is debated. The art history of La Tène culture has various schemes of periodization.

The archaeological period is now mostly divided into four sub-periods, following Paul Reinecke.

==History==

The preceding final phase of the Hallstatt culture, HaD, c. 650–450 BC, was also widespread across Central Europe, and the transition over this area was gradual, being mainly detected through La Tène style elite artefacts, which first appear on the western edge of the old Hallstatt region.

Though there is no agreement on the precise region in which La Tène culture first developed, there is a broad consensus that the centre of the culture lay on the northwest edges of Hallstatt culture, north of the Alps, within the region between in the West the valleys of the Marne and Moselle, and the part of the Rhineland nearby. In the east the western end of the old Hallstatt core area in modern Bavaria, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland formed a somewhat separate &quot;eastern style Province&quot; in the early La Tène, joining with the western area in Alsace. In 1994 a prototypical ensemble of elite grave sites of the early 5th century BCE was excavated at Glauberg in Hesse, northeast of Frankfurt-am-Main, in a region that had formerly been considered peripheral to the La Tène sphere. The site at La Tène itself was therefore near the southern edge of the original &quot;core&quot; area (as is also the case for the Hallstatt site for its core).

The establishment of a Greek colony, soon very successful, at Massalia (modern Marseilles) on the Mediterranean coast of France led to great trade with the Hallstatt areas up the Rhone and Saone river systems, and early La Tène elite burials like the Vix Grave in Burgundy contain imported luxury goods along with artifacts produced locally. Most areas were probably controlled by tribal chiefs living in hilltop forts, while the bulk of the population lived in small villages or farmsteads in the countryside.

By 500 BCE the Etruscans expanded to border Celts in north Italy, and trade across the Alps began to overhaul trade with the Greeks, and the Rhone route declined. Booming areas included the middle Rhine, with large iron ore deposits, the Marne and Champagne regions, and also Bohemia, although here trade with the Mediterranean area was much less important. Trading connections and wealth no doubt played a part in the origin of the La Tène style, though how large a part remains much discussed; specific Mediterranean-derived motifs are evident, but the new style does not depend on them.

Barry Cunliffe notes localization of La Tène culture during the 5th century BCE when there arose &quot;two zones of power and innovation: a Marne – Moselle zone in the west with trading links to the Po Valley via the central Alpine passes and the Golasecca culture, and a Bohemian zone in the east with separate links to the Adriatic via the eastern Alpine routes and the Venetic culture&quot;.

From their homeland, La Tène culture expanded in the 4th century BCE to more of modern France, Germany, and Central Europe, and beyond to Hispania, northern and central Italy, the Balkans, and even as far as Asia Minor, in the course of several major migrations. La Tène style artefacts start to appear in Britain around the same time, and Ireland rather later. The style of &quot;Insular La Tène&quot; art is somewhat different and the artefacts are initially found in some parts of the islands but not others. Migratory movements seem at best only partly responsible for the diffusion of La Tène culture there, and perhaps other parts of Europe.

By about 400 BCE, the evidence for Mediterranean trade becomes sparse; this may be because the expanding Celtic populations began to migrate south and west, coming into violent conflict with the established populations, including the Etruscans and Romans. The settled life in much of the La Tène homelands also seems to have become much more unstable and prone to wars. In about 387 BCE, the Celts under Brennus defeated the Romans and then sacked Rome, establishing themselves as the most prominent threats to the Roman homeland, a status they would retain through a series of Roman-Gallic wars until Julius Caesar&#x27;s final conquest of Gaul in 58–50 BCE. The Romans prevented the Celts from reaching very far south of Rome, but on the other side of the Adriatic Sea groups passed through the Balkans to reach Greece, where Delphi was attacked and sacked in 279 BCE, and Asia, where Galatia was established as a Celtic area of Anatolia. By this time, the La Tène style was spreading to the British Isles, though apparently without any significant movements in population.

After about 275 BCE, Roman expansion into the La Tène area began with the conquest of Gallia Cisalpina. The conquest of Gallia Celtica followed in 121 BCE and was complete with the Gallic Wars of the 50s BCE. Gaulish culture quickly assimilated to Roman culture, giving rise to the hybrid Gallo-Roman culture of Late Antiquity.

==Ethnology==

The bearers of the La Tène culture were the people known as Celts or Gauls to ancient ethnographers. Ancient Celtic culture had no written literature of its own, but rare examples of epigraphy in the Greek or Latin alphabets exist allowing the fragmentary reconstruction of Continental Celtic.

Current knowledge of this cultural area is derived from three sources comprising archaeological evidence, Greek and Latin literary records, and ethnographical evidence suggesting some La Tène artistic and cultural survivals in traditionally Celtic regions of far western Europe. 
Some of the societies that are archaeologically identified with La Tène material culture were identified by Greek and Roman authors from the 5th century onwards as &quot;Keltoi&quot; (&quot;Celts&quot;) and &quot;Galli&quot; (&quot;Gauls&quot;). Herodotus (iv.49) correctly placed &quot;Keltoi&quot; at the source of the Ister/Danube, in the heartland of La Tène material culture: &quot;The Ister flows right across Europe, rising in the country of the Celts&quot;.

Whether the usage of classical sources means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language, material culture, and political affiliation do not necessarily run parallel. Frey (2004) notes that in the 5th century, &quot;burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions&quot;.

==Material culture==

La Tène metalwork in bronze, iron and gold, developing technologically out of Hallstatt culture, is stylistically characterized by inscribed and inlaid intricate spirals and interlace, on fine bronze vessels, helmets and shields, horse trappings, and elite jewelry, especially the neck rings called torcs and elaborate clasps called &quot;fibulae&quot;. It is characterized by elegant, stylized curvilinear animal and vegetal forms, allied with the Hallstatt traditions of geometric patterning.

The Early Style of La Tène art and culture mainly featured static, geometric decoration, while the transition to the Developed Style constituted a shift to movement-based forms, such as triskeles. Some subsets within the Developed Style contain more specific design trends, such as the recurrent serpentine scroll of the Waldalgesheim Style.

Initially La Tène people lived in open settlements that were dominated by the chieftains&#x27; hill forts. The development of towns—&quot;oppida&quot;—appears in mid-La Tène culture. La Tène dwellings were carpenter-built rather than of masonry. La Tène peoples also dug ritual shafts, in which votive offerings and even human sacrifices were cast. Severed heads appear to have held great power and were often represented in carvings. Burial sites included weapons, carts, and both elite and household goods, evoking a strong continuity with an afterlife.

Elaborate burials also reveal a wide network of trade. In Vix, France, an elite woman of the 6th century BCE was buried with a very large bronze &quot;wine-mixer&quot; made in Greece. Exports from La Tène cultural areas to the Mediterranean cultures were based on salt, tin, copper, amber, wool, leather, furs and gold. Artefacts typical of the La Tène culture were also discovered in stray finds as far afield as Scandinavia, Northern Germany, Poland and in the Balkans. It is therefore common to also talk of the &quot;La Tène period&quot; in the context of those regions even though they were never part of the La Tène culture proper, but connected to its core area via trade.

==Type site==

The La Tène type site is on the northern shore of Lake Neuchâtel, Switzerland, where the small river Thielle, connecting to another lake, enters the Lake Neuchâtel. In 1857, prolonged drought lowered the waters of the lake by about . On the northernmost tip of the lake, between the river and a point south of the village of Epagnier (), Hansli Kopp, looking for antiquities for Colonel Frédéric Schwab, discovered several rows of wooden piles that still reached up about into the water. From among these, Kopp collected about forty iron swords.

The Swiss archaeologist Ferdinand Keller published his findings in 1868 in his influential first report on the Swiss pile dwellings (&quot;Pfahlbaubericht&quot;). In 1863 he interpreted the remains as a Celtic village built on piles. Eduard Desor, a geologist from Neuchâtel, started excavations on the lakeshore soon afterwards. He interpreted the site as an armory, erected on platforms on piles over the lake and later destroyed by enemy action. Another interpretation accounting for the presence of cast iron swords that had not been sharpened, was of a site for ritual depositions.

With the first systematic lowering of the Swiss lakes from 1868 to 1883, the site fell completely dry. In 1880, Emile Vouga, a teacher from Marin-Epagnier, uncovered the wooden remains of two bridges (designated &quot;Pont Desor&quot; and &quot;Pont Vouga&quot;) originally over long, that crossed the little Thielle River (today a nature reserve) and the remains of five houses on the shore. After Vouga had finished, F. Borel, curator of the Marin museum, began to excavate as well. In 1885 the canton asked the Société d&#x27;Histoire of Neuchâtel to continue the excavations, the results of which were published by Vouga in the same year.

All in all, over 2500 objects, mainly made from metal, have been excavated in La Tène. Weapons predominate, there being 166 swords (most without traces of wear), 270 lanceheads, and 22 shield bosses, along with 385 brooches, tools, and parts of chariots. Numerous human and animal bones were found as well. The site was used from the 3rd century, with a peak of activity around 200 BCE and abandonment by about 60 BCE. Interpretations of the site vary. Some scholars believe the bridge was destroyed by high water, while others see it as a place of sacrifice after a successful battle (there are almost no female ornaments).

An exhibition marking the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the La Tène site opened in 2007 at the Musée Schwab in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland, then Zürich in 2008 and Mont Beuvray in Burgundy in 2009.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;PLOS One&quot; in December 2018 examined 45 individuals buried at a La Tène necropolis in Urville-Nacqueville, France. The people buried there were identified as Gauls. The mtDNA of the examined individuals belonged primarily to haplotypes of H and U. They were found to be carrying a large amount of steppe ancestry, and to have been closely related to peoples of the preceding Bell Beaker culture, suggesting genetic continuity between Bronze Age and Iron Age France. Significant gene flow with Great Britain and Iberia was detected. The results of the study partially supported the notion that French people are largely descended from the Gauls.

A genetic study published in the &quot;Journal of Archaeological Science&quot; in October 2019 examined 43 maternal and 17 paternal lineages for the La Tène necropolis in Urville-Nacqueville, France, and 27 maternal and 19 paternal lineages for La Tène tumulus of Gurgy Les Noisats near modern Paris, France. The examined individuals displayed strong genetic resemblance to peoples of the earlier Yamnaya culture, Corded Ware culture and Bell Beaker culture. They carried a diverse set of maternal lineages associated with steppe ancestry. The paternal lineages were on the other hand characterized by a &quot;striking homogeneity&quot;, belonging entirely to haplogroup R and R1b, both of whom are associated with steppe ancestry. The evidence suggested that the Gauls of the La Tène culture were patrilineal and patrilocal, which is in agreement with archaeological and literary evidence.

A genetic study published in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&quot; in June 2020 examined the remains of 25 individuals ascribed to the La Tène culture. The nine examples of individual Y-DNA extracted were determined to belong to either the paragroups or subclades of haplogroups R1b1a1a2 (R-M269; three examples), R1b1a1a2a1a2c1a1a1a1a1 (R-M222), R1b1 (R-L278), R1b1a1a (R-P297), I1 (I-M253), E1b1b (E-M215), or other, unspecified, subclades of haplogroup R. The 25 samples of mtDNA extracted was determined to belong to various subclades of haplogroup H, HV, U, K, J, V and W. The examined individuals of the Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture were genetically highly homogeneous and displayed continuity with the earlier Bell Beaker culture. They carried about 50% steppe-related ancestry.

A genetic study published in iScience in April 2022 examined 49 genomes from 27 sites in Bronze Age and Iron Age France. The study found evidence of strong genetic continuity between the two periods, particularly in southern France. The samples from northern and southern France were highly homogeneous, with northern samples displaying links to contemporary samples form Great Britain and Sweden, and southern samples displaying links to Celtiberians. The northern French samples were distinguished from the southern ones by elevated levels of steppe-related ancestry. R1b was by far the most dominant paternal lineage, while H was the most common maternal lineage. The Iron Age samples resembled those of modern-day populations of France, Great Britain and Spain. The evidence suggested that the Gauls of the La Tène culture largely evolved from local Bronze Age populations.

<text>In economics, the Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of income or of wealth. It was developed by Max O. Lorenz in 1905 for representing inequality of the wealth distribution.

The curve is a graph showing the proportion of overall income or wealth assumed by the bottom &quot;x&quot;% of the people, although this is not rigorously true for a finite population (see below). It is often used to represent income distribution, where it shows for the bottom &quot;x&quot;% of households, what percentage (&quot;y&quot;%) of the total income they have. The percentage of households is plotted on the &quot;x&quot;-axis, the percentage of income on the &quot;y&quot;-axis. It can also be used to show distribution of assets. In such use, many economists consider it to be a measure of social inequality.

The concept is useful in describing inequality among the size of individuals in ecology and in studies of biodiversity, where the cumulative proportion of species is plotted against the cumulative proportion of individuals. It is also useful in business modeling: e.g., in consumer finance, to measure the actual percentage &quot;y&quot;% of delinquencies attributable to the &quot;x&quot;% of people with worst risk scores. Lorenz curves were also applied to epidemiology and public health, e.g., to measure pandemic inequality as the distribution of national cumulative incidence (y%) generated by the population residing in areas (x%) ranked with respect to their local epidemic attack rate.

==Explanation==
 Data from 2005.
Points on the Lorenz curve represent statements such as, &quot;the bottom 20% of all households have 10% of the total income.&quot;

A perfectly equal income distribution would be one in which every person has the same income. In this case, the bottom &quot;N&quot;% of society would always have &quot;N&quot;% of the income. This can be depicted by the straight line &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;; called the &quot;line of perfect equality.&quot;

By contrast, a perfectly unequal distribution would be one in which one person has all the income and everyone else has none. In that case, the curve would be at &quot;y&quot; = 0% for all &quot;x&quot; &lt; 100%, and &quot;y&quot; = 100% when &quot;x&quot; = 100%. This curve is called the &quot;line of perfect inequality.&quot;

The Gini coefficient is the ratio of the area between the line of perfect equality and the observed Lorenz curve to the area between the line of perfect equality and the line of perfect inequality. The higher the coefficient, the more unequal the distribution is. In the diagram on the right, this is given by the ratio &quot;A&quot;/(&quot;A&quot;+&quot;B&quot;), where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are the areas of regions as marked in the diagram.

== Definition and calculation==

The Lorenz curve is a probability plot (a P–P plot) comparing the distribution of a variable against a hypothetical uniform distribution of that variable. It can usually be represented by a function &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;), where &quot;F&quot;, the cumulative portion of the population, is represented by the horizontal axis, and &quot;L&quot;, the cumulative portion of the total wealth or income, is represented by the vertical axis.

The curve &quot;L&quot; need not be a smoothly increasing function of &quot;F&quot;, For wealth distributions there may be oligarchies or people with negative wealth for instance.

For a discrete distribution of Y given by values &quot;y&quot;1, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot; in non-decreasing order ( &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1) and their probabilities formula_1 the Lorenz curve is the continuous piecewise linear function connecting the points ( &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; ), &quot;i&quot; = 0 to &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;F&quot;0 = 0, &quot;L&quot;0 = 0, and for &quot;i&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot;:
formula_2

When all &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; are equally probable with probabilities 1/&quot;n&quot; this simplifies to 
formula_3

For a continuous distribution with the probability density function &quot;f&quot; and the cumulative distribution function &quot;F&quot;, the Lorenz curve &quot;L&quot; is given by:
formula_4
where formula_5 denotes the average. The Lorenz curve &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) may then be plotted as a function parametric in &quot;x&quot;: &quot;L&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) vs. &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). In other contexts, the quantity computed here is known as the length biased (or size biased) distribution; it also has an important role in renewal theory.

Alternatively, for a cumulative distribution function &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) with inverse &quot;x&quot;(&quot;F&quot;), the Lorenz curve &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) is directly given by:
formula_6

The inverse &quot;x&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) may not exist because the cumulative distribution function has intervals of constant values. However, the previous formula can still apply by generalizing the definition of &quot;x&quot;(&quot;F&quot;):
formula_7
where is the infimum.

For an example of a Lorenz curve, see Pareto distribution.

==Properties==

A Lorenz curve always starts at (0,0) and ends at (1,1).

The Lorenz curve is not defined if the mean of the probability distribution is zero or infinite.

The Lorenz curve for a probability distribution is a continuous function. However, Lorenz curves representing discontinuous functions can be constructed as the limit of Lorenz curves of probability distributions, the line of perfect inequality being an example.

The information in a Lorenz curve may be summarized by the Gini coefficient and the Lorenz asymmetry coefficient.

The Lorenz curve cannot rise above the line of perfect equality.

A Lorenz curve that never falls beneath a second Lorenz curve and at least once runs above it, has Lorenz dominance over the second one.

If the variable being measured cannot take negative values, the Lorenz curve:
*cannot sink below the line of perfect inequality,
*is increasing.
Note however that a Lorenz curve for net worth would start out by going negative due to the fact that some people have a negative net worth because of debt.

The Lorenz curve is invariant under positive scaling. If X is a random variable, for any positive number &quot;c&quot; the random variable &quot;c&quot; X has the same Lorenz curve as X.

The Lorenz curve is flipped twice, once about F = 0.5 and once about &quot;L&quot; = 0.5, by negation. If X is a random variable with Lorenz curve &quot;L&quot;X(&quot;F&quot;), then −X has the Lorenz curve:
: &quot;L&quot; − X = 1 − &quot;L&quot; X (1 − &quot;F&quot;)

The Lorenz curve is changed by translations so that the equality gap &quot;F&quot; − &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) changes in proportion to the ratio of the original and translated means. If X is a random variable with a Lorenz curve &quot;L&quot; X (&quot;F&quot;) and mean &quot;μ&quot; X , then for any constant &quot;c&quot; ≠ −&quot;μ&quot; X , X + &quot;c&quot; has a Lorenz curve defined by:
formula_8

For a cumulative distribution function &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) with mean &quot;μ&quot; and (generalized) inverse &quot;x&quot;(&quot;F&quot;), then for any &quot;F&quot; with 0 &lt; &quot;F&quot; &lt; 1 :
*If the Lorenz curve is differentiable:formula_9
*If the Lorenz curve is twice differentiable, then the probability density function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) exists at that point and: formula_10
*If &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) is continuously differentiable, then the tangent of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) is parallel to the line of perfect equality at the point &quot;F&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;). This is also the point at which the equality gap &quot;F&quot; − &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;), the vertical distance between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, is greatest. The size of the gap is equal to half of the relative mean absolute deviation: formula_11

<text>Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced in 1984 by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given as an explanation of how it works in a natural language, such as English, interspersed (embedded) with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated. The approach is used in scientific computing and in data science routinely for reproducible research and open access purposes. Literate programming tools are used by millions of programmers today.

The literate programming paradigm, as conceived by Donald Knuth, represents a move away from writing computer programs in the manner and order imposed by the compiler, and instead gives programmers macros to develop programs in the order demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts. Literate programs are written as an exposition of logic in more natural language in which macros are used to hide abstractions and traditional source code, more like the text of an essay. 

Literate programming (LP) tools are used to obtain two representations from a source file: one understandable by a compiler or interpreter, the &quot;tangled&quot; code, and another for viewing as formatted documentation, which is said to be &quot;woven&quot; from the literate source. While the first generation of literate programming tools were computer language-specific, the later ones are language-agnostic and exist beyond the individual programming languages.

== History and philosophy ==
Literate programming was first introduced in 1984 by Donald Knuth, who intended it to create programs that were suitable literature for human beings. He implemented it at Stanford University as a part of his research on algorithms and digital typography. The implementation was called &quot;WEB&quot; since he believed that it was one of the few three-letter words of English that had not yet been applied to computing. However, it resembles the complicated nature of software delicately pieced together from simple materials. The practice of literate programming has seen an important resurgence in the 2010s with the use of computational notebooks, especially in data science.

== Concept ==
Literate programming is writing out the program logic in a human language with included (separated by a primitive markup) code snippets and macros. Macros in a literate source file are simply title-like or explanatory phrases in a human language that describe human abstractions created while solving the programming problem, and hiding chunks of code or lower-level macros. These macros are similar to the algorithms in pseudocode typically used in teaching computer science. These arbitrary explanatory phrases become precise new operators, created on the fly by the programmer, forming a &quot;meta-language&quot; on top of the underlying programming language.

A preprocessor is used to substitute arbitrary hierarchies, or rather &quot;interconnected &#x27;webs&#x27; of macros&quot;, to produce the compilable source code with one command (&quot;tangle&quot;), and documentation with another (&quot;weave&quot;). The preprocessor also provides an ability to write out the content of the macros and to add to already created macros in any place in the text of the literate program source file, thereby disposing of the need to keep in mind the restrictions imposed by traditional programming languages or to interrupt the flow of thought.

=== Advantages ===
According to Knuth,
literate programming provides higher-quality programs, since it forces programmers to explicitly state the thoughts behind the program, making poorly thought-out design decisions more obvious. Knuth also claims that literate programming provides a first-rate documentation system, which is not an add-on, but is grown naturally in the process of exposition of one&#x27;s thoughts during a program&#x27;s creation. The resulting documentation allows the author to restart their own thought processes at any later time, and allows other programmers to understand the construction of the program more easily. This differs from traditional documentation, in which a programmer is presented with source code that follows a compiler-imposed order, and must decipher the thought process behind the program from the code and its associated comments. The meta-language capabilities of literate programming are also claimed to facilitate thinking, giving a higher &quot;bird&#x27;s eye view&quot; of the code and increasing the number of concepts the mind can successfully retain and process. Applicability of the concept to programming on a large scale, that of commercial-grade programs, is proven by an edition of TeX code as a literate program.

Knuth also claims that literate programming can lead to easy porting of software to multiple environments, and even cites the implementation of TeX as an example.

=== Contrast with documentation generation ===
Literate programming is very often misunderstood to refer only to formatted documentation produced from a common file with both source code and comments – which is properly called documentation generation – or to voluminous commentaries included with code. This is the converse of literate programming: well-documented code or documentation extracted from code follows the structure of the code, with documentation embedded in the code; while in literate programming, code is embedded in documentation, with the code following the structure of the documentation.

This misconception has led to claims that comment-extraction tools, such as the Perl Plain Old Documentation or Java Javadoc systems, are &quot;literate programming tools&quot;. However, because these tools do not implement the &quot;web of abstract concepts&quot; hiding behind the system of natural-language macros, or provide an ability to change the order of the source code from a machine-imposed sequence to one convenient to the human mind, they cannot properly be called literate programming tools in the sense intended by Knuth.

== Workflow ==
Implementing literate programming consists of two steps:

# Weaving: Generating a comprehensive document about the program and its maintenance.
# Tangling: Generating machine executable code

Weaving and tangling are done on the same source so that they are consistent with each other.

== Example ==

A classic example of literate programming is the literate implementation of the standard Unix codice_1 word counting program. Knuth presented a CWEB version of this example in Chapter 12 of his &quot;Literate Programming&quot; book. The same example was later rewritten for the noweb literate programming tool. This example provides a good illustration of the basic elements of literate programming.

=== Creation of macros ===
The following snippet of the codice_2 literate program shows how arbitrary descriptive phrases in a natural language are used in a literate program to create macros, which act as new &quot;operators&quot; in the literate programming language, and hide chunks of code or other macros. The mark-up notation consists of double angle brackets (codice_3) that indicate macros. The codice_4 symbol which, in a noweb file, indicates the beginning of a documentation chunk. The codice_5 symbol stands for the &quot;root&quot;, topmost node the literate programming tool will start expanding the web of macros from. Actually, writing out the expanded source code can be done from any section or subsection (i.e. a piece of code designated as codice_6, with the equal sign), so one literate program file can contain several files with machine source code.

The purpose of wc is to count lines, words, and/or characters in a list of files. The
number of lines in a file is .../more explanations/

Here, then, is an overview of the file wc.c that is defined by the noweb program wc.nw:
 «Header files to include»
 «Definitions»
 «Global variables»
 «Functions»
 «The main program»

We must include the standard I/O definitions, since we want to send formatted output
to stdout and stderr.
 «Header files to include»=
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

The unraveling of the chunks can be done in any place in the literate program text file, not necessarily in the order they are sequenced in the enclosing chunk, but as is demanded by the logic reflected in the explanatory text that envelops the whole program.

=== Program as a web ===
Macros are not the same as &quot;section names&quot; in standard documentation. Literate programming macros hide the real code behind themselves, and be used inside any low-level machine language operators, often inside logical operators such as codice_7, codice_8 or codice_9. This can be seen in the following codice_2 literate program.
The present chunk, which does the counting, was actually one of
the simplest to write. We look at each character and change state if it begins or ends
a word.

 «Scan file»=
 while (1) {
 «Fill buffer if it is empty; break at end of file»
 c = *ptr++;
 if (c &gt; &#x27; &#x27; &amp;&amp; c &lt; 0177) {
 /* visible ASCII codes */
 if (!in_word) {
 word_count++;
 in_word = 1;
 continue;
 if (c == &#x27;\n&#x27;) line_count++;
 else if (c != &#x27; &#x27; &amp;&amp; c != &#x27;\t&#x27;) continue;
 in_word = 0;
 /* c is newline, space, or tab */
 @
The macros stand for any chunk of code or other macros, and are more general than top-down or bottom-up &quot;chunking&quot;, or than subsectioning. Donald Knuth said that when he realized this, he began to think of a program as a &quot;web&quot; of various parts.

=== Order of human logic, not that of the compiler ===
In a noweb literate program besides the free order of their exposition, the chunks behind macros, once introduced with codice_11, can be grown later in any place in the file by simply writing codice_6 and adding more content to it, as the following snippet illustrates (codice_13 is added by the document formatter for readability, and is not in the code).

=== Record of the train of thought ===
The documentation for a literate program is produced as part of writing the program. Instead of comments provided as side notes to source code a literate program contains the explanation of concepts on each level, with lower level concepts deferred to their appropriate place, which allows for better communication of thought. The snippets of the literate codice_2 above show how an explanation of the program and its source code are interwoven. Such exposition of ideas creates the flow of thought that is like a literary work. Knuth wrote a &quot;novel&quot; which explains the code of the interactive fiction game Colossal Cave Adventure.

=== Remarkable examples ===
* Axiom, which is evolved from Scratchpad, a computer algebra system developed by IBM. It is now being developed by Tim Daly, one of the developers of Scratchpad, Axiom is totally written as a literate program.

== Literate programming practices ==

The first published literate programming environment was WEB, introduced by Knuth in 1981 for his TeX typesetting system; it uses Pascal as its underlying programming language and TeX for typesetting of the documentation. The complete commented TeX source code was published in Knuth&#x27;s &quot;TeX: The program&quot;, volume B of his 5-volume &quot;Computers and Typesetting&quot;. Knuth had privately used a literate programming system called DOC as early as 1979. He was inspired by the ideas of Pierre-Arnoul de Marneffe. The free CWEB, written by Knuth and Silvio Levy, is WEB adapted for C and C++, runs on most operating systems, and can produce TeX and PDF documentation.

There are various other implementations of the literate programming concept as given below. Many of the newer among these do not have macros and hence do not comply with the order of human logic principle, which makes them perhaps &quot;semi-literate&quot; tools. These, however, allow cellular execution of code which makes them more along the lines of exploratory programming tools.

<text>The logistic map is a discrete dynamical system defined by the quadratic difference equation:

Equivalently it is a recurrence relation and a polynomial mapping of degree 2. It is often referred to as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple nonlinear dynamical equations.

The map was initially utilized by Edward Lorenz in the 1960s to showcase properties of irregular solutions in climate systems. It was popularized in a 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May, in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation written down by Pierre François Verhulst.
Other researchers who have contributed to the study of the logistic map include Stanisław Ulam, John von Neumann, Pekka Myrberg, Oleksandr Sharkovsky, Nicholas Metropolis, and Mitchell Feigenbaum.

== Two introductory examples ==
=== Dynamical Systems example ===

In the logistic map, r is a parameter, and x is a variable. It is a map in the sense that it maps a configuration or phase space to itself (in this simple case the space is one dimensional in the variable x)
:formula_1
It can be interpreted as a tool to get next position in the configuration space after one time step. The difference equation is a discrete version of the logistic differential equation, which can be compared to a time evolution equation of the system. 

Given an appropriate value for the parameter r and performing calculations starting from an initial condition formula_2, you will obtain the sequence formula_2, formula_4, formula_5, ... which can be interpreted as a sequence of time steps in the evolution of the system. 

In the field of dynamical systems, this sequence is called an orbit, and the orbit changes depending on the value given to the parameter. When the parameter is changed, the orbit of the logistic map can change in various ways, such as settling on a single value, repeating several values periodically, or showing non-periodic fluctuations known as chaos.

Another way to understand this sequence is to iterate the logistic map (here represented by formula_6) to the initial state formula_2
:formula_8
Now this is important given this was the initial approach of Henri Poincaré to study dynamical systems and ultimately chaos starting from the study of fixed points or in other words states that do not change over time (i.e. when formula_9). Many chaotic systems such as the Mandelbrot set are emerging from iteration of very simple quadratic non linear functions such as the logistic map.

=== Demographic model example ===

Taking the biological population model as an example is a number between zero and one, which represents the ratio of existing population to the maximum possible population. 
This nonlinear difference equation is intended to capture two effects:
* &quot;reproduction&quot;, where the population will increase at a rate proportional to the current population when the population size is small,
* &quot;starvation&quot; (density-dependent mortality), where the growth rate will decrease at a rate proportional to the value obtained by taking the theoretical &quot;carrying capacity&quot; of the environment less the current population.

The usual values of interest for the parameter are those in the interval , so that remains bounded on . The case of the logistic map is a nonlinear transformation of both the bit-shift map and the case of the tent map. If , this leads to negative population sizes. (This problem does not appear in the older Ricker model, which also exhibits chaotic dynamics.) One can also consider values of in the interval , so that remains bounded on .



== Characterization of the logistic map ==

The animation shows the behaviour of the sequence formula_10 over different values of the parameter r. A first observation is that the sequence does not diverge and remains finite for r between 0 and 4. It is possible to see the following qualitative phenomena in order of time: 
* exponential convergence to zero
* convergence to a non-zero fixed value
* initial oscillation and then convergence 
* stable oscillations between two values 
* growing oscillations between a set of values which are multiples of two such as 2,4,8,16 etc.
* Intermittency (i.e. sprouts of oscillations at the onset of chaos)
* fully developed chaotic oscillations
* topological mixing (i.e. the tendency of oscillations to cover the full available space).
The first 4 are also avalilable in standard linear systems, oscillations between two values are available too under resonance, chaotic systems though have typically a large range of resonance conditions.
The other phenomena are peculiar to chaos. This progression of stages is strikingly similar to the onset of turbulence.
Chaos is not peculiar to non-linear systems alone and it can also be exhibited by infinite dimensional linear systems.

As mentioned above, the logistic map itself is an ordinary quadratic function. An important question in terms of dynamical systems is how the behavior of the trajectory changes when the parameter r changes. Depending on the value of r, the behavior of the trajectory of the logistic map can be simple or complex. Below, we will explain how the behavior of the logistic map changes as r increases.

=== Domain, graphs and fixed points ===

As mentioned above, the logistic map can be used as a model to consider the fluctuation of population size. In this case, the variable x of the logistic map is the number of individuals of an organism divided by the maximum population size, so the possible values of x are limited to 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. For this reason, the behavior of the logistic map is often discussed by limiting the range of the variable to the interval [0, 1].

If we restrict the variables to 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, then the range of the parameter r is necessarily restricted to 0 to 4 (0 ≤ r ≤ 4). This is because if formula_10 is in the range [0, 1], then the maximum value of formula_12 is
r/4. Thus, when r &gt; 4, the value of formula_13 can exceed 1. On the other hand, when r is negative, x can take negative values.

A graph of the map can also be used to learn much about its behavior. The graph of the logistic map formula_14 is the plane curve that plots the relationship between formula_10 and formula_12, with formula_10 (or x) on the horizontal axis and formula_18 (or f (x)) on the vertical axis. The graph  of the logistic map looks like this, except for the case r = 0:

It has the shape of a parabola with a vertex at 
\right)}&lt;/math&gt;|}} 
When r is changed, the vertex moves up or down, and the shape of the parabola changes. In addition, the parabola of the logistic map intersects with the horizontal axis (the line where formula_19) at two points. The two intersection points are formula_20 and formula_21, and the positions of these intersection points are constant and do not depend on the value of r.

Graphs of maps, especially those of one variable such as the logistic map, are key to understanding the behavior of the map. One of the uses of graphs is to illustrate fixed points, called points. Draw a line y = x (a 45° line) on the graph of the map. If there is a point where this 45° line intersects with the graph, that point is a fixed point. In mathematical terms, a fixed point is

It means a point that does not change when the map is applied. We will denote the fixed point as formula_22. In the case of the logistic map, the fixed point that satisfies equation (2-2) is obtained by solving formula_23.
&lt;/math&gt; |}}
(except for r = 0). The concept of fixed points is of primary importance in discrete dynamical systems.

Another graphical technique that can be used for one-variable mappings is the spider web projection. After determining an initial value formula_2 on the horizontal axis, draw a vertical line from the initial value formula_2 to the curve of f(x). Draw a horizontal line from the  point where the curve of f(x) meets the 45° line of y = x, and then draw a vertical line from the point where the curve meets the 45° line to the curve of f(x). By repeating this process, a spider web or staircase-like diagram is created on the plane. This construction is in fact equivalent to calculating the trajectory graphically, and the spider web diagram created represents the trajectory starting from formula_2. This projection allows the overall behavior of the trajectory to be seen at a glance.

===Behavior dependent on ===
The image below shows the amplitude and frequency content of a logistic map that iterates itself for parameter values ranging from 2 to 4. Again one can see initial linear behaviours then chaotic behaviour not only in the time domain (left) but especially in the frequency domain or spectrum (right), i.e. chaos is present at all scales as it is in the case of Energy cascade of Kolmogorov and it even propagates from one scale to another.

By varying the parameter , the following behavior is observed:

==== Case when 0 ≤ r &lt; 1 ====
First, when the parameter r = 0, formula_27, regardless of the initial value formula_2. In other words, the trajectory of the logistic map when a = 0 is an trajectory in which all values after the initial value are 0, so there is not much to investigate in this case.

Next, when the parameter r is in the range 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, formula_10 decreases monotonically for any value of formula_2 between 0 and 1. That is, formula_10 converges to 0 in the limit n → ∞. 
 The point to which formula_10 converges is the fixed point formula_33 shown in equation (2-3). Fixed points of  this type, where orbits around them converge, are called asymptotically stable, stable, or attractive. Conversely, if orbits around formula_22 move away from formula_22 as time n increases, the fixed point formula_22 is called unstable or repulsive. 
A common and simple way to know whether a fixed point is asymptotically stable is to take the derivative of the map f. This derivative is expressed as formula_37,
formula_22 is asymptotically stable if the following condition is satisfied.

We can see this by graphing the map: if the slope of the tangent to the curve at formula_22 is between −1 and 1, then formula_22 is stable and the orbit around it is attracted to formula_22. The derivative of the logistic map is

Therefore, for x = 0 and 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, 0 &lt; f  &#x27;(0) &lt; 1, so the fixed point formula_33 = 0  satisfies equation (3-1).

However, the discrimination method using equation (3-1) does not know the range of orbits from formula_22 that are attracted to formula_22. It only guarantees that x within a certain neighborhood of formula_22 will converge. In this case, the domain of initial values that converge to 0 is the entire domain [0, 1], but to know this for certain, a separate study is required.

The method for determining whether a fixed point is unstable can be found by similarly differentiating the map. For r&lt;1 if a fixed point formula_22 is unstable if

If the parameter lies in the range 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, then the other fixed point formula_47
is negative and therefore does not lie in the range [0, 1], but it does exist as an unstable fixed point.

==== Case when 1 ≤ r ≤ 2 ====
In the general case with between 1 and 2, the population will quickly approach the value , independent of the initial population.

When the parameter r = 1, the trajectory of the logistic map converges to 0 as before, but the convergence speed is slower at r = 1. The fixed point 0 at r = 1 is asymptotically stable, but does not satisfy equation (3-1). In fact, the discrimination method based on equation (3-1) works by approximating the map to the first order near the fixed point. When r = 1, this approximation does not hold, and stability or instability is determined by the quadratic (square) terms of the map, or in order words the second order perturbation.

When r = 1 is graphed, the curve is tangent to the 45° diagonal at x = 0. In this case, the fixed point formula_48, which exists in the negative range for formula_49, is formula_50.
For formula_51, that is, as r increases, the value of formula_52 approaches 0, and just at r = 1  , formula_52 collides with  formula_54. This collision gives rise to a phenomenon known as a transcritical bifurcation.
Bifurcation is a term used to describe a qualitative change in the behavior of a dynamical system. In this case, transcritical bifurcation is when the stability of fixed points alternates between each other. That is, when r is less than 1, formula_33 is stable and formula_52 is unstable, but when r is greater than 1, formula_33 is unstable and formula_52 is stable. The parameter  values at which bifurcation occurs are called bifurcation points. In this case, r = 1 is the bifurcation point.

As a result of the bifurcation, the orbit of the logistic map converges to the limit point formula_48 instead of formula_54. In particular, if the parameter formula_61, then the trajectory starting from a value formula_2in the interval (0, 1), exclusive of 0 and 1, converges to formula_52 by increasing or decreasing monotonically. The difference in the convergence pattern depends on the range of the initial value. formula_64

In the case of formula_65
Then, it converges monotonically, 
formula_66, the function converges monotonically except for the first step.

Furthermore, the fixed point formula_54 becomes unstable due to bifurcation, but continues to exist as a fixed point even after r &gt; 1. This does not mean that there is no initial value other than formula_33 itself that  can reach this unstable fixed point  formula_33. This is formula_70, and since the logistic map satisfies f (1) = 0 regardless of the value of r,  applying the map once to formula_70 maps it to formula_54. A point such as x = 1 that can be reached directly as a fixed point by a  finite number of iterations of the map is called a final fixed point.

==== Case when 2 ≤ r ≤ 3 ====
With between 2 and 3, the population will also eventually approach the same value , but first will fluctuate around that value for some time. The rate of convergence is linear, except for , when it is dramatically slow, less than linear (see Bifurcation memory).

When the parameter 2 &lt; r &lt; 3, except for the initial values 0 and 1, the fixed point formula_48 is the same as when 1 &lt; r ≤ 2.
However, in this case the convergence is not monotonically. As the variable approaches formula_52, it becomes larger and smaller than formula_52 repeatedly, and follows a convergent trajectory that oscillates around formula_52.

. The value that is mapped to formula_52 by applying the mapping once is formula_78


In general, bifurcation diagrams are useful for understanding bifurcations. These diagrams are graphs of fixed points (or periodic points, as described below) x as a function of a parameter a, with a on the horizontal axis and x on the vertical axis. To distinguish between stable and unstable fixed points, the former curves are sometimes drawn as solid lines and the latter as dotted lines. When drawing a bifurcation diagram for the logistic map, we have a straight line representing the fixed point formula_54  and a straight line representing the fixed point formula_80
It can be seen that the curves representing a and b intersect at r = 1, and that stability is switched between the two.
==== Case when 3 ≤ r ≤ 3.44949 ====
In the general case With between 3 and 1 +  ≈ 3.44949 the population will approach permanent oscillations between two values. These two values are dependent on and given by formula_81.

When the parameter is exactly r = 3, the orbit also has a fixed point formula_82. 
However, the variables converge more slowly than when formula_83. When formula_84, the derivative formula_85 reaches −1 and no longer satisfies equation (3-1). When r exceeds 3, formula_86, and formula_52 becomes  an unstable fixed point. That is, another bifurcation occurs at formula_84.

For formula_84 a type of bifurcation known as a period doubling bifurcation occurs. For formula_90, the orbit no longer converges to a single point, but instead alternates between large and small values even after a sufficient amount of time has passed. For example, for formula_91, the variable alternates between the values 0.4794... and 0.8236...

An orbit that cycles through the same values periodically is called a periodic orbit. In this case, the final behavior of the variable as n → ∞ is a periodic orbit with two periods. Each value (point) that makes up a periodic orbit is called a periodic point. In the example where a = 3.3, 0.4794... and 0.8236... are periodic points. If a certain x is a periodic point, then in the case of two periodic points, applying the map twice to x will return it to its original state, so
If we apply the logistic map equation (1-4) to this equation, we get
This gives us the following fourth-order equation. The solutions of this equation are the periodic points. In fact, there are two fixed points formula_54 and formula_47
also satisfies equation (3-4). Therefore, of the solutions to equation (3-5), two correspond to formula_33 and formula_52, and the remaining two solutions are 2-periodic points. Let the 2-periodic points be denoted as formula_96 and formula_97, respectively. By solving equation (3-5), we can obtain them as follows

{2r}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

A similar theory about the stability of fixed points can also be applied to periodic points. That is, a periodic point that attracts surrounding orbits is called an asymptotically stable periodic point, and a periodic point where the surrounding orbits move away is called an unstable periodic point. It is possible to determine the stability of periodic points in the same way as for fixed points. In the general case, consider formula_98 after k iterations of the map. 
Let formula_99 be the derivative  formula_100 of the k-periodic point formula_101. If formula_101 satisfies:

then formula_101 is asymptotically stable.

then formula_101 is unstable.

The above discussion of the stability of periodic points can be easily understood by drawing a graph, just like the fixed points. In this diagram, the horizontal axis is xn and the vertical axis is formula_105, and a curve is drawn that shows the relationship between formula_105 and formula_10. The intersections of this curve and the 45° line are points that satisfy equation (3-4), so the intersections represent fixed points and 2-periodic points. If we draw a graph of the logistic map formula_108, we can observe that the slope of the tangent at the fixed point formula_52 exceeds  1 at the boundary formula_110 and becomes unstable. At the same time, two new intersections appear, which are the periodic points formula_96 and formula_97.
When we actually calculate the differential coefficients of two periodic points for the logistic map, we get
 
When this is applied to equation (3-7), the parameter a becomes:

It can be seen that the 2-periodic points are asymptotically stable when this range is formula_113, i.e., when r exceeds formula_114, the 2-periodic points are no longer asymptotically stable and their behavior changes.

Almost all initial values in [0, 1] are attracted to the 2-periodic points, but formula_115 and formula_47
remains as an unstable fixed point in [0,1]. These unstable fixed points continue to remain in [0,1] even if r is increased. Therefore, when the initial value is exactly formula_33 or formula_52, the orbit  does not attract to a 2-periodic point. Moreover, when the initial value is the final fixed point for formula_33 or the final fixed point for formula_52, the orbit does not attract to a 2-periodic point. There are an infinite number of such final fixed points in [0, 1]. However, the number of such points is negligibly small compared to the set of real numbers [ 0, 1].

==== Case when 3.44949 ≤ r ≤ 3.56995 ====
With between 3.44949 and 3.54409 (approximately), from almost all initial conditions the population will approach permanent oscillations among four values. The latter number is a root of a 12th degree polynomial .

With increasing beyond 3.54409, from almost all initial conditions the population will approach oscillations among 8 values, then 16, 32, etc. The lengths of the parameter intervals that yield oscillations of a given length decrease rapidly; the ratio between the lengths of two successive bifurcation intervals approaches the Feigenbaum constant . This behavior is an example of a period-doubling cascade.

When the parameter r exceeds formula_114, the previously stable 2-periodic points become unstable, stable 4-periodic points are generated, and the orbit gravitates toward a 4-periodic oscillation. That is, a period-doubling bifurcation occurs again at formula_122. The value of x at the 4-periodic point is also

satisfies, so that solving this equation allows the values of x at the 4-periodic points to be found. However, equation (3-11) is a 16th-order equation, and even if we factor out the four solutions for the fixed points and the 2-periodic points, it is still a 12th-order equation. Therefore, it is no longer possible to solve this equation to obtain an explicit function of a that represents the values of the 4-periodic points in the same way as for the 2-periodic points.

As a becomes larger, the stable 4-periodic point undergoes another period doubling, resulting in a stable 8-periodic point. As an increases, period doubling bifurcations occur infinitely: 16, 32, 64, ..., and so on, until an infinite period, i.e., an orbit that never returns to its original value. This infinite series of period doubling bifurcations is called a cascade. While these period doubling bifurcations occur infinitely, the intervals between a at which they occur decrease in a geometric progression. Thus, an infinite number of period doubling bifurcations occur before the parameter a reaches a finite value. Let the bifurcation from period 1 to period 2 that occurs at r = 3 be counted as the first period doubling bifurcation. Then, in this cascade of period doubling bifurcations, a stable 2k-periodic point occurs at the k-th bifurcation point. Let the k-th bifurcation point a be denoted as a k. In this case, it is known that formula_123 converges to the following value as k → ∞.

Furthermore, it is known that the rate of decrease of a k reaches a constant value in the limit, as shown in the following equation.

{r_{k+1}-r_{k}}}=4.66920...&lt;/math&gt;|}}

This value of δ is called the Feigenbaum constant because it was discovered by mathematical physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum. a∞ is called the Feigenbaum point. In the period doubling cascade, formula_124  and formula_125 have the property that they are locally identical after an appropriate scaling transformation. The Feigenbaum constant can be found by a technique called renormalization that exploits this self-similarity. The properties that the logistic map exhibits in the period doubling cascade are also universal in a broader class of maps, as will be discussed later. 

To get an overview of the final behavior of an orbit for a certain parameter, an approximate bifurcation diagram, orbital diagram, is useful. In this diagram, the horizontal axis is the parameter r and the vertical axis is the variable x, as in the bifurcation diagram. Using a computer, the parameters are determined and, for example, 500 iterations are performed. Then, the first 100 results are ignored and only the results of the remaining 400 are plotted. This allows the initial transient behavior to be ignored and the asymptotic behavior of the orbit remains. For example, when one point is plotted for r, it is a fixed point, and when m points are plotted for r, it corresponds to an m-periodic orbit. When an orbital diagram is drawn for the logistic map, it is possible to see how the branch representing the stable periodic orbit splits, which represents a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations.
When the parameter formula_126 is exactly the accumulation point of the period-doubling cascade, the variable formula_10 is attracted to aperiodic orbits that never close. In other words, there exists a periodic point with infinite period at formula_128. This aperiodic orbit is called the Feigenbaum attractor. The critical formula_129 attractor. An attractor is a term used to refer to a region that has the property of attracting surrounding orbits, and is the orbit that is eventually drawn into and continues. The attractive fixed points and periodic points mentioned above are also members of the attractor family.

The structure of the Feigenbaum attractor is the same as that of a fractal figure called the Cantor set. The number of points that compose the Feigenbaum attractor is infinite and their cardinality is equal to the real numbers. However, no matter which two of the points are chosen, there is always an unstable periodic point between them, and the distribution of the points is not continuous. The fractal dimension of the Feigenbaum attractor, the Hausdorff dimension or capacity dimension, is known to be approximately 0.54.
==== Case when 3.56995 &lt; r &lt; 4 ====
===== Qualitative Summary =====

* At is the onset of chaos, at the end of the period-doubling cascade. From almost all initial conditions, we no longer see oscillations of finite period. Slight variations in the initial population yield dramatically different results over time, a prime characteristic of chaos.
* This number shall be compared and understood as the equivalent of the Reynolds number for the onset of other chaotic phenomena such as turbulence and similar to the critical temperature of a phase transition. In essence the phase space contains a full subspace of cases with extra dynamical variables to characterize the microscopic state of the system, these can be understood as Eddies in the case of turbulence and order parameters in the case of phase transitions.
* Most values of beyond 3.56995 exhibit chaotic behaviour, but there are still certain isolated ranges of that show non-chaotic behavior; these are sometimes called &quot;islands of stability&quot;. For instance, beginning at 1 +  (approximately 3.82843) there is a range of parameters that show oscillation among three values, and for slightly higher values of oscillation among 6 values, then 12 etc.
* At formula_130, the stable period-3 cycle emerges.
* The development of the chaotic behavior of the logistic sequence as the parameter varies from approximately 3.56995 to approximately 3.82843 is sometimes called the Pomeau–Manneville scenario, characterized by a periodic (laminar) phase interrupted by bursts of aperiodic behavior. Such a scenario has an application in semiconductor devices. There are other ranges that yield oscillation among 5 values etc.; all oscillation periods occur for some values of . A &quot;period-doubling window&quot; with parameter is a range of -values consisting of a succession of subranges. The th subrange contains the values of for which there is a stable cycle (a cycle that attracts a set of initial points of unit measure) of period . This sequence of sub-ranges is called a &quot;cascade of harmonics&quot;. In a sub-range with a stable cycle of period , there are unstable cycles of period for all . The value at the end of the infinite sequence of sub-ranges is called the &quot;point of accumulation&quot; of the cascade of harmonics. As rises there is a succession of new windows with different values. The first one is for ; all subsequent windows involving odd occur in decreasing order of starting with arbitrarily large . 
* At formula_131, two chaotic bands of the bifurcation diagram intersect in the first Misiurewicz point for the logistic map. It satisfies the equations formula_132. 
* Beyond , almost all initial values eventually leave the interval and diverge. The set of initial conditions which remain within form a Cantor set and the dynamics restricted to this Cantor set is chaotic.

For any value of there is at most one stable cycle. If a stable cycle exists, it is globally stable, attracting almost all points. Some values of with a stable cycle of some period have infinitely many unstable cycles of various periods.

The bifurcation diagram at right summarizes this. The horizontal axis shows the possible values of the parameter while the vertical axis shows the set of values of visited asymptotically from almost all initial conditions by the iterates of the logistic equation with that value.

The bifurcation diagram is a self-similar: if we zoom in on the above-mentioned value and focus on one arm of the three, the situation nearby looks like a shrunk and slightly distorted version of the whole diagram. The same is true for all other non-chaotic points. This is an example of the deep and ubiquitous connection between chaos and fractals.


We can also consider negative values of :
* For between -2 and -1 the logistic sequence also features chaotic behavior.
* With between -1 and 1 -  and for 0 between 1/ and 1-1/, the population will approach permanent oscillations between two values, as with the case of between 3 and 1 + , and given by the same formula.
=====The Emergence of Chaos=====
When the parameter r exceeds formula_133, the logistic map exhibits chaotic behavior. Roughly speaking, chaos is a complex and irregular behavior that occurs despite the fact that the difference equation describing the logistic map has no probabilistic ambiguity and the next state is completely and uniquely determined. The range of formula_134 of the logistic map is called the chaotic region.

One of the properties of chaos is its unpredictability, symbolized by the term butterfly effect. This is due to the property of chaos that a slight difference in the initial state can lead to a huge difference in the later state. In terms of a discrete dynamical system, if we have two initial values formula_2 and formula_136
No matter how close they are, once time n has progressed to a certain extent, each destination formula_10 and formula_138 can vary significantly. For example, use formula_139
If the orbits are calculated using two very similar initial values, 0 = 0.1000000001, the difference grows to macroscopic values that are clearly visible on the graph after about 29 iterations.

This property of chaos, called initial condition sensitivity, can be quantitatively expressed by the Lyapunov exponent. For a one-dimensional map, the Lyapunov exponent λ can be calculated as follows:

\sum _{i=0}^{N-1}\log \left|f^{\prime }(x_{i})\right\vert }&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Here, log means natural logarithm. This λ is the distance between the two orbits (formula_10 and
formula_138).
A positive value of λ indicates that the system is sensitive to initial conditions, while a zero or negative value indicates that the system is not sensitive to initial conditions. When calculating λ of numerically, it can be confirmed λ remains in the range of zero or negative values in the range formula_142, and that λ can take positive values in the range formula_134.

Window, intermittent

Even beyond formula_128, the behavior does not depend simply on the parameter r. Many sophisticated mathematical structures lurk in the chaotic region for formula_134. In this region, chaos does not persist forever; stable periodic orbits reappear. The behavior for formula_146 can be broadly divided into two types:

* Stable periodic point: In this case, the Lyapunov exponent is negative.
* Aperiodic orbits: In this case, the Lyapunov exponent is positive.
The region of stable periodic points that exists for r formula_147 is called a periodic window, or simply a window. If one looks at a chaotic region in an orbital diagram, the region of nonperiodic orbits looks like a cloud of countless points, with the windows being the scattered blanks surrounded by the cloud.

In each window, the cascade of period-doubling bifurcations that occurred before formula_133 occurs again. However, instead of the previous stable periodic orbits of 2 k, new stable periodic orbits such as 3×2 k and 5×2 k are generated. The first window has a period of p, and the windows from which the period-doubling cascade occurs are called windows of period p, etc.. For example, a window of period 3 exists in the region around 3.8284 &lt; a &lt; 3.8415, and within this region the period doublings are: 3, 6, 12, 24, ..., 3×2 k, ...

In the window region, chaos does not disappear but exists in the background. However, this chaos is unstable, so only stable periodic orbits are observed. In the window region, this potential chaos appears before the orbit is attracted from its initial state to a stable periodic orbit. Such chaos is called transient chaos. In this potential presence of chaos, windows differ from the periodic orbits that appeared before a∞.

There are an infinite number of windows in the range a∞ &lt; a &lt; 4. The windows have various periods, and there is a window with a period for every natural number greater than or equal to three. However, each window does not occur exactly once. The larger the value of p, the more often a window with that period occurs. A window with period 3 occurs only once, while a window with period 13 occurs 315 times. When a periodic orbit of 3 occurs in the window with period 3, the Szarkovsky order is completed, and all orbits with all periods have been seen.

If we restrict ourselves to the case where p is a prime number, the number of windows with period p is

}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

This formula was derived for p to be a prime number, but in fact it is possible to calculate with good accuracy the number of stable p- periodic points for non-prime p as well.

The window width (the difference between a where the window begins and a where the window ends) is widest for windows with period 3 and narrows for larger periods. For example, the window width for a window with period 13 is about 3.13 × 10−6. Rough estimates suggest that about 10% of formula_149 is in the window region, with the rest dominated by chaotic orbits.

The change from chaos to a window as r is increased is caused by a tangent bifurcation, where the map curve is tangent to the diagonal of y = x at the moment of bifurcation, and further parameter changes result in two fixed points where the curve and the line intersect. For a window of period p, the iterated map formula_150 exhibits tangent bifurcation, resulting in stable p-periodic orbits. The exact value of the bifurcation point for a window of period 3 is known, and if the value of this bifurcation point r is formula_151, then formula_152. The outline of this bifurcation can be understood by considering the graph of formula_153 (vertical axis formula_154, horizontal axis formula_10).  

When we look at the behavior of formula_10 when r = 3.8282, which is slightly smaller than the branch point formula_151, we can see that in addition to the irregular changes, there is also a behavior that changes periodically with approximately three periods, and these occur alternately. This type of periodic behavior is called a &quot;laminar&quot;, and the irregular behavior is called a burst, in analogy with fluids. There is no regularity in the length of the time periods of the bursts and laminars, and they change irregularly. However, when we observe the behavior at r = 3.828327, which is closer to formula_151, the average length of the laminars is longer and the average length of the bursts is shorter than when r = 3.8282. If we further increase r, the length of the laminars becomes larger and larger, and at formula_151 it changes to a perfect three- period.

The phenomenon in which orderly motions called laminars and disorderly motions called bursts occur intermittently is called intermittency or intermittent chaos. If we consider the parameter a decreasing from a3, this is a type of emergence of chaos. As the parameter moves away from the window, bursts become more dominant, eventually resulting in a completely chaotic state. This is also a general route to chaos, like the period doubling bifurcation route mentioned above, and routes characterized by the emergence of intermittent chaos due to tangent bifurcations are called intermittency routes.

The mechanism of intermittency can also be understood from the graph of the map. When formula_160 is slightly smaller than formula_151, there is a very small gap between the graph of formula_153 and the diagonal. This gap is called a channel, and many iterations of the map occur as the orbit passes through the narrow channel. During the passage through this channel, formula_10 and formula_164 become very close, and the variables change almost like a periodic three orbit. This corresponds to a laminar. The orbit eventually leaves the narrow channel, but returns to the channel again as a result of the global structure of the map. While leaving the channel, it behaves chaotically. This corresponds to a burst.

Band, window finish

Looking at the entire chaotic domain, whether it is chaotic or windowed, the maximum and minimum values on the vertical axis of the orbital diagram (the upper and lower limits of the attractor) are limited to a certain range. As shown in equation (2-1), the maximum value of the logistic map is given by r/4, which is the upper limit of the attractor. The lower limit of the attractor is given by the point f(r/4) where r/4 is mapped. Ultimately, the maximum and minimum values at which xn moves on the orbital diagram depend on the parameter r

\leq x_{n}\leq {\frac {r}{4}}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
Finally, for r = 4, the orbit spans the entire range [0, 1].

When observing an orbital map, the distribution of points has a characteristic shading. Darker areas indicate that the variable takes on values in the vicinity of the darker areas, whereas lighter areas indicate that the variable takes on values in the vicinity of the darker areas. These differences in the frequency of the points are due to the shape of the graph of the logistic map. The top of the graph, near r/4, attracts orbits with high frequency, and the area near f(r/4) that is mapped from there also becomes highly frequent, and the area near formula_165 that is mapped from there also becomes  highly frequent, and so on. The density distribution of points generated by the map is characterized by a quantity called an invariant measure or distribution function, and the invariant measure of the attractor is reproducible regardless of the initial value.

Looking at the beginning of the chaotic region of the orbit diagram, just beyond the accumulation point formula_166 of the first period - doubling cascade, one can see that the orbit is divided into several subregions. These subregions are called bands. When there are multiple bands, the orbit moves through each band in a regular order, but the values within each band are irregular. Such chaotic orbits are called band chaos or periodic chaos, and chaos with k bands is called k -band chaos. Two-band chaos lies in the range 3.590 &lt; r &lt; 3.675, approximately.

As the value of r is further decreased from the left-hand end of two-band chaos, r = 3.590, the number of bands doubles, just as in the period doubling bifurcation. Let formula_167 (for p = 1, 2, 4, ..., 2k, ...) denote the bifurcation points where p − 1 band chaos splits into p band chaos, or where p band chaos merges into p − 1 band chaos. Then, just as in the period doubling bifurcation, e p accumulates to a value as p → ∞. At this accumulation point formula_168, the number of bands becomes infinite, and the value of formula_168 is equal to the value of formula_128.

Similarly, for the bifurcation points of the period-doubling bifurcation cascade that appeared before a∞, let a p (where p = 1, 2, 4, ..., 2k, ...) denotethe bifurcation points where p stable periodic orbits branch into p + 1 stable periodic orbits. In this case, if we look at the orbital diagram from formula_171 to formula_172, there are two reduced versions of the global orbital diagram from formula_173 to formula_174 in the orbital diagram from formula_171 to formula_172. Similarly, if we look at the orbital diagram from formula_177 to formula_178, there are four reduced versions of the global orbital diagram from a1 to e1 in the orbital diagram from formula_177 to formula_178. Similarly, there are p reduced versions of the global orbital diagram in the orbital diagramfromapto ep, and the branching structure of the logistic map has an infinite self-similar hierarchy.

A self-similar hierarchy of bifurcation structures also exists within windows. The period-doubling bifurcation cascades within a window follow the same path as the cascades of period-2k bifurcations. That is, there are an infinite number of period-doubling bifurcations within a window, after which the behavior becomes chaotic again. For example, in a window of period 3, the cascade of stable periodic orbits ends at formula_181 ≈ 3.8495. After formula_181 ≈ 3.8495, the behavior becomes band chaos of multiples of three. As a increases from formula_181, these band chaos also merge by twos, until at the end of the window there are three bands. Within such bands within a window, there are an infinite number of windows. Ultimately, the window contains a miniature version of the entire orbital diagram for 1 ≤ a ≤ 4, and within the window there exists a self-similar hierarchy of branchings.

At the end of the window, the system reverts to widespread chaos. For a period 3 window, the final 3-band chaos turns into large-area 1-band chaos at a ≈ 3.857, ending the window. However, this change is discontinuous, and the 3-band chaotic attractor suddenly changes size and turns into a 1-band. Such discontinuous changes in attractor size are called crises. Crises of this kind, which occur at the end of a window, are also called internal crises. When a crisis occurs at the end of a window, a stable periodic orbit just touches an unstable periodic point that is not visible on the orbit diagram. This creates an exit point through which the periodic orbits can escape, resulting in an internal crisis. Immediately after the internal crisis, there are periods of widespread chaos, and periods of time when the original band chaotic behavior reoccurs, resulting in a kind of intermittency similar to that observed at the beginning of a window.

==== When r = 4 ====
When the parameter r = 4, the behavior becomes chaotic over the entire range [0, 1]. At this time, the Lyapunov exponent λ is maximized, and the state is the most chaotic. The value of λ for the logistic map at r = 4 can be calculated precisely, and its value is λ = log 2. Although a strict mathematical definition of chaos has not yet been unified, it can be shown that the logistic map with r = 4 is chaotic on [0, 1] according to one well-known definition of chaos.

The invariant measure of the density of points, ρ(x), can also be given by the exact function ρ(x) for r = 4:

}}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Here, ρ(x) means that the fraction of points xn that fall in the infinitesimal interval [x,x+dx] when the map is iterated is given by ρ(x) dx. The frequency distribution of the logistic map with r = 4 has high density near both sides of [0, 1] and is least dense at x = 0.5.

When r = 4, apart from chaotic orbits, there are also periodic orbits with any period. For a natural number n, the graph of formula_184 is a curve with formula_185 peaks and formula_186 valleys, all of whichare tangent to 0 and 1. Thus, the number of intersections between the diagonal and the graph is formula_187, and there are formula_187 fixed points of formula_189. The n-periodic points are always included in these formula_187 fixed points, so any n-periodic orbit exists for formula_191. Thus,when r = 4, there are an infinite number of periodic points on [0, 1], but all of these periodic points are unstable. Furthermore,the uncountably infinite set in the interval [0, 1], the number of periodic pointsis countably infinite, and so almost all orbits starting from initial values are not periodic but non-periodic. 

One of the important aspects of chaos is its dual nature: deterministic and stochastic. Dynamical systems are deterministic processes, but when the range of variables is appropriately coarse-grained, they become indistinguishable from stochastic processes. In the case of the logistic map with r = 4, the outcome of every coin toss can be described by the trajectory of the logistic map. This can be elaborated as follows.

Assume that a coin is tossed with a probability of 1/2 landing on heads or tails, and the coin is tossed repeatedly. If heads is 0 and tails is 1, then the result of heads, tails, heads, tails, etc. will be a symbol string such as 01001... On the other hand, for the trajectory formula_192 of the logistic map, values less than x = 0.5 are converted to 0 and values greater than x = 0.5 are converted to 1, and the trajectory is replaced with a symbol string consisting of 0s and 1s. For example, if the initial value is formula_193, then formula_194, formula_195, formula_196, ..., so the trajectory will be the symbol string 0110... Let formula_197 be the symbol string resulting from the former coin toss, and formula_198 be the symbol string resulting from the latter logistic map. The symbols in the symbol string formula_197 were determined by random coin tossing, so any number sequence patterns are possible. So, whatever the string formula_198 of the logistic map, there is an identical one in formula_197. And, what is &quot;remarkable&quot; is that the converse is also true: whatever the string of formula_197, it can be realized by a logistic map trajectory formula_198 by choosing the appropriate initial values. That is, for any formula_197, there exists a unique point formula_2 in [0, 1] such that formula_206.
==== When r &gt; 4 ====
When the parameter r exceeds 4, the vertex r /4 of the logistic map graph exceeds 1. To the extent that the graph penetrates 1, trajectories can escape [0, 1].

The bifurcation at r = 4 is also a type of crisis, specifically a boundary crisis. In this case, the attractor at [0, 1] becomes unstable and collapses, and since there is no attractor outside it, the trajectory diverges to infinity.

On the other hand, there are orbits that remain in [0, 1] even if r &gt; 4. Easy-to-understand examples are fixed points and periodic points in [0, 1], which remain in [0, 1]. However, there are also orbits that remain in [0, 1] other than fixed points and periodic points.

Let formula_207 be the interval of x such that f  (x) &gt; 1. As mentioned above,once a variable formula_10 enters formula_207, it diverges to minus infinity. There is also formula_210 x in [0, 1] that maps to formula_207 after one application of the map. This interval of x is divided into two, which are collectively called formula_212. Similarly, there are four intervals that map to formula_212 after one application of the map, which are collectively called formula_214. Similarly,there are 2n intervals formula_215 that reach formula_207 after n iterations. Therefore, the interval formula_217 obtained by removing formula_215 from [0, 1] an infinite number of times as follows is a collection of orbits that remain in I.

&lt;/math&gt;|}}

The process of removing formula_215 from [0, 1] is similar to the construction of the Cantor set mentioned above, and in fact Λ exists in [0, 1] as a Cantor set (a closed, completely disconnected, and complete subset of [0, 1]). Furthermore, on formula_217, the logistic map formula_221 is chaotic.

==== When r &lt; 0 ====

Since the logistic map has been often studied as an ecological model, the case where the parameter r is negative has rarely been discussed. As a decreases from 0, when −1 &lt; r &lt; 0, the map asymptotically approaches a stable fixed point of xf = 0, but when a exceeds −1, it bifurcates into two periodic points, and as in the case of positive values, it passes through a period doubling bifurcation and reaches chaos. Finally, when a falls below −2, the map diverges to plus infinity.

==== Exact solutions for special cases ====
For a logistic map with a specific parameter a, an exact solution that explicitly includes the time n and the initial value x 0 has been obtained as follows.

==Chaos and the logistic map==

The relative simplicity of the logistic map makes it a widely used point of entry into a consideration of the concept of chaos. A rough description of chaos is that chaotic systems exhibits: 
* Great Sensitivity on initial conditions: i.e. for a small or infinitesimal variation in the initial conditions you may have a large finite effect.
* Topologically transitive: i.e. the system tends to occupy all available states in a similar sense to fluid mixing.
* The system exhibits dense periodic orbits

These are properties of the logistic map for most values of between about 3.57 and 4 (as noted above). A common source of such sensitivity to initial conditions is that the map represents a repeated folding and stretching of the space on which it is defined. In the case of the logistic map, the quadratic difference equation describing it may be thought of as a stretching-and-folding operation on the interval .

The following figure illustrates the stretching and folding over a sequence of iterates of the map. Figure (a), left, shows a two-dimensional Poincaré plot of the logistic map&#x27;s state space for , and clearly shows the quadratic curve of the difference equation (). However, we can embed the same sequence in a three-dimensional state space, in order to investigate the deeper structure of the map. Figure (b), right, demonstrates this, showing how initially nearby points begin to diverge, particularly in those regions of corresponding to the steeper sections of the plot.
This stretching-and-folding does not just produce a gradual divergence of the sequences of iterates, but an exponential divergence (see Lyapunov exponents), evidenced also by the complexity and unpredictability of the chaotic logistic map. In fact, exponential divergence of sequences of iterates explains the connection between chaos and unpredictability: a small error in the supposed initial state of the system will tend to correspond to a large error later in its evolution. Hence, predictions about future states become progressively (indeed, exponentially) worse when there are even very small errors in our knowledge of the initial state. This quality of unpredictability and apparent randomness led the logistic map equation to be used as a pseudo-random number generator in early computers.

At r = 2, the function formula_222 intersects formula_223 precisely at the maximum point, so convergence to the equilibrium point is on the order of formula_224. Consequently, the equilibrium point is called &quot;superstable&quot;. Its Lyapunov exponent is formula_225. A similar argument shows that there is a superstable formula_160 value within each interval where the dynamical system has a stable cycle. This can be seen in the Lyapunov exponent plot as sharp dips.

Since the map is confined to an interval on the real number line, its dimension is less than or equal to unity. Numerical estimates yield a correlation dimension of (Grassberger, 1983), a Hausdorff dimension of about 0.538 (Grassberger 1981), and an information dimension of approximately 0.5170976 (Grassberger 1983) for (onset of chaos). Note: It can be shown that the correlation dimension is certainly between 0.4926 and 0.5024.

It is often possible, however, to make precise and accurate statements about the &quot;likelihood&quot; of a future state in a chaotic system. If a (possibly chaotic) dynamical system has an attractor, then there exists a probability measure that gives the long-run proportion of time spent by the system in the various regions of the attractor. In the case of the logistic map with parameter and an initial state in , the attractor is also the interval and the probability measure corresponds to the beta distribution with parameters and . Specifically, the invariant measure is

:formula_227

Unpredictability is not randomness, but in some circumstances looks very much like it. Hence, and fortunately, even if we know very little about the initial state of the logistic map (or some other chaotic system), we can still say something about the distribution of states arbitrarily far into the future, and use this knowledge to inform decisions based on the state of the system.
=== Graphical representation ===
The bifurcation diagram for the logistic map can be visualized with the following Python code:

=== Special cases of the map ===

====Upper bound when ====
Although exact solutions to the recurrence relation are only available in a small number of cases, a closed-form upper bound on the logistic map is known when . There are two aspects of the behavior of the logistic map that should be captured by an upper bound in this regime: the asymptotic geometric decay with constant , and the fast initial decay when is close to 1, driven by the term in the recurrence relation. The following bound captures both of these effects:

:formula_228

====Solution when ====
The special case of can in fact be solved exactly, as can the case with ; however, the general case can only be predicted statistically. 
The solution when is,

:formula_229

where the initial condition parameter is given by

:formula_230

For rational , after a finite number of iterations maps into a periodic sequence. But almost all are irrational, and, for irrational , never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions, while the squared sine function keeps folded within the range .

For an equivalent solution in terms of complex numbers instead of trigonometric functions is

:formula_231

where is either of the complex numbers

:formula_232

with modulus equal to 1. Just as the squared sine function in the trigonometric solution leads to neither shrinkage nor expansion of the set of points visited, in the latter solution this effect is accomplished by the unit modulus of .

By contrast, the solution when is

:formula_233

for . Since for any value of other than the unstable fixed point 0, the term goes to 0 as goes to infinity, so goes to the stable fixed point .

====Finding cycles of any length when ====
For the case, from almost all initial conditions the iterate sequence is chaotic. Nevertheless, there exist an infinite number of initial conditions that lead to cycles, and indeed there exist cycles of length for &quot;all&quot; integers . We can exploit the relationship of the logistic map to the dyadic transformation (also known as the &quot;bit-shift map&quot;) to find cycles of any length. If follows the logistic map and follows the &quot;dyadic transformation&quot;

:formula_234

then the two are related by a homeomorphism

:formula_235

The reason that the dyadic transformation is also called the bit-shift map is that when is written in binary notation, the map moves the binary point one place to the right (and if the bit to the left of the binary point has become a &quot;1&quot;, this &quot;1&quot; is changed to a &quot;0&quot;). A cycle of length 3, for example, occurs if an iterate has a 3-bit repeating sequence in its binary expansion (which is not also a one-bit repeating sequence): 001, 010, 100, 110, 101, or 011. The iterate 001001001... maps into 010010010..., which maps into 100100100..., which in turn maps into the original 001001001...; so this is a 3-cycle of the bit shift map. And the other three binary-expansion repeating sequences give the 3-cycle 110110110... → 101101101... → 011011011... → 110110110... Either of these 3-cycles can be converted to fraction form: for example, the first-given 3-cycle can be written as → → → . Using the above translation from the bit-shift map to the formula_236 logistic map gives the corresponding logistic cycle 0.611260467... → 0.950484434... → 0.188255099... → 0.611260467... We could similarly translate the other bit-shift 3-cycle into its corresponding logistic cycle. Likewise, cycles of any length can be found in the bit-shift map and then translated into the corresponding logistic cycles.

However, since almost all numbers in are irrational, almost all initial conditions of the bit-shift map lead to the non-periodicity of chaos. This is one way to see that the logistic map is chaotic for almost all initial conditions.

The number of cycles of (minimal) length for the logistic map with (tent map with ) is a known integer sequence : 2, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 30, 56, 99, 186, 335, 630, 1161... This tells us that the logistic map with has 2 fixed points, 1 cycle of length 2, 2 cycles of length 3 and so on. This sequence takes a particularly simple form for prime : . For example: 2 ⋅  = 630 is the number of cycles of length 13. Since this case of the logistic map is chaotic for almost all initial conditions, all of these finite-length cycles are unstable.

The bifurcation pattern shown above for the logistic map is not limited to the logistic map . It appears in a number of maps that satisfy certain conditions . The following dynamical system using sine functions is one example :

&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Here, the domain is 0 ≤ b ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 . The sine map ( 4-1 ) exhibits qualitatively identical behavior to the logistic map ( 1-2 ) : like the logistic map, it also becomes chaotic via a period doubling route as the parameter b increases, and moreover, like the logistic map, it also exhibits a window in the chaotic region .

Both the logistic map and the sine map are one-dimensional maps that map the interval [0, 1] to [0, 1] and satisfy the following property, called unimodal .

formula_237.
The map is differentiable and there exists a unique critical point c in [0, 1] such that formula_238.
In general, if a one-dimensional map with one parameter and one variable is unimodal and the vertex can be approximated by a second-order polynomial, then, regardless of the specific form of the map, an infinite period-doubling cascade of bifurcations will occur for the parameter range 3 ≤ r ≤ 3.56994... , and the ratio δ defined by equation ( 3-13 ) is equal to the Feigenbaum constant, 4.669... .

The pattern of stable periodic orbits that emerge from the logistic map is also universal . For a unimodal map, formula_239 , with parameter c, stable periodic orbits with various periods continue to emerge in a parameter interval where the two fixed points are unstable, and the pattern of their emergence (the number of stable periodic orbits with a certain period and the order of their appearance) is known to be common . In other words, for this type of map, the sequence of stable periodic orbits is the same regardless of the specific form of the map . For the logistic map, the parameter interval is 3 &lt; a &lt; 4, but for the sine map ( 4-1 ), the parameter interval for the common sequence of stable periodic orbits is 0.71... &lt; b &lt; 1 . This universal sequence of stable periodic orbits is called the U sequence .

In addition, the logistic map has the property that its Schwartzian derivative is always negative on the interval [0, 1] . The Schwartzian derivative of a map f (of class C3 ) is 

-{\frac {3}{2}}\left({\frac {f&quot;(x)}{f&#x27;(x)}}\right)^{2}} &lt;/math&gt;|}}
In fact, when we calculate the Schwarzian derivative of the logistic map, we get

}&lt;0}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the Schwartzian derivative is negative regardless of the values of a and x . It is known that if a one-dimensional mapping from [0, 1] to [0, 1] is unimodal and has a negative Schwartzian derivative, then there is at most one stable periodic orbit . 

=== Topological conjugate mapping ===

Let the symbol ∘ denote the composition of maps . In general, for  a topological space X, Y, two maps f  : X → X and g  : Y → Y are composed by a homeomorphism h : X → Y.

f and g are said to be phase conjugates if they satisfy the relation . The concept of phase conjugation plays an important role in the study of dynamical systems . Phase conjugate f and g exhibit essentially identical behavior, and if the behavior of f is periodic, then g is also periodic, and if the behavior of f is chaotic, then g is also chaotic .

In particular, if a homeomorphism h is linear, then f and g are said to be linearly conjugate . Every quadratic function is linearly conjugate with every other quadratic function . Hence,

&lt;/math&gt;|}}

&lt;/math&gt;|}}

are linearly conjugates of the logistic map for any parameter a . Equations ( 4-6 ) and ( 4-7 ) are also called logistic maps . In particular, the form ( 4-7 ) is suitable for time-consuming numerical calculations, since it requires less computational effort .

Moreover, the logistic map formula_240 for formula_236 is topologically conjugate to the following tent map T  ( x ) and Bernoulli shift map B  ( x ) .

\right)\\2(1-x_{n})&amp;\left({\frac {1}{2}}\leq x_{n}\leq 1\right)\end{cases}}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

\right)\\2x_{n}-1&amp;\left({\frac {1}{2}}\leq x_{n}\leq 1\right)\end{cases}}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

These phase conjugate relations can be used to prove that the logistic map formula_240 is strictly chaotic and to derive the exact solution ( 3-19 ) of formula_243 .

Alternatively, introducing the concept of symbolic dynamical systems, consider the following shift map σ defined on the symbolic string space consisting of strings of 0s and 1s as introduced above :

Here, formula_244 is 0 or 1. On the set formula_217 introduced in equation ( 3-18 ), the logistic map formula_246 is topologically conjugate to the shift map, so we can use this to derive that formula_246 on formula_217 is chaotic .

=== Period-doubling route to chaos ===

In the logistic map, we have a function formula_249, and we want to study what happens when we iterate the map many times. The map might fall into a fixed point, a fixed cycle, or chaos. When the map falls into a stable fixed cycle of length formula_250, we would find that the graph of formula_251 and the graph of formula_252 intersects at formula_250 points, and the slope of the graph of formula_251 is bounded in formula_255 at those intersections. 

For example, when formula_256, we have a single intersection, with slope bounded in formula_255, indicating that it is a stable single fixed point.

As formula_160 increases to beyond formula_256, the intersection point splits to two, which is a period doubling. For example, when formula_260, there are three intersection points, with the middle one unstable, and the two others stable.

As formula_160 approaches formula_262, another period-doubling occurs in the same way. The period-doublings occur more and more frequently, until at a certain formula_263, the period doublings become infinite, and the map becomes chaotic. This is the period-doubling route to chaos.


=== Scaling limit ===
Looking at the images, one can notice that at the point of chaos formula_264, the curve of formula_265 looks like a fractal. Furthermore, as we repeat the period-doublingsformula_266, the graphs seem to resemble each other, except that they are shrunken towards the middle, and rotated by 180 degrees. 

This suggests to us a scaling limit: if we repeatedly double the function, then scale it up by formula_267 for a certain constant formula_267:formula_269then at the limit, we would end up with a function formula_270 that satisfies formula_271. This is a Feigenbaum function, which appears in most period-doubling routes to chaos (thus it is an instance of universality). Further, as the period-doubling intervals become shorter and shorter, the ratio between two period-doubling intervals converges to a limit, the first Feigenbaum constant formula_272.
The constant formula_267 can be numerically found by trying many possible values. For the wrong values, the map does not converge to a limit, but when it is formula_274, it converges. This is the second Feigenbaum constant.

=== Chaotic regime ===
In the chaotic regime, formula_275, the limit of the iterates of the map, becomes chaotic dark bands interspersed with non-chaotic bright bands.
=== Other scaling limits ===
When formula_160 approaches formula_277, we have another period-doubling approach to chaos, but this time with periods 3, 6, 12, ... This again has the same Feigenbaum constants formula_278. The limit of formula_279 is also the same Feigenbaum function. This is an example of universality.

We can also consider period-tripling route to chaos by picking a sequence of formula_280 such that formula_210 is the lowest value in the period-formula_282 window of the bifurcation diagram. For example, we have formula_283, with the limit formula_284. This has a different pair of Feigenbaum constants formula_285. And formula_275converges to the fixed point to formula_287As another example, period-4-pling has a pair of Feigenbaum constants distinct from that of period-doubling, even though period-4-pling is reached by two period-doublings. In detail, define formula_280 such that formula_210 is the lowest value in the period-formula_290 window of the bifurcation diagram. Then we have formula_291, with the limit formula_292. This has a different pair of Feigenbaum constants formula_293. 

In general, each period-multiplying route to chaos has its own pair of Feigenbaum constants. In fact, there are typically more than one. For example, for period-7-pling, there are at least 9 different pairs of Feigenbaum constants.

Generally, formula_294, and the relation becomes exact as both numbers increase to infinity: formula_295.

===Feigenbaum universality of 1-D maps===
Universality of one-dimensional maps with parabolic maxima and Feigenbaum constants formula_296, formula_297.

The gradual increase of formula_298 at interval formula_299 changes dynamics from regular to chaotic one with qualitatively the same bifurcation diagram as those for logistic map.

=== Renormalization estimate ===
The Feigenbaum constants can be estimated by a renormalization argument. (Section 10.7,).

By universality, we can use another family of functions that also undergoes repeated period-doubling on its route to chaos, and even though it is not exactly the logistic map, it would still yield the same Feigenbaum constants.

Define the family formula_300The family has an equilibrium point at zero, and as formula_160 increases, it undergoes period-doubling bifurcation at formula_302.

The first bifurcation occurs at formula_303. After the period-doubling bifurcation, we can solve for the period-2 stable orbit by formula_304, which yields formula_305At some point formula_306, the period-2 stable orbit undergoes period-doubling bifurcation again, yielding a period-4 stable orbit. In order to find out what the stable orbit is like, we &quot;zoom in&quot; around the region of formula_307, using the affine transform formula_308. Now, by routine algebra, we haveformula_309where formula_310. At approximately formula_311, the second bifurcation occurs, thus formula_312.

By self-similarity, the third bifurcation when formula_313, and so on. Thus we have formula_314, or formula_315. Iterating this map, we find formula_316, and formula_317.

Thus, we have the estimates formula_318, and formula_319. These are within 10% of the true values.

== Relation to logistic ordinary differential equation ==

The logistic map exhibits numerous characteristics of both periodic and chaotic solutions, whereas the logistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) exhibits regular solutions, commonly referred to as the S-shaped sigmoid function. The logistic map can be seen as the discrete counterpart of the logistic ODE, and their correlation has been extensively discussed in literature
== The logistic map as a model of biological populations ==
=== Discrete Population Model ===
The logistic map originated from the research of British mathematical biologist Robert May and became widely known as a formula for considering changes in populations of organisms. In such a logistic map for organism populations, the variable formula_10 represents the number of organisms living in a certain environment (more technically, the population size). Furthermore, it is assumed that no organisms leave the environment and no external organisms enter the environment (or that there is no substantial impact even if there is immigration), and the mathematical model for considering the increase or decrease in population in such a situation is the logistic map in mathematical biology . 

There are two types of mathematical models for the growth of populations of organisms: discrete-time models using difference equations and continuous-time models using differential equations . For example, in the case of a type of insect that dies soon after laying eggs, the population of the insect is counted for each generation, i.e., the number of individuals in the first generation, the number of individuals in the second generation, and so on . Such examples fit the former discrete-time model . On the other hand, when the generations are continuously overlapping, it is compatible with the continuous-time model . The logistic map corresponds to such a discrete or generation-separated population model . 

Let N denote the number of individuals of a single species in an environment . The simplest model for population growth is one in which the population continues to grow at a constant rate relative to the number of individuals. This type of population growth model is called the Malthusian model, and can be expressed as follows :

&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Here, N n is the number of individuals in the nth generation, and α is the population growth rate, a positive constant . However, in model ( 5-1 ), the population continues to grow indefinitely, making it an unrealistic model for most real-world phenomena . Since there is a limit to the number of individuals that an environment can support, it seems natural that the growth rate α decreases as the population N n increases . This change in growth rate due to changes in population density is called the density effect . The following difference equation is the simplest improvement model that reflects the density effect in model ( 5-1 ).

&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Here, a is the maximum growth rate possible in the environment, and b is the strength of the influence of density effects . Model ( 5-2 ) assumes that the growth rate declines simply in proportion to the number of individuals . Let N n in equation ( 5-2 ) be

N_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

After performing the variable transformation, the following logistic map is derived :

&lt;/math&gt;|}}

When using equation ( 5-2 ) or equation ( 5-4 ) as the population size of an organism, if Nn or xn becomes negative, it becomes meaningless as a population size . To prevent this, the condition 0 ≤ x0 ≤ 1 for the initial value x0 and the condition 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 for the parameter a are required . 

Alternatively, we can assume a maximum population size K that the environment can support, and use this to

{K}}\right)N_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

The logistic map can be derived by considering a difference equation that incorporates density effects in the form formula_321 , where the variable formula_10 represents the ratio of the number of individuals formula_323 to the maximum number of individuals K .

=== Discretization of the logistic equation ===
The logistic map can also be derived from the discretization of the logistic equation for continuous-time population models . The name of the logistic map comes from Robert May&#x27;s introduction of the logistic map from the discretization of the logistic equation. The logistic equation is an ordinary differential equation that describes the time evolution of a population as follows : 

\ =rN\left(1-{\frac {N}{K}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Here, N is the number or population density of an organism, t is continuous time, and K and r are parameters. K is the carrying capacity, and r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase, which is usually positive . The left-hand side of this equation 
dN/dt
denotes the rate of change of the population size at time t .

The logistic equation ( 5-6 ) appears similar to the logistic map ( 5-4 ), but the behavior of the solutions is quite different from that of the logistic map . As long as the initial value N 0 is positive, the population size N of the logistic equation always converges monotonically to K .

The logistic map can be derived by applying the Euler method, which is a method for numerically solving first-order ordinary differential equations, to this logistic equation . [ Note 2 ] The Euler method uses a time interval (time step size) Δt to approximate the growth rate dN/dt
is approximated as follows :

\approx {\frac {N(t+\Delta t)-N(t)}{\Delta t}}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

This approximation leads to the following logistic map :

where formula_10 and a in this equation are related to the original parameters, variables, and time step size as follows :

N(n\Delta t)}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

If Δt is small enough, equation ( 5-8 ) serves as a valid approximation to the original equation ( 5-6 ), and coincides with the solution of the original equation as Δt → 0 . On the other hand, as Δt becomes large, the solution deviates from the original solution . Furthermore, due to the relationship in equation ( 5-10 ), increasing Δt is equivalent to increasing the parameter a . Thus, increasing Δt not only increases the error from the original equation but also produces chaotic behavior in the solution .

=== Positioning ===
As described above, in biological population dynamics, the logistic map is one of the models of discrete growth processes. However, unlike the laws of physics, the logistic map as a model of biological population size is not derived from direct experimental results or universally valid principles . Although there is some rationality in the way it is derived, it is essentially a &quot;model&quot; thought up in one&#x27;s mind . May, who made the logistic map famous, did not claim that the model he was discussing accurately represented the increase and decrease in population size . Historically, continuous-time models based on differential equations have been widely used in the study of biological population dynamics, and the application of these continuous-time models has deepened our understanding of biological population dynamics . As a discrete-time population model that takes into account density effects, the Ricker model, in which the population size is not negative, is more realistic .

Generally speaking, mathematical models can provide important qualitative information about population dynamics, but their results should not be taken too seriously without experimental support . Even if the conclusions of mathematical models deviate from those of biological studies, mathematical modeling is still useful because it can provide a useful control. Biological issues may be raised by reviewing the model construction process and settings, or the biological knowledge and assumptions that the model is based on. Although the logistic map is too simple to be realistic as a population model, its results suggest that a variety of population fluctuations may occur due to the dynamics inherent in the population itself, regardless of random influences from the environment. 
== Applications ==
===Coupled Map System===
The degree of freedom or dimension of a one-variable logistic map as a system is one . On the other hand, in the real natural world, it is thought that there are many chaotic systems with many degrees of freedom, not only in time but also in space . Alternatively, the synchronization phenomenon of oscillators performing chaotic motion is also a research subject . To investigate such things, there is a method of coupled maps that couples many difference equations (maps) . The logistic map is often used as a subject of coupled map model research . The reason for this is that the logistic map itself has already been well investigated as a typical model of chaos, and there is an accumulation of research on it .

There are various methods for the specific coupling in the coupled map model . Suppose a total of N maps are coupled, and the state of the i-th map at time n is represented by formula_325 . In a method called globally coupled maps, formula_326 is formulated as follows :

\sum _{j=1}^{N}f(x_{n}(j))}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

In the current field of coupled oscillators, the simplest model is the following, in which two oscillators, x and y, are coupled by a difference in variables : 

}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

In these equations, f( x ) is the specific map to incorporate into the coupled map model, and applies here if the logistic map is used .
In equations ( 6-1 ) and ( 6-2 ), ε and D are parameters called coupling coefficients, which indicate the strength of the coupling between the maps . On the other hand, when the logistic map is incorporated into a coupled map model, the parameter a of the logistic map indicates the strength of the nonlinearity of the model . By changing the value of a and the value of ε or D, various phenomena appear in the coupled map system of logistic maps. For example, in model ( 6-2 ), when D is increased to a value Dc or more, x and y oscillate chaotically while synchronously . Even below Dc, not only do chaotic oscillations occur in a continuous manner . When D is in a certain range, x and y oscillate with two periods even though r = 4 . When a = 3.8, behavior in which synchronous and asynchronous states alternate continuously is also observed .

In a study of the application of the logistic map to a globally coupled map with a large degree of freedom ( 6-1 ), a phenomenon called chaotic itinerancy was found . This is a phenomenon in which the orbit traverses a region in phase space that is said to be the remains of an attractor, repeating the cycle from an orderly state in which several clusters oscillate together to a disordered state, then to another cluster state, then back to the disordered state again, and so on . 

===Pseudorandom number generator===
In the fields of computer simulation and information security, the creation of pseudorandom numbers using a computer is an important technique, and one of the methods for generating pseudorandom numbers is the use of chaos. Although a pseudorandom number generator based on chaos with sufficient performance has not yet been realized, several methods have been proposed. Several researchers have also investigated the possibility of creating a pseudorandom number generator based on chaos for the logistic map. 

Parameter r = 4 is often used for pseudorandom number generation using the logistic map . Historically, as described below, in 1947, shortly after the birth of electronic computers, Stanisław Ulam and John von Neumann also pointed out the possibility of a pseudorandom number generator using the logistic map with r = 4 . However, the distribution of points for the logistic map formula_327 is as shown in equation ( 3-17 ), and the numbers that are generated are biased toward 0 and 1 . Therefore, some processing is required to obtain unbiased uniform random numbers . Methods for doing so include:

A method for converting the obtained values to a uniform distribution using the tent map ( 4-8 ) 
The resulting number is converted to either 0 or 1 using a threshold, as in the coin tossing analogy above, and this process is repeated to obtain a uniformly random bit string .
In addition, the sequences formula_10 and formula_329 obtained by the logistic map are strongly correlated, which makes it problematic for pseudorandom sequences . One way to solve this is to generate the sequence formula_330 for each iteration of the map, rather than generating the sequence formula_331 for some number of iterations τ &gt; 1 . For example, it is said that good pseudorandom numbers can be obtained for method 1 with τ &gt; 10 or τ &gt; 13 , and for method 2 with τ &gt; 16 .

A common problem with digitally calculating chaos using a computer is that, because a computer has a finite calculation precision, it is in principle impossible to obtain a truly aperiodic sequence, which is the nature of chaos, and instead outputs a finite periodic sequence . Even if aperiodic sequences cannot be obtained in principle, sequences with as long a period as possible are desirable for generating pseudorandom numbers . However, when the periodicity of the sequence actually output by the logistic map formula_243 in single-precision floating-point calculations was investigated, it was reported that the period of the sequence actually output is much smaller than the maximum period possible from the number of bits allocated, and from this point of view, it has been pointed out that pseudorandom number generation by the logistic map is inferior to existing pseudorandom number generators such as the Mersenne Twister . In addition, with the logistic map formula_243 , there is a risk that the value will fall to the fixed point 0 during the calculation and remain constant . On the other hand, the logistic map always takes values in the open interval (0, 1), so it can be calculated without problems not only with floating point but also with fixed point, and can enjoy the advantages of fixed point arithmetic . It has been pointed out that fixed point has a longer period than floating point for the same number of bits, and that unintended convergence to 0 can be eliminated .

=== Extension to complex numbers ===
Dynamical systems defined by complex analytic functions are also of interest . An example is the dynamical system defined by the quadratic function :

where the parameter c and the variable z are complex numbers . This map is essentially the same as the logistic map ( 1-2 ) . As mentioned above, the map ( 6-3 ) is topologically conjugate to the logistic map ( 1-2 ) through a linear function .

When the iteration of the map ( 6-3 ) is calculated with a fixed parameter c and varying the initial value formula_334, a set of formula_334 such that formula_336 does not diverge to infinity as n → ∞ is called a filled Julia set . Furthermore, the boundary of a filled Julia set is called a Julia set . When the iteration of the map ( 6-3 ) is calculated with a fixed initial value formula_337 and varying the parameter c, a set of c such that z does not diverge to infinity is called a Mandelbrot set . The Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets of the map ( 6-3 ) generate fractal figures that are described as &quot;mystical looking&quot; and &quot;extremely mysterious&quot; . 

In particular, in the Mandelbrot set, each disk in the diagram corresponds to a region of asymptotically stable periodic orbits of a certain period. By juxtaposing the logistic map orbit diagram with the Mandelbrot set diagram, it is possible to see that the asymptotically stable fixed points, period doubling bifurcations, and period-three windows of the logistic map orbit diagram correspond on the real axis to the Mandelbrot set diagram . 

=== When there is a time delay ===

f we interpret the logistic map as a model of the population of each generation of organisms, it is possible that the population of the next generation will affect not only the population of the current generation, but also the population of the generation before that. An example of such a case is

where the number of individuals in the previous generation, formula_338, is included in the equation as a negative density effect . If formula_339, then equation ( 6-4 ) can be replaced by the following two-variable difference equation .

}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

This dynamical system is used to study bifurcation of quasi-periodic attractors and is called the delayed logistic map . The delayed logistic map exhibits a Neimark–Sakher bifurcation at r = 2, where the asymptotically stable fixed point becomes unstable and an asymptotically stable invariant curve forms around the unstable fixed point .

== Research history ==
===Before Chaos was named===
Before the iteration of maps became relevant to dynamical systems, mathematicians Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou studied the iteration of complex functions . Julia and Fatou&#x27;s work was broad, focusing on analytic functions. In particular, they studied the behavior of the following complex quadratic function, also shown in equation ( 6-3 ), in the 1920s . 

Julia and Fatu also recognized chaotic behavior in Julia sets, but because there was no computer graphics at the time, no one followed suit and their research stalled. Research on complex dynamical systems then declined until the late 1970s, and it was not until the appearance of Benoit Mandelbrot and others that the rich dynamical behavior exhibited by maps on the complex plane was noticed. 
In 1947, mathematicians Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann wrote a short paper entitled &quot;On combination of stochastic and deterministic processes&quot; in which they

They pointed out that pseudorandom numbers can be generated by the repeated composition of quadratic functions such as . In modern terms, this equation corresponds to the logistic map with r = 4 . At that time, the word &quot;chaos&quot; had not yet been used, but Ulam and von Neumann were already paying attention to the generation of complex sequences using nonlinear functions . In their report, Ulam and von Neumann also clarified that the map ( 7-2 ) and the tent map are topologically conjugate, and that the invariant measure of the sequence of this map is given by equation ( 3-17 ) .

There have since been some detailed investigations of quadratic maps of the form with arbitrary parameter a . Between 1958 and 1963, Finnish mathematician Pekka Mylberg developed the

This line of research is essential for dynamical systems, and Mühlberg has also investigated the period-doubling branching cascades of this map, showing the existence of an accumulation point λ = 1.401155189...[352 ] . Others, such as the work of the Soviet Oleksandr Sharkovsky in 1964, the French Igor Gumowski and Christian Mila in 1969, and Nicholas Metropolis in 1973, have revealed anomalous behavior of simple one-variable difference equations such as the logistic map. 

===Robert May&#x27;s research===

Later, in the early 1970s, mathematical biologist Robert May encountered the model of equation ( 1-2 ) while working on an ecological problem. May introduced equation ( 1-2 ), i.e., the logistic map, by discretizing the logistic equation in time. He mathematically analyzed the behavior of the logistic map, and published his results in 1973 and 1974. Numerical experiments were performed on the logistic map to investigate the change in its behavior depending on the parameter r. In 1976, he published a paper in Nature entitled &quot;Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics &quot;. 

The 1976 paper was a review paper that focused on the logistic map and emphasized and drew attention to the fact that even simple nonlinear functions can produce extremely complex behaviors such as period-doubling bifurcation cascades and chaos. This paper in particular caused a great stir and was accepted by the scientific community due to May&#x27;s status as a mathematical biologist, the clarity of his research results, and above all, the shocking content that a simple parabolic equation can produce surprisingly complex behavior. Through May&#x27;s research, the logistic map attracted many researchers to chaos research and became such a famous mathematical model that it is said to have restarted the flow of chaos research . 

===After May&#x27;s research===
May also drew attention to the paper by using the term &quot;chaos&quot;, which was used by Tien-Yen Li and James York in their paper &quot;Period three implies chaos&quot;. Although some disagree, Li and York&#x27;s paper is considered the first to use the word &quot;chaos&quot; as a mathematical term, and is credited with coining the term &quot;chaos&quot; to refer to deterministic, chaotic behavior. Li and York completed the paper in 1973, but when they submitted it to The American Mathematical Monthly, they were told that it was too technical and that it should be significantly rewritten to make it easier to understand, and it was rejected . The paper was then left unrevised . However, the following year, in 1974, May came to give a special guest lecture at the University of Maryland where Lee and York were working, and talked about the logistic map . At the time, May did not yet understand what was happening in the chaotic domain of the logistic map, but Lee and York were also unaware of the period-doubling cascade of the logistic map . Excited by May&#x27;s talk, Lee and York caught up with May after the lecture and told him about their results, which surprised May. Lee and York quickly rewrote the rejected paper, and the resubmitted paper was published in 1975. 

Also, around 1975, mathematical physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum noticed a scaling law in which the branching values converged in a geometric progression when he looked at the period-doubling cascade of the logistic map, and discovered the existence of a constant, now called the Feigenbaum constant, through numerical experiments. May and George Oster had also noticed the scaling law, but they were unable to follow it in depth . Feigenbaum discovered that the same constant also appeared in the sine map shown in equation ( 4-1 ), and realized that this scaling law had a universality that went beyond the logistic map . In 1980, a rigorous proof of this result was given by Pierre Collé , Jean-Pierre Eckman, Oscar Rumford, and others . At about the same time as Feigenbaum, or later, physicists discovered the same period doubling cascade and the Feigenbaum constant in real life, and chaos, which had previously been seen as a strictly mathematical phenomenon, had a major impact on the field of physics as well. 

However, there is criticism of the tendency to downplay research results from before the popularity of chaos, and to attribute many of those results to rediscoverers who used the logistic map, etc. . May himself respects the existence of previous research, but positions his own achievement as not being &quot;the first to independently discover the strange mathematical behavior of quadratic maps,&quot; but as being one of the &quot;last researchers to emphasize their broad implications in science.&quot; Mathematician Robert Devaney states the following before explaining the logistic map in his book : 

This means that by simply iterating the quadratic function formula_340 (also known as the logistic map), we can predict the fate of the initial population formula_2. This sounds simple, but I dare to point out that it was only in the late 1990s, after the efforts of hundreds of mathematicians, that the iteration of this simple quadratic function was fully understood.

<text>The Levant ( ) is the subregion that borders the Eastern Mediterranean sea to the west and core West Asia, or by the political term, &quot;Middle East&quot;, to the east. In its narrowest sense, which is in use today in archaeology and other cultural contexts, it is equivalent to Cyprus and a stretch of land bordering the Mediterranean Sea in western Asia: i.e. the historical region of Syria (&quot;Greater Syria&quot;), which includes present-day Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Palestinian territories and the Northern Syrian Regions. Its overwhelming characteristic is that it represents the land bridge between Africa and Eurasia. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the Eastern Mediterranean with its islands; that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece in Southern Europe to Egypt and Cyrenaica (Eastern Libya) in Northern Africa.

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the term &quot;levante&quot; was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean, including Greece, Anatolia, Syria-Palestine, and Egypt, that is, the lands east of Venice. Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of Syria-Palestine and Egypt. The term entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian , meaning &quot;rising&quot;, implying the rising of the Sun in the east, and is broadly equivalent to the term &quot;al-Mashriq&quot; (, ), meaning &quot;the eastern place, where the Sun rises&quot;.

In 1581, England set up the Levant Company to trade with the Ottoman Empire. The name &quot;Levant States&quot; was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I. This is probably the reason why the term &quot;Levant&quot; has come to be used more specifically to refer to modern Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and the island of Cyprus. Some scholars mistakenly believed that it derives from the name of Lebanon. Today the term is often used in conjunction with prehistoric or ancient historical references.

Another term for &quot;Syria-Palestine&quot; is &quot;Ash-Shaam&quot; (, ), the area that is bounded by the Taurus Mountains of Turkey in the north, the Mediterranean Sea in the west, the north Arabian Desert and Mesopotamia in the east, and Sinai in the south (which can be fully included or not). Typically, it does not include Anatolia (also known as Asia Minor), the Caucasus Mountains, or any part of the Arabian Peninsula proper. Cilicia (in Asia Minor) and the Sinai Peninsula (Asian Egypt) are sometimes included.

As a name for the contemporary region, several dictionaries consider &quot;Levant&quot; to be archaic today. Both the noun &quot;Levant&quot; and the adjective &quot;Levantine&quot; are now commonly used to describe the ancient and modern culture area formerly called Syro-Palestinian or Biblical: archaeologists now speak of the Levant and of Levantine archaeology, food scholars speak of Levantine cuisine, and the Latin Christians of the Levant continue to be called Levantine Christians.

The Levant has been described as the &quot;crossroads of Western Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Northeast Africa&quot;, and in geological (tectonic) terms as the &quot;northwest of the Arabian Plate&quot;. The populations of the Levant share not only geographic position, but cuisine, customs, and history. They are often referred to as &quot;Levantines&quot;.

==Etymology==


The term &quot;Levant&quot; appears in English in 1497, and originally meant &#x27;the East&#x27; or &#x27;Mediterranean lands east of Italy&#x27;. It is borrowed from the French &#x27;rising&#x27;, referring to the rising of the sun in the east, or the point where the sun rises. The phrase is ultimately from the Latin word , meaning &#x27;lift, raise&#x27;. Similar etymologies are found in Greek &quot;Anatolē&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Anatolia &#x27;the direction of sunrise&#x27;), in Germanic &quot;Morgenland&quot; (), in Italian (as in &quot;Riviera di Levante&quot;, the portion of the Liguria coast east of Genoa), in Hungarian &quot;Kelet&quot; (&#x27;east&#x27;), in Spanish and Catalan &quot;Levante&quot; and &quot;Llevant&quot;, (&#x27;the place of rising&#x27;), and in Hebrew &quot;mizraḥ&quot; (&#x27;east&#x27;). Most notably, &quot;Orient&quot; and its Latin source &quot;oriens&quot; meaning &#x27;east&#x27;, is literally &quot;rising&quot;, deriving from Latin &quot;orior&quot; &#x27;rise&#x27;.

The notion of the Levant has undergone a dynamic process of historical evolution in usage, meaning, and understanding. While the term &quot;Levantine&quot; originally referred to the European residents of the eastern Mediterranean region, it later came to refer to regional &quot;native&quot; and &quot;minority&quot; groups.

The term became current in English in the 16th century, along with the first English merchant adventurers in the region; English ships appeared in the Mediterranean in the 1570s, and the English merchant company signed its agreement (&quot;capitulations&quot;) with the Ottoman Sultan in 1579. The English Levant Company was founded in 1581 to trade with the Ottoman Empire, and in 1670 the French was founded for the same purpose. At this time, the Far East was known as the &quot;Upper Levant&quot;.
In early 19th-century travel writing, the term sometimes incorporated certain Mediterranean provinces of the Ottoman Empire, as well as independent Greece (and especially the Greek islands). In 19th-century archaeology, it referred to overlapping cultures in this region during and after prehistoric times, intending to reference the place instead of any one culture. The French mandate of Syria and Lebanon (1920–1946) was called the Levant states.

==Geography and modern-day use of the term==
Today, &quot;Levant&quot; is the term typically used by archaeologists and historians with reference to the history of the region. Scholars have adopted the term Levant to identify the region due to its being a &quot;wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus&quot; that does not have the &quot;political overtones&quot; of Syria-Palestine. The term is also used for modern events, peoples, states or parts of states in the same region, namely Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey are sometimes considered Levant countries (compare with Near East, Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean and West Asia). Several researchers include the island of Cyprus in Levantine studies, including the Council for British Research in the Levant, the UCLA Near Eastern Languages and Cultures department, &quot;Journal of Levantine Studies&quot; and the UCL Institute of Archaeology, the last of which has dated the connection between Cyprus and mainland Levant to the early Iron Age. Archaeologists seeking a neutral orientation that is neither biblical nor national have used terms such as Levantine archaeology and archaeology of the Southern Levant.

While the usage of the term &quot;Levant&quot; in academia has been restricted to the fields of archeology and literature, there is a recent attempt to reclaim the notion of the Levant as a category of analysis in political and social sciences. Two academic journals were launched in the early 2010s using the word: the &quot;Journal of Levantine Studies&quot;, published by the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute and &quot;The Levantine Review&quot;, published by Boston College.

The word &quot;Levant&quot; has been used in some translations of the term &quot;ash-Shām&quot; as used by the organization known as ISIL, ISIS, and other names, though there is disagreement as to whether this translation is accurate.

===In archaeology: a definition===
In &quot;The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Levant: c. 8000–332 BCE&quot; (OHAL; 2013), the definition of the Levant for the specific purposes of the book is synonymous to that of the Arabic &quot;&quot;bilad al-sham&quot;, &#x27;the land of sham [Syria]&#x27;&quot;, translating in Western parlance to greater Syria. OHAL defines the boundaries of the Levant as follows.
* To the north: the Taurus Mountains or the Plain of &#x27;Amuq
* To the east: the eastern deserts, i.e. (from north to south) the Euphrates and the Jebel el-Bishrī area for the northern Levant, followed by the Syrian Desert east of the eastern hinterland of the Anti-Lebanon range (whose southernmost part is Mount Hermon), and Transjordan&#x27;s highlands and eastern desert (also discussed at Syrian Desert, also known as the Badia region). In other words, Mesopotamia and the North Arabian Desert.
* To the south: Wadi al-Arish in Sinai
* To the west: the Mediterranean Sea

;Subregions
A distinction is made between the main subregions of the Levant, the northern and the southern:
* The Litani River marks the division between the Northern Levant and the Southern Levant.
The island of Cyprus is also included as a third subregion in the archaeological region of the Levant:
* Cyprus, geographically distinct from the Levant, is included due to its proximity and natural resources (copper in particular), which induced close cultural ties.

==History==

==Demographics==
=== Religious and ethnic groups ===

The vast majority of Levantines are Muslims. After the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, Islam was first introduced into the region. However, a Muslim majority in the Levant is presumed to have been reached by the 13th century. The majority of Levantine Muslims are Sunnis adhering to the four madhhabs (Hanafi, Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali and Maliki). Islamic minorities include the Alawites and Nizari Ismailis in Syria, and Twelver Shiites in Lebanon.

Levantine Christian groups include Greek Orthodox (Antiochian Greek), Syriac Orthodox, Eastern Catholic (Syriac Catholic, Melkite and Maronite), Roman Catholic (Latin), Nestorian, and Protestant. Armenians mostly belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. There are also Levantines or Franco-Levantines who adhere to Roman Catholicism. There are also Assyrians belonging to the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church.

Other religious groups in the Levant include Jews, Samaritans, Yazidis and Druze.

=== Languages ===
Most populations in the Levant speak Levantine Arabic (, ), a variety of Arabic descended from the pre-Islamic Arabic dialects of Syria and Hejazi Arabic, but retaining significant influence from Western Middle Aramaic. Levantine Arabic is usually classified as North Levantine Arabic in Lebanon, Syria, and parts of Turkey, and South Levantine Arabic in Palestine and Jordan. Each of these encompasses a spectrum of regional or urban/rural variations. In addition to the varieties normally grouped together as &quot;Levantine&quot;, a number of other varieties and dialects of Arabic are spoken in the Levant area, such as Levantine Bedawi Arabic (by Bedouins) and Mesopotamian Arabic (in eastern Syria).

Of the languages of Cyprus, the two official languages are Turkish and Greek. The most used languages by population are Greek in the south followed by Turkish in the north. Two minority languages are recognized: Armenian, and Cypriot Maronite Arabic, a hybrid of mostly medieval Arabic vernaculars with strong influence from contact with Turkish and Greek, spoken by approximately 1,000 people.

In Israel, the official language is Hebrew, which is spoken by the majority of its population. Its Arab minority speaks the Arabic language.

Western Neo-Aramaic is additionally spoken in three villages in Syria: Maaloula, Jubb&#x27;adin and Bakhah.

Among diaspora communities based in the Levant, Greek, Armenian and Circassian are also spoken.

=== Genetics ===

According to recent ancient DNA studies, Levantines derive most of their ancestry from ancient Semitic-speaking peoples of the Bronze and Iron age Levant. Other Arabs include the Bedouins of Syrian Desert, Naqab and eastern Syria, who speak Bedouin Arabic. Non-Arab minorities include Circassians, Chechens, Turks, Jews, Turkmens, Assyrians, Kurds, Nawars and Armenians.

<doc id="18139" wikidata="Q426759" url="?curid=18139" title="League of Nations mandate">
<text>A League of Nations mandate represented a legal status under international law for specific territories following World War I, involving the transfer of control from one nation to another. These mandates served as legal documents establishing the internationally agreed terms for administering the territory on behalf of the League of Nations. Combining elements of both a treaty and a constitution, these mandates contained minority rights clauses that provided for the rights of petition and adjudication by the Permanent Court of International Justice.

The mandate system was established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, entered into force on 28 June 1919. With the dissolution of the League of Nations after World War II, it was stipulated at the Yalta Conference that the remaining mandates should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations, subject to future discussions and formal agreements. Most of the remaining mandates of the League of Nations (with the exception of South West Africa) thus eventually became United Nations trust territories.

Two governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-annexation of the territory and its administration as a &quot;sacred trust of civilisation&quot; to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.

According to historian Susan Pedersen, colonial administration in the mandates did not differ substantially from colonial administration elsewhere. Even though the Covenant of the League committed the great powers to govern the mandates differently, the main difference appeared to be that the colonial powers spoke differently about the mandates than their other colonial possessions.

==Basis==
The mandate system was established by Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, drafted by the victors of World War I. The article referred to territories which after the war were no longer ruled by their previous sovereign, but their peoples were not considered &quot;able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world&quot;. The article called for such people&#x27;s tutelage to be &quot;entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility&quot;.

U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and South African General Jan Smuts played influential roles in pushing for the establishment of a mandates system. The mandates system reflected a compromise between Smuts (who wanted colonial powers to annex the territories) and Wilson (who wanted trusteeship over the territories).

==Generalities==
All of the territories subject to League of Nations mandates were previously controlled by states defeated in World War I, principally Imperial Germany and the Ottoman Empire. The mandates were fundamentally different from the protectorates in that the mandatory power undertook obligations to the inhabitants of the territory and to the League of Nations.

The process of establishing the mandates consisted of two phases:
# The formal removal of sovereignty of the state previously controlling the territory.
# The transfer of mandatory powers to individual states among the Allied Powers.

===Treaties===
The divestiture of Germany&#x27;s overseas colonies, along with three territories disentangled from its European homeland area (the Free City of Danzig, the Memel Territory, and the Saar), was accomplished in the Treaty of Versailles (1919), with the territories being allotted among the Allies on 7 May of that year. Ottoman territorial claims were first addressed in the Treaty of Sèvres (1920) and finalised in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). The Ottoman territories were allotted among the Allied Powers at the San Remo conference in 1920.

==Types of mandates==

The League of Nations decided the exact level of control by the mandatory power over each mandate on an individual basis. However, in every case the mandatory power was forbidden to construct fortifications or raise an army within the territory of the mandate, and was required to present an annual report on the territory to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations.

The mandates were divided into three distinct groups based upon the level of development each population had achieved at that time.

===Class A mandates===
The first group, or &quot;Class A mandates&quot;, were territories formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire that were deemed to &quot;... have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.&quot;

===Class B mandates===
The second group of mandates, or &quot;Class B mandates&quot;, were all former German colonies in West and Central Africa, referred to by Germany as (protectorates or territories), which were deemed to require a greater level of control by the mandatory power: &quot;...the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion.&quot; The mandatory power was forbidden to construct military or naval bases within the mandates.

===Class C mandates===
&quot;Class C mandates&quot;, including South West Africa and the South Pacific Islands, were considered to be &quot;best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory.&quot;

==List of mandates==
==Rules of establishment==

According to the Council of the League of Nations, meeting of August 1920: &quot;draft mandates adopted by the Allied and Associated Powers would not be definitive until they had been considered and approved by the League... the legal title held by the mandatory Power must be a double one: one conferred by the Principal Powers and the other conferred by the League of Nations.&quot;

Three steps were required to establish a Mandate under international law: (1) The Principal Allied and Associated Powers confer a mandate on one of their number or on a third power; (2) the principal powers officially notify the council of the League of Nations that a certain power has been appointed mandatory for such a certain defined territory; and (3) the council of the League of Nations takes official cognisance of the appointment of the mandatory power and informs the latter that it [the council] considers it as invested with the mandate, and at the same time notifies it of the terms of the mandate, after ascertaining whether they are in conformance with the provisions of the covenant.&quot;

The U.S. State Department&#x27;s &quot;Digest of International Law&quot; says that the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne provided for the application of the principles of state succession to the &quot;A&quot; Mandates. The Treaty of Versailles provisionally recognised the former Ottoman communities as independent nations. It also required Germany to recognise the disposition of the former Ottoman territories and to recognise the new states laid down within their boundaries. The terms of the Treaty of Lausanne required the newly created states that acquired the territory detached from the Ottoman Empire to pay annuities on the Ottoman public debt and to assume responsibility for the administration of concessions that had been granted by the Ottomans. The treaty also let the States acquire, without payment, all the property and possessions of the Ottoman Empire situated within their territory. The treaty provided that the League of Nations was responsible for establishing an arbitral court to resolve disputes that might arise and stipulated that its decisions were final.

A disagreement regarding the legal status and the portion of the annuities to be paid by the &quot;A&quot; mandates was settled when an Arbitrator ruled that some of the mandates contained more than one State:The difficulty arises here how one is to regard the Asiatic countries under the British and French mandates. Iraq is a Kingdom in regard to which Great Britain has undertaken responsibilities equivalent to those of a Mandatory Power. Under the British mandate, Palestine and Transjordan have each an entirely separate organisation. We are, therefore, in the presence of three States sufficiently separate to be considered as distinct Parties. France has received a single mandate from the Council of the League of Nations, but in the countries subject to that mandate, one can distinguish two distinct States: Syria and the Lebanon, each State possessing its own constitution and a nationality clearly different from the other.

==Later history==
After the United Nations was founded in 1945 and the League of Nations was disbanded, all but one of the mandated territories became United Nations trust territories, a roughly equivalent status. In each case, the colonial power that held the mandate on each territory became the administering power of the trusteeship, except that of the Empire of Japan, which had been defeated in World War II, lost its mandate over the South Pacific islands, which became a &quot;strategic trust territory&quot; known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands under U.S. administration.

The sole exception to the transformation of the League of Nations mandates into UN trusteeships was that of South Africa and its mandated territory South West Africa. Rather than placing South West Africa under trusteeship like other former mandates, South Africa proposed annexation, a proposition rejected by the UN General Assembly. Despite South Africa&#x27;s resistance, the International Court of Justice affirmed that South Africa continued to have international obligations regarding the South West Africa mandate. Eventually, in 1990, the mandated territory, now Namibia, gained independence, culminating from the Tripartite Accords and the resolution of the South African Border War — a prolonged guerrilla conflict against the apartheid regime that lasted from 1966 until 1990.

Nearly all the former League of Nations mandates had become sovereign states by 1990, including all of the former UN trust territories with the exception of a few successor entities of the gradually dismembered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (formerly Japan&#x27;s South Pacific Trust Mandate). These exceptions include the Northern Mariana Islands which is a commonwealth in political union with the U.S. with the status of unincorporated organised territory. The Northern Mariana Islands does elect its own governor to serve as territorial head of government, but it remains a U.S. territory with its head of state being the President of the United States and federal funds to the commonwealth administered by the Office of Insular Affairs of the U.S. Department of the Interior.

Remnant Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, the heirs of the last territories of the Trust, attained final independence on 22 December 1990. (The UN Security Council ratified termination of trusteeship, effectively dissolving trusteeship status, on 10 July 1987.) The Republic of Palau, split off from the Federated States of Micronesia, became the last to effectively gain its independence, on 1 October 1994.

<doc id="18142" wikidata="Q6685995" url="?curid=18142" title="Loudon Classic">
<text>The Loudon Classic, originally named the Laconia Classic, is an annual motorcycle road racing competition held during the Laconia Motorcycle Week at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, New Hampshire. Founded in 1934 when it was originally sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), the race is one of the oldest motorcycle competitions in the United States. The competition changed locations over the years, starting as a dirt track race before evolving into a road race. From the late 1930s until the early 2000s, the Loudon Classic was one of the most prestigious motorcycle races in the United States, second only to the Daytona 200. 

==History==
===Rally beginnings===
In the 1910s the New Hampshire Lakes Region became a popular riding destination for early motorcycle enthusiasts. Unlike the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally which originated as a motorcycle race, the Loudon Classic originated as a motorcycle rally. When motorcycle sales began to decline as a result of the introduction of the low cost Ford Model T, the American motorcycle industry body, the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM) sought to boost sales by sponsoring a series of Gypsy tours, so called because the participants camped in large gatherings like Romani people. The annual tour held at Weirs Beach in Laconia, New Hampshire on the southern shore of Lake Winnipesaukee, became the most popular of these tours due to its proximity to Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Montreal.

===Dirt track roots===
In 1933, the AMA introduced a new racing category called Class C which featured street-legal motorcycles in an effort to make motorcycle racing less expensive for ordinary motorcyclists. Street-legal motorcycles were known at the time as touring motorcycles hence, a tourist trophy (TT) signified a race classification for street-legal motorcycles. Informal motorcycle racing had occurred at previous Weirs Beach rallies however, the first race formally sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), occurred in 1934 when, a dirt track TT race for Class C motorcycles was held on a 3.3 mile track in Swanzey, New Hampshire that used partially paved and unimproved gravel roads, up and down gently rolling hills. Local rider Babe Tancrede won the inaugural Laconia Classic riding a Harley-Davidson.

===Belknap circuit===
In 1937 the race moved to Old Orchard Beach, Maine where it was held as a event for only one year then, in 1938 it was moved to a 1.0-mile track in the Belknap Recreational Area, now known as the Gunstock Mountain Resort near Laconia, New Hampshire. The Belknap circuit featured crudely paved roads as well as improved gravel roads. Although the event became known as the Laconia Classic, the Belknap Recreational Area was located in nearby Gilford, New Hampshire. An integral promoter responsible for bringing the race to Belknap was Fritzie Baer, an Indian motorcycle dealer from Springfield, Massachusetts who would promote the race until 1963. 

Along with the move to Belknap, the event was accredited national championship status by the AMA in 1938. Indian rider Ed Kretz, who had won the inaugural Daytona 200 in 1937, won the first national championship race held at Belknap in 1938. His victory marked the only 200 mile Laconia Classic as, the race distance was reduced to 100 miles in 1939. In 1940, the circuit was converted from dirt and gravel to a fully paved course and, the AMA changed the race classification from a TT national to a road race national. 

Dick Klamfoth&#x27;s 1951 Laconia Classic victory on a Norton marked the first win by a foreign manufacturer. Harley-Davidson rider Brad Andres was the most successful competitor during the Belknap era with four victories in five years between 1955 and 1959. Three-time Grand National Champion Joe Leonard won the event three times before going on to a successful auto racing career. Harley-Davidson would win 13 of the 20 races held at Belknap, despite the track being near the Springfield, Massachusetts factory of their largest competitor, Indian motorcycles. 

The event surged in popularity after the Second World War drawing increasingly larger crowds of spectators. The race grew to become a weeklong event known as Laconia Motorcycle Week that was the largest annual gathering of North American motorcyclists, until it was overtaken by the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally during the 1970s. When the overwhelming number of spectators created a rash of minor incidents in 1963, local residents protested the event. Unwilling to risk the increasing costs of property damage, and unable to reach an agreement with local officials, race promoters closed the Belknap track in 1964. The final race at the Belknap circuit held in 1963 was won by Jody Nicholas riding a BSA motorcycle.

===Bryar Motorsports Park===
The closure of the Belknap circuit resulted in the construction of the new 1.6-mile Bryar Motorsports Park in 1965, located 20 miles south of Laconia in Loudon, New Hampshire. The Laconia Classic gradually became known as the Loudon Classic. The Bryar Motorsports Park track road course followed the contours of a hillside around a small lake. Compressing 11 turns within its 1.6-mile length, the track was short and tight, making it one of the best venues to watch motorcycle racing in the United States. Slight elevation changes in the track layout allowed many spectators to follow a racer for a complete lap of the circuit. 

The track developed a reputation for its challenging nature as, riders were constantly applying throttle or their brakes for the entire lap. It rewarded a rider&#x27;s skill over horsepower and its many turns allowed for aggressive racing. The circuit hosted numerous amateur races during the year which bred many local track experts who often provided challenging competition for national championship level riders when they arrived for the annual Loudon Classic.

Gary Nixon and Mike Baldwin were the most successful competitors during the Bryar Motorsports era, each with four victories. When Gary Fisher won the race in 1972 riding a Yamaha, he joined his father, 1953 Laconia Classic winner Ed Fisher, as the only father son duo to have won the race. His victory aboard a Yamaha also marked the first victory by a Japanese manufacturer in the history of the event. Fisher&#x27;s 1972 victory marked the last 100-mile national as, the race distance was reduced to 75-miles for 1973. Carter Alsop became the first female competitor in an AMA professional road race when she entered the Novice Class at the 1977 Loudon Classic. Jamie James won the final race on the Bryar Motorsports Park circuit in 1989 before it was purchased by Bob Bahre, who built the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in its place.

===New Hampshire Motor Speedway===
Construction of the New Hampshire Motor Speedway was completed in 1990. The Loudon Classic continued as a national championship race at the new speedway until 2001 however, a combination of safety issues and more powerful motorcycles eventually made the track obsolete for AMA Superbike events. Eric Bostrom won the final AMA National Championship race at Loudon in 2001. Since 2002 the race has continued featuring semi-professional racers.

<text>Lincoln is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. It is the second-largest town by area in New Hampshire. The population was 1,631 at the 2020 census. The town is home to the New Hampshire Highland Games and to a portion of Franconia Notch State Park. Set in the White Mountains, large portions of the town are within the White Mountain National Forest. The Appalachian Trail crosses the western and northeastern parts of the town. Lincoln is the location of Loon Mountain Ski Resort and associated recreation-centered development.

The primary settlement in town, where 969 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Lincoln census-designated place (CDP) and is located along New Hampshire Route 112 east of Interstate 93. The town also includes the former village sites of Stillwater and Zealand (sometimes known as Pullman) in the town&#x27;s remote eastern and northern sections respectively, which are now within the White Mountain National Forest.

==History==


In 1764, colonial Governor Benning Wentworth granted to a group of approximately 70 land investors from Connecticut. Lincoln was named after Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle, 9th Earl of Lincoln – a cousin of the Wentworth governors. He held the position of comptroller of customs for the port of London under King George II and George III, which was important to trade between America and England.

The town was settled about 1782. The 1790 census indicates that it had 22 inhabitants. Rocky soil yielded poor farming, but the area&#x27;s abundant timber, combined with water power to run sawmills on the Pemigewasset River and its East Branch, helped Lincoln develop into a center for logging. By 1853, the Merrimack River Lumber Company was operating. The railroad transported freight, and increasingly brought tourists to the beautiful mountain region. In 1892, James Everell Henry (1831–1912) bought approximately of virgin timber and established a logging enterprise at what is today the center of Lincoln. In 1902, he built a pulp and paper mill. He erected the Lincoln House hotel in 1903, although a 1907 fire would nearly raze the community. Until he died in 1912, Henry controlled his company town, installing relatives in positions of civic authority.

In 1917, Henry&#x27;s heirs sold the business to the Parker Young Company, which in turn sold it to the Marcalus Manufacturing Company in 1946. Franconia Paper took over in 1950, producing 150 tons of paper a day until bankruptcy in 1971, at which time new river classification standards discouraged further papermaking in Lincoln.

Tourism is today the principal business. Nearby Loon Mountain has long drawn skiers, and in recent years has attempted to convert itself into a four-season attraction. The Flume is one of the most visited attractions in the state. Discovered in 1808, it is a natural canyon extending at the base of Mount Liberty. Walls of Conway granite rise to a height of and are only apart.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.43% of the town. It is the second-largest town in area in New Hampshire, after Pittsburg.

Lincoln is drained by the Pemigewasset River and its East Branch. Lincoln lies almost fully within the Merrimack River watershed, with the western edge of town in the Connecticut River watershed. Kancamagus Pass, elevation , is on the Kancamagus Highway at the eastern boundary. The highest point in Lincoln is the summit of Mount Bond at above sea level.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 1,662 people, 794 households, and 439 families residing in the town. There were 2,988 housing units, of which 2,194, or 73.4%, were vacant. 2,083 of the vacant units were for seasonal or recreational use. The racial makeup of the town was 96.9% white, 0.3% African American, 0.1% Native American, 1.7% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.3% some other race, and 0.6% from two or more races. 1.7% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 794 households, 21.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.1% were headed by married couples living together, 7.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 44.7% were non-families. Of all households, 37.0% were made up of individuals, and 13.4% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.09, and the average family size was 2.75.

In the town, 18.7% of the population were under the age of 18, 6.8% were from 18 to 24, 19.4% from 25 to 44, 34.8% from 45 to 64, and 20.4% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 105.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.3 males.

For the period 2011–2015, the estimated median annual income for a household was $37,095, and the median income for a family was $55,326. Male full-time workers had a median income of $31,106 versus $27,381 for females. The per capita income for the town was $24,109. 21.0% of the population and 9.1% of families were below the poverty line. 20.2% of the population under the age of 18 and 8.6% of those 65 or older were living in poverty.

<doc id="18145" wikidata="Q21651845" url="?curid=18145" title="List of laser applications">
<text>Many scientific, military, medical and commercial laser applications have been developed since the invention of the laser in 1958. The coherency, high monochromaticity, and ability to reach extremely high powers are all properties which allow for these specialized applications.

==Scientific==

In science, lasers are used in many ways, including:
* A wide variety of interferometric techniques
* Raman spectroscopy
* Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy
* Atmospheric &quot;remote sensing&quot;
* Investigating nonlinear optics phenomena
* Holographic techniques employing lasers also contribute to a number of measurement techniques.
* Laser based lidar (LIght raDAR) technology applications in geology, seismology, remote sensing and atmospheric physics.
* Three-dimensional structural modifications and writing inside technological materials.
* Lasers have been used aboard spacecraft such as in the Cassini-Huygens mission.
* In astronomy, lasers have been used to create artificial &quot;laser guide stars&quot;, used as reference objects for adaptive optics telescopes.

Lasers may also be indirectly used in spectroscopy as a micro-sampling system, a technique termed Laser ablation (LA), which is typically applied to ICP-MS apparatus resulting in the powerful LA-ICP-MS.

The principles of laser spectroscopy are discussed by Demtröder.

===Spectroscopy===
Most types of laser are an inherently pure source of light; they emit near-monochromatic light with a very well defined range of wavelengths. By careful design of the laser components, the purity of the laser light (measured as the &quot;linewidth&quot;) can be improved more than the purity of any other light source. This makes the laser a very useful source for spectroscopy. The high intensity of light that can be achieved in a small, well collimated beam can also be used to induce a nonlinear optical effect in a sample, which makes techniques such as Raman spectroscopy possible. Other spectroscopic techniques based on lasers can be used to make extremely sensitive detectors of various molecules, able to measure molecular concentrations in the parts-per-1012 (ppt) level. Due to the high power densities achievable by lasers, beam-induced atomic emission is possible: this technique is termed Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).

===Heat treatment===
Heat treating with the lasers allows selective surface hardening against wear with little or no distortion of the component. Because this eliminates much part reworking that is currently done, the laser system&#x27;s capital cost is recovered in a short time. An inert, absorbent coating for laser heat treatment has also been developed that eliminates the fumes generated by conventional paint coatings during the heat-treating process with laser beams.

One consideration crucial to the success of a heat treatment operation is control of the laser beam irradiance on the part surface. The optimal irradiance distribution is driven by the thermodynamics of the laser-material interaction and by the part geometry.

Typically, irradiances between 500 and 5000 W/cm^2 satisfy the thermodynamic constraints and allow the rapid surface heating and minimal total heat input required. For general heat treatment, a uniform square or rectangular beam is one of the best options. For some special applications or applications where the heat treatment is done on an edge or corner of the part, it may be better to have the irradiance decrease near the edge to prevent melting.

=== Weather ===
Research shows that scientists may one day be able to induce rain and lightning storms (as well as micro-manipulating some other weather phenomena) using high energy lasers. Such a breakthrough could potentially eradicate droughts, help alleviate weather related catastrophes, and allocate weather resources to areas in need.

===Lunar laser ranging===

When the Apollo astronauts visited the Moon, they planted retroreflector arrays to make possible the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment. Laser beams are focused through large telescopes on Earth aimed toward the arrays, and the time taken for the beam to be reflected back to Earth measured to determine the distance between the Earth and Moon with high accuracy.

===Photochemistry===
Some laser systems, through the process of mode locking, can produce extremely brief pulses of light - as short as picoseconds or femtoseconds (10−12 - 10−15 seconds). Such pulses can be used to initiate and analyze chemical reactions, a technique known as &quot;photochemistry&quot;. The short pulses can be used to probe the process of the reaction at a very high temporal resolution, allowing the detection of short-lived intermediate molecules. This method is particularly useful in biochemistry, where it is used to analyse details of protein folding and function.

===Laser scanner===

Laser barcode scanners are ideal for applications that require high speed reading of linear codes or stacked symbols.

===Laser cooling===

A technique that has recent success is &quot;laser cooling&quot;. This involves atom trapping, a method where a number of atoms are confined in a specially shaped arrangement of electric and magnetic fields. Shining particular wavelengths of light at the ions or atoms slows them down, thus &quot;cooling&quot; them. As this process is continued, they all are slowed and have the same energy level, forming an unusual arrangement of matter known as a Bose–Einstein condensate.

=== Nuclear fusion ===
Some of the world&#x27;s most powerful and complex arrangements of multiple lasers and optical amplifiers are used to produce extremely high intensity pulses of light of extremely short duration, e.g. laboratory for laser energetics, National Ignition Facility, GEKKO XII, Nike laser, Laser Mégajoule, HiPER. These pulses are arranged such that they impact pellets of tritium–deuterium simultaneously from all directions, hoping that the squeezing effect of the impacts will induce atomic fusion in the pellets. This technique, known as &quot;inertial confinement fusion&quot;, so far has not been able to achieve &quot;breakeven&quot;, that is, so far the fusion reaction generates less power than is used to power the lasers, however; experiments at the National Ignition Facility were able to demonstrate fusion reactions that generate more energy than was contained within the lasers driving the reaction.

=== Particle acceleration ===

Powerful lasers producing ultra-short (in the tens of femtoseconds) and ultra-intense (up to 1023 W/cm2) laser pulses offer much greater acceleration gradients than that of conventional accelerators. This fact is exploited in several plasma acceleration techniques used for accelerating both electrons and charged ions to high energies.

===Microscopy===
Confocal laser scanning microscopy and Two-photon excitation microscopy make use of lasers to obtain blur-free images of thick specimens at various depths. Laser capture microdissection use lasers to procure specific cell populations from a tissue section under microscopic visualization.

Additional laser microscopy techniques include harmonic microscopy, four-wave mixing microscopy and interferometric microscopy.

==Military==

===Directly as an energy weapon===
A laser weapon is directed-energy weapon based on lasers.
===Defensive countermeasures===
Defensive countermeasure applications can range from compact, low power infrared countermeasures to high power, airborne laser systems. IR countermeasure systems use lasers to confuse the seeker heads on infrared homing missiles.

===Disorientation===
Some weapons simply use a laser to disorient a person. One such weapon is the Thales Green Laser Optical Warner.

=== Guidance ===
Laser guidance is a technique of guiding a missile or other projectile or vehicle to a target by means of a laser beam.

===Target designator===


Another military use of lasers is as a &quot;laser target designator&quot;. This is a low-power laser pointer used to indicate a target for a precision-guided munition, typically launched from an aircraft. The guided munition adjusts its flight-path to home in to the laser light reflected by the target, enabling a great precision in aiming. The beam of the laser target designator is set to a pulse rate that matches that set on the guided munition to ensure munitions strike their designated targets and do not follow other laser beams which may be in use in the area. The laser designator can be shone onto the target by an aircraft or nearby infantry. Lasers used for this purpose are usually infrared lasers, so the enemy cannot easily detect the guiding laser light.

===Firearms===

====Laser sight====
The laser has in most firearms applications been used as a tool to enhance the targeting of other weapon systems. For example, a laser sight is a small, usually visible-light laser placed on a handgun or a rifle and aligned to emit a beam parallel to the barrel. Since a laser beam has low divergence, the laser light appears as a small spot even at long distances; the user places the spot on the desired target and the barrel of the gun is aligned (but not necessarily allowing for bullet drop, windage, distance between the direction of the beam and the axis of the barrel, and the target mobility while the bullet travels).

Most laser sights use a red laser diode. Others use an infrared diode to produce a dot invisible to the naked human eye but detectable with night vision devices. The firearms adaptive target acquisition module LLM01 laser light module combines visible and infrared laser diodes. In the late 1990s, green diode pumped solid state laser (DPSS) laser sights (532 nm) became available.

====Eye-targeted lasers====
A non-lethal laser weapon was developed by the U.S. Air Force to temporarily impair an adversary&#x27;s ability to fire a weapon or to otherwise threaten enemy forces. This unit illuminates an opponent with harmless low-power laser light and can have the effect of dazzling or disorienting the subject or causing them to flee. Several types of dazzlers are now available, and some have been used in combat.

There remains the possibility of using lasers to blind, since this requires relatively low power levels and is easily achievable in a man-portable unit. However, most nations regard the deliberate permanent blinding of the enemy as forbidden by the rules of war (see Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons). Although several nations have developed blinding laser weapons, such as China&#x27;s ZM-87, none of these are believed to have made it past the prototype stage.

In addition to the applications that cross over with military applications, a widely known law enforcement use of lasers is for lidar to measure the speed of vehicles.

====Holographic weapon sight====
A holographic weapon sight uses a laser diode to illuminate a hologram of a reticle built into a flat glass optical window of the sight. The user looks through the optical window and sees a cross hair reticle image superimposed at a distance on the field of view.

==Industrial and commercial==

Industrial laser applications can be divided into two categories depending on the power of the laser: material processing and micro-material processing.

In material processing, lasers with average optical power above 1 kilowatt are used mainly for industrial materials processing applications. Beyond this power threshold there are thermal issues related to the optics that separate these lasers from their lower-power counterparts. Laser systems in the 50-300W range are used primarily for pumping, plastic welding and soldering applications. Lasers above 300W are used in brazing, thin metal welding, and sheet metal cutting applications. The required brightness (as measured in by the beam parameter product) is higher for cutting applications than for brazing and thin metal welding. High power applications, such as hardening, cladding, and deep penetrating welding, require multiple kW of optical power, and are used in a broad range of industrial processes.

Micro material processing is a category that includes all laser material processing applications under 1 kilowatt. The use of lasers in Micro Materials Processing has found broad application in the development and manufacturing of screens for smartphones, tablet computers, and LED TVs.

A detailed list of industrial and commercial laser applications includes:

* Laser cutting

<text>Left-arm orthodox spin or left-arm off spin, also known as slow left-arm orthodox spin bowling, is a type of spin bowling in cricket.
Bowlers using this technique bowl with their left-arm and a finger spin action. Their normal delivery spins from right to left (from the bowler&#x27;s perspective) when it bounces on the pitch.

Left-arm orthodox spin bowlers generally attempt to drift the ball in the air into a right-handed batsman, and then turn it away from the batsman (towards off-stump) upon landing on the pitch. The drift and turn in the air are attacking techniques. The normal delivery of a left-arm orthodox spin bowler is the left-arm orthodox spinner.

The major variations of a left-arm orthodox spin bowler are the topspinner (which turns less and bounces higher in the cricket pitch), the arm ball (which does not turn at all and drifts into a right-handed batsman in the direction of the bowler&#x27;s arm movement; also called a &#x27;floater&#x27;) and the left-arm spinner&#x27;s version of a doosra (which turns the other way).

<doc id="18151" wikidata="Q1327779" url="?curid=18151" title="Laser construction">
<text>A laser is constructed from three principal parts:

*An energy source (usually referred to as the &quot;pump&quot; or &quot;pump source&quot;),
*A &quot;gain medium&quot; or &quot;laser medium&quot;, and
*Two or more mirrors that form an &quot;optical resonator&quot;.

==Pump source==
The &quot;pump source&quot; is the part that provides energy to the laser system. Examples of pump sources include electrical discharges, flashlamps, arc lamps, light from another laser, chemical reactions and even explosive devices. The type of pump source used principally depends on the &quot;gain medium&quot;, and this also determines how the energy is transmitted to the medium. A helium–neon (HeNe) laser uses an electrical discharge in the helium-neon gas mixture, a uses either light focused from a xenon flash lamp or diode lasers, and excimer lasers use a chemical reaction.

==Gain medium / Laser medium==
The &quot;gain medium&quot; is the major determining factor of the wavelength of operation, and other properties, of the laser. &quot;Gain media&quot; in different materials have linear spectra or wide spectra. &quot;Gain media&quot; with wide spectra allow tuning of the laser frequency. There are hundreds if not thousands of different gain media in which laser operation has been achieved (see list of laser types for a list of the most important ones). The gain medium is excited by the pump source to produce a population inversion, and it is in the gain medium where spontaneous and stimulated emission of photons takes place, leading to the phenomenon of optical gain, or amplification.

Examples of different gain media include:
*Liquids, such as dye lasers. These are usually organic chemical solvents, such as methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol, to which are added chemical dyes such as coumarin, rhodamine, and fluorescein. The exact chemical configuration of the dye molecules determines the operation wavelength of the dye laser.
*Gases, such as carbon dioxide, argon, krypton and mixtures such as helium–neon. These lasers are often pumped by electrical discharge.
*Solids, such as crystals and glasses. The solid &quot;host&quot; materials are usually doped with an impurity such as chromium, neodymium, erbium or titanium ions. Typical hosts include YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet), YLF (yttrium lithium fluoride), sapphire (aluminium oxide) and various glasses. Examples of solid-state laser media include Nd:YAG, Ti:sapphire, Cr:sapphire (usually known as ruby), Cr:LiSAF (chromium-doped lithium strontium aluminium fluoride), Er:YLF, Nd:glass, and Er:glass. Solid-state lasers are usually pumped by flashlamps or light from another laser.
*Semiconductors, a type of solid, crystal with uniform dopant distribution or material with differing dopant levels in which the movement of electrons can cause laser action. Semiconductor lasers are typically very small, and can be pumped with a simple electric current, enabling them to be used in consumer devices such as compact disc players. See laser diode.

==Optical resonator==

The &quot;optical resonator&quot;, or &quot;optical cavity&quot;, in its simplest form is two parallel mirrors placed around the gain medium, which provide feedback of the light. The mirrors are given optical coatings which determine their reflective properties. Typically, one will be a high reflector, and the other will be a partial reflector. The latter is called the output coupler, because it allows some of the light to leave the cavity to produce the laser&#x27;s output beam.

Light from the medium, produced by spontaneous emission, is reflected by the mirrors back into the medium, where it may be amplified by stimulated emission. The light may reflect from the mirrors and thus pass through the gain medium many hundreds of times before exiting the cavity. In more complex lasers, configurations with four or more mirrors forming the cavity are used. The design and alignment of the mirrors with respect to the medium is crucial for determining the exact operating wavelength and other attributes of the laser system.

Other optical devices, such as spinning mirrors, modulators, filters, and absorbers, may be placed within the optical resonator to produce a variety of effects on the laser output, such as altering the wavelength of operation or the production of pulses of laser light.

Some lasers do not use an optical cavity, but instead rely on very high optical gain to produce significant amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) without needing feedback of the light back into the gain medium. Such lasers are said to be superluminescent, and emit light with low coherence but high bandwidth. Since they do not use optical feedback, these devices are often not categorized as lasers.

<doc id="18152" wikidata="Q191081" url="?curid=18152" title="Logical conjunction">
<text>In logic, mathematics and linguistics, &quot;and&quot; (formula_1) is the truth-functional operator of conjunction or logical conjunction. The logical connective of this operator is typically represented as formula_1 or formula_3 or formula_4 (prefix) or formula_5 or formula_6 in which formula_1 is the most modern and widely used.

The &quot;and&quot; of a set of operands is true if and only if &quot;all&quot; of its operands are true, i.e., formula_8 is true if and only if formula_9 is true and formula_10 is true.

An operand of a conjunction is a conjunct.

Beyond logic, the term &quot;conjunction&quot; also refers to similar concepts in other fields:

* In natural language, the denotation of expressions such as English &quot;and&quot;;
* In programming languages, the short-circuit and control structure;
* In set theory, intersection.
* In lattice theory, logical conjunction (greatest lower bound).

==Notation==

And is usually denoted by an infix operator: in mathematics and logic, it is denoted by a &quot;wedge&quot; formula_1 (Unicode ), formula_3 or formula_5; in electronics, formula_6; and in programming languages codice_1, codice_2, or codice_3. In Jan Łukasiewicz&#x27;s prefix notation for logic, the operator is formula_4, for Polish &quot;koniunkcja&quot;.

In mathematics, the conjunction of an arbitrary number of elements formula_16 can be denoted as an iterated binary operation using a &quot;big wedge&quot; ⋀ (Unicode ):

formula_17

==Definition==
In classical logic, logical conjunction is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of &quot;true&quot; if and only if (also known as iff) both of its operands are true.

The conjunctive identity is true, which is to say that AND-ing an expression with true will never change the value of the expression. In keeping with the concept of vacuous truth, when conjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary arity, the empty conjunction (AND-ing over an empty set of operands) is often defined as having the result true.

===Truth table===
The truth table of formula_8:

===Defined by other operators===
In systems where logical conjunction is not a primitive, it may be defined as
:formula_19
It can be checked by the following truth table (compare the last two columns):
or
:formula_20
It can be checked by the following truth table (compare the last two columns):

==Introduction and elimination rules==
As a rule of inference, conjunction introduction is a classically valid, simple argument form. The argument form has two premises, formula_9 and formula_10. Intuitively, it permits the inference of their conjunction.

:formula_9,
:formula_10.
:Therefore, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

or in logical operator notation, where \vdash expresses provability:
:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27

Here is an example of an argument that fits the form &quot;conjunction introduction&quot;:

:Bob likes apples.
:Bob likes oranges.
:Therefore, Bob likes apples and Bob likes oranges.

Conjunction elimination is another classically valid, simple argument form. Intuitively, it permits the inference from any conjunction of either element of that conjunction.

:formula_9 and formula_10.
:Therefore, formula_9.

...or alternatively,

:formula_9 and formula_10.
:Therefore, formula_10.

In logical operator notation:
:formula_27
:formula_35

...or alternatively,

:formula_27
:formula_26

== Negation ==
=== Definition ===
A conjunction formula_38 is proven false by establishing either formula_39 or formula_40. In terms of the object language, this reads

:formula_41

This formula can be seen as a special case of

:formula_42

when formula_43 is a false proposition.

=== Other proof strategies ===
If formula_9 implies formula_40, then both formula_39 as well as formula_9 prove the conjunction false:
:formula_48
In other words, a conjunction can actually be proven false just by knowing about the relation of its conjuncts, and not necessary about their truth values.

This formula can be seen as a special case of
:formula_49

when formula_43 is a false proposition.

Either of the above are constructively valid proofs by contradiction.

==Properties==
commutativity: yes
associativity: yes
distributivity: with various operations, especially with &quot;or&quot;


idempotency: yes&lt;br&gt;
monotonicity: yes
truth-preserving: yes&lt;br&gt;When all inputs are true, the output is true.
falsehood-preserving: yes&lt;br&gt;When all inputs are false, the output is false.
Walsh spectrum: (1,-1,-1,1)

Nonlinearity: 1 (the function is bent)

If using binary values for true (1) and false (0), then &quot;logical conjunction&quot; works exactly like normal arithmetic multiplication.

==Applications in computer engineering==

In high-level computer programming and digital electronics, logical conjunction is commonly represented by an infix operator, usually as a keyword such as &quot;codice_4&quot;, an algebraic multiplication, or the ampersand symbol codice_1 (sometimes doubled as in codice_2). Many languages also provide short-circuit control structures corresponding to logical conjunction.

Logical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations, where codice_7 corresponds to false and codice_8 to true:

* codice_9  =  codice_7,
* codice_11  =  codice_7,
* codice_13  =  codice_7,
* codice_15  =  codice_8.

The operation can also be applied to two binary words viewed as bitstrings of equal length, by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions. For example:

* codice_17  =  codice_18.

This can be used to select part of a bitstring using a bit mask. For example, codice_19  =  codice_20 extracts the fourth bit of an 8-bit bitstring.

In computer networking, bit masks are used to derive the network address of a subnet within an existing network from a given IP address, by ANDing the IP address and the subnet mask.

Logical conjunction &quot;codice_4&quot; is also used in SQL operations to form database queries.

The Curry–Howard correspondence relates logical conjunction to product types.

==Set-theoretic correspondence==
The membership of an element of an intersection set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical conjunction: formula_51 if and only if formula_52. Through this correspondence, set-theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction, such as associativity, commutativity and idempotence.

==Natural language==
As with other notions formalized in mathematical logic, the logical conjunction &quot;and&quot; is related to, but not the same as, the grammatical conjunction &quot;and&quot; in natural languages.

English &quot;and&quot; has properties not captured by logical conjunction. For example, &quot;and&quot; sometimes implies order having the sense of &quot;then&quot;. For example, &quot;They got married and had a child&quot; in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child.

The word &quot;and&quot; can also imply a partition of a thing into parts, as &quot;The American flag is red, white, and blue.&quot; Here, it is not meant that the flag is &quot;at once&quot; red, white, and blue, but rather that each color is a part of the flag.

<text>In logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator, sentential connective, or sentential operator) is a logical constant. Connectives can be used to connect logical formulas. For instance in the syntax of propositional logic, the binary connective formula_1 can be used to join the two atomic formulas formula_2 and formula_3, rendering the complex formula formula_4.

Common connectives include negation, disjunction, conjunction, implication, and equivalence. In standard systems of classical logic, these connectives are interpreted as truth functions, though they receive a variety of alternative interpretations in nonclassical logics. Their classical interpretations are similar to the meanings of natural language expressions such as English &quot;not&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, and &quot;if&quot;, but not identical. Discrepancies between natural language connectives and those of classical logic have motivated nonclassical approaches to natural language meaning as well as approaches which pair a classical compositional semantics with a robust pragmatics.

== Overview ==
In formal languages, truth functions are represented by unambiguous symbols. This allows logical statements to not be understood in an ambiguous way. These symbols are called &quot;logical connectives&quot;, &quot;logical operators&quot;, &quot;propositional operators&quot;, or, in classical logic, &quot;truth-functional connectives&quot;. For the rules which allow new well-formed formulas to be constructed by joining other well-formed formulas using truth-functional connectives, see well-formed formula.

Logical connectives can be used to link zero or more statements, so one can speak about &quot;-ary logical connectives&quot;. The boolean constants &quot;True&quot; and &quot;False&quot; can be thought of as zero-ary operators. Negation is a unary connective, and so on.

===List of common logical connectives===
Commonly used logical connectives include the following ones. 
* Negation (not): formula_5, formula_6, formula_7 (prefix) in which formula_5 is the most modern and widely used, and formula_6 is also common;
* Conjunction (and): formula_10, formula_11, formula_12 (prefix) in which formula_10 is the most modern and widely used;
* Disjunction (or): formula_14, formula_15 (prefix) in which formula_14 is the most modern and widely used;
* Implication (if...then): formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20 (prefix) in which formula_17 is the most modern and widely used, and formula_18 is also common;
* Equivalence (if and only if): formula_23, formula_24, formula_25, formula_26, formula_27 (prefix) in which formula_23 is the most modern and widely used, and formula_24 is commonly used where formula_18 is also used.

For example, the meaning of the statements &quot;it is raining&quot; (denoted by formula_31) and &quot;I am indoors&quot; (denoted by formula_32) is transformed, when the two are combined with logical connectives:
* It is not raining (formula_33);
* It is raining and I am indoors (formula_34);
* It is raining or I am indoors (formula_35);
* If it is raining, then I am indoors (formula_36);
* If I am indoors, then it is raining (formula_37);
* I am indoors if and only if it is raining (formula_38).

It is also common to consider the &quot;always true&quot; formula and the &quot;always false&quot; formula to be connective (in which case they are nullary).
* True formula: formula_39, formula_40, formula_41 (prefix), or formula_42;
* False formula: formula_43, formula_44, formula_45 (prefix), or formula_46.

This table summarizes the terminology:

===History of notations===
* Negation: the symbol formula_5 appeared in Heyting in 1930 (compare to Frege&#x27;s symbol ⫟ in his Begriffsschrift); the symbol formula_6 appeared in Russell in 1908; an alternative notation is to add a horizontal line on top of the formula, as in formula_49; another alternative notation is to use a prime symbol as in formula_50.
* Conjunction: the symbol formula_10 appeared in Heyting in 1930 (compare to Peano&#x27;s use of the set-theoretic notation of intersection formula_52); the symbol formula_11 appeared at least in Schönfinkel in 1924; the symbol formula_54 comes from Boole&#x27;s interpretation of logic as an elementary algebra.
* Disjunction: the symbol formula_14 appeared in Russell in 1908 (compare to Peano&#x27;s use of the set-theoretic notation of union formula_56); the symbol formula_57 is also used, in spite of the ambiguity coming from the fact that the formula_57 of ordinary elementary algebra is an exclusive or when interpreted logically in a two-element ring; punctually in the history a formula_57 together with a dot in the lower right corner has been used by Peirce.
* Implication: the symbol formula_17 appeared in Hilbert in 1918; formula_18 was used by Russell in 1908 (compare to Peano&#x27;s Ɔ the inverted C); formula_19 appeared in Bourbaki in 1954.
* Equivalence: the symbol formula_26 in Frege in 1879; formula_23 in Becker in 1933 (not the first time and for this see the following); formula_25 appeared in Bourbaki in 1954; other symbols appeared punctually in the history, such as formula_66 in Gentzen, formula_6 in Schönfinkel or formula_68 in Chazal, 
* True: the symbol formula_40 comes from Boole&#x27;s interpretation of logic as an elementary algebra over the two-element Boolean algebra; other notations include formula_70 (abbreviation for the Latin word &quot;verum&quot;) to be found in Peano in 1889.
* False: the symbol formula_44 comes also from Boole&#x27;s interpretation of logic as a ring; other notations include formula_72 (rotated formula_70) to be found in Peano in 1889.

Some authors used letters for connectives: formula_74 for conjunction (German&#x27;s &quot;und&quot; for &quot;and&quot;) and formula_75 for disjunction (German&#x27;s &quot;oder&quot; for &quot;or&quot;) in early works by Hilbert (1904); formula_76 for negation, formula_77 for conjunction, formula_78 for alternative denial, formula_79 for disjunction, formula_80 for implication, formula_81 for biconditional in Łukasiewicz in 1929.

===Redundancy===

Such a logical connective as converse implication &quot;formula_82&quot; is actually the same as material conditional with swapped arguments; thus, the symbol for converse implication is redundant. In some logical calculi (notably, in classical logic), certain essentially different compound statements are logically equivalent. A less trivial example of a redundancy is the classical equivalence between formula_83 and formula_84. Therefore, a classical-based logical system does not need the conditional operator &quot;formula_17&quot; if &quot;formula_5&quot; (not) and &quot;formula_14&quot; (or) are already in use, or may use the &quot;formula_17&quot; only as a syntactic sugar for a compound having one negation and one disjunction.

There are sixteen Boolean functions associating the input truth values formula_31 and formula_32 with four-digit binary outputs. These correspond to possible choices of binary logical connectives for classical logic. Different implementations of classical logic can choose different functionally complete subsets of connectives.

One approach is to choose a &quot;minimal&quot; set, and define other connectives by some logical form, as in the example with the material conditional above.
The following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators in classical logic whose arities do not exceed 2:
;One element: formula_91, formula_92.
;Two elements: formula_93, formula_94, formula_95, formula_96, formula_97, formula_98, formula_99, formula_100, formula_101, formula_102, formula_103, formula_104, formula_105, formula_106, formula_107, formula_108, formula_109, formula_110.
;Three elements: formula_111, formula_112, formula_113, formula_114, formula_115, formula_116.

Another approach is to use with equal rights connectives of a certain convenient and functionally complete, but &quot;not minimal&quot; set. This approach requires more propositional axioms, and each equivalence between logical forms must be either an axiom or provable as a theorem.

The situation, however, is more complicated in intuitionistic logic. Of its five connectives, {∧, ∨, →, ¬, ⊥}, only negation &quot;¬&quot; can be reduced to other connectives (see for more). Neither conjunction, disjunction, nor material conditional has an equivalent form constructed from the other four logical connectives.

==Natural language==

The standard logical connectives of classical logic have rough equivalents in the grammars of natural languages. In English, as in many languages, such expressions are typically grammatical conjunctions. However, they can also take the form of complementizers, verb suffixes, and particles. The denotations of natural language connectives is a major topic of research in formal semantics, a field that studies the logical structure of natural languages.

The meanings of natural language connectives are not precisely identical to their nearest equivalents in classical logic. In particular, disjunction can receive an exclusive interpretation in many languages. Some researchers have taken this fact as evidence that natural language semantics is nonclassical. However, others maintain classical semantics by positing pragmatic accounts of exclusivity which create the illusion of nonclassicality. In such accounts, exclusivity is typically treated as a scalar implicature. Related puzzles involving disjunction include free choice inferences, Hurford&#x27;s Constraint, and the contribution of disjunction in alternative questions.

Other apparent discrepancies between natural language and classical logic include the paradoxes of material implication, donkey anaphora and the problem of counterfactual conditionals. These phenomena have been taken as motivation for identifying the denotations of natural language conditionals with logical operators including the strict conditional, the variably strict conditional, as well as various dynamic operators.

The following table shows the standard classically definable approximations for the English connectives.

==Properties==
Some logical connectives possess properties that may be expressed in the theorems containing the connective. Some of those properties that a logical connective may have are:

; Associativity: Within an expression containing two or more of the same associative connectives in a row, the order of the operations does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.
; Commutativity:The operands of the connective may be swapped, preserving logical equivalence to the original expression.
; Distributivity: A connective denoted by · distributes over another connective denoted by +, if for all operands , , .
; Idempotence: Whenever the operands of the operation are the same, the compound is logically equivalent to the operand.
; Absorption: A pair of connectives ∧, ∨ satisfies the absorption law if formula_117 for all operands , .
; Monotonicity: If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;1, ..., &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for all &quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;b&quot;1, ..., &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; ∈ {0,1} such that &quot;a&quot;1 ≤ &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2 ≤ &quot;b&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;. E.g., ∨, ∧, ⊤, ⊥.
; Affinity: Each variable always makes a difference in the truth-value of the operation or it never makes a difference. E.g., ¬, ↔, formula_118, ⊤, ⊥.
; Duality: To read the truth-value assignments for the operation from top to bottom on its truth table is the same as taking the complement of reading the table of the same or another connective from bottom to top. Without resorting to truth tables it may be formulated as . E.g., ¬.
; Truth-preserving: The compound all those arguments are tautologies is a tautology itself. E.g., ∨, ∧, ⊤, →, ↔, ⊂ (see validity).
; Falsehood-preserving: The compound all those argument are contradictions is a contradiction itself. E.g., ∨, ∧, formula_118, ⊥, ⊄, ⊅ (see validity).
; Involutivity (for unary connectives): . E.g. negation in classical logic.

For classical and intuitionistic logic, the &quot;=&quot; symbol means that corresponding implications &quot;...→...&quot; and &quot;...←...&quot; for logical compounds can be both proved as theorems, and the &quot;≤&quot; symbol means that &quot;...→...&quot; for logical compounds is a consequence of corresponding &quot;...→...&quot; connectives for propositional variables. Some many-valued logics may have incompatible definitions of equivalence and order (entailment).

Both conjunction and disjunction are associative, commutative and idempotent in classical logic, most varieties of many-valued logic and intuitionistic logic. The same is true about distributivity of conjunction over disjunction and disjunction over conjunction, as well as for the absorption law.

In classical logic and some varieties of many-valued logic, conjunction and disjunction are dual, and negation is self-dual, the latter is also self-dual in intuitionistic logic. 

==Order of precedence==
As a way of reducing the number of necessary parentheses, one may introduce precedence rules: ¬ has higher precedence than ∧, ∧ higher than ∨, and ∨ higher than →. So for example, formula_120 is short for formula_121.

Here is a table that shows a commonly used precedence of logical operators.

However, not all compilers use the same order; for instance, an ordering in which disjunction is lower precedence than implication or bi-implication has also been used. Sometimes precedence between conjunction and disjunction is unspecified requiring to provide it explicitly in given formula with parentheses. The order of precedence determines which connective is the &quot;main connective&quot; when interpreting a non-atomic formula.

==Table and Hasse diagram==

The 16 logical connectives can be partially ordered to produce the following Hasse diagram. 
The partial order is defined by declaring that formula_122 if and only if whenever formula_123 holds then so does formula_124 

==Applications==
Logical connectives are used in computer science and in set theory.

===Computer science===

A truth-functional approach to logical operators is implemented as logic gates in digital circuits. Practically all digital circuits (the major exception is DRAM) are built up from NAND, NOR, NOT, and transmission gates; see more details in Truth function in computer science. Logical operators over bit vectors (corresponding to finite Boolean algebras) are bitwise operations.

But not every usage of a logical connective in computer programming has a Boolean semantic. For example, lazy evaluation is sometimes implemented for and , so these connectives are not commutative if either or both of the expressions , have side effects. Also, a conditional, which in some sense corresponds to the material conditional connective, is essentially non-Boolean because for codice_1, the consequent Q is not executed if the antecedent P is false (although a compound as a whole is successful ≈ &quot;true&quot; in such case). This is closer to intuitionist and constructivist views on the material conditional— rather than to classical logic&#x27;s views.

===Set theory===

Logical connectives are used to define the fundamental operations of set theory, as follows:
This definition of set equality is equivalent to the axiom of extensionality.

<text>The propositional calculus is a branch of logic. It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. Sometimes, it is called &quot;first-order&quot; propositional logic to contrast it with System F, but it should not be confused with first-order logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives representing the truth functions of conjunction, disjunction, implication, biconditional, and negation. Some sources include other connectives, as in the table below.

Unlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.

Propositional logic is typically studied with a formal language, in which propositions are represented by letters, which are called &quot;propositional variables&quot;. These are then used, together with symbols for connectives, to make &quot;propositional formula&quot;. Because of this, the propositional variables are called &quot;atomic formulas&quot; of a formal propositional language. While the atomic propositions are typically represented by letters of the alphabet, there is a variety of notations to represent the logical connectives. The following table shows the main notational variants for each of the connectives in propositional logic.

The most thoroughly researched branch of propositional logic is classical truth-functional propositional logic, in which formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible truth values, the truth value of &quot;true&quot; or the truth value of &quot;false&quot;. The principle of bivalence and the law of excluded middle are upheld. By comparison with first-order logic, truth-functional propositional logic is considered to be &quot;zeroth-order logic&quot;.

== History ==

Although propositional logic (also called propositional calculus) had been hinted by earlier philosophers, it was developed into a formal logic (Stoic logic) by Chrysippus in the 3rd century BC and expanded by his successor Stoics. The logic was focused on propositions. This was different from the traditional syllogistic logic, which focused on terms. However, most of the original writings were lost and, at some time between the 3rd and 6th century CE, Stoic logic faded into oblivion, to be resurrected only in the 20th century, in the wake of the (re)-discovery of propositional logic.

Symbolic logic, which would come to be important to refine propositional logic, was first developed by the 17th/18th-century mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, whose calculus ratiocinator was, however, unknown to the larger logical community. Consequently, many of the advances achieved by Leibniz were recreated by logicians like George Boole and Augustus De Morgan, completely independent of Leibniz.

Gottlob Frege&#x27;s predicate logic builds upon propositional logic, and has been described as combining &quot;the distinctive features of syllogistic logic and propositional logic.&quot; Consequently, predicate logic ushered in a new era in logic&#x27;s history; however, advances in propositional logic were still made after Frege, including natural deduction, truth trees and truth tables. Natural deduction was invented by Gerhard Gentzen and Stanisław Jaśkowski. Truth trees were invented by Evert Willem Beth. The invention of truth tables, however, is of uncertain attribution.

Within works by Frege and Bertrand Russell, are ideas influential to the invention of truth tables. The actual tabular structure (being formatted as a table), itself, is generally credited to either Ludwig Wittgenstein or Emil Post (or both, independently). Besides Frege and Russell, others credited with having ideas preceding truth tables include Philo, Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Ernst Schröder. Others credited with the tabular structure include Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred North Whitehead, William Stanley Jevons, John Venn, and Clarence Irving Lewis. Ultimately, some have concluded, like John Shosky, that &quot;It is far from clear that any one person should be given the title of &#x27;inventor&#x27; of truth-tables&quot;.

Propositional logic, as currently studied in universities, is a specification of a standard of logical consequence in which only the meanings of propositional connectives are considered in evaluating the conditions for the truth of a sentence, or whether a sentence logically follows from some other sentence or group of sentences.

=== Declarative sentences ===
Propositional logic deals with statements, which are defined as declarative sentences having truth value. Examples of statements might include:

* &quot;Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit.&quot;
* &quot;London is the capital of England.&quot;
* &quot;All Wikipedia editors speak at least three languages.&quot;
Declarative sentences are contrasted with questions, such as &quot;What is Wikipedia?&quot;, and imperative statements, such as &quot;Please add citations to support the claims in this article.&quot;. Such non-declarative sentences have no truth value, and are only dealt with in nonclassical logics, called erotetic and imperative logics.

=== Compounding sentences with connectives ===

In propositional logic, a statement can contain one or more other statements as parts. &quot;Compound sentences&quot; are formed from simpler sentences and express relationships among the constituent sentences. This is done by combining them with logical connectives: the main types of compound sentences are negations, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications, and biconditionals, which are formed by using the corresponding connectives to connect propositions. In English, these connectives are expressed by the words &quot;and&quot; (conjunction), &quot;or&quot; (disjunction), &quot;not&quot; (negation), &quot;if&quot; (material conditional), and &quot;if and only if&quot; (biconditional). Examples of such compound sentences might include:

* &quot;Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions .&quot; (conjunction)
* &quot;It is not true that all Wikipedia editors speak at least three languages.&quot; (negation)
* Either London is the capital of England, or London is the capital of the United Kingdom, or both. (disjunction)

If sentences lack any logical connectives, they are called &quot;simple sentences&quot;, or &quot;atomic sentences&quot;; if they contain one or more logical connectives, they are called &quot;compound sentences&quot;, or &quot;molecular sentences&quot;.

&quot;Sentential connectives&quot; are a broader category that includes logical connectives. Sentential connectives are any linguistic particles that bind sentences to create a new compound sentence, or that inflect a single sentence to create a new sentence. A &quot;logical connective&quot;, or &quot;propositional connective&quot;, is a kind of sentential connective with the characteristic feature that, when the original sentences it operates on are (or express) propositions, the new sentence that results from its application also is (or expresses) a proposition. Philosophers disagree about what exactly a proposition is, as well as about which sentential connectives in natural languages should be counted as logical connectives. Sentential connectives are also called &quot;sentence-functors&quot;, and logical connectives are also called &quot;truth-functors&quot;.

== Arguments ==

An argument is defined as a pair of things, namely a set of sentences, called the premises, and a sentence, called the conclusion. The conclusion is claimed to &quot;follow from&quot; the premises, and the premises are claimed to &quot;support&quot; the conclusion.

=== Example argument ===
The following is an example of an argument within the scope of propositional logic:

:Premise 1: &quot;If&quot; it&#x27;s raining, &quot;then&quot; it&#x27;s cloudy.
:Premise 2: It&#x27;s raining.
:Conclusion: It&#x27;s cloudy.

The logical form of this argument is known as modus ponens, which is a classically valid form. So, in classical logic, the argument is &quot;valid&quot;, although it may or may not be &quot;sound&quot;, depending on the meteorological facts in a given context. This example argument will be reused when explaining .

=== Validity and soundness ===

An argument is valid if, and only if, it is &quot;necessary&quot; that, if all its premises are true, its conclusion is true. Alternatively, an argument is valid if, and only if, it is &quot;impossible&quot; for all the premises to be true while the conclusion is false.

Validity is contrasted with &quot;soundness&quot;. An argument is sound if, and only if, it is valid and all its premises are true. Otherwise, it is &quot;unsound&quot;.

Logic, in general, aims to precisely specify valid arguments. This is done by defining a valid argument as one in which its conclusion is a logical consequence of its premises, which, when this is understood as &quot;semantic consequence&quot;, means that there is no &quot;case&quot; in which the premises are true but the conclusion is not true – see below.

== Formalization ==
Propositional logic is typically studied through a formal system in which formulas of a formal language are interpreted to represent propositions. This formal language is the basis for proof systems, which allow a conclusion to be derived from premises if, and only if, it is a logical consequence of them. This section will show how this works by formalizing the . The formal language for a propositional calculus will be fully specified in , and an overview of proof systems will be given in .

=== Propositional variables ===

Since propositional logic is not concerned with the structure of propositions beyond the point where they cannot be decomposed any more by logical connectives, it is typically studied by replacing such &quot;atomic&quot; (indivisible) statements with letters of the alphabet, which are interpreted as variables representing statements (&quot;propositional variables&quot;). With propositional variables, the would then be symbolized as follows:

:Premise 1: formula_1
:Premise 2: formula_2
:Conclusion: formula_3

When is interpreted as &quot;It&#x27;s raining&quot; and as &quot;it&#x27;s cloudy&quot; these symbolic expressions correspond exactly with the original expression in natural language. Not only that, but they will also correspond with any other inference with the same logical form.

When a formal system is used to represent formal logic, only statement letters (usually capital roman letters such as formula_2, formula_3 and formula_6) are represented directly. The natural language propositions that arise when they&#x27;re interpreted are outside the scope of the system, and the relation between the formal system and its interpretation is likewise outside the formal system itself.

=== Gentzen notation ===
If we assume that the validity of modus ponens has been accepted as an axiom, then the same can also be depicted like this:

:formula_7

This method of displaying it is Gentzen&#x27;s notation for natural deduction and sequent calculus. The premises are shown above a line, called the inference line, separated by a comma, which indicates &quot;combination&quot; of premises. The conclusion is written below the inference line. The inference line represents &quot;syntactic consequence&quot;, sometimes called &quot;deductive consequence&quot;, which is also symbolized with ⊢. So the above can also be written in one line as formula_8.

Syntactic consequence is contrasted with &quot;semantic consequence&quot;, which is symbolized with ⊧. In this case, the conclusion follows &quot;syntactically&quot; because the natural deduction inference rule of modus ponens has been assumed. For more on inference rules, see the sections on proof systems below.

==Language==

The language (commonly called formula_9) of a propositional calculus is defined in terms of:

# a set of primitive symbols, called &quot;atomic formulas&quot;, &quot;atomic sentences&quot;, &quot;atoms,&quot; &quot;placeholders&quot;, &quot;prime formulas&quot;, &quot;proposition letters&quot;, &quot;sentence letters&quot;, or &quot;variables&quot;, and
# a set of operator symbols, called &quot;connectives&quot;, &quot;logical connectives&quot;, &quot;logical operators&quot;, &quot;truth-functional connectives,&quot; &quot;truth-functors&quot;, or &quot;propositional connectives&quot;.

A &quot;well-formed formula&quot; is any atomic formula, or any formula that can be built up from atomic formulas by means of operator symbols according to the rules of the grammar. The language formula_9, then, is defined either as being &quot;identical to&quot; its set of well-formed formulas, or as &quot;containing&quot; that set (together with, for instance, its set of connectives and variables).

Usually the syntax of formula_9 is defined recursively by just a few definitions, as seen next; some authors explicitly include &quot;parentheses&quot; as punctuation marks when defining their language&#x27;s syntax, while others use them without comment.

=== Syntax ===
Given a set of atomic propositional variables formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, ..., and a set of propositional connectives formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, ..., formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, ..., formula_21, formula_22, formula_23, ..., a formula of propositional logic is defined recursively by these definitions:

:Definition 1: Atomic propositional variables are formulas.

:Definition 2: If formula_24 is a propositional connective, and formula_25A, B, C, …formula_26 is a sequence of m, possibly but not necessarily atomic, possibly but not necessarily distinct, formulas, then the result of applying formula_24 to formula_25A, B, C, …formula_26 is a formula.
:Definition 3: Nothing else is a formula.

Writing the result of applying formula_24 to formula_25A, B, C, …formula_26 in functional notation, as formula_24(A, B, C, …), we have the following as examples of well-formed formulas:

* formula_34
* formula_35
* formula_36
* formula_37
* formula_38
* formula_39
* formula_40

What was given as &quot;Definition 2&quot; above, which is responsible for the composition of formulas, is referred to by Colin Howson as the &quot;principle of composition&quot;. It is this recursion in the definition of a language&#x27;s syntax which justifies the use of the word &quot;atomic&quot; to refer to propositional variables, since all formulas in the language formula_9 are built up from the atoms as ultimate building blocks. Composite formulas (all formulas besides atoms) are called &quot;molecules&quot;, or &quot;molecular sentences&quot;. (This is an imperfect analogy with chemistry, since a chemical molecule may sometimes have only one atom, as in monatomic gases.)

The definition that &quot;nothing else is a formula&quot;, given above as &quot;Definition 3&quot;, excludes any formula from the language which is not specifically required by the other definitions in the syntax. In particular, it excludes &quot;infinitely long&quot; formulas from being well-formed.

==== CF grammar in BNF ====
An alternative to the syntax definitions given above is to write a context-free (CF) grammar for the language formula_9 in Backus-Naur form (BNF). This is more common in computer science than in philosophy. It can be done in many ways, of which a particularly brief one, for the common set of five connectives, is this single clause:
:formula_43
This clause, due to its self-referential nature (since formula_44 is in some branches of the definition of formula_44), also acts as a recursive definition, and therefore specifies the entire language. To expand it to add modal operators, one need only add … formula_46 to the end of the clause.

=== Constants and schemata ===
Mathematicians sometimes distinguish between propositional constants, propositional variables, and schemata. &quot;Propositional constants&quot; represent some particular proposition, while &quot;propositional variables&quot; range over the set of all atomic propositions. Schemata, or &quot;schematic letters&quot;, however, range over all formulas. (Schematic letters are also called &quot;metavariables&quot;.) It is common to represent propositional constants by , , and , propositional variables by , , and , and schematic letters are often Greek letters, most often , , and .

However, some authors recognize only two &quot;propositional constants&quot; in their formal system: the special symbol formula_47, called &quot;truth&quot;, which always evaluates to &quot;True&quot;, and the special symbol formula_48, called &quot;falsity&quot;, which always evaluates to &quot;False&quot;. Other authors also include these symbols, with the same meaning, but consider them to be &quot;zero-place truth-functors&quot;, or equivalently, &quot;nullary connectives&quot;.

== Semantics ==

To serve as a model of the logic of a given natural language, a formal language must be semantically interpreted. In classical logic, all propositions evaluate to exactly one of two truth-values: &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;. For example, &quot;Wikipedia is a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit&quot; , while &quot;Wikipedia is a paper encyclopedia&quot; .

In other respects, the following formal semantics can apply to the language of any propositional logic, but the assumptions that there are only two semantic values (&quot;bivalence&quot;), that only one of the two is assigned to each formula in the language (&quot;noncontradiction&quot;), and that every formula gets assigned a value (&quot;excluded middle&quot;), are distinctive features of classical logic. To learn about nonclassical logics with more than two truth-values, and their unique semantics, one may consult the articles on &quot;Many-valued logic&quot;, &quot;Three-valued logic&quot;, &quot;Finite-valued logic&quot;, and &quot;Infinite-valued logic&quot;.

=== Interpretation (case) and argument ===

For a given language formula_9, an interpretation, valuation, Boolean valuation, or case, is an assignment of &quot;semantic values&quot; to each formula of formula_9. For a formal language of classical logic, a case is defined as an &quot;assignment&quot;, to each formula of formula_9, of one or the other, but not both, of the truth values, namely truth (T, or 1) and falsity (F, or 0). An interpretation that follows the rules of classical logic is sometimes called a Boolean valuation. An interpretation of a formal language for classical logic is often expressed in terms of truth tables. Since each formula is only assigned a single truth-value, an interpretation may be viewed as a function, whose domain is formula_9, and whose range is its set of semantic values formula_53, or formula_54.

For formula_55 distinct propositional symbols there are formula_56 distinct possible interpretations. For any particular symbol formula_57, for example, there are formula_58 possible interpretations: either formula_57 is assigned T, or formula_57 is assigned F. And for the pair formula_57, formula_62 there are formula_63 possible interpretations: either both are assigned T, or both are assigned F, or formula_57 is assigned T and formula_62 is assigned F, or formula_57 is assigned F and formula_62 is assigned T. Since formula_9 has formula_69, that is, denumerably many propositional symbols, there are formula_70, and therefore uncountably many distinct possible interpretations of formula_9 as a whole.

Where formula_72 is an interpretation and formula_73 and formula_74 represent formulas, the definition of an &quot;argument&quot;, given in , may then be stated as a pair formula_75, where formula_76 is the set of premises and formula_74 is the conclusion. The definition of an argument&#x27;s &quot;validity&quot;, i.e. its property that formula_78, can then be stated as its &quot;absence of a counterexample&quot;, where a counterexample is defined as a case formula_72 in which the argument&#x27;s premises formula_76 are all true but the conclusion formula_74 is not true. As will be seen in , this is the same as to say that the conclusion is a &quot;semantic consequence&quot; of the premises.

=== Propositional connective semantics ===
An interpretation assigns semantic values to atomic formulas directly. Molecular formulas are assigned a &quot;function&quot; of the value of their constituent atoms, according to the connective used; the connectives are defined in such a way that the truth-value of a sentence formed from atoms with connectives depends on the truth-values of the atoms that they&#x27;re applied to, and &quot;only&quot; on those. This assumption is referred to by Colin Howson as the assumption of the &quot;truth-functionality of the connectives&quot;.

==== Semantics via truth tables ====

Since logical connectives are defined semantically only in terms of the truth values that they take when the propositional variables that they&#x27;re applied to take either of the two possible truth values, the semantic definition of the connectives is usually represented as a truth table for each of the connectives, as seen below:

This table covers each of the main five logical connectives: conjunction (here notated ), disjunction (), implication (), biconditional () and negation, (¬&quot;p&quot;, or ¬&quot;q&quot;, as the case may be). It is sufficient for determining the semantics of each of these operators. For more truth tables for more different kinds of connectives, see the article &quot;Truth table&quot;.

==== Semantics via assignment expressions ====
Some authors (viz., all the authors cited in this subsection) write out the connective semantics using a list of statements instead of a table. In this format, where formula_82 is the interpretation of formula_73, the five connectives are defined as:

* formula_84 if, and only if, formula_85
* formula_86 if, and only if, formula_87 and formula_88
* formula_89 if, and only if, formula_87 or formula_88
* formula_92 if, and only if, it is true that, if formula_87, then formula_88
* formula_95 if, and only if, it is true that formula_87 if, and only if, formula_88
Instead of formula_82, the interpretation of formula_73 may be written out as formula_100, or, for definitions such as the above, formula_101 may be written simply as the English sentence &quot;formula_73 is given the value formula_103&quot;. Yet other authors may prefer to speak of a Tarskian model formula_104 for the language, so that instead they&#x27;ll use the notation formula_105, which is equivalent to saying formula_101, where formula_72 is the interpretation function for formula_104.

==== Connective definition methods ====
Some of these connectives may be defined in terms of others: for instance, implication, , may be defined in terms of disjunction and negation, as ; and disjunction may be defined in terms of negation and conjunction, as . In fact, a &quot;truth-functionally complete&quot; system, in the sense that all and only the classical propositional tautologies are theorems, may be derived using only disjunction and negation (as Russell, Whitehead, and Hilbert did), or using only implication and negation (as Frege did), or using only conjunction and negation, or even using only a single connective for &quot;not and&quot; (the Sheffer stroke), as Jean Nicod did. A &quot;joint denial&quot; connective (logical NOR) will also suffice, by itself, to define all other connectives. Besides NOR and NAND, no other connectives have this property.

Some authors, namely Howson and Cunningham, distinguish equivalence from the biconditional. (As to equivalence, Howson calls it &quot;truth-functional equivalence&quot;, while Cunningham calls it &quot;logical equivalence&quot;.) Equivalence is symbolized with ⇔ and is a metalanguage symbol, while a biconditional is symbolized with ↔ and is a logical connective in the object language formula_9. Regardless, an equivalence or biconditional is true if, and only if, the formulas connected by it are assigned the same semantic value under every interpretation. Other authors often do not make this distinction, and may use the word &quot;equivalence&quot;, and/or the symbol ⇔, to denote their object language&#x27;s biconditional connective.

=== Semantic truth, validity, consequence ===
Given formula_73 and formula_74 as formulas (or sentences) of a language formula_9, and formula_72 as an interpretation (or case) of formula_9, then the following definitions apply:

* Truth-in-a-case: A sentence formula_73 of formula_9 is &quot;true under an interpretation&quot; formula_72 if formula_72 assigns the truth value T to formula_73. If formula_73 is true under formula_72, then formula_72 is called a &quot;model&quot; of formula_73.
* Falsity-in-a-case: formula_73 is &quot;false under an interpretation&quot; formula_72 if, and only if, formula_126 is true under formula_72. This is the &quot;truth of negation&quot; definition of falsity-in-a-case. Falsity-in-a-case may also be defined by the &quot;complement&quot; definition: formula_73 is &quot;false under an interpretation&quot; formula_72 if, and only if, formula_73 is not true under formula_72. In classical logic, these definitions are equivalent, but in nonclassical logics, they are not.
* Semantic consequence: A sentence formula_74 of formula_9 is a &quot;semantic consequence&quot; (formula_134) of a sentence formula_73 if there is no interpretation under which formula_73 is true and formula_74 is not true.
* Valid formula (tautology): A sentence formula_73 of formula_9 is &quot;logically valid&quot; (formula_140), or a &quot;tautology&quot;, if it is true under every interpretation, or &quot;true in every case.&quot;
* Consistent sentence: A sentence of formula_9 is &quot;consistent&quot; if it is true under at least one interpretation. It is &quot;inconsistent&quot; if it is not consistent. An inconsistent formula is also called &quot;self-contradictory&quot;, and said to be a &quot;self-contradiction&quot;, or simply a &quot;contradiction&quot;, although this latter name is sometimes reserved specifically for statements of the form formula_142.

For interpretations (cases) formula_72 of formula_9, these definitions are sometimes given:

* Complete case: A case formula_72 is &quot;complete&quot; if, and only if, either formula_73 is true-in-formula_72 or formula_126 is true-in-formula_72, for any formula_73 in formula_9.
* Consistent case: A case formula_72 is &quot;consistent&quot; if, and only if, there is no formula_73 in formula_9 such that both formula_73 and formula_126 are true-in-formula_72.

For classical logic, which assumes that all cases are complete and consistent, the following theorems apply:

* For any given interpretation, a given formula is either true or false under it.
* No formula is both true and false under the same interpretation.
* formula_73 is true under formula_72 if, and only if, formula_126 is false under formula_72; formula_126 is true under formula_72 if, and only if, formula_73 is not true under formula_72.
* If formula_73 and formula_167 are both true under formula_72, then formula_74 is true under formula_72.
* If formula_140 and formula_172, then formula_173.
* formula_167 is true under formula_72 if, and only if, either formula_73 is not true under formula_72, or formula_74 is true under formula_72.
* formula_134 if, and only if, formula_167 is logically valid, that is, formula_134 if, and only if, formula_183.

==Proof systems==

Proof systems in propositional logic can be broadly classified into &quot;semantic proof systems&quot; and &quot;syntactic proof systems&quot;, according to the kind of logical consequence that they rely on: semantic proof systems rely on semantic consequence (formula_134), whereas syntactic proof systems rely on syntactic consequence (formula_185). Semantic consequence deals with the truth values of propositions in all possible interpretations, whereas syntactic consequence concerns the derivation of conclusions from premises based on rules and axioms within a formal system. This section gives a very brief overview of the kinds of proof systems, with anchors to the relevant sections of this article on each one, as well as to the separate Wikipedia articles on each one.

===Semantic proof systems===
Semantic proof systems rely on the concept of semantic consequence, symbolized as formula_134, which indicates that if formula_73 is true, then formula_74 must also be true in every possible interpretation.

====Truth tables====

A truth table is a semantic proof method used to determine the truth value of a propositional logic expression in every possible scenario. By exhaustively listing the truth values of its constituent atoms, a truth table can show whether a proposition is true, false, tautological, or contradictory. See .

====Semantic tableaux====

A semantic tableau is another semantic proof technique that systematically explores the truth of a proposition. It constructs a tree where each branch represents a possible interpretation of the propositions involved. If every branch leads to a contradiction, the original proposition is considered to be a contradiction, and its negation is considered a tautology. See .

===Syntactic proof systems===

Syntactic proof systems, in contrast, focus on the formal manipulation of symbols according to specific rules. The notion of syntactic consequence, formula_185, signifies that formula_74 can be derived from formula_73 using the rules of the formal system.

====Axiomatic systems====

An axiomatic system is a set of axioms or assumptions from which other statements (theorems) are logically derived. In propositional logic, axiomatic systems define a base set of propositions considered to be self-evidently true, and theorems are proved by applying deduction rules to these axioms. See .

====Natural deduction====

Natural deduction is a syntactic method of proof that emphasizes the derivation of conclusions from premises through the use of intuitive rules reflecting ordinary reasoning. Each rule reflects a particular logical connective and shows how it can be introduced or eliminated. See .

====Sequent calculus====

The sequent calculus is a formal system that represents logical deductions as sequences or &quot;sequents&quot; of formulas. Developed by Gerhard Gentzen, this approach focuses on the structural properties of logical deductions and provides a powerful framework for proving statements within propositional logic.

== Semantic proof via truth tables ==
Taking advantage of the semantic concept of validity (truth in every interpretation), it is possible to prove a formula&#x27;s validity by using a truth table, which gives every possible interpretation (assignment of truth values to variables) of a formula. If, and only if, all the lines of a truth table come out true, the formula is semantically valid (true in every interpretation). Further, if (and only if) formula_126 is valid, then formula_73 is inconsistent.

For instance, this table shows that &quot;&quot; is not valid:

The computation of the last column of the third line may be displayed as follows:

Further, using the theorem that formula_134 if, and only if, formula_167 is valid, we can use a truth table to prove that a formula is a semantic consequence of a set of formulas: formula_78 if, and only if, we can produce a truth table that comes out all true for the formula formula_197 (that is, if formula_198).

== Semantic proof via tableaux ==

Since truth tables have 2n lines for n variables, they can be tiresomely long for large values of n. Analytic tableaux are a more efficient, but nevertheless mechanical, semantic proof method; they take advantage of the fact that &quot;we learn nothing about the validity of the inference from examining the truth-value distributions which make either the premises false or the conclusion true: the only relevant distributions when considering deductive validity are clearly just those which make the premises true or the conclusion false.&quot;

Analytic tableaux for propositional logic are fully specified by the rules that are stated in schematic form below. These rules use &quot;signed formulas&quot;, where a signed formula is an expression formula_199 or formula_200, where formula_201 is a (unsigned) formula of the language formula_9. (Informally, formula_199 is read &quot;formula_201 is true&quot;, and formula_200 is read &quot;formula_201 is false&quot;.) Their formal semantic definition is that &quot;under any interpretation, a signed formula formula_199 is called true if formula_201 is true, and false if formula_201 is false, whereas a signed formula formula_200 is called false if formula_201 is true, and true if formula_201 is false.&quot;

formula_213

In this notation, rule 2 means that formula_214 yields both formula_215, whereas formula_216 &quot;branches&quot; into formula_217. The notation is to be understood analogously for rules 3 and 4. Often, in tableaux for classical logic, the &quot;signed formula&quot; notation is simplified so that formula_218 is written simply as formula_73, and formula_220 as formula_126, which accounts for naming rule 1 the &quot;Rule of Double Negation&quot;.

One constructs a tableau for a set of formulas by applying the rules to produce more lines and tree branches until every line has been used, producing a &quot;complete&quot; tableau. In some cases, a branch can come to contain both formula_199 and formula_200 for some formula_201, which is to say, a contradiction. In that case, the branch is said to close. If every branch in a tree closes, the tree itself is said to close. In virtue of the rules for construction of tableaux, a closed tree is a proof that the original formula, or set of formulas, used to construct it was itself self-contradictory, and therefore false. Conversely, a tableau can also prove that a logical formula is tautologous: if a formula is tautologous, its negation is a contradiction, so a tableau built from its negation will close.

To construct a tableau for an argument formula_75, one first writes out the set of premise formulas, formula_76, with one formula on each line, signed with formula_227 (that is, formula_218 for each formula_218 in the set); and together with those formulas (the order is unimportant), one also writes out the conclusion, formula_74, signed with formula_231 (that is, formula_232). One then produces a truth tree (analytic tableau) by using all those lines according to the rules. A closed tree will be proof that the argument was valid, in virtue of the fact that formula_134 if, and only if, formula_234 is inconsistent (also written as formula_235).

== List of classically valid argument forms ==
Using semantic checking methods, such as truth tables or semantic tableaux, to check for tautologies and semantic consequences, it can be shown that, in classical logic, the following classical argument forms are semantically valid, i.e., these tautologies and semantic consequences hold. We use formula_73 ⟚ formula_74 to denote equivalence of formula_73 and formula_74, that is, as an abbreviation for both formula_134 and formula_241; as an aid to reading the symbols, a description of each formula is given. The description reads the symbol ⊧ (called the &quot;double turnstile&quot;) as &quot;therefore&quot;, which is a common reading of it, although many authors prefer to read it as &quot;entails&quot;, or as &quot;models&quot;.
== Syntactic proof via natural deduction ==
Natural deduction, since it is a method of syntactical proof, is specified by providing &quot;inference rules&quot; (also called &quot;rules of proof&quot;) for a language with the typical set of connectives formula_242; no axioms are used other than these rules. The rules are covered below, and a proof example is given afterwards.

=== Notation styles ===
Different authors vary to some extent regarding which inference rules they give, which will be noted. More striking to the look and feel of a proof, however, is the variation in notation styles. The , which was covered earlier for a short argument, can actually be stacked to produce large tree-shaped natural deduction proofs—not to be confused with &quot;truth trees&quot;, which is another name for analytic tableaux. There is also a style due to Stanisław Jaśkowski, where the formulas in the proof are written inside various nested boxes, and there is a simplification of Jaśkowski&#x27;s style due to Fredric Fitch (Fitch notation), where the boxes are simplified to simple horizontal lines beneath the introductions of suppositions, and vertical lines to the left of the lines that are under the supposition. Lastly, there is the only notation style which will actually be used in this article, which is due to Patrick Suppes, but was much popularized by E.J. Lemmon and Benson Mates. This method has the advantage that, graphically, it is the least intensive to produce and display, which made it a natural choice for the editor who wrote this part of the article, who did not understand the complex LaTeX commands that would be required to produce proofs in the other methods.

A proof, then, laid out in accordance with the Suppes–Lemmon notation style, is a sequence of lines containing sentences, where each sentence is either an assumption, or the result of applying a rule of proof to earlier sentences in the sequence. Each line of proof is made up of a sentence of proof, together with its annotation, its assumption set, and the current line number. The assumption set lists the assumptions on which the given sentence of proof depends, which are referenced by the line numbers. The annotation specifies which rule of proof was applied, and to which earlier lines, to yield the current sentence. See the .

=== Inference rules ===
Natural deduction inference rules, due ultimately to Gentzen, are given below. There are ten primitive rules of proof, which are the rule &quot;assumption&quot;, plus four pairs of introduction and elimination rules for the binary connectives, and the rule &quot;reductio ad adbsurdum&quot;. Disjunctive Syllogism can be used as an easier alternative to the proper ∨-elimination, and MTT and DN are commonly given rules, although they are not primitive.

=== Natural deduction proof example ===
The proof below derives formula_243 from formula_1 and formula_245 using only MPP and RAA, which shows that MTT is not a primitive rule, since it can be derived from those two other rules.
== Syntactic proof via axioms ==

It is possible to perform proofs axiomatically, which means that certain tautologies are taken as self-evident and various others are deduced from them using modus ponens as an inference rule, as well as a &quot;rule of substitution&quot;, which permits replacing any well-formed formula with any of it. Alternatively, one uses axiom schemas instead of axioms, and no rule of substitution is used.

This section gives the axioms of some historically notable axiomatic systems for propositional logic. For more examples, as well as metalogical theorems that are specific to such axiomatic systems (such as their completeness and consistency), see the article Axiomatic system (logic).

=== Frege&#x27;s &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; ===
Although axiomatic proof has been used since the famous Ancient Greek textbook, Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot;, in propositional logic it dates back to Gottlob Frege&#x27;s 1879 &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot;. Frege&#x27;s system used only implication and negation as connectives, and it had six axioms, which were these ones:

* Proposition 1: formula_246
* Proposition 2: formula_247
* Proposition 8: formula_248
* Proposition 28: formula_249
* Proposition 31: formula_250
* Proposition 41: formula_251

These were used by Frege together with modus ponens and a rule of substitution (which was used but never precisely stated) to yield a complete and consistent axiomatization of classical truth-functional propositional logic.

=== Łukasiewicz&#x27;s P2 ===
Jan Łukasiewicz showed that, in Frege&#x27;s system, &quot;the third axiom is superfluous since it can be derived from the preceding two axioms, and that the last three axioms can be replaced by the single sentence formula_252&quot;. Which, taken out of Łukasiewicz&#x27;s Polish notation into modern notation, means formula_253. Hence, Łukasiewicz is credited with this system of three axioms:

* formula_254
* formula_255
* formula_256

Just like Frege&#x27;s system, this system uses a substitution rule and uses modus ponens as an inference rule. The exact same system was given (with an explicit substitution rule) by Alonzo Church, who referred to it as the system P2 and helped popularize it.

==== Schematic form of P2 ====
One may avoid using the rule of substitution by giving the axioms in schematic form, using them to generate an infinite set of axioms. Hence, using Greek letters to represent schemata (metalogical variables that may stand for any well-formed formulas), the axioms are given as:

* formula_257
* formula_258
* formula_259

The schematic version of P2 is attributed to John von Neumann, and is used in the Metamath &quot;set.mm&quot; formal proof database. It has also been attributed to Hilbert, and named formula_260 in this context.

====Proof example in P2====
As an example, a proof of formula_261 in P2 is given below. First, the axioms are given names:
:(A1) formula_262
:(A2) formula_263
:(A3) formula_264

And the proof is as follows:
# formula_265       (instance of (A1))
# formula_266       (instance of (A2))
# formula_267       (from (1) and (2) by modus ponens)
# formula_268       (instance of (A1))
# formula_261       (from (4) and (3) by modus ponens)

==Solvers==
One notable difference between propositional calculus and predicate calculus is that satisfiability of a propositional formula is decidable. Deciding satisfiability of propositional logic formulas is an NP-complete problem. However, practical methods exist (e.g., DPLL algorithm, 1962; Chaff algorithm, 2001) that are very fast for many useful cases. Recent work has extended the SAT solver algorithms to work with propositions containing arithmetic expressions; these are the SMT solvers.

<doc id="18155" wikidata="Q573952" url="?curid=18155" title="Lazy evaluation">
<text>In programming language theory, lazy evaluation, or call-by-need, is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which avoids repeated evaluations (by the use of sharing).

The benefits of lazy evaluation include: 
* The ability to define control flow (structures) as abstractions instead of primitives.
* The ability to define potentially infinite data structures. This allows for more straightforward implementation of some algorithms.
* The ability to define partly-defined data structures where some elements are errors. This allows for rapid prototyping.

Lazy evaluation is often combined with memoization, as described in Jon Bentley&#x27;s &quot;Writing Efficient Programs&quot;. After a function&#x27;s value is computed for that parameter or set of parameters, the result is stored in a lookup table that is indexed by the values of those parameters; the next time the function is called, the table is consulted to determine whether the result for that combination of parameter values is already available. If so, the stored result is simply returned. If not, the function is evaluated, and another entry is added to the lookup table for reuse.

Lazy evaluation is difficult to combine with imperative features such as exception handling and input/output, because the order of operations becomes indeterminate.

The opposite of lazy evaluation is eager evaluation, sometimes known as strict evaluation. Eager evaluation is the evaluation strategy employed in most programming languages.

== History ==
Lazy evaluation was introduced for lambda calculus by Christopher Wadsworth. For programming languages, it was independently introduced by Peter Henderson and James H. Morris and by Daniel P. Friedman and David S. Wise.

== Applications ==
Delayed evaluation is used particularly in functional programming languages. When using delayed evaluation, an expression is not evaluated as soon as it gets bound to a variable, but when the evaluator is forced to produce the expression&#x27;s value. That is, a statement such as codice_1 (i.e. the assignment of the result of an expression to a variable) clearly calls for the expression to be evaluated and the result placed in codice_2, but what actually is in codice_2 is irrelevant until there is a need for its value via a reference to codice_2 in some later expression whose evaluation could itself be deferred, though eventually the rapidly growing tree of dependencies would be pruned to produce some symbol rather than another for the outside world to see.

===Control structures===

Lazy evaluation allows control structures to be defined normally, and not as primitives or compile-time techniques. For example, one can define if-then-else and short-circuit evaluation operators:
ifThenElse True b c = b
ifThenElse False b c = c

-- or
True || b = True
False || b = b

-- and
True &amp;&amp; b = b
False &amp;&amp; b = False
These have the usual semantics, i.e., evaluates (a), then if and only if (a) evaluates to true does it evaluate (b), otherwise it evaluates (c). That is, exactly one of (b) or (c) will be evaluated. Similarly, for , if the easy part gives True the lots of work expression could be avoided. Finally, when evaluating , if &quot;SafeToTry&quot; is false there will be no attempt at evaluating the &quot;Expression&quot;.

Conversely, in an eager language the above definition for would evaluate (a), (b), and (c) regardless of the value of (a). This is not the desired behavior, as (b) or (c) may have side effects, take a long time to compute, or throw errors. It is usually possible to introduce user-defined lazy control structures in eager languages as functions, though they may depart from the language&#x27;s syntax for eager evaluation: Often the involved code bodies need to be wrapped in a function value, so that they are executed only when called.

=== Working with infinite data structures ===
Delayed evaluation has the advantage of being able to create calculable infinite lists without infinite loops or size matters interfering in computation. The actual values are only computed when needed. For example, one could create a function that creates an infinite list (often called a &quot;stream&quot;) of Fibonacci numbers. The calculation of the &quot;n&quot;-th Fibonacci number would be merely the extraction of that element from the infinite list, forcing the evaluation of only the first n members of the list.

Take for example this trivial program in Haskell:
numberFromInfiniteList :: Int -&gt; Int
numberFromInfiniteList n = infinity !! n - 1
 where infinity = [1..]

main = print $ numberFromInfiniteList 4
In the function , the value of is an infinite range, but until an actual value (or more specifically, a specific value at a certain index) is needed, the list is not evaluated, and even then, it is only evaluated as needed (that is, until the desired index.) Provided the programmer is careful, the program completes normally. However, certain calculations may result in the program attempting to evaluate an infinite number of elements; for example, requesting the length of the list or trying to sum the elements of the list with a fold operation would result in the program either failing to terminate or running out of memory.

As another example, the list of all Fibonacci numbers can be written in the programming language Haskell as:
 fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
In Haskell syntax, &quot;codice_5&quot; prepends an element to a list, codice_6 returns a list without its first element, and codice_7 uses a specified function (in this case addition) to combine corresponding elements of two lists to produce a third.

=== List-of-successes pattern ===
===Other uses===
In computer windowing systems, the painting of information to the screen is driven by &quot;expose events&quot; which drive the display code at the last possible moment. By doing this, windowing systems avoid computing unnecessary display content updates.

Another example of laziness in modern computer systems is copy-on-write page allocation or demand paging, where memory is allocated only when a value stored in that memory is changed.

Laziness can be useful for high performance scenarios. An example is the Unix mmap function, which provides &quot;demand driven&quot; loading of pages from disk, so that only those pages actually touched are loaded into memory, and unneeded memory is not allocated.

MATLAB implements &quot;copy on edit&quot;, where arrays which are copied have their actual memory storage replicated only when their content is changed, possibly leading to an &quot;out of memory&quot; error when updating an element afterwards instead of during the copy operation.

==Performance==
The number of beta reductions to reduce a lambda term with call-by-need is no larger than the number needed by call-by-value or call-by-name reduction. And with certain programs the number of steps may be much smaller, for example a specific family of lambda terms using Church numerals take an infinite amount of steps with call-by-value (i.e. never complete), an exponential number of steps with call-by-name, but only a polynomial number with call-by-need. Call-by-need embodies two optimizations - never repeat work (similar to call-by-value), and never perform unnecessary work (similar to call-by-name). 
Lazy evaluation can also lead to reduction in memory footprint, since values are created when needed.

In practice, lazy evaluation may cause significant performance issues compared to eager evaluation. For example, on modern computer architectures, delaying a computation and performing it later is slower than performing it immediately. This can be alleviated through strictness analysis. Lazy evaluation can also introduce memory leaks due to unevaluated expressions.

==Implementation==
Some programming languages delay evaluation of expressions by default, and some others provide functions or special syntax to delay evaluation. In Miranda and Haskell, evaluation of function arguments is delayed by default. In many other languages, evaluation can be delayed by explicitly suspending the computation using special syntax (as with Scheme&#x27;s &quot;codice_8&quot; and &quot;codice_9&quot; and OCaml&#x27;s &quot;codice_10&quot; and &quot;codice_11&quot;) or, more generally, by wrapping the expression in a thunk. The object representing such an explicitly delayed evaluation is called a &quot;lazy future.&quot; Raku uses lazy evaluation of lists, so one can assign infinite lists to variables and use them as arguments to functions, but unlike Haskell and Miranda, Raku does not use lazy evaluation of arithmetic operators and functions by default.

== Laziness and eagerness ==
===Controlling eagerness in lazy languages===
In lazy programming languages such as Haskell, although the default is to evaluate expressions only when they are demanded, it is possible in some cases to make code more eager—or conversely, to make it more lazy again after it has been made more eager. This can be done by explicitly coding something which forces evaluation (which may make the code more eager) or avoiding such code (which may make the code more lazy). &quot;Strict&quot; evaluation usually implies eagerness, but they are technically different concepts.

However, there is an optimisation implemented in some compilers called strictness analysis, which, in some cases, allows the compiler to infer that a value will always be used. In such cases, this may render the programmer&#x27;s choice of whether to force that particular value or not, irrelevant, because strictness analysis will force strict evaluation.

In Haskell, marking constructor fields strict means that their values will always be demanded immediately. The codice_12 function can also be used to demand a value immediately and then pass it on, which is useful if a constructor field should generally be lazy. However, neither of these techniques implements &quot;recursive&quot; strictness—for that, a function called codice_13 was invented.

Also, pattern matching in Haskell 98 is strict by default, so the codice_14 qualifier has to be used to make it lazy.

=== Simulating laziness in eager languages ===
====Java====
In Java, lazy evaluation can be done by using objects that have a method to evaluate them when the value is needed. The body of this method must contain the code required to perform this evaluation. Since the introduction of lambda expressions in Java SE8, Java has supported a compact notation for this. The following example generic interface provides a framework for lazy evaluation:

interface Lazy&lt;T&gt; {
 T eval();


The codice_15 interface with its codice_16 method is equivalent to the codice_17 interface with its codice_18 method in the codice_19 library.

Each class that implements the codice_15 interface must provide an codice_21 method, and instances of the class may carry whatever values the method needs to accomplish lazy evaluation. For example, consider the following code to lazily compute and print 210:

Lazy&lt;Integer&gt; a = () -&gt; 1;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
 Lazy&lt;Integer&gt; b = a;
 a = () -&gt; b.eval() + b.eval();
System.out.println(&quot;a = &quot; + a.eval());
In the above, the variable initially refers to a lazy integer object created by the lambda expression codice_22. Evaluating this lambda expression is similar to constructing a new instance of an anonymous class that implements codice_23 with an method returning .

Each iteration of the loop links to a new object created by evaluating the lambda expression inside the loop. Each of these objects holds a reference to another lazy object, , and has an method that calls codice_24 twice and returns the sum. The variable is needed here to meet Java&#x27;s requirement that variables referenced from within a lambda expression be effectively final.

This is an inefficient program because this implementation of lazy integers does not memoize the result of previous calls to . It also involves considerable autoboxing and unboxing. What may not be obvious is that, at the end of the loop, the program has constructed a linked list of 11 objects and that all of the actual additions involved in computing the result are done in response to the call to codice_25 on the final line of code. This call recursively traverses the list to perform the necessary additions.

We can build a Java class that memoizes a lazy object as follows:

class Memo&lt;T&gt; implements Lazy&lt;T&gt; {
 private Lazy&lt;T&gt; lazy; // a lazy expression, eval sets it to null
 private T memo; // the memorandum of the previous value

 public Memo(Lazy&lt;T&gt; lazy) {
 this.lazy = lazy;

 public T eval() {
 if (lazy != null) {
 memo = lazy.eval();
 lazy = null;
 return memo;
}
This allows the previous example to be rewritten to be far more efficient. Where the original ran in time exponential in the number of iterations, the memoized version runs in linear time:

Lazy&lt;Integer&gt; a = () -&gt; 1;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
 Lazy&lt;Integer&gt; b = a;
 a = new Memo&lt;Integer&gt;(() -&gt; b.eval() + b.eval());
System.out.println(&quot;a = &quot; + a.eval());
Java&#x27;s lambda expressions are just syntactic sugar. Anything that can be written with a lambda expression can be rewritten as a call to construct an instance of an anonymous inner class implementing the interface, and any use of an anonymous inner class can be rewritten using a named inner class, and any named inner class can be moved to the outermost nesting level.

====JavaScript====
In JavaScript, lazy evaluation can be simulated by using a generator. For example, the stream of all Fibonacci numbers can be written, using memoization, as:
 * Generator functions return generator objects, which reify lazy evaluation.
 * @return {!Generator&lt;bigint&gt;} A non-null generator of integers.
function* fibonacciNumbers() {
 let memo = [1n, -1n]; // create the initial state (e.g. a vector of &quot;negafibonacci&quot; numbers)
 while (true) { // repeat indefinitely
 memo = [memo[0] + memo[1], memo[0]]; // update the state on each evaluation
 yield memo[0]; // yield the next value and suspend execution until resumed
}

let stream = fibonacciNumbers(); // create a lazy evaluated stream of numbers
let first10 = Array.from(new Array(10), () =&gt; stream.next().value); // evaluate only the first 10 numbers
console.log(first10); // the output is [0n, 1n, 1n, 2n, 3n, 5n, 8n, 13n, 21n, 34n]
====Python====
In Python 2.x the codice_26 function computes a list of integers. The entire list is stored in memory when the first assignment statement is evaluated, so this is an example of eager or immediate evaluation:

»&gt; r = range(10)
»&gt; print r
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
»&gt; print r[3]
3
In Python 3.x the codice_26 function returns a generator which computes elements of the list on demand. Elements are only generated when they are needed (e.g., when codice_28 is evaluated in the following example), so this is an example of lazy or deferred evaluation:
»&gt; r = range(10)
»&gt; print(r)
range(0, 10)
»&gt; print(r[3])
3

:This change to lazy evaluation saves execution time for large ranges which may never be fully referenced and memory usage for large ranges where only one or a few elements are needed at any time.

In Python 2.x is possible to use a function called codice_29 which returns an object that generates the numbers in the range on demand. The advantage of codice_30 is that generated object will always take the same amount of memory.
»&gt; r = xrange(10)
»&gt; print(r)
xrange(10)
»&gt; lst = [x for x in r]
»&gt; print(lst)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
From version 2.2 forward, Python manifests lazy evaluation by implementing iterators (lazy sequences) unlike tuple or list sequences. For instance (Python 2):

»&gt; numbers = range(10)
»&gt; iterator = iter(numbers)
»&gt; print numbers
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
»&gt; print iterator
&lt;listiterator object at 0xf7e8dd4c&gt;
»&gt; print iterator.next()
0

:The above example shows that lists are evaluated when called, but in case of iterator, the first element &#x27;0&#x27; is printed when need arises.

====.NET ====
In the .NET framework, it is possible to do lazy evaluation using the class System.Lazy&lt;T&gt;. The class can be easily exploited in F# using the lazy keyword, while the force method will force the evaluation. There are also specialized collections like Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.Seq that provide built-in support for lazy evaluation. 

let fibonacci = Seq.unfold (fun (x, y) -&gt; Some(x, (y, x + y))) (0I,1I)
fibonacci |&gt; Seq.nth 1000

In C# and VB.NET, the class System.Lazy&lt;T&gt; is directly used. 

public int Sum()
 int a = 0;
 int b = 0; 
 Lazy&lt;int&gt; x = new Lazy&lt;int&gt;(() =&gt; a + b);
 a = 3;
 b = 5;
 return x.Value; // returns 8

Or with a more practical example: 

// recursive calculation of the n&#x27;th fibonacci number
public int Fib(int n)
 return (n == 1)? 1 : (n == 2)? 1 : Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2);

public void Main()
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Which Fibonacci number do you want to calculate?&quot;);
 int n = Int32.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); 
 Lazy&lt;int&gt; fib = new Lazy&lt;int&gt;(() =&gt; Fib(n)); // function is prepared, but not executed
 bool execute; 
 if (n &gt; 100)
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;This can take some time. Do you really want to calculate this large number? [y/n]&quot;);
 execute = (Console.ReadLine() == &quot;y&quot;); 
 else execute = true;
 if (execute) Console.WriteLine(fib.Value); // number is only calculated if needed

Another way is to use the yield keyword: 

// eager evaluation 
public IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; Fibonacci(int x)
 IList&lt;int&gt; fibs = new List&lt;int&gt;();

 int prev = -1;
 int next = 1;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)
 int sum = prev + next;
 prev = next;
 next = sum;
 fibs.Add(sum); 
 return fibs;

// lazy evaluation 
public IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; LazyFibonacci(int x)
 int prev = -1;
 int next = 1;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)
 int sum = prev + next;
 prev = next;
 next = sum;
 yield return sum;
}

This family was once broken into two subfamilies, Hapalemurinae (bamboo lemurs and the greater bamboo lemur) and Lemurinae (the rest of the family), but molecular evidence and the similarity of the scent glands have since placed the ring-tailed lemur with the bamboo lemurs and the greater bamboo lemur.

Lemur species in the genus &quot;Eulemur&quot; are known to interbreed, despite having dramatically different chromosome numbers. Red-fronted (2N=60) and collared (2N=50–52) brown lemurs were found to hybridize at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar.

== Characteristics ==

Lemurids are medium-sized arboreal primates, ranging from 32 to 56 cm in length, excluding the tail, and weighing from 0.7 to 5 kg. They have long, bushy tails and soft, woolly fur of varying coloration. The hindlegs are slightly longer than the forelegs, although not enough to hamper fully quadrupedal movement (unlike the sportive lemurs). Most species are highly agile, and regularly leap several metres between trees. They have a good sense of smell and binocular vision. Unlike most other lemurs, all but one species of lemurid (the ring-tailed lemur) lack a tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer in the eye that improves night vision. Historically among mammals, activity cycles are either strictly diurnal or nocturnal, however, these can widely vary across species. Lemur activity has in general evolved from nocturnal to diurnal. Some lemurs are also cathemeral, an activity pattern where an animal is neither strictly diurnal nor nocturnal.

Lemurids are herbivorous, eating fruit, leaves, and, in some cases, nectar. For the most part, they have the dental formula: . A lemur&#x27;s diet is one that is not restricted since their diet consists of frugivory, granivory, folivory, insectivory, omnivory, and gumnivory foods. Some Subfossil records have contributed to the knowledge of the currently extant lemurs from the Holocene by showing the changes in their dental records in habitats near human activity. This demonstrates that lemur species such as the lemur &quot;catta&quot; and the common brown lemur were forced to switch their primary diet to a group of secondary food sources.

With most lemurids, the mother gives birth to one or two young after a gestation period of between 120 and 140 days, depending on species. The ruffed lemur species are the only lemurids that have true litters, consisting of anywhere from two to six offspring. They are generally sociable animals, living in groups of up to thirty individuals in some species. In some cases, such as the ring-tailed lemur, the groups are long-lasting, with distinct dominance hierarchies, while in others, such as the common brown lemur, the membership of the groups varies from day to day, and seems to have no clear social structure.

Some of the lemur traits include low basal metabolic rate, highly seasonal breeders, adaptations to unpredictable climate and female dominance. Female dominance amongst lemurs is when the females are sexually monomorphic and have priority access to food. Lemurs live in groups of 11 to 17 animals, where females tend to stay within their natal groups and the males migrate. Male lemurs are competitive to win their mates which causes instability among the other organisms. Lemurs are able to mark their territory by using scents from local areas.

A number of lemur species are considered threatened; two species are critically endangered, one species is endangered, and five species are rated as vulnerable.

== Habitat ==

The highly seasonal dry deciduous forest of Madagascar alternates between dry and wet seasons, making it uniquely suitable for lemurs. Lemur species diversity increases as the number of tree species in an area increase and is also higher in forests that have been disturbed over undisturbed areas. Evidence from the Subfossil records show that many of the now extinct lemurs actually lived in much drier climates than the currently extant lemurs.

<doc id="18157" wikidata="Q1873176" url="?curid=18157" title="Lucent Technologies">
<text>Lucent Technologies, Inc. was an American multinational telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Murray Hill, New Jersey. It was established on September 30, 1996, through the divestiture of the former AT&amp;T Technologies business unit of AT&amp;T Corporation, which included Western Electric and Bell Labs.

Lucent was acquired by Alcatel SA on December 1, 2006, forming Alcatel-Lucent.

==Name==

Lucent means &quot;light-bearing&quot; in Latin. The name was applied for in 1996 at the time of the split from AT&amp;T.

The name was widely criticised, as the logo was to be, both internally and externally. Corporate communications and business cards included the strapline &#x27;Bell Labs Innovations&#x27; in a bid to retain the prestige of the internationally famous research lab, within a new business under an as-yet unknown name.

This same linguistic root also gives Lucifer, &quot;the light bearer&quot; (from lux, &#x27;light&#x27;, and ferre, &#x27;to bear&#x27;), who is also a character in Dante&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Inferno&quot;. Shortly after the Lucent renaming in 1996, Lucent&#x27;s Plan 9 project released a development of their work as the Inferno OS in 1997. This extended the &#x27;Lucifer&#x27; and Dante references as a series of punning names for the components of Inferno - Dis, Limbo, Charon and Styx (9P Protocol). When the rights to Inferno were sold in 2000, the company Vita Nuova Holdings was formed to represent them. This continues the Dante theme, although moving away from his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; to the poem &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;.

==Logo==
The Lucent logo, the Innovation Ring, was designed by Landor Associates, a prominent San Francisco-based branding consultancy. One source inside Lucent says that the logo is a Zen Buddhist symbol for &quot;eternal truth&quot;, the Ensō, turned 90 degrees and modified. Another source says it represents the mythic ouroboros, a snake holding its tail in its mouth. Lucent&#x27;s logo also has been said to represent constant re-creating and re-thinking. Carly Fiorina picked the logo because her mother was a painter and she rejected the sterile geometric logos of most high tech companies.

After the logo was compared in the media to the ring a coffee mug leaves on paper, a &quot;Dilbert&quot; comic strip showed Dogbert as an overpaid consultant designing a new company logo; he takes a piece of paper that his coffee cup was sitting on and calls it the &quot;Brown Ring of Quality&quot;. A telecommunication commentator referred to the logo as &quot;a big red zero&quot; and predicted financial losses.

==History==
One of the primary reasons AT&amp;T Corporation chose to spin off its equipment manufacturing business was to permit it to profit from sales to competing telecommunications providers; these customers had previously shown reluctance to purchase from a direct competitor. Bell Labs brought prestige to the new company, as well as the revenue from thousands of patents.

At the time of its spinoff, Lucent was placed under the leadership of Henry Schacht, who was brought in to oversee its transition from an arm of AT&amp;T into an independent corporation. Richard McGinn, who was serving as president and COO, succeeded Schacht as CEO in 1997 while Schacht remained chairman of the board. Lucent became a &quot;darling&quot; stock of the investment community in the late 1990s, and its split-adjusted spinoff price of $7.56/share rose to a high of $84. Its market capitalization reached a high of $258 billion, and it was at the time the most widely held company with 5.3 million shareholders.

In 1995, Carly Fiorina led corporate operations. In that capacity, she reported to Lucent chief executive Henry B. Schacht. She played a key role in planning and implementing the 1996 initial public offering of a successful stock and company launch strategy. Under her guidance, the spin-off raised 3 billion.

Later in 1996, Fiorina was appointed president of Lucent&#x27;s consumer products sector, reporting to president and chief operating officer Rich McGinn. In 1997, she was named group president for Lucent&#x27;s 19 billion global service-provider business, overseeing marketing and sales for the company&#x27;s largest customer segment. That year, Fiorina chaired a 2.5 billion joint venture between Lucent&#x27;s consumer communications and Royal Philips Electronics, under the name Philips Consumer Communications (PCC). The focus of the venture was to bring both companies to the top three in technology, distribution, and brand recognition.

Ultimately, the project struggled, and dissolved a year later after it garnered only 2% market share in mobile phones. Losses were at $500 million on sales of $2.5 billion. As a result of the failed joint venture, Philips announced the closure of one-quarter of the company&#x27;s 230 factories worldwide, and Lucent closed down its wireless handset portion of the venture. Analysts suggested that the joint venture&#x27;s failure was due to a combination of technology and management problems. Upon the end of the joint venture, PCC sent 5,000 employees back to Philips, many of which were laid off, and 8,400 employees back to Lucent.

Under Fiorina, the company added 22,000 jobs and revenues seemed to grow from 19 billion to 38 billion. However, the real cause of Lucent spurring sales under Fiorina was by lending money to their own customers. According to &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, &quot;In a neat bit of accounting magic, money from the loans began to appear on Lucent&#x27;s income statement as new revenue while the dicey debt got stashed on its balance sheet as an allegedly solid asset&quot;. Lucent&#x27;s stock price grew 10-fold.

In 1997, Lucent acquired Milpitas-based voicemail market leader Octel Communications Corporation for $1.8 billion, a move which immediately rendered the Business Systems Group profitable. The same year, Lucent acquired Livingston Enterprises Inc. for $650 million in stock. Livingston was known most for the creation of the RADIUS protocol and their PortMaster product that was used widely by dial-up internet service providers. In 1999, Lucent acquired Ascend Communications, an Alameda, California–based manufacturer of communications equipment for US$20 billion. Lucent held discussions to acquire Juniper Networks but decided instead to buy Nexabit Networks.

At the start of 2000, Lucent&#x27;s &quot;private bubble&quot; burst, while competitors like Nortel Networks and Alcatel were still going strong; it would be many months before the rest of the telecom industry bubble collapsed. Previously Lucent had 14 straight quarters where it exceeded analysts&#x27; expectations, leading to high expectations for the 15th quarter, ending Dec. 31, 1999. On January 6, 2000, Lucent made the first of a string of announcements that it had missed its quarterly estimates, as CEO Rich McGinn grimly announced that Lucent had run into special problems during that quarter—including disruptions in its optical networking business—and reported flat revenues and a big drop in profits. That caused the stock to plunge by 28%, shaving $64 billion off of the company&#x27;s market capitalization. When it was later revealed that it had used dubious accounting and sales practices to generate some of its earlier quarterly numbers, Lucent fell from grace. It was said that &quot;Rich McGinn couldn&#x27;t accept Lucent&#x27;s fall from its early triumphs.&quot; He described himself once as imposing &quot;audacious&quot; goals on his managers, believing the stretch for performance would produce dream results. Henry Schacht defended the corporate culture that McGinn created and noted that McGinn did not sell any Lucent shares while serving as CEO. In June 2000, Lucent announced it would acquire Chromartis, an Israeli maker of optical network equipment, for $4.5 billion In November 2000, the company disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had a $125 million accounting error for the third quarter of 2000, and by December 2000 it reported it had overstated its revenues for its latest quarter by nearly $700 million. Although no wrongdoing was found on his part, McGinn was forced to resign as CEO and he was replaced by Schacht on an interim basis. Subsequently, its CFO, Deborah Hopkins, left the company in May 2001 with Lucent&#x27;s stock at $9.06 whereas at the time she was hired it was at $46.82. In August 2001, Lucent shut down Chromartis.

In 2000, Lucent received the Shingo Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing at the Mount Olive, New Jersey Product Realization Center.

In 2001 there were merger discussions between Lucent and Alcatel, which would have seen Lucent acquired at its current market price without a premium; the newly combined entity would have been headquartered in Murray Hill. However, these negotiations collapsed when Schacht insisted on an equal 7–7 split of the merged company&#x27;s board of directors, while Alcatel chief executive officer Serge Tchuruk wanted 8 of the 14 board seats for Alcatel due to it being in a stronger position. The failure of the merger talks caused Lucent&#x27;s share price to collapse, and by October 2002 the stock price had bottomed at 55 cents per share.

In April 2000, Lucent sold its Consumer Products unit to VTech. In October 2000, Lucent spun off its Business Systems arm into Avaya, Inc., and in June 2002, it spun off its microelectronics division into Agere Systems. The spinoffs of enterprise networking and wireless, the industry&#x27;s key growth businesses from 2003 onward, meant that Lucent no longer had the capacity to serve this market.

Patricia Russo, formerly Lucent&#x27;s EVP of the Corporate Office who then left for Eastman Kodak to serve as COO, was named permanent chairman and CEO of Lucent in 2002, succeeding Schacht who remained on the board of directors.

Lucent was reduced to 30,500 employees, down from about 165,000 employees at its zenith. The layoffs of so many experienced employees meant that the company was in a weakened position and unable to re-establish itself when the market recovered in 2003. By early 2003, Lucent&#x27;s market value was $15.6 billion (which includes $6.8 billion of current value for two companies that Lucent had recently spun off, Avaya and Agere Systems), making the shares worth around $2.13, a far cry from its dotcom bubble peak of around $84, when Lucent was worth $258 billion.

Lucent continued to be active in the areas of telephone switching, optical, data and wireless networking.

In 2004, the SEC charged Lucent with a $25 million fine for the company&#x27;s lack of cooperation in their fraud case.

On April 2, 2006, Lucent announced a merger agreement with Alcatel, which was 1.5 times the size of Lucent. Serge Tchuruk became non-executive chairman, and Russo served as CEO of the newly merged company, Alcatel-Lucent, until they were both forced to resign at the end of 2008. The merger failed to produce the expected synergies, and there were significant write-downs of Lucent&#x27;s assets that Alcatel purchased.

==Operations==
===Divisions===
Lucent was divided into several core groups:
* Network Solutions Group served landline/cellular telephone service providers by providing equipment and other solutions necessary to provide telephone service, including networking equipment.
* Lucent Worldwide Services (LWS) provided network services to telecom companies and business; clients included AT&amp;T Corporation and Verizon. Divisions of LWS included the AT&amp;T Customer Business Unit, known as ACBU; and another group for Southwestern Bell and other Bell companies. Both divisions were responsible for the installation of telecom equipment ranging from 2-pair copper to multi-wire fiber optics. Each group also installed the first true national cellular service with LTE speeds in the 1990s. 
* Bell Labs was created in 1925 as the R&amp;D firm of the Bell System. It was an AT&amp;T subsidiary set up as dual ownership by AT&amp;T and Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of AT&amp;T.

===Murray Hill facility===
The Murray Hill facility in New Providence, New Jersey was the global headquarters for Lucent Technologies. The building has the largest copper-clad roof in the world. There was a cricket field in the grounds.
The Murray Hill anechoic chamber, built in 1940, is the world&#x27;s oldest wedge-based anechoic chamber. The interior room measures approximately high by wide by deep. The exterior concrete and brick walls are about thick to keep outside noise from entering the chamber. The chamber absorbs over 99.995% of the incident acoustic energy above 200 Hz. At one time the Murray Hill chamber was cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s quietest room. It is possible to hear the sounds of skeletal joints and heart beats very prominently.

===Mount Olive facility===
The Mount Olive Product Realization Center (MTO-PRC) facility in Mount Olive, New Jersey was part of the Wireless Networks Group business unit. The 252,000 square-feet building was constructed for AT&amp;T Corp. in 1994. The two leased buildings were located at the International Trade Center (New Jersey) and one building was used for warehousing and the other used for wireless products manufacturing since 1995. An additionally built wireless products manufacturing, PRC, was located in Piscataway, New Jersey also independently of AT&amp;T creation.

This system integration plant was a manufacturing location with the business unit under one roof. This allowed, the development, design, business functions for manufacturing cellular phone parts and between 1996 and 1999, the production of first generation CDMA (Code-division multiple access) minicells needed for cellular phone carriers. A 1,015-lb second generation Flexent Modcell cabinet was introduced in October 1999 for production as PCS (1.9 gigahertz) and TDMA (time-division multiple access) cellular (850 MHz) versions.

From 1996 to 1999, PRC achieved and reduced with this new facility the following production metrics and lean manufacturing statistics: product-development cycle time reduced over 50%, material cost reduced 43%, cost of goods by 68%, assembly productivity increased close to 150%, assembly defects reduced by 80%, manufacturing inventory reduced 70%, and 100% on-time delivery. The facility introduced several self-managed work teams called PODs (Production On Demand) to assemble and test 50 Flexent Modcells daily.

The location was also active in research and development of CDMA minicells for future global market growth and third generation W-CDMA (Wideband Code-Division Multiple Access) innovation. Expansion was evident with minicell lines for the South America market with cross-training technicians from Brazil on the product and the W-CDMA product for Japan&#x27;s cellular carrier, NTT DoCoMo.

The facility was awarded various awards and prizes for the lean manufacturing of products and excellence in work methods.

In June 2002, Lucent announced closure of the manufacturing building by the end of the year, due to the telecommunication losses in operations. Of the remaining 530 employees at the facility. 170 were employee layoffs and the other 360 employees would mostly transfer to Lucent&#x27;s Whippany, New Jersey location. The manufacturing of cell based systems would transfer to the Columbus, Ohio facility without employees. In the prior year. the warehouse building had closed for consolidation of facilities and cost reduction.

=== Notable buildings ===
During its expansion in the late 1990s, Lucent commissioned several large office buildings. The architectural firm, Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo, and Associates (KRJDA) designed five structures clad in energy-efficient, tinted, low-E glass. 
* Westminster – built between 1997 and 2001, the Westminster, Colorado building was a 480,000 ft² research and development facility for 1,350 employees. Its design is similar to the Lisle, Illinois building, with two four-story wings arranged with an entrance resembling a glass satellite dish. The building was an expansion to the existing Westminster building via pedestrian bridge. 
* Naperville – in 2000, the 600,000 ft² Naperville, Illinois five-story structure was completed for 2000 employees. It had a pedestrian bridge to the existing Indian Hill research and development building. In April 2023, the building was sold for $4.8 million by Nokia to a developer and the new ownership began demolition in August 2023 of those structures formerly called &#x27;Indian Hill New&#x27; by Lucent and Alcatel-Lucent.
* Lisle – in 2001, the Network Software Center in Lisle, Illinois was also completed in a similar design of a five-story three building with wings and two parking garages. This research and development building was a 600,000 ft² glass building for 2,000 employees. A pedestrian bridge over an existing lake linked it to the Network Software Center, built in the 1970s.

* Nuremberg – completed in 2002, the Nuremberg, Germany &quot;serpentine&quot; five-story building was a 215,000 ft² expansion for two existing buildings, with the same aesthetic design as the United States projects. It included a customer center and training area.
* Agere Hanover – the last project was completed in 2002 in Hanover Township, Allentown, Pennsylvania. The project was called the Agere Systems Expansion, which was a three-story administration, research and development building for 2,000 employees with 560,000 ft² of space. These buildings also included parking garages with about 2,000 parking spaces. The new structures were planned in 1998 by Lucent Technologies, before Agere was incorporated on August 1, 2000, and Agere was spun off by Lucent Technologies on June 1, 2002. Built at a cost of $165 million, it became the Agere world headquarters in 2003 with consolidation of offices, research and development operations from former AT&amp;T/Lucent Technologies locations at Allentown, Breinigsville, and Muhlenberg.

=== Leased locations ===
To meet customer and business needs, further locations were built and leased for Lucent, rather than built as corporate assets. At September, 1997 Lucent reported that future non-cancelable lease payments totaled $1,037 million.
* Oklahoma City – in 1997, Adevco Corp. of Norcross, Ga., built the $8 million building for a Lucent customer center to employ 400 people in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Additionally, $4 million was added to the cost for components, communications systems, and technology of the 10 year contracted lease. The location was to provide support in orders, billing, and scheduled service for over 1.5 million customers. The 57,000-square-foot building was at 14400 Hertz Quail Springs Parkway and was the largest of four customer care locations. The other three centers being opened were in Tucson, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; and Parsippany, New Jersey.
* Altamonte Springs – in 1997, an international telecommunications training center was being constructed for potentially 20,000 yearly students learning the network and computerized phone switches. The Altamonte Springs, Florida 100,000-square-foot center would have approximately 100 employees and consolidate the Northlake Boulevard Altamonte Springs training center with 20 employees. The building was located near Interstate 4 and Central Parkway, and leased from Emerson International. State and city officials gave Lucent a $348,600 four-year incentive packages to build the center at that city. The address was 240 East Central Parkway and considered as Centerpointe building. The training courses were hands-on, lab-based training of company products in data-networking, network-management, optical-networking, wireless, and wireline technologies in either international or domestic markets. The location also provided Navis Optical EMS (Element Management System) System User and Administration Training Using the GUI optical courses. The Customer Training and Information Products at Lucent Technologies facility continued to be known later as Alcatel-Lucent University upon the merger.
* Coppell – in 1998, consolidation of six office buildings, with seven business units, were planned for a new building in Coppell, Texas. A business communications systems division and various local area administration, service, and sales employees were moved to the building. The 100,000-square-foot constructed building was a two-story office building at address, 1111 Freeport Parkway. Catellus Management Corporation was the developer on the project and Compass Management &amp; Leasing was the lessor for Lucent. Lucent&#x27;s real estate costs for Carrollton and Las Colinas buildings were eliminated with this new building constructed. Also, additional buildings at the following locations were moved as planned: 1841 Hutton in Valwood, 4006 Belt Line Road, 4100 Bryan, 5429 LBJ Freeway, 5501 LBJ Freeway, and 17950 Preston Road. In 1999, Townsend Capital purchased the building and Lucent was subletting the building to Avaya.
* Highlands Ranch – in 1999, Lucent moved its regional headquarters into the recently built Highlands Ranch Business Park at Highlands Ranch, Colorado. Shea Properties constructed the center and anticipated Lucents&#x27; decision by changing the name of Highlands Ranch Boulevard to Lucent Boulevard in 1997. The address was 8740-8744 Lucent Blvd and there was 600,000 square feet of office space to consolidate 3,200 employees from 13 sites near Denver. The 37-acre campus of three white precast buildings was built by Citadel National Construction Group in 21 months and Townsend Capital, LLC was the lessor for Lucent&#x27;s project. The 8744 Lucent Blvd building was later used by Avaya.
* Miramar – in 2000, Lucent announced the Miramar, Florida, 240,000 square foot Caribbean &amp; Latin American division (CALA) regional headquarters, to be built at a cost of $40 million. Opening was expected in summer 2001 at 2400 SW 145th Avenue, to consolidate 1,200 employees from 13 South Florida locations. Clayco built and developed the four-story, V-shaped building, including two wings for Rockefeller Group Development Corporation, the lessor of the building for Lucent&#x27;s 15-year contract. About 2,500 square feet of lab space was planned for product development as part of this project. In 2002, Lucent&#x27;s technology bubble burst and it relinquished 150,000 square feet of unused space. Within 24 months, the company recovered $20 million or more from subleasing the former space to new tenants. Alcatel-Lucent continued to use the building for CALA operations after the Lucent merger.

=== International locations ===
* Bangalore - in 1997, Bell Labs R&amp;D was opened in Bangalore, India and after four years of operation, Lucent announced the closure of Bell Labs in India. In August 2001, during the announcement, up to 500 employees were at Bangalore and Hyderabad locations. Lucent planned a $2 billion improvement in capital with restructuring on a global plan. On July 9, 2000, a year earlier, Lucent had hired five Indian teenagers Bangalore jobs as they were considered, the “best and brightest minds” of Chennai and Bangalore.
* Singapore – in 1998, an $8 million education and training center was planned for the Asia Pacific region. The Singapore location would have 20,000 square feet of space with allocation of about 5,000 square feet of lab and equipment areas. The ten classrooms were for training customers on telecommunications services and products.
* Madrid – in 2000, the microelectronics unit of Lucent Technologies located at Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain was ending production of integrated circuits under Agere. The facility was installed by AT&amp;T in 1987 and became Lucent in 1996. During Lucent&#x27;s creation of Agere as a subsidiary, the facility became Agere and was later acquired by BP Solar to manufacture photovoltaic panels. Lucent sold the facility in restructuring efforts to reduce staff and reduce the value of manufacturing assets. The location was called Lucent Technologies Madrid or Tres Cantos. Although the facility had a record of turnover production in November 2000 of 180 million euros and 18 million euros in income, it sold after June 2001 to BP due to not exceeding 25% production demand.

* Hyderabad - in 2001, Lucent announced the closure of Bell Labs in India at the Bangalore and Hyderabad, India R&amp;D locations.
* Gurgaon - in 2001, Lucent announced the Bangalore and Hyderabad Bell Labs locations of India to close. The Gurgaon, India location was not in the August 2001 announcement and stated there were about 500 employees at the location supporting networking, marketing, and sales and not associated with the Bell Labs or R&amp;D aspects.
* Hilversum - in 2002, the Hilversum, Netherlands announced a closure of the facility. The closure would result in 300 employees in the Research and Development manufacturing sector. The Hilversum telecommunications operations were originally sold to AT&amp;T from Philips in 1989.
* Bangalore - in 2004, Lucent announced a Bell Research Center in Bangalore, India with development on data and networking management software. The scientists at Bell Labs Research would work on computer algorithms and switch architectures for wireless, optical, or data networking.

=== Domestic manufacturing locations ===
Many of the following manufacturing locations were transferred to other subsidiaries during Lucent&#x27;s existence, closed, or sold years later. These facilities were established by Western Electric before the 1983 Bell System break-up. AT&amp;T operated and managed these locations from 1984 until 1996. After the AT&amp;T spin-off of Lucent, the telecommunications equipment being manufactured at these locations became products of Lucent Technologies.

<text>Lupercalia, also known as Lupercal, was a pastoral festival of Ancient Rome observed annually on February 15 to purify the city, promoting health and fertility. Lupercalia was also known as &quot;dies Februatus&quot;, after the purification instruments called &quot;februa&quot;, the basis for the month named &quot;Februarius&quot;.

==Name==
The festival was originally known as Februa (&quot;Purifications&quot; or &quot;Purgings&quot;) after the &#x27; which was used on the day. It was also known as &#x27; and gave its name variously, as epithet to Juno Februalis, Februlis, or Februata in her role as patron deity of that month; to a supposed purification deity called Februus; and to February (&#x27;), the month during which the festival occurred. Ovid connects &#x27; to an Etruscan word for &quot;purging&quot;.

The name &quot;Lupercalia&quot; was believed in antiquity to evince some connection with the Ancient Greek festival of the Arcadian Lykaia, a wolf festival (, &quot;lýkos&quot;; ), and the worship of &quot;Lycaean Pan&quot;, assumed to be a Greek equivalent to Faunus, as instituted by Evander. Justin describes a cult image of &quot;the Lycaean god, whom the Greeks call Pan and the Romans Lupercus&quot;, as nude, save for a goatskin girdle. 

The statue stood in the Lupercal, the cave where tradition held that Romulus and Remus were suckled by the she-wolf (Lupa). The cave lay at the foot of the Palatine Hill, on which Romulus was thought to have founded Rome. The name of the festival most likely derives from &quot;lupus&quot;, &quot;wolf&quot;, though both the etymology and its significance are obscure. The wolf appellation may have to do with the fact that an animal predator plays a key role in male rites of passage. Despite Justin&#x27;s assertion, no deity named &quot;Lupercus&quot; has been identified.

==Rites==
===Locations===
The rites were confined to the Lupercal cave, the Palatine Hill, and the Forum, all of which were central locations in Rome&#x27;s foundation myth. Near the cave stood a sanctuary of Rumina, goddess of breastfeeding; and the wild fig-tree (&quot;Ficus Ruminalis&quot;) to which Romulus and Remus were brought by the divine intervention of the river-god Tiberinus; some Roman sources name the wild fig tree &quot;caprificus&quot;, literally &quot;goat fig&quot;. Like the cultivated fig, its fruit is pendulous, and the tree exudes a milky sap if cut, which makes it a good candidate for a cult of breastfeeding.

===Priesthoods===

The Lupercalia had its own priesthood, the &quot;Luperci&quot; (&quot;brothers of the wolf&quot;), whose institution and rites were attributed either to the Arcadian culture-hero Evander, or to Romulus and Remus, erstwhile shepherds who had each established a group of followers. The &quot;Luperci&quot; were young men (&quot;iuvenes&quot;), usually between the ages of 20 and 40. They formed two religious &quot;collegia&quot; (associations) based on ancestry; the &quot;Quinctiliani&quot; (named after the &quot;gens&quot; Quinctia) and the &quot;Fabiani&quot; (named after the &quot;gens&quot; Fabia). Each college was headed by a &quot;magister&quot;.

In 44 BC, a third college, the &quot;Juliani&quot;, was instituted in honor of Julius Caesar; its first &quot;magister&quot; was Mark Antony. The college of &quot;Juliani&quot; disbanded or lapsed following the Assassination of Julius Caesar, and was not re-established in the reforms of his successor, Augustus. In the Imperial era, membership of the two traditional &quot;collegia&quot; was opened to &quot;iuvenes&quot; of equestrian status.

===Sacrifice and fertility rites===
At the Lupercal altar, a male goat (or goats) and a dog were sacrificed by one or another of the &quot;Luperci&quot;, under the supervision of the Flamen dialis, Jupiter&#x27;s chief priest. An offering was also made of salted mealcakes, prepared by the Vestal Virgins. After the blood sacrifice, two &quot;Luperci&quot; approached the altar. Their foreheads were anointed with blood from the sacrificial knife, then wiped clean with wool soaked in milk, after which they were expected to laugh.

The sacrificial feast followed, after which the Luperci cut thongs (known as &quot;&quot;) from the flayed skin of the animal, and ran with these, naked or near-naked, along the old Palatine boundary, in an anticlockwise direction around the hill. In Plutarch&#x27;s description of the Lupercalia, written during the early Roman Empire,

The &quot;Luperci&quot; completed their circuit of the Palatine, then returned to the &quot;Lupercal&quot; cave.

While sometimes repeated uncritically by modern sources, there is no ancient evidence for any kind of lottery or sortition scheme pairing couples for sex. The first descriptions of this fictitious lottery appeared in the 15th century in relation to Valentine&#x27;s Day, with a connection to the Lupercalia first asserted in 18th century antiquarian works, such as those by Alban Butler and Francis Douce.

==History==
The Februa was of ancient and possibly Sabine origin. After February was added to the Roman calendar, Februa occurred on its fifteenth day (&quot;&quot;). Of its various rituals, the most important came to be those of the Lupercalia. The Romans themselves attributed the instigation of the Lupercalia to Evander, a culture hero from Arcadia who was credited with bringing the Olympic pantheon, Greek laws and alphabet to Italy, where he founded the city of Pallantium on the future site of Rome, 60 years before the Trojan War.

Lupercalia was celebrated in parts of Italy; &quot;Luperci&quot; are attested by inscriptions at Velitrae, Praeneste, Nemausus (modern Nîmes) and elsewhere. The ancient cult of the Hirpi Sorani (&quot;wolves of Soranus&quot;, from Sabine &quot;hirpus&quot; &quot;wolf&quot;), who practiced at Mt. Soracte, north of Rome, had elements in common with the Roman Lupercalia.

Descriptions of the Lupercalia festival of 44 BC attest to its continuity. During the festival, Julius Caesar publicly refused a golden crown offered to him by Mark Antony. The Lupercal cave was restored or rebuilt by Augustus, and has been speculated to be identical with a discovered in 2007, below the remains of Augustus&#x27; residence; according to scholarly consensus, the grotto is a nymphaeum, not the Lupercal. The Lupercalia festival is marked on a calendar of 354 alongside traditional and Christian festivals. 

Despite the banning in 391 of all non-Christian cults and festivals, the Lupercalia was celebrated by the nominally Christian populace on a regular basis into the reign of the emperor Anastasius. Pope Gelasius I (494–96) claimed that only the &quot;vile rabble&quot; were involved in the festival and sought its forceful abolition; the Roman Senate protested that the Lupercalia was essential to Rome&#x27;s safety and well-being. This prompted Gelasius&#x27; scornful suggestion that &quot;If you assert that this rite has salutary force, celebrate it yourselves in the ancestral fashion; run nude yourselves that you may properly carry out the mockery&quot;.

There is no contemporary evidence to support the popular notions that Gelasius abolished the Lupercalia, or that he, or any other prelate, replaced it with the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. A literary association between the Lupercalia and the romantic elements of Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day dates back to Chaucer and poetic traditions of courtly love.

==Legacy==
Horace&#x27;s Ode III, 18 alludes to the Lupercalia. The festival or its associated rituals gave its name to the Roman month of February (&quot;&quot;) and thence to the modern month. The Roman god Februus personified both the month and purification, but seems to postdate both.

William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; begins during the Lupercalia. Mark Antony is instructed by Caesar to strike his wife Calpurnia, in the hope that she will be able to conceive.

Research published in 2019 suggests that the word Leprechaun derives from &quot;Lupercus&quot;.
