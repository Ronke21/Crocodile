<text>Mötley Crüe is an American heavy metal band formed in Hollywood, California, in 1981 by bassist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee, with guitarist Mick Mars and lead vocalist Vince Neil joining right after. The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have also achieved seven platinum or multi-platinum certifications, nine Top 10 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart (including 1989&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, which is Mötley Crüe&#x27;s only studio album to reach number one), twenty-two Top 40 mainstream rock hits, and six Top 20 pop singles.

The members of Mötley Crüe are often noted for their hedonistic lifestyles and the androgynous personae they maintained. Following the hard rock and heavy metal origins on the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot; (1981) and &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; (1983), the release of its third album &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot; (1985) saw Mötley Crüe joining the first wave of glam metal. The band is also known for their elaborate live performances, which feature flame thrower guitars, roller coaster drum kits, and heavy use of pyrotechnics such as fireworks and lighting Sixx on fire. Mötley Crüe&#x27;s most recent studio album, &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot;, was released on June 24, 2008. What was planned to be the band&#x27;s final show took place on New Year&#x27;s Eve, December 31, 2015. The concert was filmed for a theatrical and Blu-ray release in 2016.

After two-and-a-half years of inactivity, Neil announced in September 2018 that Mötley Crüe had reunited and was working on new material. On March 22, 2019, the band released four new songs on the soundtrack for its Netflix biopic &quot;The Dirt&quot;, based on the band&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling autobiography of the same name. The soundtrack went to number one on the iTunes All Genres Album Chart, number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Album and Digital Album sales charts, number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and Top 10 worldwide. The autobiography returned to the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list at number 6 on Nonfiction Print and number 8 on Nonfiction Combined Print &amp; E-Book. Mötley Crüe embarked on its first major tour in seven years in the summer and fall of 2022, co-headlining a North American tour with Def Leppard.

The band has experienced several lineup changes over the years, leaving Sixx as the only constant member; these included the introduction of lead vocalist John Corabi (who was Neil&#x27;s replacement from 1992 to 1996) and drummers Randy Castillo and Samantha Maloney, both of whom filled in for Lee following his departure from Mötley Crüe in 1999; he returned to the band in 2004. In October 2022, after 41 years of service, Mars announced his retirement from touring with the band, with John 5 (formerly of David Lee Roth, Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie) replacing him.

==History==
===1981–1983: Early history and &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot;===

The nucleus of the group first came together in early 1981, when former Suite 19 guitarist/lead vocalist, and one-time member of Quiet Riot and Dokken, Greg Leon and drummer Tommy Lee decided to form a new band. They attended the farewell gig of a popular local band called London, and Lee was already impressed by the image and stage presence of their bassist, Nikki Sixx. Even before meeting Sixx, Lee claims he had posters of London on his bedroom walls. &quot;Tommy just loved how Nikki looked&quot;, recalled Leon. &quot;He was gung-ho about him, saying, &#x27;This is the guy we should get&#x27;.&quot; Sixx auditioned twice but Leon felt he was &quot;awful&quot;, telling Lee &quot;He looks great. He&#x27;s great on stage. But he can&#x27;t play bass at all.&quot;
Lee subsequently became friends with Sixx and went to his Hollywood home to listen to new material he was working on. The music had been rejected by his London bandmates for being too heavy, and Lee says he immediately began banging on the table in time with the music and &quot;everything just seemed to mesh&quot;. Lee subsequently hired Sixx for the new band, prompting guitarist/vocalist Leon to quit in protest. &quot;I never played a show with Nikki Sixx. Tommy and I played together many times, but I was gone as soon as Nikki entered the picture. But they couldn&#x27;t find a guitar player or singer initially, so they kept calling me. But I refused,&quot; Leon has said of his time in the band. Sixx and Lee began a search for new members and soon met guitarists Robin Moore (Jeff Gill) and Bob Deal, better known as Mick Mars, after answering an advertisement that he placed in &quot;The Recycler&quot; that read: &quot;Loud, rude and aggressive guitar player available&quot;. Mars auditioned for Sixx, Moore and Lee, and was subsequently hired while Moore was fired at the same session according to the band&#x27;s biography &quot;The Dirt&quot;.

Although a lead vocalist named O&#x27;Dean Peterson was auditioned, Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at Charter Oak High School in Covina, California, and the two had performed in different bands on the garage band circuit. Upon seeing him perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in Hollywood, California, Lee suggested they have Neil join the band. At first Neil refused the offer.

On the same day as Mars, lead vocalist Michael White, who previously played with Nikki Sixx in London, joined the band. But White eventually ended up leaving also.

As the other members of Rock Candy started to think about moving in more of a New Wave direction and became involved in outside projects, Vince Neil grew anxious to try something else. Lee asked again; Neil was hired on April 1, 1981, and the band played its first gig at the Starwood nightclub on April 24.
The newly formed band did not yet have a name. Neil has said that he told his bandmates that he was &quot;thinking about calling the band Christmas&quot;. The other members were not very receptive to that idea. Then, while trying to find a suitable name, Mars remembered an incident that occurred when he was playing with a band called White Horse, when one of the other band members called the group &quot;a motley looking crew&quot;. He had remembered the phrase and later copied it down as &#x27;Mottley Cru&#x27;. After slight modification of the spelling, &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot; was eventually selected as the band&#x27;s name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of metal umlauts, supposedly inspired by the German beer Löwenbräu, which the members were drinking at the time. Other than the periods of February 1992 to September 1996 and of March 1999 to September 2004, and until October 2022, the lineup of Neil, Sixx, Lee, and Mars remained the same.

The band soon met its first manager, Allan Coffman, the thirty-eight-year-old brother-in-law of a friend of Mars&#x27;s driver. The band&#x27;s first release was the single &quot;Stick to Your Guns/Toast of the Town&quot;, which was released on its own record label, Leathür Records, which had a pressing and distribution deal with Greenworld Distribution in Torrance, California. On November 10, 1981, its debut album &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot; was self-produced and released on Leathür, selling 20,000 copies. Coffman&#x27;s assistant Eric Greif set up a tour of Canada, while Coffman and Greif used Mötley Crüe&#x27;s success in the Los Angeles club scene to negotiate with several record labels, eventually signing a recording contract with Elektra Records in early 1982. The debut album was then remixed by producer Roy Thomas Baker and re-released on August 20, 1982—two months after its Canadian Warner Music Group release using the original Leathür mixes—to coincide with the tour.
During the &quot;Crüesing Through Canada Tour &#x27;82&quot;, there were several widely publicized incidents. First, the band was arrested and then released at Edmonton International Airport for wearing their spiked stage wardrobe (considered &quot;dangerous weapons&quot;) through customs, and for Neil arriving with a small carry-on filled with porn magazines (considered &quot;indecent material&quot;); both were staged PR stunts. Customs eventually had the confiscated items destroyed. Second, while playing Scandals Disco in Edmonton, a spurious &quot;bomb threat&quot; against the band made the front page of the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; on June 9, 1982; Lee and assistant band manager Greif were interviewed by police as a result. This too ended up being a staged PR stunt perpetrated by Greif. Lastly, Lee threw a television set from an upper story window of the Sheraton Caravan Hotel. Canadian rock magazine &quot;Music Express&quot; noted that the band was &quot;banned for life&quot; from the city. Despite the tour ending prematurely in financial disaster, it was the basis for the band&#x27;s first international press.

In 1983, the band changed management from Coffman to Doug Thaler and Doc McGhee. McGhee is best known for managing Bon Jovi and later Kiss, starting with their reunion tour in 1996. Greif subsequently sued all parties in a Los Angeles Superior Court action that dragged on for several years, and coincidentally later resurfaced as manager of Sixx&#x27;s former band, London. Coffman himself was sued by several investors to whom he had sold &quot;stock in the band&quot;, including Michigan-based Bill Larson. Coffman eventually declared bankruptcy, as he had mortgaged his home at least three times to cover band expenses.

===1983–1991: International fame and addiction struggles===

The band became rapidly successful in the United States after playing at the US Festival on May 29, 1983, and also with the aid of the new medium of MTV. Their second album, &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;, was released on September 26, 1983. The album represented the band&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough and would eventually be certified 4× platinum. The album generated controversy for its title track and album imagery, both of which invoked Satanism. They then gained the attention of then-former Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne and found themselves opening for Osbourne on his 1984 tour for &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;. The band members were well known for their backstage antics, outrageous clothing, extreme high-heeled boots, heavily applied make-up, and seemingly endless abuse of alcohol and drugs.

The band members also had their share of run-ins with the law. On December 8, 1984, Neil was driving home from a liquor run in his De Tomaso Pantera, which ended in a head-on collision; his passenger, then-Hanoi Rocks drummer Nicholas &quot;Razzle&quot; Dingley, was killed. Neil, charged with a DUI and vehicular manslaughter, was sentenced to 30 days in jail (although he served only 18 days) and subsequently was sued for $2,500,000. The short jail term was negotiated by his lawyers, enabling Neil to tour and pay the civil suit.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot;, was released on June 21, 1985, and dedicated in Dingley&#x27;s honor, and it started a new glam metal phase in the band&#x27;s style. &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot; was commercially successful, reaching number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts and eventually being certified quadruple platinum. However, the recording of the album was fraught with tension in the wake of Neil&#x27;s accident and Sixx&#x27;s growing addiction, and members of the band have said that they consider it a creative disappointment.

Mötley Crüe spent most of the next year on a world tour in support of &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot;. In February 1986, while in London, England, Sixx suffered a near-fatal heroin overdose, and the person who sold him the drugs dumped his unconscious body in a dumpster. The incident inspired Sixx to write the song &quot;Dancing on Glass&quot; for their next album.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;, was released on May 15, 1987, and debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200. Sixx has said in interviews that he believes the album would have debuted at number 1, if not for behind the scenes maneuvering by Whitney Houston&#x27;s record label. The band again changed their look for the album and subsequent tour, trading the glam elements of the previous album for a biker aesthetic. The band faced many of the same personal issues that plagued the recording of &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot; and Sixx has complained that those issues compromised the album&#x27;s quality, although he has spoken more positively about the record in subsequent years.

On December 23, 1987, Sixx suffered a heroin overdose. He was declared clinically dead on the way to the hospital, but the paramedic, who was a Mötley Crüe fan, revived Sixx with two shots of adrenaline. His two minutes in death were the inspiration for the song &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;, which peaked at No. 16 on the Mainstream U.S. chart, and which was featured on 1989&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, their first U.S. number one album. From 1986 to 1987, Sixx kept a daily diary of his heroin addiction and eventually entered rehab in January 1988, prompting the band to cancel their planned tour dates for that year.

While 1988 was the first year that Mötley Crüe did not tour, controversy again hit the band that year in the form of a lawsuit by Matthew Trippe. Trippe claimed that Sixx was hospitalized in 1983 after a car crash involving drugs and that he had been hired as Sixx&#x27;s doppelgänger. The suit was regarding the loss of royalties from his time in Mötley Crüe and the case was not closed until 1993 when Trippe dropped his charges and disappeared from public view.

Their decadent lifestyles almost shattered the band until managers Thaler and McGhee pulled an intervention and refused to allow the band to tour in Europe, fearing that &quot;some [of them] would come back in bodybags&quot;. Shortly after, all the band members jointly entered drug rehabilitation in an effort to move forward as a band.

After finding sobriety, Mötley Crüe reached its peak popularity with the release of their fifth album, the Bob Rock-produced &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, on September 1, 1989. Rock and the band recorded the album in Vancouver, with the band members recording their parts separately for the first time to reduce infighting and to focus on individual performance. Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, who was recording the album &quot;Pump&quot; at the same studio, provided backing vocals. On October 14 of that year, it became a No. 1 album and stayed on the charts for 114 weeks after its release. The band members each stated in interviews that, due in no small part to their collective push for sobriety, &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; was their most solid album musically to that point. The title track and &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; were both nominated for Grammys in the Best Hard Rock Category in 1990 and 1991, respectively, but lost both years to songs by Living Colour. The band did find some success at the American Music Awards, as &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; was nominated twice for Favorite Hard Rock/Metal Award, losing once to Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, but winning the following year, beating out Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Pump&quot; and Poison&#x27;s &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;. Mötley Crüe was also nominated twice for Favorite Hard Rock/Metal Artist.

In 1989, McGhee was fired after the band alleged he had broken several promises that he made in relation to the Moscow Music Peace Festival, including giving his other band, Bon Jovi, advantages in terms of slot placement. Thaler then assumed the role of sole band manager.

Mötley Crüe spent the fall of 1989 and most of 1990 on a massive world tour, the band&#x27;s biggest to that point. It was a major financial success but left the band feeling burnt out. In April 1990, Lee suffered a concussion during a mishap involving a rappelling drum kit stunt during a live concert in New Haven, Connecticut.

On October 1, 1991, the band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Decade of Decadence 81–91&quot;, was released. It peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. It was reportedly designed as &quot;just something for the fans&quot; while the band worked on the next &quot;all new&quot; album.

===1992–2003: Years of turmoil===

Neil left the band in February 1992 following the release of &quot;Decade of Decadence&quot;, during a period in which most other prominent glam metal bands of the 1980s were breaking up or otherwise seeing their popularity decline significantly amid the advent of grunge and alternative music. It remains unclear whether Neil was fired or quit the band. Sixx has long maintained that Neil quit, while Neil insists that he was fired. &quot;Any band has its little spats,&quot; Neil observed in 2000, &quot;and this one basically just stemmed from a bunch of &#x27;fuck yous&#x27; in a rehearsal studio. It went from &#x27;I quit&#x27; to &#x27;You&#x27;re fired&#x27; ... It was handled idiotically. The management just let one of the biggest bands in the world break up.&quot;

In the running for the vacant frontman position was Kik Tracee vocalist Stephen Shareaux. Ultimately Neil was replaced by John Corabi (formerly of Angora and the Scream). Although Mötley&#x27;s self-titled March 1994 release made the &quot;Billboard&quot; top ten (#7), the album was a commercial failure. It also prompted negative reactions from many fans due to Neil&#x27;s absence and its sound. Corabi suggested the band bring back Neil, believing the latter would always be seen as the voice of the band. This eventually resulted in his own firing in 1996. Corabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with Mötley Crüe. Corabi said: &quot;my record was the first record that they had done that didn&#x27;t go platinum, didn&#x27;t make some sort of crazy noise, and everybody panicked&quot;. During his time away from the band, Neil released a moderately successful solo album, &quot;Exposed&quot; in 1993, and a less commercially successful follow-up, &quot;Carved in Stone&quot; in 1995.

After &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine broke out the news in their November 26, 1996 issue, the band reunited with Neil in 1997, after their current manager, Allen Kovac, and Neil&#x27;s manager, Bert Stein, set up a meeting between Neil, Lee, and Sixx. Agreeing to &quot;leave their egos at the door&quot;, the band released &quot;Generation Swine&quot;. Although it debuted at No. 4, and in spite of a live performance at the American Music Awards, the album was a commercial failure, due in part to lack of support from their label.

In 1998, Mötley Crüe&#x27;s contractual ties with Elektra had expired, putting the band in total control of their future, including the ownership of the master recordings of all of their albums. Announcing the end of their relationship with Elektra, the band became one of the few groups to own and control their publishing and music catalog. They are one of only a handful of artists to own the masters to their material and reportedly did so by being the biggest pain they could be until Elektra got fed up and handed over the rights in order to get the band off their label. After leaving Elektra the band created their own label, Mötley Records.

Mötley Crüe released their compilation &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in late 1998, featuring two new songs, &quot;Bitter Pill&quot; and &quot;Enslaved&quot;. In 1999, the band rereleased all their albums, dubbed as &quot;Crücial Crüe&quot;. These limited-edition digital remasters included demos, plus live, instrumental, and previously unreleased tracks. In 1999 the band also released &quot;Supersonic and Demonic Relics&quot;, an updated version of &quot;Decade of Decadence&quot; featuring the original songs from that album and several previously unreleased B-sides and remixes, as well as their first official live album &quot;&quot; (which was the original working title for the studio album &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot;). The band then went on a co-headlining tour with the Scorpions.

In 1999, Lee quit to pursue a solo career, due to increasing tensions with Neil. &quot;All we got was a call from his attorney saying he wasn&#x27;t coming back,&quot; recalled the singer. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t into rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll anymore. He even said that rock is dead ... It all happened during a void in Mötley. We weren&#x27;t even rehearsing, so it was no big deal.&quot;

Lee was replaced by a longtime friend of the band, former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo. The band released &quot;New Tattoo&quot; in July 2000. Before the ensuing tour commenced, Castillo became ill with a duodenal ulcer. The band brought in former Hole drummer Samantha Maloney for the Maximum Rock tour with Megadeth as Castillo concentrated on his health. However, while Castillo was recovering from stomach surgery, he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma after finding a tumor on his jaw. He died on March 26, 2002. Soon afterward, the band went on hiatus.

While the band was on hiatus, Sixx played in side projects 58 and Brides of Destruction. Neil was featured on the first season of VH1&#x27;s reality show &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;, and had his own special titled &quot;Remaking Vince Neil&quot;, which focused on his solo career and attempts to get in better physical shape. Mars, who suffers from a hereditary form of arthritis which causes extensive spinal pain called ankylosing spondylitis, went into seclusion in 2001 dealing with health issues. Lee went on to form Methods of Mayhem and also performed as a solo artist during this time.

A 2001 autobiography titled &quot;The Dirt&quot;, co-authored by all four of the band members and Neil Strauss, presented Mötley Crüe as &quot;the world&#x27;s most notorious rock band&quot;. The book made the top ten on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and spent ten weeks there, and would return to the list after the film adaptation was released in spring 2019.

In 2003, the band released two box sets entitled &quot;Music to Crash Your Car To: Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Vol. 2&quot;, featuring the music from their entire career. The titles of the collections were heavily criticized by Hanoi Rocks singer Michael Monroe, among others, due to their possible reference to Neil and Razzle&#x27;s fatal automobile accident, and that Neil was found guilty of manslaughter for the incident.

===2004–2007: Reunion and renewed success===
A promoter in England, Mags Revell, began clamoring for a Mötley Crüe reunion, ostensibly presenting himself as the voice of anxious fans waiting for more from the band. After meeting with management several times, in September 2004, Sixx announced that he and Neil had returned to the studio and had begun recording new material. In December 2004, the four original members announced a reunion tour, staging an announcement event in which they arrived at the Hollywood Palladium in a hearse. The tour began on February 14, 2005, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The resulting compilation album, &quot;Red, White &amp; Crüe&quot;, was released in February 2005. It features the band members&#x27; favorite original songs plus three new tracks, &quot;If I Die Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Sick Love Song&quot; (co-written by Sixx and James Michael), and a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;. A small controversy was caused when it was suggested that neither Lee nor Mars played on the new tracks (duties were supposedly handled by Vandals drummer Josh Freese). However, a VH1 documentary of the band&#x27;s reunion later showed that Lee did indeed play on some of the tracks. The Japanese release of &quot;Red, White &amp; Crüe&quot; includes an extra new track titled &quot;I&#x27;m a Liar (and That&#x27;s the Truth)&quot;. &quot;Red, White &amp; Crüe&quot; charted at No. 6 and has since gone platinum.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2004 the band appeared on a live episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Neil yelled an obscenity during the performance, leading to an FCC investigation. The NBC network responded by banning the band, leading to the band subsequently suing the network, claiming they were being unfairly punished. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court and the band made several subsequent appearances on the network.

In 2005, Mötley Crüe was involved in an animation-comedy spoof &quot;Disaster!&quot;, which was written by Paul Benson and Matt Sullivan and which was used as the introduction film to concerts on their Carnival of Sins tour. That tour continued throughout 2005 and was commemorated with the release of a live album and DVD in 2006. In the fall of 2005 the band re-recorded &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; as a duet with Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington and donated the proceeds to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

In 2006, Mötley Crüe went on the Route of All Evil Tour, co-headlining with Aerosmith and taking performers from Lucent Dossier Experience on the road with them. 2006 also saw the band sign with Paramount Pictures and MTV Films to adapt their autobiography &quot;The Dirt&quot; into a movie, but the production was delayed for several years and the deal eventually fell through. In June 2007, Mötley Crüe set out on a small European tour. A lawsuit was filed by Neil, Mars and Sixx against Carl Stubner, Lee&#x27;s manager. The three sued him for contracting for Lee to appear on two unsuccessful reality shows the band claim hurt its image. It was later reported on Motley.com that the lawsuit had been settled.

In 2007, Sixx published his diaries as the bestselling autobiography &quot;The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star&quot;, covering the band&#x27;s &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; world tour and his 1987 overdose, and Sixx&#x27;s side project band released &quot;The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack&quot; as a musical parallel to the novel.

===2008–2010: &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot;===

The band hosted the Motley Cruise from January 24 to 28 in 2008; this featured Ratt, Skid Row and Slaughter.

On June 11, 2008, Mötley Crüe and manager Burt Stein filed suit against each other. Stein was Neil&#x27;s personal manager and also, according to the band and rival manager Kovac, served as the band&#x27;s manager at one time. The band and Kovac sued in Los Angeles County Superior Court, claiming Stein was not entitled to a cut of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s earnings. Stein sued the same day in Nashville&#x27;s federal court, saying he was entitled to 1.875 percent of what the band makes. Other litigation between the parties also ensued in Nevada. In July 2009, lawyers for both sides announced that the disputes had been &quot;amicably resolved&quot; through a &quot;global settlement&quot;.

Mötley Crüe&#x27;s ninth studio album, titled &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot;, was released in Japan on June 17, 2008, and in America on June 24, 2008. The album was originally titled &quot;The Dirt&quot;, as it was loosely based on the band&#x27;s autobiography of the same name, but the title was later changed. In the US, the album was released by Eleven Seven Music. Eleven Seven also took over US distribution of their back catalog.

iTunes picked &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot; in their &quot;Best of 2008&quot; in the Rock category as the number one song. The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award in the &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance&quot; category, but lost to &quot;Wax Simulacra&quot; by The Mars Volta. The song was released in the music game series &quot;Rock Band&quot; as downloadable content the day the single was released. It was briefly sold as a &quot;Rock Band&quot; exclusive, making Mötley Crüe the first band to release a single exclusively through a video game. The song sold more units via &quot;Rock Band&quot; than it did via traditional streaming sites. Additionally, the entire &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; album was released as downloadable content in &quot;Rock Band&quot;, excluding &quot;T.n.T. (Terror &#x27;n Tinseltown)&quot;.

From July 1 to August 31, 2008, Mötley Crüe headlined the popular Crüe Fest music festival, which included opening acts Buckcherry, Papa Roach, Trapt, and They then spent the fall and winter of that year on tour with Hinder, Theory of a Deadman and The Last Vegas.
The band made a guest appearance in the fourth season finale of the FOX crime dramedy &quot;Bones&quot; on May 14, 2009, entitled &quot;The End in the Beginning&quot;, performing the song &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;. The following month they performed at the Download Festival at the Donington Park motorsports circuit (June 12–14, 2009), playing on the second stage on Friday night.

Mötley Crüe headlined the &quot;Crüe Fest 2&quot; festival, which ran from July to September 2009. Supporting them were Godsmack, Theory of a Deadman, Drowning Pool, and Charm City Devils. The band&#x27;s set celebrated the 20th anniversary of &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; by performing the album in its entirety on each night of the tour. They also re-released the album as a special 20th anniversary deluxe edition.

Mötley Crüe headlined Ozzfest in 2010, along with Ozzy Osbourne and Rob Halford. Neil also released his third solo album and autobiography, both entitled &quot;Tattoos and Tequila&quot;.

===2011–2015: The Final Tour and retirement from touring===

Mötley Crüe co-headlined a mid-year tour with Poison and special guests New York Dolls in 2011 for the band&#x27;s 30th Anniversary and Poison&#x27;s 25th anniversary. On August 30, 2011, Mötley Crüe, along with co-headliners Def Leppard and special guests Steel Panther, announced a UK Tour commencing in December 2011.

In February 2012 the band appeared along with supermodel Adriana Lima in a commercial for the Kia Optima, which premiered during Super Bowl XLVI. February 2012 also saw the band host its first residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. In March 2012, Mötley Crüe announced a co-headlining tour with Kiss. The tour kicked off July 20 in Bristow, Virginia, and ran through September 23. In the spring and summer of 2013 the band toured throughout Canada with Big Wreck. The band returned to Las Vegas for a second residency in the fall of 2013.

On January 28, 2014, at the conference inside Beacher&#x27;s Madhouse Theater in Hollywood, Mötley Crüe announced the full details of its retirement, including a tour initially spanning 70 North American dates, with Alice Cooper playing as a special guest. The tour commenced in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July 2, 2014. The band members had signed a &quot;cessation of touring agreement&quot;, which prevented them from touring under the Mötley Crüe name beyond the end of 2015. In a later interview, Sixx talked about the possibility of releasing new music, saying that &quot;We have music written, [but] it&#x27;s not put together yet&quot;. He also speculated that the band would release it in a song-by-song format as opposed to a full-length album format, elaborating with &quot;It&#x27;s hard, to be honest with you, to spend six [or] nine months to write eleven songs—all those lyrics ... everything ... the vocals, the guitars, the bass, the sonics, the mixing, the mastering, the artwork. ... You put it out and nothing [happens], because now people cherry-pick songs. So we go, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we write songs and find vehicles to get one, two or four songs to ten million people rather than eleven songs to a hundred thousand people.&quot;

During the tour the band played a new song, &quot;All Bad Things&quot;, over the speakers throughout the venue before it took the stage. On November 22, 2014, in Spokane, Washington, at the Spokane Arena, Mötley Crüe played the final concert of the first North American leg of The Final Tour.

On January 15, 2015, it was announced that the band&#x27;s career would end with international concerts in Japan, Australia, Brazil and Europe before heading out for a second leg of North American concerts throughout 2015, ending with a concert at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on December 27, followed by three concerts at Staples Center on December 28, 30 and 31, 2015. In May 2015, The Crüe and Alice Cooper announced a set of 12 concert dates for Europe at a conference in London.

On September 19, 2015, the band played the Rock in Rio festival on the main stage.

Mötley Crüe performed, for what was then advertised to be the last time, at Staples Center in Los Angeles on December 31, 2015. The band reported that its New Year&#x27;s Eve show was going to be released as a film in 2016; the movie was titled &quot;Motley Crue: THE END&quot;.

===2018–2022: Reunion, &quot;The Dirt&quot; film and return to touring===

In 2017, frontman Vince Neil told host Sammy Hagar on the show &quot;Rock and Roll Road Trip&quot; that Mötley Crüe were &quot;completely done&quot;. However, on September 13, 2018, Neil announced via Twitter that Mötley Crüe was recording four new songs; this was later also confirmed by bassist Nikki Sixx, who said that the new material was recorded for the film adaptation of the band&#x27;s biography, &quot;The Dirt&quot;. Neil also clarified that, though the band has signed a contract to no longer tour, they still plan to continue putting out new music for the future.

Netflix released &quot;The Dirt&quot; biopic based on the book of the same name that coincided with an 18-song soundtrack on March 22, 2019. The film is directed by Jeff Tremaine (&quot;Jackass&quot;), produced by Julie Yorn and Erik Olsen, executive produced by Rick Yorn, and co-produced by Kovac, who is Mötley Crüe&#x27;s manager, CEO of Eleven Seven Label Group and founder of Tenth Street Entertainment. &quot;The Dirt&quot; stars Daniel Webber as Neil, Iwan Rheon (&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;) as Mars, Douglas Booth as Sixx and Colson Baker (a.k.a. Machine Gun Kelly) as Lee. Also starring in the movie is Pete Davidson (&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;) as record executive Tom Zutaut. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;The Dirt&quot; is &quot;a truly debauched movie that delves deep into their rise from the early Eighties Sunset Strip metal scene to their days as arena headliners.&quot; The film portrays many of the adventures the band went on including touring with Ozzy Osbourne and the &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot; tour.

The first new song from the soundtrack was &quot;The Dirt (Est.1981)&quot;, which was released on February 22, 2019. The band wrote two other new songs, &quot;Ride With the Devil&quot; and &quot;Crash and Burn&quot;, and covered Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, on the album. The soundtrack additionally included fourteen previously released Mötley Crüe songs. It was produced by Bob Rock, who produced &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, and was released on March 22, 2019, on Mötley Records and Eleven Seven Music. The soundtrack hit the Billboard Top 10 at No. 10, the first time Mötley Crüe hit the Billboard Top 10 in over a decade.

The group&#x27;s legacy was also featured on a 2019 episode of the Reelz documentary series &quot;Breaking the Band&quot;. Both Neil and Sixx had a negative reaction to how things were portrayed in the episode. Sixx said they would be pursuing legal action and called Reelz &quot;the bottom of the barrel&quot;.

In November 2019, rumors started to circulate of the band reuniting for a 2020 tour with Def Leppard and Poison, following the success of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; reunion tour. The band responded to an online petition rallying for the group&#x27;s return, saying &quot;this is interesting...&quot;. On November 18, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine reported that all four band members had agreed to come back together for the tour, utilizing a loophole in their &quot;Cessation of Touring&quot; contract. Later that same day, the band confirmed all reports with a statement on their website, posting a press release and a video of the contract being destroyed. On December 4, 2019, it was officially confirmed that Mötley Crüe would embark on The Stadium Tour with Def Leppard, Poison and Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts in the summer of 2020. Also in December 2019 Mick Mars announced that his debut solo album would be released in the spring of 2020. On June 1, 2020, Mötley Crüe announced that The Stadium Tour would be rescheduled to June–September 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was postponed once again to 2022, due to similar circumstances amid the pandemic. In January 2022, in the wake of the Omicron variant surge, Sixx was asked by a fan on Twitter if The Stadium Tour was still happening this year; his response was, &quot;We&#x27;re 1000% hitting the road with Def Leppard for The Stadium Tour in mid-June...I can&#x27;t f&#x27;ckin wait...&quot; Mötley Crüe later joined Def Leppard again for another tour together in Europe in 2023.

In November 2021, Mötley Crüe sold their entire back catalogue to BMG Rights Management.

In September 2022, Neil announced in an interview with the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; that the band would return for a US tour in 2023. In that same interview, he also ruled out the possibility of further studio albums, stating that they were &quot;strictly a touring band&quot;.

===2022–present: Retirement of Mick Mars and &quot;Cancelled&quot;===

On October 26, 2022, Mick Mars retired as a touring member of the band due to ongoing health issues, according to a statement released by Mars&#x27; publicist. The next day, the band confirmed that John 5 would take Mars&#x27; place as their new touring guitarist, although he was later confirmed as a permanent member of the band in April 2023. In a December interview with A Radio Rock in Brazil, Sixx confirmed that the band was not going away anytime soon, and stated that the band would be touring for eight more years.

On April 6, 2023, Mars sued the band, alleging that they were trying to remove him. In response to the lawsuit, the band issued a statement on the same day, denying that they had fired Mars, and that while he was still a member, had quit touring.

On April 19, 2023, the band announced that they were working on new music with record producer Bob Rock, ruling out the possibility of the band working with Mars again. Sixx later released a statement on a then-upcoming album on May 15, 2023, stating that it had finished production and the band had begun mixing the album. In June 2023, Neil confirmed that they were set to perform another stadium tour in 2024. In the following month, he confirmed that the band recorded three brand new songs. In September 2023, John 5 confirmed the title of a new song as &quot;Dogs of War&quot;. He also said that the band recorded a cover of &quot;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)&quot; by the Beastie Boys.

On April 23, 2024, it was announced that Mötley Crüe had signed a deal with Big Machine Records, and three days later the band released &quot;Dogs of War&quot;, their first song in five years and their first with John 5. Neil told &quot;Billboard&quot; that same month that additional music from Mötley Crüe could be released by the end of 2024 or in 2025, but also stated that new material could result in &quot;a few songs here, a few songs there&quot; rather than a full-length album. Lee did not rule out releasing a new Mötley Crüe album, but stated that &quot;recording and writing some stuff that you&#x27;re feeling right at the moment and releasing it is, for us, a lot more a lot more fun and sort of a time stamp of where we&#x27;re at right now.&quot; Sixx said that the band had recorded two other new singles that were ready to be released. A new EP, titled &quot;Cancelled&quot;, was released on October 4, 2024.

==Feuds and criticisms==
===Metallica===
Often clashing during the early 1980s, both bands were fighting for dominance in the Los Angeles metal scene during Metallica&#x27;s years prior to their relocation to the Bay Area. Both singer/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich expressed their hatred of the heavy metal scene in Los Angeles during the time and frequently attacked multiple up-and-coming local bands in multiple interviews, including Mötley Crüe. Allegedly before a show in 1982, Ulrich claimed he drunkenly screamed &quot;Fuck Mötley Crüe!&quot; at the band from outside the Troubadour in Hollywood, in which Sixx chased Ulrich in retaliation. Former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine during a 1983 interview had also taken aim at the band by claiming the Crüe and glam metal were an abbreviation for &quot;Gay LA Music&quot;. Though despite their public disdain for glam metal, Metallica were impressed by the production and commercial success of &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; in 1989, later hiring the album&#x27;s producer Bob Rock to produce their self-titled fifth album in 1991. Several years later, both Sixx and Ulrich would reignite the animosity after Ulrich accused Mötley Crüe of performing to a backing track at the 1997 American Music Awards. Sixx responded via an online forum and would also attack Metallica&#x27;s then-recent album &quot;Load&quot; insulting multiple members of the band for their change in sound and visual image. During a 2003 interview, Sixx would strangely defend Metallica&#x27;s then-latest album &quot;St. Anger&quot; by claiming &quot;I have learned to have sympathy for the enemy&quot;. In 2006, both Tommy Lee and former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted took part in a reality show entitled &quot;Rock Star: Supernova&quot; as they would both participate in creating a supergroup while the show&#x27;s premise revolved around finding a frontman via contest. During a 2011 meet-and-greet in Mexico City, Hetfield was approached by a fan attacking Mötley Crüe due to their public image and frequent appearances in tabloids. Hetfield refused to directly respond to the fan&#x27;s comments towards Mötley Crüe but did find humor in his insults toward the band. In 2015, Lee would reignite the feud when he posted a Tweet featuring a picture of Ulrich with the words &quot;Straight Outta Tempo&quot; superimposed over his face. Lee presumably used a meme maker intended to promote the 2015 N.W.A biopic &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. Following the post by Lee, Vince Neil had stated online that he was unaware of the feud with Metallica; however, during a later interview with an Oregon radio show, Neil was again asked about the band&#x27;s current relationship with Metallica and hung up on the show&#x27;s host. Things were alleged to have calmed down by 2017, when Hetfield appeared on Sixx&#x27;s radio show &#x27;Sixx Sense&#x27;. During an interview in 2021, Sixx applauded Metallica&#x27;s longevity and praised several of their releases during an interview.

===Guns N&#x27; Roses===
Though Guns N&#x27; Roses were initially hired to open for Mötley Crüe during the summer of 1987, things grew hostile between both sides in 1988 after Vince Neil alleged that then-Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin had assaulted his then-wife Sharise at the famed Cathouse club, according to Neil and club owner Riki Rachtman. Things came to a breaking point at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards following Mötley Crüe&#x27;s presentation of the award for &#x27;Best Metal Video&#x27; to Guns N&#x27; Roses; however, only bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler appeared at the stage to accept it. Following their performance with Tom Petty, Neil rushed the side of the stage and threw a punch at Stradlin before being restrained by security. Guns N&#x27; Roses frontman Axl Rose was enraged with the incident, threatening Neil after security had separated the two. During an interview in August 1990, Rose later challenged Neil to a fight during an interview with Kurt Loder, claiming &quot;Anytime he wants it, Atlantic City; I Don&#x27;t Care, We&#x27;ll put money on it.&quot; Neil responded in early 1991 by also challenging Rose to a fight: &quot;Axl if you are watching this, I want to challenge you to a fight. I&#x27;m gonna give you time and I&#x27;m gonna give you the place. There&#x27;s no backing out now buddy. It&#x27;s time to put up or shut up.&quot;, later expressing his intent to possibly host the fight in an arena. Reportedly, Eddie Van Halen and then-current Van Halen singer Sammy Hagar had offered money to possibly host the fight at Madison Square Garden in New York City. However, for unknown reasons, neither Rose or Neil responded to the offer. Neil claims Stradlin had called him with an apology for the incident, but the 1991 Guns N&#x27; Roses track &quot;Shotgun Blues&quot; was allegedly a diss track aimed at Neil. Tensions were reported to have died down shortly afterwards when both Tommy Lee and former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke participated with former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted in a reality show entitled &quot;Rockstar: Supernova&quot;, as they would contribute musical parts in the show&#x27;s contest to find a vocalist of the newly formed supergroup. Things remained cordial until 2009 when Neil had lobbed insults towards Rose in response to Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; most recent album, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, calling the record a flop and criticizing Rose for his management of the band at the time. In 2014, &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine honored Rose by calling him &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Singer&quot;; in response, Neil jokingly mocked the award on Twitter, but deleted his response shortly afterward.

===Godsmack===
The feud between alternative metal band Godsmack and Mötley Crüe stems from the two sides clashing after Godsmack was hired as one of several supporting acts for Mötley Crüe during the band&#x27;s 2009 Crüe Fest 2 tour. Godsmack frontman Sully Erna and drummer Shannon Larkin have claimed the feud originated from Mötley Crüe&#x27;s treatment of the support bands on tour, particularly Godsmack&#x27;s fans who allegedly often left venues early following their own performance. Larkin recalls in a 2011 interview with &quot;Loudwire&quot;: &quot;Mötley Crüe&#x27;s security were real weird with our guests getting backstage, like our guests might want to look at Mötley Crüe. Our guests were there to see us and they didn&#x27;t care a shit about Mötley Crüe. Mötley Crüe is a legendary band that we all respect. When I was 17, I had &#x27;Shout at the Devil&#x27; but it just kind of fronted us a little that they would think that our guests would be star-struck over them. So, that&#x27;s where the bad blood came from.&quot; Sully Erna allegedly penned the 2010 track &quot;Cryin&#x27; Like a Bitch&quot; about Sixx in regards to his behavior towards Godsmack during the tour, though Shannon Larkin claims the song was written about former San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers. Sixx continued in a war of insults with the band as he alleged that Godsmack had asked to appear on his radio show multiple times, due to initial allegations of it being written as a diss track aimed at Sixx. During a 2015 appearance on the &quot;Jasta Show&quot; (hosted by Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta), Erna would attack Sixx further by calling Sixx an &quot;old, fat, washed-up has-been&quot;. Erna continued the tirade by even challenging Sixx to a fight, claiming: &quot;I&#x27;ll say it straight out: I&#x27;ve never met a bigger fucking dick in my life than Nikki Sixx. He&#x27;s a douchebag. He&#x27;s straight-up a fucking douche, and I don&#x27;t give a fuck what he says. He knows exactly where I am, and he knows exactly how he can find me anytime that motherfucker has the balls to come and look me up&quot;. Sixx responded to Erna&#x27;s comments on a Facebook livestream, calling him a &quot;baby&quot;. Sixx would also claim the band would refuse any future festival dates if they were booked on the same bill as Godsmack.

===Steel Panther===
The comedic glam metal band Steel Panther engaged in a feud with Mötley Crüe following a tour between the two bands and Def Leppard in 2011. Numerous members of Steel Panther claim they were heavily influenced by Mötley Crüe&#x27;s music; however, touring with the band exhibited a hostile environment, particularly from Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee. In the years following the tour, guitarist Satchel claimed Tommy Lee had been rather hostile towards multiple band members due to allegations that he and singer Michael Starr had sex with Lee&#x27;s girlfriend at the time. Starr also commented on Mötley Crüe&#x27;s other feud with Godsmack, claiming Sully Erna would severely beat Sixx in a fistfight. In a 2015 interview, Starr would claim the members of Mötley Crüe take themselves too seriously given the comedic nature of Steel Panther&#x27;s music. Sixx would respond in 2016 claiming he prioritized taking his musical contributions much more seriously. During a 2018 interview, Satchel claimed &quot;There are bands that hate our guts... We did a tour a few years ago with Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe&quot;. Things escalated in 2019 when drummer Stix Zadinia and Starr appeared in a video on the channel &#x27;Little Punk People&#x27; where the two were asked which dead musicians they could revive; Starr jokingly claimed he wanted to bring back Vince Neil from the 1980s, enraging Sixx, who later attacked Starr on Twitter for his comment. Shortly following the response from Sixx, Steel Panther&#x27;s band account replied with an interview Mötley Crüe gave from 1994 (whilst Neil was not a part of the band), in which Sixx and guitarist Mick Mars mocked and joked at Neil&#x27;s weight following a jet ski accident. Though Mötley Crüe would not respond to the post, multiple band members of Steel Panther have praised Mötley Crüe&#x27;s music as influential in multiple interviews afterwards.

===Former Mötley Crüe members===
==== Mick Mars ====
On October 27, 2022, co-founding guitarist Mick Mars publicly announced his retirement from touring with the band after 41 years due to complications with ankylosing spondylitis, a degenerative form of inflammatory arthritis leaving him unable to perform on tour. Shortly afterwards, the band announced longtime Rob Zombie guitarist John 5 would be his replacement during the ongoing tour. In an interview with &quot;Ultimate Guitar&quot; dated March 13, 2023, Carmine Appice, a friend of Mars&#x27;, claimed that Mars, in addition to his declining health, had lost enjoyment for touring. Enraged with the comments, Nikki Sixx responded on Twitter, attacking Appice, referring to him as &quot;a washed up drummer.&quot; Following Sixx&#x27;s comments, Mars began to attack the band during an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; published April 6, 2023, claiming the band&#x27;s severance payout was &#x27;laughable&#x27; as his royalties had allegedly been cut to 7.5% as a result of his retirement. Mars further claimed he was forced to retire as opposed to being fired by the band based on their own displeasure with his medical ailments.

On April 7, 2023, Mars publicly filed a lawsuit against Mötley Crüe in the Los Angeles County Superior Court for unpaid royalties, claiming the band had severely cut his touring royalty agreement from 25% to 5% as a direct result of his retirement. The band&#x27;s representative Sasha Frid had revealed claims that a 2008 legal agreement signed by all four band members had documented that no resigning participants would receive the same compensation attributable to live performances or merchandise sales if a particular member had chosen to quit the band. Mars&#x27; attorney Ed McPherson publicly attacked the band in a statement due to their failure to reveal updated financial documents in regards to Mars&#x27; payout agreement following his retirement in October. According to Mars&#x27; accounts in the lawsuit, the band had also forced him to sell off his remaining share in the band, labeling their behavior as &#x27;bullying&#x27;. Nikki Sixx would make a public statement on Twitter expressing his disappointment with the lawsuit but offered his public support for Mars nonetheless. Following this statement Mars would further attack the band in a &quot;Variety&quot; article, taking aim at Lee and Neil for their previous legal incidents and alleged the band had been performing with a backing track throughout the tour.

During an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on July 3, 2023, Mars elaborated further by claiming he has refused to speak with any members of the band ever again, stating his intention to pursue his full royalty percentage. , the matter remained in litigation.

==== John Corabi ====
Following the firing of Vince Neil in 1992, Mötley Crüe hired John Corabi as their new lead singer prior to the recording of their 1994 self-titled album. Fan reactions were mixed due to the uncharted nature of the band&#x27;s change in sound with Corabi, in addition to their new stylistic direction of the 1990s. As the band began writing for their upcoming seventh album, &quot;Generation Swine&quot;, tensions over the album&#x27;s creative direction began to surface between the band and Corabi. Corabi blamed much of the poor songwriting and production on Nikki Sixx&#x27;s leadership, while Sixx blamed Corabi for being unable to write songs fluidly. The band had previously hired new manager Allen Kovac in 1994 prior to the release of the self-titled album; however, the mixed response to the record in addition to backlash towards Corabi from longtime fans proved to be strenuous on the band&#x27;s public image, resulting in the band firing Corabi during the recording of &quot;Generation Swine&quot;. The band were forced by management and fan responses to rehire Neil, however; tensions with Corabi remained high for multiple years following the split. Corabi would later sue the band in 1997 due to removal of his songwriting credits on the album. Despite the tensions, Corabi took part in a short-lived supergroup with Sixx entitled Brides of Destruction with L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns in 2003. Corabi later outlined his tensions with Sixx would resurface during the project and would attack Sixx during multiple public interviews for his poor leadership and even insulted his playing abilities. Following guitarist Mick Mars&#x27; lawsuit against the band in 2023, Corabi expressed his support for Mars while criticizing the band&#x27;s poor financial decisions.

==Musical style and legacy==
Mötley Crüe&#x27;s musical style is most commonly described as heavy metal, glam metal, and hard rock. According to AllMusic, the band has &quot;a knack for melding pop hooks to heavy metal theatrics.&quot; The band explored alternative metal and grunge sounds on &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot; (1994) and industrial rock on &quot;Generation Swine&quot; (1997).

Music critic Martin Popoff&#x27;s book &quot;The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot; lists seven of the band&#x27;s songs in its ranking. Mötley Crüe was ranked tenth on MTV&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 10 Heavy Metal Bands of All-Time&quot; and ninth on &quot;VH1&#x27;s All Time Top Ten Metal Bands&quot;. Music website &quot;Loudwire&quot; named the band the 22nd greatest metal band of all time. &quot;Spin&quot; named &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; the 11th best metal album of all time. In 2013 &quot;LA Weekly&quot; named the band the 3rd best &quot;hair metal&quot; band of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Too Fast For Love&quot; the 22nd best metal album of all time.

In 2006, the band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 2014, the tribute album &quot;Nashville Outlaws&quot; was released, featuring country music stars including Rascal Flatts, LeAnn Rimes and Darius Rucker covering various Mötley Crüe songs. The album debuted at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Album chart and number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<text>Mandriva Linux (a fusion of the French distribution Mandrake Linux and the Brazilian distribution Conectiva Linux) is a discontinued Linux distribution developed by Mandriva S.A.

Each release lifetime was 18 months for base updates (Linux, system software, etc.) and 12 months for desktop updates (window managers, desktop environments, web browsers, etc.). Server products received full updates for at least five years after their release.

The last release of Mandriva Linux was in August 2011. Most developers who were laid off went to Mageia. Later on, the remaining developers teamed up with community members and formed OpenMandriva, a continuation of Mandriva.

==History==
The first release of Mandrake was based on Red Hat Linux (version 5.1) and K Desktop Environment 1 in July 1998. After that, it moved away from the Red Hat standard and Red Hat inspiration and influence on its own design and implementation, and became a completely separate distribution. Mandrake included a number of original tools that make system configuration less difficult. It was the brainchild of Gaël Duval, who wanted to focus on ease of use for new users.

This goal was met as Mandrake Linux gained a reputation as &quot;one of the easiest to install and user-friendly Linux distributions&quot;. Mandrake Linux earned praise as a Linux distribution that users could use all the time, without dual booting into Microsoft Windows for compatibility with web sites or software unavailable under Linux. CNET called the user experience of Mandrake Linux 8.0 the most polished available at that time.

Duval became the co-founder of Mandrakesoft, but was laid off from the company in 2006 along with many other employees.

===Name changes===

From its inception until the release of version 8.0, Mandrake named its flagship distribution Linux-Mandrake. From version 8.1 to 9.2 the distribution name was reversed and called Mandrake Linux.

In February 2004, MandrakeSoft lost a court case against Hearst Corporation, owners of King Features Syndicate. Hearst contended that MandrakeSoft infringed upon King Features&#x27; trademarked character Mandrake the Magician. As a precaution, MandrakeSoft renamed its products by removing the space between the brand name and the product name and changing the first letter of the product name to lower case, thus creating one word. Starting from version 10.0, Mandrake Linux became known as mandrakelinux, and its logo changed accordingly. Similarly, MandrakeMove (a Live CD version) became Mandrakemove.

In April 2005, Mandrakesoft announced the corporate acquisition of Conectiva, a Brazilian-based company that produced a Linux distribution for Portuguese-speaking (Brazil) and Spanish-speaking Latin America. As a result of this acquisition and the legal dispute with Hearst Corporation, Mandrakesoft announced that the company was changing its name to Mandriva, and that their Linux distribution &quot;Mandrake Linux&quot; would henceforward be known as Mandriva Linux.

==Features==
===Installation, control and administration===
Mandriva Linux contained the Mandriva Control Center, which eases configuration of some settings. It has many programs known as Drakes or Draks, collectively named drakxtools, to configure many different settings. Examples include MouseDrake to set up a mouse, DiskDrake to set up disk partitions and drakconnect to set up a network connection. They are written using GTK+ and Perl, and most of them can run in both graphical and text mode using the ncurses interface.

===Desktops===
Mandriva Linux 2011 was released only with KDE Plasma Desktop, whereas other desktop environments were available but not officially supported. Older Mandriva versions also used KDE as standard but others such as GNOME were also supported.

===Package manager===

Mandriva Linux used a package manager called urpmi, which functions as a wrapper to the .rpm binaries. It is similar to apt from Debian &amp; Ubuntu, pacman from Arch Linux, yum or dnf from Fedora in that it allows seamless installation of a given software package by automatically installing the other packages needed. It is also media-transparent due to its ability to retrieve packages from various media, including network/Internet, CD/DVD and local disk. Urpmi also has an easy-to-use graphical front-end called rpmdrake, which is integrated into the Mandriva Control Center.

===Live USB===
A Live USB of Mandriva Linux can be created manually or with UNetbootin.

==Versions==
From 2007–2011, Mandriva was released on a 6-month fixed-release cycle, similar to Ubuntu and Fedora.

===Latest version===
The latest stable version is Mandriva Linux 2011 (&quot;Hydrogen&quot;), released on 28 August 2011.

===Development version===
The development tree of Mandriva Linux has always been known as &quot;Cooker&quot;. This tree is directly released as a new stable version.

=== Version history===
This table shows how Mandriva developed over time.

====&quot;Mandrake&quot; releases====


==Editions==
Each release of Mandriva Linux was split into several different editions. Each edition is derived from the same master tree, most of which is available on the public mirrors: all free / open source software, and all non-free software which is under a license that allows unrestricted distribution to the general public, is available from the public mirrors. Only commercial software under a license that does not allow unrestricted distribution to the general public (but for which Mandriva has negotiated an agreement to distribute it with paid copies) is not available from public mirrors.

===Mandriva Linux Free===
Mandriva Linux Free was a &#x27;traditional&#x27; distribution (i.e. one that comes with a dedicated installer, to install the distribution to the computer before it is run). It was &#x27;free&#x27; in both senses: it consists entirely of free and open-source software, and it was made available for public download at no charge. It was usually available in CD (three or four discs) and DVD editions for x86 32- and 64-bit CPU architectures. It was aimed at users to whom software freedom is important, and also at users who prefer a traditional installer to the installable live CD system used by One. The package selection was tailored towards regular desktop use. It consisted of a subset of packages from the &#x27;main&#x27; and &#x27;contrib&#x27; sections of the master tree. Mandriva Linux Free was phased in 2011 in favor of a single edition approach with Mandriva Desktop 2011.

===Mandriva Linux One===

Mandriva Linux One was a free to download hybrid distribution, being both a Live CD and an installer (with an installation wizard that includes disk partitioning tools).

Several Mandriva Linux One versions were provided for each Mandriva Linux release preceding Mandriva 2008. Users could choose between different languages, select either the KDE or GNOME desktops and include or exclude non-free software. The default version included the KDE desktop with non-free software included. The One images consist of a subset of packages from the &#x27;main&#x27;, &#x27;contrib&#x27; and &#x27;non-free&#x27; sections of the master tree, with the documentation files stripped from the packages to save space.

Mandriva Linux One 2008 has a smaller range of versions. There are KDE and GNOME versions with the default set of languages. There are also two KDE versions with alternative sets of languages. All versions include non-free software.

===Mandriva Linux Powerpack===
Mandriva Linux Powerpack was a &#x27;traditional&#x27; distribution (in other words, one that comes with a dedicated installer, DrakX, which is first used to install the distribution to the hard disk of the computer before it is run). It is the main commercial edition of Mandriva Linux, and as such, requires payment for its use. It contains several non-free packages intended to add value for the end user, including non-free drivers like the NVIDIA and ATI graphics card drivers, non-free firmware for wireless chips and modems, some browser plugins such as Java and Flash, and some full applications such as Cedega, Adobe Reader and RealPlayer. It was sold directly from the Mandriva Store website and through authorized resellers. It was also made available via a subscription service, which allowed unlimited downloads of Powerpack editions for the last few Mandriva releases for a set yearly fee. It consisted of a subset of packages from the &#x27;main&#x27;, &#x27;contrib&#x27;, &#x27;non-free&#x27; and &#x27;restricted&#x27; sections of the master tree.

In Mandriva Linux 2008, the Discovery and Powerpack+ editions were merged into Powerpack, which became Mandriva&#x27;s only commercial offering. Users were able to choose between a novice-friendly Discovery-like setup or an installation process and desktop aimed at power users.

===Mandriva Linux Discovery===
Mandriva Linux Discovery was a commercial distribution aimed at first-time and novice Linux users. It was sold via the Mandriva Store website and authorized resellers, or could be downloaded by some subscribers to the Mandriva Club. Mandriva Linux 2008 does not include a Discovery edition, having added optional novice-friendly features to the Powerpack edition.

In releases prior to Mandriva Linux 2007, Discovery was a &#x27;traditional&#x27; distribution built on the DrakX installer. In Mandriva Linux 2007 and 2007 Spring, Discovery is a hybrid &quot;Live DVD&quot; which can be booted without installation or installed to hard disk in the traditional manner.

Discovery was a DVD rather than a CD, allowing all languages to be provided on one disc. It consisted of a subset of packages from the &#x27;main&#x27;, &#x27;contrib&#x27;, &#x27;non-free&#x27; and &#x27;non-free-restricted&#x27; sections of the master tree. The package selection was tailored towards novice desktop users. A theme chosen to be appealing to novice users was used, and the &#x27;simplified&#x27; menu layout in which applications are described rather than named and not all applications are included was the default (for all other editions, the default menu layout was the &#x27;traditional&#x27; layout, where all graphical applications installed on the system were included and were listed by name).

===Mandriva Linux Powerpack+===
Mandriva Linux Powerpack+ was a version of Powerpack with additional packages, mostly commercial software. Like Powerpack, it was sold directly from the Mandriva Store website and through authorized resellers; it was also a free download for Mandriva Club members of the Gold level and above. Powerpack+ was aimed at SOHO (small office / home office) users, with the expectation that it could be used to run a small home or office server machine as well as desktop and development workstations. The package selection was tailored with this in mind, including a wide range of server packages. It consisted of a subset of packages from the &#x27;main&#x27;, &#x27;contrib&#x27;, &#x27;non-free&#x27; and &#x27;restricted&#x27; sections of the master tree.

Mandriva 2008 no longer includes a Powerpack+ edition; instead, the Powerpack edition includes all the available packages.

==Derivatives==
Derivatives are distributions that are based on Mandriva Linux, some by Mandriva itself, others by independent projects. Some maintain compatibility with Mandriva Linux, so that installing a Mandriva Linux .rpm also works on the offspring.
* blackPanther OS - initially derived from Mandrake
* OpenMandriva Lx - a continuation of Mandriva by the community
* Mageia - a fork of Mandriva by the former laid off developers
* PCLinuxOS - initially derived from Mandrake
* ROSA Linux - a fork of Mandriva by the former laid off developers

<doc id="19369" wikidata="Q469912" url="?curid=19369" title="Matteo Carcassi">
<text>Matteo Carcassi (8 April 1792 – 16 January 1853) was an Italian guitarist and composer.

==Life==
Carcassi was born in Florence, Italy, and first studied the piano, but learned guitar when still a child. He quickly gained a reputation as a virtuoso concert guitarist.

He moved to Germany in 1810, gaining almost immediate success. By 1815, he was living in Paris, earning his living as a teacher of both the piano and the guitar. On a concert tour in Germany in 1819, he met his friend Jean-Antoine Meissonnier for the first time. Also a well-known guitarist, Meissonnier published many of Carcassi&#x27;s works in his Paris publishing house. For Meissonnier he also arranged a number of popular songs for guitar that were originally written for piano, including works by Théodore Labarre and Loïsa Puget.

From 1820 on, Carcassi spent the majority of his time in Paris. In 1823, he performed an extremely successful series of concerts in London that earned him great fame, both as a performing artist and as a teacher. However, in Paris, a long time passed before his talents were truly recognized, partly because of the presence of Ferdinando Carulli.

Carcassi was in Germany again during autumn 1824. Afterwards he performed in London, where his reputation now gave him access to more prestigious concert halls. Finally he returned to Paris. For several years, he made concert trips from here to the important musical centres of Europe. After a short return to performing in 1836, he quit his concert practice around 1840 and died in Paris in 1853.

==Music==

Carcassi wrote a method for guitar (Op. 59), first published with Schott in Mainz, in 1836. It is still valuable, relevant and interesting. His most famous works are collected in his 25 Études, Op. 60. In these, he managed to blend technical skills and brilliant Romantic music. This is the reason his music is still played by so many classical guitarists today.

<doc id="19370" wikidata="Q35996" url="?curid=19370" title="Mazda">
<text>is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Fuchū, Hiroshima, Japan. The company was founded on January 30, 1920, as Toyo Cork Kogyo Co., Ltd., a cork-making factory, by Jujiro Matsuda. The company then acquired Abemaki Tree Cork Company. It changed its name to Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. in 1927 and started producing vehicles in 1931.

Mazda is known for its innovative technologies, such as the Wankel engine, the SkyActiv platform, and the Kodo Design language. It also has a long history of motorsport involvement, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1991 with the rotary-powered Mazda 787B. In the past and present, Mazda has been engaged in alliances with other automakers. From 1974 until the late 2000s, Ford was a major shareholder of Mazda. Other partnerships include Toyota, Nissan, Isuzu, Suzuki and Kia. In 2023, it produced 1.1 million vehicles globally.

The name Mazda was derived from Ahura Mazda, the god of harmony, intelligence and wisdom in Zoroastrianism, as well as from the surname of the founder, Matsuda.

== History ==
=== Creation ===
Mazda began as the Toyo Cork Kogyo Co., Ltd, as a cork-making factory founded in Hiroshima, Japan, January 30, 1920. Toyo Cork Kogyo renamed itself to Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. in 1927. In the late 1920s the company had to be saved from bankruptcy by Hiroshima Saving Bank and other business leaders in Hiroshima.

In 1931, Toyo Kogyo moved from manufacturing machine tools to vehicles with the introduction of the Mazda-Go auto rickshaw. The name &quot;Mazda&quot; came into existence with the production of the company&#x27;s first three-wheeled trucks. Other candidates for a model name included &quot;Sumera-Go&quot;, &quot;Tenshi-Go&quot;, and more.

Officially, the company states:

The company&#x27;s website further notes that the name also derives from the name of the company&#x27;s founder, Jujiro Matsuda. The alternative proposed names mean &quot;god&quot; (&quot;Sumera&quot;) and &quot;angel&quot; (&quot;Tenshi&quot;); both indicate Matsuda&#x27;s strong interest in human faith.

The Mazda lettering was used in combination with the corporate emblem of Mitsubishi Motors, which was responsible for sales, to produce the Toyo Kogyo three-wheeled truck registered trademark.

Toyo Kogyo produced weapons for the Japanese military throughout the Second World War, most notably the series 30 through 35 Type 99 rifle. The company formally adopted the Mazda name in 1984, though every automobile sold from the beginning bore that name. The Mazda R360 was introduced in 1960, followed by the Mazda Carol in 1962 and were sold at a specific retail dealership that sold passenger cars called &quot;Mazda Auto Store&quot; whereas commercial products were sold at &quot;Mazda Store&quot;. As Mazda continued to offer passenger cars like the Savanna, Familia, Luce, Cosmo and Capella, they were added to the &quot;Mazda Auto Store&quot; network only.

=== Wankel engine adoption ===

Beginning in the 1960s, Mazda was inspired by the NSU Ro 80 and decided to put a major engineering effort into development of the Wankel rotary engine as a way of differentiating itself from other Japanese auto companies. The company formed a business relationship with German company NSU and began with the limited-production Cosmo Sport of 1967, and continuing to the present day with the Pro Mazda Championship, Mazda has become the sole manufacturer of Wankel-type engines for the automotive market, mainly by way of attrition. (NSU and Citroën both gave up on the design during the 1970s, and prototype Corvette efforts by General Motors never made it to production.)

This effort to bring attention to itself apparently helped, as Mazda rapidly began to export its vehicles. Both piston-powered and rotary-powered models made their way around the world. The rotary models quickly became popular for their combination of good power and light weight when compared to piston-engined competitors that required heavier V6 or V8 engines to produce the same power. The R100 and the RX series (RX-2, RX-3, and RX-4) led the company&#x27;s export efforts.

During 1968, Mazda started formal operations in Canada (MazdaCanada) although Mazdas were seen in Canada as early as 1959. In 1970, Mazda formally entered the American market (Mazda North American Operations) and was very successful there, going so far as to create the Mazda Rotary Pickup (based on the conventional piston-powered B-Series model) solely for North American buyers. To this day, Mazda remains the only automaker to have produced a Wankel-powered pickup truck. Additionally, it is also the only brand to have ever offered a rotary-powered bus (the Mazda Parkway, offered only in Japan) or station wagon (within the RX-3 and RX-4 lines for certain markets). After nine years of development, Mazda finally launched its new model in the U.S. in 1970.

Mazda&#x27;s rotary success continued until the onset of the 1973 oil crisis. As American buyers (as well as those in other nations) quickly turned to vehicles with better fuel efficiency, the relatively thirsty rotary-powered models began to fall out of favor. Combined with being the least-efficient automaker in Japan (in terms of productivity), inability to adjust to excess inventory and over-reliance on the U.S. market, the company suffered a huge loss in 1975. An already heavily indebted Toyo Kogyo was on the verge of bankruptcy and was only saved through the intervention of Sumitomo keiretsu group, namely Sumitomo Bank, and the company&#x27;s subcontractors and distributors. However, the company had not totally turned its back on piston engines, as it continued to produce a variety of four-cylinder models throughout the 1970s. The smaller Familia line in particular became very important to Mazda&#x27;s worldwide sales after 1973, as did the somewhat larger Capella series.

Mazda refocused its efforts and made the rotary engine a choice for the sporting motorist rather than a mainstream powerplant. Starting with the lightweight RX-7 in 1978 and continuing with the modern RX-8, Mazda has continued its dedication to this unique powerplant. This switch in focus also resulted in the development of another lightweight sports car, the piston-powered Mazda MX-5 Miata (sold as the Eunos and later Mazda Roadster in Japan), inspired by the concept &#x27;jinba ittai&#x27;. Introduced in 1989 to worldwide acclaim, the Roadster has been widely credited with reviving the concept of the small sports car after its decline in the late 1970s.

=== Partnership with Ford ===
From 1974 to 2015, Mazda had a partnership with the Ford Motor Company, which acquired a 24.5% stake in 1979, upped to a 33.4% ownership of Mazda in May 1995. Under the administration of Alan Mulally, Ford gradually divested its stake in Mazda from 2008 to 2015, with Ford holding 2.1% of Mazda stock as of 2014 and severing most production as well as development ties.

This partnership with Ford began owing to Mazda&#x27;s financial difficulties during the 1960s. Starting in 1979 by expanding their 7 percent financial stake to 24.5%, Ford expanded an existing partnership with Mazda, resulting in various joint projects. The cooperation had begun in 1971 when the Mazda B-Series spawned a Ford Courier variant for North America, a version which was later offered in other markets as well. Mazda&#x27;s Bongo and Titan cab-over trucks were sold with Ford badging in mainly Asia and the Pacific region beginning in 1976. These included large and small efforts in all areas of the automotive landscape, most notably in the realm of pickup trucks and smaller cars. Mazda began supplying manual transaxles to Ford in the spring of 1980. Mazda&#x27;s Familia platform was used for Ford models like the Laser and Escort beginning in 1980, while the Capella architecture found its way into Ford&#x27;s Telstar sedan and Probe sports models.

During the 1980s, Ford-badged Mazda products replaced much of their own European-sourced lineup, especially in the Asia-Pacific markets, with the Laser replacing the Escort and the Telstar replacing the Cortina. In some cases, such as New Zealand and South Africa, these were assembled alongside their Mazda-badged equivalents, the Mazda 323 (Familia) and 626 (Capella).

Following the closure of its own assembly plant in New Zealand, Mazda established a joint venture with Ford New Zealand known as Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ), while in South Africa, Ford&#x27;s local subsidiary merged with Sigma Motor Corporation, which already assembled Mazdas in the country, to form Samcor, although the sharing of models proved unpopular with both Ford and Mazda customers. In other markets such as Australia, however, the 323 and 626 were always fully imported, with only the Laser and Telstar assembled locally. In Japan, the Laser and Telstar were also sold alongside their Mazda-badged brethren, but the Festiva was not sold as a Mazda 121 on the Japanese market.

In North America, the Probe was built in a new Mazda company plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, along with the mainstream 626 sedan and a companion Mazda MX-6 sports coupe. Ford also lent Mazda some of its capacity when needed: the Mazda 121 sold in Europe and South Africa was, for a time, a variant of the Ford Fiesta built in plants in Europe and South Africa. Mazda also made an effort in the past to sell some of Ford&#x27;s cars in Japan, mainly through its Autorama dealer group.

Mazda also helped Ford develop the 1991 Explorer, which Mazda sold as the 2-door only Mazda Navajo from 1991 through 1994. However, Mazda&#x27;s version was unsuccessful, while the Ford (available from the start as a 4-door or 2-door model) instantly became the best-selling sport-utility vehicle in the United States and kept that title for over a decade. Mazda has used Ford&#x27;s Ranger pickup as the basis for its North American–market B-Series trucks, starting in 1994 and continuing through 2010, when Mazda discontinued the B-Series trucks to North America.

Following its long-held fascination with alternative engine technology, Mazda introduced the first Miller cycle engine for automotive use in the Millenia luxury sedan of 1995. Though the Millenia (and its Miller-type V6 engine) were discontinued in 2002, the company introduced a much smaller Miller-cycle four-cylinder engine for use in its Demio in 2008.

Further financial difficulties at Mazda during the 1990s () caused Ford to increase its stake to a 33.4-percent controlling interest in May 1996. In June 1996, Henry Wallace was appointed president, and he set about restructuring Mazda and setting it on a new strategic direction. He laid out a new direction for the brand including the design of the present Mazda marque; he laid out a new product plan to achieve synergies with Ford, and he launched Mazda&#x27;s digital innovation program to speed up the development of new products. At the same time, he started taking control of overseas distributors, rationalized dealerships and manufacturing facilities, and driving much-needed efficiencies and cost reductions in Mazda&#x27;s operations. Much of his early work put Mazda back into profitability and laid the foundations for future success. Wallace was succeeded by James Miller in November 1997, followed in December 1999 by Ford executive Mark Fields, who has been credited with expanding Mazda&#x27;s new product lineup and leading the turnaround during the early 2000s. Ford&#x27;s increased influence during the 1990s allowed Mazda to claim another distinction in history, having maintained the first foreign-born head of a Japanese car company, Henry Wallace.

=== Divestment by Ford ===
Amid the world financial crisis in the fall of 2008, reports emerged that Ford was contemplating a sale of its stake in Mazda as a way of streamlining its asset base. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; explained the alliance between Ford and Mazda has been a very successful one, with Mazda saving perhaps $90 million a year in development costs and Ford &quot;several times&quot; that, and that a sale of its stake in Mazda would be a desperate measure. On November 18, 2008, Ford announced that it would sell a 20% stake in Mazda, reducing its stake to 13.4%, thus surrendering control of the company, which it held since 1996. The following day, Mazda announced that, as part of the deal, it was buying back 6.8% of its shares from Ford for about US$185 million while the rest would be acquired by business partners of the company. It was also reported that Hisakazu Imaki would be stepping down as chief executive, to be replaced by Takashi Yamanouchi. On November 18, 2010, Ford reduced its stake further to 3%, citing the reduction of ownership would allow greater flexibility to pursue growth in emerging markets, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group was believed to become its largest shareholder. Ford and Mazda remained strategic partners through joint ventures and exchanges of technological information.

On September 30, 2015, when Ford&#x27;s shares had sunk to a little over 2% due to stock dilution, Ford sold its remaining shares in Mazda.

=== Post-Ford efforts ===
In 2011, Mazda raised more than 150 billion yen (US$1.9 billion) in a record share sale to replenish capital, as it suffered its biggest annual loss in 11 years. Part of the proceeds were used to build an auto plant in Salamanca, Mexico. The Mexican plant was built jointly by the company and Sumitomo Corporation.

In May 2015, the company signed an agreement with Toyota to form a &quot;long-term partnership&quot;, that would, among others, see Mazda supply Toyota with fuel-efficient SkyActiv gasoline and diesel engine technology in exchange for hydrogen fuel cell systems.

== Brands ==


Mazda tried using a number of different brands in the Japanese (and occasionally Australian) markets in the 1990s, including Autozam, Eunos, and ɛ̃fini. The motivation was brought on by market competition from other Japanese automakers efforts in offering vehicles at multiple Japanese dealership networks offered by Toyota, Nissan, and Honda. Mazda&#x27;s implementation of brand diversification reflected a Japanese engineering philosophy, called Kansei engineering, which was used as an advertising slogan in North America.

One of the most niche sub-brands was M2, used on three rare variants of the Eunos Roadster (the M2-1001, M2-1002 and M2-1028) and one of the Autozam AZ-1 (M2-1015). M2 even had its own avant-garde company headquarters, but was shut down after a very short period of operation.

In early 1992, Mazda planned to release a luxury brand, Amati, to challenge Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus in North America, which was to begin selling in late 1993. The initial Amati range would have included the Amati 500 (which became the Eunos 800 in Japan and Australia, Mazda Millenia in the U.S., and Mazda Xedos 9 in Europe), a rebadged version of the Mazda Cosmo and the Amati 1000 (a rear-wheel drive V12 competitor to the Lexus LS400). The Amati brand was eventually scrapped before any cars hit the market.

In Europe, the Xedos name was also associated with the Mazda Xedos 6, the two models were in production from 1992 until 1997. The Xedos line was marketed under the Mazda brand, and used the Mazda badge from the corresponding years.

This diversification stressed the product development groups at Mazda past its limits. Instead of having a half-dozen variations on any given platform, developers were asked to work on dozens of different models at the same time. Consumers were confused as well by the explosion of similar new models. This selective marketing experiment was ended in the mid-1990s due to economic conditions, largely attributed to the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991.

== Markets ==

, the United States is Mazda&#x27;s biggest market, followed by China and Japan. Mazda&#x27;s market share in the U.S. fell to a 10-year low of 1.7 percent in 2016. Mazda&#x27;s brand loyalty was 39 percent in 2016, below the industry average of 53 percent. On October 24, 2022, Mazda decided to get rid of assets in Russia, with the company transferring a stake in a joint venture in Vladivostok to Sollers JSC for 1 euro.

== Environmental efforts ==

Mazda has conducted research in hydrogen-powered vehicles for several decades. Mazda has developed a hybrid version of its Premacy compact minivan using a version of its signature rotary engine that can run on hydrogen or gasoline named the Mazda Premacy Hydrogen RE Hybrid. Despite plans to release it in 2008, as of 2010 the vehicle is in limited trials.

In 2010, Toyota and Mazda announced a supply agreement for the hybrid technology used in Toyota&#x27;s Prius model.

=== Bio-car ===

Mazda is finding uses for biomaterials in its vehicles, including both plastics and fabrics made from corn starch, as it aims to become more environmentally-friendly. Mazda introduced some of these innovations (bioplastic internal consoles and bio-fabric seats) in its Mazda5 model at EcoInnovasia 2008, at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center in Bangkok. Up to 30% of the interior parts in the Mazda5 are made of biomaterial components.

=== SkyActiv technology ===

SkyActiv technology is an umbrella name for a range of technologies used in certain new Mazda vehicles. These vehicles include the Mazda2/Demio, Mazda3/Axela, Mazda6/Atenza, and CX-5. Together these technologies increase fuel economy to a level similar to a hybrid drivetrain. Engine output is increased and emission levels are reduced. These technologies include high compression ratio gasoline engines (13.0 to 1), reduced compression diesel engines (14.0 to 1) with new 2-stage turbocharger design, highly efficient automatic transmissions, lighter weight manual transmissions, lightweight body designs and electric power steering. It is also possible to combine these technologies with a hybrid drivetrain for even greater fuel economy.

== Motorsport ==
In the racing world, Mazda has had substantial success with both its signature Wankel-engine cars (in two-rotor, three-rotor, and four-rotor forms) as well as its piston-engine models. Mazda vehicles and engines compete in a wide variety of disciplines and series around the world. In 1991, Mazda became the first Japanese automaker to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans overall.

=== International competition ===

Mazda&#x27;s competition debut was on October 20, 1968, when two Mazda Cosmo Sport 110S coupes entered the 84-hour Marathon de la Route ultra-endurance race at the Nürburgring, one finishing in fourth place and the other breaking an axle after 81 hours. The next year, Mazda raced Mazda Familia R100 M10A coupes. After winning the Singapore Grand Prix in April 1969 and coming in fifth and sixth in the Spa 24 Hours (beaten only by Porsche 911s), on October 19, 1969, Mazda again entered the 84 hour Nürburgring race with four Familias. Only one of these finished, taking fifth place.

The first racing victory by a Wankel-engined car in the United States was in 1973, when Pat Bedard won an IMSA RS race at Lime Rock Park in a Mazda RX-2.

In 1976, Ray Walle, owner of Z&amp;W Mazda, drove a Cosmo (Mazda RX-5) from the dealership in Princeton, New Jersey, to Daytona, won the Touring Class Under 2.5 Liters at the 24 Hours of Daytona, and drove the car back to New Jersey. The Cosmo placed 18th overall in a field of 72. The only modifications were racing brake pads, exhaust, and safety equipment.

After substantial successes by the Mazda RX-2 and Mazda RX-3, the Mazda RX-7 has won more IMSA races in its class than any other model of automobile, with its hundredth victory on September 2, 1990. Following that, the RX-7 won its class in the IMSA 24 Hours of Daytona race ten years in a row, starting in 1982. The RX-7 won the IMSA Grand Touring Under Two Liter (GTU) championship each year from 1980 through 1987, inclusive.

In 1991, a four-rotor Mazda 787B (2622 cc actual, rated by FIA formula at 4708 cc) won the 24 Hours of Le Mans auto race outright. The 787B&#x27;s triumph remains unparalleled, as it remains the only non-piston-engined car ever to win at Le Mans, and Mazda is the first Japanese brand to have won overall at Le Mans. This led to a ban on rotary engines in the Le Mans race starting in 1992, which has since been rescinded. After the 1991 race, the winning engine was publicly dismantled for internal examination, which demonstrated that despite 24 hours of extremely hard use it had accumulated very little wear.

The Le Mans win in 1991 followed a decade of class wins from other Mazda prototypes, including the 757 and 767. The Sigma MC74 powered by a Mazda 12A engine was the first engine and team from outside Western Europe or the United States to finish the entire 24 hours of the Le Mans race, in 1974. Mazda is also the most reliable finisher at Le Mans (with the exception of Honda, which has entered only three cars in only one year), with 67% of entries finishing. Mazda returned to prototype racing in 2005 with the introduction of the Courage C65 LMP2 car at the American Le Mans Series race at Road Atlanta. This prototype racer uses the Renesis Wankel from the RX-8.

Mazdas have also enjoyed substantial success in World Land Speed competition, SCCA competition, drag racing, pro rally competition (the Familia appeared in the WRC several times during the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s), the One Lap of America race (winning SUV &amp; truck in a MazdaSpeed5), and other venues. Wankel engines have been banned for some time from international Formula One racing, as well as from United States midget racing, after Gene Angelillo won the North East Midget Racing Association championship in 1985 with a car powered by a 13B engine, and again in 1986 in a car powered by a 12A engine.

=== Spec series ===

The Cooper Tires Atlantic Championship powered by Mazda is a North American open wheel racing series. It is the top level of the MAZDASPEED ladder, a driver development program which rewards season winners of one level with automatic rides at the next level. Since 2006, the Atlantic Championship has been run exclusively with Swift 016.a chassis powered by Mazda-Cosworth MZR 2300 cc (2.3L) DOHC inline-4 engines producing . The cars are capable of speeds in excess of .

Formula Mazda features open wheel race cars with Mazda engines, adaptable to both oval tracks and road courses, on several levels of competition. Since 1991, the professionally organized Pro Mazda Championship has been the most popular format for sponsors, spectators, and upward bound drivers. It is the second-highest level on the aforementioned Mazdaspeed driver development ladder. Engines for the Star Mazda series are all built by one engine builder, certified to produce the prescribed power, and sealed to discourage tampering. They are in a relatively mild state of racing tune, so that they are extremely reliable and can go years between motor rebuilds.

Spec Miata has become one of the most popular and most affordable road racing classes in North America. The Spec Miata (SM) class is intended to provide the opportunity to compete in low-cost, production-based cars with limited modifications, suitable for racing competition. The rules are intentionally designed to be more open than the Showroom Stock class but more restricted than the Improved Touring class.

Spec RX-7 is also a popular club racing class primarily due to the availability of first-generation RX-7 cars and the low startup cost.

== Sponsorships ==
Mazda is a major sponsor to several professional sports teams, including:

*Hometown teams:
**Sanfrecce Hiroshima (J. League): Originally known as Toyo Kogyo Soccer Club and founded in 1938, it was owned directly by Mazda until 1992 when Mazda reduced its share to professionalize the club for the new J. League.
**Hiroshima Toyo Carp (Nippon Professional Baseball): The &quot;Toyo&quot; part of the team&#x27;s name is in honor of Mazda&#x27;s part-ownership of the team since 1968 (when Mazda was still known as Toyo Kogyo). The Matsuda family, descended from the founder of Mazda, holds the majority share in team ownership.
*Teams abroad:
**North Melbourne Football Club (Australian Football League)
**AS Roma (Serie A)
**ACF Fiorentina (Serie A)
**SK Sigma Olomouc (Czech First League)
**Nakhon Ratchasima (Thai League 1)

The company also sponsors various marathon and relay race events in Japan, such as the Hiroshima International Peace Marathon and the Hiroshima Prefectural Ekiden Race, along with numerous other sporting and charity endeavors in Hiroshima and Hofu. Mazda was also the league sponsor for the now-defunct Australian Rugby Championship.

Mazda maintained sponsorship of the Laguna Seca racing course in California from 2001 until February 2018, going so far as to use it for its own automotive testing purposes as well as the numerous racing events (including several Mazda-specific series) that it used to host, as well as for the 2003 launch of the Mazda RX-8. Since April 2018, the venue&#x27;s primary corporate sponsor is WeatherTech.

Mazda also sponsors the Western New York Flash, a professional women&#x27;s soccer team that plays in the WPA and has some of the best players in the world, including world player of the year.

Mazda has been a sponsor of Club Deportivo Universidad Católica&#x27;s basketball team of the Liga Nacional de Básquetbol de Chile.

== Marketing ==

Mazda&#x27;s past advertising slogans included: &quot;The more you look, the more you like&quot; (1970s to early 1980s); &quot;Experience Mazda&quot; (mid-1980s); &quot;An intense commitment to your total satisfaction, that&#x27;s The Mazda Way&quot; (late 1980s); &quot;It Just Feels Right&quot; along with advertising describing Mazda&#x27;s use of Kansei engineering (1990–1995); &quot;Passion for the road&quot; (1996); &quot;Get in. Be moved.&quot; (1997–2000). Another marketing slogan was &quot;Sakes Alive!&quot;, for its truck line.

Since 2000, Mazda has used the phrase &quot;Zoom-Zoom&quot; to describe what it calls the &quot;emotion of motion&quot; that it claims is inherent in its cars. Extremely successful and long-lasting (when compared to other automotive marketing taglines), the Zoom-Zoom campaign has now spread around the world from its initial use in North America.

The Zoom-Zoom campaign has been accompanied by the &quot;Zoom-Zoom-Zoom&quot; song in many television and radio advertisements. The original version, performed by Jibril Serapis Bey (used in commercials in Europe, Japan and South Africa), was recorded long before it became the official song for Mazda as part of a soundtrack to the movie &quot;Only The Strong&quot; (released in 1993). The Serapis Bey version is a cover of a traditional Capoeira song, called &quot;Capoeira Mata Um&quot;. In 2010, its current slogan is &quot;Zoom Zoom Forever&quot;. The longer slogan (Used in TV ads) is &quot;Zoom Zoom, Today, Tomorrow, Forever&quot;.

Early ads in the Zoom-Zoom campaign also featured a young boy (Micah Kanters) whispering the &quot;Zoom-Zoom&quot; tagline.

Since 2011, Mazda has still used the Zoom-Zoom tagline in another campaign called &quot;What Do You Drive?&quot;. The punchline for this is &quot;We believe if it&#x27;s not worth driving, it&#x27;s not worth building. We build Mazdas. What do you drive?&quot;

In 2015, Mazda had launched a new campaign under a new tagline, &quot;Driving Matters&quot;, coinciding with the release of the redesigned MX-5. This campaign was meant to solidify Mazda&#x27;s &quot;Zoom Zoom&quot; slogan. A 60-second long advertisement titled &quot;A Driver&#x27;s Life&quot;, coincided with the new tagline on the following week.

<text>Minute is a unit of time defined as equal to 60 seconds.
One hour contains 60 minutes.
Although not a unit in the International System of Units (SI), the minute is accepted for use in the SI. The SI symbol for minutes is min (without a dot). The prime symbol is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes.
In the UTC time standard, a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds, a consequence of leap seconds; there is also a provision to insert a negative leap second, which would result in a 59-second minute, but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system.

==History==
Al-Biruni first subdivided the hour sexagesimally into minutes, seconds, thirds and fourths in 1000 CE while discussing Jewish months.

Historically, the word &quot;minute&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;pars minuta prima&quot;, meaning &quot;first small part&quot;. This division of the hour can be further refined with a &quot;second small part&quot; (Latin: &quot;pars minuta secunda&quot;), and this is where the word &quot;second&quot; comes from. For even further refinement, the term &quot;third&quot; ( of a second) remains in some languages, for example Polish (&quot;tercja&quot;) and Turkish (&quot;salise&quot;), although most modern usage subdivides seconds by using decimals. The symbol notation of the prime for minutes and double prime for seconds can be seen as indicating the first and second cut of the hour (similar to how the foot is the first cut of the yard or perhaps chain, with inches as the second cut). In 1267, the medieval scientist Roger Bacon, writing in Latin, defined the division of time between full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (&quot;horae&quot;, &quot;minuta&quot;, &quot;secunda&quot;, &quot;tertia&quot;, and &quot;quarta&quot;) after noon on specified calendar dates. Jost Bürgi was the first clock maker to include a minute hand on clock for astronomer Tycho Brahe in 1577. The introduction of the minute hand into watches was possible only after the invention of the hairspring by Thomas Tompion, an English watchmaker, in 1675.

<doc id="19373" wikidata="Q212639" url="?curid=19373" title="Maurice Merleau-Ponty">
<text>Maurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty (; ; 14 March 1908 – 3 May 1961) was a French phenomenological philosopher, strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception, art, politics, religion, biology, psychology, psychoanalysis, language, nature, and history. He was the lead editor of &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;, the leftist magazine he established with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in 1945.

At the core of Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role that perception plays in the human experience of the world. Merleau-Ponty understands perception to be an ongoing dialogue between one&#x27;s lived body and the world which it perceives, in which perceivers passively and actively strive to express the perceived world in concert with others. He was the only major phenomenologist of the first half of the twentieth century to engage extensively with the sciences. It is through this engagement that his writings became influential in the project of naturalising phenomenology, in which phenomenologists use the results of psychology and cognitive science.

Merleau-Ponty emphasised the body as the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of knowledge, and maintained that the perceiving body and its perceived world could not be disentangled from each other. The articulation of the primacy of embodiment (&quot;corporéité&quot;) led him away from phenomenology towards what he was to call &quot;indirect ontology&quot; or the ontology of &quot;the flesh of the world&quot; (&quot;la chair du monde&quot;), seen in his final and incomplete work, &quot;The Visible and Invisible&quot;, and his last published essay, &quot;Eye and Mind&quot;.

Merleau-Ponty engaged with Marxism throughout his career. His 1947 book, &quot;Humanism and Terror&quot;, has been widely understood as defense of the Moscow Trials. Slavoj Zizek opines that it avoids the definitive endorsement of a view on the Soviet Union, but instead engages with the Marxist theory of history as a critique of liberalism, in order to reveal an unresolved antinomy in modern politics, between humanism and terror: if human values can only be achieved through violent force, and if liberal ideas hide illiberal realities, how is just political action to be decided? Merleau-Ponty maintained an engaged though critical relationship to the Marxist left until the end of his life, particularly during his time as the political editor of the journal &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;.

==Life==

Maurice Merleau-Ponty was born in 1908 in Rochefort-sur-Mer, Charente-Inférieure (now Charente-Maritime), France. His father died in 1913 when Merleau-Ponty was five years old. After secondary schooling at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, Merleau-Ponty became a student at the École Normale Supérieure, where he studied alongside Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Simone Weil, Jean Hyppolite, and Jean Wahl. As Beauvoir recounts in her autobiography, she developed a close friendship with Merleau-Ponty and became smitten with him, but ultimately found him too well-adjusted to bourgeois life and values for her taste. He attended Edmund Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Paris Lectures&quot; in February 1929. In 1929, Merleau-Ponty received his DES degree (&quot;&quot;, roughly equivalent to a M.A. thesis) from the University of Paris, on the basis of the (now-lost) thesis &quot;La Notion de multiple intelligible chez Plotin&quot; (&quot;Plotinus&#x27;s Notion of the Intelligible Many&quot;), directed by Émile Bréhier. He passed the agrégation in philosophy in 1930.

Merleau-Ponty was raised as a Roman Catholic. He was friends with the Christian existentialist author and philosopher Gabriel Marcel and wrote articles for the Christian leftist journal &quot;Esprit&quot;, but he left the Catholic Church in 1937 because he felt his socialist politics were not compatible with the social and political doctrine of the Catholic Church.

An article published in the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; in October 2014 makes the case of recent discoveries about Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s likely authorship of the novel &quot;Nord. Récit de l&#x27;arctique&quot; (Grasset, 1928). Convergent sources from close friends (Beauvoir, Elisabeth &quot;Zaza&quot; Lacoin) seem to leave little doubt that Jacques Heller was a pseudonym of the 20-year-old Merleau-Ponty.

Merleau-Ponty taught first at the Lycée de Beauvais (1931–33) and then got a fellowship to do research from the . From 1934 to 1935 he taught at the Lycée de Chartres. He then in 1935 became a tutor at the École Normale Supérieure, where he tutored a young Michel Foucault and Trần Đức Thảo and was awarded his doctorate on the basis of two important books: &quot;La structure du comportement&quot; (1942) and &quot;Phénoménologie de la Perception&quot; (1945). During this time, he attended Alexandre Kojeve&#x27;s influential seminars on Hegel and Aron Gurwitsch&#x27;s lectures on Gestalt psychology.

In the spring of 1939, he was the first foreign visitor to the newly established Husserl Archives, where he consulted Husserl&#x27;s unpublished manuscripts and met Eugen Fink and Herman Van Breda. In the summer of 1939, as France declared war on Nazi Germany, he served on the frontlines in the French Army, where he was wounded in battle in June 1940. Upon returning to Paris in the fall of 1940, he married Suzanne Jolibois, a Lacanian psychoanalyst, and founded an underground resistance group with Jean-Paul Sartre called &quot;Under the Boot&quot;. He participated in an armed demonstration against the Nazi forces during the liberation of Paris. After teaching at the University of Lyon from 1945 to 1948, Merleau-Ponty lectured on child psychology and education at the Sorbonne from 1949 to 1952. He was awarded the Chair of Philosophy at the Collège de France from 1952 until his death in 1961, making him the youngest person to have been elected to a chair.

Besides his teaching, Merleau-Ponty was also political editor for the leftist journal &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot; from its founding in October 1945 until December 1952. In his youth, he had read Karl Marx&#x27;s writings and Sartre even claimed that Merleau-Ponty converted him to Marxism. E. K. Kuby states that while Merleau-Ponty was not a member of the French Communist Party and did not identify as a Communist, he laid out an argument justifying the Moscow Trials and political violence for progressive ends in general in the work &quot;Humanism and Terror&quot; in 1947. Kuby states that, about three years after that, however, he renounced his earlier support for political violence, rejected Marxism, and advocated a liberal left position in &quot;Adventures of the Dialectic&quot; (1955). His friendship with Sartre and work with &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot; ended because of that, since Sartre still had a more favourable attitude towards Soviet communism. Merleau-Ponty was subsequently active in the French non-communist left and in particular in the Union of the Democratic Forces.

Merleau-Ponty died suddenly of a stroke in 1961 at age 53, apparently while preparing for a class on René Descartes, leaving an unfinished manuscript which was posthumously published in 1964, along with a selection of Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s working notes, by Claude Lefort as &quot;The Visible and the Invisible&quot;. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with his mother Louise, his wife Suzanne and their daughter Marianne.

==Thought==
===Consciousness===
In his &quot;Phenomenology of Perception&quot; (first published in French in 1945), Merleau-Ponty develops the concept of the body-subject (&quot;le corps propre&quot;) as an alternative to the Cartesian &quot;cogito&quot;. This distinction is especially important in that Merleau-Ponty perceives the essences of the world existentially. Consciousness, the world, and the human body as a perceiving thing are intricately intertwined and mutually &quot;engaged&quot;. The phenomenal thing is not the unchanging object of the natural sciences, but a correlate of the human body and its sensory-motor functions. Taking up and &quot;communing with&quot; (Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s phrase) the sensible qualities it encounters, the body as incarnated subjectivity intentionally elaborates things within an ever-present world frame, through use of its pre-conscious, pre-predicative understanding of the world&#x27;s makeup. The elaboration, however, is &quot;inexhaustible&quot; (the hallmark of any perception according to Merleau-Ponty). Things are that upon which the body has a &quot;grip&quot; (&quot;prise&quot;), while the grip itself is a function of human connaturality with the world&#x27;s things. The world and the sense of self are emergent phenomena in an ongoing &quot;becoming&quot;.

The essential partiality of the view of things, their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, as there is no other way for things to be copresent in the world and with other things than through such &quot;Abschattungen&quot; (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations). The thing transcends perception, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself to a range of possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its background—to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz&#x27;s monads). Through involvement in the world – being-in-the-world – the perceiver tacitly experiences all the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment, as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.

Each object is a &quot;mirror of all others&quot;. The perception of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional, or clearly delineated, perception; rather, it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the body&#x27;s primordial involvement and understanding of the world and of the meanings that constitute the landscape&#x27;s perceptual &quot;&quot;. Only after an integration within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can attention be turned toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly. This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new &quot;Gestalt&quot; oriented toward a particular object. Because the bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, meaningful things are encountered in a unified though ever open-ended world.

===The primacy of perception===
From the time of writing &quot;Structure of Behaviour&quot; and &quot;Phenomenology of Perception&quot;, Merleau-Ponty wanted to show, in opposition to the idea that drove the tradition beginning with John Locke, that perception was not the causal product of atomic sensations. This atomist-causal conception was being perpetuated in certain psychological currents of the time, particularly in behaviourism. According to Merleau-Ponty, perception has an active dimension, in that it is a primordial openness to the lifeworld (the &quot;Lebenswelt&quot;).

This primordial openness is at the heart of his thesis of the primacy of perception. The slogan of Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology is &quot;all consciousness is consciousness of something&quot;, which implies a distinction between &quot;acts of thought&quot; (the noesis) and &quot;intentional objects of thought&quot; (the noema). Thus, the correlation between noesis and noema becomes the first step in the constitution of analyses of consciousness. However, in studying the posthumous manuscripts of Husserl, who remained one of his major influences, Merleau-Ponty remarked that, in their evolution, Husserl&#x27;s work brings to light phenomena which are not assimilable to noesis–noema correlation. This is particularly the case when one attends to the phenomena of the body (which is at once body-subject and body-object), subjective time (the consciousness of time is neither an act of consciousness nor an object of thought) and the other (the first considerations of the other in Husserl led to solipsism).

The distinction between &quot;acts of thought&quot; (noesis) and &quot;intentional objects of thought&quot; (noema) does not seem, therefore, to constitute an irreducible ground. It appears rather at a higher level of analysis. Thus, Merleau-Ponty does not postulate that &quot;all consciousness is consciousness of something&quot;, which supposes at the outset a noetic-noematic ground. Instead, he develops the thesis according to which &quot;all consciousness is perceptual consciousness&quot;. In doing so, he establishes a significant turn in the development of phenomenology, indicating that its conceptualisations should be re-examined in the light of the primacy of perception, in weighing up the philosophical consequences of this thesis.

===Corporeity===

Taking the study of perception as his point of departure, Merleau-Ponty was led to recognize that one&#x27;s own body (&quot;le corps propre&quot;) is not only a thing, a potential object of study for science, but is also a permanent condition of experience, a constituent of the perceptual openness to the world. He therefore underlines the fact that there is an inherence of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account. The primacy of perception signifies a primacy of experience, so to speak, insofar as perception becomes an active and constitutive dimension.

Merleau-Ponty demonstrates a corporeity of consciousness as much as an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them. In the &quot;Phenomenology of Perception&quot; Merleau-Ponty wrote: &quot;Insofar as I have hands, feet, a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a way that I do not choose&quot; (1962, p. 440).

===Spatiality===
The question concerning corporeity connects also with Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s reflections on space (&quot;l&#x27;espace&quot;) and the primacy of the dimension of depth (&quot;la profondeur&quot;) as implied in the notion of &quot;being in the world&quot; (&quot;être au monde&quot;; to echo Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;In-der-Welt-sein&quot;) and of one&#x27;s own body (&quot;le corps propre&quot;). Reflections on spatiality in phenomenology are also central to the advanced philosophical deliberations in architectural theory.

===Language===
The highlighting of the fact that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the ego is one of the conclusions of &quot;The Structure of Behaviour&quot; that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s later works. Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject is in a position to undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one&#x27;s cultural life.
He carefully considers language, then, as the core of culture, by examining in particular the connections between the unfolding of thought and sense—enriching his perspective not only by an analysis of the acquisition of language and the expressivity of the body, but also by taking into account pathologies of language, painting, cinema, literature, poetry, and music.

This work deals mainly with language, beginning with the reflection on artistic expression in &quot;The Structure of Behavior&quot;—which contains a passage on El Greco (p. 203ff) that prefigures the remarks that he develops in &quot;Cézanne&#x27;s Doubt&quot; (1945) and follows the discussion in &quot;Phenomenology of Perception&quot;. The work, undertaken while serving as the Chair of Child Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of the Sorbonne, is not a departure from his philosophical and phenomenological works, but rather an important continuation in the development of his thought.

As the course outlines of his Sorbonne lectures indicate, during this period he continues a dialogue between phenomenology and the diverse work carried out in psychology, all in order to return to the study of the acquisition of language in children, as well as to broadly take advantage of the contribution of Ferdinand de Saussure to linguistics, and to work on the notion of structure through a discussion of work in psychology, linguistics and social anthropology.

===Art===
Merleau-Ponty distinguishes between primary and secondary modes of expression. This distinction appears in &quot;Phenomenology of Perception&quot; (p. 207, 2nd note [Fr. ed.]) and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language () (&quot;The Prose of the World&quot;, p. 10). Spoken language (), or secondary expression, returns to the speaker&#x27;s linguistic baggage and cultural heritage, as well as the brute mass of relationships between signs and significations. Speaking language (), or primary expression, such as it is, is language in the production of a sense, language at the advent of a thought, at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense.

It is speaking language, that is to say, primary expression, that interests Merleau-Ponty and which keeps his attention through his treatment of the nature of production and the reception of expressions, a subject which also overlaps with an analysis of action, of intentionality, of perception, as well as the links between freedom and external conditions.

The notion of style occupies an important place in &quot;Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence&quot;. In spite of certain similarities with André Malraux, Merleau-Ponty distinguishes himself from Malraux in respect to three conceptions of style, the last of which is employed in Malraux&#x27;s &quot;The Voices of Silence&quot;. Merleau-Ponty remarks that in this work &quot;style&quot; is sometimes used by Malraux in a highly subjective sense, understood as a projection of the artist&#x27;s individuality. Sometimes it is used, on the contrary, in a very metaphysical sense (in Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s opinion, a mystical sense), in which style is connected with a conception of an &quot;über-artist&quot; expressing &quot;the Spirit of Painting&quot;. Finally, it sometimes is reduced to simply designating a categorization of an artistic school or movement. (However, this account of Malraux&#x27;s notion of style—a key element in his thinking—is open to serious question.)

For Merleau-Ponty, it is these uses of the notion of style that lead Malraux to postulate a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty, it is important to consider the heart of this problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. (However, Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux&#x27;s theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux.) For Merleau-Ponty, style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature.

===Science===
In his essay &quot;Cézanne&#x27;s Doubt&quot;, in which he identifies Paul Cézanne&#x27;s impressionistic theory of painting as analogous to his own concept of radical reflection, the attempt to return to, and reflect on, prereflective consciousness, Merleau-Ponty identifies science as the opposite of art. In Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s account, whereas art is an attempt to capture an individual&#x27;s perception, science is anti-individualistic. In the preface to his &quot;Phenomenology of Perception&quot;, Merleau-Ponty presents a phenomenological objection to positivism: that it can reveal nothing about human subjectivity. All that a scientific text can explain is the particular individual experience of that scientist, which cannot be transcended. For Merleau-Ponty, science neglects the depth and profundity of the phenomena that it endeavors to explain.

Merleau-Ponty understood science to be an &quot;ex post facto&quot; abstraction. Causal and physiological accounts of perception, for example, explain perception in terms that are arrived at only after abstracting from the phenomenon itself. Merleau-Ponty chastised science for taking itself to be the area in which a complete account of nature may be given. The subjective depth of phenomena cannot be given in science as it is. This characterizes Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s attempt to ground science in phenomenological objectivity and, in essence, to institute a &quot;return to the phenomena&quot;.

Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s critical position with respect to science was stated in his Preface to the &quot;Phenomenology&quot;: he described scientific points of view as &quot;always both naive and at the same time dishonest&quot;. Despite, or perhaps because of, this view, his work influenced and anticipated the strands of modern psychology known as post-cognitivism. Hubert Dreyfus has been instrumental in emphasising the relevance of Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s work to current post-cognitive research, and its criticism of the traditional view of cognitive science.

Dreyfus&#x27;s seminal critique of cognitivism (or the computational account of the mind), &quot;What Computers Can&#x27;t Do&quot;, consciously replays Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s critique of intellectualist psychology to argue for the irreducibility of corporeal know-how to discrete, syntactic processes. Through the influence of Dreyfus&#x27;s critique and neurophysiological alternative, Merleau-Ponty became associated with neurophysiological, connectionist accounts of cognition.

With the publication in 1991 of &quot;The Embodied Mind&quot; by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch, this association was extended, if only partially, to another strand of &quot;anti-cognitivist&quot; or post-representationalist cognitive science: embodied or enactive cognitive science, and later in the decade, to neurophenomenology. In addition, Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s work has also influenced researchers trying to integrate neuroscience with the principles of chaos theory.

It was through this relationship with Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s work that cognitive science&#x27;s affair with phenomenology was born, which is represented by a growing number of works, including
* Ron McClamrock, &quot;Existential Cognition: Computational Minds in the World&quot; (1995)
* Andy Clark, &quot;Being There&quot; (1997)
* Jean Petitot et al. (eds.), &quot;Naturalizing Phenomenology&quot; (1999)
* Alva Noë, &quot;Action in Perception&quot; (2004)
* Shaun Gallagher, &quot;How the Body Shapes the Mind&quot; (2005)
* Franck Grammont, Dorothée Legrand, and Pierre Livet (eds.), &quot;Naturalizing Intention in Action&quot; (2010)
* The journal &quot;Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences&quot;

===Feminist philosophy===
Merleau-Ponty has also been picked up by Australian and Nordic philosophers inspired by the French feminist tradition, including Rosalyn Diprose and .

Heinämaa has argued for a rereading of Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s influence on Simone de Beauvoir. (She has also challenged Dreyfus&#x27;s reading of Merleau-Ponty as behaviorist, and as neglecting the importance of the phenomenological reduction to Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s thought.)

Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s phenomenology of the body has also been taken up by Iris Young in her essay &quot;Throwing Like a Girl,&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;&#x27;Throwing Like a Girl&#x27;: Twenty Years Later&quot;. Young analyzes the particular modalities of feminine bodily comportment as they differ from that of men. Young observes that while a man who throws a ball puts his whole body into the motion, a woman throwing a ball generally restricts her own movements as she makes them, and that, generally, in sports, women move in a more tentative, reactive way. Merleau-Ponty argues that people experience the world in terms of the &quot;I can&quot; – that is, oriented towards certain projects based on capacity and habituality. Young&#x27;s thesis is that in women, this intentionality is inhibited and ambivalent, rather than confident, experienced as an &quot;I cannot&quot;.

===Ecophenomenology===
Ecophenomenology can be described as the pursuit of the relationalities of worldly engagement, both human and those of other creatures (Brown &amp; Toadvine 2003).

This engagement is situated in a kind of middle ground of relationality, a space that is neither purely objective, because it is reciprocally constituted by a diversity of lived experiences motivating the movements of countless organisms, nor purely subjective, because it is nonetheless a field of material relationships between bodies. It is governed exclusively neither by causality, nor by intentionality. In this space of in-betweenness, phenomenology can overcome its inaugural opposition to naturalism.

David Abram explains Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s concept of &quot;flesh&quot; (&quot;chair&quot;) as &quot;the mysterious tissue or matrix that underlies and gives rise to both the perceiver and the perceived as interdependent aspects of its spontaneous activity&quot;, and he identifies this elemental matrix with the interdependent web of earthly life. This concept unites subject and object dialectically as determinations within a more primordial reality, which Merleau-Ponty calls &quot;the flesh&quot; and which Abram refers to variously as &quot;the animate earth&quot;, &quot;the breathing biosphere&quot; or &quot;the more-than-human natural world&quot;. Yet this is not nature or the biosphere conceived as a complex set of objects and objective processes, but rather &quot;the biosphere as it is experienced and &quot;lived from within&quot; by the intelligent body — by the attentive human animal who is entirely a part of the world that he or she experiences. Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s ecophenemonology with its emphasis on holistic dialog within the larger-than-human world also has implications for the ontogenesis and phylogenesis of language; indeed he states that &quot;language is the very voice of the trees, the waves and the forest&quot;.

Merleau-Ponty himself refers to &quot;that primordial being which is not yet the subject-being nor the object-being and which in every respect baffles reflection. From this primordial being to us, there is no derivation, nor any break...&quot; Among the many working notes found on his desk at the time of his death, and published with the half-complete manuscript of &quot;The Visible and the Invisible&quot;, several make it evident that Merleau-Ponty himself recognized a deep affinity between his notion of a primordial &quot;flesh&quot; and a radically transformed understanding of &quot;nature&quot;. Hence, in November 1960 he writes: &quot;Do a psychoanalysis of Nature: it is the flesh, the mother.&quot; And in the last published working note, written in March 1961, he writes: &quot;Nature as the other side of humanity (as flesh, nowise as &#x27;matter&#x27;).&quot; This resonates with the conception of space, place, dwelling, and embodiment (in the flesh and physical, vs. virtual and cybernetic), especially as they are addressed against the background of the unfolding of the essence of modern technology. Such analytics figure in a Heideggerian take on &quot;econtology&quot; as an extension of Heidegger&#x27;s consideration of the question of being (&quot;Seinsfrage&quot;) by way of the fourfold (&quot;Das Geviert&quot;) of earth-sky-mortals-divinities (&quot;Erde und Himmel, Sterblichen und Göttlichen&quot;). In this strand of &quot;ecophenomenology&quot;, ecology is co-entangled with ontology, whereby the worldly existential analytics are grounded in earthiness, and environmentalism is orientated by ontological thinking.

<text>A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the model organism will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.

Research using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. The results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s work with the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan&#x27;s discoveries &quot;helped transform biology into an experimental science&quot;. Research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as the production of the diphtheria antitoxin and the 1922 discovery of insulin and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. Modern general anaesthetics such as halothane were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations. Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. 

In researching human disease, model organisms allow for better understanding the disease process without the added risk of harming an actual human. The species of the model organism is usually chosen so that it reacts to disease or its treatment in a way that resembles human physiology, even though care must be taken when generalizing from one organism to another. However, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful &quot;in vitro&quot; model system available.

Model organisms are drawn from all three domains of life, as well as viruses. One of the first model systems for molecular biology was the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (&quot;E. coli&quot;), a common constituent of the human digestive system. The mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;) has been used extensively as a model organism and is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries. Other examples include baker&#x27;s yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;), the T4 phage virus, the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the flowering plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, and guinea pigs (&quot;Cavia porcellus&quot;). Several of the bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) that infect &quot;E. coli&quot; also have been very useful for the study of gene structure and gene regulation (e.g. phages Lambda and T4). Disease models are divided into three categories: homologous animals have the same causes, symptoms and treatment options as would humans who have the same disease, isomorphic animals share the same symptoms and treatments, and predictive models are similar to a particular human disease in only a couple of aspects, but are useful in isolating and making predictions about mechanisms of a set of disease features.

==History==
The use of animals in research dates back to ancient Greece, with Aristotle (384–322 BCE) and Erasistratus (304–258 BCE) among the first to perform experiments on living animals. Discoveries in the 18th and 19th centuries included Antoine Lavoisier&#x27;s use of a guinea pig in a calorimeter to prove that respiration was a form of combustion, and Louis Pasteur&#x27;s demonstration of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s using anthrax in sheep.

Research using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. For example, the results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s work with the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. &quot;Drosophila&quot; became one of the first, and for some time the most widely used, model organisms, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan&#x27;s discoveries &quot;helped transform biology into an experimental science&quot;. &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; remains one of the most widely used eukaryotic model organisms. During the same time period, studies on mouse genetics in the laboratory of William Ernest Castle in collaboration with Abbie Lathrop led to generation of the DBA (&quot;dilute, brown and non-agouti&quot;) inbred mouse strain and the systematic generation of other inbred strains. The mouse has since been used extensively as a model organism and is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries.

In the late 19th century, Emil von Behring isolated the diphtheria toxin and demonstrated its effects in guinea pigs. He went on to develop an antitoxin against diphtheria in animals and then in humans, which resulted in the modern methods of immunization and largely ended diphtheria as a threatening disease. The diphtheria antitoxin is famously commemorated in the Iditarod race, which is modeled after the delivery of antitoxin in the 1925 serum run to Nome. The success of animal studies in producing the diphtheria antitoxin has also been attributed as a cause for the decline of the early 20th-century opposition to animal research in the United States.

Subsequent research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as Frederick Banting&#x27;s research in dogs, which determined that the isolates of pancreatic secretion could be used to treat dogs with diabetes. This led to the 1922 discovery of insulin (with John Macleod) and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. John Cade&#x27;s research in guinea pigs discovered the anticonvulsant properties of lithium salts, which revolutionized the treatment of bipolar disorder, replacing the previous treatments of lobotomy or electroconvulsive therapy. Modern general anaesthetics, such as halothane and related compounds, were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations.

In the 1940s, Jonas Salk used rhesus monkey studies to isolate the most virulent forms of the polio virus, which led to his creation of a polio vaccine. The vaccine, which was made publicly available in 1955, reduced the incidence of polio 15-fold in the United States over the following five years. Albert Sabin improved the vaccine by passing the polio virus through animal hosts, including monkeys; the Sabin vaccine was produced for mass consumption in 1963, and had virtually eradicated polio in the United States by 1965. It has been estimated that developing and producing the vaccines required the use of 100,000 rhesus monkeys, with 65 doses of vaccine produced from each monkey. Sabin wrote in 1992, &quot;Without the use of animals and human beings, it would have been impossible to acquire the important knowledge needed to prevent much suffering and premature death not only among humans, but also among animals.&quot;

Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful &quot;in vitro&quot; model system available.

==Selection==
Models are those organisms with a wealth of biological data that make them attractive to study as examples for other species and/or natural phenomena that are more difficult to study directly. Continual research on these organisms focuses on a wide variety of experimental techniques and goals from many different levels of biology—from ecology, behavior and biomechanics, down to the tiny functional scale of individual tissues, organelles and proteins. Inquiries about the DNA of organisms are classed as genetic models (with short generation times, such as the fruitfly and nematode worm), experimental models, and genomic parsimony models, investigating pivotal position in the evolutionary tree. Historically, model organisms include a handful of species with extensive genomic research data, such as the NIH model organisms.

Often, model organisms are chosen on the basis that they are amenable to experimental manipulation. This usually will include characteristics such as short life-cycle, techniques for genetic manipulation (inbred strains, stem cell lines, and methods of transformation) and non-specialist living requirements. Sometimes, the genome arrangement facilitates the sequencing of the model organism&#x27;s genome, for example, by being very compact or having a low proportion of junk DNA (e.g. yeast, arabidopsis, or pufferfish).

When researchers look for an organism to use in their studies, they look for several traits. Among these are size, generation time, accessibility, manipulation, genetics, conservation of mechanisms, and potential economic benefit. As comparative molecular biology has become more common, some researchers have sought model organisms from a wider assortment of lineages on the tree of life.

===Phylogeny and genetic relatedness===
The primary reason for the use of model organisms in research is the evolutionary principle that all organisms share some degree of relatedness and genetic similarity due to common ancestry. The study of taxonomic human relatives, then, can provide a great deal of information about mechanism and disease within the human body that can be useful in medicine.

Various phylogenetic trees for vertebrates have been constructed using comparative proteomics, genetics, genomics as well as the geochemical and fossil record. These estimations tell us that humans and chimpanzees last shared a common ancestor about 6 million years ago (mya). As our closest relatives, chimpanzees have a lot of potential to tell us about mechanisms of disease (and what genes may be responsible for human intelligence). However, chimpanzees are rarely used in research and are protected from highly invasive procedures. Rodents are the most common animal models. Phylogenetic trees estimate that humans and rodents last shared a common ancestor ~80-100mya. Despite this distant split, humans and rodents have far more similarities than they do differences. This is due to the relative stability of large portions of the genome, making the use of vertebrate animals particularly productive.

Genomic data is used to make close comparisons between species and determine relatedness. Humans share about 99% of their genome with chimpanzees (98.7% with bonobos) and over 90% with the mouse. With so much of the genome conserved across species, it is relatively impressive that the differences between humans and mice can be accounted for in approximately six thousand genes (of ~30,000 total). Scientists have been able to take advantage of these similarities in generating experimental and predictive models of human disease.

== Use ==
There are many model organisms. One of the first model systems for molecular biology was the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, a common constituent of the human digestive system. Several of the bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) that infect &quot;E. coli&quot; also have been very useful for the study of gene structure and gene regulation (e.g. phages Lambda and T4). However, it is debated whether bacteriophages should be classified as organisms, because they lack metabolism and depend on functions of the host cells for propagation.

In eukaryotes, several yeasts, particularly &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (&quot;baker&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;budding&quot; yeast), have been widely used in genetics and cell biology, largely because they are quick and easy to grow. The cell cycle in a simple yeast is very similar to the cell cycle in humans and is regulated by homologous proteins. The fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; is studied, again, because it is easy to grow for an animal, has various visible congenital traits and has a polytene (giant) chromosome in its salivary glands that can be examined under a light microscope. The roundworm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; is studied because it has very defined development patterns involving fixed numbers of cells, and it can be rapidly assayed for abnormalities.

==Disease models==

Animal models serving in research may have an existing, inbred or induced disease or injury that is similar to a human condition. These test conditions are often termed as animal models of disease. The use of animal models allows researchers to investigate disease states in ways which would be inaccessible in a human patient, performing procedures on the non-human animal that imply a level of harm that would not be considered ethical to inflict on a human.

The best models of disease are similar in etiology (mechanism of cause) and phenotype (signs and symptoms) to the human equivalent. However complex human diseases can often be better understood in a simplified system in which individual parts of the disease process are isolated and examined. For instance, behavioral analogues of anxiety or pain in laboratory animals can be used to screen and test new drugs for the treatment of these conditions in humans. A 2000 study found that animal models concorded (coincided on true positives and false negatives) with human toxicity in 71% of cases, with 63% for nonrodents alone and 43% for rodents alone.

In 1987, Davidson et al. suggested that selection of an animal model for research be based on nine considerations. These include 

Animal models can be classified as homologous, isomorphic or predictive. Animal models can also be more broadly classified into four categories: 1) experimental, 2) spontaneous, 3) negative, 4) orphan.

Experimental models are most common. These refer to models of disease that resemble human conditions in phenotype or response to treatment but are induced artificially in the laboratory. Some examples include:
* The use of metrazol (pentylenetetrazol) as an animal model of epilepsy
* Induction of mechanical brain injury as an animal model of post-traumatic epilepsy
* Injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine to dopaminergic parts of the basal ganglia as an animal model of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
* Immunisation with an auto-antigen to induce an immune response to model autoimmune diseases such as Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
* Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery as an animal model of ischemic stroke
* Injection of blood in the basal ganglia of mice as a model for hemorrhagic stroke
* Sepsis and septic shock induction by impairing the integrity of barrier tissues, administering live pathogens or toxins
* Infecting animals with pathogens to reproduce human infectious diseases
* Injecting animals with agonists or antagonists of various neurotransmitters to reproduce human mental disorders
* Using ionizing radiation to cause tumors
* Using gene transfer to cause tumors
* Implanting animals with tumors to test and develop treatments using ionizing radiation
* Genetically selected (such as in diabetic mice also known as NOD mice)
* Various animal models for of drugs for the treatment of glaucoma
* The use of the ovariectomized rat in osteoporosis research
* Use of &quot;Plasmodium yoelii&quot; as a model of human malaria

Spontaneous models refer to diseases that are analogous to human conditions that occur naturally in the animal being studied. These models are rare, but informative. Negative models essentially refer to control animals, which are useful for validating an experimental result. Orphan models refer to diseases for which there is no human analog and occur exclusively in the species studied.

The increase in knowledge of the genomes of non-human primates and other mammals that are genetically close to humans is allowing the production of genetically engineered animal tissues, organs and even animal species which express human diseases, providing a more robust model of human diseases in an animal model.

Animal models observed in the sciences of psychology and sociology are often termed animal models of behavior. It is difficult to build an animal model that perfectly reproduces the symptoms of depression in patients. Depression, as other mental disorders, consists of endophenotypes that can be reproduced independently and evaluated in animals. An ideal animal model offers an opportunity to understand molecular, genetic and epigenetic factors that may lead to depression. By using animal models, the underlying molecular alterations and the causal relationship between genetic or environmental alterations and depression can be examined, which would afford a better insight into pathology of depression. In addition, animal models of depression are indispensable for identifying novel therapies for depression.

==Important model organisms==
Model organisms are drawn from all three domains of life, as well as viruses. The most widely studied prokaryotic model organism is &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (&quot;E. coli&quot;), which has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. It is a common, gram-negative gut bacterium which can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting. It is the most widely used organism in molecular genetics, and is an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA.

Simple model eukaryotes include baker&#x27;s yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) and fission yeast (&quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;), both of which share many characters with higher cells, including those of humans. For instance, many cell division genes that are critical for the development of cancer have been discovered in yeast. &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot;, a unicellular green alga with well-studied genetics, is used to study photosynthesis and motility. &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; has many known and mapped mutants and expressed sequence tags, and there are advanced methods for genetic transformation and selection of genes. &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; is used in molecular biology and genetics, and is studied as an example of cell communication, differentiation, and programmed cell death.
Among invertebrates, the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; is famous as the subject of genetics experiments by Thomas Hunt Morgan and others. They are easily raised in the lab, with rapid generations, high fecundity, few chromosomes, and easily induced observable mutations. The nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; is used for understanding the genetic control of development and physiology. It was first proposed as a model for neuronal development by Sydney Brenner in 1963, and has been extensively used in many different contexts since then. &quot;C. elegans&quot; was the first multicellular organism whose genome was completely sequenced, and as of 2012, the only organism to have its connectome (neuronal &quot;wiring diagram&quot;) completed.

&quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; is currently the most popular model plant. Its small stature and short generation time facilitates rapid genetic studies, and many phenotypic and biochemical mutants have been mapped. &quot;A. thaliana&quot; was the first plant to have its genome sequenced.

Among vertebrates, guinea pigs (&quot;Cavia porcellus&quot;) were used by Robert Koch and other early bacteriologists as a host for bacterial infections, becoming a byword for &quot;laboratory animal&quot;, but are less commonly used today. The classic model vertebrate is currently the mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;). Many inbred strains exist, as well as lines selected for particular traits, often of medical interest, e.g. body size, obesity, muscularity, and voluntary wheel-running behavior.
The rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) is particularly useful as a toxicology model, and as a neurological model and source of primary cell cultures, owing to the larger size of organs and suborganellar structures relative to the mouse, while eggs and embryos from &quot;Xenopus tropicalis&quot; and &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; (African clawed frog) are used in developmental biology, cell biology, toxicology, and neuroscience. Likewise, the zebrafish (&quot;Danio rerio&quot;) has a nearly transparent body during early development, which provides unique visual access to the animal&#x27;s internal anatomy during this time period. Zebrafish are used to study development, toxicology and toxicopathology, specific gene function and roles of signaling pathways.

Other important model organisms and some of their uses include: T4 phage (viral infection), &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot; (intracellular processes), maize (transposons), &quot;hydras&quot; (regeneration and morphogenesis), cats (neurophysiology), chickens (development), dogs (respiratory and cardiovascular systems), &quot;Nothobranchius furzeri&quot; (aging), non-human primates such as the rhesus macaque and chimpanzee (hepatitis, HIV, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, cognition, and vaccines), and ferrets (SARS-CoV-2)

===Selected model organisms===
The organisms below have become model organisms because they facilitate the study of certain characters or because of their genetic accessibility. For example, &quot;E. coli&quot; was one of the first organisms for which genetic techniques such as transformation or genetic manipulation has been developed.

The genomes of all model species have been sequenced, including their mitochondrial/chloroplast genomes. Model organism databases exist to provide researchers with a portal from which to download sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) or to access functional information on specific genes, for example the sub-cellular localization of the gene product or its physiological role.

==Limitations==
Many animal models serving as test subjects in biomedical research, such as rats and mice, may be selectively sedentary, obese and glucose intolerant. This may confound their use to model human metabolic processes and diseases as these can be affected by dietary energy intake and exercise. Similarly, there are differences between the immune systems of model organisms and humans that lead to significantly altered responses to stimuli, although the underlying principles of genome function may be the same. The impoverished environments inside standard laboratory cages deny research animals of the mental and physical challenges are necessary for healthy emotional development. Without day-to-day variety, risks and rewards, and complex environments, some have argued that animal models are irrelevant models of human experience.

Mice differ from humans in several immune properties: mice are more resistant to some toxins than humans; have a lower total neutrophil fraction in the blood, a lower neutrophil enzymatic capacity, lower activity of the complement system, and a different set of pentraxins involved in the inflammatory process; and lack genes for important components of the immune system, such as IL-8, IL-37, TLR10, ICAM-3, etc. Laboratory mice reared in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions usually have a rather immature immune system with a deficit of memory T cells. These mice may have limited diversity of the microbiota, which directly affects the immune system and the development of pathological conditions. Moreover, persistent virus infections (for example, herpesviruses) are activated in humans, but not in SPF mice, with septic complications and may change the resistance to bacterial coinfections. “Dirty” mice are possibly better suitable for mimicking human pathologies. In addition, inbred mouse strains are used in the overwhelming majority of studies, while the human population is heterogeneous, pointing to the importance of studies in interstrain hybrid, outbred, and nonlinear mice.

=== Unintended bias ===
Some studies suggests that inadequate published data in animal testing may result in irreproducible research, with missing details about how experiments are done omitted from published papers or differences in testing that may introduce bias. Examples of hidden bias include a 2014 study from McGill University in Montreal, Canada which suggests that mice handled by men rather than women showed higher stress levels. Another study in 2016 suggested that gut microbiomes in mice may have an impact upon scientific research.

===Alternatives===
Ethical concerns, as well as the cost, maintenance and relative inefficiency of animal research has encouraged development of alternative methods for the study of disease. Cell culture, or &quot;in vitro&quot; studies, provide an alternative that preserves the physiology of the living cell, but does not require the sacrifice of an animal for mechanistic studies. Human, inducible pluripotent stem cells can also elucidate new mechanisms for understanding cancer and cell regeneration. Imaging studies (such as MRI or PET scans) enable non-invasive study of human subjects. Recent advances in genetics and genomics can identify disease-associated genes, which can be targeted for therapies.

Many biomedical researchers argue that there is no substitute for a living organism when studying complex interactions in disease pathology or treatments.

==Ethics==
Debate about the ethical use of animals in research dates at least as far back as 1822 when the British Parliament under pressure from British and Indian intellectuals enacted the first law for animal protection preventing cruelty to cattle. This was followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849, which criminalized ill-treating, over-driving, and torturing animals. In 1876, under pressure from the National Anti-Vivisection Society, the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849 was amended to include regulations governing the use of animals in research. This new act stipulated that 1) experiments must be proven absolutely necessary for instruction, or to save or prolong human life; 2) animals must be properly anesthetized; and 3) animals must be killed as soon as the experiment is over. Today, these three principles are central to the laws and guidelines governing the use of animals and research. In the U.S., the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 (see also Laboratory Animal Welfare Act) set standards for animal use and care in research. This law is enforced by APHIS&#x27;s Animal Care program.

In academic settings in which NIH funding is used for animal research, institutions are governed by the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). At each site, OLAW guidelines and standards are upheld by a local review board called the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All laboratory experiments involving living animals are reviewed and approved by this committee. In addition to proving the potential for benefit to human health, minimization of pain and distress, and timely and humane euthanasia, experimenters must justify their protocols based on the principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement.

&quot;Replacement&quot; refers to efforts to engage alternatives to animal use. This includes the use of computer models, non-living tissues and cells, and replacement of “higher-order” animals (primates and mammals) with “lower” order animals (e.g. cold-blooded animals, invertebrates) wherever possible.

&quot;Reduction&quot; refers to efforts to minimize number of animals used during the course of an experiment, as well as prevention of unnecessary replication of previous experiments. To satisfy this requirement, mathematical calculations of statistical power are employed to determine the minimum number of animals that can be used to get a statistically significant experimental result.

&quot;Refinement&quot; refers to efforts to make experimental design as painless and efficient as possible in order to minimize the suffering of each animal subject.

<doc id="19376" wikidata="Q7081" url="?curid=19376" title="Materialism">
<text>Materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental states and consciousness, are results of material interactions of material things. According to philosophical materialism, mind and consciousness are caused by physical processes, such as the neurochemistry of the human brain and nervous system, without which they cannot exist. Materialism directly contrasts with monistic idealism, according to which consciousness is the fundamental substance of nature.

Materialism is closely related to physicalism—the view that all that exists is ultimately physical. Philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the theories of the physical sciences to incorporate forms of physicality in addition to ordinary matter (e.g. spacetime, physical energies and forces, and exotic matter). Thus, some prefer the term &quot;physicalism&quot; to &quot;materialism&quot;, while others use the terms as if they were synonymous.

Discoveries of neural correlates between consciousness and the brain are taken as empirical support for materialism, but some philosophers of mind find that association fallacious or consider it compatible with non-materialist ideas. Alternative philosophies opposed or alternative to materialism or physicalism include idealism, pluralism, dualism, panpsychism, and other forms of monism. Epicureanism is a philosophy of materialism from classical antiquity that was a major forerunner of modern science. Though ostensibly a deist, Epicurus affirmed the literal existence of the Greek gods in either some type of celestial &quot;heaven&quot; cognate from which they ruled the universe (if not on a literal Mount Olympus), and his philosophy promulgated atomism, while Platonism taught roughly the opposite, despite Plato&#x27;s teaching of Zeus as God.

==Overview==
Materialism belongs to the class of monist ontology, and is thus different from ontological theories based on dualism or pluralism. For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism is in contrast to idealism, neutral monism, and spiritualism. It can also contrast with phenomenalism, vitalism, and dual-aspect monism. Its materiality can, in some ways, be linked to the concept of determinism, as espoused by Enlightenment thinkers.

Despite the large number of philosophical schools and their nuances, all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, defined in contrast to each other: &quot;idealism&quot; and &quot;materialism&quot;. The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality: the primary difference between them is how they answer two fundamental questions—what reality consists of, and how it originated. To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (&quot;ideas&quot;) are primary, and matter secondary. To materialists, matter is primary, and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary—the product of matter acting upon matter.

The materialist view is perhaps best understood in its opposition to the doctrines of immaterial substance applied to the mind historically by René Descartes; by itself, materialism says nothing about how material substance should be characterized. In practice, it is frequently assimilated to one variety of physicalism or another.

Modern philosophical materialists extend the definition of other scientifically observable entities such as energy, forces, and the spacetime continuum; some philosophers, such as Mary Midgley, suggest that the concept of &quot;matter&quot; is elusive and poorly defined.

During the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels extended the concept of materialism to elaborate a &quot;materialist conception of history&quot; centered on the roughly empirical world of human activity (practice, including labor) and the institutions created, reproduced or destroyed by that activity. They also developed dialectical materialism, by taking Hegelian dialectics, stripping them of their idealist aspects, and fusing them with materialism (see Modern philosophy).

=== Non-reductive materialism ===

Materialism is often associated with reductionism, according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one level of description, if they are genuine, must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description—typically, at a more reduced level.

&quot;Non-reductive materialism&quot; explicitly rejects this notion, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents. Jerry Fodor held this view, according to which empirical laws and explanations in &quot;special sciences&quot; like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics.

==History==
===Early history===

====Before Common Era====
Materialism developed, possibly independently, in several geographically separated regions of Eurasia during what Karl Jaspers termed the Axial Age ( 800–200 BC).

In ancient Indian philosophy, materialism developed around 600 BC with the works of Ajita Kesakambali, Payasi, Kanada and the proponents of the Cārvāka school of philosophy. Kanada became one of the early proponents of atomism. The Nyaya–Vaisesika school (c. 600–100 BC) developed one of the earliest forms of atomism (although their proofs of God and their positing that consciousness was not material precludes labelling them as materialists). Buddhist atomism and the Jaina school continued the atomic tradition.

Ancient Greek atomists like Leucippus, Democritus and Epicurus prefigure later materialists. The Latin poem &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot; by Lucretius (99 – c. 55 BC) reflects the mechanistic philosophy of Democritus and Epicurus. According to this view, all that exists is matter and void, and all phenomena result from different motions and conglomerations of base material particles called &quot;atoms&quot; (literally &quot;indivisibles&quot;). &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot; provides mechanistic explanations for phenomena such as erosion, evaporation, wind, and sound. Famous principles like &quot;nothing can touch body but body&quot; first appeared in Lucretius&#x27;s work. Democritus and Epicurus did not espouse a monist ontology, instead espousing the ontological separation of matter and space (i.e. that space is &quot;another kind&quot; of being).

====Early Common Era====
Wang Chong (27 – c. 100 AD) was a Chinese thinker of the early Common Era said to be a materialist. Later Indian materialist Jayaraashi Bhatta (6th century) in his work &quot;Tattvopaplavasimha&quot; (&quot;The Upsetting of All Principles&quot;) refuted the Nyāya Sūtra epistemology. The materialistic Cārvāka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1400; when Madhavacharya compiled &quot;Sarva-darśana-samgraha&quot; (&quot;A Digest of All Philosophies&quot;) in the 14th century, he had no Cārvāka (or Lokāyata) text to quote from or refer to.

In early 12th-century al-Andalus, Arabian philosopher Ibn Tufail ( Abubacer) discussed materialism in his philosophical novel, &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; (&quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;), while vaguely foreshadowing historical materialism.

====Modern philosophy====
In France, Pierre Gassendi (1592–1665) represented the materialist tradition in opposition to the attempts of René Descartes (1596–1650) to provide the natural sciences with dualist foundations. There followed the materialist and atheist &quot;abbé&quot; Jean Meslier (1664–1729), along with the French materialists: Julien Offray de La Mettrie (1709–1751), Denis Diderot (1713–1784), Étienne Bonnot de Condillac (1714–1780), Claude Adrien Helvétius (1715–1771), German-French Baron d&#x27;Holbach (1723–1789), and other French Enlightenment thinkers.

In England, materialism was developed in the philosophies of Francis Bacon (1561–1626), Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), and John Locke (1632–1704). Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) became one of the most important materialist philosophers in the 18th century. John &quot;Walking&quot; Stewart (1747–1822) believed matter has a moral dimension, which had a major impact on the philosophical poetry of William Wordsworth (1770–1850).

In late modern philosophy, German atheist anthropologist Ludwig Feuerbach signaled a new turn in materialism in his 1841 book &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot;, which presented a humanist account of religion as the outward projection of man&#x27;s inward nature. Feuerbach introduced anthropological materialism, a version of materialism that views materialist anthropology as the universal science.

Feuerbach&#x27;s variety of materialism heavily influenced Karl Marx, who in the late 19th century elaborated the concept of historical materialism—the basis for what Marx and Friedrich Engels outlined as &quot;scientific socialism&quot;:

Through his &quot;Dialectics of Nature&quot; (1883), Engels later developed a &quot;materialist dialectic&quot; philosophy of nature, a worldview that Georgi Plekhanov, the father of Russian Marxism, called &quot;dialectical materialism&quot;. In early 20th-century Russian philosophy, Vladimir Lenin further developed dialectical materialism in his 1909 book &quot;Materialism and Empirio-criticism&quot;, which connects his opponents&#x27; political conceptions to their anti-materialist philosophies.

A more naturalist-oriented materialist school of thought that developed in the mid-19th century was German materialism, which included Ludwig Büchner (1824–1899), the Dutch-born Jacob Moleschott (1822–1893), and Carl Vogt (1817–1895), even though they had different views on core issues such as the evolution and the origins of life.

===Contemporary history===
====Analytic philosophy====

Contemporary analytic philosophers (e.g. Daniel Dennett, Willard Van Orman Quine, Donald Davidson, and Jerry Fodor) operate within a broadly physicalist or scientific materialist framework, producing rival accounts of how best to accommodate the mind, including functionalism, anomalous monism, and identity theory.

Scientific materialism is often synonymous with, and has typically been described as, a reductive materialism. In the early 21st century, Paul and Patricia Churchland advocated a radically contrasting position (at least in regard to certain hypotheses): eliminative materialism. Eliminative materialism holds that some mental phenomena simply do not exist at all, and that talk of such phenomena reflects a spurious &quot;folk psychology&quot; and introspection illusion. A materialist of this variety might believe that a concept like &quot;belief&quot; has no basis in fact (e.g. the way folk science speaks of demon-caused illnesses).

With reductive materialism at one end of a continuum (our theories will &quot;reduce&quot; to facts) and eliminative materialism at the other (certain theories will need to be &quot;eliminated&quot; in light of new facts), revisionary materialism is somewhere in the middle.

====Continental philosophy====

Contemporary continental philosopher Gilles Deleuze has attempted to rework and strengthen classical materialist ideas. Contemporary theorists such as Manuel DeLanda, working with this reinvigorated materialism, have come to be classified as &quot;new materialists&quot;. New materialism has become its own subfield, with courses on it at major universities, as well as numerous conferences, edited collections and monographs devoted to it.

Jane Bennett&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;Vibrant Matter&quot; has been particularly instrumental in bringing theories of monist ontology and vitalism back into a critical theoretical fold dominated by poststructuralist theories of language and discourse. Scholars such as Mel Y. Chen and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson have critiqued this body of new materialist literature for neglecting to consider the materiality of race and gender in particular.

Métis scholar Zoe Todd, as well as Mohawk (Bear Clan, Six Nations) and Anishinaabe scholar Vanessa Watts, query the colonial orientation of the race for a &quot;new&quot; materialism. Watts in particular describes the tendency to regard matter as a subject of feminist or philosophical care as a tendency too invested in the reanimation of a Eurocentric tradition of inquiry at the expense of an Indigenous ethic of responsibility. Other scholars, such as Helene Vosters, echo their concerns and have questioned whether there is anything particularly &quot;new&quot; about &quot;new materialism&quot;, as Indigenous and other animist ontologies have attested to what might be called the &quot;vibrancy of matter&quot; for centuries. Others, such as Thomas Nail, have critiqued &quot;vitalist&quot; versions of new materialism for depoliticizing &quot;flat ontology&quot; and being ahistorical.

Quentin Meillassoux proposed &quot;speculative materialism&quot;, a post-Kantian return to David Hume also based on materialist ideas.

==Defining &quot;matter&quot;==
The nature and definition of &quot;matter&quot;—like other key concepts in science and philosophy—have occasioned much debate:

* Is there a single kind of matter (&quot;hyle&quot;) that everything is made of, or are there multiple kinds?
* Is matter a continuous substance capable of expressing multiple forms (&quot;hylomorphism&quot;) or a number of discrete, unchanging constituents (atomism)?
* Does matter have intrinsic properties (&quot;substance theory&quot;) or lack them (&quot;prima materia&quot;)?

One challenge to the conventional concept of matter as tangible &quot;stuff&quot; came with the rise of field physics in the 19th century. Relativity shows that matter and energy (including the spatially distributed energy of fields) are interchangeable. This enables the ontological view that energy is &quot;prima materia&quot; and matter is one of its forms. In contrast, the Standard Model of particle physics uses quantum field theory to describe all interactions. On this view it could be said that fields are &quot;prima materia&quot; and the energy is a property of the field.

According to the dominant cosmological model, the Lambda-CDM model, less than 5% of the universe&#x27;s energy density is made up of the &quot;matter&quot; the Standard Model describes, and most of the universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy, with little agreement among scientists about what these are made of.

With the advent of quantum physics, some scientists believed the concept of matter had merely changed, while others believed the conventional position could no longer be maintained. Werner Heisenberg said: &quot;The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct &#x27;actuality&#x27; of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible...atoms are not things.&quot;

The concept of matter has changed in response to new scientific discoveries. Thus materialism has no definite content independent of the particular theory of matter on which it is based. According to Noam Chomsky, any property can be considered material, if one defines matter such that it has that property.

The philosophical materialist Gustavo Bueno uses a more precise term than &quot;matter&quot;, the &quot;stroma.&quot;

In &quot;Materialism and Empirio-Criticism&quot;, Lenin argues that the truth of dialectical materialism is unrelated to any particular understanding of matter. To him, such changes actually confirm the dialectical form of materialism.
==Physicalism==

George Stack distinguishes between materialism and physicalism: 

But not all conceptions of physicalism are tied to verificationist theories of meaning or direct realist accounts of perception. Rather, physicalists believe that no &quot;element of reality&quot; is missing from the mathematical formalism of our best description of the world. &quot;Materialist&quot; physicalists also believe that the formalism describes fields of insentience. In other words, the intrinsic nature of the physical is non-experiential.

==Religious and spiritual views==
===Christianity===

===Hinduism and Transcendental Club===
Most Hindus and transcendentalists regard all matter as an illusion, or &quot;maya&quot;, blinding humans from the truth. Transcendental experiences like the perception of Brahman are considered to destroy the illusion.

==Criticism and alternatives==

===From contemporary physicists===
Rudolf Peierls, a physicist who played a major role in the Manhattan Project, rejected materialism: &quot;The premise that you can describe in terms of physics the whole function of a human being... including knowledge and consciousness, is untenable. There is still something missing.&quot;

Erwin Schrödinger said, &quot;Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.&quot;

Werner Heisenberg wrote: &quot;The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct &#x27;actuality&#x27; of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible... Atoms are not things.&quot;

====Quantum mechanics====
Some 20th-century physicists (e.g., Eugene Wigner and Henry Stapp), and some modern physicists and science writers (e.g., Stephen Barr, Paul Davies, and John Gribbin) have argued that materialism is flawed due to certain recent findings in physics, such as quantum mechanics and chaos theory. According to Gribbin and Davies (1991):

====Digital physics====
The objections of Davies and Gribbin are shared by proponents of digital physics, who view information rather than matter as fundamental. The physicist and proponent of digital physics John Archibald Wheeler wrote, &quot;all matter and all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.&quot; Some founders of quantum theory, such as Max Planck, shared their objections. He wrote:

James Jeans concurred with Planck, saying, &quot;The Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter.&quot;

===Philosophical objections===
In the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Immanuel Kant argued against materialism in defending his transcendental idealism (as well as offering arguments against subjective idealism and mind–body dualism). But Kant argues that change and time require an enduring substrate.

Postmodern/poststructuralist thinkers also express skepticism about any all-encompassing metaphysical scheme. Philosopher Mary Midgley argues that materialism is a self-refuting idea, at least in its eliminative materialist form.

====Varieties of idealism====
Arguments for idealism, such as those of Hegel and Berkeley, often take the form of an argument against materialism; indeed, Berkeley&#x27;s idealism was called &quot;immaterialism&quot;. Now, matter can be argued to be redundant, as in bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can, in turn, be reduced to subjective percepts. Berkeley gives an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, matter&#x27;s existence can only be inferred from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.

If matter and energy are seen as necessary to explain the physical world, but incapable of explaining mind, dualism results. Emergence, holism and process philosophy seek to ameliorate the perceived shortcomings of traditional (especially mechanistic) materialism without abandoning materialism entirely.

===Materialism as methodology===
Some critics object to materialism as part of an overly skeptical, narrow or reductivist approach to theorizing, rather than to the ontological claim that matter is the only substance. Particle physicist and Anglican theologian John Polkinghorne objects to what he calls &quot;promissory materialism&quot;—claims that materialistic science will eventually succeed in explaining phenomena it has not so far been able to explain. Polkinghorne prefers &quot;dual-aspect monism&quot; to materialism.

Some scientific materialists have been criticized for failing to provide clear definitions of matter, leaving the term &quot;materialism&quot; without any definite meaning. Noam Chomsky states that since the concept of matter may be affected by new scientific discoveries, as has happened in the past, scientific materialists are being dogmatic in assuming the opposite.

<text>Microelectronics is a subfield of electronics. As the name suggests, microelectronics relates to the study and manufacture (or microfabrication) of very small electronic designs and components. Usually, but not always, this means micrometre-scale or smaller. These devices are typically made from semiconductor materials. Many components of a normal electronic design are available in a microelectronic equivalent. These include transistors, capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes and (naturally) insulators and conductors can all be found in microelectronic devices. Unique wiring techniques such as wire bonding are also often used in microelectronics because of the unusually small size of the components, leads and pads. This technique requires specialized equipment and is expensive.

Digital integrated circuits (ICs) consist of billions of transistors, resistors, diodes, and capacitors. Analog circuits commonly contain resistors and capacitors as well. Inductors are used in some high frequency analog circuits, but tend to occupy larger chip area due to their lower reactance at low frequencies. Gyrators can replace them in many applications.

As techniques have improved, the scale of microelectronic components has continued to decrease. At smaller scales, the relative impact of intrinsic circuit properties such as interconnections may become more significant. These are called parasitic effects, and the goal of the microelectronics design engineer is to find ways to compensate for or to minimize these effects, while delivering smaller, faster, and cheaper devices.

Today, microelectronics design is largely aided by electronic design automation (EDA) software.

<text>The mind is that which thinks, feels, perceives, imagines, remembers, and wills. It covers the totality of mental phenomena, including both conscious processes, through which an individual is aware of external and internal circumstances, and unconscious processes, which can influence an individual without intention or awareness. The mind plays a central role in most aspects of human life but its exact nature is disputed. Some characterizations focus on internal aspects, saying that the mind transforms information and is not directly accessible to outside observers. Others stress its relation to outward conduct, understanding mental phenomena as dispositions to engage in observable behavior.

The mind–body problem is the challenge of explaining the relation between matter and mind. Traditionally, mind and matter were often thought of as distinct substances that could exist independently from one another. The dominant philosophical position since the 20th century has been physicalism, which says that everything is material, meaning that minds are certain aspects or features of some material objects. The evolutionary history of the mind is tied to the development of nervous systems, which led to the formation of brains. As brains became more complex, the number and capacity of mental functions increased with particular brain areas dedicated to specific mental functions. Individual human minds also develop as they learn from experience and pass through psychological stages in the process of aging. Some people are affected by mental disorders, in which certain mental capacities do not function as they should.

It is widely accepted that non-human animals have some form of mind, but it is controversial to which animals this applies. The topic of artificial minds poses similar challenges and theorists discuss the possibility and consequences of creating them using computers.

The main fields of inquiry studying the mind include psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind. They tend to focus on different aspects of the mind and employ different methods of investigation, ranging from empirical observation and neuroimaging to conceptual analysis and thought experiments. The mind is relevant to many other fields, including epistemology, anthropology, religion, and education.

== Definition ==
The mind is the totality of psychological phenomena and capacities, encompassing both conscious and unconscious states. The term &quot;mind&quot; is sometimes used in a narrow meaning to refer only to cognitive functions associated with perception, reasoning, awareness, and memory. In a broader sense, it also includes processes like feeling, motivation, and behavior. The precise definition of mind is disputed and while it is generally accepted that some non-human animals also have minds, there is no agreement on where exactly the boundary lies. Despite these disputes, there is wide agreement that mind plays a central role in most aspects of human life as the seat of consciousness, emotions, thoughts, and sense of personal identity. Various fields of inquiry study the mind; the main ones include psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind.

The words &quot;psyche&quot; and &quot;mentality&quot; are usually used as synonyms of &quot;mind&quot;. They are often employed in overlapping ways with the terms &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;cognition&quot;, &quot;intellect&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot;, and &quot;brain&quot; but their meanings are not exactly the same. Some religions understand the soul as an independent entity that constitutes the immaterial essence of human beings, is of divine origin, survives bodily death, and is immortal. The word &quot;spirit&quot; has various additional meanings not directly associated with mind, such as a vital principle animating living beings or a supernatural being inhabiting objects or places. Cognition encompasses certain types of mental processes in which knowledge is acquired and information processed. The intellect is one mental capacity responsible for thought, reasoning, and understanding and is closely related to intelligence as the ability to acquire, understand, and apply knowledge. The brain is the physical organ responsible for most or all mental functions.

The modern English word &quot;mind&quot; originates from the Old English word , meaning &quot;memory&quot;. This term gave rise to the Middle English words , , and , resulting in a slow expansion of meaning to cover all mental capacities. The original meaning is preserved in expressions like &quot;call to mind&quot; and &quot;keep in mind&quot;. Cognates include the Old High German , the Gothic , the ancient Greek , the Latin , and the Sanskrit .

== Forms ==
The mind encompasses many phenomena, including perception, memory, thought, imagination, motivation, emotion, attention, learning, and consciousness. Perception is the process of interpreting and organizing sensory information to become acquainted with the environment. This information is acquired through sense organs receptive to various types of physical stimuli, which correspond to different forms of perception, such as vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. The sensory information received serves as raw data that is filtered and processed to actively constitute the experience of the world and the objects within it. This complex process underlying perceptual experience is shaped by many factors, including the individual&#x27;s past experiences, cultural background, beliefs, knowledge, and expectations.

Memory is the mechanism of storing and retrieving information. Episodic memory handles information about specific past events in one&#x27;s life and makes this information available in the present. When a person remembers what they had for dinner yesterday, they employ episodic memory. Semantic memory handles general knowledge about the world that is not tied to any specific episodes. When a person recalls that the capital of Japan is Tokyo, they usually employ semantic memory to access this general information without remembering the specific instance when they learned it. Procedural memory is memory of how to do things, such as riding a bicycle or playing a musical instrument. Another distinction is between short-term memory, which holds information for brief periods, usually with the purpose of completing specific cognitive tasks, and long-term memory, which can store information for extended periods, potentially lasting a lifetime.

Thinking involves the processing of information and the manipulation of concepts and ideas. It is goal-oriented and often happens in response to experiences by aiming at making sense of them, organizing their information, and deciding how to respond. Logical reasoning is a form of thinking that starts from a set of premises and aims to arrive at a conclusion supported by these premises. This is the case when deducing that &quot;Socrates is mortal&quot; from the premises &quot;Socrates is a man&quot; and &quot;all men are mortal&quot;. Problem-solving is a closely related process that consists of several steps, such as identifying a problem, developing a plan to address it, implementing the plan, and assessing whether it worked. Thinking in the form of decision-making involves considering possible courses of action to assess which one is the most beneficial. As a symbolic process, thinking is deeply intertwined with language, and some theorists hold that all thought happens through the medium of language.

Imagination is a creative process of internally generating mental images, ideas, experiences, and related phenomena. Unlike perception, it does not directly depend on the stimulation of sensory organs. Similar to dreaming, these mental constructs are often derived from previous experiences but can include novel combinations and elements. Imagination happens during daydreaming and plays a key role in art and literature. Additionally, it can also be used to come up with novel solutions to real-world problems.

Motivation is an internal state that propels individuals to initiate, continue, or terminate goal-directed behavior. It is responsible for the formation of intentions to perform actions and affects what goals someone pursues, how much effort they invest in the activity, and how long they engage in it. Motivation is affected by emotions, which are temporary experiences of positive or negative feelings like joy or anger. They are directed at and evaluate specific events, persons, or situations. They usually come together with certain physiological and behavioral responses.

Attention is an aspect of other mental processes in which mental resources like awareness are directed towards certain features of experience and away from others. This happens when a driver focuses on the traffic while ignoring billboards on the side of the road. Attention can be controlled voluntarily in the pursuit of specific goals but can also be diverted involuntarily when a strong stimulus captures a person&#x27;s attention. Attention is relevant to learning, which is the ability of the mind to acquire new information and permanently modify its understanding and behavioral patterns. Individuals learn by undergoing experiences, which helps them adapt to the environment.

=== Conscious and unconscious ===
An influential distinction is between conscious and unconscious mental processes. Consciousness is the awareness of external and internal circumstances. It encompasses a wide variety of states, such as perception, thinking, fantasizing, dreaming, and altered states of consciousness. In the case of phenomenal consciousness, the awareness involves a direct and qualitative experience of mental phenomena, like the auditory experience of attending a concert. Access consciousness, by contrast, refers to an awareness of information that is accessible to other mental processes but not necessarily part of current experience. For example, the information stored in a memory may be accessible when drawing conclusions or guiding actions even when the person is not explicitly thinking about it.

Unconscious or nonconscious mental processes operate without the individual&#x27;s awareness but can still influence mental phenomena on the level of thought, feeling, and action. Some theorists distinguish between preconscious, subconscious, and unconscious states depending on their accessibility to conscious awareness. When applied to the overall state of a person rather than specific processes, the term &quot;unconscious&quot; implies that the person lacks any awareness of their environment and themselves, like during a coma. The unconscious mind plays a central role in psychoanalysis as the part of the mind that contains thoughts, memories, and desires not accessible to conscious introspection. According to Sigmund Freud, the psychological mechanism of repression keeps disturbing phenomena, like unacceptable sexual and aggressive impulses, from entering consciousness to protect the individual. Psychoanalytic theory studies symptoms caused by this process and therapeutic methods to avoid them by making the repressed thoughts accessible to conscious awareness.

=== Other distinctions ===
Mental states are often divided into qualitative and propositional states. Qualitative states are experiences of sensory qualities, typically referred to as qualia, like colors, sounds, smells, pains, itches, and hunger. Propositional states involve an attitude towards a content that can be expressed by a declarative sentence. When a person believes that it is raining, they have the propositional attitude of belief towards the content &quot;it is raining&quot;. Different types of propositional states are characterized by different attitudes towards their content. For instance, it is also possible to hope, fear, desire, or doubt that it is raining.

A mental state or process is rational if it is based on good reasons or follows the norms of rationality. For example, a belief is rational if it relies on strong supporting evidence and a decision is rational if it follows careful deliberation of all the relevant factors and outcomes. Mental states are irrational if they fail to adhere to these standards, such as beliefs caused by faulty reasoning, superstition, or cognitive biases, and decisions that give into temptations against one&#x27;s best judgment. Mental states that fall outside the domain of rational evaluation are arational rather than irrational. There is controversy regarding which mental phenomena lie outside this domain; suggested examples include sensory impressions, feelings, desires, and involuntary responses.

Another contrast is between dispositional and occurrent mental states. A dispositional state is a power that is not exercised. If a person believes that cats have whiskers but does not think about this fact, it is a dispositional belief. By activating the belief to consciously think about it or use it in other cognitive processes, it becomes occurrent until it is no longer actively considered or used. The great majority of a person&#x27;s beliefs are dispositional most of the time.

=== Faculties and modules ===
Traditionally, the mind was subdivided into mental faculties understood as capacities to perform certain functions or bring about certain processes. An influential subdivision in the history of philosophy was between the faculties of intellect and will. The intellect encompasses mental phenomena aimed at understanding the world and determining what to believe or what is true; the will is concerned with practical matters and what is good, reflected in phenomena like desire, decision-making, and action. The exact number and nature of the mental faculties are disputed. More fine-grained distinctions divide the intellect into the faculties of understanding and judgment or add sensibility as an additional faculty responsible for sensory impressions.

In contrast to the traditional view, more recent approaches analyze the mind in terms of mental modules rather than faculties. A mental module is an inborn system of the brain that automatically performs a particular function within a specific domain without conscious awareness or effort. In contrast to faculties, the concept of mental modules is normally used to provide a more limited explanation. It is typically restricted to certain low-level cognitive processes without trying to explain how they are integrated into higher-level processes such as conscious reasoning. Many low-level cognitive processes responsible for visual perception have this automatic and unconscious nature. In the case of visual illusions like the Müller-Lyer illusion, the underlying processes continue their operation and the illusion persists even after a person has become aware of the illusion, indicating the mechanical and involuntary nature of the process. Other examples of mental modules concern cognitive processes responsible for language processing and facial recognition.

== Theories of the nature of mind ==
Theories of the nature of mind aim to determine what all mental states have in common. They seek to discover the &quot;mark of the mental&quot;, that is, the criteria that distinguish mental from non-mental phenomena. Epistemic criteria say that the unique feature of mental states is how people know about them. For example, if a person has a toothache, they have direct or non-inferential knowledge that they are in pain. But they do not have this kind of knowledge about non-mental phenomena such as the physical causes of the pain, and may have to consult external evidence through visual inspection or a visit to the dentist. Another feature commonly ascribed to mental states is that they are private, meaning that others do not have direct access to a person&#x27;s mental state. As a result, external observers have to make inferences from other indicators, like the pain behavior of the person with the toothache. Some philosophers claim that knowledge of some or all mental states is infallible, for instance, that a person cannot be mistaken about whether they are in pain.

A related view asserts that all mental states are either conscious or accessible to consciousness. According to this view, when a person actively remembers the fact that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris then this state is mental because it is part of consciousness. When the person does not think about it, this belief is still considered a mental state because the person could bring it to consciousness by thinking about it. This view denies the existence of a &quot;deep unconsciousness&quot;, that is, unconscious mental states that cannot in principle become conscious.

Another theory says that intentionality is the mark of the mental. A state is intentional if it refers to or represents something. For example, if a person perceives a piano or thinks about it then the mental state is intentional because it refers to a piano. This view distinguishes between the original intentionality of mental phenomena and the derivative intentionality of some non-mental phenomena. According to this view, the ability of words and pictures to refer to things derives from the fact that they can evoke mental states. In this sense, only mental states have original intentionality, whereas words and pictures have derivative intentionality since they would not refer if divorced from linguistic conventions or visual interpretations. Some philosophers disagree that all mental states are intentional, citing itches, tickles, and pains as possible exceptions.

According to behaviorism, mental states are dispositions to engage in certain publicly observable behavior as a reaction to particular external stimuli. This view implies that mental phenomena are not private internal states but are accessible to empirical observation like regular physical phenomena. Functionalism agrees that mental states do not depend on the exact internal constitution of the mind and characterizes them instead in regard to their functional role. The functional role of a mental state is the way it interacts with other phenomena. For example, pain is often caused by bodily injury and typically leads to pain behavior, like moaning, and a desire to stop the pain. As a result, injury, pain behavior, and desire are part of the functional role of pain. Computationalism, a similar theory prominent in cognitive science, defines minds in terms of cognitions and computations as information processors.

Theories under the umbrella of externalism emphasize the mind&#x27;s dependency on the environment. According to this view, mental states and their contents are at least partially determined by external circumstances. For example, some forms of content externalism hold that it can depend on external circumstances whether a belief refers to one object or another. The position of embedded cognition emphasizes that mental processes happen in the context of a physical and social environments. It examines how this context shapes cognitive activity. The extended mind thesis states that external circumstances not only influence the mind but are part of it. In this sense, a diary is part of the mind by helping it store information. Similarly, an electronic calculator is part of the mind by helping it perform calculations. The closely related view of enactivism holds that mental processes involve an interaction between organism and environment. A theory from the field of embodied cognition states that the connection to a body is an essential feature of minds. It asserts that certain aspects of the body outside the nervous system, like motor capacities, are part of the mind.

== Relation to matter ==
=== Mind–body problem ===
The mind–body problem is the difficulty of providing a general explanation of the relationship between mind and body, for example, of the link between thoughts and brain processes. Despite their different characteristics, mind and body interact with each other, like when a bodily change causes mental discomfort or when a limb moves because of an intention. The mind–body problem came to particular prominence in modern philosophy as a result of Descartes&#x27; metaphysical distinction between mind and body. Earlier philosophers typically did not see mind and body as contrasting principles. Following Descartes&#x27; philosophy, minds were often conceived as substantial entities able to exist on their own. Now they are more commonly seen as capacities rather than independent entities.

According to substance dualism, minds or souls exist as independent entities in addition to material things. This view implies that, at least in principle, minds can exist without bodies. Property dualism is another view, saying that mind and matter are not independent entities but different properties that apply to the same individual. Monist views, by contrast, state that reality is made up of only one kind. According to metaphysical idealists, for instance, everything is mental. They understand material things as mental phenomena, for example, as ideas or perceptions. According to neutral monists, by contrast, the world is at its most fundamental level neither physical nor mental but neutral. They see physical and mental concepts as convenient but superficial ways to describe reality.

The monist view most influential since the 20th century has been physicalism, also referred to as materialism, which states that everything is physical. According to eliminative physicalism, there are no mental phenomena, meaning that things like beliefs and desires do not form part of reality. Reductive physicalists defend a less radical position: they say that mental states exist but can, at least in principle, be completely described by physics without the need for special sciences like psychology. For example, behaviorists aim to analyze mental concepts in terms of observable behavior without resorting to internal mental states. Type identity theory also belongs to reductive physicalism and says that mental states are the same as brain states. While non-reductive physicalists agree that everything is physical, they say that mental concepts describe physical reality on a more abstract level that cannot be articulated by physics. According to functionalism, mental concepts do not describe the internal constitution of physical substances but functional roles within a system. One consequence of this view is that mind does not depend on brains but can also be realized by other systems that implement the corresponding functional roles, possibly also computers. A different approach, found in the tradition of phenomenology, aims to dissolve the mind–body problem by arguing that it is based on an artificial dichotomy not present in the phenomenological description of experience.

The hard problem of consciousness is a central aspect of the mind–body problem: it is the challenge of explaining how physical states can give rise to conscious experience. Its main difficulty lies in the subjective and qualitative nature of consciousness, which is unlike typical physical processes. The hard problem of consciousness contrasts with the &quot;easy problems&quot; of explaining how certain aspects of consciousness function, such as perception, memory, or learning.

=== Brain areas and processes ===
Another approach to the relation between mind and matter uses empirical observation to study how the brain works and which brain areas and processes are associated with specific mental phenomena. The brain is the central organ of the nervous system and is present in all vertebrates and the majority of invertebrates. The human brain is of particular complexity and consists of about 86 billion neurons, which communicate with one another via synapses. They form a complex neural network and cognitive processes emerge from their electrical and chemical interactions. The human brain is divided into regions that are associated with different functions. The main regions are the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain. Many biological functions associated with basic survival are the responsibility of the hindbrain and midbrain. Higher mental functions, ranging from thoughts to motivation, are primarily localized in the forebrain.

The primary operations of many of the main mental phenomena are located in specific areas of the forebrain. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions, such as planning, decision-making, problem-solving, and working memory. The sensory cortex processes and interprets sensory information, with different subareas dedicated to different senses, like the visual and the auditory areas. A central function of the hippocampus is the formation and retrieval of long-term memories. It belongs to the limbic system, which plays a key role in the regulation of emotions through the amygdala. The motor cortex is responsible for planning, executing, and controlling voluntary movements. Broca&#x27;s area is a separate region dedicated to speech production. The activity of the different areas is additionally influenced by neurotransmitters, which are signaling molecules that enhance or inhibit different types of neural communication. For example, dopamine influences motivation and pleasure while serotonin affects mood and appetite.

The close interrelation of brain processes and the mind is seen by the effect that physical changes of the brain have on the mind. For instance, the consumption of psychoactive drugs, like caffeine, antidepressants, alcohol, and psychedelics, temporarily affects brain chemistry with diverse effects on the mind, ranging from increased attention to mood changes, impaired cognitive functions, and hallucinations. Long-term changes to the brain in the form of neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries can lead to permanent alterations in mental functions. Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in its first stage deteriorates the hippocampus, reducing the ability to form new memories and recall existing ones. An often-cited case of the effects of brain injury is Phineas Gage, whose prefrontal cortex was severely damaged during a work accident when an iron rod pierced through his skull and brain. Gage survived the accident but his personality and social attitude changed significantly as he became more impulsive, irritable, and anti-social while showing little regard for social conventions and an impaired ability to plan and make rational decisions. Not all these changes were permanent and Gage managed to recover and adapt in some areas.

== Development ==
=== Evolution ===
The mind has a long evolutionary history starting with the development of the nervous system and the brain. While it is generally accepted today that mind is not exclusive to humans and various non-human animals have some form of mind, there is no consensus at which point exactly the mind emerged. The evolution of mind is usually explained in terms of natural selection: genetic variations responsible for new or improved mental capacities, such as better perception or social dispositions, have an increased chance of being passed on to future generations if they are beneficial to survival and reproduction. 

Minimal forms of information processing are already found in the earliest forms of life 4 to 3.5 billion years ago, like the abilities of bacteria and eukaryotic unicellular organisms to sense the environment, store this information, and react to it. Nerve cells emerged with the development of multicellular organisms more than 600 million years ago as a way to process and transmit information. About 600 to 550 million years ago, an evolutionary bifurcation happened into radially symmetric organisms with ring-shaped nervous systems or a nerve net, like jellyfish, and organisms with bilaterally symmetric bodies, whose nervous systems tend to be more centralized. About 540 million years ago, vertebrates evolved within the group of bilaterally organized organisms. Vertebrates, like birds and mammals, have a central nervous system including a complex brain with specialized functions. Invertebrates, like clams and insects, typically either have no or relatively simple brains. In the course of evolution, the brains of vertebrates tended to grow and the specialization of different brain areas tended to increase. These developments are closely related to changes in limb structures, sense organs, and living conditions with a close correspondence between the size of a brain area and the importance of its function to the organism. An important step in the evolution of mammals about 200 million years ago was the development of the neocortex, which is responsible for many higher-order brain functions.

The size of the brain relative to the body further increased with the development of primates, like monkeys, about 65 million years ago and later with the emergence of the first hominins about 7–5 million years ago. Anatomically modern humans appeared about 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. Various theories of the evolutionary processes responsible for human intelligence have been proposed. The social intelligence hypothesis says that the evolution of the human mind was triggered by the increased importance of social life and its emphasis on mental abilities associated with empathy, knowledge transfer, and meta-cognition. According to the ecological intelligence hypothesis, the main value of the increased mental capacities comes from their advantages in dealing with a complex physical environment through processes like behavioral flexibility, learning, and tool use. Other suggested mechanisms include the effects of a changed diet with energy-rich food and general benefits from an increased speed and efficiency of information processing. Some models propose that another major cognitive shift occurred possibly 50,000 to 40,000 years ago. Called &quot;behavioral modernity&quot;, it is associated with the emergence of new or improved mental abilities, such as technological innovativeness, abstract thinking, the use of symbols, planning, and social coordination.

=== Individual ===
Besides the development of mind in general in the course of history, individual human minds also develop in the course of their lifetime. Some of the individual changes vary from person to person as a form of learning from experience, like forming specific memories or acquiring particular behavioral patterns. Others are more universal developments as psychological stages that all or most humans go through as they pass through early childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. These developments cover various areas, including intellectual, sensorimotor, linguistic, emotional, social, and moral developments. Some factors affect the development of mind before birth, such as nutrition, maternal stress, and exposure to harmful substances like alcohol during pregnancy.

Early childhood is marked by rapid developments as infants learn voluntary control over their bodies and interact with their environment on a basic level. Typically after about one year, this covers abilities like walking, recognizing familiar faces, and producing individual words. On the emotional and social levels, they develop attachments with their primary caretakers and express emotions ranging from joy and surprise to fear and anger. An influential theory by Jean Piaget divides the cognitive development of children into four stages. The sensorimotor stage from birth until two years is concerned with sensory impressions and motor activities while learning that objects remain in existence even when not observed. In the preoperational stage until seven years, children learn to interpret and use symbols in an intuitive manner. They start employing logical reasoning to physical objects in the concrete operational stage until eleven years and extend this capacity in the following formal operational stage to abstract ideas, probabilities, and possibilities. Other important processes shaping the mind in this period are socialization and enculturation, at first through primary caretakers and later through peers and the schooling system.

Psychological transformations during adolescence are provoked by physiological developments and by being confronted with a different social situation in the form of new expectations from others. An important factor in this period is change to the self-concept, which can take the form of an identity crisis. This process typically involves developing individuality and independence from parents while at the same time seeking closeness and conformity with friends and peers. Further developments in this period include improvements to the reasoning ability and the formation of a principled moral viewpoint.

The mind also changes during adulthood but in a less rapid and pronounced manner. Reasoning and problem-solving skills improve during early and middle adulthood. Some people experience the mid-life transition as a midlife crisis involving an inner conflict about personal identity, associated with anxiety, a sense of lack of accomplishments in life, or an awareness of mortality. Intellectual faculties tend to decline in later adulthood, specifically the ability to learn complex unfamiliar tasks and later also the ability to remember. At the same time, people tend to become more inward-looking and cautious.

== Non-human ==
=== Animal ===
It is commonly acknowledged today that animals have some form of mind, but it is controversial to which animals this applies and how their mind differs from the human mind. Different conceptions of the mind lead to different responses to this problem. When understood in a very wide sense as the capacity to process information, the mind is present in all forms of life, including insects, plants, and individual cells. On the other side of the spectrum are views that deny the existence of mentality in most or all non-human animals based on the idea that they lack key mental capacities, like abstract rationality and symbolic language. The status of animal minds is highly relevant to the field of ethics since it affects the treatment of animals, including the topic of animal rights.

Discontinuity views state that the minds of non-human animals are fundamentally different from human minds and often point to higher mental faculties, like thinking, reasoning, and deliberate decision-making. This outlook is reflected in the traditionally influential position of defining humans as &quot;rational animals&quot; as opposed to all other animals. Continuity views, by contrast, emphasize similarities and see cognitive differences in degree rather than kind. Central considerations for this position are the shared evolutionary origin and organic similarities on the level of brain and nervous system. Observable behavior is another key factor, such as problem-solving skills, animal communication, and reactions to and expressions of pain and pleasure. Of particular importance are the questions of consciousness and sentience, that is, to what extent non-human animals have a subjective experience of the world and are capable of suffering and feeling joy.

=== Artificial ===
Some of the difficulties of assessing animal minds are also reflected in the topic of artificial minds. It includes the question of whether computer systems implementing artificial intelligence should be considered a form of mind. This idea is consistent with some theories of the nature of mind, such as functionalism and its claim that mental concepts describe functional roles. It asserts that the functions implemented by biological brains could in principle also be implemented by artificial devices.

The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1912–1954), is a traditionally influential procedure to test artificial intelligence: a person exchanges messages with two parties, one of them a human and the other a computer. The computer passes the test if it is not possible to reliably tell which party is the human and which one the computer. While there are computer programs today that may pass the Turing test, this alone is usually not accepted as conclusive proof of mindedness. For some aspects of mind, it is controversial whether computers can, in principle, implement them, such as desires, feelings, consciousness, and free will.

This problem is often discussed through the contrast between weak and strong artificial intelligence. Weak or narrow artificial intelligence is limited to specific mental capacities or functions. It focuses on a particular task or a narrow set of tasks, like autonomous driving, speech recognition, or theorem proving. The goal of strong AI, also termed &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot;, is to create a complete artificial person that has all the mental capacities of humans, including consciousness, emotion, and reason. It is controversial whether strong AI is possible; influential arguments against it include John Searle&#x27;s Chinese Room Argument and Hubert Dreyfus&#x27;s critique based on Heideggerian philosophy.

== Mental health and disorder ==
Mental health is a state of mind characterized by internal equilibrium and well-being in which mental capacities function as they should. Some theorists emphasize positive features such as the abilities of a person to realize their potential, express and modulate emotions, cope with adverse life situations, and fulfill their social role. Negative definitions, by contrast, see mental health as the absence of mental disorders. Mental disorders are abnormal patterns of thought, emotion, or behavior. These patterns deviate not only from how a mental capacity works on average but from how it should work while usually causing some form of distress. The content of those norms is controversial and there are differences from culture to culture. For instance, homosexuality was historically considered a mental disorder by medical professionals, a view which only changed in the second half of the 20th century.

There is a great variety of mental disorders, each associated with a different form of malfunctioning. Anxiety disorders involve intense and persistent fear that is disproportionate to the actual threat and significantly impairs everyday life. An example is social phobia, which involves irrational fear of certain social situations. Anxiety disorders also include obsessive–compulsive disorder, for which the anxiety manifests in the form of intrusive thoughts that the person tries to alleviate by following compulsive rituals. Mood disorders cause intense moods or mood swings that are inconsistent with the external circumstances and can last for long periods. For instance, people affected by bipolar disorder experience extreme mood swings between manic states of euphoria and depressive states of hopelessness. Personality disorders are characterized by enduring patterns of maladaptive behavior that significantly impair regular life. Paranoid personality disorder, for example, leads people to be deeply suspicious of the motives of others without rational basis. Psychotic disorders are among the most severe mental illnesses and involve a distorted relation to reality in the form of hallucinations and delusions, as seen in schizophrenia. Other disorders include dissociative disorders and eating disorders.

The biopsychosocial model identifies three types of causes of mental disorders: biological, cognitive, and environmental factors. Biological factors include bodily causes, in particular neurological influences and genetic predispositions. On the cognitive level, maladaptive beliefs and patterns of thought can be responsible. Environmental factors involve cultural influences and social events that may trigger the onset of a disorder. There are various approaches to treating mental disorders, and the most suitable treatment usually depends on the type of disorder, its cause, and the individual&#x27;s overall condition. Psychotherapeutic methods use personal interaction with a therapist to change patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting. Psychoanalysis aims to help patients resolve conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious mind. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on conscious mental phenomena to identify and change irrational beliefs and negative thought patterns. Behavior therapy relies on classical conditioning to unlearn harmful behaviors. Humanistic therapies try to help people gain insight into their self-worth and empower them to resolve their problems. Drug therapies use medication to alter the brain chemistry involved in the disorder through substances like antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics.

== Fields and methods of inquiry ==
Various fields of inquiry study the mind, including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and cognitive science. They differ from each other in the aspects of mind they investigate and the methods they employ. The study of the mind poses various problems since it is difficult to directly examine, manipulate, and measure it. Trying to circumvent this problem by investigating the brain comes with new challenges of its own, mainly because of the brain&#x27;s complexity as a neural network consisting of billions of neurons, each with up to 10,000 links to other neurons.

=== Psychology ===
Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. It investigates conscious and unconscious mental phenomena, including perception, memory, feeling, thought, decision, intelligence, and personality. It is further interested in their outward manifestation in the form of observable behavioral patterns, studying how these patterns depend on external circumstances and are shaped by learning. Psychology is a wide discipline that includes many subfields. Cognitive psychology is interested in higher-order mental activities like thinking, problem-solving, reasoning, and concept formation. Biological psychology seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms on the physiological level and how they depend on genetic transmission and the environment. Developmental psychology studies the development of the mind from childhood to old age while social psychology examines the influence of social contexts on mind and behavior. Personality psychology investigates personality, exploring how characteristic patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior develop and vary among individuals. Further subfields include comparative, clinical, educational, occupational, and neuropsychology. As a scientific discipline, psychology emerged at the end of the 19th century from the experimental work of Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920). Early schools of thought included structuralism, psychoanalysis, Gestalt psychology, functionalism, and behaviorism.

Psychologists use a great variety of methods to study the mind. Experimental approaches set up a controlled situation, either in the laboratory or the field, in which they modify independent variables and measure their effects on dependent variables. This approach makes it possible to identify causal relations between the variables. For example, to determine whether people with similar interests (independent variable) are more likely to become friends (dependent variables), participants of a study could be paired with either similar or dissimilar participants. After giving the pairs time to interact, it is assessed whether the members of similar pairs have more positive attitudes toward one another than the members of dissimilar pairs.

Correlational methods examine the strength of association between two variables without establishing a causal relationship between them. The survey method presents participants with a list of questions aimed at eliciting information about their mental attitudes, behavior, and other relevant factors. It analyzes how participants respond to questions and how answers to different questions correlate with one another. Surveys usually have a large number of participants in contrast to case studies, which focus on an in-depth examination of a single subject or a small group of subjects, often to examine rare phenomena or explore new fields. Further methods include longitudinal studies, naturalistic observation, and phenomenological description of experience.

=== Neuroscience ===


Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system. Its primary focus is the central nervous system and the brain in particular, but it also investigates the peripheral nervous system mainly responsible for connecting the central nervous system to the limbs and organs. Neuroscience examines the implementation of mental phenomena on a physiological basis, covering various levels of analysis. On the small scale, it studies the molecular and cellular basis of the mind, dealing with the constitution of and interaction between individual neurons. On the large scale, it analyzes the architecture of the brain as a whole and its division into regions with different functions. The study of the nervous system began in the ancient period and evolved through the centuries, including anatomical insights through dissections and speculative theories about brain functions. Neuroscience was recognized as a distinct academic discipline in the 20th century as technological advances, like the development of neuroimaging techniques, revolutionized the field.

In modern neuroscience, neuroimaging techniques are of particular importance as the main research methods of neuroscientists. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures changes in the magnetic field of the brain associated with blood flow. Areas of increased blood flow indicate that the corresponding brain region is particularly active. Positron emission tomography (PET) uses radioactive substances to detect a range of metabolic changes in the brain. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical activity of the brain, usually by placing electrodes on the scalp and measuring the voltage differences between them. These techniques are often employed to measure brain changes under particular circumstances, for example, while engaged in a specific cognitive task. Important insights are also gained from patients and laboratory animals with brain damage, helping neuroscientists understand the function of the damaged area and how its absence affects the remaining brain.

=== Philosophy of mind ===
Philosophy of mind examines the nature of mental phenomena and their relation to the physical world. It seeks to understand the &quot;mark of the mental&quot;, that is, the features that all mental states have in common. It further investigates the essence of different types of mental phenomena, such as beliefs, desires, emotions, intentionality, and consciousness while exploring how they are related to one another. Philosophy of mind also examines solutions to the mind–body problem, like dualism, idealism, and physicalism, and assesses arguments for and against them. It asks whether people have a free will or the ability to choose their actions, and how this ability contrasts with the idea that everything is determined by preceding causes.

While philosophers of mind also include empirical considerations in their inquiry, they differ from fields like psychology and neuroscience by giving significantly more emphasis to non-empirical forms of inquiry. One such method is conceptual analysis, which aims to clarify the meaning of concepts, like &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;intention&quot;, by decomposing them to identify their semantic parts. Thought experiments are often used to evoke intuitions about abstract theories to assess their coherence and plausibility. To do so, philosophers imagine a situation relevant to a theory and employ counterfactual thinking to assess the possible consequences of this theory. Influential thought experiments include Mary the color scientist, philosophical zombies, and brain in a vat-scenarios. Because of the subjective nature of the mind, the phenomenological method is also commonly used to analyze the structure of consciousness by describing experience from the first-person perspective. The philosophical discussion of the mind has a long history, reaching back to antiquity. Influential contributions were made by Plato (), Aristotle (384–322 BCE), René Descartes (1596–1650), David Hume (1711–1776), Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), William James (1842–1910), and Gilbert Ryle (1900–1976).

=== Cognitive science ===
Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of mental processes. It aims to overcome the challenge of understanding something as complex as the mind by integrating research from diverse fields ranging from psychology and neuroscience to philosophy, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Unlike these disciplines, it is not a unified field but a collaborative effort. One difficulty in synthesizing their insights is that each of these disciplines explores the mind from a different perspective and level of abstraction while using different research methods to arrive at its conclusion. Cognitive science emerged in the second half of the 20th century as researchers from various disciplines began to examine how mental processes represent the world and transform information. The field expanded in the 1980s following advances in neuroimaging to include a biological perspective on how computational processes are implemented by the brain.

To incorporate insights from diverse disciplines, cognitive science relies on a unified conceptualization of minds as information processors. This means that mental processes are understood as computations that retrieve, transform, store, and transmit information. For example, perception retrieves sensory information from the environment and transforms it to extract meaningful patterns that can be used in other mental processes, such as planning and decision-making. Cognitive science relies on different levels of description to analyze cognitive processes. The most abstract level focuses on the basic problem the process is supposed to solve and the reasons why the organism needs to solve it. The intermediate level seeks to uncover the algorithm as a formal step-by-step procedure to solve the problem. The most concrete level asks how the algorithm is implemented through physiological changes on the level of the brain. Another methodology is to analyze the mind as a complex system composed of individual subsystems that can be studied independently of one another.

== Relation to other fields ==
The mind is relevant to many fields. In epistemology, the problem of other minds is the challenge of explaining how it is possible to know that people other than oneself have a mind. The difficulty arises from the fact that people directly experience their own minds but do not have the same access to the minds of others. According to a common view, it is necessary to rely on perception to observe the behavior of others and then infer that they have a mind based on analogical or abductive reasoning. Closely related to this problem is theory of mind in psychology, which is the ability to understand that other people possess beliefs, desires, intentions, and feelings that may differ from one&#x27;s own.

Anthropology is interested in how different cultures conceptualize the nature of mind and its relation to the world. These conceptualizations affect the way people understand themselves, experience illness, and interpret ritualistic practices as attempts to commune with spirits. Some cultures do not draw a strict boundary between mind and world by allowing that thoughts can pass directly into the world and manifest as beneficial or harmful forces. For instance, some indigenous beliefs systems, like traditional beliefs in the Azande culture, hold that angry thoughts can directly damage another person&#x27;s crops or make them ill. Other cultures strictly separate the mind from external reality, seeing it as an internal phenomenon without supernatural powers. Sociology is a related field concerned with the connections between mind, society, and behavior. Among other topics, it is interested in the phenomenon of intersubjectivity, which happens when different people have a shared understanding or experience, meaning that their cognitive perspectives overlap.

The concept of mind plays a central role in various religions. Buddhists say that there is no enduring self underlying mental activity. They analyze the mind as a stream of constantly changing experiences characterized by five aspects or &quot;aggregates&quot;: material form, feelings, perception, volition, and consciousness. Hindus, by contrast, affirm the existence of a permanent self. In an influential analogy, the human mind is compared to a horse-drawn chariot: the horses are the senses, which lure the sense mind corresponding to the reins through sensual pleasures. The senses are controlled by the charioteer embodying the intellect while the self is a passenger. In traditional Christian philosophy, mind and soul are closely intertwined as the immaterial aspect of humans that may survive bodily death. Islamic thought distinguishes between mind, spirit, heart, and self as interconnected aspects of the spiritual dimension of humans. Daoism and Confucianism use the concept of heart-mind as the center of cognitive and emotional life, encompassing thought, understanding, will, desire, and mood.

In the field of education, the minds of students are shaped through the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits as a process of socialization and enculturation. This is achieved through different teaching methods including the contrast between group work and individual learning and the use of instructional media. Teacher-centered education positions the teacher as the central authority controlling the learning process whereas in student-centered education, students have a more active role in shaping classroom activities. The choice of the most effective method to develop the minds of the learners is determined by various factors, including the topic and the learner&#x27;s age and skill level.

The mind is a frequent subject of pseudoscientific inquiry. Phrenology was an early attempt to correlate mental functions with specific brain areas. While its central claims about predicting mental traits by measuring bumps on the skull did not survive scientific scrutiny, the underlying idea that certain mental functions are localized in particular regions of the brain is now widely accepted. Parapsychologists seek to discover and study paranormal mental abilities ranging from clairvoyance to telepathy and telekinesis.

<text>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2October 186930January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India&#x27;s independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific [[Mahātmā]] (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and was called to the bar at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land tax.

Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women&#x27;s rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving &quot;swaraj&quot; or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short &quot;dhoti&quot; woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India&#x27;s rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.

Gandhi&#x27;s vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948, when Gandhi was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. 

Gandhi&#x27;s birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India. During India&#x27;s nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, he was also commonly called &quot;Bapu&quot;, an endearment roughly meaning &quot;father&quot;.
== Early life and background ==

=== Parents ===
Gandhi&#x27;s father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the &quot;dewan&quot; (chief minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State. Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister.

During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife&#x27;s permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had four children: a son, Laxmidas (–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); a second son, Karsandas (–1913). and a third son, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar (also known as &quot;Sudamapuri&quot;), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj.

In 1874, Gandhi&#x27;s father, Karamchand, left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state&#x27;s &quot;diwan&quot; a measure of security. In 1876, Karamchand became &quot;diwan&quot; of Rajkot and was succeeded as &quot;diwan&quot; of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. Karamchand&#x27;s family then rejoined him in Rajkot. They moved to their family home Kaba Gandhi No Delo in 1881.

=== Childhood ===

As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as &quot;restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs&#x27; ears.&quot; The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi writes: &quot;It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number.&quot; Gandhi&#x27;s early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.

The family&#x27;s religious background was eclectic. Mohandas was born into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family. Gandhi&#x27;s father, Karamchand, was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family. Gandhi&#x27;s father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya. His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible. Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who &quot;would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her.&quot;

At the age of nine, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography. At the age of 11, Gandhi joined the High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School. He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue-tied student, with no interest in games; Gandhi&#x27;s only companions were books and school lessons.

=== Marriage ===
In May 1883, the 13-year-old Gandhi was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to &quot;Kasturba&quot;, and affectionately to &quot;Ba&quot;) in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. Gandhi&#x27;s wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, &quot;As we didn&#x27;t know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives.&quot; As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents&#x27; house, and away from her husband.

Writing many years later, Gandhi described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride: &quot;Even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me.&quot; Gandhi later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when Kasturba would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.

In late 1885, Gandhi&#x27;s father, Karamchand, died. Gandhi had left his father&#x27;s bedside to be with his wife mere minutes before his passing. Many decades later, Gandhi wrote &quot;if animal passion had not blinded me, I should have been spared the torture of separation from my father during his last moments.&quot; Later, Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife, age 17, had their first child, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi. The Gandhis had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.

In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad. In January 1888, he enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. However, Gandhi dropped out and returned to his family in Porbandar.

Outside school, Gandhi&#x27;s education was enriched by exposure to Gujarati literature, especially reformers like Narmad and Govardhanram Tripathi, whose works alerted the Gujaratis to their own faults and weaknesses such as belief in religious dogmatism.

== Three years in London ==
=== Student of law ===

Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, Gandhi&#x27;s wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child, Harilal. Gandhi&#x27;s mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family and going so far from home. Gandhi&#x27;s uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew, but Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol, and women. Gandhi&#x27;s brother, Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi&#x27;s London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.

On 10 August 1888, Gandhi, aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. A local newspaper covering the farewell function by his old high school in Rajkot noted that Gandhi was the first Bania from Kathiawar to proceed to England for his Barrister Examination. As Mohandas Gandhi waited for a berth on a ship to London he found that he had attracted the ire of the Modh Banias of Bombay. Upon arrival in Bombay, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, Gandhi was excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off. Gandhi attended University College, London, where he took classes in English literature with Henry Morley in 1888–1889.

Gandhi also enrolled at the Inns of Court School of Law in Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister. His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal had continued through his teens. Gandhi retained these traits when he arrived in London, but joined a public speaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law.

Gandhi demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of London&#x27;s impoverished dockland communities. In 1889, a bitter trade dispute broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders, factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity. The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation of Cardinal Manning, leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work.

=== Vegetarianism and committee work ===

His vow to his mother influenced Gandhi&#x27;s time in London. Gandhi tried to adopt &quot;English&quot; customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he didn&#x27;t appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London&#x27;s few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt&#x27;s writing, Gandhi joined the London Vegetarian Society (LVS) and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor Arnold Hills. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter. Some of the vegetarians Gandhi met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original.

Gandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member Thomas Allinson. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.

Allinson had been promoting newly available birth control methods, but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills&#x27; views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson&#x27;s right to differ. It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. Hills bankrolled the LVS and was a captain of industry with his Thames Ironworks company employing more than 6,000 people in the East End of London. Hills was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club West Ham United. In his 1927 &quot;An Autobiography, Vol. I&quot;, Gandhi wrote:

A motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi&#x27;s shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. Gandhi wrote his views down on paper, but shyness prevented Gandhi from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson was excluded. There were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi&#x27;s return to India.

=== Called to the bar ===
Gandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from Gandhi. His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because Gandhi was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but Gandhi was forced to stop after running afoul of British officer Sam Sunny.

In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 (~$4,143 in 2023 money) plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least a one-year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.

== Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914) ==

In April 1893, Gandhi, aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah&#x27;s cousin. Gandhi spent 21 years in South Africa where he developed his political views, ethics, and politics. During this time Gandhi briefly returned to India in 1902 to mobilise support for the welfare of Indians in South Africa.

Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination due to his skin colour and heritage. Gandhi was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and was told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere, Gandhi was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. Gandhi sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. Gandhi chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.

When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Arthur Herman, he thought of himself as &quot;a Briton first, and an Indian second.&quot; However, the prejudice against Gandhi and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. Gandhi found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. Gandhi began to question his people&#x27;s standing in the British Empire.

The Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi as he prepared to return to India. The farewell party was turned into a working committee to plan the resistance to a new Natal government discriminatory proposal. This led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. Gandhi planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill&#x27;s passage, Gandhi&#x27;s campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, Gandhi moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him, and Gandhi escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, Gandhi refused to press charges against any member of the mob.

During the Boer War, Gandhi volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi wanted to disprove the British colonial stereotype that Hindus were not fit for &quot;manly&quot; activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim &quot;martial races.&quot; Gandhi raised 1,100 Indian volunteers to support British combat troops against the Boers. They were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. They were auxiliaries at the Battle of Colenso to a White volunteer ambulance corps. At the Battle of Spion Kop, Gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital since the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. Gandhi and 37 other Indians received the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal.

In 1906, the Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony&#x27;s Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time. According to Anthony Parel, Gandhi was also influenced by the Tamil moral text &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ&quot; after Leo Tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with &quot;A Letter to a Hindu&quot;. Gandhi urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. His ideas of protests, persuasion skills, and public relations had emerged. Gandhi took these back to India in 1915.

=== Europeans, Indians and Africans ===
Gandhi focused his attention on Indians and Africans while he was in South Africa. Initially, Gandhi was not interested in politics, but this changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach due to his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi&#x27;s thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. Gandhi entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi&#x27;s views on racism are contentious in some cases. He suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied Gandhi his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called Gandhi a &quot;parasite&quot;, &quot;semi-barbarous&quot;, &quot;canker&quot;, &quot;squalid coolie&quot;, &quot;yellow man&quot;, and other epithets. People would even spit on him as an expression of racial hate.

While in South Africa, Gandhi focused on the racial persecution of Indians before he started to focus on racism against Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, Gandhi&#x27;s behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation. During a speech in September 1896, Gandhi complained that the whites in the British colony of South Africa were &quot;degrading the Indian to the level of a raw Kaffir.&quot; Scholars cite it as an example of evidence that Gandhi at that time thought of Indians and black South Africans differently. As another example given by Herman, Gandhi, at the age of 24, prepared a legal brief for the Natal Assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for Indians. Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists&#x27; opinions that &quot;Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples&quot; and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.

Years later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism. The Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela is among admirers of Gandhi&#x27;s efforts to fight against racism in Africa. The general image of Gandhi, state Desai and Vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination as though Gandhi was always a saint, when in reality, his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths, and was one that changed over time. Scholars have also pointed the evidence to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the Apartheid.

In 1903, Gandhi started the &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;, a journal that carried news of Indians in South Africa, Indians in India with articles on all subjects -social, moral and intellectual. Each issue was multi-lingual and carried material in English, Gujarati, Hindi and Tamil. It carried ads, depended heavily on Gandhi&#x27;s contributions (often printed without a byline) and was an &#x27;advocate&#x27; for the Indian cause.

In 1906, when the Bambatha Rebellion broke out in the colony of Natal, the then 36-year-old Gandhi, despite sympathising with the Zulu rebels, encouraged Indian South Africans to form a volunteer stretcher-bearer unit. Writing in the &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;, Gandhi argued that military service would be beneficial to the Indian community and claimed it would give them &quot;health and happiness.&quot; Gandhi eventually led a volunteer mixed unit of Indian and African stretcher-bearers to treat wounded combatants during the suppression of the rebellion.

The medical unit commanded by Gandhi operated for less than two months before being disbanded. After the suppression of the rebellion, the colonial establishment showed no interest in extending to the Indian community the civil rights granted to white South Africans. 

By 1910, Gandhi&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;, was covering reports on discrimination against Africans by the colonial regime. Gandhi remarked that the Africans &quot;alone are the original inhabitants of the land. … The whites, on the other hand, have occupied the land forcibly and appropriated it for themselves.&quot;

In 1910, Gandhi established, with the help of his friend Hermann Kallenbach, an idealistic community they named Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg. There, Gandhi nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance.

In the years after black South Africans gained the right to vote in South Africa (1994), Gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments.

== Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947) ==
At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to Gandhi by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.

Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale&#x27;s liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.

Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration, but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942, and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi&#x27;s strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947, the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.

=== Role in World War I ===
In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi. Gandhi agreed to support the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled &quot;Appeal for Enlistment&quot;, Gandhi wrote: &quot;To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army.&quot; However, Gandhi stipulated in a letter to the Viceroy&#x27;s private secretary that he &quot;personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe.&quot;

Gandhi&#x27;s support for the war campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. Gandhi&#x27;s private secretary noted that &quot;The question of the consistency between his creed of &#x27;Ahimsa&#x27; (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since.&quot; According to political and educational scientist Christian Bartolf, Gandhi&#x27;s support for the war stemmed from his belief that true ahimsa could not exist simultaneously with cowardice. Therefore, Gandhi felt that Indians needed to be willing and capable of using arms before they voluntarily chose non-violence.

In July 1918, Gandhi said that he could not persuade even one individual to enlist for the world war. &quot;So far I have not a single recruit to my credit apart,&quot; Gandhi wrote. He added: &quot;They object because they fear to die.&quot;

=== Champaran agitations ===

Gandhi&#x27;s first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (&quot;Indigofera&quot; sp.), a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.

=== Kheda agitations ===

In 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of &quot;mamlatdars&quot; and &quot;talatdars&quot; (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.

=== Khilafat movement ===
In 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already vocally supported the British crown in the first world war. This decision of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with &quot;swaraj&quot; (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government had offered, instead of self-government, minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi. He announced his &quot;satyagraha&quot; (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi&#x27;s movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for &quot;preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial.&quot;

Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (&quot;ummah&quot;). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi&#x27;s support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi&#x27;s leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.

The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph&#x27;s cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt &quot;satyagraha&quot; demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi&#x27;s stature as the political leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped Gandhi sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the &quot;satyagraha&quot; non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. Though they agreed in general terms on Indian independence, they disagreed on the means of achieving this. Jinnah was mainly interested in dealing with the British via constitutional negotiation, rather than attempting to agitate the masses.

In 1922, the Khilafat movement gradually collapsed following the end of the non-cooperation movement with the arrest of Gandhi. A number of Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited, and deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.

=== Non-co-operation ===

With his book &quot;Hind Swaraj&quot; (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation. If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and &quot;swaraj&quot; (Indian independence) would come.

In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he would appeal to Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him and passed the law, stating it would not yield to threats. The &quot;satyagraha&quot; civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in &quot;satyagraha&quot; in Delhi.

People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, Gandhi asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but to express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they owned. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side used violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him not to enter Delhi, but Gandhi defied the order and was arrested on 9 April.

On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and British Indian Army officer Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered troops under his command to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent but was supported by some Britons and parts of the British media as a necessary response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using &#x27;love&#x27; to deal with the &#x27;hate&#x27; of the British government. Gandhi demanded that the Indian people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.

The massacre and Gandhi&#x27;s non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to &quot;swaraj&quot; and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind Gandhi, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.

Gandhi expanded his nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the &quot;swadeshi&quot; policy – the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that &quot;khadi&quot; (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning &quot;khadi&quot; in support of the independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.

The appeal of &quot;Non-cooperation&quot; grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years&#x27; imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. With Gandhi isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposing this move. Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Atatürk in Turkey. Muslim leaders left the Congress and began forming Muslim organisations. The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions. He was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only two years.

=== Salt Satyagraha (Salt March/Civil Disobedience Movement) ===

After his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, Gandhi continued to pursue &quot;swaraj&quot; over the second half of the 1920s. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After Gandhi&#x27;s support for World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.

The British did not respond favourably to Gandhi&#x27;s proposal. British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and Winston Churchill announced opposition to &quot;the appeasers of Gandhi&quot; in their discussions with European diplomats who sympathised with Indian demands. On 31 December 1929, an Indian flag was unfurled in Lahore. Gandhi led Congress in a celebration on 26 January 1930 of India&#x27;s Independence Day in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the British salt tax in March 1930. He sent an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, on 2 March. Gandhi condemned British rule in the letter, describing it as &quot;a curse&quot; that &quot;has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration... It has reduced us politically to serfdom.&quot; Gandhi also mentioned in the letter that the viceroy received a salary &quot;over five thousand times India&#x27;s average income.&quot; In the letter, Gandhi also stressed his continued adherence to non-violent forms of protest.

This was highlighted by the Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where, together with 78 volunteers, Gandhi marched from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way. Thousands of Indians joined him in Dandi. 

According to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because Gandhi feared he would be accused of using women as a political shield. When women insisted on joining the movement and participating in public demonstrations, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi&#x27;s apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. On 5 May, Gandhi was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned. The protest at Dharasana salt works on 21 May went ahead without Gandhi. A horrified American journalist, Webb Miller, described the British response thus:

This went on for hours until some 300 or more protesters had been beaten, many seriously injured and two killed. At no time did they offer any resistance. After Gandhi&#x27;s arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in the manner Gandhi inspired.

This campaign was one of Gandhi&#x27;s most successful at upsetting British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people. However, Congress estimates put the figure at 90,000. Among them was one of Gandhi&#x27;s lieutenants, Jawaharlal Nehru.

=== Gandhi as folk hero ===
Indian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi&#x27;s ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.

According to Dennis Dalton, it was Gandhi&#x27;s ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by &quot;brute force and immorality&quot;, contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by &quot;soul force and morality&quot;. Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning &quot;hate with love&quot;. These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too Gandhi was popular among the Indian indentured workers. After he returned to India, people flocked to Gandhi because he reflected their values.

Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases such as &quot;Rama-rajya&quot; from &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of &quot;swaraj&quot; and &quot;satyagraha&quot;. During Gandhi&#x27;s lifetime, these ideas sounded strange outside India, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.

=== Negotiations ===
The government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India&#x27;s independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin&#x27;s successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.

In Britain, Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:

Churchill&#x27;s bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. He called Gandhi as the one who was &quot;seditious in aim&quot; whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Churchill called him a dictator, a &quot;Hindu Mussolini&quot;, fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with Brahmin cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain. Churchill attempted to isolate Gandhi, and his criticism of Gandhi was widely covered by European and American press. It gained Churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for Gandhi among Europeans. The developments heightened Churchill&#x27;s anxiety that the &quot;British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience.&quot;

=== Round Table Conferences ===

During the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931–32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi&#x27;s authority to speak for all of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status, and divert the attention from India&#x27;s struggle to end the colonial rule.

The Second Round Table conference was the only time Gandhi left India between 1914 and his death in 1948. Gandhi declined the government&#x27;s offer of accommodation in an expensive West End hotel, preferring to stay in the East End, to live among working-class people, as he did in India. Gandhi based himself in a small cell-bedroom at Kingsley Hall for the three-month duration of his stay and was enthusiastically received by East Enders. During this time, Gandhi renewed his links with the British vegetarian movement.

After Gandhi returned from the Second Round Table conference, he started a new &quot;satyagraha&quot;. Gandhi was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It came to be known as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started a fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.

=== Congress politics ===
In 1934, Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party&#x27;s position, but felt that if he resigned, Gandhi&#x27;s popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party&#x27;s membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.

In 1936, Gandhi returned to active politics again with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India&#x27;s future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest. Despite Gandhi&#x27;s opposition, Bose won a second term as Congress President, against Gandhi&#x27;s nominee, Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya. Gandhi declared that Sitaramayya&#x27;s defeat was his defeat. Bose later left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by Gandhi.

=== World War II and &quot; Quit India movement&quot; ===
Gandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in World War II. The British government responded with the arrests of Gandhi and many other Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement. A number of violent attacks were also carried out by the nationalists against the British government. While Gandhi&#x27;s campaign did not enjoy the support of a number of Indian leaders, and over 2.5 million Indians volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the Allied Forces, the movement played a role in weakening the control over the South Asian region by the British regime and it ultimately paved the way for Indian independence.

Gandhi&#x27;s opposition to the Indian participation in World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. Gandhi also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to &quot;Quit India&quot; in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi&#x27;s and the Congress Party&#x27;s most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi&#x27;s speech arrested Gandhi and all the members of the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.

In 1942, Gandhi now nearing age 73, urged his people to completely stop co-operating with the imperial government. In this effort, Gandhi urged that they neither kill nor injure British people but be willing to suffer and die if violence is initiated by the British officials. He clarified that the movement would not be stopped because of any individual acts of violence, saying that the &quot;ordered anarchy&quot; of &quot;the present system of administration&quot; was &quot;worse than real anarchy.&quot; Gandhi urged Indians to &quot;karo ya maro&quot; (&quot;do or die&quot;) in the cause of their rights and freedoms.

Gandhi&#x27;s arrest lasted two years, as he was held in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, Gandhi&#x27;s longtime secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months&#x27; imprisonment on 22 February 1944, and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.

Gandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. Gandhi came out of detention to an altered political scene – the Muslim League for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, &quot;now occupied the centre of the political stage&quot; and the topic of Jinnah&#x27;s campaign for Pakistan was a major talking point. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence and the two men met several times over a period of two weeks in September 1944 at Jinnah&#x27;s house in Bombay, where Gandhi insisted on a united religiously plural and independent India which included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent coexisting. Jinnah rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate Muslim homeland (later Pakistan). These discussions continued through 1947.

While the leaders of Congress languished in jail, the other parties supported the war and gained organisational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point, Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress&#x27;s leadership.

=== Partition and independence ===

Gandhi opposed the partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines. The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India. However, the All-India Muslim League demanded &quot;Divide and Quit India.&quot; Gandhi suggested an agreement which required the Congress and the Muslim League to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority.

Jinnah rejected Gandhi&#x27;s proposal and called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for the partition of the Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal (excluding Cooch Behar), gave Calcutta&#x27;s police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, and tens of thousands were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.

Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, had worked with Gandhi and Jinnah to find a common ground, before and after accepting Indian independence in principle. Wavell condemned Gandhi&#x27;s character and motives as well as his ideas. Wavell accused Gandhi of harbouring the single-minded idea to &quot;overthrow British rule and influence and to establish a Hindu raj&quot;, and called Gandhi a &quot;malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd&quot; politician. Wavell feared a civil war on the Indian subcontinent, and doubted Gandhi would be able to stop it.

The British reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the Indian subcontinent, but accepted Jinnah&#x27;s proposal of partitioning the land into Pakistan and India. Gandhi was involved in the final negotiations, but Stanley Wolpert states the &quot;plan to carve up British India was never approved of or accepted by Gandhi&quot;.

The partition was controversial and violently disputed. More than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10 million to 12 million non-Muslims (Hindus and Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.

Gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule, but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Gandhi&#x27;s fasting and protests are credited for stopping the religious riots and communal violence.

== Death ==
At 5:17 p.m. on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into Gandhi&#x27;s chest from a pistol at close range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly. In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There, he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi&#x27;s family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.

Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressed his countrymen over the All-India Radio saying:

Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.

Godse, a Hindu nationalist, with links to the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, made no attempt to escape; several other conspirators were soon arrested as well. The accused were Nathuram Vinayak Godse, Narayan Apte, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Shankar Kistayya, Dattatraya Parchure, Vishnu Karkare, Madanlal Pahwa, and Gopal Godse.

The trial began on 27May 1948 and ran for eight months before Justice Atma Charan passed his final order on 10February 1949. The prosecution called 149 witnesses, the defence none. The court found all of the defendants except one guilty as charged. Eight men were convicted for the murder conspiracy, and others were convicted for violation of the Explosive Substances Act. Savarkar was acquitted and set free. Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were sentenced to death by hanging while the remaining six (including Godse&#x27;s brother, Gopal) were sentenced to life imprisonment.

=== Funeral and memorials ===
Gandhi&#x27;s death was mourned nationwide. Over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where Gandhi was assassinated, and another million watched the procession pass by. His body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of Gandhi&#x27;s body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead, four drag-ropes held by 50 people each pulled the vehicle. All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London.

Gandhi was cremated in accordance with Hindu tradition. His ashes were poured into urns which were sent across India for memorial services. Most of the ashes were immersed at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi immersed the contents of one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam at Allahabad. Some of Gandhi&#x27;s ashes were scattered at the source of the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles.

The Birla House site where Gandhi was assassinated is now a memorial called Gandhi Smriti. The place near Yamuna River where he was cremated is the Rāj Ghāt memorial in New Delhi. A black marble platform, it bears the epigraph &quot;Hē Rāma&quot; (Devanagari: &quot;हे ! राम&quot; or, &quot;Hey Raam&quot;). These are said to be Gandhi&#x27;s last words after he was shot.

== Principles, practices, and beliefs ==

Gandhi&#x27;s spirituality was greatly based on his embracement of the five great vows of Jainism and Hindu Yoga philosophy, viz. &quot;Satya&quot; (truth), &quot;ahimsa&quot; (nonviolence), &quot;brahmacharya&quot; (celibacy), &quot;asteya&quot; (non-stealing), and &quot;aparigraha&quot; (non-attachment). He stated that &quot;Unless you impose on yourselves the five vows you may not embark on the experiment at all.&quot; Gandhi&#x27;s statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present Gandhi as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.

=== Truth and Satyagraha ===

Gandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or &quot;Satya&quot;, and called his movement satyagraha, which means &quot;appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth.&quot; The first formulation of the &quot;satyagraha&quot; as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which Gandhi tabled as &quot;Resolution on Non-cooperation&quot; in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the &quot;satyagraha&quot; formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma.

Gandhi based &quot;Satyagraha&quot; on the Vedantic ideal of self-realisation, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love. William Borman states that the key to his &quot;satyagraha&quot; is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi&#x27;s ideas on &quot;ahimsa&quot; and &quot;satyagraha&quot; were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi&#x27;s synthesis was to politicise these ideas. His concept of &quot;satya&quot; as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood in the context of the Hindu terminology of Dharma and &quot;Ṛta&quot;.

Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said, &quot;God is Truth.&quot; Gandhi would later change this statement to &quot;Truth is God.&quot; Thus, &quot;satya&quot; (truth) in Gandhi&#x27;s philosophy is &quot;God&quot;. Gandhi, states Richards, described the term &quot;God&quot; not as a separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that &quot;atman&quot; exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this &quot;atman&quot;.

The essence of Satyagraha is &quot;soul force&quot; as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or &quot;purify&quot; the oppressor. It is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman, &quot;love conquers hate&quot;. A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a &quot;silent force&quot; or a &quot;soul force&quot; (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a &quot;universal force&quot;, as it essentially &quot;makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.&quot;

Gandhi wrote: &quot;There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one&#x27;s cause.&quot; Civil disobedience and non-co-operation as practised under Satyagraha are based on the &quot;law of suffering&quot;, a doctrine that &quot;the endurance of suffering is a means to an end&quot;. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-co-operation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.

While Gandhi&#x27;s idea of &quot;satyagraha&quot; as a political means attracted a widespread following among Indians, the support was not universal. For example, Muslim leaders such as Jinnah opposed the &quot;satyagraha&quot; idea, accused Gandhi to be reviving Hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter Gandhi with Muslim nationalism and a demand for Muslim homeland. The untouchability leader Ambedkar, in June 1945, after his decision to convert to Buddhism and the first Law and Justice minister of modern India, dismissed Gandhi&#x27;s ideas as loved by &quot;blind Hindu devotees&quot;, primitive, influenced by spurious brew of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and &quot;there is always some simpleton to preach them&quot;. Winston Churchill caricatured Gandhi as a &quot;cunning huckster&quot; seeking selfish gain, an &quot;aspiring dictator&quot;, and an &quot;atavistic spokesman of a pagan Hinduism.&quot; Churchill stated that the civil disobedience movement spectacle of Gandhi only increased &quot;the danger to which white people there [British India] are exposed.&quot;

=== Nonviolence ===
Although Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (&quot;ahimsa&quot;) has a long history in Indian religious thought, and is considered the highest dharma (ethical value/virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (&quot;sarvbhuta&quot;), at all times (&quot;sarvada&quot;), in all respects (&quot;sarvatha&quot;), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about &quot;ahimsa&quot; as a political means in his autobiography &quot;The Story of My Experiments with Truth&quot;.

Although Gandhi considered non-violence to be &quot;infinitely superior to violence&quot;, he preferred violence to cowardice. Gandhi added that he &quot;would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honor than that she should in a cowardly manner become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor.&quot;

== Literary works ==

Gandhi was a prolific writer. His signature style was simple, precise, clear and as devoid of artificialities. One of Gandhi&#x27;s earliest publications, &quot;Hind Swaraj&quot;, published in Gujarati in 1909, became &quot;the intellectual blueprint&quot; for India&#x27;s independence movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read &quot;No Rights Reserved&quot;. For decades, Gandhi edited several newspapers including &quot;Harijan&quot; in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; &quot;Indian Opinion&quot; while in South Africa and, &quot;Young India&quot;, in English, and &quot;Navajivan&quot;, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, &quot;Navajivan&quot; was also published in Hindi. Gandhi also wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.

Gandhi also wrote several books, including his autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Experiments with Truth (Gujarātī &quot;સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા&quot;)&quot;, of which Gandhi bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted. His other autobiographies included: &quot;Satyagraha in South Africa&quot; about his struggle there, &quot;Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule&quot;, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Unto This Last&quot; which was an early critique of political economy. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. Gandhi also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books. In 1934, Gandhi wrote &quot;Songs from Prison&quot; while prisoned in Yerawada jail in Maharashtra.

Gandhi&#x27;s complete works were published by the Indian government under the name &quot;&quot; in the 1960s. The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about 100 volumes. In 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a controversy, as it contained a large number of errors and omissions. The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.

== Legacy ==
Gandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian independence movement against the British rule. He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India. American historian Stanley Wolpert described Gandhi as &quot;India&#x27;s greatest revolutionary nationalist leader&quot; and the greatest Indian since the Buddha. In 1999, Gandhi was named &quot;Asian of the century&quot; by &quot;Asiaweek&quot;. In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium.

The word &quot;Mahatma&quot;, while often mistaken for Gandhi&#x27;s given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words &quot;maha&quot; (meaning &quot;Great&quot;) and &quot;atma&quot; (meaning &quot;Soul&quot;). He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title &quot;Mahatma&quot; in July 1914 at farewell meeting in Town Hall, Durban. Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi by 1915. In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.

Innumerable streets, roads, and localities in India are named after Gandhi. These include M.G.Road (the main street of a number of Indian cities including Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Kanpur, Gangtok and Indore), Gandhi Market (near Sion, Mumbai) and Gandhinagar (the capital of the state of Gujarat, Gandhi&#x27;s birthplace).

As of 2008, over 150 countries have released stamps on Gandhi. In October 2019, about 87 countries including Turkey, the United States, Russia, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Palestine released commemorative Gandhi stamps on the 150th anniversary of his birth.

In 2014, Brisbane&#x27;s Indian community commissioned a statue of Gandhi, created by Ram V. Sutar and Anil Sutar in the Roma Street Parkland, It was unveiled by Narendra Modi, then Prime Minister of India.

Florian asteroid 120461 Gandhi was named in his honour in September 2020. In October 2022, a statue of Gandhi was installed in Astana on the embankment of the rowing canal, opposite the cult monument to the defenders of Kazakhstan.

On 15 December 2022, the United Nations headquarters in New York unveiled the statue of Gandhi. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called Gandhi an &quot;uncompromising advocate for peaceful co-existence.&quot;

=== Followers and international influence ===
Gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements. Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence. King said, &quot;Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics.&quot; King sometimes referred to Gandhi as &quot;the little brown saint.&quot; Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was inspired by Gandhi. Others include Steve Biko, Václav Havel, and Aung San Suu Kyi.

In his early years, the former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi. Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as &quot;Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense, Mandela completed what Gandhi started.&quot;

Gandhi&#x27;s life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading his ideas. In Europe, Romain Rolland was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book &quot;Mahatma Gandhi&quot;, and Brazilian anarchist and feminist Maria Lacerda de Moura wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, physicist Albert Einstein exchanged letters with Gandhi and called him &quot;a role model for the generations to come&quot; in a letter writing about him. Einstein said of Gandhi:

Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s life achievement stands unique in political history. He has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.

Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.

Farah Omar, a political activist from Somaliland, visited India in 1930, where he met Gandhi and was influenced by Gandhi&#x27;s non-violent philosophy, which he adopted in his campaign in British Somaliland.

Lanza del Vasto went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread Gandhi&#x27;s philosophy and founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi&#x27;s ashrams). Madeleine Slade (known as &quot;Mirabehn&quot;) was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi.

In addition, the British musician John Lennon referred to Gandhi when discussing his views on nonviolence. In 2007, former US Vice-President and environmentalist Al Gore drew upon Gandhi&#x27;s idea of &quot;satyagraha&quot; in a speech on climate change. 44th President of the United States Barack Obama said in September 2009 that his biggest inspiration came from Gandhi. His reply was in response to the question: &quot;Who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?&quot; Obama added, &quot;He&#x27;s somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine named The 14th Dalai Lama, Lech Wałęsa, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Aung San Suu Kyi, Benigno Aquino Jr., Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela as &quot;Children of Gandhi&quot; and his spiritual heirs to nonviolence. The Mahatma Gandhi District in Houston, Texas, United States, an ethnic Indian enclave, is officially named after Gandhi.

Gandhi&#x27;s ideas had a significant influence on 20th-century philosophy. It began with his engagement with Romain Rolland and Martin Buber. Jean-Luc Nancy said that the French philosopher Maurice Blanchot engaged critically with Gandhi from the point of view of &quot;European spirituality.&quot; Since then philosophers including Hannah Arendt, Etienne Balibar and Slavoj Žižek found that Gandhi was a necessary reference to discuss morality in politics. American political scientist Gene Sharp wrote an analytical text, Gandhi as a political strategist, on the significance of Gandhi&#x27;s ideas, for creating nonviolent social change. Recently, in the light of climate change, Gandhi&#x27;s views on technology are gaining importance in the fields of environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology.

=== Global days that celebrate Gandhi ===
In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly declared Gandhi&#x27;s birthday, 2 October, as &quot;the International Day of Nonviolence&quot;. First proposed by UNESCO in 1948, as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace (DENIP in Spanish), 30 January is observed as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace in schools of many countries. In countries with a Southern Hemisphere school calendar, it is observed on 30 March.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Time&quot; magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930. In the same magazine&#x27;s 1999 list of The Most Important People of the Century, Gandhi was second only to Albert Einstein, who had called Gandhi &quot;the greatest man of our age.&quot; The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D. in 1937. The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa&#x27;s struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient. In 2003, Gandhi was posthumously awarded with the World Peace Prize. Two years later, he was posthumously awarded with the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo. In 2011, Gandhi topped the &quot;Time&quot;″s list of Top 25 Political Icons of All Time. 

Gandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee, though Gandhi made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947. Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that &quot;there was no suitable living candidate&quot;, and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, &quot;The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question.&quot; When the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was &quot;in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi.&quot; In the summer of 1995, the North American Vegetarian Society inducted Gandhi posthumously into the Vegetarian Hall of Fame.

==== Father of the Nation ====
Indians widely describe Gandhi as the Father of the Nation. Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as &quot;The Father of the Nation&quot;. On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;. He is also conferred the title &quot;Bapu&quot; (Gujarati: endearment for &quot;father&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;).

=== Film, theatre, and literature ===
* A five-hour, nine-minute long biographical documentary film, &quot;&quot;, made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi&#x27;s words and using black and white archival footage and photographs, captures the history of those times. 
* Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Gandhi&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. It was based on the biography by Louis Fischer. The 1996 film &quot;The Making of the Mahatma&quot; documented Gandhi&#x27;s time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader.
* Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 comedy film &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot;. Jahnu Barua&#x27;s &quot;Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara&quot; (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi&#x27;s values as a metaphor for the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.
* In the tale &quot;Le Jour du Jugement Dernier&quot;, in the collection &quot;Les Mémoires de Satan et autres contes loufoques&quot;, by Pierre Cormon, God tries to judge Gandhi at the Last Judgement but realises that the character is more complex than he appears.
* In 1967, Gandhi was set to be featured on the album cover of one of the best selling albums of The Beatles, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, however this idea was later cancelled due to respect for Gandhi.
* The 1979 opera &quot;Satyagraha&quot; by American composer Philip Glass is loosely based on Gandhi&#x27;s life. The opera&#x27;s libretto, taken from the Bhagavad Gita, is sung in the original Sanskrit.
* The 1995 Marathi play &quot;Gandhi Virudh Gandhi&quot; explored the relationship between Gandhi and his son Harilal. The 2007 film, &quot;Gandhi, My Father&quot; was inspired on the same theme. The 1989 Marathi play &quot;Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy&quot; and the 1997 Hindi play &quot;Gandhi Ambedkar&quot; criticised Gandhi and his principles.
* Several biographers have undertaken the task of describing Gandhi&#x27;s life. Among them are D. G. Tendulkar with his &quot;Mahatma. Life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi&quot; in eight volumes, Chaman Nahal&#x27;s Gandhi Quartet, and Pyarelal and Sushila Nayyar with their &quot;Mahatma Gandhi&quot; in 10 volumes. The 2010 biography, &quot;Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India&quot; by Joseph Lelyveld contained controversial material speculating about Gandhi&#x27;s sexual life. Lelyveld, however, stated that the press coverage &quot;grossly distort[s]&quot; the overall message of the book. The 2014 film &quot;Welcome Back Gandhi&quot; takes a fictionalised look at how Gandhi might react to modern day India. The 2019 play &quot;Bharat Bhagya Vidhata&quot;, inspired by Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai and produced by Sangeet Natak Akademi and Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur takes a look at how Gandhi cultivated the values of truth and non-violence.
* &quot;Mahatma Gandhi&quot; is used by Cole Porter in his lyrics for the song &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot; which is included in the 1934 musical &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. In the song, Porter rhymes &#x27;Mahatma Gandhi&#x27; with &#x27;Napoleon Brandy.&#x27;
* Gandhi is mentioned in the Kris Kristofferson song &quot;They Killed Him&quot;.

=== Current impact within India ===

India, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi&#x27;s economics but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory. Reporter Jim Yardley notes that &quot;modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one. His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power.&quot; By contrast, Gandhi is &quot;given full credit for India&#x27;s political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy.&quot;

Gandhi&#x27;s birthday, 2 October, is a national holiday in India, Gandhi Jayanti. His image also appears on paper currency of all denominations issued by Reserve Bank of India, except for the one rupee note. Gandhi&#x27;s date of death, 30 January, is commemorated as a Martyrs&#x27; Day in India.

There are three temples in India dedicated to Gandhi. One is located at Sambalpur in Odisha, the second at Nidaghatta village near Kadur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka, and the third at Chityal in the district of Nalgonda, Telangana. The Gandhi Memorial in Kanyakumari resembles central Indian Hindu temples and the Tamukkam or Summer Palace in Madurai now houses the Mahatma Gandhi Museum.

=== Descendants ===

Gandhi&#x27;s children and grandchildren live in India and other countries. Grandson Rajmohan Gandhi is a professor in Illinois and an author of Gandhi&#x27;s biography titled &quot;Mohandas&quot;, while another, Tarun Gandhi, has authored several authoritative books on his grandfather. Another grandson, Kanu Ramdas Gandhi (the son of Gandhi&#x27;s third son Ramdas), was found living at an old age home in Delhi despite having taught earlier in the United States.

<doc id="19381" wikidata="Q193344" url="?curid=19381" title="Miyamoto Musashi">
<text>, was a Japanese swordsman, strategist, artist, and writer who became renowned through stories of his unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 62 duels (next is 33 by Itō Ittōsai). Miyamoto is considered a &quot;kensei&quot; (sword saint) of Japan. He was the founder of the Niten Ichi-ryū, or Nito Ichi-ryū, style of swordsmanship, and in his final years authored and &quot;Dokkōdō&quot; (獨行道, &quot;The Path of Aloneness&quot;).

Both documents were given to Terao Magonojō, the most important of Miyamoto&#x27;s students, seven days before Musashi&#x27;s death. &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; deals primarily with the character of his Niten Ichi-ryū school in a concrete sense, i.e., his own practical martial art and its generic significance; &quot;The Path of Aloneness&quot;, on the other hand, deals with the ideas that lie behind it, as well as his life&#x27;s philosophy in a few short aphoristic sentences.

It is believed that Miyamoto was a friend of a Tokugawa shogunate general named Mizuno Katsunari and fought together with him in the Battle of Sekigahara, Siege of Osaka, and Shimabara Rebellion as part of the Tokugawa army.

The Miyamoto Musashi Budokan training center, located in Ōhara-chō (Mimasaka), Okayama Prefecture, Japan was erected to honor his name and legend.

==Biography==

The details of Miyamoto Musashi&#x27;s early life are difficult to verify. Musashi himself simply states in &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; that he was born in Harima Province. &quot;Niten Ki&quot; (an early biography of Musashi) supports the assertion that Musashi was born in 1584: &quot;[He] was born in Banshū, in Tenshō 12 [1584], the Year of the Monkey.&quot; The historian Kamiko Tadashi, commenting on Musashi&#x27;s text, notes: &quot;Munisai was Musashi&#x27;s father ... he lived in Miyamoto village, in the Yoshino district [of Mimasaka Province]. Musashi was most probably born here.&quot;

Musashi gives his full name and title in &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; as Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara no Harunobu (新免武蔵守藤原玄信). His father, Shinmen Munisai (新免無二斎) was an accomplished martial artist and master of the sword and &quot;jutte&quot; (also &quot;jitte&quot;). Munisai, in turn, was the son of Hirata Shōgen (平田将監), a vassal of Shinmen &quot;Iga no Kami&quot;, the lord of Takayama Castle in the Yoshino district of Mimasaka Province. Hirata was relied upon by Lord Shinmen and so was allowed to use the Shinmen name. &quot;Fujiwara&quot; was the lineage from which Musashi claimed descent.

Musashi&#x27;s eczema developed in his infancy, and this adversely affected his appearance. Another story claims that he never bathed himself because he did not want to be surprised unarmed.

According to Go Rin No Sho, Musashi testified that his first duel occurred when he was still 13 years old, against a swordsman named Arima Kihei who practiced Kashima Shintō-ryū martial arts that were created by Tsukahara Bokuden; Musashi was victorious. The second duel happened when Musashi was 16 years old, when he won another victory against a swordsman named Tadashima Akiyama, a native of Tajima Province. His third duel came when he was aged 21, in Kyoto, where he defeated several students of a famous sword fighting school.

===Travels 1599-1613===
In 1599, Musashi left his village, apparently at the age of 15 (according to the &quot;Tosakushi&quot;, &quot;The Registry of the Sakushu Region&quot;, although the &quot;Tanji Hokin Hikki&quot; says he was 16 years old in 1599, which agrees time-wise with the age reported in Musashi&#x27;s first duel). His family possessions such as furniture, weapons, genealogy, and other records were left with his sister and her husband, Hirao Yoemon. He spent his time traveling and engaging in duels.

In 1600, Musashi is said to have participated in the Battle of Sekigahara. For a long time, the prevailing opinion has been that Musashi participated in the Sekigahara battle on the Western Army side due to the fact that Shinmen clan was longtime vassal to the Ukita clan. However, recent research by modern Japanese historians such as Masahide Fukuda and Watanabe Daimon about Musashi has opined that Musashi and his father, Shinmen Munisai, actually sided with The Eastern army during the war, based on the historical records that Munisai no longer served the Ukita clan, and the clan records of Kuroda clan, ally of Tokugawa Ieyasu during the war, had recorded the name of Shinmen Munisai among their vassals who participated in the war. Daimon, who quoted the &quot;Matsui clan Document&quot;, has opined that the notion that Musashi fought on the losing side of Western Army, both in Sekigahara and in Osaka siege 14 years later, were only based on legendary romanticism about Musashi being a ronin. While the primary history records indicated that Musashi always fought on the side of Tokugawa, who emerged victorious in both conflicts. The main issue debated, was if Musashi fought in the Sekigahara battle with the Eastern Army main forces, under Tokugawa, or did he fight in Ishigakibaru of western province theater under the Eastern Army commander Kuroda Yoshitaka. Daimon more leaned to the opinion that Musashi fought in Ishigakibaru instead of Sekigahara, by historical record of &quot;The Transmission of Military Art to Master Bushu Genshin&quot; Meanwhile, Fukuda has pointed out that the name of Munisai appeared in Kuroda clan record under the category of &quot;Kogofudai&quot;, or Kuroda clan vassals who had entered service before 1586. Based on this fact, Fukuda concluded it was natural that Munisai and Musashi were on the Tokugawa side during the war, just as the Kuroda clan which they served.

Furthermore, Japanese History novelist Kengo Tominaga proposed a theory that Musashi during the Sekigahara Campaign did not fight in the main battle of Sekigahara, but instead he fought under Kuroda Yoshitaka against Ishida Mitsunari loyalists from the western provinces in the battle of Ishigakibaru, Ōita Prefecture.

In December 1608, It was reported that Musashi met with Mizuno Katsunari, a Tokugawa general. Musashi taught Katsunari the secret techniques of his swordstyle.

In 1611, Musashi learned zazen at Myōshin-ji Kyūshū after the Sekigahara battle. Musashi introduced to Nagaoka Sado an official of daimyo lord named Hosokawa Tadaoki. At sometimes in unclear circumstances, Musashi was challenged to a duel by a swordsman named Sasaki Kojirō. Musashi agreed to the challenge, and it was scheduled for them to fight on one year later, on 13 April, at Ganryūjima Island. When the date arrived, the island was filled with spectators intending to spectate the duel. Kojirō was known for fighting with a &quot;nodachi&quot;, a sword with a long blade.

Musashi, it is said, deliberately arrived late. During his journey to the island by boat, he had carved an oar into a &quot;bokken&quot;, or wooden practice sword. Kojirō had lost his patience while waiting, and he taunted Musashi for his late arrival, though the latter remained composed. The duel ended when Musashi quickly and fatally struck Kojirō, crushing his skull with a vertical stroke aimed to his head.

===Serving under Shogunate army===
In 1614, during the Siege of Osaka, it was believed that Musashi participated in Tokugawa army under the command of Musashi&#x27;s personal friend, Mizuno Katsushige or also known as Katsunari. Musashi were reportedly carrying the banner of Katsunari, and also acted as bodyguard of Mizuno Katsutoshi, son of Katsunari. It was said in a later era, during the Shimabara Rebellion, that Musashi once told a commander of the Tokugawa army that he had served under Mizuno Katsunari&#x27;s command during the Osaka siege and knew the military system very well. Miyamoto Mikinosuke, the adopted son of Musashi, also served under Katsunari during this battle.

In 1633, Musashi began staying with Hosokawa Tadatoshi, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kumamoto Castle, who had moved to the Kumamoto fief and Kokura, to train and paint. While he engaged in very few duels during this period, one occurred in 1634 at the arrangement of Lord Ogasawara, in which Musashi defeated a lance specialist named Takada Matabei. Musashi officially became the retainer of the Hosokawa lords of Kumamoto in 1640. The &quot;Niten Ki&quot; records &quot;[he] received from Lord Tadatoshi: 17 retainers, a stipend of 300 koku, the rank of &quot;ōkumigashira&quot; 大組頭, and Chiba Castle in Kumamoto as his residence.&quot;
In 1638, Musashi allegedly participated in the suppression of Shimabara Rebellion. In &quot;Munekyu (Katsunari)-sama&quot; journal, which is a collection of things that Katsunari Mizuno said after his retirement in 1639, there is a story about Mizuno&#x27;s army during the Shimabara Rebellion, where a man named Miyamoto Musashi entered the camp of general Ogasawara Nagatsugu, and Musashi has said, &quot;Last time (In Siege of Osaka), (Mizuno Katsunari) Hyuga-no-Kamidono&#x27;s clan had this, and i knew the military system very well.&quot; Musashi continues by saying, &quot;He is a great general that no one can match.&quot;

===Later life===
In the second month of 1641, Musashi wrote a work called the &quot;Hyoho Sanju Go&quot; (&quot;Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy&quot;) for Hosokawa Tadatoshi. This work overlapped and formed the basis for the later &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;. This was the year that his adopted son, Hirao Yoemon, became Master of Arms for the Owari fief. In 1642, Musashi suffered attacks of neuralgia, foreshadowing his future ill-health.

In 1643 he retired to a cave named &quot;Reigandō&quot; as a hermit to write &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;. He finished it in the second month of 1645. On the twelfth of the fifth month, sensing his impending death, Musashi bequeathed his worldly possessions, after giving his manuscript copy of &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; to the younger brother of Terao Magonojo, his closest disciple. He died in Reigandō cave around 13 June 1645 (&quot;Shōhō 2, 19th day of the 5th month&quot;). The &quot;Hyoho senshi denki&quot; described his death:

Miyamoto Musashi died in 1645 after allegedly suffering from lung cancer.

==Timeline==

The following timeline of Musashi biography in chronological order (of which is based on the most accurate and most widely accepted information).

==Personal life==
It was said that Musashi practiced the way of the warrior and warfare strategy, which entailed the mastery of many art forms beyond that of the sword, such as tea ceremony (sadō), laboring, writing, and painting, all of which Musashi pursued throughout his life.

Writings on Musashi&#x27;s life rarely mention his relationship with women, and often when they do, Musashi is regularly depicted as rejecting sexual advances in favor of focusing on his swordsmanship. Alternative interpretations have taken his lack of interest as an indication of homosexuality. In contrast, many legends feature Musashi in trysts with women, some of which also reflect the view that he eventually chose to forego physical or emotional investments to attain further insight into his work.

This predominant cultural view of Musashi is somewhat contradicted by old texts such as &quot;Dobo goen&quot; (1720) which relay his intimacy with the courtesan Kumoi in his middle age. The &quot;Bushu Denraiki&quot; details Musashi fathering a daughter by a courtesan. It is uncertain if this courtesan and Kumoi were the same person. A rumor also connected Musashi with the &quot;oiran&quot; .

===Niten Ichi Ryu===

Musashi created and refined a two-sword &quot;kenjutsu&quot; technique called &quot;niten&#x27;ichi&quot; (二天一, &quot;two heavens as one&quot;) or &quot;nitōichi&quot; (二刀一, &quot;two swords as one&quot;) or &#x27;Niten Ichi-ryū&#x27; (A Kongen Buddhist Sutra refers to the two heavens as the two guardians of Buddha). In this technique, the swordsman uses &quot;both&quot; a large sword, and a &quot;companion sword&quot; at the same time, i.e. a katana with a wakizashi.

The two-handed movements of temple drummers may have inspired him, although it could be that the technique was forged through Musashi&#x27;s combat experience. &quot;Jitte&quot; techniques were taught to him by his father—the &quot;jitte&quot; was often used in battle paired with a sword; the &quot;jitte&quot; would parry and neutralize the weapon of the enemy while the sword struck or the practitioner grappled with the enemy. Today Musashi&#x27;s style of swordsmanship is known as Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū.

Musashi was also an expert in throwing weapons. He frequently threw his short sword, and Kenji Tokitsu believes that shuriken methods for the wakizashi were the Niten Ichi Ryu&#x27;s secret techniques.

Within the book, Musashi mentions that the use of two swords within strategy is equally beneficial to those who use the skill for individual duels or large engagements. The idea of using two hands for a sword is an idea that Musashi opposes because there is no fluidity in movement with two hands: &quot;If you hold a sword with both hands, it is difficult to wield it freely to left and right, so my method is to carry the sword in one hand.&quot; He also disagrees with the idea of using a sword with two hands on a horse and/or riding on unstable terrain, such as muddy swamps, rice fields, or within crowds of people.

To learn the strategy of Ni-Ten Ichi Ryū, Musashi asserts that by training with two long swords, one in each hand, one will be able to overcome the cumbersome nature of using a sword in both hands. Although it is difficult, Musashi agrees that there are times in which the long sword must be used with two hands, but one skillful enough should not need it.

After using two long swords proficiently enough, mastery of a long sword, and a &quot;companion sword&quot;, most likely a wakizashi, will be much increased: &quot;When you become used to wielding the long sword, you will gain the power of the Way and wield the sword well.&quot;

In short, it could be seen, from the excerpts from &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;, that real strategy behind Ni-Ten No Ichi Ryu, is that there is no real iron-clad method, path, or type of weaponry specific to the style of Ni-Ten No Ichi Ryu:

===Religion===
Even from an early age, Musashi separated his religion from his involvement in swordsmanship. Excerpts such as the one below, from &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;, demonstrate a philosophy that is thought to have stayed with him throughout his life:

However, the belief that Musashi disliked Shinto is inaccurate, as he criticises the Shintō-ryū style of swordsmanship, not Shinto, the religion. In Musashi&#x27;s &quot;Dokkōdō&quot;, his stance on religion is further elucidated: &quot;Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.&quot;

===As an artist===

In his later years, Musashi said in his &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;: &quot;When I apply the principle of strategy to the ways of different arts and crafts, I no longer have need for a teacher in any domain.&quot; He proved this by creating recognized masterpieces of calligraphy and classic ink painting. His paintings are characterized by skilled use of ink washes and an economy of brush stroke. He especially mastered the &quot;broken ink&quot; school of landscapes, applying it to other subjects, such as his &quot;Kobokumeikakuzu&quot; (&quot;Shrike Perched on a Withered Branch&quot;; part of a triptych whose other two members were &quot;Hotei Walking&quot; and &quot;Sparrow on Bamboo&quot;), his &quot;Hotei Watching a Cockfight&quot;, and his &quot;Rozanzu&quot; (&quot;Wild Geese Among Reeds&quot;). The Book of Five Rings advocates involvement in calligraphy and other arts as a means of training in the art of war.

Musashi also known as talented sumi-e who produced several paintings such as: &quot;Shrike Perched in a Dead Tree&quot; (&quot;Koboku Meigekizu&quot;, 枯木鳴鵙図) and &quot;Wild Geese Among Reeds&quot; (&quot;Rozanzu&quot;, 魯山図).

==In Japanese and global culture==

===Miyamoto Musashi Budokan===
On 20 May 2000, at the initiative of Sensei Tadashi Chihara the Miyamoto Musashi Budokan was inaugurated. It was built in Ōhara-Cho in the province of Mimasaka, the birthplace of the samurai. Inside the building, the life and journey of Miyamoto Musashi are remembered everywhere. Dedicated to martial arts, the Budokan is the source for all of Japan&#x27;s official traditional saber and kendo schools. Practically, historically and culturally it is a junction for martial disciplines in the heart of traditional Japan dedicated to Musashi.

The inauguration of the Miyamoto Musashi Budokan perpetuated the twinning established on 4 March 1999, between the inhabitants of Ōhara-Chō (Japanese province of Mimasaka) and the inhabitants of Gleizé. It was formalized in the presence of Sensei Tadashi Chihara, guarantor and tenth in the lineage of Miyamoto Musashi carrying a mandate from the mayor of Ōhara-Chō, and in the presence of the mayor of Gleizé Élisabeth Lamure. This event was extended during the mandate of the new mayor of Ōhara-Chō Fukuda Yoshiaki, by the official invitation from Japan and the consequent visit of the mayor of Gleizé for the inauguration of the Miyamoto Musashi Budokan on 10 May 2000, in the presence of personalities and Japanese authorities.

===In popular culture===

In Musashi&#x27;s time, there were fictional texts resembling comic books and it is difficult to separate fact from fiction when discussing his life. There have been works of fiction made about or featuring Musashi. Eiji Yoshikawa&#x27;s novelization (originally a 1930s daily newspaper serial) has greatly influenced successive fictional depictions (including the manga &quot;Vagabond&quot; by Takehiko Inoue) and is often mistaken for a factual account of Musashi&#x27;s life. In 2012, writer Sean Michael Wilson and Japanese artist Chie Kutsuwada published an attempt at a more historically accurate manga entitled &quot;The Book of Five Rings: A Graphic Novel&quot;, based on research and translations by William Scott Wilson.

&quot;Onimusha&quot;, a video game series by Capcom, features Musashi as a secret playable character in &quot;Onimusha Blade Warriors&quot;, 2026&#x27;s Onimusha: Way of the Sword will also see him returning as the lead character, with his likeness modelled after actor Toshiro Mifune.

The 1994 video game &quot;Live A Live&quot; and its 2022 remake feature Musashi as a boss in the game&#x27;s Twilight of Edo Japan chapter.

The 2008 video game &quot;Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan!&quot; was based on his life and personality.

He also appeared in the manga &quot;Baki the Grappler&quot; as a revived clone of himself with his real soul intact as one of the strongest fighters in the series, and used his two-sword style in most combat in which he was shown.

The card game &quot;&quot; has a card based on him, Isshin, Two Heavens as One, named for his two swords as one technique.

In the 2017 video game &quot;For Honor&quot;, the &quot;Aramusha&quot; hero is loosely inspired by Musashi. The character is a ronin who wields two swords.

The 2023 anime Onimusha was based loosely on the video game franchise of the same name and produced by Netflix. The series portrays a fictional version of an aging Musashi who embarks on a journey to defeat supernatural forces of evil using the Oni Gauntlet.

In Japanese live action series Kamen Rider Ghost, Musashi is the first of many Luminary Eyecons that Takeru Tenkuuji uses as Kamen Rider Ghost.

The song &quot;Sun and Steel&quot; by heavy metal band Iron Maiden off the album Piece of Mind is based on Miyamoto&#x27;s life.

<text>Multivariate statistics is a subdivision of statistics encompassing the simultaneous observation and analysis of more than one outcome variable, i.e., &quot;multivariate random variables&quot;. 
Multivariate statistics concerns understanding the different aims and background of each of the different forms of multivariate analysis, and how they relate to each other. The practical application of multivariate statistics to a particular problem may involve several types of univariate and multivariate analyses in order to understand the relationships between variables and their relevance to the problem being studied.

In addition, multivariate statistics is concerned with multivariate probability distributions, in terms of both
:*how these can be used to represent the distributions of observed data;
:*how they can be used as part of statistical inference, particularly where several different quantities are of interest to the same analysis.

Certain types of problems involving multivariate data, for example simple linear regression and multiple regression, are &quot;not&quot; usually considered to be special cases of multivariate statistics because the analysis is dealt with by considering the (univariate) conditional distribution of a single outcome variable given the other variables.

==Multivariate analysis==
Multivariate analysis (MVA) is based on the principles of multivariate statistics. Typically, MVA is used to address situations where multiple measurements are made on each experimental unit and the relations among these measurements and their structures are important. A modern, overlapping categorization of MVA includes: 
* Normal and general multivariate models and distribution theory
* The study and measurement of relationships
* Probability computations of multidimensional regions
* The exploration of data structures and patterns

Multivariate analysis can be complicated by the desire to include physics-based analysis to calculate the effects of variables for a hierarchical &quot;system-of-systems&quot;. Often, studies that wish to use multivariate analysis are stalled by the dimensionality of the problem. These concerns are often eased through the use of surrogate models, highly accurate approximations of the physics-based code. Since surrogate models take the form of an equation, they can be evaluated very quickly. This becomes an enabler for large-scale MVA studies: while a Monte Carlo simulation across the design space is difficult with physics-based codes, it becomes trivial when evaluating surrogate models, which often take the form of response-surface equations.

===Types of analysis===
Many different models are used in MVA, each with its own type of analysis:
# Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) extends the analysis of variance to cover cases where there is more than one dependent variable to be analyzed simultaneously; see also Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA).
#Multivariate regression attempts to determine a formula that can describe how elements in a vector of variables respond simultaneously to changes in others. For linear relations, regression analyses here are based on forms of the general linear model. Some suggest that multivariate regression is distinct from multivariable regression, however, that is debated and not consistently true across scientific fields.
# Principal components analysis (PCA) creates a new set of orthogonal variables that contain the same information as the original set. It rotates the axes of variation to give a new set of orthogonal axes, ordered so that they summarize decreasing proportions of the variation.
# Factor analysis is similar to PCA but allows the user to extract a specified number of synthetic variables, fewer than the original set, leaving the remaining unexplained variation as error. The extracted variables are known as latent variables or factors; each one may be supposed to account for covariation in a group of observed variables.
# Canonical correlation analysis finds linear relationships among two sets of variables; it is the generalised (i.e. canonical) version of bivariate correlation.
# Redundancy analysis (RDA) is similar to canonical correlation analysis but allows the user to derive a specified number of synthetic variables from one set of (independent) variables that explain as much variance as possible in another (independent) set. It is a multivariate analogue of regression.
# Correspondence analysis (CA), or reciprocal averaging, finds (like PCA) a set of synthetic variables that summarise the original set. The underlying model assumes chi-squared dissimilarities among records (cases).
# Canonical (or &quot;constrained&quot;) correspondence analysis (CCA) for summarising the joint variation in two sets of variables (like redundancy analysis); combination of correspondence analysis and multivariate regression analysis. The underlying model assumes chi-squared dissimilarities among records (cases).
# Multidimensional scaling comprises various algorithms to determine a set of synthetic variables that best represent the pairwise distances between records. The original method is principal coordinates analysis (PCoA; based on PCA).
# Discriminant analysis, or canonical variate analysis, attempts to establish whether a set of variables can be used to distinguish between two or more groups of cases.
# Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) computes a linear predictor from two sets of normally distributed data to allow for classification of new observations.
# Clustering systems assign objects into groups (called clusters) so that objects (cases) from the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different clusters.
# Recursive partitioning creates a decision tree that attempts to correctly classify members of the population based on a dichotomous dependent variable.
# Artificial neural networks extend regression and clustering methods to non-linear multivariate models.
# Statistical graphics such as tours, parallel coordinate plots, scatterplot matrices can be used to explore multivariate data.
# Simultaneous equations models involve more than one regression equation, with different dependent variables, estimated together.
# Vector autoregression involves simultaneous regressions of various time series variables on their own and each other&#x27;s lagged values.
# Principal response curves analysis (PRC) is a method based on RDA that allows the user to focus on treatment effects over time by correcting for changes in control treatments over time.
# Iconography of correlations consists in replacing a correlation matrix by a diagram where the “remarkable” correlations are represented by a solid line (positive correlation), or a dotted line (negative correlation).

===Dealing with incomplete data===
It is very common that in an experimentally acquired set of data the values of some components of a given data point are missing. Rather than discarding the whole data point, it is common to &quot;fill in&quot; values for the missing components, a process called &quot;imputation&quot;.

==Important probability distributions==
There is a set of probability distributions used in multivariate analyses that play a similar role to the corresponding set of distributions that are used in univariate analysis when the normal distribution is appropriate to a dataset. These multivariate distributions are:
:*Multivariate normal distribution
:*Wishart distribution
:*Multivariate Student-t distribution.
The Inverse-Wishart distribution is important in Bayesian inference, for example in Bayesian multivariate linear regression. Additionally, Hotelling&#x27;s T-squared distribution is a multivariate distribution, generalising Student&#x27;s t-distribution, that is used in multivariate hypothesis testing.

==History==
C.R. Rao made significant contributions to multivariate statistical theory throughout his career, particularly in the mid-20th century. One of his key works is the book titled &quot;Advanced Statistical Methods in Biometric Research,&quot; published in 1952. This work laid the foundation for many concepts in multivariate statistics.
Anderson&#x27;s 1958 textbook,&quot; An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis&quot;, educated a generation of theorists and applied statisticians; Anderson&#x27;s book emphasizes hypothesis testing via likelihood ratio tests and the properties of power functions: admissibility, unbiasedness and monotonicity.

MVA was formerly discussed solely in the context of statistical theories, due to the size and complexity of underlying datasets and its high computational consumption. With the dramatic growth of computational power, MVA now plays an increasingly important role in data analysis and has wide application in Omics fields.

<text>Money laundering is the process of illegally concealing the origin of money obtained from illicit activities (often known as dirty money) such as drug trafficking, underground sex work, terrorism, corruption, embezzlement, and treason, and converting the funds into a seemingly legitimate source, usually through a front organization. Money laundering is illegal; the acts generating the money almost always are themselves criminal in some way (for if not, the money would not need to be laundered). As financial crime has become more complex and financial intelligence is more important in combating international crime and terrorism, money laundering has become a prominent political, economic, and legal debate. Most countries implement some anti-money-laundering measures.

In the past, the term &quot;money laundering&quot; was applied only to financial transactions related to organized crime. Today its definition is often expanded by government and international regulators such as the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to mean &quot;any financial transaction which generates an asset or a value as the result of an illegal act,&quot; which may involve actions such as tax evasion or false accounting. In the UK, it does not need to involve money, but any economic good. Courts involve money laundering committed by private individuals, drug dealers, businesses, corrupt officials, members of criminal organizations such as the Mafia, and even states.

In United States law, money laundering is the practice of engaging in financial transactions to conceal the identity, source, or destination of illegally gained money. In United Kingdom law, the common law definition is wider. The act is defined as &quot;the process by which the proceeds of crime are converted into assets which appear to have a legitimate origin, so that they can be retained permanently or recycled into further criminal enterprises&quot;.

==History==
While existing laws were used to fight money laundering during the period of Prohibition in the United States during the 1930s, dedicated Anti-Money Laundering legislation was only implemented in the 1980s. Organized crime received a major boost from Prohibition and a large source of new funds that were obtained from illegal sales of alcohol. The successful prosecution of Al Capone on tax evasion brought in a new emphasis by the state and law enforcement agencies to track and confiscate money, but existing laws against tax evasion could not be used once gangsters started paying their taxes.

In the 1980s, the war on drugs led governments again to turn to money laundering rules in an attempt to track and seize the proceeds of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit, from a law enforcement point of view, of turning rules of evidence &quot;upside down&quot;. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to seize their property, but with civil forfeiture laws, money can be confiscated and it is up to the individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate to get the money back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.

However, this process has been abused by some law enforcement agencies to take and keep money without strong evidence of related criminal activity, to be used to supplement their own budgets. Civil asset forfeiture has been harshly criticized by civil liberties advocates for its greatly reduced standards for conviction, reverse onus, financial conflicts of interests arising when the law enforcement agencies who decide whether or not to seize assets stand to keep those assets for themselves, and violation of separation of powers and due process.

The 11 September attacks in 2001, which led to the Patriot Act in the U.S. and similar legislation worldwide, led to a new emphasis on money laundering laws to combat terrorism financing. The Group of Seven (G7) nations used the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering to put pressure on governments around the world to increase surveillance and monitoring of financial transactions and share this information between countries. Starting in 2002, governments around the world upgraded money laundering laws and surveillance and monitoring systems of financial transactions. Anti-money laundering regulations have become a much larger burden for financial institutions and enforcement has stepped up significantly.

During 2011–2015 a number of major banks faced ever-increasing fines for breaches of money laundering regulations. This included HSBC, which was fined $1.9 billion in December 2012, and BNP Paribas, which was fined $8.9 billion in July 2014 by the U.S. government. Many countries introduced or strengthened border controls on the amount of cash that can be carried and introduced central transaction reporting systems where all financial institutions have to report all financial transactions electronically. For example, in 2006, Australia set up the AUSTRAC system and required the reporting of all financial transactions.

With the surge in digital asset late 2010s, there&#x27;s been a noticeable rise in money laundering and fraud tied to cryptocurrency. In 2021 alone, cybercriminals managed to secure US$14 billion in cryptocurrency through various illicit activities.

Chinese organized criminal groups have become the principal money launderers for drug cartels in Mexico, Italy, and elsewhere.

===Definition===
Money laundering is the conversion or transfer of property; the concealment or disguising of the nature of the proceeds; the acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing that these are derived from criminal acts; the participating in or assisting the movement of funds to make the proceeds appear legitimate.

Money obtained from certain crimes, such as extortion, insider trading, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal gambling is &quot;dirty&quot; and needs to be &quot;cleaned&quot; to appear to have been derived from legal activities, so that banks and other financial institutions will deal with it without suspicion. Money can be laundered by many methods that vary in complexity and sophistication.

Money laundering typically involves three steps: The first involves introducing cash into the financial system by some means (&quot;placement&quot;); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source of the cash (&quot;layering&quot;); and finally, acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds (&quot;integration&quot;). Some of these steps may be omitted, depending on the circumstances. For example, non-cash proceeds that are already in the financial system would not need to be placed.

According to the United States Treasury Department:
===Methods===

====List of methods====
Money laundering can take several forms, although most methodologies can be categorized into one of a few types. These include &quot;bank methods, smurfing [also known as structuring], currency exchanges, and double-invoicing&quot;.
* Structuring: Often known as &quot;smurfing&quot;, is a method of placement whereby cash is broken into smaller deposits of money, used to defeat suspicion of money laundering and to avoid anti-money laundering reporting requirements. A sub-component of this is to use smaller amounts of cash to purchase bearer instruments, such as money orders, and then ultimately deposit those, again in small amounts.
* Bulk cash smuggling: This involves physically smuggling cash to another jurisdiction and depositing it in a financial institution, such as an offshore bank, that offers greater bank secrecy or less rigorous money laundering enforcement.
* Cash-intensive businesses: In this method, a business is typically expected to receive a large proportion of its revenue as cash uses its accounts to deposit criminally derived cash. This method of money laundering often causes organized crime and corporate crime to overlap. Such enterprises often operate openly and in doing so generate cash revenue from incidental legitimate business in addition to the illicit cash. In such cases, the business will usually claim all cash received as legitimate earnings. Service businesses are best suited to this method, as such enterprises have little or no variable costs and/or a large ratio between revenue and variable costs, which makes it difficult to detect discrepancies between revenues and costs. Examples are parking structures, strip clubs, tanning salons, car washes, arcades, bars, restaurants, casinos, barber shops, DVD stores, movie theaters, and beach resorts.
* Trade-based laundering: This method is one of the newest and most complex forms of money laundering. This involves under- or over-valuing invoices to disguise the movement of money. For example, the art market has been accused of being an ideal vehicle for money laundering due to several unique aspects of art such as the subjective value of artworks as well as the secrecy of auction houses about the identity of the buyer and seller. According to the National Crime Agency, one strategy that is favored by high-net-worth individuals is specialist storage facilities. Art kept in these spaces has been used by individuals to evade sanctions and launder the proceeds of crime.
* Shell companies and trusts: Trusts and shell companies disguise the true owners of money. Trusts and corporate vehicles, depending on the jurisdiction, need not disclose their true owner. Sometimes referred to by the slang term &quot;rathole&quot;, though that term usually refers to a person acting as the fictitious owner rather than the business entity.
* Round-tripping: Here, money is deposited in a controlled foreign corporation offshore, preferably in a tax haven where minimal records are kept, and then shipped back as a foreign direct investment, exempt from taxation. A variant of this is to transfer money to a law firm or similar organization as funds on account of fees, then to cancel the retainer and, when the money is remitted, represent the sums received from the lawyers as a legacy under a will or proceeds of litigation.
* Bank capture: In this case, money launderers or criminals buy a controlling interest in a bank, preferably in a jurisdiction with weak money laundering controls, and then move money through the bank without scrutiny.
* Invoice Fraud: An example is when a criminal contacts a company saying that the supplier payment details have changed. They then provide alternative, fraudulent details in order for you to pay them money.
* Casinos: In this method, an individual walks into a casino and buys chips with illicit cash. The individual will then play for a relatively short time. When the person cashes in the chips, they will expect to take payment in a check, or at least get a receipt so they can claim the proceeds as gambling winnings.
* Other gambling: Money is spent on gambling, preferably on high odds games. One way to minimize risk with this method is to bet on every possible outcome of some event that has many possible outcomes, so no outcome(s) have short odds, and the bettor will lose only the vigorish and will have one or more winning bets that can be shown as the source of money. The losing bets will remain hidden.
* Black salaries: A company may have unregistered employees without written contracts and pay them cash salaries. Dirty money might be used to pay them.
* Tax amnesties: For example, those that legalize unreported assets and cash in tax havens.
* Transaction Laundering: When a merchant unknowingly processes illicit credit card transactions for another business. It is a growing problem and recognised as distinct from traditional money laundering in using the payments ecosystem to hide that the transaction even occurred (e.g. the use of fake front websites). Also known as &quot;undisclosed aggregation&quot; or &quot;factoring&quot;.
* Online job marketplaces such as Freelancer.com and Fiverr, which accept funds from clients and hold them in escrow to pay freelancers. A money launderer can post a token job on one of these sites, and send the money for the site to hold in escrow. The launderer (or his associate) can then sign on as a freelancer (using a different account and IP address), accept and complete the job, and be paid the funds.
* Through Sports: Investigation teams have identified sport profits as a common way to launder money. In Latin America, in particular, drug traffickers are frequently found to own Soccer Clubs, and to launder money through their intermediate, by buying and selling players, selling tickets and merchandise

====Digital electronic money====
In theory, electronic money should provide as easy a method of transferring value without revealing identity as untracked banknotes, especially wire transfers involving anonymity-protecting numbered bank accounts. In practice, however, the record-keeping capabilities of Internet service providers and other network resource maintainers tend to frustrate that intention. While some cryptocurrencies under recent development have aimed to provide more possibilities of transaction anonymity for various reasons, the degree to which they succeed — and, in consequence, the degree to which they offer benefits for money laundering efforts — is controversial. Solutions such as ZCash and Monero ― known as &quot;privacy coins&quot; ― are examples of cryptocurrencies that provide unlinkable anonymity via proofs and/or obfuscation of information (ring signatures). While not suitable for large-scale crimes, privacy coins like Monero are suitable for laundering money made through small-scale crimes.

Apart from traditional cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are also commonly used in connection with money laundering activities. NFTs are often used to perform Wash Trading by creating several different wallets for one individual, generating several fictitious sales and consequently selling the respective NFT to a third party. According to a report by Chainalysis, these types of wash trades are becoming increasingly popular among money launderers especially due to the largely anonymous nature of transactions on NFT marketplaces. Auction platforms for NFT sales may face regulatory pressure to comply with anti-money laundering legislation.

Additionally, cryptocurrency mixers have been increasingly used by cybercriminals over the past decade to launder funds. A mixer blends the cryptocurrencies of many users together to obfuscate the origins and owners of funds, enabling a greater degree of privacy on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although not explicitly illegal in many jurisdictions, the legality of mixers is controversial. The use of the mixer Tornado Cash in the laundering of funds by the Lazarus Group led the Office of Foreign Assets Control to sanction it, prompting some users to sue the Treasury Department. Proponents have argued mixers allow users to protect their privacy and that the government lacks the authority to restrict access to decentralized software. In the United States, FinCEN requires mixers to register as money service businesses.

In 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC ISIS, surveyed new techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. A common approach was to use a digital currency exchanger service which converted dollars into a digital currency called Liberty Reserve, and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013, the US authorities shut down Liberty Reserve, charging its founder and various others with money laundering.

Another increasingly common way of laundering money is to use online gaming. In a growing number of online games, such as &quot;Second Life&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft,&quot; it is possible to convert money into virtual goods, services, or virtual cash that can later be converted back into money.

To avoid the usage of decentralized digital money such as Bitcoin for the profit of crime and corruption, Australia is planning to strengthen the nation&#x27;s anti-money laundering laws. The characteristics of Bitcoin—it is completely deterministic, protocol-based and can be difficult to censor—make it possible to circumvent national laws using services like Tor to obfuscate transaction origins. Bitcoin relies completely on cryptography, not on a central entity running under a KYC framework. There are several cases in which criminals have cashed out a significant amount of Bitcoin after ransomware attacks, drug dealings, cyber fraud and gunrunning. However, many digital currency exchanges are now operating KYC programs under threat of regulation from the jurisdictions they operate.

====Reverse money laundering====
Reverse money laundering is a process that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes. It is usually perpetrated for the purpose of financing terrorism but can be also used by criminal organizations that have invested in legal businesses and would like to withdraw legitimate funds from official circulation. Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay &quot;under-the-table&quot; salaries. For example, in an affidavit filed on 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascua alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator Leland Yee, engaged in reverse money laundering activities.

The problem of such fraudulent encashment practices (&quot;obnalichka&quot; in Russian) has become acute in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) reported that the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, Serbia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Kazakhstan have encountered a substantial shrinkage of tax base and shifting money supply balance in favor of cash. These processes have complicated the planning and management of the economy and contributed to the growth of the shadow economy.

===Magnitude===
Many regulatory and governmental authorities issue estimates each year for the amount of money laundered, either worldwide or within their national economy. In 1996, a spokesperson for the IMF estimated that 2–5% of the worldwide global economy involved laundered money. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering, stated, &quot;Due to the illegal nature of the transactions, precise statistics are not available and it is therefore impossible to produce a definitive estimate of the amount of money that is globally laundered every year. The FATF therefore does not publish any figures in this regard.&quot; Academic commentators have likewise been unable to estimate the volume of money with any degree of assurance. Various estimates of the scale of global money laundering are sometimes repeated often enough to make some people regard them as factual—but no researcher has overcome the inherent difficulty of measuring an actively concealed practice.

Regardless of the difficulty in measurement, the amount of money laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large-scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as an adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come &quot;from&quot;, and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going &quot;to&quot;). Finally, people, vessels, organisations and governments can be sanctioned due to international law-breaking, war (and of course tit-for-tat sanctions), and still want to move funds into markets where they are &quot;persona non grata&quot;.

Transaction laundering is a massive and growing problem. Finextra estimated that transaction laundering accounted for over $200 billion in the US in 2017 alone, with over $6 billion of these sales involving illicit goods or services, sold by nearly 335,000 unregistered merchants. Money laundering can erode democracy.

<text>Midwifery is the health science and health profession that deals with pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period (including care of the newborn), in addition to the sexual and reproductive health of women throughout their lives. In many countries, midwifery is a medical profession (special for its independent and direct specialized education; should not be confused with the medical specialty, which depends on a previous general training). A professional in midwifery is known as a midwife.

A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that &quot;most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications.&quot; The review found that midwifery-led care was associated with a reduction in the use of epidurals, with fewer episiotomies or instrumental births, and a decreased risk of losing the baby before 24 weeks&#x27; gestation. However, midwifery-led care was also associated with a longer mean length of labor as measured in hours.

==Main areas of midwifery==
=== Pregnancy ===
==== First trimester ====
Trimester means &quot;three months&quot;. A normal pregnancy lasts about nine months and has three trimesters.

First trimester screening varies by country. Women are typically offered urinalysis (UA) and blood tests including a complete blood count (CBC), blood typing (including Rh screen), syphilis, hepatitis, HIV, and rubella testing. Additionally, women may have chlamydia testing via a urine sample, and women considered at high risk are screened for sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Women must consent to all tests before they are carried out. The woman&#x27;s blood pressure, height and weight are measured. Her past pregnancies and family, social, and medical history are discussed. Women may have an ultrasound scan during the first trimester which may be used to help find the estimated due date. Some women may have genetic testing, such as screening for Down syndrome. Diet, exercise, and common disorders of pregnancy such as morning sickness are discussed.
====Second trimester====
The mother visits the midwife monthly or more often during the second trimester. The mother&#x27;s partner and/or the birth companion may accompany her. The midwife will discuss pregnancy issues such as fatigue, heartburn, varicose veins, and other common problems such as back pain. Blood pressure and weight are monitored and the midwife measures the mother&#x27;s abdomen to see if the baby is growing as expected. Lab tests such as a UA, CBC, and glucose tolerance test are done if clinically indicated.

====Third trimester====
In the third trimester the midwife will see the mother every two weeks until week 36 and every week after that. Weight, blood pressure, and abdominal measurements will continue to be done. Lab tests such as a CBC and UA may be done with additional testing done for at-risk pregnancies. The midwife palpates the woman&#x27;s abdomen to establish the lie, presentation and position of the fetus and later, the engagement. A pelvic exam may be done to see if the mother&#x27;s cervix is dilating. The midwife and the mother discuss birthing options and write a birth care plan.

=== Childbirth ===
==== Labor and delivery ====


Midwives are qualified to assist with a normal vaginal delivery while more complicated deliveries are handled by a health care provider who has had further training. Childbirth is divided into four stages.

:First stage of labor The first stage of labour involves the opening of the cervix. In the early parts of this stage the cervix will become soft and thin thus preparing for the delivery of the baby. The first stage of labour is complete when the cervix has dilated the full 10cm. During the first stage of labor the mother begins to feel strong and regular contractions that come every 5 to 20 minutes and last 30 to 60 seconds. Contractions gradually become stronger, more frequent, and longer lasting.

:Second stage of labor During the second stage the baby begins to move down the birth canal. As the baby moves to the opening of the vagina it &quot;crowns&quot;, meaning the top of the head can be seen at the vaginal entrance. At one time an &quot;episiotomy&quot;, (an incision in the tissue at the opening of the vagina) was done routinely because it was believed that it prevented excessive tearing and healed more readily than a natural tear. However, more recent research shows that a surgical incision may be more extensive than a natural tear, and is more likely to contribute to later incontinence and pain during sex than a natural tear would have.

:The midwife assists the baby as needed and when fully emerged, cuts the umbilical cord. If desired, either of the baby&#x27;s parents may cut the cord. In the past the cord was cut shortly after birth, but there is growing evidence that delayed cord clamping may benefit the infant.

:Third stage of labor The third stage of labour is where the mother must deliver the placenta. In order for the mother to do this they may need to push. Just like the contractions in the first stage of labour they may experience one or two of these. The midwife may assist the mother in delivering the placenta by gently pulling on the umbilical cord.

:Fourth stage of labor The fourth stage of labor is the period beginning immediately after the birth and extending for about six weeks. The World Health Organization describes this period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies. Until recently babies were routinely removed from their mothers following birth, however beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother&#x27;s chest) is of benefit to both mother and infant. As of 2014, early skin-to-skin contact is endorsed by all major organizations that are responsible for the well-being of infants. Thus, to help establish bonding and successful breastfeeding, the midwife carries out immediate mother and infant assessments as the infant lies on the mother&#x27;s chest and removes the infant for further observations only after they have had their first breastfeed.

Following the birth, if the mother had an episiotomy or a tearing of the perineum, it is sutured. The midwife does regular assessments for uterine contraction, fundal height, and vaginal bleeding. Throughout labor and delivery the mother&#x27;s vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, and pulse) are closely monitored and her fluid intake and output are measured. The midwife also monitors the baby&#x27;s pulse rate, palpates the mother&#x27;s abdomen to monitor the baby&#x27;s position, and does vaginal examinations as indicated. If the birth deviates from the norm at any stage, the midwife requests assistance from the multi-disciplinary team.

==== Birthing positions ====
Until the last century most women have used both the upright position and alternative positions to give birth. The lithotomy position was not used until the advent of forceps in the seventeenth century and since then childbirth has progressively moved from a woman supported experience in the home to a medical intervention within the hospital.
There are significant advantages to assuming an upright position in labor and birth, such as stronger and more efficient uterine contractions aiding cervical dilatation, increased pelvic inlet and outlet diameters and improved uterine contractility. Upright positions in the second stage include sitting, squatting, kneeling, and being on hands and knees.

===Postpartum period===
For women who have a hospital birth, the minimum hospital stay is six hours. Women who leave before this do so against medical advice. Women may choose when to leave the hospital. Full postnatal assessments are conducted daily whilst inpatient, or more frequently if needed. A postnatal assessment includes the woman&#x27;s observations, general well-being, breasts (either a discussion and assistance with breastfeeding or a discussion about lactation suppression), abdominal palpation (if she has not had a caesarean section) to check for involution of the uterus, or a check of her caesarean wound (the dressing does not need to be removed for this), a check of her perineum, particularly if she tore or had stitches, reviewing her lochia, ensuring she has passed urine and had her bowels open and checking for signs and symptoms of a DVT. The baby is also checked for jaundice, signs of adequate feeding, or other concerns. The baby has a nursery exam between six and seventy two hours of birth to check for conditions such as heart defects, hip problems, or eye problems.

In the community, the community midwife sees the woman at least until day ten. This does not mean she sees the woman and baby daily, but she cannot discharge them from her care until day ten at the earliest. Postnatal checks include neonatal screening test (NST, or heel prick test) around day five. The baby is weighed and the midwife plans visits according to the health and needs of mother and baby. They are discharged to the care of the health visitor.

===Care of the newborn===
At birth, the baby receives an Apgar score at, at the least, one minute and five minutes of age. This is a score out of 10 that assesses the baby on five different areas—each worth between 0 and 2 points. These areas are: colour, respiratory effort, tone, heart rate, and response to stimuli. The midwife checks the baby for any obvious problems, weighs the baby, and measure head circumference. The midwife ensures the cord has been clamped securely and the baby has the appropriate name tags on (if in hospital). Babies lengths are not routinely measured. The midwife performs these checks as close to the mother as possible and returns the baby to the mother quickly. Skin-to-skin is encouraged, as this regulates the baby&#x27;s heart rate, breathing, oxygen saturation, and temperature—and promotes bonding and breastfeeding.

In some countries, such as Chile, the midwife is the professional who can direct neonatal intensive care units. This is an advantage for these professionals, who can use the knowledge of perinatology to bring a high quality care of the newborn, with medical or surgical conditions.

==Midwifery-led continuity of care==
Midwifery-led continuity of care is where one or more midwives have the primary responsibility for the continuity of care for childbearing women, with a multidisciplinary network of consultation and referral with other health care providers. This is different from &quot;medical-led care&quot; where an obstetrician or family physician is primarily responsible. In &quot;shared-care&quot; models, responsibility may be shared between a midwife, an obstetrician and/or a family physician. The midwife is part of very intimate situations with the mother. For this reason, many say that the most important thing to look for in a midwife is comfort with them, as one will go to them with every question or problem.

According to a Cochrane review of public health systems in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, &quot;most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications.&quot; Midwifery-led care has effects including the following:
* a reduction in the use of epidurals, with fewer episiotomies or instrumental births.
* a longer mean length of labour as measured in hours
* increased chances of being cared for in labour by a midwife known by the childbearing woman
* increased chances of having a spontaneous vaginal birth
* decreased risk of preterm birth
* decreased risk of losing the baby before 24 weeks&#x27; gestation, although there appears to be no differences in the risk of losing the baby after 24 weeks or overall
There was no difference in the number of Caesarean sections. All trials in the Cochrane review included licensed midwives, and none included lay or traditional midwives. Also, no trial included out of hospital birth.

Compared to women in other care models, women in continuity models of midwifery care are more satisfied with their care. The updated version of the also shows a cost-saving effect in continuity models, compared to other midwifery models of care.

In continuity models of midwifery care, the midwife-woman relationship is developing over time. The deepened relationship has shown to be of great importance and is in a systematic review described as &quot;the viechle through which personalised care, trust and empowerment are achieved in the continuity of care midwifery model&quot;.

In some cultures, midwifery is the most traditional way of carrying out a pregnancy and childbirth, and it has been conducted for multiple generations. Child birthing women in these cultures, take Zimbabwe for example, feel that health facilities are not as comforting as cultural roots of care. Also, according to the World Health Organization, women should be able to have their children where ever they feel the most safe, so if having a midwife and proceeding with an at-home birth is what makes some women feel safe, then midwifery-led continuity of care might be the best option for them.

==History==
===Ancient history===

In ancient Egypt, midwifery was a recognized female occupation, as attested by the Ebers Papyrus which dates from 1900 to 1550 BCE. Five columns of this papyrus deal with obstetrics and gynecology, especially concerning the acceleration of parturition (the action or process of giving birth to offspring) and the birth prognosis of the newborn. The Westcar papyrus, dated to 1700 BCE, includes instructions for calculating the expected date of confinement and describes different styles of birth chairs. Bas reliefs in the royal birth rooms at Luxor and other temples also attest to the heavy presence of midwifery in this culture.

Midwifery in Greco-Roman antiquity covered a wide range of women, including old women who continued folk medical traditions in the villages of the Roman Empire, trained midwives who garnered their knowledge from a variety of sources, and highly trained women who were considered physicians. However, there were certain characteristics desired in a &quot;good&quot; midwife, as described by the physician Soranus of Ephesus in the 2nd century. He states in his work, &quot;Gynecology&quot;, that &quot;a suitable person will be literate, with her wits about her, possessed of a good memory, loving work, respectable and generally not unduly handicapped as regards her senses [i.e., sight, smell, hearing], sound of limb, robust, and, according to some people, endowed with long slim fingers and short nails at her fingertips.&quot; Soranus also recommends that the midwife be of sympathetic disposition (although she need not have borne a child herself) and that she keep her hands soft for the comfort of both mother and child. Pliny, another physician from this time, valued nobility and a quiet and inconspicuous disposition in a midwife. There appears to have been three &quot;grades&quot; of midwives present: The first was technically proficient; the second may have read some of the texts on obstetrics and gynecology; but the third was highly trained and reasonably considered a medical specialist with a concentration in midwifery.

Agnodice or Agnodike (Gr. Ἀγνοδίκη) was the earliest historical, and likely apocryphal, midwife mentioned among the ancient Greeks.

Midwives were known by many different titles in antiquity, ranging from &quot;iatrinē&quot; (Gr. nurse), &quot;maia&quot; (Gr., midwife), &quot;obstetrix&quot; (Lat., obstetrician), and &quot;medica&quot; (Lat., doctor). It appears as though midwifery was treated differently in the Eastern end of the Mediterranean basin as opposed to the West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of midwife (&quot;maia&quot;) to that of gynaecologist (&quot;iatros gynaikeios&quot;, translated as &quot;women&#x27;s doctor&quot;), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman legal provisions strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors. One example of such a midwife is Salpe of Lemnos, who wrote on women&#x27;s diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.

However, in the Roman West, information about practicing midwives comes mainly from funerary epitaphs. Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at a small sample of these epitaphs. The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin. Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom. It is not known from these epitaphs how certain slave women were selected for training as midwives. Slave girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.

The actual duties of the midwife in antiquity consisted mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the midwife would call for the assistance of a physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the midwife brought along two or three assistants. In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her. The midwife sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards on the top of the mother&#x27;s abdomen.

Finally, the midwife received the infant, placed it in pieces of cloth, cut the umbilical cord, and cleansed the baby. The child was sprinkled with &quot;fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre&quot; to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby&#x27;s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call on whether or not an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for congenital deformities and testing its cry to hear whether or not it was robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant&#x27;s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.

A 2nd-century terracotta relief from the Ostian tomb of Scribonia Attice, wife of physician-surgeon M. Ulpius Amerimnus, details a childbirth scene. Scribonia was a midwife and the relief shows her in the midst of a delivery. A patient sits in the birth chair, gripping the handles and the midwife&#x27;s assistant stands behind her providing support. Scribonia sits on a low stool in front of the woman, modestly looking away while also assisting the delivery by dilating and massaging the vagina, as encouraged by Soranus.

The services of a midwife were not inexpensive; this fact that suggests poorer women who could not afford the services of a professional midwife often had to make do with female relatives. Many wealthier families had their own midwives. However, the vast majority of women in the Greco-Roman world very likely received their maternity care from hired midwives. They may have been highly trained or possessed only a rudimentary knowledge of obstetrics. Also, many families had a choice of whether or not they wanted to employ a midwife who practiced the traditional folk medicine or the newer methods of professional parturition. Like a lot of other factors in antiquity, quality gynecological care often depended heavily on the socioeconomic status of the patient.

===Post-classical history===


===Early Modern history===

Midwives were usually older, married or widowed women with their own grown children. However, this was not an absolute, but a commonly recognized pattern. Many midwives were teenagers or unmarried. Throughout the seventeenth century, the literacy of English midwives was quite high, usually surpassing the clientele base they served. By 1634, most English midwives in London could read, which is important since many of them may not have been able to write, only leaving a simple mark as their signature. By the 1660s, country midwives also had high literacy rates which was remarkable considering female literacy was very low during this period.

===Modern history===

From the 18th century, a conflict between surgeons and midwives arose, as medical men began to assert that their modern scientific techniques were better for mothers and infants than the folk medicine practiced by midwives.
As doctors and medical associations pushed for a legal monopoly on obstetrical care, midwifery became outlawed or heavily regulated throughout the United States and Canada. In Northern Europe and Russia, the situation for midwives was a little easier - in the Duchy of Estonia in Imperial Russia, Professor Christian Friedrich Deutsch established a midwifery school for women at the University of Dorpat in 1811, which existed until World War I. It was the predecessor for the Tartu Health Care College. Training lasted for 7 months and in the end a certificate for practice was issued to the female students. Despite accusations that midwives were &quot;incompetent and ignorant&quot;, some argued that poorly trained surgeons were far more of a danger to pregnant women. In 1846, the physician Ignaz Semmelweiss observed that more women died in maternity wards staffed by male surgeons than by female midwives, and traced these outbreaks of puerperal fever back to (then all-male) medical students not washing their hands properly after dissecting cadavers, but his sanitary recommendations were ignored until acceptance of germ theory became widespread.

The argument that surgeons were more dangerous than midwives lasted until the study of bacteriology became popular in the early 1900s and hospital hygiene was improved. Women began to feel safer in the setting of the hospitals with the amount of aid and the ease of birth that they experienced with doctors. &quot;Physicians trained in the new century found a great contrast between their hospital and obstetrics practice in women&#x27;s homes where they could not maintain sterile conditions or have trained help.&quot; German social scientists Gunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger theorize that midwifery became a target of persecution and repression by public authorities because midwives possessed highly specialized knowledge and skills regarding not only assisting birth, but also contraception and abortion.

====Contemporary====
At late 20th century, midwives were already recognized as highly trained and specialized professionals in obstetrics. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, the medical perception of pregnancy and childbirth as potentially pathological and dangerous still dominates Western culture. Midwives who work in hospital settings also have been influenced by this view, although by and large they are trained to view birth as a normal and healthy process. While midwives play a much larger role in the care of pregnant mothers in Europe than in America, the medicalized model of birth still has influence in those countries, even though the World Health Organization recommends a natural, normal and humanized birth.

The midwifery model of pregnancy and childbirth as a normal and healthy process plays a much larger role in Sweden and the Netherlands than the rest of Europe, however. Swedish midwives stand out, since they administer 80 percent of prenatal care and more than 80 percent of family planning services in Sweden. Midwives in Sweden attend all normal births in public hospitals and Swedish women tend to have fewer interventions in hospitals than American women. The Dutch infant mortality rate is one of the lowest rate in the world, at 4.0 deaths per thousand births, while the United States ranked twenty-second. Midwives in the Netherlands and Sweden owe a great deal of their success to supportive government policies.

<text>Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra ( ; ; 29 September 1547 (assumed) – 22 April 1616 NS) was a Spanish writer widely regarded as the greatest writer in the Spanish language and one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent novelists. He is best known for his novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, a work considered as the first modern novel. The novel has been labelled by many well-known authors as the &quot;best book of all time&quot; and the &quot;best and most central work in world literature&quot;.

Much of his life was spent in relative poverty and obscurity, which led to many of his early works being lost. Despite this, his influence and literary contribution are reflected by the fact that Spanish is often referred to as &quot;the language of Cervantes&quot;.

In 1569, Cervantes was forced to leave Spain and move to Rome, where he worked in the household of a cardinal. In 1570, he enlisted in a Spanish Navy infantry regiment, and was badly wounded at the Battle of Lepanto in October 1571 and lost the use of his left arm and hand. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by Barbary pirates; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to Madrid.

His first significant novel, titled &quot;La Galatea&quot;, was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, and later as a government tax collector. Part One of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; was published in 1605, and Part Two in 1615. Other works include the 12 &quot;Novelas ejemplares&quot; (&quot;Exemplary Novels&quot;); a long poem, the &quot;Viaje del Parnaso&quot; (&quot;Journey to Parnassus&quot;); and &quot;Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses&quot; (&quot;Eight Plays and Eight s&quot;). The novel &quot;Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda&quot; (&quot;The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda&quot;), was published posthumously in 1616.

The cave of Medrano (also known as the casa de Medrano) in Argamasilla de Alba, which has been known since the beginning of the 17th century, and according to the tradition of Argamasilla de Alba, was the prison of Cervantes and the place where he conceived and began to write &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

==Biography==

Despite his subsequent renown, many details of Cervantes&#x27; life remain uncertain, including his name, background, and physical appearance. He signed his name as &quot;Cerbantes,&quot; but his printers used &quot;Cervantes,&quot; which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used &quot;Saavedra,&quot; the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual &quot;Cortinas,&quot; after his mother. Historian Luce López-Baralt has suggested that &quot;Saavedra&quot; comes from the Arabic dialect word &quot;shaibedraa&quot;, meaning &quot;one-handed,&quot; a reference to his nickname during his captivity. Further linguistic and historical evidence for this claim, however, remains debated.

Another area of dispute is his religious background. It has been suggested that not only Cervantes&#x27; father but also his mother may have been New Christians. Anthony Cascardi writes, &quot;While the family might have had some claim to nobility they often found themselves in financial straits. Moreover, they may have been of converso origin, that is, converts to Catholicism of Jewish ancestry. In the Spain of Cervantes&#x27; days, this meant living under clouds of official suspicion and social mistrust, with far more limited opportunities than were enjoyed by members of the &#x27;Old Christian&#x27; caste.&quot; According to Charles D. Presberg, however, there is no wide following for the view that Cervantes had converso origins. Cuban writer Roberto Echevarría argues that the claims of Cervantes&#x27; converso origins are based on &quot;very flimsy evidence&quot;, namely Cervantes&#x27; lack of social and financial progression which was not unusual for Spaniards of his time, regardless of their ancestry as many didn&#x27;t receive these rewards during this period.

It is generally accepted Miguel de Cervantes was born around 29 September 1547, in Alcalá de Henares. He was the second son of barber-surgeon Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (). Rodrigo came from Córdoba, Andalusia, where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.

===1547 to 1566: Early years===
Rodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from Arganda del Rey, and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with a keen eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.

Cervantes&#x27; siblings were Andrés (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in Córdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died. For reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will and the family disappears until 1564 when he filed a lawsuit in Seville.

Seville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is contended that Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from Córdoba. However, legal records show his father got into debt once more and in 1566 the family moved to Madrid.

===1566 to 1580: Military service and captivity===

In the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel. Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.

He eventually made his way to Rome, where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed Cardinal in 1570. When the 1570 to 1573 Ottoman–Venetian War began, Spain formed part of the Holy League, a coalition formed to support the Venetian Republic. Possibly seeing an opportunity to have his arrest warrant rescinded, Cervantes went to Naples, then part of the Crown of Aragon.

The military commander in Naples was Álvaro de Sande, a friend of the family, who gave Cervantes a commission in the Tercio of Sicily under the Marqués de Santa Cruz. At some point, he was joined in Naples by his younger brother Rodrigo. In September 1571, Cervantes sailed on board the &quot;Marquesa&quot;, part of the Holy League fleet under Don John of Austria, illegitimate half brother of Phillip II of Spain; on 7 October, they defeated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto.
 This landmark sea battle, the most significant naval conflict since the Roman Battle of Actium (32 B.C.), stopped Muslim incursion into Europe, and for the first time allowed European Christians to feel that they were not to be overrun by Islam.
According to his own account, although suffering from malaria, Cervantes was given command of a 12-man skiff, a small boat used for assaulting enemy galleys. The &quot;Marquesa&quot; lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless, this last wound is the reason why he later was called &quot;El manco de Lepanto&quot; (English: &quot;The one-handed man of Lepanto&quot;, &quot;The one-armed man of Lepanto&quot;), a title that followed him for the rest of his life. His actions at Lepanto were a source of pride to the end of his life, while Don John approved no less than four separate pay increases for him.

In &quot;Journey to Parnassus&quot;, published two years before his death in 1616, Cervantes claimed to have &quot;lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right&quot;. As with much else, the extent of his disability is unclear, the only source being Cervantes himself, while commentators cite his habitual tendency to praise himself. However, they were serious enough to earn him six months in the Civic Hospital at Messina, Sicily.

Although he returned to service in July 1572 in the &quot;Tercio de Figueroa&quot;, records show his chest wounds were still not completely healed in February 1573. Based mainly in Naples, he joined expeditions to Corfu and Navarino, and took part in the 1573 occupation of Tunis and La Goulette, which were recaptured by the Ottomans in 1574. Despite Lepanto, the war overall was an Ottoman victory, and the loss of Tunis a military disaster for Spain. Cervantes returned to Palermo, where he was paid off by the Duke of Sessa, who gave him letters of commendation.

In early September 1575, Cervantes and Rodrigo left Naples on the galley &quot;Sol&quot;; as they approached Barcelona on 26 September, their ship was captured by Ottoman corsairs, and the brothers taken to Algiers, to be sold as slaves, or – as was the case of Cervantes and his brother – held for ransom, if this would be more lucrative than their sale as slaves. Rodrigo was ransomed in 1577, but his family could not afford the fee for Cervantes, who was forced to remain. Turkish historian Rasih Nuri İleri found evidence suggesting Cervantes worked on the construction of the Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex, which would mean he spent at least part of his captivity in Istanbul. This is yet to be proven and no evidence has been published on the matter.

By 1580, Spain was occupied with integrating Portugal, and suppressing the Dutch Revolt, while the Ottomans were at war with Persia; the two sides agreed a truce, leading to an improvement of relations. After almost five years, and four escape attempts, in 1580 Cervantes was set free by the Trinitarians, a religious charity that specialised in ransoming Christian captives, and returned to Madrid.

===1580 to 1616: Later life and death===

While Cervantes was in captivity, both Don John and the Duke of Sessa died, depriving him of two potential patrons, while the Spanish economy was in dire straits. This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.

In April of that year, Cervantes visited Esquivias, to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro Laínez. There he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old. The first use of the name &quot;Cervantes Saavedra&quot; appears in 1586, on documents related to their marriage.

Shortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November. Her mother, Ana Franca, was the wife of a Madrid innkeeper; they apparently concealed it from her husband, but Cervantes acknowledged paternity. When Ana Franca died in 1598, he asked his sister Magdalena to take care of his daughter.

In 1587, Cervantes was appointed as a government purchasing agent, &quot;Commissary of the Royal Galleons&quot; in Seville, obtaining wheat and oil for the doomed Spanish Armada. He became a tax collector in 1592 and was briefly jailed for &#x27;irregularities&#x27; in his accounts, but quickly released. Several applications for positions in Spanish America were rejected i.e. to the Council of Indies in 1590, though modern critics note images of the colonies appear in his work.

From 1596 to 1600, he lived primarily in Seville, then returned to Madrid in 1606, where he remained for the rest of his life. In later years, he received some financial support from the Count of Lemos, although he was not included in the retinue Lemos took to Naples when appointed Viceroy in 1608. In July 1613, he joined the Third Order Franciscans, then a common way for Catholics to gain spiritual merit. It is generally accepted Cervantes died on 22 April 1616 (NS; the Gregorian calendar had superseded the Julian in 1582 in Spain and some other countries); the symptoms described, including intense thirst, correspond to diabetes, then untreatable.

In accordance with his will, Cervantes was buried in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians, in central Madrid. His remains went missing when moved during rebuilding work at the convent in 1673, and in 2014, historian Fernando de Prado launched a project to rediscover them.

In January 2015, Francisco Etxeberria, the forensic anthropologist leading the search, reported the discovery of caskets containing bone fragments, and part of a board, with the letters &#x27;M.C.&#x27;. Based on evidence of injuries suffered at Lepanto, on 17 March 2015 they were confirmed as belonging to Cervantes along with his wife and others. They were formally reburied at a public ceremony in June 2015.

==Supposed likenesses==
No authenticated portrait of Cervantes is known to exist. The one most often associated with the author is attributed to Juan de Jáuregui, but both names were added at a later date. The El Greco painting in the , known as &quot;Retrato de un caballero desconocido&quot; (&quot;Portrait of an Unknown Gentleman&quot;), is cited as &#x27;possibly&#x27; depicting Cervantes, but there is no evidence for this. It has been suggested that the portrait &quot;The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest&quot;, also by El Greco, may possibly depict Cervantes. 

However, The Prado itself, while mentioning, in passing, that &quot;specific names have been proposed for the sitter, including that of Cervantes&quot;, and even &quot;that the painting could be a self-portrait [of El Greco]&quot;, goes on to state that &quot;Without doubt, the most convincing suggestion has connected this figure with the Second Marquis of Montemayor, Juan de Silva y de Ribera, a contemporary of El Greco who was appointed military commander of the Alcázar in Toledo by Philip II and Chief Notary to the Crown, a position that would explain the solemn gesture of the hand, depicted in the act of taking an oath.&quot;

The portrait by Luis de Madrazo, at the , painted in 1859, was based on his imagination. The image that appears on Spanish euro coins of €0.10, €0.20 and €0.50 is based on a bust, created in 1905.

==Literary career and legacy==

Cervantes claimed to have written over 20 plays, such as &quot;El trato de Argel&quot;, based on his experiences in captivity. Such works were extremely short-lived, and even Lope de Vega, the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds. In 1585, he published &quot;La Galatea&quot;, a conventional pastoral romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.

Aside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine &#x27;vain and empty&#x27; chivalric romances. His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of Philip IV on 8 April.

He finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, &quot;Novelas ejemplares&quot;, dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; in 1615.

The two parts of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose and their realism. The first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal. The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.

In addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled &quot;Exemplary Novels&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Viaje del Parnaso&quot;, &quot;Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes&quot;, and &quot;Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda&quot;, completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.

Cervantes also possessed a unique writing style, often blending elements of comedic themes to more complex adult-oriented undertones, best displayed by Don Quixote. 

&quot;In the space of a few pages, what started as an exercise in comic ridicule and, as the narrator insists on several occasions, a satirical send-up of the tales of chivalry, has taken on an entirely different dimension; it has begun to transform itself into the story of a relationship between two characters whose incompatible takes on the world are bridged by friendship, loyalty, and eventually love.&quot;

Cervantes was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century. The literary editor John Bowle argued that Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure. However, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author Carlos Fuentes suggested that Cervantes and his contemporary William Shakespeare form part of a narrative tradition that includes Homer, Dante, Defoe, Dickens, Balzac, and Joyce.

Sigmund Freud claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired &quot;The Dialogue of the Dogs&quot; (&quot;El coloquio de los perros&quot;), from &quot;Exemplary Tales&quot;, in which two dogs, Cipión and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, Freud and his close friend Eduard Silberstein wrote letters to each other, using the pen names Cipión and Berganza.

In 1905, the tricentennial of the publication of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of &quot;Cervantina&quot;, a celebration of his plays by the Compañía Nacional de Teatro Clásico in Madrid. &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, the 1965 musical, was loosely based on Cervantes&#x27; life. The Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library, is the world&#x27;s largest digital archive of Spanish-language historical and literary works.

===Other works===

Cervantes is generally considered a mediocre poet; few of his poems survive. Some appear in &quot;La Galatea&quot;, while he also wrote &quot;Dos Canciones à la Armada Invencible&quot;.

His sonnets include &quot;Al Túmulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla&quot;, &quot;Canto de Calíope&quot; and &quot;Epístola a Mateo Vázquez&quot;. &quot;Viaje del Parnaso&quot;, or &quot;Journey to Parnassus&quot;, is his most ambitious verse work, an allegory that consists largely of reviews of contemporary poets.

He published a number of dramatic works, including ten extant full-length plays:
* &quot;Trato de Argel&quot;; based on his own experiences, deals with the life of Christian slaves in Algiers;
* &quot;La Numancia&quot;; intended as a patriotic work, dramatization of the long and brutal siege of Numantia, by Scipio Aemilianus, completing the transformation of the Iberian Peninsula into the Roman province Hispania, or España.
* &quot;El gallardo español&quot;,
* &quot;Los baños de Argel&quot;,
* &quot;La gran sultana, Doña Catalina de Oviedo&quot;,
* &quot;La casa de los celos&quot;,
* &quot;El laberinto de amor&quot;,
* &quot;La entretenida&quot;,
* &quot;El rufián dichoso&quot;,
* &quot;Pedro de Urdemalas&quot;, a sensitive play about a &quot;picaro&quot;, who joins a group of Gypsies for love of a girl.

He also wrote eight short farces (&quot;entremeses&quot;):
* &quot;El juez de los divorcios&quot;,
* &quot;El rufián viudo llamado Trampagos&quot;,
* &quot;La elección de los Alcaldes de Daganzo&quot;,
* &quot;La guarda cuidadosa&quot; (The Vigilant Sentinel),
* &quot;El vizcaíno fingido&quot;,
* &quot;El retablo de las maravillas&quot;,
* &quot;La cueva de Salamanca&quot;
* &quot;El viejo celoso&quot; (The Jealous Old Man).

These plays and short farces, except for &quot;Trato de Argel&quot; and &quot;La Numancia&quot;, made up &quot;Ocho Comedias y ocho entreméses nuevos, nunca representados&quot; (&quot;Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes, Never Before Performed&quot;), which appeared in 1615. The dates and order of composition of Cervantes&#x27;s short farces are unknown. Faithful to the spirit of Lope de Rueda, Cervantes endowed them with novelistic elements, such as simplified plot, the type of descriptions normally associated with a novel, and character development. Cervantes included some of his dramas among the works he was most satisfied with.

<text>Moses ben Maimon (1138–1204), commonly known as Maimonides (, ) and also referred to by the Hebrew acronym Rambam (), was a Sephardic rabbi and philosopher who became one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars of the Middle Ages. In his time, he was also a preeminent astronomer and physician, serving as the personal physician of Saladin. He was born on Passover eve 1138 or 1135, and lived in Córdoba in al-Andalus (now in Spain) within the Almoravid Empire until his family was expelled for refusing to convert to Islam. Later, he lived in Morocco and Egypt and worked as a rabbi, physician and philosopher.

During his lifetime, most Jews greeted Maimonides&#x27; writings on Jewish law and ethics with acclaim and gratitude, even as far away as Iraq and Yemen. Yet, while Maimonides rose to become the revered head of the Jewish community in Egypt, his writings also had vociferous critics, particularly in Spain. He died in Fustat, Egypt, and, according to Jewish tradition, was buried in Tiberias. His tomb in Tiberias is a popular pilgrimage and tourist site.

He was posthumously acknowledged as one of the foremost rabbinic decisors and philosophers in Jewish history, and his copious work comprises a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. His fourteen-volume still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of &quot;halakha&quot;.

Aside from being revered by Jewish historians, Maimonides also figures very prominently in the history of Islamic and Arab sciences. Influenced by Aristotle, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and his contemporary Ibn Rushd, he became a prominent philosopher and polymath in both the Jewish and Islamic worlds.

==Name==
Maimonides referred to himself as &quot;Moses, son of Rabbi Maimon the Spaniard&quot; (). In Medieval Hebrew, he was usually called , short for &quot;our Rabbi Moshe&quot;, but mostly he is called , short for &quot;our Rabbi, Moshe son of Maimon&quot; and pronounced &quot;Rambam&quot;.

In Arabic, he is sometimes called &quot;Moses &#x27;son of Amram&#x27; son of Maimon, of Obadiah, the Cordoban&quot; (, &quot;Abū ʿImrān Mūsā bin Maimūn bin ʿUbaydallāh al-Qurṭubī&quot;), or more often simply &quot;Moses, son of Maimon&quot; ().

In Greek, the Hebrew (&#x27;son of&#x27;) becomes the patronymic suffix &quot;&quot;, forming Μωησής Μαϊμονίδης &quot;Moses Maimonides&quot;.

He is sometimes known as &quot;The Great Eagle&quot; ().

==Biography==
===Early years===

Maimonides was born 1138 (or 1135) in Córdoba in the Muslim-ruled Almoravid Caliphate, at the end of the golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula after the first centuries of Muslim rule. His father, Maimon ben Joseph, was a dayyan or rabbinic judge. Aaron ben Jacob ha-Kohen later wrote that he had traced Maimonides&#x27; descent back to Simeon ben Judah ha-Nasi from the Davidic line. His ancestry, going back four generations, is given in his &quot;Epistle to Yemen&quot; as Moses son of Maimon the Judge, son of Joseph the Wise, son of Isaac the Rabbi, son of Obadiah the Judge. At the end of his commentary on the Mishnah, however, a longer, slightly different genealogy is given: Moses son of Maimon the Judge, son of Joseph the Wise, son of Isaac the Judge, son of Joseph the Judge, son of Obadiah the Judge, son of Solomon the Rabbi, son of Obadiah the Judge.

Maimonides studied Torah under his father, who had in turn studied under Joseph ibn Migash, a student of Isaac Alfasi. At an early age, Maimonides developed an interest in sciences and philosophy. He read ancient Greek philosophy accessible via Arabic translations and was deeply immersed in the sciences and learning of Islamic culture.

Maimonides, who was revered for his personality as well as for his writings, led a busy life, and wrote many of his works while travelling or in temporary accommodation.

===Exile===

A Berber dynasty, the Almohads, conquered Córdoba in 1148 and abolished status (i.e., state protection of non-Muslims ensured through payment of a tax, the ) in some of their territories. The loss of this status forced the Jewish and Christian communities to choose between conversion to Islam, death, or exile. Many Jews were forced to convert, but due to suspicion by the authorities of fake conversions, the new converts had to wear identifying clothing that set them apart and made them subject to public scrutiny.

Maimonides&#x27; family, along with many other Jews, chose exile. For the next ten years, Maimonides moved about in southern Spain and North Africa, eventually settling in Fez, Morocco. Some say that his teacher in Fez was Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Cohen Ibn Susan, until the latter was killed in 1165.

During this time, he composed his acclaimed commentary on the Mishnah, during the years 1166–1168.

Following this sojourn in Morocco, he lived in Acre with his father and brother, before settling in Fustat in Fatimid Caliphate-controlled Egypt by 1168. There is mention that Maimonides first settled in Alexandria, and moved to Fustat only in 1171. While in Cairo, he studied in a yeshiva attached to a small synagogue, which now bears his name. In Jerusalem, he prayed at the Temple Mount. He wrote that this day of visiting the Temple Mount was a day of holiness for him and his descendants.

Maimonides shortly thereafter was instrumental in helping rescue Jews taken captive during the Christian Amalric of Jerusalem&#x27;s siege of the southeastern Nile Delta town of Bilbeis. He sent five letters to the Jewish communities of Lower Egypt asking them to pool money together to pay the ransom. The money was collected and then given to two judges sent to Palestine to negotiate with the Crusaders. The captives were eventually released.

===Death of his brother===

Following this success, the Maimonides family, hoping to increase their wealth, gave their savings to his brother, the youngest son David ben Maimon, a merchant. Maimonides directed his brother to procure goods only at the Sudanese port of ʿAydhab. After a long, arduous trip through the desert, however, David was unimpressed by the goods on offer there. Against his brother&#x27;s wishes, David boarded a ship for India, since great wealth was to be found in the East. Before he could reach his destination, David drowned at sea sometime between 1169 and 1177. The death of his brother caused Maimonides to become sick with grief.

In a letter discovered in the Cairo Geniza, he wrote:

===Nagid===

Around 1171, Maimonides was appointed the of the Egyptian Jewish community. Arabist Shelomo Dov Goitein believes the leadership he displayed during the ransoming of the Crusader captives led to this appointment. However he was replaced by Sar Shalom ben Moses in 1173. Over the controversial course of Sar Shalom&#x27;s appointment, during which Sar Shalom was accused of tax farming, Maimonides excommunicated and fought with him for several years until Maimonides was appointed Nagid in 1195. A work known as &quot;Megillat Zutta&quot; was written by Abraham ben Hillel, who writes a scathing description of Sar Shalom while praising Maimonides as &quot;the light of east and west and unique master and marvel of the generation.&quot;

===Physician===

With the loss of the family funds tied up in David&#x27;s business venture, Maimonides assumed the vocation of physician, for which he was to become famous. He had trained in medicine in both Spain and in Fez. Gaining widespread recognition, he was appointed court physician to al-Qadi al-Fadil, the chief secretary to Sultan Saladin, then to Saladin himself; after whose death he remained a physician to the Ayyubid dynasty.

In his medical writings, Maimonides described many conditions, including asthma, diabetes, hepatitis, and pneumonia, and he emphasized moderation and a healthy lifestyle. His treatises became influential for generations of physicians. He was knowledgeable about Greek and Arabic medicine, and followed the principles of humorism in the tradition of Galen. He did not blindly accept authority but used his own observation and experience. Julia Bess Frank indicates that Maimonides in his medical writings sought to interpret works of authorities so that they could become acceptable. Maimonides displayed in his interactions with patients attributes that today would be called intercultural awareness and respect for the patient&#x27;s autonomy. Although he frequently wrote of his longing for solitude in order to come closer to God and to extend his reflections—elements considered essential in his philosophy to the prophetic experience—he gave over most of his time to caring for others. In a famous letter, Maimonides describes his daily routine. After visiting the Sultan&#x27;s palace, he would arrive home exhausted and hungry, where &quot;I would find the antechambers filled with gentiles and Jews [...] I would go to heal them, and write prescriptions for their illnesses [...] until the evening [...] and I would be extremely weak.&quot;

As he goes on to say in this letter, even on Shabbat he would receive members of the community. Still, he managed to write extended treatises, including not only medical and other scientific studies but some of the most systematically thought-through and influential treatises on halakha (rabbinic law) and Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages.

In 1172–74, Maimonides wrote his famous &quot;Epistle to Yemen&quot;. It has been suggested that his &quot;incessant travail&quot; undermined his own health and brought about his death at 69 (although this is a normal lifespan).

===Death===

Maimonides died on 12 December 1204 (20th of Tevet 4965) in Fustat. A variety of medieval sources beginning with Al-Qifti maintain that his body was interred near Lake Tiberias, though there is no contemporary evidence for his removal from Egypt. Gedaliah ibn Yahya records that &quot;He was buried in the Upper Galilee with elegies upon his gravestone. In the time of [David] Kimhi, when the sons of Belial rose up to besmirch [Maimonides] . . . they did evil. They altered his gravestone, which previously had been inscribed &#x27;choicest of the human race (מבחר המין האנושי)&#x27;, so that instead it read &#x27;the excommunicated heretic (מוחרם ומין)&#x27;. But later, after the provocateurs had repented of their act, and praised this great man, a student repaired the gravestone to read &#x27;choicest of the Israelites (מבחר המין הישראלי)&#x27;&quot;. Today, Tiberias hosts the Tomb of Maimonides, on which is inscribed &quot;From Moses to Moses arose none like Moses.&quot;

Maimonides and his wife, the daughter of Mishael ben Yeshayahu Halevi, had one child who survived into adulthood, Abraham Maimonides, who became recognized as a great scholar. He succeeded Maimonides as Nagid and as court physician at the age of eighteen. Throughout his career, he defended his father&#x27;s writings against all critics. The office of Nagid was held by the Maimonides family for four successive generations until the end of the 14th century.

A statue of Maimonides was erected near the Córdoba Synagogue.

Maimonides is sometimes said to be a descendant of King David, although he never made such a claim.

==Works==
===Mishneh Torah===

With , Maimonides composed a code of Jewish law with the widest-possible scope and depth. The work gathers all the binding laws from the Talmud, and incorporates the positions of the Geonim (post-Talmudic early medieval scholars, mainly from Mesopotamia). It is also known as or simply () which has the numerical value 14, representing the 14 books of the work. The &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; made following Jewish law easier for the Jews of his time, who were struggling to understand the complex nature of Jewish rules and regulations as they had adapted over the years.

Later codes of Jewish law, e.g. Arba&#x27;ah Turim by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher and Shulchan Aruch by Rabbi Yosef Karo, draw heavily on : both often quote whole sections verbatim. However, it met initially with much opposition. There were two main reasons for this opposition. First, Maimonides had refrained from adding references to his work for the sake of brevity; second, in the introduction, he gave the impression of wanting to &quot;cut out&quot; study of the Talmud, to arrive at a conclusion in Jewish law, although Maimonides later wrote that this was not his intent. His most forceful opponents were the rabbis of Provence (Southern France), and a running critique by Rabbi Abraham ben David (Raavad III) is printed in virtually all editions of . Nevertheless, Mishneh Torah was recognized as a monumental contribution to the systemized writing of halakha. Throughout the centuries, it has been widely studied and its halakhic decisions have weighed heavily in later rulings.

In response to those who would attempt to force followers of Maimonides and his to abide by the rulings of his own Shulchan Aruch or other later works, Rabbi Yosef Karo wrote: &quot;Who would dare force communities who follow the Rambam to follow any other decisor [of Jewish law], early or late? [...] The Rambam is the greatest of the decisors, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the Arabistan and the Maghreb practice according to his word, and accepted him as their rabbi.&quot;

An oft-cited legal maxim from his pen is: &quot;It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.&quot; He argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until defendants would be convicted merely according to the judge&#x27;s caprice.

===Other Judaic and philosophical works===
Maimonides composed works of Jewish scholarship, rabbinic law, philosophy, and medical texts. Most of Maimonides&#x27; works were written in Judeo-Arabic. However, the was written in Hebrew. In addition to Mishneh Torah, his Jewish texts were:
* &quot;Commentary on the Mishna&quot; (Arabic , translated into Hebrew as ), written in Classical Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet. This was the first full commentary ever written on the entire Mishnah, which took Maimonides seven years to complete. It is considered one of the most important Mishnah commentaries, having enjoyed great popularity both in its Arabic original and its medieval Hebrew translation. The commentary includes three philosophical introductions which were also highly influential:
** The Introduction to the Mishnah deals with the nature of the oral law, the distinction between the prophet and the sage, and the organizational structure of the Mishnah.
** The Introduction to Mishnah Sanhedrin, chapter ten (), is an eschatological essay that concludes with Maimonides&#x27; famous creed (&quot;the thirteen principles of faith&quot;).
** The Introduction to Pirkei Avot, popularly called &quot;The Eight Chapters&quot;, is an ethical treatise.
* (&quot;The Book of Commandments&quot;). In this work, Maimonides lists all the 613 mitzvot traditionally contained in the Torah (Pentateuch). He describes fourteen (roots or principles) to guide his selection.
* (&quot;Letter of Martydom&quot;)
* &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, a philosophical work harmonising and differentiating Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy and Jewish theology. Written in Judeo-Arabic under the title , and completed between 1186 and 1190. It has been suggested that the title is derived from the Arabic phrase &quot;dalīl al-mutaḥayyirin&quot; (guide of the perplexed) a name for God in a work by al-Ghazālī, echoes of whose work can be found elsewhere in Maimonides. The first translation of this work into Hebrew was done by Samuel ibn Tibbon in 1204 just prior to Maimonides&#x27; death.
* , collected correspondence and responsa, including a number of public letters (on resurrection and the afterlife, on conversion to other faiths, and —addressed to the oppressed Jewry of Yemen).
* , a fragment of a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud, identified and published by Saul Lieberman in 1947.
* Commentaries to the Babylonian Talmud, of which fragments survive.

===Medical works===
Maimonides&#x27; achievements in the medical field are well known, and are cited by many medieval authors. One of his more important medical works is his &quot;Guide to Good Health&quot; (), which he composed in Arabic for the Sultan al-Afdal, son of Saladin, who suffered from depression. The work was translated into Latin, and published in Florence in 1477, becoming the first medical book to appear in print there. While his prescriptions may have become obsolete, &quot;his ideas about preventive medicine, public hygiene, approach to the suffering patient, and the preservation of the health of the soul have not become obsolete.&quot; Maimonides wrote ten known medical works in Arabic that have been translated by the Jewish medical ethicist Fred Rosner into contemporary English. Lectures, conferences and research on Maimonides, even recently in the 21st century, have been done at medical universities in Morocco.
*, Suessmann Muntner (ed.), Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963 (translated into Hebrew by Moshe Ibn Tibbon) ()
* &quot;The Art of Cure – Extracts from Galen&quot; (Barzel, 1992, Vol. 5) is essentially an extract of Galen&#x27;s extensive writings.
* &quot;Commentary on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates&quot; (Rosner, 1987, Vol. 2; Hebrew: ) is interspersed with his own views.
* &quot;Medical Aphorisms of Moses&quot; (Rosner, 1989, Vol. 3) titled &quot;Fusul Musa&quot; in Arabic (&quot;Chapters of Moses&quot;, Hebrew: ) contains 1500 aphorisms and many medical conditions are described.
* &quot;Treatise on Hemorrhoids&quot; (in Rosner, 1984, Vol. 1; Hebrew: ) discusses also digestion and food.
* &quot;Treatise on Cohabitation&quot; (in Rosner, 1984, Vol. 1) contains recipes as aphrodisiacs and anti-aphrodisiacs.
* &quot;Treatise on Asthma&quot; (Rosner, 1994, Vol. 6) discusses climates and diets and their effect on asthma and emphasizes the need for clean air.
* &quot;Treatise on Poisons and Their Antidotes&quot; (in Rosner, 1984, Vol. 1) is an early toxicology textbook that remained popular for centuries.
* &quot;Regimen of Health&quot; (in Rosner, 1990, Vol. 4; Hebrew: ) is a discourse on healthy living and the mind-body connection.
* &quot;Discourse on the Explanation of Fits&quot; advocates healthy living and the avoidance of overabundance.
* &quot;Glossary of Drug Names&quot; (Rosner, 1992, Vol. 7) represents a pharmacopeia with 405 paragraphs with the names of drugs in Arabic, Greek, Syrian, Persian, Berber, and Spanish.

====&quot;The Oath of Maimonides&quot;====
The &quot;Oath of Maimonides&quot; is a document about the medical calling and recited as a substitute for the &quot;Hippocratic Oath&quot;. It is not to be confused with a more lengthy &quot;Prayer of Maimonides&quot;. These documents may not have been written by Maimonides, but later. The &quot;Prayer&quot; appeared first in print in 1793 and has been attributed to Markus Herz, a German physician, pupil of Immanuel Kant.

===Treatise on logic===
The &quot;Treatise on Logic&quot; (Arabic: ) has been printed 17 times, including editions in Latin (1527), German (1805, 1822, 1833, 1828), French (1936) by Moïse Ventura and in 1996 by Rémi Brague, and English (1938) by Israel Efros, and in an abridged Hebrew form. The work illustrates the essentials of Aristotelian logic to be found in the teachings of the great Islamic philosophers such as Avicenna and, above all, Al-Farabi, &quot;the Second Master,&quot; the &quot;First Master&quot; being Aristotle. In his work devoted to the Treatise, Rémi Brague stresses the fact that Al-Farabi is the only philosopher mentioned therein. This indicates a line of conduct for the reader, who must read the text keeping in mind Al-Farabi&#x27;s works on logic. In the Hebrew versions, the Treatise is called &quot;The words of Logic&quot; which describes the bulk of the work. The author explains the technical meaning of the words used by logicians. The Treatise duly inventories the terms used by the logician and indicates what they refer to. The work proceeds rationally through a lexicon of philosophical terms to a summary of higher philosophical topics, in 14 chapters corresponding to Maimonides&#x27; birthdate of 14 Nissan. The number 14 recurs in many of Maimonides&#x27; works. Each chapter offers a cluster of associated notions. The meaning of the words is explained and illustrated with examples. At the end of each chapter, the author carefully draws up the list of words studied.

Until very recently, it was accepted that Maimonides wrote the &quot;Treatise on Logic&quot; in his twenties or even in his teen years. Herbert Davidson has raised questions about Maimonides&#x27; authorship of this short work (and of other short works traditionally attributed to Maimonides). He maintains that Maimonides was not the author at all, based on a report of two Arabic-language manuscripts, unavailable to Western investigators in Asia Minor. Rabbi Yosef Kafih maintained that it is by Maimonides and newly translated it to Hebrew (as ) from the Judeo-Arabic.

==Philosophy==

Through &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; and the philosophical introductions to sections of his commentaries on the Mishna, Maimonides exerted an important influence on the Scholastic philosophers, especially on Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. He was a Jewish Scholastic. Educated more by reading the works of Arab Muslim philosophers than by personal contact with Arabian teachers, he acquired an intimate acquaintance not only with Arab Muslim philosophy, but with the doctrines of Aristotle. Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelianism and science with the teachings of the Torah. In his &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, he often explains the function and purpose of the statutory provisions contained in the Torah against the backdrop of the historical conditions. The book was highly controversial in its day, and was banned by French rabbis, who burnt copies of the work in Montpellier.

===Thirteen principles of faith===
In his commentary on the Mishnah (Tractate Sanhedrin, chapter 10), Maimonides formulates his &quot;13 principles of faith&quot;; and that these principles summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of Judaism:
# The existence of God.
# God&#x27;s unity and indivisibility into elements.
# God&#x27;s spirituality and incorporeality.
# God&#x27;s eternity.
# God alone should be the object of worship.
# Revelation through God&#x27;s prophets.
# The preeminence of Moses among the prophets.
# That the entire Torah (both the Written and Oral law) are of Divine origin and were dictated to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai.
# The Torah given by Moses is permanent and will not be replaced or changed.
# God&#x27;s awareness of all human actions and thoughts.
# Reward of righteousness and punishment of evil.
# The coming of the Jewish Messiah.
# The resurrection of the dead.

Maimonides is said to have compiled the principles from various Talmudic sources. These principles were controversial when first proposed, evoking criticism by Rabbis Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo, and were effectively ignored by much of the Jewish community for the next few centuries. However, these principles have become widely held and are considered to be the cardinal principles of faith for Orthodox Jews. Two poetic restatements of these principles ( and ) eventually became canonized in many editions of the Siddur (Jewish prayer book).

The omission of a list of these principles as such within his later works, the and &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, has led some to suggest that either he retracted his earlier position, or that these principles are descriptive rather than prescriptive.

===Theology===

Maimonides equated the God of Abraham to what philosophers refer to as the Necessary Being. God is unique in the universe, and the Torah commands that one love and fear God (Deut 10:12) on account of that uniqueness. To Maimonides, this meant that one ought to contemplate God&#x27;s works and to marvel at the order and wisdom that went into their creation. When one does this, one inevitably comes to love God and to sense how insignificant one is in comparison to God. This is the basis of the Torah.

The principle that inspired his philosophical activity was identical to a fundamental tenet of scholasticism: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human mind in science and philosophy. Maimonides primarily relied upon the science of Aristotle and the teachings of the Talmud, commonly claiming to find a basis for the latter in the former.

Maimonides&#x27; admiration for the Neoplatonic commentators led him to doctrines which the later Scholastics did not accept. For instance, Maimonides was an adherent of apophatic theology. In this theology, one attempts to describe God through negative attributes. For example, one should not say that God exists in the usual sense of the term; it can be said that God is not non-existent. One should not say that &quot;God is wise&quot;; but it can be said that &quot;God is not ignorant,&quot; i.e., in some way, God has some properties of knowledge. One should not say that &quot;God is One,&quot; but it can be stated that &quot;there is no multiplicity in God&#x27;s being.&quot; In brief, the attempt is to gain and express knowledge of God by describing what God is not, rather than by describing what God &quot;is.&quot;

Maimonides argued adamantly that God is not corporeal. This was central to his thinking about the sin of idolatry. Maimonides insisted that all of the anthropomorphic phrases pertaining to God in sacred texts are to be interpreted metaphorically. A related tenet of Maimonidean theology is the notion that the commandments, especially those pertaining to sacrifices, are intended to help wean the Israelites away from idolatry.

Maimonides also argued that God embodied reason, intellect, science, and nature, and was omnipotent and indescribable. He said that science, the growth of scientific fields, and discovery of the unknown by comprehension of nature was a way to appreciate God.

===Character development===
Maimonides taught about the developing of one&#x27;s moral character. Although his life predated the modern concept of a personality, Maimonides believed that each person has an innate disposition along an ethical and emotional spectrum. Although one&#x27;s disposition is often determined by factors outside of one&#x27;s control, human beings have free will to choose to behave in ways that build character. He wrote, &quot;One is obligated to conduct his affairs with others in a gentle and pleasing manner.&quot; Maimonides advised that those with antisocial character traits should identify those traits and then make a conscious effort to behave in the opposite way. For example, an arrogant person should practice humility. If the circumstances of one&#x27;s environment are such that it is impossible to behave ethically, one must move to a new location.

===Prophecy===
Maimonides agreed with &quot;the Philosopher&quot; (Aristotle) that the use of logic is the &quot;right&quot; way of thinking. He claimed that in order to understand how to know God, every human being must, by study, and meditation attain the degree of perfection required to reach the prophetic state. Despite his rationalistic approach, he does not explicitly reject the previous ideas (as portrayed, for example, by Rabbi Yehuda Halevi in his ) that in order to become a prophet, God must intervene. Maimonides teaches that prophecy is the highest purpose of the most learned and refined individuals.

===The problem of evil===
Maimonides wrote on theodicy (the philosophical attempt to reconcile the existence of a God with the existence of evil). He took the premise that an omnipotent and good God exists. In &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, Maimonides writes that all the evil that exists within human beings stems from their individual attributes, while all good comes from a universally shared humanity (Guide 3:8). He says that there are people who are guided by higher purpose, and there are those who are guided by physicality and must strive to find the higher purpose with which to guide their actions.

To justify the existence of evil, assuming God is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, Maimonides postulates that one who created something by causing its opposite not to exist is not the same as creating something that exists; so evil is merely the absence of good. God did not create evil, rather God created good, and evil exists where good is absent (Guide 3:10). Therefore, all good is divine invention, and evil both is not and comes secondarily.

Maimonides contests the common view that evil outweighs good in the world. He says that if one were to examine existence only in terms of humanity, then that person may observe evil to dominate good, but if one looks at the whole of the universe, then he sees good is significantly more common than evil (Guide 3:12). Man, he reasons, is too insignificant a figure in God&#x27;s myriad works to be their primary characterizing force, and so when people see mostly evil in their lives, they are not taking into account the extent of positive Creation outside of themselves.

Maimonides believes that there are three types of evil in the world: evil caused by nature, evil that people bring upon others, and evil man brings upon himself (Guide 3:12). The first type of evil Maimonides states is the rarest form, but arguably of the most necessary—the balance of life and death in both the human and animal worlds itself, he recognizes, is essential to God&#x27;s plan. Maimonides writes that the second type of evil is relatively rare, and that humanity brings it upon itself. The third type of evil humans bring upon themselves and is the source of most of the ills of the world. These are the result of people&#x27;s falling victim to their physical desires. To prevent the majority of evil which stems from harm one does to oneself, one must learn how to respond to one&#x27;s bodily urges.

===Skepticism of astrology===

Maimonides answered an inquiry concerning astrology, addressed to him from Marseille. He responded that man should believe only what can be supported either by rational proof, by the evidence of the senses, or by trustworthy authority. He affirms that he had studied astrology, and that it does not deserve to be described as a science. He ridicules the concept that the fate of a man could be dependent upon the constellations; he argues that such a theory would rob life of purpose, and would make man a slave of destiny.

===True beliefs versus necessary beliefs===
In &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; Book III, Chapter 28, Maimonides draws a distinction between &quot;true beliefs,&quot; which were beliefs about God that produced intellectual perfection, and &quot;necessary beliefs,&quot; which were conducive to improving social order. Maimonides places anthropomorphic personification statements about God in the latter class. He uses as an example the notion that God becomes &quot;angry&quot; with people who do wrong. In the view of Maimonides (taken from Avicenna), God does not become angry with people, as God has no human passions; but it is important for them to believe God does, so that they desist from doing wrong.

=== Righteousness and charity ===

Maimonides conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of tzedakah, where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient instead of living upon others. In his view, the lowest form of &quot;tzedakah&quot; is to give begrudgingly. The eight levels are:
# Giving begrudgingly
# Giving less than you should, but giving it cheerfully
# Giving after being asked
# Giving before being asked
# Giving when you do not know the recipient&#x27;s identity, but the recipient knows your identity
# Giving when you know the recipient&#x27;s identity, but the recipient doesn&#x27;t know your identity
# Giving when neither party knows the other&#x27;s identity
# Enabling the recipient to become self-reliant

===Eschatology===
====The Messianic era====
Perhaps one of Maimonides&#x27; most highly acclaimed and renowned writings is his treatise on the Messianic era, written originally in Judeo-Arabic and which he elaborates on in great detail in his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to the 10th chapter of tractate Sanhedrin, also known as ).

====Resurrection====

Religious Jews believed in immortality in a spiritual sense, and most believed that the future would include a messianic era and a resurrection of the dead. This is the subject of Jewish eschatology. Maimonides wrote much on this topic, but in most cases he wrote about the immortality of the soul for people of perfected intellect; his writings were usually about the resurrection of dead bodies. Rabbis of his day were critical of this aspect of this thought, and there was controversy over his true views.

Eventually, Maimonides felt pressured to write a treatise on the subject, known as &quot;The Treatise on Resurrection.&quot; In it, he wrote that those who claimed that he believed the verses of the Hebrew Bible referring to the resurrection were only allegorical were spreading falsehoods. Maimonides asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of Judaism about which there is no disagreement.

While his position on the World to Come (non-corporeal eternal life as described above) may be seen as being in contradiction with his position on bodily resurrection, Maimonides resolved them with a then unique solution: Maimonides believed that the resurrection was not permanent or general. In his view, God never violates the laws of nature. Rather, divine interaction is by way of angels, whom Maimonides often regards to be metaphors for the laws of nature, the principles by which the physical universe operates, or Platonic eternal forms. Thus, if a unique event actually occurs, even if it is perceived as a miracle, it is not a violation of the world&#x27;s order.

In this view, any dead who are resurrected must eventually die again. In his discussion of the 13 principles of faith, the first five deal with knowledge of God, the next four deal with prophecy and the Torah, while the last four deal with reward, punishment and the ultimate redemption. In this discussion Maimonides says nothing of a universal resurrection. All he says it is that whatever resurrection does take place, it will occur at an indeterminate time before the world to come, which he repeatedly states will be purely spiritual.

====The World to Come====
Maimonides distinguishes two kinds of intelligence in man, the one material in the sense of being dependent on, and influenced by, the body, and the other immaterial, that is, independent of the bodily organism. The latter is a direct emanation from the universal active intellect; this is his interpretation of the of Aristotelian philosophy. It is acquired as the result of the efforts of the soul to attain a correct knowledge of the absolute, pure intelligence of God.

The knowledge of God is a form of knowledge which develops in us the immaterial intelligence, and thus confers on man an immaterial, spiritual nature. This confers on the soul that perfection in which human happiness consists, and endows the soul with immortality. One who has attained a correct knowledge of God has reached a condition of existence, which renders him immune from all the accidents of fortune, from all the allurements of sin, and from death itself. Man is in a position to work out his own salvation and his immortality.

Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s doctrine of immortality was strikingly similar. However, Spinoza teaches that the way to attain the knowledge which confers immortality is the progress from sense-knowledge through scientific knowledge to philosophical intuition of all things , while Maimonides holds that the road to perfection and immortality is the path of duty as described in the Torah and the rabbinic understanding of the oral law.

Maimonides describes the world to come as the stage after a person lives their life in this world as well as the final state of existence after the Messianic Era. Some time after the resurrection of the dead, souls will live forever without bodies. They will enjoy the radiance of the Divine Presence without the need for food, drink or sexual pleasures.

===Maimonides and Kabbalah===
Maimonides was not known as a supporter of Kabbalah, although a strong intellectual type of mysticism has been discerned in his philosophy. In &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, Maimonides declares his intention to conceal from the average reader his explanations of esoteric meanings of Torah. The nature of these &quot;secrets&quot; is debated. Religious Jewish rationalists, and the mainstream academic view, read Maimonides&#x27; Aristotelianism as a mutually-exclusive alternative metaphysics to Kabbalah. Some academics hold that Maimonides&#x27; project fought against the Proto-Kabbalah of his time.

Maimonides employed rationalism to defend Judaism rather than limit inquiry of only to rationalism. His rationalism, if not taken as an opposition, also assisted the Kabbalists, purifying their transmitted teaching from mistaken corporeal interpretations that could have been made from Hekhalot literature, though Kabbalists held that their theosophy alone allowed human access to Divine mysteries.

==Influence and legacy==

Maimonides&#x27; is considered by Jews even today as one of the chief authoritative codifications of Jewish law and ethics. It is exceptional for its logical construction, concise and clear expression and extraordinary learning, so that it became a standard against which other later codifications were often measured. It is still closely studied in rabbinic (seminaries). The first to compile a comprehensive lexicon containing an alphabetically arranged list of difficult words found in Maimonides&#x27; was Tanḥum ha-Yerushalmi (1220–1291). A popular medieval saying that also served as his epitaph states, &quot;From Mosheh [of the Torah] to Mosheh [Maimonides] there was none like Mosheh.&quot; It chiefly referred to his rabbinic writings.

However, Maimonides was also one of the most influential figures in medieval Jewish philosophy. His adaptation of Aristotelian thought to Biblical faith deeply impressed later Jewish thinkers, and had an unexpected immediate historical impact. Some more acculturated Jews in the century that followed his death, particularly in Spain, sought to apply Maimonides&#x27; Aristotelianism in ways that undercut traditionalist belief and observance, giving rise to an intellectual controversy in Spanish and southern French Jewish circles. The intensity of debate spurred Catholic Church interventions against &quot;heresy&quot; and a general confiscation of rabbinic texts.

In reaction, the more radical interpretations of Maimonides were defeated. At least amongst Ashkenazi Jews, there was a tendency to ignore his specifically philosophical writings and to stress instead the rabbinic and halakhic writings. These writings often included considerable philosophical chapters or discussions in support of halakhic observance; David Hartman observes that Maimonides clearly expressed &quot;the traditional support for a philosophical understanding of God both in the Aggadah of Talmud and in the behavior of the hasid [the pious Jew].&quot; Maimonidean thought continues to influence traditionally observant Jews.

The most rigorous medieval critique of Maimonides is Hasdai Crescas&#x27; . Crescas bucked the eclectic trend, by demolishing the certainty of the Aristotelian world-view, not only in religious matters but also in the most basic areas of medieval science (such as physics and geometry). Crescas&#x27; critique provoked a number of 15th-century scholars to write defenses of Maimonides.

Because of his path-finding synthesis of Aristotle and Biblical faith, Maimonides had an influence on Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas who refers to Maimonides in several of his works, including the &quot;Commentary on the Sentences&quot;.

Maimonides&#x27; combined abilities in the fields of theology, philosophy and medicine make his work attractive today as a source during discussions of evolving norms in these fields, particularly medicine. An example is the modern citation of his method of determining death of the body in the controversy regarding declaration of death to permit organ donation for transplantation.

===Maimonides and the Modernists===

Maimonides remains one of the most widely debated Jewish thinkers among modern scholars. He has been adopted as a symbol and an intellectual hero by almost all major movements in modern Judaism, and has proven important to philosophers such as Leo Strauss; and his views on the importance of humility have been taken up by modern humanist philosophers.
In academia, particularly within the area of Jewish Studies, the teaching of Maimonides has been dominated by traditional scholars, generally Orthodox, who place a very strong emphasis on Maimonides as a rationalist; one result is that certain sides of Maimonides&#x27; thought, including his opposition to anthropocentrism, have been obviated. There are movements in some postmodern circles to claim Maimonides for other purposes, as within the discourse of ecotheology. Maimonides&#x27; reconciliation of the philosophical and the traditional has given his legacy an extremely diverse and dynamic quality.

===Tributes and memorials===

Maimonides has been memorialized in numerous ways. For example, one of the Learning Communities at the Tufts University School of Medicine bears his name. There is also Maimonides School in Brookline, Massachusetts, Maimonides Academy School in Los Angeles, California, Lycée Maïmonide in Casablanca, the Brauser Maimonides Academy in Hollywood, Florida, and Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. Beit Harambam Congregation, a Sephardi synagogue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is named after him.

Issued from 8 May 1986 to 1995, the Series A of the Israeli New Shekel featured an illustration of Maimonides on the obverse and the place of his burial in Tiberias on the reverse on its 1-shekel bill.

In 2004, conferences were held at Yale University, Florida International University, Penn State, and Rambam Hospital in Haifa, Israel, which is named after him. To commemorate the 800th anniversary of his death, Harvard University issued a memorial volume. In 1953, the Israel Postal Authority issued a postage stamp of Maimonides, pictured.

In March 2008, during the Euromed Conference of Ministers of Tourism, The Tourism Ministries of Israel, Morocco and Spain agreed to work together on a joint project that will trace the footsteps of the Rambam and thus boost religious tourism in the cities of Córdoba, Fez and Tiberias.

Between December 2018 and January 2019 the Israel Museum held a special exhibit dedicated to the writings of Maimonides.

<text>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in  radiology to generate pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes inside the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to form images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy.

MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging and follow-up of disease. Compared to CT, MRI provides better contrast in images of soft tissues, e.g. in the brain or abdomen. However, it may be perceived as less comfortable by patients, due to the usually longer and louder measurements with the subject in a long, confining tube, although &quot;open&quot; MRI designs mostly relieve this. Additionally, implants and other non-removable metal in the body can pose a risk and may exclude some patients from undergoing an MRI examination safely.

MRI was originally called NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), but &quot;nuclear&quot; was dropped to avoid negative associations. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb radio frequency (RF) energy when placed in an external magnetic field; the resultant evolving spin polarization can induce an RF signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected. In other words, the nuclear magnetic spin of protons in the hydrogen nuclei resonates with the RF incident waves and emit coherent radiation with compact direction, energy (frequency) and phase. This coherent amplified radiation is easily detected by RF antennas close to the subject being examined. It is a process similar to masers. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarized radiation that is detected by the antennas. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in humans and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.

Since its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects, such as mummies. Diffusion MRI and functional MRI extend the utility of MRI to capture neuronal tracts and blood flow respectively in the nervous system, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within health systems has led to concerns about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis.

==Mechanism==

===Construction and physics===

In most medical applications, hydrogen nuclei, which consist solely of a proton, that are in tissues create a signal that is processed to form an image of the body in terms of the density of those nuclei in a specific region. Given that the protons are affected by fields from other atoms to which they are bonded, it is possible to separate responses from hydrogen in specific compounds. To perform a study, the person is positioned within an MRI scanner that forms a strong magnetic field around the area to be imaged. First, energy from an oscillating magnetic field is temporarily applied to the patient at the appropriate resonance frequency. Scanning with X and Y gradient coils causes a selected region of the patient to experience the exact magnetic field required for the energy to be absorbed. The atoms are excited by a RF pulse and the resultant signal is measured by a receiving coil. The RF signal may be processed to deduce position information by looking at the changes in RF level and phase caused by varying the local magnetic field using gradient coils. As these coils are rapidly switched during the excitation and response to perform a moving line scan, they create the characteristic repetitive noise of an MRI scan as the windings move slightly due to magnetostriction. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the equilibrium state. Exogenous contrast agents may be given to the person to make the image clearer.

The major components of an MRI scanner are the main magnet, which polarizes the sample, the shim coils for correcting shifts in the homogeneity of the main magnetic field, the gradient system which is used to localize the region to be scanned and the RF system, which excites the sample and detects the resulting NMR signal. The whole system is controlled by one or more computers.


MRI requires a magnetic field that is both strong and uniform to a few parts per million across the scan volume. The field strength of the magnet is measured in teslas – and while the majority of systems operate at 1.5 T, commercial systems are available between 0.2 and 7 T. 3T MRI systems, also called 3 Tesla MRIs, have stronger magnets than 1.5 systems and are considered better for images of organs and soft tissue. Whole-body MRI systems for research applications operate in e.g. 9.4T, 10.5T, 11.7T. Even higher field whole-body MRI systems e.g. 14 T and beyond are in conceptual proposal or in engineering design. Most clinical magnets are superconducting magnets, which require liquid helium to keep them at low temperatures. Lower field strengths can be achieved with permanent magnets, which are often used in &quot;open&quot; MRI scanners for claustrophobic patients. Lower field strengths are also used in a portable MRI scanner approved by the FDA in 2020. Recently, MRI has been demonstrated also at ultra-low fields, i.e., in the microtesla-to-millitesla range, where sufficient signal quality is made possible by prepolarization (on the order of 10–100 mT) and by measuring the Larmor precession fields at about 100 microtesla with highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs).

===T1 and T2===

Each tissue returns to its equilibrium state after excitation by the independent relaxation processes of T1 (spin-lattice; that is, magnetization in the same direction as the static magnetic field) and T2 (spin-spin; transverse to the static magnetic field).
To create a T1-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to recover before measuring the MR signal by changing the repetition time (TR). This image weighting is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex, identifying fatty tissue, characterizing focal liver lesions, and in general, obtaining morphological information, as well as for post-contrast imaging.

To create a T2-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to decay before measuring the MR signal by changing the echo time (TE). This image weighting is useful for detecting edema and inflammation, revealing white matter lesions, and assessing zonal anatomy in the prostate and uterus.

The information from MRI scans comes in the form of image contrasts based on differences in the rate of relaxation of nuclear spins following their perturbation by an oscillating magnetic field (in the form of radiofrequency pulses through the sample). The relaxation rates are a measure of the time it takes for a signal to decay back to an equilibrium state from either the longitudinal or transverse plane.

Magnetization builds up along the z-axis in the presence of a magnetic field, B0, such that the magnetic dipoles in the sample will, on average, align with the z-axis summing to a total magnetization Mz. This magnetization along z is defined as the equilibrium magnetization; magnetization is defined as the sum of all magnetic dipoles in a sample. Following the equilibrium magnetization, a 90° radiofrequency (RF) pulse flips the direction of the magnetization vector in the xy-plane, and is then switched off. The initial magnetic field B0, however, is still applied. Thus, the spin magnetization vector will slowly return from the xy-plane back to the equilibrium state. The time it takes for the magnetization vector to return to its equilibrium value, Mz, is referred to as the longitudinal relaxation time, T1. Subsequently, the rate at which this happens is simply the reciprocal of the relaxation time: formula_1. Similarly, the time in which it takes for Mxy to return to zero is T2, with the rate formula_2. Magnetization as a function of time is defined by the Bloch equations.

T1 and T2 values are dependent on the chemical environment of the sample; hence their utility in MRI. Soft tissue and muscle tissue relax at different rates, yielding the image contrast in a typical scan.

The standard display of MR images is to represent fluid characteristics in black-and-white images, where different tissues turn out as follows:

=== Usage by organ or system ===
MRI has a wide range of applications in medical diagnosis and around 50,000 scanners are estimated to be in use worldwide. MRI affects diagnosis and treatment in many specialties although the effect on improved health outcomes is disputed in certain cases.

MRI is the investigation of choice in the preoperative staging of rectal and prostate cancer and has a role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of other tumors, as well as for determining areas of tissue for sampling in biobanking.

==== Neuroimaging ====


MRI is the investigative tool of choice for neurological cancers over CT, as it offers better visualization of the posterior cranial fossa, containing the brainstem and the cerebellum. The contrast provided between grey and white matter makes MRI the best choice for many conditions of the central nervous system, including demyelinating diseases, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, infectious diseases, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and epilepsy. Since many images are taken milliseconds apart, it shows how the brain responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both the functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders. MRI also is used in guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer. New tools that implement artificial intelligence in healthcare have demonstrated higher image quality and morphometric analysis in neuroimaging with the application of a denoising system.

The record for the highest spatial resolution of a whole intact brain (postmortem) is 100 microns, from Massachusetts General Hospital. The data was published in NATURE on 30 October 2019.

Though MRI is used widely in research on mental disabilities, based on a 2024 systematic literature review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), available research using MRI scans to diagnose ADHD showed great variability. The authors conclude that MRI cannot be reliably used to assist in making a clinical diagnosis of ADHD.

==== Cardiovascular ====

Cardiac MRI is complementary to other imaging techniques, such as echocardiography, cardiac CT, and nuclear medicine. It can be used to assess the structure and the function of the heart. Its applications include assessment of myocardial ischemia and viability, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, iron overload, vascular diseases, and congenital heart disease.

==== Musculoskeletal ====

Applications in the musculoskeletal system include spinal imaging, assessment of joint disease, and soft tissue tumors. MRI techniques can also be used for diagnostic imaging of
systemic muscle diseases including genetic muscle diseases.

Swallowing movements of the throat and esophagus can cause motion artifacts over the imaged spine. Therefore, a saturation pulse applied over this region the throat and esophagus can help to avoid these artifacts. Motion artifacts arising due to pumping of the heart can be reduced by timing the MRI pulse according to heart cycles. Blood vessel flow artifacts can be reduced by applying saturation pulses above and below the region of interest.

==== Liver and gastrointestinal ====
Hepatobiliary MR is used to detect and characterize lesions of the liver, pancreas, and bile ducts. Focal or diffuse disorders of the liver may be evaluated using diffusion-weighted, opposed-phase imaging and dynamic contrast enhancement sequences. Extracellular contrast agents are used widely in liver MRI, and newer hepatobiliary contrast agents also provide the opportunity to perform functional biliary imaging. Anatomical imaging of the bile ducts is achieved by using a heavily T2-weighted sequence in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Functional imaging of the pancreas is performed following administration of secretin. MR enterography provides non-invasive assessment of inflammatory bowel disease and small bowel tumors. MR-colonography may play a role in the detection of large polyps in patients at increased risk of colorectal cancer.

==== Angiography ====

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) generates pictures of the arteries to evaluate them for stenosis (abnormal narrowing) or aneurysms (vessel wall dilatations, at risk of rupture). MRA is often used to evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (called a &quot;run-off&quot;). A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures, such as administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium) or using a technique known as &quot;flow-related enhancement&quot; (e.g., 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences), where most of the signal on an image is due to blood that recently moved into that plane (see also FLASH MRI).

Techniques involving phase accumulation (known as phase contrast angiography) can also be used to generate flow velocity maps easily and accurately. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is a similar procedure that is used to image veins. In this method, the tissue is now excited inferiorly, while the signal is gathered in the plane immediately superior to the excitation plane—thus imaging the venous blood that recently moved from the excited plane.

== Contrast agents ==

MRI for imaging anatomical structures or blood flow do not require contrast agents since the varying properties of the tissues or blood provide natural contrasts. However, for more specific types of imaging, exogenous contrast agents may be given intravenously, orally, or intra-articularly. Most contrast agents are either paramagnetic (e.g.: gadolinium, manganese, europium), and are used to shorten T1 in the tissue they accumulate in, or super-paramagnetic (SPIONs), and are used to shorten T2 and T2* in healthy tissue reducing its signal intensity (negative contrast agents). The most commonly used intravenous contrast agents are based on chelates of gadolinium, which is highly paramagnetic. In general, these agents have proved safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray radiography or CT. Anaphylactoid reactions are rare, occurring in approx. 0.03–0.1%. Of particular interest is the lower incidence of nephrotoxicity, compared with iodinated agents, when given at usual doses—this has made contrast-enhanced MRI scanning an option for patients with renal impairment, who would otherwise not be able to undergo contrast-enhanced CT.

Gadolinium-based contrast reagents are typically octadentate complexes of gadolinium(III). The complex is very stable (log K &gt; 20) so that, in use, the concentration of the un-complexed Gd3+ ions should be below the toxicity limit. The 9th place in the metal ion&#x27;s coordination sphere is occupied by a water molecule which exchanges rapidly with water molecules in the reagent molecule&#x27;s immediate environment, affecting the magnetic resonance relaxation time.

In December 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States announced in a drug safety communication that new warnings were to be included on all gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). The FDA also called for increased patient education and requiring gadolinium contrast vendors to conduct additional animal and clinical studies to assess the safety of these agents.
Although gadolinium agents have proved useful for patients with kidney impairment, in patients with severe kidney failure requiring dialysis there is a risk of a rare but serious illness, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, which may be linked to the use of certain gadolinium-containing agents. The most frequently linked is gadodiamide, but other agents have been linked too. Although a causal link has not been definitively established, current guidelines in the United States are that dialysis patients should only receive gadolinium agents where essential and that dialysis should be performed as soon as possible after the scan to remove the agent from the body promptly.

In Europe, where more gadolinium-containing agents are available, a classification of agents according to potential risks has been released. In 2008, a new contrast agent named gadoxetate, brand name Eovist (US) or Primovist (EU), was approved for diagnostic use: This has the theoretical benefit of a dual excretion path.

== Sequences ==
An MRI sequence is a particular setting of radiofrequency pulses and gradients, resulting in a particular image appearance. The T1 and T2 weighting can also be described as MRI sequences.

== Specialized configurations ==

=== Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ===

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is used to measure the levels of different metabolites in body tissues, which can be achieved through a variety of single voxel or imaging-based techniques. The MR signal produces a spectrum of resonances that corresponds to different molecular arrangements of the isotope being &quot;excited&quot;. This signature is used to diagnose certain metabolic disorders, especially those affecting the brain, and to provide information on tumor metabolism.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) combines both spectroscopic and imaging methods to produce spatially localized spectra from within the sample or patient. The spatial resolution is much lower (limited by the available SNR), but the spectra in each voxel contains information about many metabolites. Because the available signal is used to encode spatial and spectral information, MRSI requires high SNR achievable only at higher field strengths (3 T and above). The high procurement and maintenance costs of MRI with extremely high field strengths inhibit their popularity. However, recent compressed sensing-based software algorithms (&quot;e.g.&quot;, SAMV) have been proposed to achieve super-resolution without requiring such high field strengths.

=== Real-time ===
=== Interventional MRI ===
The lack of harmful effects on the patient and the operator make MRI well-suited for interventional radiology, where the images produced by an MRI scanner guide minimally invasive procedures. Such procedures use no ferromagnetic instruments.

A specialized growing subset of interventional MRI is intraoperative MRI, in which an MRI is used in surgery. Some specialized MRI systems allow imaging concurrent with the surgical procedure. More typically, the surgical procedure is temporarily interrupted so that MRI can assess the success of the procedure or guide subsequent surgical work.

=== Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound ===
In guided therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) beams are focused on a tissue, that are controlled using MR thermal imaging. Due to the high energy at the focus, the temperature rises to above 65 °C (150 °F) which completely destroys the tissue. This technology can achieve precise ablation of diseased tissue. MR imaging provides a three-dimensional view of the target tissue, allowing for the precise focusing of ultrasound energy. The MR imaging provides quantitative, real-time, thermal images of the treated area. This allows the physician to ensure that the temperature generated during each cycle of ultrasound energy is sufficient to cause thermal ablation within the desired tissue and if not, to adapt the parameters to ensure effective treatment.

=== Multinuclear imaging ===
Hydrogen has the most frequently imaged nucleus in MRI because it is present in biological tissues in great abundance, and because its high gyromagnetic ratio gives a strong signal. However, any nucleus with a net nuclear spin could potentially be imaged with MRI. Such nuclei include helium-3, lithium-7, carbon-13, fluorine-19, oxygen-17, sodium-23, phosphorus-31 and xenon-129. 23Na and 31P are naturally abundant in the body, so they can be imaged directly. Gaseous isotopes such as 3He or 129Xe must be hyperpolarized and then inhaled as their nuclear density is too low to yield a useful signal under normal conditions. 17O and 19F can be administered in sufficient quantities in liquid form (e.g. 17O-water) that hyperpolarization is not a necessity. Using helium or xenon has the advantage of reduced background noise, and therefore increased contrast for the image itself, because these elements are not normally present in biological tissues.

Moreover, the nucleus of any atom that has a net nuclear spin and that is bonded to a hydrogen atom could potentially be imaged via heteronuclear magnetization transfer MRI that would image the high-gyromagnetic-ratio hydrogen nucleus instead of the low-gyromagnetic-ratio nucleus that is bonded to the hydrogen atom. In principle, heteronuclear magnetization transfer MRI could be used to detect the presence or absence of specific chemical bonds.

Multinuclear imaging is primarily a research technique at present. However, potential applications include functional imaging and imaging of organs poorly seen on 1H MRI (e.g., lungs and bones) or as alternative contrast agents. Inhaled hyperpolarized 3He can be used to image the distribution of air spaces within the lungs. Injectable solutions containing 13C or stabilized bubbles of hyperpolarized 129Xe have been studied as contrast agents for angiography and perfusion imaging. 31P can potentially provide information on bone density and structure, as well as functional imaging of the brain. Multinuclear imaging holds the potential to chart the distribution of lithium in the human brain, this element finding use as an important drug for those with conditions such as bipolar disorder.

=== Molecular imaging by MRI ===
MRI has the advantages of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. MRI does have several disadvantages though. First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10−3 mol/L to 10−5 mol/L, which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. This problem stems from the fact that the population difference between the nuclear spin states is very small at room temperature. For example, at 1.5 teslas, a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength and hyperpolarization via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.

To achieve molecular imaging of disease biomarkers using MRI, targeted MRI contrast agents with high specificity and high relaxivity (sensitivity) are required. To date, many studies have been devoted to developing targeted-MRI contrast agents to achieve molecular imaging by MRI. Commonly, peptides, antibodies, or small ligands, and small protein domains, such as HER-2 affibodies, have been applied to achieve targeting. To enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agents, these targeting moieties are usually linked to high payload MRI contrast agents or MRI contrast agents with high relaxivities. A new class of gene targeting MR contrast agents has been introduced to show gene action of unique mRNA and gene transcription factor proteins. These new contrast agents can trace cells with unique mRNA, microRNA and virus; tissue response to inflammation in living brains. The MR reports change in gene expression with positive correlation to TaqMan analysis, optical and electron microscopy.

=== Parallel MRI ===
It takes time to gather MRI data using sequential applications of magnetic field gradients. Even for the most streamlined of MRI sequences, there are physical and physiologic limits to the rate of gradient switching. Parallel MRI circumvents these limits by gathering some portion of the data simultaneously, rather than in a traditional sequential fashion. This is accomplished using arrays of radiofrequency (RF) detector coils, each with a different &#x27;view&#x27; of the body. A reduced set of gradient steps is applied, and the remaining spatial information is filled in by combining signals from various coils, based on their known spatial sensitivity patterns. The resulting acceleration is limited by the number of coils and by the signal to noise ratio (which decreases with increasing acceleration), but two- to four-fold accelerations may commonly be achieved with suitable coil array configurations, and substantially higher accelerations have been demonstrated with specialized coil arrays. Parallel MRI may be used with most MRI sequences.

After a number of early suggestions for using arrays of detectors to accelerate imaging went largely unremarked in the MRI field, parallel imaging saw widespread development and application following the introduction of the SiMultaneous Acquisition of Spatial Harmonics (SMASH) technique in 1996–7. The SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) and Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA) techniques are the parallel imaging methods in most common use today. The advent of parallel MRI resulted in extensive research and development in image reconstruction and RF coil design, as well as in a rapid expansion of the number of receiver channels available on commercial MR systems. Parallel MRI is now used routinely for MRI examinations in a wide range of body areas and clinical or research applications.

=== Quantitative MRI ===
Most MRI focuses on qualitative interpretation of MR data by acquiring spatial maps of relative variations in signal strength which are &quot;weighted&quot; by certain parameters. Quantitative methods instead attempt to determine spatial maps of accurate tissue relaxometry parameter values or magnetic field, or to measure the size of certain spatial features.

Examples of quantitative MRI methods are:

* T1-mapping (notably used in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging)
* T2-mapping
* Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)
* Quantitative fluid flow MRI (i.e. some cerebrospinal fluid flow MRI)
* Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)

Quantitative MRI aims to increase the reproducibility of MR images and interpretations, but has historically require longer scan times.

Quantitative MRI (or qMRI) sometimes more specifically refers to multi-parametric quantitative MRI, the mapping of multiple tissue relaxometry parameters in a single imaging session.
Efforts to make multi-parametric quantitative MRI faster have produced sequences which map multiple parameters simultaneously, either by building separate encoding methods for each parameter into the sequence,
or by fitting MR signal evolution to a multi-parameter model.

=== Hyperpolarized gas MRI ===
Traditional MRI generates poor images of lung tissue because there are fewer water molecules with protons that can be excited by the magnetic field. Using hyperpolarized gas an MRI scan can identify ventilation defects in the lungs. Before the scan, a patient is asked to inhale hyperpolarized xenon mixed with a buffer gas of helium or nitrogen. The resulting lung images are much higher quality than with traditional MRI.

==Safety==
MRI is, in general, a safe technique, although injuries may occur as a result of failed safety procedures or human error. Contraindications to MRI include most cochlear implants and cardiac pacemakers, shrapnel, and metallic foreign bodies in the eyes. Magnetic resonance imaging in pregnancy appears to be safe, at least during the second and third trimesters if done without contrast agents. Since MRI does not use any ionizing radiation, its use is generally favored in preference to CT when either modality could yield the same information. Some patients experience claustrophobia and may require sedation or shorter MRI protocols. Amplitude and rapid switching of gradient coils during image acquisition may cause peripheral nerve stimulation.
MRI uses powerful magnets and can therefore cause magnetic materials to move at great speeds, posing a projectile risk, and may cause fatal accidents. However, as millions of MRIs are performed globally each year, fatalities are extremely rare.

MRI machines can produce loud noise, up to 120 dB(A). This can cause hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis, so appropriate hearing protection is essential for anyone inside the MRI scanner room during the examination.

===Overuse===
Medical societies issue guidelines for when physicians should use MRI on patients and recommend against overuse. MRI can detect health problems or confirm a diagnosis, but medical societies often recommend that MRI not be the first procedure for creating a plan to diagnose or manage a patient&#x27;s complaint. A common case is to use MRI to seek a cause of low back pain; the American College of Physicians, for example, recommends against imaging (including MRI) as unlikely to result in a positive outcome for the patient.

==Artifacts==

An MRI artifact is a visual artifact, that is, an anomaly during visual representation. Many different artifacts can occur during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), some affecting the diagnostic quality, while others may be confused with pathology. Artifacts can be classified as patient-related, signal processing-dependent and hardware (machine)-related.

==Non-medical use==
MRI is used industrially mainly for routine analysis of chemicals. The nuclear magnetic resonance technique is also used, for example, to measure the ratio between water and fat in foods, monitoring of flow of corrosive fluids in pipes, or to study molecular structures such as catalysts.

Being non-invasive and non-damaging, MRI can be used to study the anatomy of plants, their water transportation processes and water balance. It is also applied to veterinary radiology for diagnostic purposes. Outside this, its use in zoology is limited due to the high cost; but it can be used on many species.

In palaeontology it is used to examine the structure of fossils.

Forensic imaging provides graphic documentation of an autopsy, which manual autopsy does not. CT scanning provides quick whole-body imaging of skeletal and parenchymal alterations, whereas MR imaging gives better representation of soft tissue pathology. All that being said, MRI is more expensive, and more time-consuming to utilize. Moreover, the quality of MR imaging deteriorates below 10 °C.

==History==
In 1971 at Stony Brook University, Paul Lauterbur applied magnetic field gradients in all three dimensions and a back-projection technique to create NMR images. He published the first images of two tubes of water in 1973 in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, followed by the picture of a living animal, a clam, and in 1974 by the image of the thoracic cavity of a mouse. Lauterbur called his imaging method zeugmatography, a term which was replaced by (N)MR imaging. In the late 1970s, physicists Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur developed MRI-related techniques, like the echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique.

Raymond Damadian&#x27;s work into nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been incorporated into MRI, having built one of the first scanners.

Advances in semiconductor technology were crucial to the development of practical MRI, which requires a large amount of computational power. This was made possible by the rapidly increasing number of transistors on a single integrated circuit chip. Mansfield and Lauterbur were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their &quot;discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging&quot;.
